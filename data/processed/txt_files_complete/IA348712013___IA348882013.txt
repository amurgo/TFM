Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr I Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Mr S Jeshani instructed by Aston Brooke Solicitors

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. Pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 (SI 2008/269)  I  make  an  anonymity  order.   Unless  the  Upper
    Tribunal or court directs otherwise, no  report  of  these  proceedings
    shall directly or indirectly identify the appellants.   This  direction
    applies to both the appellants and to the respondent and a  failure  to
    comply with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

 2. These are appeals by the Secretary of State against a determination  of
    the First-tier Tribunal  (Judge  Archer)  which  allowed  each  of  the
    claimants' appeals against decisions taken on 15 August  2013  refusing
    to grant each appellant leave to remain  and  to  make  directions  for
    their removal to the Philippines under s.47 of the Immigration,  Asylum
    and Nationality Act 2006.

 3. For convenience, I will however refer to the parties as  they  appeared
    before the First-tier Tribunal.

Background

 4. The first appellant is a citizen of the Philippines who was born on  11
    July 1979.  The second appellant is her son and also a citizen  of  the
    Philippines who was born on 2 September 1997.

 5. The first appellant entered the United Kingdom on 31 January 2009 as  a
    student with leave valid until  20  October  2010.   Subsequently,  the
    first appellant's leave was extended as  a  Tier  4  (General)  Migrant
    until 17 August 2012.

 6. The second appellant entered the United Kingdom on 5 September 2011  as
    the dependant of his mother (the first appellant) who was at that  time
    a Tier 4 (General) Migrant.  He was granted leave in line with that  of
    his mother until 17 August 2012.

 7. On 14 August 2012, the appellants applied for leave to  remain  on  the
    basis of private life which they had formed in the  UK,  including  the
    first appellant's study and work as a part-time Health  Care  Assistant
    since 2009 at Four Seasons  Healthcare,  Gotton  Manor.   In  addition,
    reliance was placed upon the fact that the second  appellant  would  be
    starting to study for his GCSEs  from  September  2012.   Reliance  was
    placed upon Art 8 of the ECHR.  On 15 August  2013,  the  Secretary  of
    State refused each of the appellants' applications  for  further  leave
    under para 276ADE and Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules (HC  395  as
    amended).

The First-tier Tribunal Decision

 8. The appellants appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal.   The  appeal  was
    heard by Judge Archer on 21 November 2013.

 9. Subsequent to the appellants' applications for leave,  the  appellants'
    circumstances (in particular those of the first appellant) had changed.
     In June 2013, the first appellant had  begun  a  relationship  with  a
    British citizen, "NI" (the "sponsor").  Both appellants  had  moved  in
    with the sponsor in August 2013 and, at the date of  the  hearing,  the
    first appellant was eleven weeks pregnant.

10. Additionally, the second appellant had almost completed four of the six
    terms of his GCSE courses.

11. The judge was clearly impressed with the evidence  of  both  the  first
    appellant  and  sponsor.   He  made  a  number  of  positive   findings
    concerning the genuineness of their relationship and that it was not in
    the second appellant's best interests  to  return  to  the  Philippines
    before he completed his GCSE examinations in the summer of  2014.   The
    judge made the following findings at paras 18-20 of  his  determination
    as follows:


         "18. The first appellant and the sponsor were  credible  witnesses.
             They are both employed and have opened a joint  bank  account.
             The first entered the UK on 31 January 2009  and  was  granted
             further leave  to  remain  until  17  August  2012.   She  has
             completed NVQ level 4 in health and social care.  She works at
             Four Seasons Healthcare as a  care  assistant.   She  began  a
             relationship with the sponsor in June 2013 and is now 11 weeks
             pregnant.  Both appellants moved in with the sponsor in August
             2013.  I  have  carefully  considered  the  written  and  oral
             evidence from the appellant and the sponsor.  I find that  the
             relationship is genuine and that both parties planned to  have
             a baby.  The sponsor has three  sons  from  his  marriage  and
             stated in oral evidence that he wants to have a daughter.   He
             clearly adores the first appellant and wants  both  appellants
             to remain in the UK.


         19.  The first appellant is not in a position to marry the  sponsor
             because she is not  yet  divorced  from  her  husband  in  the
             Philippines.  She stated in oral evidence  that  she  believes
             that the divorce will come  through  in  December  2013.   The
             sponsor has three young boys from his first marriage  but  the
             mother has full custody.  He started the relationship with the
             first appellant seven months after he separated from his  wife
             (around November 2012).  His divorce is 'going through' but is
             unlikely to be imminent.  I  accept  Mr  Jeshani's  submission
             that it is highly unlikely that the  appellants  will  make  a
             successful fresh application to return to the  UK  before  the
             baby is born, if they leave now.


         20.  The second appellant entered the UK on 5  September  2011.   I
             also accept that the next seven months  are  crucial  for  the
             second appellant because he will sit his  GCSE  exams  in  the
             summer of 2014.  It is clearly not in his  best  interests  to
             return to the Philippines before then.   He  attends  Bishops'
             Fox School in Taunton and is doing well at  his  studies.   He
             has ambitions to become a surgeon.  The  first  appellant  and
             the  sponsor  have  now  provided  him  with  a  stable   home
             environment and he is determined to  do  well.   I  find  that
             return to the Philippines at this stage will  severely  damage
             his educational prospects."

12. At para 21, Judge Archer noted that the appellants' claim to remain  in
    the UK had changed "dramatically" since the applications were  made  in
    August 2013.  He said:

         "The second appellant has completed another four terms of his  GCSE
         courses.  However, the pregnancy is at a  relatively  early  stage.
         The unborn child will have a right to UK citizenship but  will  not
         be born until around  May  2014.   I  find  that  the  respondent's
         decision does not take any of these relevant factors into  account.
         No one appears to have considered EX.1.(b) i.e. whether  there  are
         insurmountable obstacles to family life with the sponsor continuing
         outside the UK.  I therefore find, taking all of these matters into
         account, that the decision is not in accordance with  the  law  and
         that the appellants are still  awaiting  a  lawful  decision.   The
         respondent  may  wish  to  consider  granting  a  short  period  of
         discretionary leave to cover the pregnancy of the first  appellant,
         progress  towards  the  divorces  and  the  exams  of  the   second
         appellant.  A further,  fully  informed,  application  for  further
         leave to remain could be made by both appellants within the  period
         of further leave."

13. As can be seen, the Judge allowed the appeal  on  the  basis  that  the
    Secretary of State's decisions were not in accordance with the law.

14. At para 26 he stated that:

         "I allow the appeals under the Immigration Rules to the extent  set
         out above."

15. At paras 23-25, Judge Archer went on to consider Art 8, as he  put  it,
    "outside the Rules".  Having set out the five-stage approach in  Razgar
    [2004] UKHL 27, at paras 24-25 he said this:


         "24. I find that there is evidence of development of  private  life
             in the  UK;  based  upon  my  findings  of  fact  above.   The
             appellants' protected rights under Article 8 are engaged.  The
             interference  is  in  accordance  with  the  law  because  the
             appellants are not currently asserting that they have a  route
             to remain under the Rules (that may  change  when  the  unborn
             baby is born).  The interference has legitimate  aims  because
             the maintenance of an effective system of immigration  control
             is a legitimate aim.  The issue is whether the interference is
             proportionate.


         25.  I find  that  removal  of  the  appellants  is  currently  not
             proportionate to the legitimate objective that is sought to be
             achieved; for all of the reasons set out above and  those  set
             out in paragraphs 34 and 39 of Mr Jeshani's skeleton argument.
              Again, the respondent may wish to consider granting  a  short
             period of discretionary leave to remain."

16. At para 27 the Judge allowed the appeals under Art 8 of the ECHR.

17. The Secretary of  State  sought  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal on the basis that the judge had been wrong to allow the appeal
    as being not in accordance with the law as s.EX.1 of  Appendix  FM  was
    not a "stand-alone provision" and the relationship  between  the  first
    appellant and sponsor did not fall within Appendix  FM.   Further,  the
    Secretary of State argued, in essence, that the  judge  had  failed  to
    give proper weight to the fact that the appellants could not  meet  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules and that their circumstances were
    not "exceptional" so as to result in an unjustifiably harsh outcome  to
    warrant allowing the appeal outside the Immigration Rules.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

18. On 9 January 2014, the First-tier Tribunal (Judge  Keane)  granted  the
    Secretary of State permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal.   Thus,
    the appeals came before me.

19. The  Secretary  of  State  was  represented  by  Mr  Richards  and  the
    appellants by Mr Jeshani.

20. First, Mr Richards submitted that the judge  was  wrong  to  allow  the
    appeal to the limited extent that he did under the Immigration Rules as
    Section EX.1 of Appendix FM was not  a  stand-alone  requirement.   The
    appellants simply could not meet the requirements of  the  Rules  since
    the  first  appellant's  relationship  with  the  sponsor  was  not   a
    relationship akin to marriage that had existed for at least  two  years
    at the date of application (see paras R-LTRP 1.1  and  Gen  1.2(iv)  of
    Appendix FM) and it was, therefore, irrelevant that  the  Secretary  of
    State had not considered under EX.1 whether there were  "insurmountable
    obstacles" to the first appellant continuing her family life  with  her
    partner in the Philippines.

21. Secondly, Mr Richards submitted that in accordance  with  the  grounds,
    the  judge  had  failed  to  identify   what   were   the   exceptional
    circumstances that justified allowing the appellants'  appeals  outside
    the Immigration Rules.

22. Mr Jeshani sought to defend the judge's determination and his reasoning
    in paras 24 and  25  that  it  was  not  proportionate  to  remove  the
    appellants.

Error of Law

23. At the conclusion of those submissions, I informed the  representatives
    that the judge's decision to allow the appeals under Art  8  could  not
    stand.  My reasons are as follows.

24. First, Mr Jeshani accepted that the judge had erred in law in  para  21
    in allowing the appeal on the limited basis that the decisions were not
    in accordance with the law.  That is entirely correct.  Section EX.1 is
    not a  'stand-alone'  provision:  the  appellant  must  also  meet  the
    requirements of R-LTRP 1.1, including that the sponsor qualifies as her
    'partner' under Gen 1.2(iv) (see, Sabir (Appendix FM -  EX.1  not  free
    standing) [2014] UKUT 63 (IAC)).   Since  their  relationship  had  not
    lasted for at least 2 years at the date of application,  the  appellant
    could not succeed under the 'partner' provisions in R-LTRP.

25. Therefore, to that extent the Secretary  of  State  succeeds  in  these
    appeals.  The Secretary of State's decisions were  in  accordance  with
    the law and the Immigration Rules.

26. Secondly, the judge failed properly to direct himself  in  relation  to
    the effect of the appellants being unable to satisfy  the  requirements
    of the Immigration Rules.  It was accepted in these  appeals  that  the
    appellants could not do so on the basis either of Appendix  FM  because
    the first appellant's relationship with the  sponsor  (though  genuine)
    was not of a sufficient duration.  The case law is clear that the  fact
    that an appellant cannot meet the requirements of the new Art  8  Rules
    is an important and significant factor to be taken into account, and to
    be given proper weight  to,  in  assessing  the  public  interest  when
    carrying out  the  proportionality  exercise  under  Art  8  (see,  for
    example, MF (Nigeria) v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 1192;  R  (Nagre)  v  SSHD
    [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin) and Gulshan (Article 8 - new  Rules  -  correct
    approach) [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC)).  Although in para 24  Judge  Archer
    refers to the fact that the appellant cannot  currently  succeed  under
    the Immigration Rules, in assessing proportionality in para 25 he fails
    to give any explicit weight to the fact that the appellants cannot meet
    the requirements of the Rules.

27. thirdly, the case law  also  makes  clear  that  it  will  only  be  in
    "exceptional" or "compelling" circumstances that,  where  an  appellant
    cannot meet the requirements of the new Art 8 Rules, that  a  grant  of
    leave under Art  8  outside  the  Rules  would  be  justified  (see  MF
    (Nigeria), Nagre and Gulshan).  Only if the individual's removal  would
    have  unjustifiably  harsh   consequences   (see   Gulshan)   will   an
    individual's removal breach Art 8.  Indeed, unless it is arguable  that
    an individual's circumstances are non-standard and will result in  such
    consequences,  it  is  not  necessary  for  a  judge  to  consider   an
    individual's claim under Art 8 outside the Rules (see Gulshan).

28. Judge Archer did not come to his decision under Art 8 outside the Rules
    applying the approach I have set out.  Further, it is  not  clear  upon
    precisely what basis he allowed the appellants' appeals  under  Art  8.
    His reasoning is brief and does not convey to the reader the underlying
    basis for his conclusion.  He refers to (and adopts) paras 34 and 39 of
    Mr Jeshani's skeleton argument.  Those paragraphs, in  particular  para
    34, seek to argue that it  would  be  disproportionate  to  remove  the
    appellants to the Philippines and, in particular,  in  order  that  the
    first appellant should seek entry clearance.  That does not seem to be,
    however, the basis upon which  Judge  Archer  allowed  the  appellants'
    appeals under Art 8.  In the final sentence of  para  25  he  commented
    that:  "the respondent may wish to consider granting a short period  of
    discretionary leave to remain." That would appear  to  be  a  reference
    back to what he had said in para  21  of  his  determination  that  the
    respondent might wish to grant a short period of discretionary leave to
    cover the period of the first appellant's pregnancy  and  in  order  to
    allow the second appellant to complete his GCSE exams in the summer  of
    2014.

29. If that was the basis upon which Judge Archer allowed the appeal, it is
    difficult to see how he could have based that upon the submissions made
    at para 34 of Mr Jeshani's skeleton which were  not  tailored  to  that
    limited basis for allowing the appeal under Art 8.

30. For these reasons, Judge Archer failed to give  sufficient  and  proper
    reasons for reaching his finding  under  Art  8  that  the  appellants'
    removals would be disproportionate.

Re-making the Decision

31. At the hearing, I heard submissions from Mr Jeshani on  behalf  of  the
    appellants and Mr Richards on behalf  of  the  Secretary  of  State  on
    remaking the decision under Art 8 of the ECHR.

32. Mr Jeshani informed me that the due date for the  birth  of  the  first
    appellant's child with the sponsor, NI is 12  June  2014  and  he  also
    handed up up-to-date evidence concerning the  progress  of  the  second
    appellant at school.  Mr Jeshani relied upon his skeleton argument  and
    the bundle of documents before the First-tier Tribunal (resubmitted  in
    an Upper Tribunal bundle).  That bundle contained a  witness  statement
    from each of the appellants and also from NI, the sponsor.

33. The principal facts are not in dispute.  They are contained in paras 18-
    20 of Judge Archer's determination which I set out above.

34. The first appellant has been in  the  UK  since  31  January  2009  and
    undertook studies, successfully completing an NVQ level 4 in Health and
    Social Care in April 2012.  She has not been a student since that time.
     She has, since May 2009, worked as a Health Care Assistant at the Four
    Seasons Healthcare, Gotton Manor.

35. In June 2013, she began a relationship with the sponsor, NI  who  is  a
    British citizen.  She and  the  second  appellant  moved  in  with  the
    sponsor in August 2013.  Both  the  first  appellant  and  sponsor  are
    married to other individuals.  At the time that the first appellant met
    the sponsor, the sponsor was separated from his wife with whom  he  has
    three sons who live with their mother.  The sponsor  is  divorcing  his
    wife.  He is the father of the first appellant's child which is due  to
    be born in June 2014.  The sponsor  is  employed  as  a  Manager  in  a
    company with a monthly salary of �1,625 plus bonuses.  From 1 May 2014,
    the sponsor's income is due to increase as a  result  of  promotion  to
    about �23,000 plus bonuses.

36. The first appellant had hoped to switch from her Tier 4  category  into
    the Tier 2 category as a Senior Carer.  However from  April  2011  that
    possibility was removed due to a change in the Rules.

37. Turning to the second appellant, he came to the UK  in  September  2011
    and has  been  studying  at  school,  beginning  his  GCSE  courses  in
    September 2012.  He is due to complete the two years of  those  courses
    and take the final examinations shortly in the  summer  of  this  year.
    There is supporting documentation concerning his progress and wellbeing
    from the school at pages 63-83 of the bundle.

38. Judge Archer found (at para 20 of his determination set out above) that
    it was not in the second appellant's best interests to  return  to  the
    Philippines before completing his examinations.  He found that for  him
    to  return  at  this  stage  would  "severely  damage  his  educational
    prospects".  Mr Richards accepted those findings stood.

39. I approach this appeal on the basis that neither appellant can  satisfy
    the requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules.   The  contrary  was  not
    suggested by Mr Jeshani.  That is a factor which must, therefore, weigh
    heavily in any Art 8 assessment.

40. I remind myself of the five-stage test in Razgar at [17].

41. I am satisfied that the appellants have established  that  Art  8.1  is
    engaged.  Judge Archer accepted, and it was not disputed before  me  by
    Mr Richards, that the first appellant's relationship with  the  sponsor
    was a genuine one.  I am satisfied that they  live  together  with  the
    second appellant as a family unit.  Both the witness statement  of  the
    sponsor and second appellant demonstrate that the relationship  between
    the sponsor and second appellant is one of a de facto stepfather and  I
    am satisfied that family life exists between them.  Of  course,  family
    life exists between the appellants.

42. Further, I am satisfied that both the first and second appellants  have
    established private life in the UK.  The first appellant has a job  and
    the  second  appellant  is  a  student  at  school.   Both   of   those
    circumstances reflect, in my judgment, a continuing private life in the
    UK.

43. I am satisfied that if the appellants are removed  to  the  Philippines
    (apart from the family life between the appellants), there will  be  an
    interference with their private and family life such as to engage Art 8
    of the ECHR.

44. Secondly, there is no doubt that the  respondent's  decisions  were  in
    accordance with the law, namely the Immigration Rules.

45. Thirdly, the decisions further the legitimate aims set out in  Art  8.2
    of furthering the  economic  well-being  of  the  country  or  for  the
    prevention of disorder or crime.

46. Fourthly, the crucial issue is one of proportionality.  That entails  a
    balancing exercise weighing the public interest against the  particular
    circumstances of the individuals and the effect upon their private  and
    family life if removed (see Razgar per Lord Bingham at [20]).  It is in
    this context that the issue  of  whether  there  are  "exceptional"  or
    "compelling" circumstances such as to give rise to unjustifiably  harsh
    consequences is engaged in order that proper weight  is  given  to  the
    public interest reflected in the fact that the appellants  cannot  meet
    the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules  (Gulshan  and  case  cited
    therein).

47. Mr Jeshani submitted that there were "exceptional"  circumstances.   He
    relied upon the fact that the sponsor had three sons in  the  UK,  aged
    12, 8 and 4 respectively, who live with their mother and if the sponsor
    were required to live in the Philippines there would be an interference
    with the family life  with  his  children.   As  regards  finances,  Mr
    Jeshani  submitted  that  the  sponsor  earned  around  �20,000  which,
    although less than required by the Rules for a  couple  with  a  child,
    namely �22,400, was above the figure suggested by Blake J in R  (MM)  v
    SSHD [2013] EWHC 1900 (Admin).  He submitted that  the  sponsor  was  a
    British citizen who had lived all his life in the UK.  It would not  be
    reasonable to expect him to leave the UK and give up  his  relationship
    with his own children whom he sees once a week.  Mr  Jeshani  submitted
    that there was no point in requiring the first appellant to  return  to
    the Philippines in order to make an entry clearance application and  he
    relied upon Chikwamba [2008] UKHL 40.  He reminded me  that  the  first
    appellant and sponsor would shortly have a British citizen child.

48. As regards the first appellant's private life, he relied upon her  work
    as a Care Assistant and that the  Rules  had  changed  to  prevent  her
    carrying on as a Tier 2 Migrant from April 2011  because  she  did  not
    have a degree or an NVQ at level 6.

49. Further, he relied upon the "best interests" of the  second  appellant.
    He submitted that the second appellant was undertaking his GCSE studies
    and was taking the examinations in May  and  June  of  this  year.   He
    referred me to the documents showing  that  the  second  appellant  was
    making progress.  He accepted that the best  interests  of  the  second
    appellant were to be with the first appellant but it was not reasonable
    to expect him to return at this moment in the middle of his GCSEs.

50. Mr Jeshani also relied upon the fact that the appellant is pregnant and
    will shortly give birth.  It was not, he  submitted,  proportionate  to
    remove her at this point.

51. Mr Jeshani invited me to allow the appeal under Art 8.

52. Mr Richards submitted that the appellants did  not  qualify  under  the
    Rules and their circumstances were not exceptional to justify the grant
    of leave outside the Rules.  He submitted that  the  first  appellant's
    pregnancy was something which she and  the  sponsor  had  brought  upon
    themselves.  He submitted that she had no expectation of remaining  now
    that her studies had concluded.  He submitted that it was reasonable to
    expect her to return to her home country and apply for entry  clearance
    under the Immigration Rules in the same way as everyone else.

53. I accept that the  appellants  cannot  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  They can do so neither on the basis of their family
    life under Appendix FM or on the basis of their private life under para
    276ADE.  In assessing proportionality,  that  fact  weighs  heavily  as
    representing the public interest.   It  will  only  be  in  exceptional
    circumstances or where there are compelling circumstances which  result
    in unjustifiably harsh consequences that that public interest  will  be
    outweighed by the impact upon the appellants or others.

54. Where a couple have formed a genuine  relationship  and  the  resulting
    family life has been developed when one  of  the  couple's  immigration
    status is "precarious", both  the  domestic  and  Strasbourg  case  law
    recognise that usually the individual's removal will  be  proportionate
    and the couple will have no right to maintain their family life in  the
    country of their choosing (see Nagre at [38]-[42], citing the  relevant
    Strasbourg case law).

55. If it were not for two particular features of these appeals, I would be
    in no doubt that it was proportionate (not being exceptional) that  the
    appellants should return to the Philippines and, at the very least, the
    first appellant seek entry clearance in order to return as the  partner
    of the sponsor.  It would not be unduly harsh, in my judgment, for  the
    first appellant to be separated from the sponsor for a period  of  time
    in order to seek entry clearance or, in the  alternative,  for  him  to
    accompany her to the Philippines in order to do so, despite the  impact
    that would, in the short-term, have on his contact with his  own  three
    sons and their 'best interests' on which I was  not  addressed  and  no
    evidence was presented.  Whether or not she would be successful is  not
    a relevant consideration (see SB (Bangladesh) v SSHD  [2007]  EWCA  Civ
    28).

56. Indeed, despite the impact upon the sponsor's three  sons,  given  that
    the appellants cannot meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules  I
    see nothing exceptional or compelling or giving rise  to  unjustifiably
    harsh consequences which would require  that  the  first  appellant  be
    permitted to carry on her family life in the UK.  Bearing in mind  that
    "insurmountable obstacles"  refers  not  to  impossible  obstacles  but
    requires consideration of the practical implications (see  Gulshan),  I
    would be satisfied that the sponsor could  reasonably  be  expected  to
    relocate to the Philippines and live with the first appellant there.  I
    reach that conclusion  bearing  in  mind  that  this  would  inevitably
    restrict the contact between the sponsor and his children.

57.  That  assessment  is,  however,  on  the  facts   of   these   appeals
    hypothetical.  That is because there are two particular features  which
    lead me to conclude that removal would be disproportionate.  They  are:
    (1) the first appellant is pregnant and her child is due in June  2014;
    (2) the second appellant is completing the  second  year  of  his  GCSE
    studies with his exams due this summer.

58. I doubt whether it is possible to remove the first appellant given  the
    stage  of  her  pregnancy  but,  in  any  event,  it  would  be  wholly
    unreasonable to do so  at  this  stage  of  the  pregnancy  and  indeed
    thereafter for a period following the birth of the child.

59. Further, in assessing proportionality, the best interests of the second
    appellant are a primary consideration (see ZH (Tanzania) v SSHD  [2012]
    UKSC 4).  I agree with Judge Archer that  the  best  interests  of  the
    second appellant are, in principle, to live with  his  mother  wherever
    she resides.  However, that is subject to this:  it would not be in the
    second appellant's best interests to disrupt his education whilst he is
    completing his GCSE courses and taking the  examinations  this  summer.
    As Judge Archer found, returning him to the Philippines "at this  stage
    will severely damage his educational prospects" (see  para  20  of  the
    determination).  I fully agree with that conclusion.  It  may  well  be
    that the fact that he is embedded in school in the UK also  means  that
    his "best interests" would not be served by preventing him carrying  on
    to take his A level exams.  I am not able to say whether  that  is  the
    case on the evidence before me and  I  heard  no  submissions  from  Mr
    Jeshani on that issue.  Given the conclusion that I reach, that can  be
    a matter which can be explored further at a subsequent time.

60. Having regard to these two factors, I am  satisfied  that  despite  the
    fact  that  the  appellants  cannot  meet  the  requirements   of   the
    Immigration Rules, their circumstances  fall  within  the  category  of
    "exceptional" or "compelling" circumstances such that their removal  at
    this point from the UK would produce unjustifiably  harsh  consequences
    and so their removal would be disproportionate.

61.  My  conclusion  is  based  upon  the  present  circumstances  of  both
    appellants.  It is not based upon any  long-term  projection  of  their
    circumstances and whether, when the features I  have  identified  above
    cease, it would be disproportionate  to  remove  them.   It  simply  is
    disproportionate at this point in time.  On the circumstances  as  they
    appertain now, the removal of the appellants would breach Art 8 of  the
    ECHR and on that basis I allow both appeals.

62. It would, in my judgment, be appropriate for the Secretary of State  to
    grant a period of leave (perhaps of six months) in order to reflect the
    continuation  of  the  compelling  circumstances  which   prevent   the
    appellants' removal.  Thereafter, it will be a matter for the Secretary
    of State, perhaps in response to any further applications made  by  the
    appellants based upon their circumstances at that  time  including  the
    birth of the child due in June 2014,  to  decide  whether  any  further
    period of leave would be appropriate.



Decision

63. The decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  allow  the  appellants'
    appeals on the basis that the Secretary of State's decision was not  in
    accordance with the law and under Art 8 of the ECHR involved the making
    of an error of law.  I set those decisions aside.

64. I re-make the decisions as follows:

      a) the decisions were in  accordance  with  the  law  and  Immigration
         Rules;

      b) the decisions breached Art 8 of the ECHR  and  on  that  basis  the
         appeals are allowed.

      c) I direct that a short period of leave (six months)  be  granted  to
         the appellants to reflect my decision.

                                                                      Signed




                                                                     A Grubb

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

Like Judge Archer, I have allowed the appeals on the basis of the totality
of the evidence presented at the hearing and consequently I do not consider
it appropriate to make a fee award.


                                                                      Signed
