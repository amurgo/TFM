Representation:

For the appellant:           Mr K Mayo, of Counsel, instructed by
                       Haq Hamilton Hughes & Co, Solicitors

For the respondent:    Mr C Buckley, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


   1. The appellant appeals with  leave  against  the  determination  of  an
      Adjudicator, Mrs N Bird, who dismissed her appeal on both  asylum  and
      humanitarian grounds.  This determination was delivered orally at  the
      hearing.

   2. The claimant is a Nigerian citizen who claims to be at risk on  return
      because she would be killed by snake worshippers.  The claimant  is  a
      Roman Catholic of the  Igbo  tribe,  who  lived  in  a  village  which
      worshipped a snake (or perhaps snakes).  She is said  to  have  killed
      'the snake' or a snake in 2000, upon  finding  it  in  her  bed.   her
      husband and foster mother died in 2003, apparently in  punishment  for
      her killing 'the snake'.  The villagers then sought out the  claimant,
      seeking as a punishment to make her  drink  the  water  in  which  her
      husband's dead body had been washed.

   3. The claimant made an excuse to return  to  her  own  home  first,  but
      instead went to the police stn and reported the problem to the police.
       She has been in the United Kingdom since June 2003. The  authorities,
      she contends, would not protect her on  return  (although  it  appears
      that a Christian policeman helped her to  escape).    The  Adjudicator
      found the claimant's account incredible, especially as  during   a  3-
      year  absence  after  the  claimant  killed  it,  the  villagers   had
      apparently not missed the  snake  they  worshipped,  .   He  also  had
      difficulty believing that the snake which the claimant killed, did not
      attempt to bite the claimant when she discovered it.

   4. Following CA [2004] EWCA All ER (D) 354,  it  is  not  enough  for  an
      appellant to disagree with the Adjudicator's findings of fact;  unless
      those findings are perverse or Wednesbury unreasonable the Tribunal is
      debarred from ousting factual findings made by an Adjudicator who  saw
      and heard the claimant give evidence.  Permission to  appeal  to  this
      Tribunal requires an arguable error of law, not fact.  Leave to appeal
      was granted on the basis that it was  possible  that  the  Adjudicator
      might have misunderstood parts of  the  appellant's  account  and,  in
      particular, that at paragraph 10 of the determination the  Adjudicator
      referred to the claimant being 'charged' but the witness statement did
      not make that claim.   Internal flight to the Catholic area of Nigeria
      should be considered.

   5. We have the benefit of a skeleton argument from Mr  Mayo  setting  out
      the appellant's claims in terms  which,  whilst  consistent  with  the
      grounds of appeal, are rather more focused.  Most of  the  Grounds  of
      Appeal as therein summarise are, on closer examination,  questions  of
      fact.  At ground 1, the skeleton argument submits that the Adjudicator
      misdirected herself in concluding that the  snake  did  not  bite  the
      applicant, as it was a well known fact that a snake would not bite  if
      not harmed.  The applicant did not harm the snake  which  reached  her
      bed, therefore there was no reason for the snake to bite  her.     The
      Adjudicator's finding that the snake did nothing to  her  "is  without
      any basis".

   6. We asked Mr  Mayo  to  clarify  this  rather  confusing  statement  he
      clarified that his position was that the snake did not bite and it was
      a habit of snakes not to bite if not harmed.   This is  not  a  matter
      which is within the personal knowledge of any member of this  Tribunal
      and it  is  possible  that  the  Adjudicator  has  applied  a  Western
      perspective, as snakes in beds are relatively uncommon in  the  United
      Kingdom.

   7. The second point made is that the applicant says that "the  snake  was
      worshipped" by the villagers and yet they did not find is strange that
      they did not see "the snake"  for  3  years.   The  skeleton  argument
      suggests that it is obvious that snake worshippers do not only worship
      one snake and it was  not  the  same  snake  to  which  the  applicant
      referred.    That is  not  consistent  with  the  applicant's  witness
      statement provided  with  her  Form  SEF,  with  her  observations  at
      interview, nor indeed with her oral evidence to the  Adjudicator,  all
      of which make it perfectly clear that  it  was  one  particular  snake
      worshipped by this village which was in question.    It is not open to
      the appellant's representatives to give evidence  on  her  behalf  and
      even if it  were,  we  would  prefer  the  appellant's  own  evidence.
      Accordingly, we uphold and rely upon the  Adjudicator's  finding  that
      the snake which was killed was a particular snake worshipped  by  that
      particular area.

   8. The next argument is that the Adjudicator's erred in considering  that
      she 'did not believe' the applicant would have  managed  to  run  away
      from the villagers to the  police  station  if  being  sought  by  the
      villagers.  The claimant repeated her assertion  that  she  asked  the
      villagers to let her go home to get her rosary,  before  drinking  the
      washed water of her husband's dead body.   On the way, she changed her
      mind and went to the  police  station,  and  the  submission  is  that
      "nothing is illogical" in her claimed actions.  Again,  that  may  be,
      but it is not determinative of this appeal, save to show the appellant
      was prepared to call on domestic protection.

   9. At ground 4, the appellant argued that when she  went  to  the  police
      station, she was just detained without specific charge, and there  was
      no evidence that she was detained under the charge  of  murdering  her
      husband as the Adjudicator concluded.  The  appellant's  own  evidence
      was that she was detained  in  connection  with  'a  murder'.   It  is
      possible there is a misinterpretation here, and  that  the  murder  in
      question was that  of  the  snake,  but  on  the  evidence  which  the
      appellant gave at interview it  is  not  likely,  even  to  the  lower
      standard applicable to these Conventions.   In any event,  whether  or
      not the appellant was charged with murder, it is clear  that  she  was
      detained for a while.

  10. At ground 5, the appellant argues that the Adjudicator  did  not  deal
      with internal flight.

  11. At ground 6, the appellant wishes us to be aware  that  the  objective
      material submitted on behalf of the Secretary of  State  shows  police
      torture, extrajudicial killings and bribe taking.    That may well  be
      so, but it did not deter the appellant from approaching the police  in
      her home area for protection.  Internal relocation does not  arise  on
      that basis.

  12. Finally, the appellant submits that  in  all  the  circumstances,  the
      Adjudicator's  fact  finding  process  is  flawed  and   without   due
      assessment of the evidence.  It is clear that this is a  challenge  to
      the  Adjudicator's  find  finding  processes.    Following   CA,   the
      Adjudicator is the fact  finder  and  the  Adjudicator's  findings  as
      challenged in the skeleton argument  are  all  soundly  based  in  the
      appellant's own evidence.

  13. We turn next to the question of  internal  flight,  the  only  serious
      point of law raised  in  this  appeal.    Mr  Buckley  submitted  that
      nothing in the present appeal would render it  unduly  harsh  for  the
      appellant to relocate to another Christian area within  Nigeria.   For
      the appellant, Mr Mayo submitted that she was a single lady who at the
      date she fled Nigeria  had  been  recently  widowed,  and  would  need
      protection internationally  on  humanitarian  grounds.   The  Tribunal
      observes that Nigeria has a population of 120 million people, and that
      there is a large Christian population and  in  particular  a  Catholic
      population.

  14. There is no evidence in this appeal that her  problems  were  anything
      other than a local dispute as a result of her killing  a  local  snake
      and accordingly, we concur with Mr  Buckley's  submission  that  there
      were no facts before the Adjudicator and are no facts before us  today
      which would indicate that it was unduly harsh to expect a  resourceful
      widowed single woman (who has been capable of coming to the other side
      of the world and beginning her life again) to take  the  much  smaller
      step of relocating internally within Nigeria to an area where she will
      be out of range of the snake worshippers in her own village.

  15. For all of the above reasons, the appellant's appeal is dismissed.
