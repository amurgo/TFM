Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr A. Razzaq-Siddiq, of counsel
For the Respondent:    Ms Z. Ahmad, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                                  DECISION
   1. The appellant, who is a citizen of Bangladesh, arrived in  the  United
      Kingdom in September 2009 and was admitted as a student. He  has  been
      granted permission  to  appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Morris  who,  by  a  determination  promulgated  on  10
      November 2016, dismissed his appeal against refusal of an  application
      for further leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur).


   2. In support of his  application  for  leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  1
      (Entrepreneur), the appellant submitted a letter  and  bank  statement
      said to be from a bank in Bangladesh called Brac  Bank  Limited.  This
      related to an account in the name of Mr Ahmad  Fazlul  Kabir  and  was
      provided by the appellant as evidence that this  person  was  to  make
      available the ï¿½200,000  required  to  meet  the  requirements  of  the
      applicable immigration  rules.  Explaining  why  the  application  was
      refused, the respondent said:


           "I am satisfied that the documents were false because Brac  Bank
           Limited have confirmed that the bank records indicate that  this
           account does not exist.
           As false documents have  been  submitted  in  relation  to  your
           application, it  is  refused  under  paragraph  322(1A)  of  the
           Immigration Rules."


   3. The difficulty that arose is that although the respondent did  produce
      a communication from Brac Bank Limited confirming that an account  did
      not exist, that communication did not relate  to  the  account  of  Mr
      Kabir, relied upon by  the  appellant,  but  to  a  different  account
      altogether that had no relevance to the application being made by  the
      appellant. Recognising this, the judge said:
           "Taken in isolation, this document is not  sufficient  to  raise
           that possibility  (that  the  bank  document  submitted  by  the
           appellant was a false one) because,  the  e-mail  correspondence
           produced by the Respondent does not relate to  the  Appellant...
           This was clearly an error,  as  pointed  out  by  the  Appellant
           himself  and  which  was  acknowledged   by   the   Respondent's
           representative at the hearing. Had the matter stopped there,  it
           is arguable that the Respondent  would  not  have  succeeded  in
           discharging the evidential burden incumbent on her."
   4. But the judge did not take that matter in isolation and did not  leave
      it to rest there. She went on to point out to the  appellant  and  his
      representative three cogent reasons for concluding that  the  document
      was, on its face, plainly a false document and then gave the appellant
      an opportunity to address those issues in evidence.


   5. The three points made by the  judge  about  the  bank  documents  were
      these:


   i. The bank statement carried a printed title "Transactins  Inquiry".  As
      this was a  template  document  that  would  be  used  constantly  for
      customers of this well-established bank, it was not credible that such
      a "fundamental spelling mistake" would have been left uncorrected;


  ii. The account opening date was said to be 29 January 2012 yet the  "Last
      Purge Date" was said to be the day before the account was opened;


 iii. It can be seen from the copy  of  this  document  in  the  appellant's
      bundle that it was taken from a web page on  12  April  2012  yet  the
      statement records transactions between April 2012  and  October  2012,
      after the date upon which the statement purports to have been produced
      and printed.


   6. Despite this being pointed out by the  judge,  the  appellant  had  no
      answer to offer. The judge recorded:
           "The Appellant  attended  the  appeal  hearing  with  his  Legal
           Representative. The anomalies in the  documents  outlined  above
           were put to him, but he did not give a satisfactory  explanation
           for them."
      Which led the judge to conclude:
           "In view of the anomalies which appear on the bank statement  in
           question, I am satisfied that notwithstanding the fact that  the
           wrong  e-mail  correspondence   had   been   included   in   the
           Respondent's  bundle,  the   Respondent   has   discharged   the
           evidential burden incumbent on her, and that sufficient evidence
           had been adduced to raise the existence of the  fact  at  issue.
           The burden therefore switches to the Appellant."
   7. Although, in the assessment of the judge,  the  appellant  offered  no
      viable explanation for the difficulties that had been identified  with
      the bank documents, he was not silent. He relied upon what he said was
      a subsequent letter from Brac Bank  Limited  dated  6  September  2016
      signed by a person identifying himself as  the  bank  manager  of  the
      branch of Brac Bank Limited concerned. In this letter it is said  that
      the bank statement and letter that had been submitted by the appellant
      with  his  application  were  "genuine  and  authentic".  This  letter
      asserted also that it was "quite impossible" for an "Associate Product
      Manager" to provide verification of the authenticity of an account  so
      that there "must have been a massive gap or  misinterpretation  within
      the verification process if any".


   8. The judge explained why she did not accept that the appellant  was  at
      all assisted by this evidence. Whether or not  the  official  who  had
      dealt with the verification enquiry produced  by  the  respondent  was
      authorised to do so took the appellant no further at  all  because  it
      was common ground and agreed between the parties that the verification
      communication did not  relate  to  the  account  relied  upon  by  the
      appellant. Secondly, this new letter was produced  a  year  after  the
      date of the refusal letter and no explanation was offered  as  to  why
      the appellant or the account holder who was providing funds waited  so
      long to secure it.  Thirdly, there was no evidence, written  or  oral,
      from Mr Kabir, the holder of this account.


   9. In short, the appellant had not addressed the difficulties  identified
      by the judge  and  so  she  found  that  he  had  not  discharged  the
      evidential burden facing him so that the judge was  satisfied  that  a
      false document had indeed been submitted by the appellant which  meant
      that the appeal against refusal of leave fell to be dismissed.


  10. There was before the judge also a ground of appeal to the effect  that
      refusal of his application for further leave  to  remain  would  bring
      about an impermissible infringement of rights protected by  article  8
      ECHR. That was also rejected by the judge.


  11. On behalf of  the  appellant,  Mr  Razzaq-Siddiq  advanced  two  brief
      submissions. First, that once the judge found that the respondent  had
      failed to discharge the evidential burden facing her, the judge should
      have enquired no further and simply allowed the appeal.   Second,  the
      reasons given  by  the  judge  for  finding  that  the  appellant  had
      submitted  a  false  document  were  not  the  reasons  given  by  the
      respondent for refusing the application. It was not, he submitted, the
      task of the judge to supply reasons that  were  not  provided  by  the
      respondent.


  12. In my judgment, neither submission is remotely arguable. The  task  of
      the judge was to decide, on the admissible evidence the parties  chose
      to put before her, whether  this  was  an  application  that  met  the
      requirements of the applicable immigration rules and  so  should  have
      been granted. The issue was not  simply  whether  the  respondent  had
      provided the correct evidence  to  support  her  conclusion  that  the
      appellant  had  submitted  a  false  document  but  whether   it   was
      established to the standard required that it was a false document.  If
      it was, this was an application that could not possibly  succeed.  The
      approach taken by the judge cannot be faulted. The appellant  and  his
      representative were put on notice of the concerns entertained  by  the
      judge. There was no application for an  adjournment  to  consider  the
      matter. The appellant  and  his  representatives  were  not  taken  by
      surprise. Not only was it they who had pointed out the  error  in  the
      verification document but the evidence relied upon by  the  judge  was
      evidence that the appellant himself had submitted. The judge did  not,
      as is asserted in the grounds, ignore the subsequent  letter  produced
      by the appellant. She  considered  that  new  evidence  carefully  and
      explained why it did not assist the appellant.


  13. Put  another  way,  it  is  entirely  clear  from  a  reading  of  the
      determination why the judge dismissed the appeal  and  she  has  given
      clear, cogent and legally sufficient reasons for having done so.


  14. Even now, the appellant has made no attempt to engage with or  explain
      away the three points put to him by the judge that led her to conclude
      that this was a false document. It is entirely clear that it was  open
      to the judge to dismiss the appeal for the reasons given and  that  in
      so doing she made no error of law, material or otherwise.


  15. Realistically, Mr A. Razzaq-Siddiq did not  seek  to  pursue  in  oral
      submissions any challenge to the decision to  dismiss  the  appeal  on
      article 8 grounds. He was plainly correct not to do  so.  This  was  a
      completely hopeless article 8 claim that had no prospect  whatever  of
      succeeding and it is impossible to identify any legitimate basis  upon
      which it could succeed and it is hard to see what rational outcome was
      open on the facts other than to reject it.
   Summary of decision:
  16. First-tier Tribunal Judge Morris made no error of law and her decision
      to dismiss the appeal is to stand

  17. The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.
