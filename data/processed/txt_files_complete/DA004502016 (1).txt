                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  against  a  decision  of
       First-tier Tribunal Judge Colyer  ('the  Judge'),  promulgated  on  4
       January 2017, in which the Judge allowed Mr Persico's appeal  against
       the decision to deport him from the United Kingdom  pursuant  to  the
       Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006.

    2. Although the section of the decision marked "Notice of Decision" only
       refers to the appeal being allowed under the EEA Regulations, at [82]
       the Judge also indicates that the appeal is allowed on  human  rights
       grounds. This is a reference to Article 8 ECHR.

Background


    3. Mr Persico was born on 2 December 1966 and is a citizen of Italy.  Mr
       Persico appellant claims to have entered the United Kingdom  in  1987
       and worked in a restaurant  which  he  left  in  approximately  1995,
       undertaking a different occupation importing and  exporting  clothing
       as a sole  trader.  Mr  Persico  claimed  he  was  self-employed  for
       approximately three years after which he moved to Glasgow when he met
       his former partner who was working with him. Mr Persico  advised  the
       Judge that he had not been absent from  the  UK  for  more  than  six
       months and had always retained an Italian passport.

    4. The Judge refers to the appropriate legal provisions  before  setting
       out his findings of fact from [23]. A detailed chronology is set  out
       at [25] in the following terms:

             a. 1980 - appellant left boarding school for catering in  Italy
                at the age of 14 in order to be schooled in Switzerland.  He
                also spent the summer working and staying  there  for  three
                months.

             b. The appellant returned  to  Italy  after  his  placement  to
                complete his schooling.

             c. 1982 - the appellant returned to Adeleoden, Switzerland  for
                three months.

             d. In October 1982, aged 16, the appellant first  travelled  to
                the United Kingdom by train to  study  English  and  started
                living in Eastbourne, Sussex.

             e.  On  5  November  1985,  the  appellant  was  convicted   at
                Eastbourne Magistrates Court for  cultivating  cannabis  and
                ordered to pay a �10 fine.

             f. 1985 - the appellant returned  to  Italy  to  undertake  his
                national service. He did this until 1987.

             g. 1987 - the appellant returned  to  the  United  Kingdom  and
                started  employment  at  [a  restaurant]  at  Kings  Street,
                Manchester. The appellant was living at [ ] Road,  Prestwick
                until 1989.

             h. 1989 - the appellant  resided  at  [  ]  Court,  Salford  in
                Manchester. This property was bought by him with a  mortgage
                provided by the Royal Bank of Scotland. The  appellant  also
                passed his driving test in the UK.

             i. From 1990 - the appellant was employed at [a restaurant]  in
                Manchester for five years.

             j. 7 April 1992 at Manchester City Magistrates he was sentenced
                for theft;  attempt/obtaining  property  by  deception;  and
                failing to surrender to bail with  a  conditional  discharge
                for 12 months on the first two and a  fine  of  �10  on  the
                third charge, plus compensation of �151.94 and costs of  �25

             l. 1997 - the  appellant  bought  a  property  at  [  ]  Drive,
                Erskine, Glasgow. The appellant had entered  a  relationship
                with [GB].

             m.  On  31  March  1999,  at  Mosley  Magistrates  Court,   for
                possession of a controlled drug Class A heroin he was  fined
                �250 with costs of �45.

             n. On 16 December 1999 for indecent assault he  was  imprisoned
                for three months.

             o. On 6 September 2001 Antonio Persico was born, the  child  of
                Mr Persico and [GB].

             p. In early in 2002 - the relationship  with  [GB]  ended.  The
                appellant moved  to  Nottingham  living  first  at  Greasley
                Drive.

             q. 11 February 2002 the appellant formed  a  relationship  with
                [SS].

             r. On 24 May 2002 at  Glasgow  Sheriff's  Court  appellant  was
                convicted of drink driving and fined �400  and  disqualified
                from driving for three years.

             s. On 12 June 2002 at Forfar Sheriff's Court for driving whilst
                disqualified the appellant was fined �400  and  disqualified
                from driving for four years.

             t. On 13 June 2002 at  South  Lakeland  Magistrates  Court  for
                driving with excess alcohol the appellant  was  disqualified
                for three years, fined �400 and costs of �58. For failing to
                surrender for bail the appellant was fined �100

             u. In March 2003, the appellant was imprisoned  for  12  months
                for  dangerous  driving,  serving  his   sentence   at   HMP
                Manchester and then moving to HMP Sudbury for the  remainder
                of his sentence.

             v. On 28 September  2004,  the  appellant  appeared  at  Oldham
                Magistrates Court for various offences but he was  committed
                to the Crown Court for sentence, in custody. On  15  October
                2004 at Minshull  Street  Crown  Court  for  driving  whilst
                disqualified the appellant was imprisoned for three  months,
                for failing to stop when required, using  a  vehicle  whilst
                uninsured is no separate penalty, for dangerous driving  the
                appellant was imprisoned for nine  months  and  disqualified
                from driving for five years until extended test is passed.

             w. In 2004 the appellant contracted Hepatitis C and  became  in
                receipt of State benefits due to being unable to  work.  The
                appellant received treatment from the NHS.

             x. On [ ] 2006 [BP] was born to the appellant and [SS].

             y. On 10 March 2008 at Glasgow  Sheriff's  Court,  for  sending
                offensive/indecent/obscene/menacing messages  the  appellant
                was fined �250.

             z. In 2009 the appellant's relationship with [SS] ended.

            aa. Of 5  January  2011  at  Nottingham  Magistrates  Court  the
                appellant was sentenced for driving whilst disqualified  for
                which he  received  a  community  order,  disqualified  from
                driving for six months and until an extended test was passed
                together with an unpaid work requirement.

            ab. March 2013 [GB] passed away.

            ac. In 2015 the appellant  started  treatment  for  his  medical
                condition including a clinical trial at the  Queens  Medical
                Centre, Nottingham.

            ad. On 16 December 2015  the  appellant  was  convicted  of  the
                production  of  class  B  controlled  drugs  (Cannabis)   at
                Nottingham Crown Court.

            ae. On 27 January 2016 the appellant was sentenced to 15  months
                imprisonment.

    5. The Judge was provided with a copy of the sentencing remarks  of  His
       Honour Judge Rafferty QC from which the following quote is set out at
       [27] of the decision:

           "Dominic Persico, it's all very well asking the court to  accept
           everything you say but tragically, when you tell  such  enormous
           lies to the police, it's not a good place for you  to  start.  I
           have absolutely no doubt that you were setting out - and  indeed
           had set  out  -  when  a  serious  commercial  cannabis  growing
           enterprise and if there had only been one  crop,  this  was  the
           first of them, you had not wasted your time equipping the second
           room to such an extent that it  was  not  going  to  happen  and
           frankly, for anyone to suggest that is quite simply losing sight
           of the truth. You maintained to the police that this was all for
           your own use. Plainly there was far too much cannabis for  that.
           Therefore, inevitably, you were producing it to sell. The  world
           and his wife, seemingly, thinks that growing  cannabis  in  this
           country and sending it on is permitted. It is not. Cannabis is a
           pernicious drug. People who take the risk come - as you  have  -
           of producing it commercially can only expect  one  outcome,  and
           that's imprisonment. I give you full credit  for  your  plea.  I
           reduce the sentence that  I  would  otherwise  have  imposed.  I
           sentence you on the basis that this is  a  category  3  case.  I
           discount the maximum sentence from three years to two and a half
           years because of the fewer number of plants  involved  than  the
           maximum in that category. I give you some further deduction.  So
           the maximum sentence for you had you had a trial would have been
           two years imprisonment. You  get  a  third  credit  because  you
           pleaded guilty at the first opportunity. So the sentence  is  15
           months imprisonment."

Error of law


    6. In relation to the level of protection available  to  Mr  Persico  in
       opposing the deportation decision made against him as a result of his
       criminality, the Judge finds at [33]

       "33.   I find the appellant's account of his personal history  to  be
           credible. I find the appellant having worked and resided in  the
           UK since early 1987. I find  that  by  1997  the  appellant  had
           qualified for the "enhanced" protection which  is  now  provided
           for under Article 28 (3) of Directive  2004/38/EC  of  29  April
           2004 on the right of citizens of  the  Union  and  their  family
           members to move and reside freely within the  territory  of  the
           Member States. This "enhanced protection" prohibits an expulsion
           measure being taken against the appellant as a Union citizen who
           has resided in the host Member State for the previous 10  years,
           except if the decision is based on "imperative grounds of public
           security."

    7. The Judge thereafter considered some case law  before  concluding  at
       [48]

       "48.   In considering the Respondents letter explaining  the  reasons
           for making a deportation order there appears to be no  full  and
           proper assessment when considering the EEA Regulations as to how
           the offence of cannabis cultivation resulting in a very low  end
           sentence of 15 months can be shown  to  require  the  Appellants
           deportation on "imperative grounds of public security". Even  if
           Regulation 21 (3) applied "serious grounds of public  policy  or
           public security" this too would require a detailed assessment of
           the offence and the risk of reoffending."

    8. At [58 - 59]:

       "58.   I find that it has not been established that the detention and
           subsequent deportation of this appellant is  necessary  in  this
           democratic society or that it was in the interests  of  national
           security, public  safety  or  the  economic  well-being  of  the
           country, or for the prevention of disorder or crime, or for  the
           protection of health or morals, or for  the  protection  of  the
           rights and freedoms of others."

       59.    The Appellant is a citizen of Italy then the  EEA  Regulations
           may apply.  I  find  it  has  not  been  established  that  this
           appellant when in the  UK  represents  a  genuine,  present  and
           sufficiently  serious  threat  to  the  public  to  justify  his
           deportation on the grounds of public policy. I find that it  has
           not been established that it is  justified  on  the  grounds  of
           public policy to deport the Appellant from the United Kingdom. I
           find that the respondent's decision is contrary  to  law  and  I
           allow the appeal on that basis."

    9. The Judge therefore appears to have considered the deportation  issue
       primarily on the basis the appellant was entitled to the higher level
       of protection, that is a requirement for imperative grounds of public
       security to justify his deportation but also, in the alternative,  to
       consider the second level of serious  grounds  of  public  policy  or
       public security.

   10. The Secretary of State's challenge to this aspect of the decision  is
       to the Judge's conclusion that the appellant  was  entitled  to  both
       levels of protection. Including the finding that having lived in  the
       UK for a continuous period of  10  years  by  1997,  Mr  Persico  was
       entitled to the highest level.

   11. In Secretary of State for the Home Department v MG (Case no  c-400/12
       CJEU) (second chamber) it was held that unlike the  requisite  period
       for acquiring a right of permanent residence  which  began  when  the
       person concerned commenced lawful residence in the post Member State,
       the 10 year period of  residence  necessary  for  the  grant  of  the
       enhanced  protection  provided  for  in  Article  28(3)(a)  must   be
       calculated by counting back from the date of  the  decision  ordering
       that person's expulsion. All relevant factors should  be  taken  into
       account when considering  the  calculation  of  the  10  year  period
       including the duration of each period of absence from the host Member
       State, the cumulative duration  and  the  frequency  of  absences.  A
       period of imprisonment was in principle capable both of  interrupting
       the continuity of the period of residence needed and of affecting the
       decision regarding the grant of enhanced  protection  provided  there
       under, even where the person concerned had resided in the host member
       state for 10 years prior to imprisonment albeit that  the  fact  that
       the  person  had  been  in  the  member  state  10  years  prior   to
       imprisonment was a factor to be taken into account.

   12. In MG (prison-Article 28(3)(a) of Citizens Directive) Portugal [2014]
       UKUT 00392 it  was  held  that  (i)  Article  28(3)(a)  of  Directive
       2004/38/EC contained the requirement that for those who  had  resided
       in the host member state for the  previous  10  years,  an  expulsion
       decision made against them must be based upon imperative  grounds  of
       public security; (ii) there was a tension  in  the  judgment  of  the
       Court of  Justice  of  the  European  Communities  in  Case  C-400/12
       Secretary of State v MG in respect of the meaning  of  the  "enhanced
       protection" provision; and (iii) the judgment should be understood as
       meaning that a period of imprisonment during those 10 years  did  not
       necessarily prevent a person from qualifying for enhanced  protection
       if that person was sufficiently integrated. However, according to the
       same judgment, a period of imprisonment must have a  negative  impact
       in so far as establishing integration was concerned.

   13. In Warsame [2016] EWCA Civ 16 it was held that in Secretary of  State
       for the Home Department  v  MG  (Portugal)  (Case  C-400/12)  it  was
       established that the ten-year period of residence required to benefit
       from the enhanced protection of imperative grounds must in  principle
       be continuous and be calculated by counting back from the date of the
       deportation decision. The Court of  Justice  of  the  European  Union
       ("CJEU")  found  that,  in   principle,   periods   of   imprisonment
       interrupted the continuity of periods of residence for  the  purposes
       of granting the enhanced protection.  However,  the  CJEU  also  held
       that claimants could still qualify for enhanced  protection  if  they
       could show that they had resided in the UK during the ten years prior
       to imprisonment, but  that  depended  on  an  overall  assessment  of
       whether integrating links previously  forged  with  the  host  Member
       State had been broken. On the facts, because of an earlier period  of
       imprisonment which also broke continuity, this appellant was not  one
       of those in the narrow "maybe" category of cases contemplated  in  MG
       (Portugal) where a person has resided in the host  state  during  the
       ten years prior to imprisonment, for which a more detailed individual
       assessment of links to the host and home state would be required.

   14. It is arguable that  the  Judge  erred  in  law  in  calculating  the
       requisite 10 year period from the date of entry to the United Kingdom
       rather than counting back from the date of the  deportation  decision
       and assessing the extent of links forged in the UK and  whether  they
       had been broken. This arguably required a  more  detailed  individual
       assessment of links to the host and home state.

   15. The date of the deportation decision  is  the  12  August  2016.  The
       relevant 10 year period counting back is therefore to 12 August  2006
       for the requisite 10 year period although Mr Persico has been in  the
       United Kingdom since 1982.

   16. Mr  Persico  appears  to  have  integrated,  in  part,  although  his
       continuous commission of criminal offences does seem to indicate that
       he is a person who did not consider himself fully  integrated,  as  a
       person who is integrated will want to ensure he respects the laws  of
       the United Kingdom, which acts of criminality do not demonstrate.

   17. The question is whether the  appellant  was  sufficiently  integrated
       taking his circumstances as a whole. Whilst a period of  imprisonment
       may break continuity this cannot mean that  an  appellant  loses  the
       benefit of any earlier integration and effectively  starts  from  the
       year zero, as otherwise a person with substantial periods of time  in
       the United Kingdom could find them lost for even the shortest  period
       of imprisonment. The actual periods of  imprisonment  served  by  the
       appellant were noted by the Judge to be in 1999, 2003, 2004 and 2016.
       The total period to imprisonment is in the region of 37 months  in  a
       total period of over 28 years in the UK but does demonstrate  periods
       of imprisonment punctuating periods of non-custodial sentences.

   18.  The  nature  of  the  integration  includes  not  only  examples  of
       employment, which  shall  be  commented  upon  below,  but  also  the
       relationships Mr Persico has formed, purchase of property in which to
       live in the UK, and the alleged  establishment  of  his  own  import-
       export business. In addition, Mr Persico has family  members  in  the
       UK.  The Independent Social Worker provided a positive description of
       Mr Persico's relationship with his daughter. It was  also  noted  the
       appellant is a co-primary carer and provides daily  care  as  needed.
       It is also noted Mr Persico provides her with support consistent with
       the child's well-being.

   19. The Judge noted a letter from the  Roman  Catholic  Chaplain  at  HMP
       Nottingham dated 16 September 2016 in the following terms:

           "In recent years Domenico says he has been living by himself  in
           a flat away  from  his  family  due  to  his  drug  habit.  This
           specially had an effect on his relationship with his partner. He
           still saw his two children in Nottingham regularly. He  says  he
           was very involved with his biological daughter (8 years of age);
           taking her to school spending much time at weekends and holidays
           with her. He is also very involved with his stepson, aged 21 who
           also lives with his ex-partner. His younger biological son lives
           in Scotland. He says he still sees him regularly at holidays and
           weekends. Sometimes he goes to Scotland, sometimes his son comes
           and stays with his family in  Nottingham.  His  photos  show  an
           obvious closeness and family affection between them all."

   20. The longer a person has been in another Member State the greater they
       can integrate. European law recognises that a period of 10  years  is
       an important yardstick after which a person is deemed  to  have  ties
       similar to a national of that State, such that their  removal  should
       only be permitted in the  most  serious  of  circumstances.  This  is
       recognised by the enhanced level of  protection  provided  under  the
       Regulations.

   21. The decision to  make  a  deportation  order  rejected  the  enhanced
       protection on the basis that it was found not to be accepted that the
       appellant had been continuously resident in the United Kingdom for 10
       years in accordance with the  2006  Regulations.  It  was  found  the
       appellant had failed to provide documentary evidence of entry in 1987
       and consequently the decision-maker had not  given  consideration  to
       whether deportation is justified  on  imperative  grounds  of  public
       security.

   22. The findings by the Judge  that  Mr  Persico  had  been  credible  in
       relation to his employment history is also challenged in the  grounds
       seeking permission to appeal by reference  to  the  findings  of  the
       Sentencing Judge. Whilst the Sentencing Judge did find the  appellant
       had told "enormous lies" to the police  that  does  not  prevent  the
       Judge from assessing whether the evidence he was given was  truthful.
       The difficulty is the one identified in the Grounds of Appeal, namely
       that the burden is upon Mr Persico to provide evidence to support his
       assertions. Mr Persico is noted as having claimed, at  [8],  that  he
       could provide proof from the tax office of his employment but that it
       was difficult as he was in detention because  of  restrictions.  This
       issue was considered by the Upper Tribunal in AG and  others  (EEA  -
       jobseeker-so sufficient person-  proof)  Germany  [2007]  UKUT  00075
       (IAC) at [86 - 89] in which it was found the burden remained upon the
       person alleging such entitlement to prove the same. The appellant had
       the benefit of legal representation and failed to provide an adequate
       explanation for why the evidence was not  produced  at  the  hearing.
       Accepting the employment record was as Mr Persico claimed it had been
       arguably requires more detailed reasoning in light of the comments by
       the sentencing judge about  the  appellant's  propensity  to  lie  to
       authority.

   23. The Judge asserts there was no clear pattern of serious offending  by
       the appellant which would have to be justified by reference to the 11
       convictions for 24 offences including one offence against the person,
       one sexual offence, one fraud and kindred  offences,  one  theft  and
       kindred offences and three drug-related offences. The point the Judge
       may have been trying to make at [43] is that the offending  does  not
       show a clear pattern of serious  offending  when  one  looks  at  the
       nature of the offences and the sentencing. There is indeed a  variety
       of offences undertaken some more serious than others.  The  error  in
       this paragraph is the failure of the Judge to be clear in relation to
       the  point  being  made  which  is  open  to  misinterpretation,   as
       demonstrated above.

   24. At [44] the Judge indicates it is an indication of the  consideration
       of public good that a recommendation for deportation can be  made  by
       the criminal court, although there was no evidence  of  the  same  in
       this case. The Judge  appears  to  infer  that  the  failure  of  the
       Sentencing  Judge  to  recommend  deportation  is  a  point  in   the
       appellant's favour but this arguably ignores the fact that  with  the
       automatic deportation  provisions  recommendations  by  the  criminal
       courts are now few and far between. Under the  conducive  deportation
       regime one of the grounds for deportation was a recommendation by the
       court. Mr Persico is an Italian national and therefore a EEA  citizen
       in relation to which recommendations by the criminal court will  have
       little impact upon whether deportation proceedings are taken  against
       an individual, which depends upon the nature  of  the  offending  and
       other issues set out in the Regulations.

   25. The point taken in the grounds in relation to  [48]  that  the  Judge
       comments  upon  there  being  no  full  and  proper  assessment  when
       considering the  Regulations  as  to  how  the  offence  of  cannabis
       cultivation resulting in a very low sentence can be shown to  require
       the appellant's deportation on imperative grounds is noted, as is the
       fact that the actual sentence that would have been passed before  any
       discount for a guilty plea would have been two years. It is  asserted
       the Judge has not given sufficient weight to the offence or  sentence
       and the need to protect society against crime, the  wider  impact  of
       drug offences on the community at large and its consequential effects
       upon other acquisitive crime committed  to  raise  funds  to  acquire
       drugs.

   26. The Secretary of State raises the issue of drug-related offences  and
       in this regard, in Land  Baden-W�rttemberg  v  Tsakouridis  (Case  C-
       145/09) CJEU (Grand Chamber), 23 November 2010 the  claimant  had  an
       extensive criminal record, including eight counts of illegal  dealing
       in substantial quantities of narcotics as part of an organised  group
       and had been sentenced to six and a half  years'  imprisonment.   The
       Grand Chamber held  that  a  crime  in  connection  with  dealing  in
       narcotics as part of an organised group was capable of being  covered
       by the concept of 'imperative grounds of public security' within  the
       meaning of Article 28(3). Drug trafficking represented a serious evil
       for the individual and society and could reach a level  of  intensity
       that might directly threaten the physical security of the population.
       However, an expulsion measure under Article 28(3) had to be based  on
       an individual examination of the  specific  case.   Such  a  decision
       could  only  be  justified  if,  having  regard  to  the  exceptional
       seriousness of the threat, such  a  measure  was  necessary  for  the
       protection of the interests it aimed to secure,  provided  that  that
       objective could not be attained by less strict means,  having  regard
       to the length of residence of the Union citizen in  the  host  Member
       State and in particular to the serious negative consequences  such  a
       measure  may  have  for  Union  citizens  who  had  become  genuinely
       integrated into the host  Member  State  (para  49).  Furthermore,  a
       balance had to be struck between the exceptional nature of the threat
       to public security as a result of the personal conduct of the  person
       concerned by reference to the  penalties/sentences  imposed  and  the
       degree of involvement in the criminal offending against the  risk  of
       compromising the social rehabilitation of the Union  citizen  in  the
       State which he had become genuinely integrated.

   27. In PI v Oberb�rgermeisterin der Stadt Remscheid (Case C-348/09)  CJEU
       (Grand  Chamber)  it  was  said  that  European   jurisprudence   had
       established that the fight against crime in connection with  dealings
       in narcotics as part of an  organised  group  was  capable  of  being
       covered by the concept of "imperative  grounds  of  public  security"
       under Article 28(3). That concept presupposed not only the  existence
       of a threat to public security, but also that such a threat was of  a
       particularly high degree of seriousness, as reflected by the  use  of
       the words "imperative grounds" (para 15).

   28. The Judge considers the issue of rehabilitation within  the  decision
       from [50] to [57] and notes at [51] there are no probation reports or
       any professional assessment as to the risk of  further  offending  or
       details of any rehabilitation work that has been undertaken.

   29. In relation to the EEA Regulations it is  concluded  that  the  Judge
       legally erred when assessing the level  of  protection  to  which  Mr
       Persico is entitled by  material  misdirection  in  relation  to  the
       starting point for calculating whether Mr Persico  had  acquired  the
       necessary 10 years qualifying residence to entitle him to the  higher
       level of protection. It is necessary on the facts to count back  from
       the date of the deportation decision undertaking a detailed  analysis
       of Mr Persico's personal circumstances and arrangements to assess the
       nature of any integration thereafter  the  impact  upon  the  alleged
       integration  into  the  United  Kingdom  because  of   Mr   Persico's
       continuous offending. Until such an exercise has been undertaken  the
       conclusion Mr Persico is entitled to the higher level  of  protection
       is arguably unsafe and is set aside.

   30. In relation to the second level of protection, if Mr Persico had been
       exercising treaty rights as illustrated by his employment history the
       error in relation to higher level of protection might be amenable  to
       consideration with a  view  to  ascertaining  whether  the  error  is
       material. The difficulties that raised  by  the  Secretary  of  State
       which is that the Judge accepted  the  word  of  Mr  Persico  without
       proper evidence that he had been exercising  treaty  rights  for  the
       relevant period and in relation to whom it had been found  he  has  a
       propensity to lie. This aspect will require further consideration  by
       the submission of appropriate documentation which Mr  Persico  should
       be able to  obtain  from  HMRC  and  an  assessment  of  whether  the
       appropriate period of five years' residence in  accordance  with  the
       regulation has been established to qualify Mr Persico for the  second
       level of protection.

   31. Mr Hussain made  no  response  to  the  points  raised  by  Mr  Bates
       inferring, although not expressly submitted, that the extent  of  the
       area's relating to the Regulations had arguable merit.

   32. Mr Hussain focused instead on the Judge's conclusions in relation  to
       Article 8 ECHR in which the Judge concluded at [79] to [82]:

           "79.   I find that the appellant had private and family life  in
                the UK prior to his recent detention.

           80.    In summary I find that this appellant's deportation would
                be disproportionate when  considering  all  matters  in  the
                round. In  particular  I  find  that  as  a  result  of  his
                immigration detention and these proceedings I find that  the
                appellant is now aware of  the  consequences  of  crime.  In
                addition, he is now aware of the prospect of deportation and
                these combine to ensure that the appellant could be expected
                not to engage in further criminal activities. Having come to
                that  conclusion,  I  find  that   the   ultimate   aim   of
                justification of the interference has not been made out.

           81.    I find that the respondent has not established  that  the
                appellant's past criminal actions are  now  indicative  that
                the respondent is able to justify  the  decision  to  deport
                him. I take note of public interest issues but find that  in
                this particular case the appellant's personal  circumstances
                are such as to outweigh deportation factors when considering
                the proportionality of the respondent's decision.

           82.    In light  of  the  above  I  find  that  the  appellant's
                deportation from the United Kingdom was not proportionate to
                the  legitimate  aim  pursued  by  the  respondent  and  was
                therefore not necessary in a democratic society. There would
                accordingly be a violation of  Article  8  of  the  European
                Convention on Human Rights by the respondent  deporting  the
                appellant from the United Kingdom. The appeal is allowed  on
                human rights grounds."

   33. Mr Bates submitted the Article 8 findings cannot exist  in  isolation
       as  the  deportation  decision  forms  part  of  the  proportionality
       decision. As the assessment of the deportation element of the  appeal
       is flawed, this has a 'knock on' effect to the Article 8 findings.

   34. The findings in relation to the best  interest's  assessment  of  the
       children are not challenged by Mr Bates, as they are issues  of  fact
       and stand as  part  of  the  proportionality  assessment  but  it  is
       submitted that even if these findings are preserved there still needs
       to be a proper assessment of the conflicting evidence in relation  to
       Mr Persico's offending history and the  matters  relied  upon  by  Mr
       Persico.

   35. It is also said that a conflict in  relation  to  whether  a  warning
       letter had been sent by the Secretary of State prior to Mr  Persico's
       last offence and received, which had not been resolved by the Judge.

   36. The Judge was, however, fully aware of the nature of  the  offending.
       The issue of the level of protection provided under EU law  does  not
       impact upon the nature of the crimes committed  or  consequences  for
       society of those afflicted or the victims of such crimes  but  rather
       relates to  the  ability  of  a  state  to  remove  an  EEA  national
       exercising rights provided under European law from  their  territory.
       Even if the Judge was wrong in relation to the  level  of  protection
       provided  under  EU  law  that  does  not  prevent  the  Judge   from
       considering the Article 8 aspects but it is imperative that  a  judge
       does so from the correct factual foundation.

   37. It is recognised that in an  appeal  of  this  nature  a  judge  must
       consider the European aspects first and only if the  appellant  fails
       under the same does the judge need to go on  to  consider  article  8
       ECHR, if raised.

   38. When assessing Article 8 ECHR the  Judge  was  required  to  adopt  a
       structured approach as per the guidance in the case of  Razgar.  This
       is precisely what the Judge did in relation to this matter and  found
       as a result of that approach, when examining the  proportionality  of
       the decision, that with the low risk the appellant poses  to  society
       by his past criminal offending,  and  the  relationship  with  family
       members, particularly his daughter, the balance fell in Mr  Persico's
       favour.

   39. Although the Judge refers to paragraph 398 and 399 of the Immigration
       Rules and section 117 of the 2002 Act, there does not appear, on  the
       face of it, to be any specific analysis of  the  provisions  and  how
       they impact upon the proportionality decision. It is appreciated that
       the First-tier Tribunal  jurisdiction  is  that  of  a  human  rights
       jurisdiction but the Secretary of State's case  is  set  out  in  the
       Immigration  Rules.  If  the  Judge  was  to  properly  consider  the
       competing elements it is necessary to factor into the  equation  both
       the provisions under the Rules and the statutory provisions and weigh
       the outcome against the appellant's counterarguments.

   40. Although the Judge notes the Independent Social Workers criticisms of
       the respondent's failure to ascertain the wishes and feelings of  the
       child or to assess the likely effect of any change in  circumstances,
       or any harm or suffering if Mr Persico is deported  from  the  United
       Kingdom, the obligation was upon the Judge to do so  himself.  It  is
       arguable that this has not been undertaken adequately.

   41. The appellant was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment. As there is  a
       qualifying child in the United Kingdom  the  Judge  was  required  to
       assess whether it would be unduly harsh for the child  to  remain  in
       the UK without the appellant if he was deported. Guidance is given by
       the Court of Appeal in MM (Uganda)  as  to  how  such  an  assessment
       should be undertaken.

   42. It is arguable in relation to this matter that the Judge  has  failed
       to properly analyse the correct level of protection the appellant  is
       entitled to benefit from under the EEA Regulations.  The  finding  in
       the alternative does not arguably assist the appellant.  It  is  also
       arguable that the assessment of the proportionality of  the  decision
       is flawed for two reasons being, firstly, that it is based in part of
       the assessment the level of  protection  afforded  to  the  appellant
       under the EEA Regulations  and,  secondly,  as  the  Judge  fails  to
       undertake  a  sufficiently  detailed  and  proper  analysis  of   the
       competing  interests  when  assessing  the  proportionality  of   the
       decision.

   43. I therefore find the Judge has  made  legal  error  material  to  the
       decision to allow the appeal on both grounds.

   44. As the has been no proper consideration of the level  of  whether  Mr
       Persico is integrated into the United  Kingdom  and  if  so  to  what
       level, and the appropriate degree of protection available  for  which
       further detailed analysis and findings of fact  are  required.   Once
       the appropriate level of protection has been properly  identified  it
       will be necessary to consider all other relevant factors to be  taken
       into account when assessing an EEA deportation decision.  Also, as  a
       result of there being  no  proper  consideration  of  the  Article  8
       element of the appeal, there will  have  to  be  a  further  detailed
       analysis and findings of fact made. It is, therefore, appropriate for
       this  matter  to  be  remitted  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  be
       considered afresh by a judge other than Judge Colyer.





Decision

   45. The First-tier Tribunal Judge materially erred in law.  I  set  aside
       the decision of  the  original  Judge.  I  remit  the  appeal  to  be
       considered by a judge other than First-tier Tribunal Judge Colyer.

  Anonymity.

   46. The First-tier Tribunal did  not  make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
       45(4)(i) of the Asylum and  Immigration  Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
       2005.

       I make no such order pursuant to rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
       (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
