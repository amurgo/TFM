Representation:
For the Appellant:     Miss Jones instructed by Simman Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Tarlow Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.



                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is an appeal against  a  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
       Judge S Hall, promulgated on the 2 September 2011 following a hearing
       at Newport on the 31 August 2011, in which the  judge  dismissed  the
       appellants appeal against the refusal of his  claim  for  asylum  and
       direction for his removal to Afghanistan.

    2. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Pitt sitting
       as a Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  on  the  27  September  2011.
       Thereafter the case was stayed pending the publication of the country
       guidance case relating to Afghan Sikhs which has been handed down  as
       TG and others (Afghan Sikhs persecuted) Afghanistan  CG  [2015]  UKUT
       00595. Since that decision there have been further hearings including
       a CMR on the 8 April 2016 and today's hearing.

Background

    3. The appellant is a national of Afghanistan and follower of  the  Sikh
       religion.  He lives in the UK with his wife  and  two  children.  The
       eldest child, a son, was born in  Afghanistan  in  July  2009  and  a
       daughter in the UK in April 2014.

    4. At the hearing on the 8 April 2016 there was discussion  in  relation
       to the prospects of the case proceeding resulting in a  direction  in
       the following terms:
           "The  respondent  shall  notify  the  Tribunal  and  appellant's
           representative if the appellant  is  to  be  granted  status  to
           remain in light of the decision in TG and the  presence  of  two
           minor children of school age (male 10-07-2009 and female  08-04-
           2012) and health needs of the youngest child."

    5. Simman Solicitors have copied the Tribunal into a number  of  letters
       written to the respondent seeking a response  to  the  direction  and
       threatening to make an application for a wasted costs  order  if  the
       hearing proceeds.

    6. Mr Tarlow, when  asked  his  position  at  the  commencement  of  the
       hearing, applied for permission to withdraw the original decision  on
       the basis it was proposed that the matter be sent to the case  worker
       based in Cardiff for the matter to be considered further in light  of
       the current country guidance. When asked how long the referral  would
       take he indicated three months but  could  give  no  indication  that
       leave would be granted.

    7. Miss Jones opposed the application noting that the  matter  had  been
       live since 2011 and  that  the  respondent  has  had  ample  time  to
       reconsider the matter in the interim.

    8. Permission to withdraw was refused. I  agree  with  Miss  Jones  that
       ample time has passed  and  that  respondent  has  had  a  number  of
       opportunities to review the decision  if  required.  These  were  not
       taken and it is now inappropriate to  permit  a  further  substantial
       period of delay with an uncertain outcome.  This  is  not  unfair  to
       either party or in the interests of justice.

Error of law

    9. It was also established that there had been  no  finding  that  Judge
       Hall had made an error of law material to the decision to dismiss the
       appeal. The hearing therefore proceeded to  consider  this  issue  in
       relation to which it has been found that such legal  error  has  been
       made.

   10. The reasons for this finding can be summarised as follows:
        i. The  Judge  noted  the  lack  of  dispute  in  relation  to  the
           appellants claim to have been the subject of extortion,  demands
           for money with menace, an attempted kidnap of his son which  did
           not occur as he paid those responsible $3,600, which were  found
           to be the actions of a criminal gang. It was found the appellant
           failed to seek the protection of  the  authorities  and  that  a
           sufficiency of protection  exists  from  the  police  [49].  The
           country information available  showed,  however,  that  no  such
           protection to a Horvath standard existed for although the police
           could be approached the evidence was that they were not  willing
           to provide the required level of protection to a Sikh.  Although
           the case of TG was not  available  at  that  time  the  findings
           therein in relation to the lack of a sufficiency  of  protection
           also reflect the position as it was in 2011.
       ii. It is also the case that Judge Hall found the appellant had been
           subject to past persecution yet fails to consider the  relevance
           of this to the issue of future persecution.  This is relevant to
           the ability to properly answer the question "is there a  serious
           risk that on return the applicant  would  be  persecuted  for  a
           Convention reason".  Paragraph 339K  of  the  Immigration  Rules
           states that "The fact that a person has already been subject  to
           persecution or serious  harm,  or  to  direct  threats  of  such
           persecution  or  such  harm,  will  be  regarded  as  a  serious
           indication of the person's well-founded fear of  persecution  or
           real risk of suffering  serious  harm,  unless  there  are  good
           reasons to consider that such persecution or serious  harm  will
           not be repeated".  Essentially paragraph 339K  follows  the  old
           ruling in Demirkaya [1999] INLR 441.
      iii. In relation to the internal relocation, finding there  has  been
           inadequate  consideration  of  the  question  whether  this  was
           reasonable in all the circumstances for a Sikh family, who faced
           additional risk as ethic and religious minorities, with a child.
           The availability of shelter and support have not been adequately
           considered or of the existence of  other  communities  in  other
           parts of Afghanistan.

   11. The determination is set aside.  The  findings  in  relation  to  the
       credibility of the appellant's experiences in Kabul are preserved.

Discussion

   12. The Tribunal is able to remake the decision which it dos by  allowing
       the appeal. The merits  of  the  appeal  have  to  be  considered  by
       reference to the law as it stands at the date of  the  hearing  which
       now include the decision in TG and others.

   13. The key element in this case is the children. In TG it was recognised
       that Sikh children have  been  targeted  in  Afghanistan  by  way  of
       kidnap,  attacks/harassment,  forced  conversion  to  Islam,   forced
       marriage, for which there is little  redress  from  the  authorities.
       Education is only available in Sikh schools to  primary  level  after
       which Sikh children have to return to mainstream education where they
       face discrimination and the problems identified in TG.

   14. In addition, to youngest child has a serious heart condition  as  set
       out in the papers for which further surgery will be required.

   15. The children are being educated in the UK and it is not in their best
       interests to be returned to Afghanistan where there is a real risk of
       a breach of their rights under the Refugee Convention and Articles  2
       and 3.

   16. On the basis of the needs of the children these appeals are  allowed.
       As the children need their mother and father to provide  support  and
       care for them in the UK, I find it will be a breach of the  right  to
       family life to remove either parent in all the circumstances of  this
       case.

Decision

   17. The First-tier Tribunal Judge materially erred in law.  I  set  aside
       the decision of the original Judge. I remake the decision as follows.
       This appeal is allowed.

  Anonymity.

   18. The First-tier Tribunal did  not  make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
       45(4)(i) of the Asylum and  Immigration  Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
       2005.

       I make that order pursuant to  rule  14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
       (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 to prevent publication  of  any  material
       that reveals the identity of the children.

  Costs.

   19. Miss Jones sought an order for wasted costs limited  to  the  sum  of
       ï¿½450 in light of the respondent's delay and the fact the appeals  had
       been allowed which,  she  submitted,  could  have  occurred  had  the
       respondent acted with due diligence after the 8 April 2016 hearing.

   20. Although the respondent has not acted as promptly as all involved  in
       this case would have liked, the test for  a  wasted  costs  order  is
       whether  the  conduct  of  the  respondent   permits   a   reasonable
       explanation - Ridehalgh v Horsfield [1994] Ch 205 considered. In this
       case the difficulty for the appellant  is  that  there  had  been  no
       finding of material error of law. Until one was made  the  respondent
       was the beneficiary of a finding that the appellant had failed in his
       appeal. A party to a case is entitled to be heard and in light of the
       fact  an  important  procedural  step  had  not  been  resolved   the
       respondent was entitled to refuse to reconsider the matter further.

   21. I find in all the circumstances that  although  the  delay  has  been
       frustrating for the appellant a reasonable explanation exists for the
       failure to reconsider the decision. The delay in the  proceedings  is
       not as a result of the respondents actions. No order for wasted costs
       made.
