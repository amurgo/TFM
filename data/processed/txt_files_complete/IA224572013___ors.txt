Representation:

For the Appellant:     First Appellant in person
For the Respondent:    Mr G Saunders, Senior Home Office Presenting officer



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   Appeals are brought against the decisions by the respondent  to  refuse
    to issue a registration certificate  to  the  principal  appellant  and
    residence cards to the second  appellant,  his  wife,  and  the  third,
    fourth and fifth appellants, the children.  The first  appellant  is  a
    national of Portugal born on 21st August 1982.  The second appellant is
    a national of Brazil and the third, fourth  and  fifth  appellants  are
    also nationals of Brazil.

2.   It is  not  in  dispute  that  the  second,  third,  fourth  and  fifth
    appellants are dependants upon the  first  appellant's  claim  and  are
    family members of an EEA national.

3.   The central issue being whether or not he is exercising  treaty  rights
    in the United Kingdom so as to entitle him and his  family  members  to
    the residence certificates as requested.

4.   The appeal came  before  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Kimnell  on  14th
    January 2014.  The appeal was determined without  a  hearing  upon  the
    papers.  A large bundle of documents were submitted under  cover  of  a
    letter of 2nd October 2013 from London Help 4U.

5.   In the reasons for refusal dated 22nd May 2013, the Secretary of  State
    notes the documentation that was submitted including a 2011 tax return,
    2012 tax return, accountant's letters, financial  statements,  salaries
    and a letter from the employer.  Seemingly  documents  that  are  dated
    more than six weeks prior to the application will  not  be  considered.
    The decision letter regarded most of the documentation  that  had  been
    submitted to be prior to the relevant period and for  that  reason  the
    applications were refused.

6.    It has been noted that the  application  was  made  on  10th  December
    2012.

7.   The Judge sets out a number of those documents in  the  course  of  the
    decision in particular paragraph 8 as follows:-

         "Turning to the financial evidence, Vertice Services have quoted  a
         fee for preparing a tax assessment for the year 2012/2013  followed
         by  a  form  for  registering  for  self-assessment  and   national
         insurance contributions as a self-employed  sole-trader.   A  self-
         employed profit and loss account dated 13th November  2013  covered
         the period 1st April 2012 to 18th October 2012 and shows an  income
         of �5,000.  That income is consistent  with  the  salary  statement
         provided by the Embassy of the Republic of Sudan which  shows  that
         the appellant is paid as a driver at a rate of  �1,000  per  month.
         The salary statement to the end of  September  2012  is  dated  9th
         October 2012. "

8.   The Judge goes on to find that the tax returns for the tax year  ending
    2011 and  2012  are  consistent  with  the  material  provided  to  the
    respondent.

9.   However the Judge was unable, when looking at the bank  statements,  to
    identify any payment of �1,000 from  the  Embassy  of  Sudan.   Various
    transfers and various accounts  are  noted  but  the  source  of  those
    transfers was unknown.

10.      It was also noted that  in  the  bundle  of  documents  appeared  a
    balance sheet and tax return  for  the  year  ending  5th  April  2013.
    According to the computation  summary,  the  net  income  from  trading
    profit is �10,270.57, although that is annotated as being tax credit.

11.  The Judge concludes that the  evidence  does  not  establish  upon  the
    balance of probabilities that at the time of his application, or indeed
    at the hearing, the first appellant was an  employed  or  self-employed
    person exercising treaty rights in the United Kingdom.

12.  According the appeal was dismissed in respect of each and every one  of
    the appellants.

13.  Grounds of appeal were submitted against that  decision  on  the  basis
    that the Judge had not properly considered the  documentation.  Further
    it was not correct for him to require that the �1,000 must be reflected
    in the bank statements particularly when that was paid by cash.

14.  It was contended that the  documents  clearly  showed  that  the  first
    appellant was present and currently working in the UK and  economically
    active.  The comment is made that an unduly high threshold was expected
    by the Judge.

15.  Permission to  appeal  was  granted  on  the  basis  that  the  Judge's
    positive findings concerning the first appellant's  self-employment  at
    paragraphs 8, 9, 10 and 12 of the determination were inconsistent  with
    his conclusion at paragraph 13.  It was considered that the  conclusion
    appeared to be against the weight of the  evidence  and  was  for  that
    reason in error.

16.  Thus the  matter  comes  before  me  in  pursuance  of  that  grant  of
    permission.

17.   The  first  appellant  and  second  appellant  appear   unrepresented.
    Although they had the services of a legal  representative  it  did  not
    extend to their being represented at the hearing.  For the  purpose  of
    the hearing London Help 4U had prepared a  bundle  of  documents  under
    cover of a letter of 5th March 2014, together with a skeleton argument.



18.  Essentially the documents in the bundle were those that were  submitted
    before the First-tier Tribunal.
19.  The first appellant indicated that he did not  understand  why  it  was
    that the Judge did not accept that he was employed by the  embassy  and
    received the payment which was claimed.  He invited my attention to the
    original bundle that was before the First-tier Tribunal  Judge.   There
    was a letter at N1 from the Embassy of the Republic of Sudan dated 26th
    August 2011 certifying that the appellant was employed by  the  embassy
    as a chauffeur since April 2011 and received a  salary  of  �1,000  per
    month.

20.  There were further salary statements from the Embassy of  the  Republic
    on the following pages setting out from April 2011  to  September  2012
    the salary which he receives and the payment which was made.

21.  Although some reason reference is made to salary in net terms,  it  was
    apparent from the schedules that it should be read gross .

22.  He indicated that the way in which he accounted  for  his  earnings  to
    Her Majesty's Custom and Revenue was somewhat complicated  but  he  was
    only following what he was told to do namely to submit  self-assessment
    tax returns.  This he has consistently done with the  tax  returns  for
    the tax year ending 2011, 2012 and 2013.  That means he is able to  pay
    the tax that is required to be paid.

23.  In that connection my attention was drawn to page 54 of the  bundle  to
    a letter from Vertice Services of 13th November  2012.   It  was  clear
    that in accordance with HMRC guidelines, in order to legally set up  as
    a self-employed sole trader, the potential  self-employed  person  must
    register and set up a financial recordkeeping system which involves the
    completion of a self-assessment tax return every year and paying  class
    2 and class 4 national insurance contributions.

24.  It was confirmed that under HM Revenue & Customs guidelines  the  first
    appellant is recognised as self-employed and is meeting his obligations
    under the Regulations.

25.  The first appellant explained that because he  received  cash  most  of
    his payments did not go through the bank but he  met  his  obligations.
    Some of the money did find its way into his bank account as can be seen
    from his bank statements.

26.  He also pointed out that in the bundle there was also  a  letter  dated
    22nd October 2013 from  the  Embassy  of  the  Republic  of  the  Sudan
    confirming that the appellant is employed by the embassy and is paid  a
    monthly salary he being responsible for paying his own tax and national
    insurance.  In the absence of any suggestion that these  documents  are
    false it  is  difficult  to  understand  why  the  Judge  came  to  the
    conclusion that he did.

27.  A document that was not before the Judge was presented namely a  letter
    from the Embassy  of  the  Republic  of  Sudan  dated  3rd  March  2014
    confirming that the appellant was employed at a monthly salary  payable
    in cash.  His salary on that occasion was  described  at  �1300  .  The
    appellant said that he was receiving more money now than before because
    of his long service.

28.  Mr Saunders invited me to find that there was no error on the  part  of
    the Judge.  The matter had been considered  upon  the  papers  and  the
    Judge had looked at all the documents and was entitled to be  concerned
    as to the lack of any physical sign of  the  money  going  through  the
    appellant's bank account.

29.  It seems to me ,howeve,r a matter of  fundamental  importance  that  in
    giving reasons for a decision such  reasons  should  be  understood  by
    those reading the decision so to explain why the decision  came  to  be
    made.

30.  The documentation,  which  was  presented  before  the  Judge,  was  of
    considerable volume and from many sources.  There were letters from the
    accountants producing documents and  accounts.   There  were  documents
    from Her Majesty's Customs and Revenue concerning money and  tax  paid.
    There were letters from the embassy concerning the remuneration payment
    to the first appellant and confirming that he was employed by them.

31.  Clearly it is a somewhat complicated way of managing  the  finances  to
    seek to be described as self-employed, whereas in fact the easier route
    would have been to be regarded as employed and tax paid  PAYE.   It  is
    not entirely clear why that could not be done but  there  may  be  some
    difficulties for embassies I know  not.   In  any  event,  whether  the
    appellant was paid as an employee  or  whether  he  is  rightly  to  be
    regarded as self-employed,  the issue is whether  or  not  he  received
    remuneration from the embassy and was therefore properly to be regarded
    as a worker for the Regulations.

32.  If the Judge was of the view that  the  documents  were  unreliable  or
    untrue as to their nature and effect that is a finding that should have
    been made.  It would have been a bold finding in all the circumstances,
    particularly bearing in mind the standard and burden of proof  that  is
    to be applied.

33.  I recognise of course in fairness to the Judge that  dealing  with  the
    matter on the papers is sometimes very difficult, particularly  when  a
    matter of concern such as where the money is coming from and  going  to
    arises in the course of consideration.  The appellant is not  there  to
    answer such questions.

34.  As is set out in the skeleton argument ,which accompanied  the  bundle,
    there were  many documents from  so  many  sources  to  show  that  the
    appellant was present and currently working in the United  Kingdom  and
    active economically.

35.  What was raised by the respondent in the refusal letter  was  not  that
    the documents were false or unreliable but that they were not as recent
    to the application as they should have been.   That  was  not  a  point
    which was taken by the Judge in consideration of  those  documents  nor
    taken before me..  The issue was to how the first  appellant  was  paid
    and it was not raised in the reasons for refusal and seemingly has  not
    been dealt with in the bundle at all.

36.  It seems to me that as a matter of fairness, that if  this  new  aspect
    troubled the Judge as clearly it did, the  decision  should  have  been
    adjourned for clarification on that  point  or  list  it  for  an  oral
    hearing.

37.  During the course of the hearing the Judge has made no adverse  comment
    as to the documents that had been presented before him and acknowledges
    that, so far as the profit and loss accounts are  concerned,  they  are
    consistent with the salary statement provided by  the  Embassy  of  the
    Republic of the Sudan.  At no stage did the Judge indicate what  weight
    he gives those documents. By giving the documents such little weight as
    clearly he has done I  find that he has  imposed an unduly high  burden
    and standard of proof.  In such circumstances  I  uphold  the  concerns
    that were expressed in the grant of permission .I find that the Judge's
    conclusions are against the weight of the evidence and in the light  of
    no reasoned link between those documents and the absence of evidence of
    payment through a bank, the  judge  has  imposed  an  unreasonably  and
    unfair standard and burden to be met by the appellant.

38.  Accordingly I find there to be an error of law.

39.  I seek therefore to remake the decision in the light  of  the  evidence
    of the appellants and in the light of all the documents that have  been
    presented.  Mr Saunders indicated that he  did  not  want  to  ask  the
    appellant any questions and was to content to leave the  resolution  of
    the issues to me.  It is clear from looking at the bank  accounts  that
    some cash is paid into the account from time to time so as to  maintain
    a relatively modest balance. I questioned the appellant  about  certain
    entries in his bank account and he gave an explanation as to  the  sums
    involved.

40.  There are some entries which seem to be by cheque or by BAC but  I  did
    not consider that it was my task to  investigate  every  entry  in  any
    great detail.

41.  The central issue is whether or not the  appellant  is  indeed  paid  a
    salary via the embassy which he converts to his own use and is a worker
    for the purposes of the Regulations.  I find, having looked at all  the
    documents  in  particular  the  documents  from  the  embassy  and  the
    documents submitted to the Revenue and Customs, that the  appellant  is
    receiving such payment therefore is to be deemed a  worker  within  the
    2006 Regulations. I do so on the balance of probability.

42.  In those circumstances I find that he is entitled to  the  registration
    certificate.  There is no issue taken as  to  the  genuineness  of  the
    relationship as between himself and the other appellants such that they
    should be deprived of a similar grant in line with his.


43.  In the circumstances therefore the appeals of each and every  appellant
    is allowed.
