                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

   1. The appellant made a claim for protection in March 2018. He said he
      was a national of Iran who feared the authorities in his home country
      because of his political activities. He claimed to have been detained
      following a demonstration in December 2017 and then taken to prison,
      during which time he was assaulted. This included a sexual assault
      when a bottle was used.

   2. His claim was refused on 11 September 2018. It was accepted he was
      Iranian but the truth of his underlying claim was not accepted.

   3. His appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Wylie at Glasgow on
      19 October 2018. In a decision promulgated on 2 July 2018 it was
      dismissed. The judge was provided with a medical legal report stating
      that the appellant's injuries were highly consistent with the claimed
      abuse with a bottle.

   4. Under the heading `Findings 'the judge did not accept his account
      about the demonstration. At paragraph 61 the judge referred to
      objective evidence of sexual assaults being used against prisoners and
      threats that female relatives would be abused in front of them (as the
      appellant claimed happened).

   5. The judge referred to various documents provided, including medical
      reports from Iran as well as court documentation. At paragraph 81
      onwards the judge refers to a medical legal report. At paragraph 84
      the judge recorded that whilst the doctor found the injuries were
      highly consistent with the account concluded there were other possible
      reasons for the trauma. The judge did not accept that the appellant
      had been detained as claimed. Therefore, the abuse could not have
      occurred.

The Upper Tribunal

   6. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis it was arguable the
      judge reached credibility conclusions without reference to the medical
      report and the assessment was defective as set out in Mibanga [2005]
      EWCA Civ 367.

   7. By letter dated 25 March 2019 the respondent wrote to the Tribunal
      office indicating they were not opposing the application for
      permission. The letter asked the Upper Tribunal to direct a de novo
      hearing.

   8. At hearing there was no appearance on behalf of the appellant and he
      was not present. The file indicates that he and his then
      representatives were notified on 12 April 2019.There is a letter on
      file dated 3 May 2019 from Latta and Co stating they are no longer
      representing the appellant.

   9. Mr Mathews pointed out that at paragraph 50 of the decision the judge
      had referred to the need to look at the documents produced with the
      rest of the evidence. At paragraph 51 the judge referred to
      considering the evidence in the round. These were indicators fact the
      judge did consider the medical evidence before reaching a conclusion
      rather than as an afterthought. Against this, he was reluctant to go
      behind the concession in the letter from the respondent dated 25 March
      2019.

  10. The concession made was one open to the respondent and in light of it
      I would be agreeable to the decision being set aside.


 Decision.

The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Wylie materially errs in law and
is set aside. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a de
novo hearing.

Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Farrelly.





Directions

   1. Relist for a de novo hearing in the First-tier Tribunal in Glasgow
      excluding First-tier Tribunal Judge Wylie.
   2. At the original hearing the appellant unsuccessfully sought to
      introduce a claim based upon a religious conversion. The respondent
      might wish to take this opportunity to consider if this new matter
      could be dealt with at the resumed hearing assuming there has been no
      allowance in the interval.
   3. A hearing time of around 2 ï¿½ hours is anticipated.
   4. A Farsi interpreter will be required.
