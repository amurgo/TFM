Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr D Mills, Senior Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr B Singh, Counsel instructed by Direct Access






                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   In this decision the Appellant is  referred  to  as  the  Secretary  of
    State and the Respondents are referred to as the Claimants.

2.   The Claimants, nationals of Nigeria, dates of birth  8  September  1991
    and 24 April 1993, appealed against the Secretary of State's  decisions
    to refuse to vary leave to remain and to make removal directions.

3.   The Claimants' appeals came before First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Shanahan
    (the judge) who, on 30 October 2014, promulgated decisions in which  he
    allowed  the  appeals  with  reference  to  paragraph  276ADE  of   the
    Immigration Rules (the rules) and also under Article 8 of the ECHR.

4.   Permission to appeal the decisions was given on 12 December  2014.   On
    18 December 2015 I found that the judge had erred in law in considering
    both the claims as made out under Article 8 ECHR  and  under  paragraph
    276ADE of the rules.  Accordingly I issued directions for the  case  to
    be remade in the Upper Tribunal by me.

5.     At the hearing on 22 February 2016 Mr Mills, having  spoken  with  Mr
    Singh accepted that previous errors by an Entry Clearance  Officer  had
    effectively and wrongly denied the Claimants, as children of  a  mother
    present  and  settled  in  the  United  Kingdom,  from  being   granted
    indefinite leave to enter.  Such error had occurred about ten years ago
    and it was plain that there had been a denial of  rights  which  should
    have been recognised in respect of the first and second Claimants.

5.   Accordingly Mr Mills sought permission to  withdraw  the  Secretary  of
    States'  appeal  against the decision of the judge's decision  because,
    although he did not accept that the judge's reasoning was  sustainable,
    the underlying unfairness and injustice that had  been  caused  to  the
    Claimants meant that the matter  would  have  to  be  remade  and  them
    granted leave to remain.

6.   In these circumstances I agree  to  the  Secretary  of  State's  appeal
    being withdrawn, the judge's decision of 30  October  2014  stands  but
    that for other reasons the Claimants will be entitled to remain in  the
    United Kingdom, which decisions would now be issued by the Secretary of
    State.

Signed                                  Date 14 March 2016
