Representation:

For the appellant:     Mr Tony Melvin, a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the respondent:    Mr Hoa Dieu, Solicitor with N.C. Brother & Co
Solicitors

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. The Secretary of State appealed with permission against the  decision  of
   the First-tier Tribunal to allow the claimant's appeal  on  human  rights
   grounds based on her relationship with her French national  grandson  and
   her son, a British citizen.  The claimant is a citizen of Ukraine.

2. By a decision sent to  the  parties  on  4  December  2018,  I  found  no
   material error of law and upheld the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.
    In my decision, I set out the unusual factual matrix in this  appeal  at
   [13]-[17].  I held that:

         "Analysis

         26.  These grounds of appeal are really no more than  a  vigorously
         expressed disagreement with the First-tier Tribunal's  findings  of
         fact (but  not  credibility)  in  relation  to  whether  there  are
         exceptional circumstances for  which  leave  to  remain  should  be
         granted outside the Rules.

         27.  The Secretary of  State's  challenge  does  not  approach  the
         standard set for interference with factual findings by Lord Justice
         Brooke at [90] in R (Iran)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
         Department [2005] EWCA Civ 982: the First-tier Tribunal's  findings
         are neither irrational, Wednesbury unreasonable, nor  perverse,  on
         the unchallenged evidence before him. Nor do I have any  difficulty
         in understanding the Judge's reasoning.

         28.  The findings made by this judge were unarguably open to him on
         the evidence and accordingly the Secretary of State's appeal cannot
         succeed. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands."

3. On  18  December  2018,  Legal  Rights  Partnership  solicitors  made  an
   application for the claimant's costs under rule 10 (3)(d) of The Tribunal
   Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (as amended).  They  claimed  costs
   in the amount of ï¿½2025, including the costs of their out of time Rule  24
   Reply, the Upper Tribunal hearing, and the costs application itself.

4. The application was served on the Secretary of State but  no  submissions
   in reply have been received.

Claimant's costs application

5.  In  grounds  of  application  settled  by  Mr  Alasdair  Mackenzie,  the
   claimant's Counsel at the Upper Tribunal hearing, the  claimant  contends
   that the respondent should not  have  appealed  the  First-tier  Tribunal
   decision, and that it ought to have been  obvious  to  the  Secretary  of
   State at all material times, and certainly after the filing of  his  Rule
   24 Reply, that there being no challenge in the grounds of appeal  to  the
   First-tier Tribunal's findings of fact, the appeal could not succeed.

6. The core of the grounds for this application for costs is at [9]-[10]:

         "9.  Indeed, the decision of the Home Office Presenting Officer  at
         the hearing before Judge Gleeson not to press  the  challenge  with
         any vigour would appear to indicate  that  it  was  clear  to  him,
         notwithstanding the grant of permission to appeal, that the  appeal
         was unarguable.

         10.  Of course, no criticism is made of the Home Office  Presenting
         Officer at the hearing for apparently recognising  the  inevitable;
         however, a belated recognition on the [Secretary of  State's]  part
         that his challenge was  unmeritorious  is  not  a  reason  why  the
         [claimant] and her family should have been put to  the  expense  of
         being represented at the hearing.  The question is why the lack  of
         merit in the [Secretary of  State's]  appeal  was  not  appreciated
         sooner: cf. Cancino [25(iii)].  To that there is no obvious answer.
         "

7. That is the basis on which the Upper  Tribunal  is  asked  to  award  the
   claimant his costs under rule 10(3)(d).

Rule 10(3)(d) of the Upper Tribunal Rules

8. The relevant procedure rule is as follows:

         "(1) The Upper Tribunal may not make an order in respect  of  costs
         (or, in Scotland, expenses) in proceedings [transferred or referred
         by, or on appeal from,] another  tribunal  except-  [provisions  in
         relation to national security certificate appeals and under section
         4 of the Forfeiture Act 1982]...

         (3)  In other proceedings, the Upper Tribunal may not make an order
         in respect of costs or expenses except-

         ... (d) if the  Upper  Tribunal  considers  that  a  party  or  its
         representative has acted unreasonably  in  bringing,  defending  or
         conducting the proceedings; ..."

Analysis

9.  The claimant relies on the  decision  in  Cancino  (costs  -  First-tier
   Tribunal - new powers) [2015] UKFTT 59 (IAC).  That is a decision on  the
   First-tier Tribunal costs powers and not  on  the  Upper  Tribunal  power
   under rule 10.

10. Permission to appeal  was  granted  on  17  September  2018.   The  only
   remaining question is whether, following the claimant's Rule 24 Reply  on
   2 October 2018 it was unreasonable of  the  Secretary  of  State  not  to
   withdraw her appeal.

11. The decision of the  First-tier  Judge  was  that  the  application  for
   permission to appeal was arguable.  There is nothing in the Rule 24 Reply
   to suggest that the appellant considered that the respondent  was  acting
   unreasonably or should withdraw his appeal.  Nor was  any  such  argument
   made at the Upper Tribunal hearing.

12. It is not arguable that the Secretary of  State  acted  unreasonably  in
   continuing with the present appeal following  the  grant  of  permission.
   The Secretary of State was entitled to consider  that  he  had  shown  an
   arguable case, on that basis.

13. I am not satisfied that the respondent acted  unreasonably  in  bringing
   or conducting this appeal and I refuse the application for costs.
