Representation:
For the Appellant:     In person
For the Respondent:    Mr S Kandola, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Somalia, born  on  1  January  1996.   He
    arrived in the UK on 25 June 2012 as an unaccompanied minor.

 2. He applied for asylum but his application was refused.  He was however,
    granted discretionary leave to remain until 30 June 2013 as he  was  an
    unaccompanied minor.  He applied for variation of leave to remain on 24
    June 2013.  That application was also refused.

 3. The appellant appealed against that decision and his appeal came before
    First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  O'Rourke  ("the  FtJ")  on  20  May  2015.
    Following that hearing his appeal on  asylum,  humanitarian  protection
    and human rights grounds was dismissed.

 4. The grounds of appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  asserted  three  grounds,
    although permission was only granted on two of them.  Ground 1 contends
    that the FtJ  made  adverse  credibility  findings  based  on  his  own
    perception of  "reasonability".   This  ground  focuses  on  the  FtJ's
    conclusions in terms of what efforts the appellant had made  to  assist
    in the tracing of his family in Somalia.

 5. Ground 2 contends that the FtJ erred in failing to assess risk  factors
    to the  appellant  on  return  to  Somalia  cumulatively,  and  against
    relevant background information.  To that end, reliance is placed on  a
    Country Information and Guidance Report on majority clans and  minority
    groups dated March 2015 ("CIG") which it  is  asserted  post-dated  the
    decision in MOJ & Ors (Return to  Mogadishu)  Somalia  CG  [2014]  UKUT
    00442 (IAC), and which it is said affected the conclusions in MOJ,  and
    which the FtJ failed to  take  into  account.   Ground  3,  upon  which
    permission was not  granted,  involved  a  complaint  about  the  FtJ's
    conclusion that the appellant could change his appearance in  order  to
    be able to reintegrate in society in Somalia, without  risk.   The  FtJ
    had said that with reference to the submission that the length  of  the
    appellant's hair would distinguish  him  from  mainstream  Somalis,  he
    could easily remedy that.

 6. Other matters raised in the grounds at [4] and [5] contend that the FtJ
    failed  to  take  into  account  that  the  appellant  would  have   no
    independent means of support on return, and that  his  conclusion  that
    the appellant had family in Somalia was based on a presumption and  not
    on evidence.  It is further argued that the FtJ's credibility  findings
    were based on the  appellant  not  having  assisted  with  tracing  his
    family.  However, these paragraphs of the grounds are  subsumed  within
    the argument raised at Ground 1.

 7. In order to put my conclusions in context, it is necessary to refer  in
    more detail to the FtJ's decision.

    The decision of the FtJ

 8. The FtJ summarised the appellant's account which is to the effect  that
    he grew up in Mogadishu in a family of five siblings.  His father was a
    builder and his  mother  a  housewife.   The  appellant  said  that  he
    believed himself to be from the Sheekheal minority clan because that is
    what his mother told him although stressing that he  should  keep  that
    information secret.  The appellant claimed that when he was 14 years of
    age  his  father  was  killed  in  cross-fire  between  Al-Shabab   and
    government forces.  On  the  day  of  the  funeral  there  was  further
    fighting which resulted in  the  appellant  being  separated  from  his
    family, whom he had not seen since.

 9. The appellant's case was that he had approached the Red Cross  to  help
    trace his family and appointments had  been  arranged  for  him  to  be
    interviewed by them.  Letters to that effect were  produced.   He  said
    that he had provided information to the Red Cross about his family  but
    his family could not be located and the Red Cross said that they  would
    call him if they had information, but they had not contacted him.

10. The appellant claimed that after being separated  from  his  family  he
    lived on the streets and for short periods in neighbours'  houses.   He
    obtained employment and lodgings with a caf� owner who  humiliated  and
    mistreated him, also attempting sexually to assault him.  He  was  able
    to save money from his wages, eventually accumulating US$  500.   After
    the bombing of the caf� where he worked, and when the appellant was not
    actually present, he decided to leave Somalia because he did  not  feel
    safe.  He enlisted  the  assistance  of  an  agent,  and  false  travel
    documents were used.

11. Whilst in the UK he had distanced himself from the Somali community  as
    he is made to feel an outsider, due to his  clan  and  his  westernised
    appearance, being his clothes and length of  hair.   He  said  that  he
    tended to associate with western friends.  He had also been  nominated,
    via the YMCA, to be a youth delegate  at  the  'Global  Summit  to  End
    Sexual Violence in Conflict' in London in June 2014.  He  had  appeared
    in various photographs at the event and on related YouTube  clips.   He
    had also attended an event in relation to FGM in 2014.

12. He said that he feared return to Somalia because Al-Shabab would try to
    recruit him.  He also said that he would not be accepted because of his
    clan background, and he would be targeted because of his appearance and
    his stated views on sexual violence.

13. The FtJ summarised the Reasons for Refusal Letter and  the  submissions
    made on behalf of both parties.  In his conclusions he found  that  the
    appellant had not given a credible account  of  his  family  situation,
    principally because there was little evidence of him  making  any  real
    effort to locate them.  He concluded that the appellant had  not  fully
    cooperated with the Red Cross in their  enquiries,  or  instructed  his
    solicitors to authorise family tracing  by  the  respondent.   He  also
    referred to the appellant's demeanour at  the  hearing.   He  concluded
    that the appellant does in fact have some contact with his  family  but
    refuses to disclose it as it would be adverse to his claim.

14. He found that there  was  no  evidence  that  the  appellant  would  be
    discriminated against in Mogadishu on the basis of his clan membership,
    referring to the decision in MOJ and noting  expert  evidence  from  Dr
    Markus Hoehne, relied on on behalf of the appellant.

15. He referred to evidence accepted by the Tribunal in MOJ indicating that
    large numbers of  the  Somali  diaspora  have  returned  to  Mogadishu,
    rendering the wearing of western clothing and having a  foreign  accent
    unexceptional.  With reference to the length of the  appellant's  hair,
    as a basis  upon  which  he  would  be  distinguished  from  mainstream
    Somalis, he said that if that was true that was a lifestyle  choice  on
    the appellant's part, and there was no evidence of it being anything to
    do with his ethnicity or other 'protected characteristic', and which if
    the appellant generally considered would draw adverse attention to  him
    could be "easily remedied".

16. His involvement in the 'Global Summit' would not have put  him  at  any
    particular risk.  The FtJ said that there  would  have  been  countless
    such events worldwide and which huge numbers of people, including  many
    Somalis, would have been  involved.   There  was  no  evidence  of  any
    targeting of such individuals or even awareness of them  by  any  group
    which might object to the aims of such events  or  of  the  people  who
    attended.  The  YouTube  clips  would  not  have  resulted  in  adverse
    attention being brought on the appellant, there only being two of  them
    in what the FtJ described as a  media  platform  carrying  hundreds  of
    millions of videos.  He  also  concluded  that  despite  the  appellant
    apparently  suffering  criticism  generally  within   the   UK   Somali
    community, there was no evidence of anybody from that community who are
    much  more  likely  to  be  aware  of  the  Summit,  objecting  to  his
    involvement.

17. With reference again to the decision in MOJ, he said that there was  no
    real risk of forcible recruitment, including for recent returnees  from
    the west.

18. Referring to the factors relevant to  the  assessment  of  whether  the
    appellant could re-establish himself on return, again with reference to
    MOJ, he said that the appellant had left between the ages of 14 and 16,
    had  had  employment  and  accommodation,  despite   being   apparently
    separated from his family.  He was  able  to  save,  according  to  his
    evidence, US$ 500 to arrange his passage to the UK.  He concluded  that
    it was unlikely that the appellant does not have family associations in
    Mogadishu.  In any event, on his own evidence he was able to find  work
    and accommodation at a much younger age without such associations.   He
    concluded that there is no reason why, bearing in mind that he  is  now
    an adult, 3 years older, and able to speak English, as  well  as  being
    better educated, that he would not be able to find employment and as  a
    result accommodation.  He further found that there would be some family
    resources he could call upon, although he had already demonstrated  the
    ability to be self-sufficient.

19. He found  that  there  was  no  evidence  that  he  would  receive  any
    remittances from abroad.  There was no evidence that he owed  money  to
    anyone in Somalia or had exhausted any support he might  expect  there.
    That was relevant to a question raised in MOJ  as  to  why  a  person's
    ability to fund a journey to the west no longer enables an appellant to
    secure financial support on return.  He concluded  that  the  appellant
    had not explained why he would not  be  able  to  access  the  economic
    opportunities that have been produced by the 'economic boom'.

20.  He  concluded  with  reference  to  paragraph  276ADE(1)(vi)  of   the
    Immigration Rules, that there were no very "serious" obstacles  to  his
    integration into Somalia, for reasons which were explained.

    The hearing before the Upper Tribunal

21. The appellant appeared before me unrepresented.  In the  circumstances,
    I considered it appropriate to hear  submissions  from  Mr  Kandola  in
    opposition to the grounds of appeal before hearing from the  appellant.



22. Mr Kandola submitted that matters of  credibility  are  for  the  judge
    seized of the appeal.  Unless it could be  said  that  the  conclusions
    were perverse or that the judge did not take into  account  a  material
    matter, he was entitled to find as he did.

23. There was evidence that the appellant had failed to cooperate with  the
    Red Cross, which was a matter that the FtJ was entitled  to  take  into
    account.  Similarly, he was entitled  to  reject  the  claim  that  the
    appellant had no family to return to.

24. The background evidence was that there was little to indicate  problems
    for minority clan members.

25. So far as concerns the contention that the FtJ had failed to take  into
    account background evidence which post-dated MOJ, the  evidence  relied
    on was not inconsistent with MOJ.  Even if the FtJ had erred in law  in
    that respect, it was not a material error.

26. The appellant produced to me a letter dated  29  April  2016  from  the
    British Red Cross.  It begins by  referring  to  "your  recent  tracing
    enquiry" concerning a relative Isir Adam Abdi.  It states that  efforts
    to locate his mother and family are continuing but at the present  time
    they have no  information  to  give  to  him.   It  then  explains  the
    International Family Tracing service and the  principles  applied  when
    undertaking that work.  It concludes by stating that they  would  write
    to the appellant every six months about the status of his case  and  as
    soon as enquiries are completed he would be notified of the outcome.

27. The appellant said that he had attended the Red Cross because he had to
    go there every seven weeks.  He had not asked the Red Cross to  provide
    any letter to say that he had gone to appointments or attended the  two
    specific appointments referred to in the decision by the FtJ.   He  had
    no other letters to prove that he went there.  His solicitors had never
    asked him to provide such proof.

28. He said that if he has to return to Somalia  there  would  be  a  great
    risk.  He had been  in  the  UK  for  almost  five  years.   There  are
    explosions and bombs every day.  If he was sent back he would  have  no
    one to turn to because he has  no  close  or  extended  family  members
    there.  He would not know what to do.  He would not have  any  help  or
    support from anyone.

    My assessment

29. At paragraph 23(i) the FtJ said that:

         "...I did  not  find  his  evidence  as  to  his  family  situation
         credible, principally because  there  is  little  evidence  of  him
         making any real effort to locate them.  It's clear that he has  not
         co-operated fully  with  the  Red  Cross  in  their  enquiries,  or
         instructed his  solicitors  to  authorise  family  tracing  by  the
         Respondent.  Nor, at this hearing, did  he  seem  to  indicate  any
         sadness on his part at being separated from them, or any desire  to
         make contact with them.  The inference I draw from that evidence is
         that he does, in fact, have some  contact  with  them,  but  cannot
         disclose the same, as it would damage his claim."

30. I do not accept the assertion in the grounds to the effect that the FtJ
    have failed to provide any reasons for those  conclusions.   The  FtJ's
    conclusions are rooted in the evidence.  It is true that the  appellant
    had produced two letters from the Red Cross in  relation  to  interview
    appointments with them.  Those letters are dated 10 October 2013 and  6
    February 2014 and refer to appointments  on  17  October  2013  and  13
    February 2014, respectively.  The FtJ at paragraph 13 referred to  what
    appears to have been cross-examination of the appellant in relation  to
    those interviews to the effect that there was no evidence that  he  had
    ever attended them.  He recorded the appellant's evidence that  he  had
    provided information to the Red Cross about his  family  but  that  his
    family could not be located, and the Red Cross had told him  that  they
    would call him if they had information, but they had not contacted him.

31. The FtJ had referred at paragraph 19(i)  to  the  reasons  for  refusal
    letter  which  referred  to  the  respondent  having  written  to   the
    appellant's solicitors on 15 May 2014 seeking the appellant's authority
    to undertake family tracing, with the refusal letter  stating  that  no
    such authority was provided.  That is not an entirely accurate  summary
    of what is said in the refusal letter, but the distinction it seems  to
    me is not material.  At paragraph 15 of the refusal  letter  it  states
    that  a  representative  of  the  Secretary  of  State  contacted   the
    appellant's representatives, Wick and  Co,  to  request  permission  to
    undertake  action  to  trace  the  appellant's  family  members.    The
    solicitors were requested to respond to the letter within 10 days.   In
    the next paragraph it states that in their response the solicitors  had
    not consented to the Home Office undertaking tracing of family members,
    and accordingly the Secretary of State is unable to trace them  on  his
    behalf.

32. The respondent's bundle  does  not  contain  a  copy  of  the  apparent
    response from the appellant's solicitors refusing to consent to tracing
    by the Home Office.  Nevertheless, it  does  not  appear  that  it  was
    suggested on behalf of the appellant that authority was given, with the
    refusal letter expressly stating that the solicitors had not consented.
     Whether that means that there was a positive  refusal  of  consent  or
    simply a lack of response, is not clear.  In any  event,  the  FtJ  was
    correct in the summary of the refusal letter  to  state  that  no  such
    authority was provided.

33. The evidence before the FtJ therefore, was that appointments  had  been
    made for the appellant to attend  the  Red  Cross,  but  there  was  no
    evidence that he had attended.  The  appellant  did  not  produce  such
    evidence, and indeed it does  not  appear  that  it  was  suggested  in
    submissions that he had  in  fact  attended.   Furthermore,  there  was
    evidence that the respondent had written to the appellant's  solicitors
    seeking consent to tracing but no such consent  had  been  forthcoming.
    In addition, at paragraph 23(i) the FtJ said that at  the  hearing  the
    appellant did not seem to indicate any desire to make contact with  his
    family.  That was evidently the impression that the  appellant  created
    at the hearing before the FtJ.  It  was  a  matter  that  the  FtJ  was
    entitled to take into account.

34. Although I have doubts about what the FtJ said about the appellant  not
    seeming to indicate any sadness at the hearing  about  being  separated
    from his parents, no complaint is  in  fact  made  about  that  in  the
    grounds.  In any event, I am satisfied  that  there  was  a  sufficient
    evidential foundation for the FtJ's conclusions that the appellant  has
    not co-operated  fully  with  the  Red  Cross  in  their  enquiries  or
    instructed  his  solicitors  to  authorise  family   tracing   by   the
    respondent.  That in turn was a sufficient evidential springboard  from
    which the FtJ was entitled to conclude at paragraph 23(vi) that it  was
    unlikely that the  appellant  does  not  have  family  associations  in
    Mogadishu, and that it was likely  that  there  would  be  some  family
    resources he could call upon.

35.  The letter produced to me by the appellant at the hearing from the Red
    Cross, dated 29 April 2016, plainly post-dates the decision of the FtJ,
    and in any event does not have any bearing on  the  FtJ's  conclusions.
    It does not show, for example, that the FtJ  made  a  mistake  of  fact
    leading to an error of law in relation to the appellant's contact  with
    the Red Cross, and it does not have any  bearing  on  his  findings  in
    terms of the appellant's lack of co-operation.  It is simply  a  letter
    that refers to his "recent tracing enquiry".

36. Accordingly, I am not satisfied that there is any error of law  in  the
    FtJ's decision in terms of the family tracing issue or in terms of  the
    family support that the appellant could expect to rely on, on return to
    Somalia, in particular to Mogadishu.

37. In relation to Ground 2, and what is said about the  FtJ's  failure  to
    take into account the  CIG  report  of  March  2015,  I  note  that  at
    paragraph 8(iii) the FtJ referred to that as being a  report  that  was
    put before him.  He referred at paragraph  21(iii)  to  submissions  in
    relation to that report, it having been said that members  of  minority
    clans remain at a particular disadvantage  in  Mogadishu  in  accessing
    employment, healthcare and so forth.

38. More to the point however, when analysed, there is no substance to  the
    complaint that the FtJ erred in following the decision in  MOJ  in  the
    face of that, apparently later, country information.  One only needs to
    look at the extract in the grounds from  paragraph  2.5.2  of  the  CIG
    report dated March 2015 to see that the documents referred to  in  fact
    pre-date the decision in MOJ.  In the first sentence there is reference
    to an October 2013 Amnesty International Report.   The  same  paragraph
    goes on to refer to a UNHCR paper dated January 2014.  The decision  in
    MOJ was heard on several dates, up to and including 9  September  2014.
    It was signed on 10 September 2014.  That is a  sufficient  basis  from
    which to conclude  that  this  was  information  that  was  before  the
    Tribunal in MOJ.  In any event, item  40  on  the  list  of  background
    documents provided on  behalf  of  the  appellants  in  that  case,  is
    described as a UNHCR Report on International Protection  Considerations
    with Regard to people fleeing Southern and  Central  Somalia,  dated  1
    January 2014.  That would appear to be the very same document  referred
    to in the CIG report.

39. In any event, it is inconceivable that information  from  October  2013
    and January 2014 was not considered by the Tribunal in MOJ in the light
    of the considerable volume of background evidence put  before  them  at
    hearings extending up to and including September 2014, well  after  the
    date of those documents.

40. In the circumstances, I am not satisfied that there is any error of law
    in the FtJ's conclusions in terms of the asserted failure to take  into
    account background evidence.

41. As I have indicated, permission to appeal was not granted in  terms  of
    the FtJ's conclusions as regards the appellant's appearance.  The other
    paragraphs to which I have referred as set  out  in  the  grounds,  are
    subsumed within the first ground of appeal in terms of  family  tracing
    and the extent to which the appellant would  be  able  to  provide  for
    himself or find support on return.  They  do  not  raise  any  distinct
    issues for consideration.

42. It is as well to point out that although the appellant  was  no  longer
    legally  represented  at  the  hearing  before  me,  the  grounds  were
    professionally drafted by  his  previous  solicitors,  and  indeed  the
    renewed grounds to the Upper Tribunal advanced arguments as to why  the
    First-tier Judge who refused permission to appeal in the first instance
    was arguably wrong to do so.  I refer  to  the  fact  that  grounds  of
    appeal were drafted by legal representatives on the basis  that  it  is
    reasonable to assume that any arguably identifiable error  of  law  has
    been raised on behalf of the appellant.  For my part, I cannot see that
    there is any other aspect of the FtJ's decision which reveals an  error
    of law in his reasoning in any respect.  The reference by  the  FtJ  at
    paragraph 24 to very "serious" obstacles rather than the  correct  very
    significant obstacles is not significant on the facts.

43. Accordingly, this appeal must be dismissed.

    Decision

44. The decision by the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the  making  of
    an error on a point of law.  Its decision to dismiss the appeal on  all
    grounds therefore stands.


Upper Tribunal Judge Kopieczek                            18/10/16
