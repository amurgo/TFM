Representation:

For the Appellant:     In Person
For the Respondent:    Ms J Isherwood, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a national of Pakistan born on  1  October  1981.   He
    appeals with leave against the decision of First-tier  Judge  Ferguson,
    who in a decision promulgated on  1  May  2014,  dismissed  his  appeal
    against the decision of the respondent  made  on  10  January  2014  to
    refuse him further leave to remain as a Tier 4 Student.

2.   The appellant first entered the UK on 19 August 2011 with  leave  as  a
    Tier 4 Student valid until 19 January  2013.   On  the  day  his  leave
    expired he submitted a further application for leave to remain  in  the
    same capacity.

3.   The respondent refused the appellant's application on 10 January  2014.
     30 points were awarded as claimed for the production of a  valid  CAS.
    The respondent awarded him no points for maintenance because:

         "...You are required to show that you are in possession  of  �1,600
         for a consecutive 28 day period to meet the Tier 4 requirements  of
         paragraph 1A of Appendix C of  the  Immigration  Rules.   You  have
         provided no evidence of the funds available to you so you have  not
         demonstrated that you have the level of funds required".

4.   The appellant's appeal was determined  as  a  paper  case.   The  judge
    noted that the appellant had provided no  information  in  any  of  the
    sections of his appeal form which requested  the  reasons  why  he  had
    appealed.  There was no document provided with the appeal form  setting
    out any grounds of appeal.  There was no supporting  evidence  provided
    at all, specifically no bank statements or other financial documents to
    establish that he held the level of funds required by  the  Rules.   In
    view of the lack of documentary evidence to  support  his  appeal,  the
    judge dismissed his appeal.

5.   The appellant was granted permission because he had enclosed  with  his
    appeal form a copy of the Post Office slip and a copy  of  his  grounds
    which he sent to the Tribunal.   The  documents  were  contained  in  a
    separate bundle received by the Tribunal on 25 March 2014.  The  bundle
    contained the original Reasons for Refusal  Letter,  the  same  grounds
    that the appellant now enclosed with  his  grounds  for  permission  to
    appeal, an affidavit of support, a letter from a bank, a bank statement
    and a  completed  questionnaire.   The  First-tier  Judge  who  granted
    permission said it was unclear whether this bundle  was  placed  before
    the judge before he determined the appeal.  She granted  permission  on
    the basis that it is  arguable  that  the  evidence  may  have  made  a
    material  difference  to  the  outcome  or  to  the  fairness  of   the
    proceedings.

6.   The appellant confirmed that his leave to enter had  been  granted  for
    study at Wilson College.  He had studied at this college  for  four  or
    five months until sometime in  2012  when  the  college's  licence  was
    revoked.  Thereafter he was given 60 days to find  a  new  college  and
    submit a new CAS issued by the International School of Business Studies
    on 23 January 2013 for a course leading to a Higher National Diploma in
    Business.  The course was to end on 25  July  2014.   He  was  able  to
    pursue this course for a short  period  of  time  using  his  biometric
    letter from the Home Office as proof of his application.  However, this
    was short-lived and he was unable to attend further classes as of March
    2013.


7.   The appellant accepted that the bank statement he  had  submitted  with
    his application was "weak".  When I asked him to explain what he  meant
    by "weak" he said that the bank statement did not have  much  money  in
    it.  When I told him that he was required to show that  he  had  �1,600
    over a 28 day consecutive period, he said that because he did not  have
    the required level of funds, he had asked his mother for money.  He put
    the money in his account and submitted the bank statement to  the  Home
    Office.  However, that bank statement showed that  he  had  �1,600  for
    only one day.

8.   In view of the appellant's own admission that he did  not  have  �1,600
    in his bank account over a period of 28 consecutive days, I found  that
    his appeal could not succeed.

9.   Whilst I find that the judge did not have  the  appellant's  bundle  of
    documentary evidence before him, the bundle of documents would not have
    made a material difference to his decision.

10.  Accordingly I find that the judge did not err in law in dismissing  the
    appellant's appeal.  The judge's decision shall stand.
