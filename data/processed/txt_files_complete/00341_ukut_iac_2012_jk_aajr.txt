                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS
Introduction

   1. In these proceedings the claimant (whom we shall  refer  to  as  "JK")
      challenges an age assessment carried out on behalf  of  the  defendant
      and served upon him dated 21st July 2011 whereby it was concluded that
      his date of birth was 1st  December  1991.  JK  contends  that  he  is
      younger than he has been assessed to be by  the  defendant,  insisting
      that his date of birth is 1st December 1994. The month adopted by  the
      defendant is a result of JK being recorded in an age assessment report
      by Kent social services dated 7th November 2008 as  having  said  that
      his father told him that he was aged 13 years and four months when  he
      travelled from Pakistan to Afghanistan which was a few days before  he
      had left Afghanistan for the UK; he is recorded as having said it took
      him 10 months to travel to the UK.  He  arrived  in  the  UK  on  16th
      October 2008. He was therefore allocated a nominal day  and  month  of
      birth of 1st December.


   2. It is common ground and agreed between the parties that JK was a child
      on arrival in the United Kingdom  on  16th  October  2008;  given  the
      allocated day and month of birth of 1st December JK saying that he was
      born in 1994 and thus 13 years and 10 months  old  but  the  defendant
      asserting that he was then 16 years and 10 months with a year of birth
      of 1991.

The claimant's account

   3. JK is a citizen of Afghanistan. He was  born  and  lived  in  a  rural
      village in Nangrahar Province with his parents and three  siblings  (2
      brothers and a sister) until he was four years old. He  had  an  older
      brother  (the  first  born),  Gul  Hashim,  who  was,   according   to
      information recorded in the applicant's first witness statement  dated
      22nd January 2009 ("WS1"), killed before he  was  born  because  of  a
      land/family dispute although in his witness statement dated  10th  May
      2011 prepared for his appeal to the  First-tier  Tribunal  ("WS2")  he
      states this was incorrectly recorded and that he did not know when his
      brother was killed or the date of the incident that led to his  death.
      The next born, Hamayun remains in Afghanistan with his wife, child and
      JK's parents. Mohammed Osman, the next  born,  is  in  the  UK  having
      arrived here on 19th November  2007;  he  has  been  recognised  as  a
      refugee on the basis of the land/family dispute. The applicant's claim
      is based on the same facts. JK is the next born and there is a younger
      sister.  The  family  fled  to  Pakistan  as  a  consequence  of   the
      land/family dispute where they  remained  living  in  various  refugee
      camps until returning to Afghanistan in the first few months of 2008.


   4. JK was initially granted discretionary leave to remain until 1st  June
      2009; his immigration status  document,  issued  on  5th  March  2009,
      records  his  date  of  birth  as  01  December  1991  and,  for  some
      inexplicable reason records his place of birth  as  Pakistan  but  his
      nationality as Afghan. He used this document to apply  for  an  Afghan
      passport, to enable him to open a bank account, which  was  issued  in
      London on 29th May 2009 and also  records  a  date  of  birth  as  1st
      December 1991 (in western characters, not Pushtu)  and  his  place  of
      birth in both western characters and Pushtu.  JK  said  the  date  and
      place of  birth  were  taken  from  his  Immigration  Status  Document
      although he had told the Afghan authorities his date of birth was  1st
      December 1994 and that he had been born in Afghanistan.

   5. He applied to vary his leave, such application being rejected  by  the
      UKBA for reasons set out in a letter dated 29th March 2011. His appeal
      against that  decision  was  successful  for  reasons  set  out  in  a
      determination of the First-tier Tribunal (FtT) promulgated on 4th July
      2011. He was recognised as a refugee and issued  with  an  Immigration
      Status Document which recorded his date of birth as 01  December  1994
      which again gave his place of birth as Pakistan but his nationality as
      Afghan.

   History of Proceedings


   6. There have been three age assessments in respect of JK. The first  age
      assessment was carried out on 7th November 2008 by Kent County Council
      ("the Kent assessment"), an earlier attempt on 29th October 2008 being
      abandoned because the claimant had a cold. That  assessment  concluded
      that the  claimant's  date  of  birth  was  1  December  1991  in  the
      chronology but as "a likely 16 year old  with  an  estimated  date  of
      birth of 01/12/92" in the outcome. It seems that the actual date used,
      and referred to in the proceedings before us, was 1 December 1991  and
      throughout these proceedings we have taken that as the allocated  date
      of birth which is the subject of this challenge.

   7. The second age  assessment,  commissioned  by  the  claimant's  former
      representatives, was conducted by Dr Michie. That report,  dated  13th
      February 2009, concluded that it was more likely than not that JK  had
      a chronological age of 17 years; that it  was  possible  that  he  was
      either 16 or 18 and that it was highly unlikely that he was either  15
      or 19 years old.

   8. The third age assessment was carried out by Nottingham City Council on
      21st July 2011("the Nottingham assessment"); it concluded that he  was
      19 with an estimated date of birth of 1/12/91. By  letter  dated  27th
      April 2012 the defendant's solicitors stated they were "... instructed
      to formally withdraw the age assessment which the Council undertook on
      21st July 2011". In its Amended Detailed  Grounds  of  Resistance  the
      defendant stated "The Nottingham Assessment is no longer relied  upon"
      (paragraph 21). In its skeleton argument  the  defendant  "...withdrew
      its own assessment" (paragraph 6). The assessment was  in  the  bundle
      before us. There were no questions asked with regard to  the  material
      recorded in that assessment.


   9. Before HH Judge Davis QC, the Recorder of Birmingham, it was  accepted
      by the Defendant that it was  arguable  that  the  assessment  of  the
      claimant's age notified to him by letter dated  2nd  August  2011  was
      wrong. Permission was granted on 6th January 2012 and the  proceedings
      transferred to the Upper Tribunal.

  10. The matter came before us to carry out the fact finding exercise  that
      is required. We reserved our decision which we now give with reasons.

   The hearing

  11. The court set up was not ideal to hear evidence from  a  young  person
      but following discussion with  both  parties  arrangements  were  made
      which were to the satisfaction of Mr Suterwalla and the claimant.


  12. We heard oral evidence from the claimant and  his  brother  through  a
      Pushtu interpreter. We  heard  oral  submissions  from  both  counsel,
      supplemented on the part  of  JK's  counsel  with  typed  submissions.
      Witness statements of the social workers involved in either of the age
      assessments were not filed and none gave oral evidence. There were  no
      contemporaneous  notes  taken  at  the  time  of  the  assessments  in
      evidence. Dr Michie did not file a witness statement and did not  give
      oral evidence.

  13. During the course of JK's oral evidence it was drawn to our  attention
      that the interpreter had not been interpreting the claimant's  answers
      with strict accuracy. This arose over the Pushtu word  for  "ask"  and
      "tell" being either the same or similar. Instead of explaining this or
      interpreting the word in the context of the response, he had used  one
      or  the  other  without  explanation.  When  raised  the   interpreter
      explained that this arose because of the manner in which the  claimant
      was speaking of his  conversation  with  his  brother  which  embodied
      matters of respect from a younger to an older person. A further matter
      was raised about the interpreter failing to interpret "approximately".
      Once clarified, the interpreter confirmed that interpretation would be
      accurate and exact; there were no additional difficulties raised.

   The legal framework


  14. Given that it is agreed and common ground between the parties that the
      legal framework applicable to our assessment is clear and  settled,  a
      jointly adopted position with which we agree, it is not necessary  for
      us to carry out an extensive analysis of the authorities. In R (CJ)  v
      Cardiff City Council [2011] EWCA Civ 1590 Pitchford LJ observed that :


           1. In R (A and M) v Croydon and Lambert Borough Councils  [2009]
              UKSC 8, [2009] I WLR 2557,  the  Supreme  Court  settled  the
              question whether, in the event of a challenge to the decision
              of a local authority as to the claimant's age, the High Court
              was required either to reach  its  own  decision  as  to  the
              claimant's age or, alternatively, the challenge was by way of
              review of the  local  authority's  assessment  on  Wednesbury
              principles alone. Baroness Hale  gave  the  leading  judgment
              with which the other members of the Supreme Court agreed.  At
              paragraphs 26 and 27 Baroness Hale explained  the  difference
              in approach required for the evaluative  judgment  whether  a
              child was "in need" within the mean of section 20 of the 1989
              Act and the decision upon  the  precedent  question  of  fact
              whether the individual concerned was a child. She said this:
                 "26.  ...  the  1989  Act  draws  a  clear   and   sensible
                 distinction  between  different  kinds  of  question.   The
                 question whether a child is "in need" requires a number  of
                 different value judgments ... but where the  issue  is  not
                 what order the court should make but  what  service  should
                 the local authority provide it is  entirely  reasonable  to
                 assume that Parliament intended such  evaluative  questions
                 to be determined by the Public Authority,  subject  to  the
                 control  of  the  courts  on  the  ordinary  principles  of
                 judicial review. Within the  limits  of  fair  process  and
                 "Wednesbury reasonableness" there are no clear-cut right or
                 wrong answers.
                 27. But the question whether a person is  a  "child"  is  a
                 different kind of question. There is a  right  or  a  wrong
                 answer. It may be difficult to determine what  that  answer
                 is. The decision-makers may have to do their  best  on  the
                 basis of less than perfect or conclusive evidence but  that
                 is true of many questions  of  fact  which  regularly  come
                 before the courts. That does not prevent  them  from  being
                 questions for the courts rather than  for  other  kinds  of
                 decision-makers."
           Lord Hope, in his concurring judgment, said at paragraph 51:
                 "51. It seems to me that the  question  whether  or  not  a
                 person is a child for the purposes of  section  20  of  the
                 1989 Act is a question of fact  which  must  ultimately  be
                 decided by the court. There is no denying the  difficulties
                 that the social worker is likely to face in carrying out an
                 assessment of the question whether an unaccompanied  asylum
                 seeker  is  or  is  not  under  the  age  of  18.  Reliable
                 documentary evidence  is  almost  always  lacking  in  such
                 cases. So the process has to be  one  of  assessment.  This
                 involves the  application  of  judgment  on  a  variety  of
                 factors, as Stanley Burnton J recognised in R (B) v  Merton
                 London Borough Council [2003] 4 All ER 280,  para  37.  But
                 the question is not whether  the  person  can  properly  be
                 described as a child. Section 105 (1) of the Act  provides:
                 "in this Act ... 'child' means, subject to paragraph 16  of
                 Schedule 1, a person under the age of 18". The question  is
                 whether the person is, or is not,  under  the  age  of  18.
                 However difficult it may be to resolve the issue, it admits
                 of only one answer. As it is a question of fact, ultimately
                 this must be a matter for the court."
   Preliminary issue


  15. In opening, Mr Suterwalla invited the Tribunal to proceed on the basis
      that either there was  no  cross  examination  of  JK  or  that  cross
      examination was restricted to pre-agreed topics because:


                 i. No questions could be asked about what may  or  may  not
                    have been said by JK during  the  Nottingham  assessment
                    because  the  defendant  does   not   rely   upon   that
                    assessment;
                ii. The defendant  does  not  intend  to  call  the   social
                    workers involved in the Kent assessment so there can  be
                    little utility in questions being asked;
               iii. It was not understood how there could be any questioning
                    about JK's Taskera.



  16. He relied upon R(R) v LB Croydon [2011] EWHC 1473 paragraph 56  and  R
      (on the application of KN)  v  Barnet  [2011]  EWHC  2019  (Admin)  in
      support of this contention. Mr Suterwalla accepted that the  defendant
      was entitled to ask questions about the evidence but in the absence of
      the authors of that evidence  this  would  be  of  little  effect.  He
      submitted  that  being  unable  to  subject  the  authors   to   cross
      examination resulted in an inequality adverse to the claimant.


  17. Mr Kimblin submitted that these were matters of weight  to  be  placed
      upon the various pieces of evidence, the content was important and  it
      was open to the claimant to explain why a  particular  assessment  was
      fair or unfair.

  18. We were not satisfied there should be a direction that Mr Kimblin  not
      ask questions as to the Kent assessment or that his questioning should
      be constrained. In neither of the  two  authorities  referred  to  was
      there any support  for  the  proposition  that  there  should  be  any
      constraint imposed; the passages in effect referred to the  assessment
      of weight to be placed upon evidence before the judge. It is  a  basic
      principle that it is up to the parties to decide  what  evidence  they
      wish to call and both parties are entitled to ask questions about  the
      evidence in issue. We are not satisfied any inequality arises. It is a
      matter for us to decide what to make of  the  answers  given  and  how
      those answers impact upon  the  documentary  evidence  before  us.  We
      declined to make the direction requested.


   The evidence


  19. The claimant, as well as raising general criticisms of  the  Kent  age
      assessment and Dr Michie's assessment, relies upon:


        a. His own evidence,
        b. The evidence of his brother, Mohammed,
        c. His Taskera, and
        d. The FtT determination.


      The defendant, in support of its case that it has  correctly  assessed
      the complainant's  age,  relies  upon  the  Kent  age  assessment,  Dr
      Michie's assessment and the  record  of  what  the  claimant  said  as
      recorded in the Nottingham assessment (although not the conclusion).


  20. In the following paragraphs in addition to recording the  evidence  we
      have recorded our  findings.  Although  the  findings  occur  in  each
      section, in  reaching  those  findings  we  have  considered  all  the
      evidence, not merely that recorded in that section.  This  method  has
      been adopted for ease of reference only and does not reflect a finding
      based solely on the evidence recorded in that section.



   The evidence of the claimant


  21. JK gave lengthy oral evidence before us but, as we  shall  see,  there
      are very considerable difficulties with that evidence which  makes  it
      hard to rely upon. In assessing that evidence we took full account  of
      the fact that although his age was disputed he remains young  and  the
      giving of oral evidence  can  be  a  stressful  experience  which  may
      sometimes affect the quality of evidence given. He had no  responsible
      adult with him during the Tribunal proceedings; when raised by us with
      Mr Suterwalla he responded that between him, his instructing solicitor
      and the Tribunal he was satisfied adequate safeguards  were  in  place
      and a responsible adult was not required. He commented  that  although
      the claimant's brother was not  in  the  hearing  room,  he  was  just
      outside.


  22. No special measures were adopted in response to  this  other  than  us
      moving closer to the well of the court.  None  were  requested  by  Mr
      Suterwalla or JK or his brother during the course of the  hearing  and
      no other arrangements appeared to us to become  necessary  during  the
      course of the hearing.


  23. JK has set out his account of events and what he wishes to  say  about
      his likely age on a number of occasions:


        a. SEF self completion dated 22nd January 2009, completed with  the
           assistance of the Refugee Legal Centre and read back to him in a
           language he understands ("SEF s/c" found at tab 18)
        b. A witness statement read to him in Pashtu,  signed  by  him  and
           dated 22nd January 2009 prepared with the assistance of  Refugee
           Legal Centre ("WS1" found at tab 23);
        c. Interview record on a Statement of Evidence form  -  Children  -
           which although according to a typed insert appears to have  been
           scheduled to take place on 9th December 2008 in fact took  place
           (according to the date of the signatures) on 5th March 2009; the
           claimant had someone with  him  who  was  described  both  as  a
           responsible adult and a caseworker ("SEF" found at tab 22, typed
           version at tab 43);
        d. Comments on the UKBA's reasons  for  refusal  of  asylum  letter
           dated 29th March 2011, read to him in a language he understands,
           signed by him on 10th May 2011, prepared with the assistance  of
           Paragon Law ("WS2" found at tab 34);
        e. Witness statement, signed by him on 29th November 2011, prepared
           with the assistance of his current  solicitors,  exhibiting  WS1
           and his brother Mohammed's witness statement signed on 10th  May
           2011 ("WS3" found at tab 12).
        f. In oral evidence before us, on 14th August 2012.


  24. JK says in his WS1 that he recalls living in Shamshatoo refugee  camp.
      He recalls living in other places but does not  recall  the  names  of
      those places. His statement says he left Afghanistan when he was  four
      years old.

  25. Despite being pressed at some length when giving oral evidence  before
      us, JK's oral evidence was notable for his lack of  recall  or  memory
      about almost everything he was asked, including  information  that  he
      had given in WS1 which he confirmed, in his witness  statement  signed
      on 29th November 2011 (WS3), had been read to him by a Pashto-speaking
      interpreter and that the contents of  that  statement  were  true  and
      accurate. The correction made in WS2 was not referred to. There was no
      explanation how he was able to recall that the content of WS1 was true
      and correct in November 2011, some two years after he had  signed  WS1
      but was unable to recall the  information  in  oral  evidence  despite
      having adopted WS1 as true and accurate before us.


  26. JK told us very little indeed about his life in Pakistan  and  nothing
      about his life in Afghanistan prior to moving to Pakistan although  we
      recognise that as he claimed to have been there  for  only  the  first
      four years of his life there would be virtually nothing he could  say.
      There is very little by way of a chronological  framework  that  might
      provide some reference point from which to begin a search for his true
      age.

  27. In his SEF s/c JK said he attended school in  the  Shamshatoo  refugee
      camp between 2003 and 2008; this is repeated in the accompanying  WS1:
      he attended school in Shamshatoo refugee camp from the age of 9  until
      he was 13. The Kent assessment records JK as saying  he  first  became
      aware that he was living in Shamshatoo refugee camp when he was  about
      7/8 years old; that he went to  Alhaj  Mohammad  Gul  Khan  School  in
      Shamshatoo from the age of 9 and between the ages of 4 and  9  he  was
      playing. The Kent assessment records JK as initially  saying  he  left
      school age 11, then age 13 but he didn't know the year, then  that  it
      was a few days after he left school that he went  to  Afghanistan  and
      that he went to Afghanistan when he was 13 and it was 3-4 months after
      the Pakistan New Year.  In oral evidence he said both  that  he  could
      not remember how old he was when he started school and that he was  at
      school for approximately four years and had started school aged  about
      9, that he and Mohammed attended the same school  for  some  time  but
      Mohammed was a bit older and in a higher class. He could not  remember
      what class Mohammed was in when he left Pakistan.

  28. In WS1 JK says he and his family had to leave Shamshatoo refugee  camp
      when the Pakistani authorities destroyed the camp. Although  the  camp
      was not closed, according to Dr Giustozzi (at [5] of his report  found
      at tab 37) it was raided at the time that Jalozai camp was  closed  in
      April 2008. His departure date  has  been  vague  but  the  consistent
      element was that the family left Pakistan when the camp was closed. As
      a young person a  raid  may  have  seemed  like  closure.  Arrival  in
      Afghanistan  would  then  have  been  some  time  in  April/May  2008.
      Subsequent departure after a few days would have resulted in a journey
      time in the region of 6-7 months. The evidence  as  to  when  he  left
      varied between February and August 2008 and the  explanation  he  gave
      about leaving was vague and inconsistent but  the  consistent  element
      was that he left Pakistan for Afghanistan at the time of  the  closure
      of the camp and that he left Afghanistan a  few  days  after  arriving
      there.

  29. We have therefore taken the view, allowing for  some  time  to  travel
      between the camp and Nangrahar, that he left Afghanistan in  April/May
      2008. This would mean that he spent some 6 or so months travelling  to
      the UK, again broadly consistent with  his  account  of  his  journey,
      albeit that also varied each time he recounted the detail.

  30. In WS1 JK states that his mother told him he was 13 � just  before  he
      left Afghanistan. In his SEF he says he  was  about  13  �.  The  Kent
      assessment records JK as saying that his father told  him  he  was  13
      years and four months, when he was in Afghanistan and that his  father
      had also told him he was 9 when he was attending school in Pakistan.


  31. In WS1 he also states that his father told him, after they returned to
      Afghanistan from Pakistan after  the  closure  of  Shamshatoo  refugee
      camp, that they had first left Afghanistan when he was aged 4  because
      his older brother Gul Hashim had been killed in a land/family dispute;
      he said Gul Hashim had been killed before he was born. In his  SEF  he
      said that his family had been in hiding in Afghanistan  until  he  had
      been born and after some time the family had gone  to  Pakistan.  This
      was later corrected in WS2 where he states that he did not  know  when
      Gul Hashim was killed or the date of the incident but that his  father
      had told him he was aged four when the family  left  Afghanistan.   JK
      adopted WS1 before us as true and accurate without  reference  to  the
      correction. The Kent assessment records JK as saying his  family  left
      Afghanistan because they were exposed to risk because their enemy  had
      killed his brother; it also records JK saying he didn't know why  they
      had moved to Pakistan and also that his father decided to send him  to
      Pakistan to safeguard him from his father's enemies. It  records  that
      he didn't know Gul Hashim "as it could be that he was very  young  and
      maybe not even born when he was killed". The Kent  assessment  records
      JK as saying that he and his family moved to Pakistan when he was four
      years old.

  32. In his SEF (question and answer 43) he said his brother  Mohammed  had
      left Pakistan about 15/16 months earlier. It is not clear whether this
      is 15/16 months before he himself left for  the  UK  or  15/16  months
      before the date of that statement. In the Kent assessment  when  asked
      what he would do if he was bullied he said he would tell  his  brother
      about it; he is recorded as talking fondly about his brother. The Kent
      assessment records JK as saying that his father told him that Mohammed
      was 16 when he left Afghanistan and  that  he  then  argued  that  his
      brother was 15 when he left Pakistan. In oral evidence he said that he
      had not given any particular age for Mohammed to Kent;  he  said  that
      his parents had told him while he was in Afghanistan that Mohammed was
      2 � to 3 years older than him.

  33. In his SEF s/c JK said that Hamayan was approximately  26  years  old;
      that Mohammed  was  approximately  15/16  years  old  and  his  sister
      approximately 6/7 years old. In the accompanying  statement  (WS1)  he
      refers to Hamayun and Mohammed as older brothers and  to  his  younger
      sister.

  34. In oral evidence the claimant said there  was  no  independent  person
      with him during the course of the Kent age assessment,  he  never  saw
      what was written about him and key  points  of  alleged  discrepancies
      were not put to him. He said he was told that his age was not accepted
      and that if he provided any documentation they would reconsider.  When
      asked about the record that he had said he  left  school  aged  11  he
      responded that he had initially said he did not know his age, that  he
      had started school aged about 9, and been to school for four years and
      when asked again directly said both 'yes' and 'no'. He said he had not
      given any particular age of his brother, contrary  to  the  assessment
      which states that he initially said 16 and then amended it to  15.  He
      said there had  been  some  problems  with  the  interpreter  who  had
      switched between Pashtu and Dari. He said his  parents  had  told  him
      that Mohammed was 2 � to 3 years older than him.

  35. The Taskera appears to have been received in the UK in July 2009.  The
      original was not available, the claimant's former solicitors saying it
      had been sent to the UKBA and the UKBA saying they  had  not  received
      it. JK claims that whilst in Afghanistan for a  few  days  his  father
      arranged for a photo to be taken on the basis that he would  need  ID.
      Quite why this was so given he  was  due  to  leave  Afghanistan  very
      shortly was  not  explained.  For  some  inexplicable  reason  nothing
      further happens about this until JK informs his  brother  that  social
      services did not accept his age and  wanted  some  documentation.  His
      brother contacted a friend in the UK, Obeid, who manages, whilst on  a
      trip to Afghanistan to obtain the Taskera  which  he  then  brings  to
      Mohammed who then posts it to JK.


  36.  JK's Taskera does no more than state that the named person appears to
      be aged 14. It was dated after JK claimed to have left Afghanistan but
      before he arrived in the UK.  We have not seen the  original  and  the
      photocopy of the photo is not  sufficiently  distinct  to  be  of  any
      assistance . It appears in any event that the Taskera was obtained  on
      the basis of a photo and someone saying that he "appears" to be 14. JK
      obtained an Afghan passport in May  2009,  prior  to  receipt  of  the
      Taskera. The  passport  itself  has  peculiar  entries  recording  the
      applicant as having been born in Pakistan. The Taskera was received by
      JK after the age assessment, albeit dated prior to  it.   Mohammed  in
      his oral evidence refers to the  obtaining  of  his  own  Taskera  and
      contact  with  his  father.  This  oral  evidence  was  confused   and
      contradictory and eventually Mohammed fell back on  stock  answers  of
      'don't know' and 'don't remember'. We have placed no weight on  either
      the Taskera or the passport as evidence of JK's  age:  they  have  not
      been produced independently of other evidence and the  evidence  which
      forms the basis upon which they have been produced is itself  open  to
      question.


  37. The claimant throughout his oral evidence could not  recall  dates  or
      time scales. He was unable to give  estimates  in  terms  of  days  or
      weeks. He could not recall what time of  year  it  was  that  he  left
      Afghanistan. In his oral  evidence  he  fell  back  repeatedly  on  an
      assertion that he had no knowledge of dates or ages or times, that  he
      was told by his parents that they had first left Afghanistan  when  he
      was aged about four, that he started school  aged  about  9,  that  he
      attended school for about four years, that he  left  school  aged  13,
      that he remained in Afghanistan for the second time  for  a  few  days
      only before leaving for the  UK,  that  he  only  knew  when  he  left
      Afghanistan because he heard people saying he left in the 2nd  or  3rd
      month, that it took him 8-10 months to travel to the UK  and  that  he
      had been told that Mohammed was 2 � to 3 years older than him.  It  is
      astonishing that for a  young  person  who  claims  not  to  have  any
      realisation of dates or periods of times or  seasons  (despite  coming
      from a rural area) that he retained in his memory his age having  been
      told this once on one evening even though he was not told at that time
      why he was being told this and it was not until the following  morning
      he was told he was leaving  Afghanistan,  that  he  recalled  how  old
      Hamayun was because he could remember  a  conversation  about  Hamayun
      getting married when he was 18. It is astonishing  that  despite  what
      must have been very real hardships in a  lengthy  journey  to  the  UK
      (whatever his age) he managed to recall his age,  the  age  difference
      between himself and Mohammed, what he heard during the  journey  about
      the month he left and yet on so many other  matters  relating  to  his
      life he could not remember. His recall of  ages  correlates  with  his
      brother's recall.


  38. We have placed very little weight on these claims which we consider to
      have been produced in order to substantiate his claim  that  he  is  a
      minor  of  a  particular  age  rather  than  based   upon   any   real
      recollection.

   The evidence of the claimant's brother, Mohammed

  39. When Mohamed gave evidence he was fasting and at the  start  of  cross
      examination he complained of a headache. The hearing was adjourned for
      him to re-commence his evidence the following  morning.  None  of  the
      evidence given  the  previous  day  was  significantly  re-visited  or
      changed. He relied upon a  witness  statement  originally  dated  18th
      December 2007 that he had given in support of  his  own  asylum  claim
      (his asylum statement) and his oral evidence.


  40. This asylum statement (to be found at tab 13 and tab 35) was exhibited
      to a witness statement  that  was  adopted  before  us.  He  had  also
      provided a copy for JK in his asylum appeal.   On  each  occasion  his
      asylum statement had been re-signed with the  date  on  which  it  was
      relied upon and there was confirmation that it had been read by him in
      a language he  understood.  This  meant  that  he  had  confirmed  its
      contents on three separate occasions. The asylum statement said:

        a. When he, Mohammed,  was aged about 7, his family became involved
           in a dispute with another family because his older  brother  Gul
           Hashim had become involved with a girl from that family;
        b. Gul Hashim had been killed because his family had not agreed  to
           the relinquishing of land as compensation  for  the  refusal  to
           marry the girl;
        c. The family had then relocated to Pakistan where  they  lived  as
           refugees in Kacha Gari camp, near Hayattabad until the camp  was
           closed in April 2007;
        d. He attended Hyattabad Public School until forced  to  leave  the
           camp;
        e. The family moved from place to place  until  they  ended  up  in
           Shamshatoo camp;
        f. His father then arranged for him to leave Pakistan;
        g. He arrived in the UK in November 2007 having travelled for about
           four months;
        h. Since arriving in the UK he  had  spoken  to  his  father,  such
           contact being facilitated  through  an  interpreter  who  had  a
           relative who worked with Peshawar police force who went  to  the
           camp and located his family. He states he has not spoken to  him
           since then.


  41. Immigration Judge Obhi who heard Mohammed's appeal against the refusal
      to vary his leave to remain following rejection of  his  asylum  claim
      accepted the core of his claim,  rejecting  only  that  he  no  longer
      remained in contact with his family but finding that  the  family  was
      moving from place to place.  That  latter  finding  was  clearly  made
      applying the usual low standard of proof.


  42. In oral evidence before us Mohammed said he  had  not  spoken  to  his
      father. He said he had spoken to someone who had spoken to the  police
      officer in Peshawar and that was the person he had subsequently spoken
      to. He said he had not paid much attention to  the  witness  statement
      even though he had been asked to sign it several times and had adopted
      it before us and even though he accepted  that  it  was  an  important
      document and his asylum claim had been based on its contents.

  43. During oral evidence he also said he  had  received  his  own  Taskera
      through this contact and that person had told him he had spoken to his
      father, that he had the documents and they were  sent  to  the  social
      worker. Mohammed has adopted his witness statement  three  times.  The
      Immigration judge disbelieved him as regards the issue of contact with
      his father, applying a low standard of proof.  We also do not  believe
      Mohamed's account that he has had no contact with his father.

  44. With regard to JK's Taskera he confirmed that Obeid had  obtained  it.
      He said he didn't know how he had obtained it because they didn't talk
      about it. It is simply not credible that  there  would  have  been  no
      discussion between Mohammed and Obeid as to  how  Obeid  obtained  the
      Taskera in Afghanistan.

  45. In oral evidence he initially could not remember how old he  was  when
      he left Afghanistan for Pakistan because of the feud although later in
      evidence he said it was a few days, maybe a week after his brother was
      killed.

  46. Mohammed said that he had not given a definite statement that JK was 3
      years younger than him but had said he was 2 � to 3 years younger than
      him. He said he had never given a specific age for  JK  and  that  the
      record in his asylum statement was wrong.  In his asylum  statement  -
      December 2007 - he records that JK is 12 and that Gul Hashim had  been
      killed 8 years previously. He said that he had been told his month and
      year of birth by his father before he left Pakistan and  that  he  had
      been born in August 1992. He said that information passed to him  from
      his mother and father was that the age difference between him  and  JK
      was 2 � to 3 years.

  47. Mohammed said he had  not  attended  school  in  Shamshatoo  camp.  He
      confirmed "absolutely" that he had only gone to one  school  and  that
      school was in Katcha Gari camp; the most he went to school was four or
      five years. He confirmed he and his family including  JK  left  Katcha
      Gari camp in April 2007. He could not remember  how  long  he  was  in
      Shamshatoo camp, being unable to give an estimate in  terms  of  days,
      weeks or months. Although confirming that JK  was  with  him  and  his
      family he was unable to say whether JK went to  school  in  Shamshatoo
      camp saying that he "didn't spend enough time with JK and so could not
      tell  you  whether  he  went  to  school  there".  He  said  that   JK
      "absolutely" went to school in Katcha Gari camp at the same school  as
      him.


  48. Like his brother, Mohammed was unable to recall anything in detail. He
      was evasive in his answers and fell back  repeatedly  on  a  purported
      lack of knowledge and  recall.  For  both,  the  areas  they  answered
      questions on related to their respective  ages;  virtually  everything
      else they  could  not  remember.  We  conclude  that  there  has  been
      collusion between them since the arrival in the UK  of  JK  such  that
      they have attempted to ensure their stories corroborated  each  other.
      We are satisfied that where an issue arose upon  which  they  had  not
      discussed their answers  they  responded  by  saying  they  could  not
      remember or didn't know. We do not accept that they had such a lack of
      knowledge as claimed and are satisfied that  they  have  adopted  this
      approach in order to attempt to mislead the Tribunal as to their  true
      ages. We take the view that this collusion commenced  prior  to  their
      respective arrivals in the UK and that the respective ages  they  gave
      was arranged in advance in the knowledge that once they arrived in the
      UK they would, as minors, be granted some form of permission to stay.


  49. Mr Kimblin sought to persuade us that Mohammed's age  namely  that  he
      was born in August 1992 with a nominal date of birth of the 1st August
      should be displaced in the light of the  poor  quality  oral  evidence
      before us.  In  particular  he  relied  upon  the  failure  to  answer
      questions, the claimed lack of recall, the purported lack of knowledge
      and the lack of any investigation into his claimed age. Whilst we have
      concerns about Mohammed's age we are not satisfied that there has been
      anything approaching adequate evidence produced to sustain  a  finding
      that his age should be displaced. The fact that his oral evidence  was
      almost totally lacking in credibility does not  satisfy  us  that  his
      date of birth is unreliable. This is particularly so given that he was
      age assessed by Nottinghamshire when he arrived in the UK in  November
      2007 and found to be 15, that he has been under the care of Nottingham
      social  services  since  then  and  there  has  been  no  intervention
      whatsoever to re-assess him despite, it can be assumed,  there  having
      been other professionals involved with him not least teachers,  social
      workers,   support   workers,   accommodation   workers   and   health
      professionals. Had there been any doubt that he was the age he claimed
      to be, given he has  remained  under  the  care  of  the  same  social
      services department from arrival until  now,  it  seems  inconceivable
      that steps would not  have  been  taken  to  re-assess  him.  This  is
      particularly so given the financial constraints that  social  services
      departments  are  working  under  and  the  cost  of   supporting   an
      individual.



First-tier Tribunal determination of JK (found at tab 39).

  50.  Immigration Judge McDade, in  a  short  and  succinct  determination,
      recorded that the Home Office conceded that the findings in respect of
      Mohammed particularly in  relation  to  credibility  meant  that  JK's
      account was also credible namely that he had left Afghanistan  because
      of a land dispute  and  would  be  at  risk  of  being  persecuted  if
      returned. He recorded that the Home Office continued to  dispute  JK's
      age, asserting that JK was not the age  he  claimed  (16  at  the  FtT
      hearing) but 19. The determination then proceeded to  attack  the  age
      assessment undertaken by Kent social services. He concluded that:


        a. It was inconceivable that JK was born in 1991;
        b. That having seen JK and Mohammed he had no doubt but that JK was
           younger than his brother;
        c. That given the credibility of Mohammed and JK had been  accepted
           in all other respects it made no sense for Mohammed to claim  he
           had left a younger brother in Afghanistan and for  JK  to  claim
           his older brother had already left if that were not true;
        d. That the Kent social services report was shoddy and could not be
           relied upon.


  51.  Mr Suterwalla submitted that the FtT determination in JK  found  that
      the core evidence of both brothers was credible. He submitted that  in
      assessing the weight to be placed upon this  determination  we  should
      consider the reasoning and process by which the decision was  reached,
      as referred to in R (PM) v Hertfordshire CC [2011] PTSR 269  at  [83].
      He submitted that the  findings  as  to  consistency  and  credibility
      should carry significant weight and that to find that JK was  born  in
      1991 would be perverse. Unfortunately the  reasoning  employed  by  IJ
      McDade was based upon the false premise that the Kent  age  assessment
      consisted of the front page only. Although we accept that  there  were
      significant deficiencies in the  Kent  assessment  (as  to  which  see
      below)  we  do  not  accept  that  they  are  such  that  IJ  McDade's
      conclusions outweigh them or carry more weight, in so far  as  age  is
      concerned. We do however accept IJ McDade's comment  that  of  JK  and
      Mohammed, JK is the younger both from his  assessment  of  their  core
      account and from his observations of seeing them and hearing them give
      evidence.


  52. We do not however accept  that  any  reliance  can  be  placed  on  IJ
      McDade's findings as to JK's age. It may well be that the core account
      of the basis of the claim for asylum  made  by  the  two  brothers  is
      consistent however that cannot be said about the evidence with  regard
      to their age. The most that can be  said  about  their  evidence  with
      regard to their ages is that JK is younger than Mohammed.


  53. We also find independent support for this conclusion namely:

        a.  the comments in the Kent assessment that JK  talked  fondly  of
           his brother and, rather inadvertently,
        b. during the discussion with the interpreter about interpretation,
           the interpreter said that JK was using respectful language  when
           responding to questions of how he informed his brother about the
           outcome of his age assessment;
        c. that when asked how he would respond  to  bullying  he  said  he
           would tell his brother;

     Assessment report (found at Tab 14)

  54. The assessment report appears to have been undertaken by Sylvia Harris
      who is described as duty  social  worker  and  Karen  Higgins  who  is
      described as a support worker. There is no  evidence,  either  in  the
      report or separately, as to their  experience  or  expertise.  On  the
      front page the box saying "child seen alone Yes/no and Date(s)" is not
      completed but alongside that are the words No  interpreter  present  -
      Hamed Ghafari. The professionals involved with the claimant are listed
      as Ms Harris, Ms  Higgins,  Andrea  Laverty  (Family  Support  Worker)
      although she is not recorded as having contributed to the  assessment,
      DASC (designated as 'Immigration' although  no  other  explanation  is
      given)  who  contributed  to  the   assessment,   Minority   Community
      Achievement designated as Education who  did  not  contribute  to  the
      assessment,  Hamed  Ghafari  (interpreter)  who  contributed  to   the
      assessment and Appledore Reception Centre (residential home staff) who
      contributed to the assessment. The box identifying  whether  a  report
      from each of these is attached is not completed.  The report  has  not
      been signed by any of the individuals participating in the  assessment
      but has been signed by Janette Narramore  who  is  noted  as  being  a
      Manager and having agreed it.


  55. There are quotes in the report from the Appledore  staff  but  records
      made by the staff on daily interaction or  issues  that  arose  during
      their periods of dealing with JK are not attached.

  56. There is no explanation given why the Family Support  worker  has  not
      been consulted or why those involved  with  JK's  education  were  not
      consulted. Nor is there any explanation why the record says  there  is
      no interpreter but the body of the report refers to JK making  no  eye
      contact with the interpreter or why or how that is  relevant  to  this
      age assessment. There was no independent person present or responsible
      adult. There was no indication that the report was read to JK or  that
      he was asked to comment on  alleged  discrepancies  or  contradictions
      (although the form states it is "(To include the Child's  views  shown
      in Italics)"). There is no record of the interview in a  question  and
      answer format, no contemporaneous notes and  it  is  not  possible  to
      establish when the report was written - the signature of  the  manager
      is dated 1/12/91. JK is recorded as having arrived in the UK at  Dover
      on 17/06/08 whereas he arrived on 16/10/08 and was  referred  to  Kent
      social services on 16/10/08. Despite being  informed  that  JK  had  a
      brother in the UK who had been recognised as a refugee and appeared on
      what JK was saying to be under  18  there  appears  to  have  been  no
      attempt to speak with him or social workers involved with him in order
      to inform the consideration of JK's family structure.

  57. The (unidentified) writer of the report says:

           "When the writer first saw  J...,  he  had  a  bigger  face  and
           stronger jaw line. J...seem [sic] to have lost some  weight  and
           his face now looks slimmer, although his jaw line remained  very
           defined and well structured."


      The report refers to an abandoned assessment 9 days previously.  There
      is no record of JK having been weighed at either assessment. There  is
      no record of any investigation by the social worker about what appears
      to have been a surprising loss of weight such that it  showed  in  his
      face over a period of only nine days


  58. The assessment has what appears to be an attempt  at  coming  to  some
      sort of reasoned assessment of family ages but it is incomprehensible:


           "The writer assumes that his brother could be less than 10 years
           old when he was killed as the reason for the family to  move  to
           Pakistan is to escape their enemy as one of their  children  has
           been killed. J...also said he left Afghanistan for Pakistan when
           he as  [sic]  four  years  old.  J...could  not  give  any  more
           information about his deceased brother and  repeatedly  said  he
           was very young and does not know him. Bearing in mind  that  J's
           2nd in line sibling (Hamayun) is 24/26 then his deceased brother
           (Gul Hashim) could have been about 26/27. My hypothesis to  this
           is that as the family moved because of this  incident  and  left
           nine years later it is highly likely that Gul Hasim  was  killed
           when he was 17/18 years old."


  59.  There are contradictory records of information provided by JK  as  to
      why the family moved to Pakistan. It is  not  clear  whether  this  is
      because JK  changed  his  account  or  whether  information  has  been
      inaccurately transposed between sections; there is no  record  of  the
      questions asked and no contemporaneous notes.


  60.  The assessment concludes, for some unstated reason:


           "...it is the view of the assessing social  worker  that  J...is
           between the age of 17 to 21 and was given the benefit  of  doubt
           and assessed as a sixteen year old with  an  estimated  date  of
           birth of 01/12/91."


   Other Kent records


  61. There is reference in the First looked After Child Review held on 11th
      November 2008 - 4 days after the assessment - that Ms Higgins "felt he
      had lost weight since she last saw him". Again, and perhaps even  more
      surprisingly, there seems to have been  no  further  investigation  or
      questioning given that JK appears to have lost noticeable weight  over
      a very short period of time. This review records Ms Higgins as stating
      that the Duty and Assessment  Team  would  not  be  facilitating  JK's
      reunification with his brother  but  being  told  by  the  Independent
      Reviewing Officer that she would  "need  to  ascertain  the  brother's
      details and contact the local Social Service  in  discussing  possible
      reunification..."


  62. A record of an Initial Key Worker meeting  records  that  he  says  he
      "attended a good school in Nagahar Province.  This  was  when  J...was
      between the ages of nine and thirteen years. He studied  English  [two
      years], Pashto, Dari, maths and the Quran." The report goes on to  say
      he has had an  educational  assessment  and  says  refer  to  separate
      report. That report was not in the papers before us. No point on  this
      apparent discrepancy in JK's evidence as to where he  went  to  school
      was  taken  before  us  and  we  have  therefore  treated  it   as   a
      transcription error. It is unfortunate that the educational assessment
      was not before us given that this could well have provided  assistance
      in assessing JK's claimed educational history and could have  been  of
      assistance in our assessment of his age.


  63.  The  Kent  age  assessment  was  not  conducted  in  accordance  with
      recognised guidelines; although JK's oral evidence with regard to this
      assessment was itself confused and lacked consistency this perhaps did
      no more than to confirm the lack of rigour of the report. It may  well
      be that in addition to dissembling and collusion, JK is young and thus
      his questioning, the record of his answers and  the  approach  adopted
      should have considered  that  more  carefully  particularly  give  his
      claimed harsh journey. The lack of much expertise  of  the  conducting
      social worker is indicated by the report of the Independent  Reviewing
      Officer who had to instruct her to make enquiries about JK's  brother,
      a matter that seems self evident given that JK had been assessed as 16
      and thus a juvenile but with an older brother in the  UK.  Furthermore
      several parts of  the  report  are  unintelligible  and  there  is  no
      explanation whatsoever of how the assessment came to an allocated  age
      of 16 other than a totally unexplained grant of the  'benefit  of  the
      doubt'.


  64. Mr Suterwalla urged us to place no weight  upon  the  content  of  the
      report due to the failure of the respondent to call the writer to give
      oral evidence and the lack of indications as to expertise. The  report
      was written some four years ago; there were no  contemporaneous  notes
      and no tape recording of the interview. We  doubt  that  even  if  the
      social worker had been called to give oral  evidence  she  would  have
      been able to say anything more than was recorded  in  the  assessment;
      anything she had said would have been relying on memories  four  years
      old during which time it seems safe to assume a number of young people
      have passed through her care. We do however consider that the lack  of
      witness statement, either from her or a manager, as to  her  expertise
      and training undertaken by the time she conducted the report is remiss
      and reduces the weight that can be placed  upon  the  content  of  the
      report, given that we have no real idea what expertise she brought  to
      the task. We do not consider that merely being described as the writer
      entitles her report to be treated  as  expert  evidence  or  that  the
      report is in some way professional. We  do  not  however  dismiss  the
      content of the report  completely  but  in  considering  the  recorded
      information we have taken account of the  inconsistencies  within  the
      report itself, the lack of explanation for those inconsistencies,  the
      failure to put any inconsistencies to  JK  and  the  seeming  lack  of
      experience of the social worker.


  65. One record that seems consistent with evidence from the other  sources
      before us that JK went to school for four years and was aged 9 when he
      started school.


   Nottingham


   Nottingham assessment (Found at tab 15)


  66.  JK was not asked any questions about the Nottingham  age  assessment.
      Mr Kimblin made no submissions with regard to this report  other  than
      to request that we read it. We have noted that it  was  undertaken  by
      one social worker whose claimed expertise was not before us, there was
      no independent adult present and none of the recorded areas of concern
      or contradictions were put to JK, He was  not  given  a  copy  of  the
      assessment.  There  was  no  record  of  the  social  worker   seeking
      information about JK from other individuals who had had  contact  with
      him including through education and health and his brother.  There  is
      no  indication  that  JK's  brother  was  interviewed  or  information
      obtained from his (Nottingham) social services file.


   Other Nottingham documents




  67. 3 redacted sheets headed "Observations  recorded  between  04-Jan-2010
      and  04-Apr-2012  set  out  14  notifications  between  22/06/11   and
      03/04/12. These appear to be notes of incidents recorded by Nottingham
      social services; there is nothing of note in these records save for  a
      summarised conclusion by Mr Liv Brown that JK is aged  about  19.  Our
      attention was not drawn to any specific issue in these sheets.


  68. A form dated 5th July 2007 records that JK has been in the care of the
      local authority since arriving in the UK. The social services  records
      relating to that care, whether from Kent or from Nottingham  were  not
      produced to us. Although he is recorded as studying in the UK, none of
      his education records were in  the  papers  before  us  nor  were  any
      medical records.


  69. In closing submissions Mr Kimblin stated that he wished us to read  it
      because it contained a record of what was discussed between JK and the
      social worker but that the conclusion was not relied upon. He said the
      document was in evidence but accepted that the content  had  not  been
      put to him and that would affect the weight we could place upon it.


  70. The defendant's position as regards the Nottingham age assessment  was
      rather confusing. Correspondence indicates clearly that  it  has  been
      withdrawn; there is also reference to it not being relied upon yet  in
      submissions Mr Kimblin stated that he wished us to  read  it  for  the
      record of what had been said between JK and the  social  worker.  With
      respect to Mr Kimblin we do not accept that the report can be taken as
      a record of what transpired in the assessment - nothing in the  report
      was put to JK and it was not read back to him. There  is  no  question
      and answer record and none of the content was put  to  JK  before  us.
      There is no indication of the expertise  of  the  interviewing  social
      worker. We have therefore disregarded the Nottingham  age  assessment.
      In so far as the redacted reports are concerned these add  nothing  to
      our understanding of JK's age.


   Dr Michie's report (to be found at tab 16)

  71. Dr Michie interviewed JK during one afternoon in February 2009. He did
      not consider JK's medical, education or social work  records.  He  did
      not interview JK's brother. The report is general and it is not at all
      clear how he reaches his conclusion that JK was aged  17  in  February
      2009 with a possible deviation of 2 years. There was no follow  up  to
      the report.


  72. Dr Michie's reports have been seriously criticised in other courts for
      their lack of explanation of statistical methodology  and  failure  to
      retain notes of interviews and observations. We note that  there  were
      no notes or observations produced to us and Dr  Michie  did  not  give
      oral evidence and nor was there a witness statement from him. We  find
      his report to be uninformative and of no assistance to us in  reaching
      our decision. Although it records an account of JK's claim it  is  not
      possible from that account as written to establish what  was  said  by
      JK, what was surmised by Dr Michie or how the information was obtained
      or tested. We have placed no weight upon the report.


Closing submissions

  73. We do not need to set out, in detail, the helpful closing  submissions
      advanced by Mr Suterwalla and Mr Kimblin; we  have  taken  those  into
      account as we have assessed the evidence and had regard  to  all  that
      has been said, both in the opening  submissions,  skeleton  arguments,
      typed  submissions  and  in  closing  submissions,  whether  we   have
      specifically referred to the points made or not.

Conclusions


  74. The  evidence  the  parties  have  placed  before  us  has  been  most
      unsatisfactory, incomplete and of very little assistance.


  75.  Mohammed's asylum claim in the UK was initially rejected but, after a
      successful appeal on 19th May  2008  to  the  Asylum  and  Immigration
      Tribunal he was recognised as a refugee. Mohammed  was  initially  age
      disputed by the UKBA but, after an age assessment by  Nottingham  City
      Council, it was accepted that he was the age he  claimed  and  he  was
      allocated a nominal date of birth of 1st August 1992. On  his  arrival
      in the UK Mohammed was, therefore, on his claimed and accepted date of
      birth, aged 15 years and 3 months, before the AIT he was 15 years  and
      9 months and before us  aged  20.   Mohammed  is  now  unemployed.  In
      accordance with the Regulations and Guidance related to  the  Children
      (Leaving Care) Act 2000 it appears to us that he  continues  to  be  a
      former relevant child because he is 20 (s23 Children Act 1989). A copy
      of his age assessment and his social services file was not produced to
      us. Despite this and given his allocated and assessed age  and  social
      services involvement with Mohammed there has been no re-assessment .We
      consider Mohammed's age pursuant to submissions by both parties.  This
      is clearly significant  because  both  JK  and  Mohammed  have  always
      asserted that JK is younger than Mohammed,  the  age  gap  varying  at
      different times to between 2 � and 3 years.


  76. Although we have doubts as to his age, we have neither heard nor  seen
      evidence sufficient  to  displace  the  age  he  has  been  allocated,
      particularly given the lack of any challenge to his age by those  with
      care and involvement with him over a number of years.


  77. We have therefore taken as our starting point  Mohammed's  age  namely
      that he was born on 1st August 1992 and that JK is younger  than  him.
      As identified by Mr Suterwalla, the earliest that JK could  have  been
      born was May 1993.


  78. Although there has been some variation in the length of time he  spent
      in various countries, we are very aware that the journey for  a  young
      person would have been very harsh. There has been  no  substantial  or
      significant objection to the claim that the journey would  have  taken
      several months. There is no doubt of the date he arrived in the UK. We
      have taken the view that he left Afghanistan in April/May 2008.


  79. Although there have been divergence and contradictions in the evidence
      there are some matters that  appear  relatively  consistent.  This  is
      particularly so when considered in the context  of  Mohamed  being  15
      when he arrived in the UK and  JK  being  younger  than  him.  Clearly
      memories fade and, particularly with young  people  facing  challenges
      and change,  issues  that  are  not  particularly  relevant  to  their
      continuing day to day life seem  less  important  and  are  thus  less
      subject to recall. We are also aware that in many cases respect  given
      to older individuals and particularly parents may result in  decisions
      being taken for which no explanation is given or sought. That  is  not
      to minimise what we have said earlier  about  the  apparent  collusion
      between JK, his brother and his family but there are some core matters
      where the evidence before us does appear broadly compatible  with  and
      of itself:

        a. Both JK and Mohammed appear to have  gone  to  school  for  four
           years and they attended school together.
        b. The raid on Shamshatoo refugee  camp  can  be  seen  as  broadly
           compatible with the family exodus back to  Afghanistan  and  the
           subsequent quick departure of JK to the UK.  We  do  not  accept
           that JK did not know the month he left Afghanistan when he  left
           but we are prepared to accept that his memory  of  that  may  be
           vague given  the  harshness  of  the  journey  to  the  UK.  The
           insistence during the various interviews he has  had  could,  we
           appreciate have led to an attempt by him  to  'come  up  with  a
           month' that satisfied his questioners and tied in with  that  an
           approximate estimate of the length of his journey.
        c. Mohammed  was  adamant  that  he  had  not  gone  to  school  in
           Shamshatoo and that the family had moved to Shamshatoo in  April
           2007. Mohammed had taken in the region of four months to  travel
           to the UK and had arrived in November 2007;  he  had  thus  left
           Shamshatoo around July/August 2007. We do  not  accept  that  he
           would have been unaware whether JK went to school in Shamshatoo.
        d. Mohammed was born on 1st August 1992.


  80. We do not accept that JK was told he was 13 or 13 years 4 months or 13
      and a half the day before he left  Afghanistan.  This  is  not  solely
      because his account differed as to whether it was his mother or father
      or both parents told him but principally because the circumstances  he
      described when he was told which led to him being able to recall  this
      information are not credible.  We have disregarded JK's assertion that
      he was aged 13 plus a few months when he left Afghanistan.


  81. The evidence that he gave that he left Afghanistan for the first  time
      when aged four, that Mohammed gave  evidence  that  he  left  when  he
      (Mohammed) was 7, that Mohammed said that Gul Hashim had died 8  years
      before he (Mohammed) arrived in the UK, that JK said  (amongst  albeit
      contradictory evidence) that Gul  Hashim  had  died  just  before  the
      family left Afghanistan of  Pakistan  and  that  JK  is  younger  than
      Mohamed does tend towards some consistency in establishing age but for
      reasons we refer to below in [83] we do  have  disregarded  the  claim
      that JK was 4 when he initially left Afghanistan.


  82. There is  a  significant  discrepancy  about  schooling:  Mohammed  is
      adamant he only went to school in Katcha Gari, that he attended school
      for 4-5 years and that JK attended school for part of that  time;  and
      JK's evidence is that he went to school in Shamshatoo for 4 years  and
      Mohammed was there for part of the time. It may  be  that  JK  recalls
      being at the same school but is mistaken as to the whereabouts of  the
      school. It seems that Mohammed started school round about the age of 8
      although on his evidence the family would only have been at Shamshatoo
      for a few months before he left (despite his claimed inability to give
      even a rough estimate of the length of time he spent there) - not  the
      four years claimed by JK.

  83. This evidence is difficult to reconcile particularly because  we  take
      the view that both JK and his brother  were  deliberately  dissembling
      and that both he and JK were able to recall more information than they
      were prepared  to  disclose.  We  tend  towards  accepting  Mohammed's
      evidence that he was at a school in Katcha Gari  for  four  years  and
      thus the family and JK were in Shamshatoo for only about a year before
      returning to Afghanistan. The high point of JK's evidence is  that  he
      left Afghanistan when he was young, lived in various  camps  including
      Shamshatoo; that he had about four years schooling and  that  he  left
      Afghanistan in April 2008. We do not accept his or Mohammed's evidence
      that JK initially left Afghanistan when he was four  years  old.  This
      evidence is, we are satisfied, a result of collusion - JK  would  have
      no independent recollection of his age and would only have given  this
      age as a result of what he was told; we are firmly of the belief  that
      the information he gave was in order to bolster a claim that he was  a
      minor.



  84. Mohammed's evidence has been that he left Afghanistan  age  7.  Taking
      his date of birth as 1st August 1992 for the reasons set out above  we
      have taken this date of departure to be at a time when Mohammed was in
      the middle of his seventh year; by that time he  would  be  describing
      himself as 7 and not nearly 8. We have therefore  concluded  that  the
      family left Afghanistan in  or  about  February  2000  at  which  time
      Mohammed would have been 7 years old.

  85. This fits with Mohammed's evidence in December 2007 that  his  brother
      Gul Hashim had been killed 8 years ago. This could however either mean
      that Gul Hashim died in December 1999 (8  years  before  he  gave  his
      statement) or February 2000 (when the  family  left  Afghanistan).  We
      prefer the latter because this fits more closely  with  what  Mohammed
      has said about when he left Afghanistan and furthermore we consider it
      more likely that given his age and when he was  interviewed  for  that
      statement he would not be stating time periods with a  year  being  an
      exact 12 month period but reflecting his recollection of events.

  86. Mohammed's evidence in December 2007 was that JK was  12;  this  at  a
      time when he had left JK in Shamshatoo camp some  four  or  so  months
      earlier. We have great difficulty accepting this evidence. Although it
      was given  prior  to  JK  leaving  Afghanistan  and  although,  as  Mr
      Suterwalla points out, it would require forethought by the family,  we
      are of the view that this is what happened. There was  a  family  plan
      for the two younger boys to leave Afghanistan/Pakistan and an  account
      was prepared to attempt to ensure consistency in claimed ages  in  the
      light of known and anticipated benefits of being a minor. The  failure
      on the part of both Mohammed and JK  to  recollect  information  other
      than what their ages were concerned points to planning and  collusion.
      We therefore take the view that Mohammed's statement in December  2007
      (only a few months before JK left Afghanistan and during which time he
      was in contact with his father) cannot be relied upon at all.

  87. JK's evidence was that he first left Afghanistan aged  4.  Again,  for
      the reasons referred to in [86] above, we do  not  accept  this  as  a
      statement approaching the truth and have placed little weight upon it.



  88. There remains the difficulty of schooling. At most we accept  that  JK
      undertook 4 years of schooling and commenced that schooling aged 9  at
      the same school as Mohammed in  Katcha  Gari  camp.  We  have  serious
      doubts that he attended school in Shamshatoo camp despite  giving  the
      name of the school. It is not credible that Mohammed would be  totally
      unaware, as he claims, whether JK attended school in  Shamshatoo  camp
      even though Mohammed was only in the camp for a few months.; they were
      livng togther as a family  and  it  seems  to  us  inconceivable  that
      Mohammed would not be aware whether JK was going to school during that
      time.

  89. Mohammed and JK have said that they considered there was a 2  �  or  3
      year gap in their ages. Although we accept that JK is younger we  have
      taken the view, for the reasons set out above, that this purported age
      gap has been acquired by them  in  order  to  bolster  the  claim.  As
      evidence in itself therefore we have placed no weight upon it.

  90. Drawing all this together and doing the best we can with the  evidence
      the parties have chosen to put  before  us,  we  reach  the  following
      conclusions.
        a. We are entirely satisfied that JK was not told he was 13 the day
           before he left Afghanistan to come to the UK;
        b. Mohammed has a date of birth of 1st August 1992  which  we  have
           not displaced;
        c. JK is younger than Mohammed;
        d. The family left Afghanistan for the first time when Mohammed was
           aged 7 shortly after Gul Hashim was killed;
        e. Mohammed attended school for 4-5  years  during  which  time  JK
           started school;
        f. The family left Katcha Gari camp in April 2007;
        g. JK attended school  in  Katcha  Gari  camp  for  about  4  years
           starting when he was aged 9 and aged 13 when they left the camp;
        h. They attended the same school for some time in KatchaGari  camp;
           JK did not attend school in Shamshatoo camp;
        i. JK left Shamshatoo camp in April 2008 for Afghanistan  and  left
           Afghanistan April/May 2008 about 8/9 months after  Mohammed  had
           left for the UK;
        j. Mohammed was in touch with their father after  arriving  in  the
           UK;
        k. Mohammed, JK  and  the  family  have  colluded  to  put  forward
           evidence of an age gap of 2 - 3 years.

  91. Therefore despite the very great difficulties before us  with  regards
      to the evidence we  have  reached  the  only  conclusion  we  consider
      viable: that JK was born during 1993. JK says he started  school  aged
      9. We have taken that to be in the middle of his 9th year as  being  a
      reasonable assumption to make if he knew he  was  9  when  he  started
      school. Had he been just 9 we consider he would have said so and if he
      were nearly 10 he would have said so. Four years  attendance,  leaving
      the camp in April 2007 would mean that he would  have  started  school
      around April 2003. This would mean that he would  have  been  born  in
      September 1993. We  acknowledged  that  this  is  shortly  after   the
      earliest date referred to by Mr Suterwalla that  he  could  have  been
      born given Mohammed's age (May 1993) but when the evidence, such as it
      is, is considered as a whole, we are satisfied that the  short  period
      is not such as to weigh adversely overall. We have  allocated  a  date
      midway through September, the 15th. This therefore means that  JK  was
      at the hearing before us 18 years old and will be 19 on 15th September
      2012. Obviously the assumption that the age given reflects the  middle
      of the claimed age is little more than a guess but it is a guess based
      on a reasonable assumption that a child or young person is more likely
      to describe an age of which they are in the middle and if more to  one
      end of the year will add the words 'nearly' or 'almost' or 'just'.


Decision

  92. We make a declaration, therefore, that the claimant's date of birth is
      15th September 1993. The parties may make further written  submissions
      on the terms of any further orders sought and  in  particular  on  the
      issue of costs.
