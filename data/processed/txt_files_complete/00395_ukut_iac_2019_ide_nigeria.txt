Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr J Gajjar, instructed directly.
For the Respondent:    Mr S Kotas, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.


   1. An addition to the grounds of appeal requires the  permission  of  the
      Upper Tribunal.  That  is  so  even  if  the  case  has  been  granted
      permission following a Cart Judicial Review under CPR 54.7A.

   2. In deciding whether  to  grant  permission  to  rely  upon  additional
      grounds, the Tribunal will follow the same procedure as in relation to
      any other procedural default, in particular considering the length  of
      the delay (beginning with the date on which time  for  appeal  to  the
      Upper Tribunal expired).

   3. It is becoming increasingly clear that a substantial  number  of  Cart
      Judicial Review claims are succeeding in  circumstances  where  it  is
      difficult to imagine that the Full Court that decided Cart [2011] UKSC
      28 intended that the litigation should be prolonged in this way.


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant, a national of Nigeria, appeals to this Tribunal  against
    the decision of Judge Shore in the First-tier Tribunal, dismissing  his
    appeal against the decision of the Secretary of State on  10  May  2016
    refusing him indefinite leave to remain.  The letter  of  refusal  sets
    out the reasons for the decision, based on  discrepancies  between  the
    income declared for tax purposes, and  much  higher  levels  of  income
    claimed for immigration purposes, in two separate years.


 2. The appellant was admitted to  the  United  Kingdom  as  a  student  in
    February 2006, and had successive periods of student,  and  post-study,
    leave, due to expire on 3 March 2012.  On 1 April 2011 he  applied  for
    leave to remain as a Tier 1 general migrant.  That application required
    him to show that he had income at a certain level.  He claimed that  he
    had  income  of  �56,150.90,  including   self-employed   earnings   of
    �40,289.00, in the period from 7 May 2010 to 23 March 2011 (which  fell
    wholly within the 2010-11 tax year).  His application  was  successful,
    and he was granted leave from 20 May 2011 to 20 May 2013.


 3. On 17 May 2013, just before the expiry of that leave,  he  applied  for
    its extension.  He again had to show income at  a  certain  level.   He
    claimed that in the period 1 May 2012 to  30  April  2013  (which  fell
    within the 2012-13 tax year except for the last 25 days) his income was
    �57,912.80, consisting of employed earnings  of  �24,017.80  and  self-
    employed earnings of �33,895.00.  The application was  successful,  and
    he was granted leave from 2 June 2013 to 2 June 2016.


 4. On 10 May 2016 he applied for indefinite leave to remain on  the  basis
    of ten years' lawful residence in the United  Kingdom.   Investigations
    were made  with  Her  Majesty's  Revenue  and  Customs  (HMRC).   Those
    investigations revealed that in the 2010-11 tax year the appellant  had
    declared an income of �14,250.00 from all  sources  for  tax  purposes,
    including self-employed earnings of �7,258.00.  In the 2012-3 tax  year
    he declared a  total  income  of  �26,577.00,  including  self-employed
    earnings of �3,199.00.  In the 2013-14 tax year  he  declared  a  total
    income of �23,970.00, including no income from self-employment.


 5. We interject here that it can be seen that the discrepancy in the 2010-
    11 tax year is plain from the  figures  as  they  stand.   Because  the
    period of declared earnings in the 2013  application  spanned  two  tax
    years the position is not so clear, and in particular the  income  from
    employment may have been correct.  But figures for the income from self-
    employment over the two tax years show that only a total  of  �3,199.00
    was declared to HMRC for the two years, whereas  over  ten  times  that
    amount was claimed for immigration purposes for a period  that  was  in
    total half the period covered by those two tax years.


 6. The 2016 application was refused on the basis of  paragraph  322(5)  of
    the Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules,  HC  395  (as  amended),
    which provides that leave "should normally be refused"  on  the  ground
    of:

         "The undesirability of permitting the person concerned to enter  or
         remain in the United Kingdom in the light of his conduct (including
         [criminal convictions]), character or associations or the fact that
         he represents a threat to national security".

 7. The relevant part of the letter  of  refusal,  after  setting  out  the
    figures as above, continued as follows:

         "On review, it is clear that HMRC  records  of  your  self-employed
         income  for  the  tax  years  [sic]  ending   April   2011   differ
         significantly to [sic] the income you have declared  to  UKVI  [the
         relevant agency of the Secretary of State] in the application dated
         01 April 2011.
         You have completed  a  questionnaire  in  relation  to  your  self-
         employment in the UK and have not raised any concerns  in  relation
         to your tax record in the United Kingdom.
         You have also confirmed that you have used  accountants  'Bajwen  &
         Co' to assist you in referring your self-assessment tax returns.
         It is not clear whether you have actually earned the  self-employed
         income you declared to UKVI, and not declared this income to  HMRC,
         or whether this income was only created in  order  to  obtain  your
         Tier 1(General) visas[sic].  However, your application  of  10  May
         2016 is to be refused under general Grounds paragraph 322(5) of the
         Immigration Rules as  your  character  and  conduct  in  misleading
         government departments in relation to the previous income you  have
         earned would lead to the undesirability of permitting you to remain
         in the United Kingdom.
         It is acknowledged that Paragraph 322(5) of the  Immigration  Rules
         is not a mandatory refusal, however the evidence submitted does not
         satisfactorily demonstrate that the failure to declare to  HMRC  at
         the time  any  of  the  self-employed  earnings  declared  on  your
         previous application for leave to remain in the United Kingdom as a
         Tier 1 (General) Migrant was a genuine error.   It  is  noted  that
         there would have been a clear benefit to yourself either by failing
         to declare your full earnings to HMRC with respect to reducing your
         tax liability or by falsely representing your earnings to UK  Visas
         & Immigration to enable you to meet the points required  to  obtain
         leave to remain in  the  United  Kingdom  as  a  Tier  1  (General)
         Migrant.
         It is also noted that you have supplied evidence  to  support  that
         you have since declared these  claimed  self-employed  earnings  to
         HMRC.  The  fact  that  you  have  retrospectively  declared  these
         claimed earnings to HMRC is not sufficient to satisfy the Secretary
         of State that you have not previously been deceitful  or  dishonest
         in your dealings with HMRC and/or UK Visas & Immigration."

 8. Leave was therefore refused  under  the  provisions  relating  to  long
    residence, by reference to paragraph 322(5).  The  decision-maker  went
    on to consider the parts of the Rules concerned with article 8  of  the
    ECHR.  The appellant did not meet the  requirements  of  the  Rules  by
    virtue of his relationship with his partner or with  their  child;  his
    own claim based on private life was refused by reference  to  paragraph
    322(5).   The  decision-maker  then  considered  whether   there   were
    "exceptional circumstances" outside the factors covered  by  the  Rules
    and decided that the evidence did not justify a grant of leave.


 9. The appellant appealed.  His grounds of appeal, prepared by solicitors,
    assert that he had made an application earlier in  2016  and  had  been
    told that he would need to submit his self-assessment tax forms for the
    relevant years.  Asking his accountant for them he  was  promptly  told
    that "there had been some errors ... and that this  must  be  amended".
    He thereupon withdrew the application to allow time for the  amendment.
    By the time he re-applied he had, through  new  accountants,  made  the
    amendment.  He had never intended  to  deceive  and  was  a  victim  of
    professional  negligence.   It  was  "grossly  unfair"  to  refuse  his
    application under paragraph 322(5).  In  any  event  the  decision  was
    disproportionate for failure to take properly into account  his  rights
    under article 8.


10. Before Judge Shore the appellant was represented by counsel, instructed
    apparently by a  firm  of  solicitors  different  from  those  who  had
    prepared the grounds of appeal; but the matters raised at  the  hearing
    were fully in line with the grounds.  The appellant gave oral evidence.
     He confirmed that he has an MSc in IT security.  He said he had relied
    on his accountants, Bajwen & Co, and did not himself know much about UK
    tax law, but he said he had "probably" himself reviewed the figures  on
    the documents the accountants had  prepared  for  him.   He  could  not
    explain why he had not noticed the large  error  in  the  2011  return.
    There was evidence of his private life,  including  some  letters  from
    church members who regarded him as honest, and limited evidence of  his
    having engaged in voluntary community work.  There was no evidence from
    Bajwen & Co, nor any evidence that any  accusation  of  negligence  had
    been put to them, but there was a witness statement from another client
    of Bajwen & Co, who said the  firm  had  failed  to  meet  professional
    standards with his accounts for 2011, which he discovered in 2012; this
    was about the time that he had met the appellant, but he had  not  told
    him then of his experience with Bajwen & Co.


11. Judge Shore considered the evidence and the submissions made.   He  did
    not regard the appellant as a credible witness on the key  elements  of
    the case.  In particular,"he must be able to  understand  numbers  that
    are produced for him [and it is] implausible that a person educated  to
    the level that the appellant attained would not  notice  that  his  tax
    return contained an income figure of approximately �40,000 less than he
    had represented his income to be to UKVI".   It  was  also  implausible
    that, if the position was as the appellant claimed, he had  not  sought
    any redress from Bajwen & Co for their alleged failings.   Judge  Shore
    concluded that the "documents", including presumably  the  letter  from
    the other client of the accountants, were not to be  relied  upon.   He
    rejected the submission that the appellant would have  "no  motive"  to
    make a false tax return, because "he would have avoided a great deal of
    tax and National Insurance".


12. Judge Shore concluded that the appellant  was  "culpable"  in  his  tax
    returns, and, after citing R v SSHD ex parte Khawaja [1983] UKHL 8  and
    R (Giri) v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 784, that the Secretary  of  State  was
    entitled to take the  dishonesty  of  the  appellant  into  account  in
    refusing the application.  The appeal therefore failed  in  respect  of
    that part of the claim.  Looking then at article 8  within  the  Rules,
    Judge Shore noted that there are not "very  significant  obstacles"  to
    the appellant's return to Nigeria.


13. Outside the Rules, the judge balanced the aspects  of  the  appellant's
    private and family life of which he had  evidence  against  the  public
    interest, giving substantial weight  to  the  public  interest  in  the
    denial based on false tax returns and treating the  best  interests  of
    the appellant's children as primary.  He concluded  that  the  decision
    would not cause the United Kingdom to be in breach of  its  obligations
    under the ECHR.  So he dismissed the appeal.  His decision was sent out
    on 5 March 2018.


14. The appellant then sought permission to  appeal.   Grounds  drafted  by
    counsel (different from counsel who had represented him at the hearing)
    were submitted to the First-tier  Tribunal.   They  asserted  error  as
    follows:

           i) Failing to take into account Home Office Guidance [not
              apparently relied on at the hearing] indicating that a
              conviction was not necessary for paragraph 322(5) to apply,
              and that the question was whether "there is reliable evidence
              to support a decision that the person's behaviour calls into
              question their ...conduct ...to the extent that it is
              undesirable to allow them to ... remain in the UK".  This is
              linked with an assertion that as the appellant had made the
              amendment to his return before the present application, it
              might be that paragraph 322(5) did not apply at all.

          ii) Failing to determine for himself the exercise of the
              discretion under paragraph 322(5).  [This appears to be a
              reference to a ground of appeal not available since the
              coming into force of the amendments in appeal rights set out
              in the Immigration Act 2014.]

         iii) Not appreciating that there was now, since the hearing, a
              letter from Bajwen & Co saying that they were at fault and
              citing E and R v SSHD [2004] EWCA 49, but not explaining how
              the absence of such material previously was not attributable
              to the appellant.

          iv) Failing to appreciate that the standards of accountants
              cannot be expected to be as high as those of solicitors and
              failing to give any reason for the conclusion that the
              appellant lacked credibility.

           v) Wrong application of the principle in Tanveer Ahmed [2002]
              UKIAT 00439 on the basis that the dicta there apply only to
              overseas documents [the implication appears to be that the
              judge was obliged to take an unattested letter derived from
              within the United Kingdom as proving what it asserted].

          vi) Failure on the facts to balance the interests of the
              appellant against the public interest


15. Permission to appeal was refused.  The application was renewed  to  the
    Upper Tribunal.  The grounds, drafted by a third counsel, did not  save
    in one respect rely on the grounds put to the First-tier Tribunal,  but
    instead asserted as follows:


           i) The Secretary of State was not entitled to rely on paragraph
              322(5).  This ground relied on an unreported decision of a
              Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge, Judge D E Taylor, who said in
              her judgment in Kadian v SSHD (HU/11723/2016), sent out on 1
              May 2018, in relation to an appellant in similar
              circumstances, whose explanations had been rejected by the
              First-tier Tribunal, that "not declaring all relevant income,
              whilst highly regrettable, cannot properly be described as
              conduct such as that set out in the policy guidance. ... It
              cannot properly be said that his failure to disclose calls
              into question his character conduct and [sic] associations".
              [In view of what was said subsequently elsewhere, we have
              examined the text of this ground with care.  There is no
              accompanying text dealing with the citation of this
              unreported decision.  The decision is simply referred to, set
              out at length in the grounds, and annexed to them; and the
              ground concludes with a submission that 'thus' failure to
              take the policy into account was an error of law.]

          ii) In the light again of Kadian, the judge had failed to
              consider whether the respondent's reliance on paragraph
              322(5) was merited when undertaking the balance of public
              interest against the appellant's circumstances, and had in
              general failed to take all relevant circumstances into
              account.

         iii) It was unfair to ignore the new letter from the accountants.
              There was an [unidentified] reason why it was not available
              earlier, and if its absence was to be a matter of importance,
              it should now be taken into account.


16. Permission was refused by UTJ Keki?.  She said that she  did  not  take
    the unreported case into account as "there has been no  application  to
    adduce it".  She rejected the other grounds, because (a) the judge  had
    given clear reasons for his decision on the appellant's honesty and his
    conclusion on the balancing exercise; (b) "the argument now made  about
    the inadmissibility of 322(5) and the respondent's policy was  not  one
    which was made before the judge"; (c) the letter  from  the  accountant
    was not before the judge.  There was therefore no arguable error of law
    in the judge's decision.  Judge Keki?'s decision was made  on  22  June
    2018.


17. The history of this case immediately thereafter is not entirely easy to
    understand, particularly in view of the assertions of fact made  to  us
    at the hearing by Mr Gajjar, the fourth member of the bar to  represent
    the appellant in this appeal.  There was an application for  permission
    for Judicial Review of Judge Keki?'s decision on a Cart (R (Cart) v The
    Upper Tribunal [2011] UKSC 28) basis.   The  application,  filed  on  3
    August 2018, was made  by  Mr  Gajjar,  directly  instructed,  and  the
    grounds were drafted by him.  They assert as follows:

              (i) Judge Keki? was wrong to say what she did about paragraph
              322(5) because, as the judge recorded, the appellant's case
              was put on the basis that "paragraph 322(5) was not viable in
              this case because the allegations of deception or dishonesty
              in an old application cannot be taken into account in a new
              application".

          ii) Judge Keki? was wrong to refuse to take the unreported case
              into account on the ground that there had been no application
              to adduce it, because it was "more than arguable that the
              requirements for an application had been complied with";
              alternatively that given that this was merely an application
              for permission a "reasonable decision maker" would have
              granted permission [sic, not "considered whether to grant
              permission"] with a requirement to remedy any defect; in any
              event "it was implied from the grounds that the principle
              cannot be derived from other case law".





         iii) There had been a general failure to take into account the
              positive factors in the appellant's case; reference was
              specifically made to the decision of Foskett J in R (Ngouh) v
              SSHD in which, on a judicial review of the Secretary of
              State's decision [not an appeal to the Tribunal on grounds
              limited by statute, though that is not made clear in the
              grounds] the judge had made it clear that there was a
              balancing exercise involved in making the discretionary
              decision under paragraph 322(5).


18. The documents to which we have already referred were  included  in  the
    bundle supporting the Judicial review  application.   There  were  also
    copies of two other documents.  One was the Practice Directions of  the
    Immigration and Asylum Chambers of the First-tier Tribunal and  of  the
    Upper Tribunal in its then current emanation  (of  13  December  2014).
    Part 11 of that Direction reads, so far as material, as follows:

             "11. Citation of unreported determinations


             11.1.A determination of the Tribunal which has not been
             reported may not be cited in proceedings before the Tribunal
             unless:


                  (a) the person who is or was the appellant before the
                    First-tier Tribunal, or a member of that person's
                    family, was a party to the proceedings in which the
                    previous determination was issued; or
                  (b) the Tribunal gives permission.


             11.2.  An application for permission to cite a determination
             which has not been reported must:


                  (a) include a full transcript of the determination;
                  (b) identify the proposition for which the determination
             is to be cited; and
                  (c) certify that the proposition is not to be found in any
                    reported determination of the Tribunal, the IAT or the
                    AIT and had not been superseded by the decision of a
                    higher authority.


             11.3.  Permission under paragraph 11.1 will be given only
             where the Tribunal considers that it would be materially
             assisted by citation of the determination, as distinct from
             the adoption in argument of the reasoning to be found in the
             determination. Such instances are likely to be rare; in
             particular, in the case of determinations which were
             unreportable (see Practice Statement 11 (reporting of
             determinations)). It should be emphasised that the Tribunal
             will not exclude good arguments from consideration, but it
             will be rare for such an argument to be capable of being made
             only by reference to an unreported determination."

19. The other document was the decision of Martin Spencer J in  a  case  on
    Judicial Review in  the  Upper  Tribunal,  R  (Shahbaz  Khan)  v  SSHD,
    JR/3097/2017.  We need to say something about  this  decision,  but  we
    start by pointing out that as a decision on Judicial Review it carried,
    on publication, the status of a reported decision:  see  the  Chamber's
    Guidance Note  2011  No  2,  appendix,  paragraph  2(b)  (and  cf  ibid
    paragraph 4).  The decision itself was sent in draft  to  the  parties,
    including Mr Gajjar (who represented the applicant) in March 2018,  and
    subsequently finalised; it was published on UTIAC's website  apparently
    in July 2018.  It was given italic keywords, a headnote, and a  neutral
    citation number, on 16 November 2018.


20. Martin Spencer J's decision is a full reasoned judgment.  It sets out a
    number of propositions by way  of  guidance,  summarised  in  paragraph
    [37], several of which are relevant to the arguments  mounted  in  this
    appeal.  In particular he specifically held that where there has been a
    significant  difference  between  the  income  claimed  in  a  previous
    application for leave and the income declared  for  tax  purposes,  the
    Secretary of State is entitled to draw an inference that the  applicant
    has been deceitful or dishonest and to apply paragraph 322(5),  and  "I
    would expect the Secretary of State to draw that inference where  there
    is no plausible explanation  for  the  discrepancy";  and  that  simply
    blaming an accountant will not exonerate the applicant, but will  raise
    further questions which  may  need  to  be  resolved  by  reference  to
    disclosed correspondence between the applicant and his  accountant,  or
    specific explanations about why the applicant did  not  appreciate  the
    accountant's error.


21. On consideration of the application for Judicial Review on the  papers,
    HHJ  Mckenna  directed  the  Secretary   of   State   to   provide   an
    Acknowledgment of Service.  It was filed on 9 October.  It  objects  to
    the  applicant's  reliance  on  Kadian,  citing   seventeen   decisions
    (including Shahbaz  Khan)  to  the  contrary  effect,  all  substantive
    decisions on Judicial Review  claims  (so  all  having  the  status  of
    reported decisions) and including decisions by at least  six  different
    High Court judges.  It was also argued that the second appeal criteria,
    required for a successful Cart application, were not met.


22. Permission was granted  in  the  High  Court.   The  decision  made  no
    reference to the second appeal criteria, but on the substantive grounds
    observed as follows:

         "The  UTIAC  Judge  arguably  erred  in  failing  to  consider  the
         authorities on the scope of paragraph  322(5)  of  the  Immigration
         Rules,   including   the   unreported   UTIAC   decision,    Kadian
         HU/11723/2016.   It  is  arguable  that  the  unreported  decisions
         procedure was complied with, including  attaching  a  copy  of  the
         Kadian decision to the application for permission to  appeal.   The
         Secretary of State submits that Kadian  was  wrongly  decided,  and
         refers to ample authority in support.  However, this  point  should
         have been addressed by UTIAC when considering permission."

23. Following the usual procedure in cases of this type,  no  party  having
    sought a hearing, the decision  of  Judge  Keki?  was  on  12  December
    quashed  by  order  of  a  Master,  leaving  outstanding  the  original
    application to the Upper Tribunal for  permission  to  appeal,  on  the
    grounds summarised above at paragraph 22.


24. The appellant then took it upon himself to submit, through  Mr  Gajjar,
    what he called "Supplementary Grounds of Appeal", dated 8 January 2019.
     They include an application to amend the original grounds  based  only
    on an assertion that it would be in the interests of justice for "these
    additional factors to be considered", but in the final paragraph of the
    document there is a submission that "this  case  is  suitable  for  the
    grant of permission to appeal to  Upper  Tribunal  notwithstanding  the
    recently reporting [sic] of Spencer J's judgement in Khan which permits
    the use of paragraph 322(5)".


25. Permission to appeal was granted on 22 January 2019, expressly  in  the
    light of the decision of the High Court.  The grant of  permission  did
    not make any decision on the application to  amend  the  grounds.   The
    appeal was listed to be heard by  the  Tribunal  on  23  October.   The
    appellant sought an adjournment  on  the  ground  that  Mr  Gajjar  was
    "unavailable" on that day.  The adjournment  was  refused.   Mr  Gajjar
    appeared before us on 23 October.  His first task was to deal with  the
    application to amend the grounds, and, in particular,  to  explain  why
    the grounds upon which he now  sought  to  rely  could  not  have  been
    advanced within the time limited  for  the  application  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, which expired in the early summer of 2018.


26. Mr Gajjar's explanation was that he had been content  to  rely  on  the
    grounds considered by  Judge  Keki?  and  in  essence  relying  on  the
    proposition,  derived  from   Kadian,   that   paragraph   322(5)   was
    inapplicable in the present circumstances, until the decision  in  Khan
    was, as he put it, "reported" in November 2018.  He had then acted with
    what he thought of as promptness in drafting new grounds to  cover  the
    fact  that,  as  he  now  appreciated,  he  could  not  rely  on   that
    proposition.  He argued that Judge Shore had "failed to appreciate  the
    discretionary  nature"  of  paragraph  322(5),  although,   as   became
    apparent, he was unable to say what remedy  was  available  within  the
    existing appeals structure; that Judge Shore had failed to give  proper
    or adequate reasons for his decision  to  give  little  weight  to  the
    document from the other client of Bajwen & Co;  that  Judge  Shore  had
    failed to take into account the facts stated in that document,  or  the
    accounts submitted that would show that the appellant really had earned
    the income he had failed to declare (Mr Gajjar did not explain how  the
    latter  point  could  assist  the  appellant);  and  that  the  judge's
    conclusion that it was implausible that the appellant, with  his  level
    of education, would have made such understatements  mistakenly  because
    there  was  one  calculation  that  might  have  been   plausible   was
    irrational, and that the judge could not have  been  certain  that  the
    appellant's explanation was implausible.


27. Mr Kotas, for the Secretary of State, opposed Mr Gajjar's  application.
    We refused it at the hearing, noting that the failure  to  comply  with
    the rules was considerable, the delay being over six months  after  the
    end of a time limit of 14 days; that there was no adequate  explanation
    for the delay, that the grounds now  advanced  were  not  obviously  of
    great merit, and that (bearing in mind the interests of  both  parties)
    we were not persuaded that it  was  in  the  interests  of  justice  to
    enlarge the appeal to include these grounds.


28. Having had a fuller opportunity to consider the matter in the light  of
    the papers, we add this.  We find it extremely difficult to  understand
    fully the position Mr Gajjar was taking.  If the  decision  in  Shahbaz
    Khan (which has, with some reservations about  the  passage  quoted  in
    paragraph 20 above, also been  endorsed  by  the  Court  of  Appeal  in
    Balajigari v SSHD [2019] EWCA Civ 673) was what  caused  Mr  Gajjar  to
    appreciate that the principal grounds put to the Upper Tribunal had  no
    merit, then that was a position he was aware of from the time  of  that
    judgment, early in February 2018.  It is therefore not easy to see  why
    he advanced the Judicial  Review  grounds  that  he  did,  nor  why  in
    discharge of his duty of candidness he  did  not  also  cite  the  many
    authorities against him as a part of his grounds,  rather  than  simply
    attaching Shahbaz Khan as part of the bundle and making no reference to
    the wealth of decisions against him.  Even if Mr Gajjar was in some way
    unaware of the status of the decision in Shahbaz Khan and thought  that
    it had in some way changed when it was given  a  headnote,  we  do  not
    understand why he did not then promptly contact the High Court and  the
    respondent and interested  party  to  his  Judicial  Review  claim  and
    explain that the basis upon which the Court had given permission  could
    not now lead to a successful appeal.


29. It is not our role to challenge the decision of the High Court granting
    permission  in  the  Judicial  Review.   It   is,   however,   becoming
    increasingly clear that  a  substantial  number  of  these  claims  are
    succeeding in circumstances where it is difficult to imagine  that  the
    Full Court that decided Cart itself intended that the litigation should
    be prolonged in this way.  In the present case it is, with respect, not
    easy to see that the ground that appears to have found favour with  the
    Court was even made out, when the actual application is  compared  with
    the requirements set out in  the  Practice  Direction.   There  was  no
    identification of the proposition, and no certification.


30. Further, it is not easy to see why anybody might  think  that  a  claim
    based on Kadian could possibly succeed.  Its  apparent  ratio  is  that
    understatement of income for tax  purposes  is  incapable  of  engaging
    paragraph 322(5).  But that proposition is  contrary  to  a  wealth  of
    authority and must depend in part on the mistranscription in Kadian  of
    the  text  of  the  Rules,   substituting   "and"   for   "or"   before
    "associations" as noted in paragraph 15(i) above.


31. Here, whatever might be said about the application to  rely  on  Kadian
    that was the subject of the Upper Tribunal's decision, it appears  that
    permission was granted on grounds which had no  merit,  ought  to  have
    been withdrawn by their  proponent,  and  do  not  seem  to  have  been
    regarded as giving a reasonable prospect of success even in  the  grant
    of permission.  Further, as we have noted, the  decision  of  the  High
    Court gives no indication of why it was thought that the second  appeal
    criteria (set out in CPR 54.7A(7)(b)) were or  could  be  met  in  this
    case.  The result is that these proceedings have extended  a  good  way
    beyond the point at which the  appeal  should  have  been  regarded  as
    finally determined.


32. We return, belatedly it may be thought, to the appeal before us.  As Mr
    Gajjar acknowledged, once it is accepted that the  Secretary  of  State
    was entitled to decide the application by reference to paragraph 322(5)
    in the circumstances of this case, the surviving grounds of appeal  are
    rather limited.  Mr Gajjar attempted to repeat the ground based on  the
    point that that paragraph incorporates a discretion.  But, despite  the
    way in which, by reference to  formerly-available  grounds  of  appeal,
    that point was put at earlier stages of this case, it cannot  help  the
    appellant now.  We accept of course that if paragraph 322(5) were to be
    shown not to be applicable, then a human rights appeal  would,  in  its
    consideration of proportionality, have to take into  account  that  the
    refusal was based on a factor upon which it  ought  not  to  have  been
    based.  But where the decision does not have that feature of  potential
    unlawfulness, the discretion involved in making it can have  no  direct
    application to an appeal of this sort.


33. That leaves only the question whether it can be shown that Judge  Shore
    erred in his treatment of the evidence before  him  relating  to  other
    aspects of the appellant's life.  He dealt, as we have said,  with  the
    article 8 issues both within  and  outside  the  Rules  raised  by  the
    appellant's family life.  Although he referred to documents  evidencing
    other aspects of the  appellant's  life  he  did  not  deal  with  them
    specifically.


34. Those documents show that the appellant is active as a  member  of  his
    church and that his parish priest and others regard him as  honest,  an
    opinion that must now be read in the light of Judge  Shore's  findings.
    There is also limited evidence of voluntary work: the organiser records
    a break (of unspecified length) in this work, and  the  evidence  cites
    only one person specifically assisted.


35. Mr Kotas submitted that it was wholly unrealistic to think  that  there
    was any possibility that this evidence, however fully considered, could
    have affected the outcome of the appeal.  We entirely agree.  The Judge
    found  that  the  appellant  was  responsible  for   the   considerable
    understatement of his income for tax purposes, and  that  that  weighed
    heavily in determining the proportionality of refusing him leave.   The
    appellant cannot meet the requirements  of  the  Rules.   In  order  to
    succeed, he would have to show that the individual circumstances of his
    case justify a conclusion that despite not meeting the requirements  of
    the rules he is entitled to remain.  The evidence upon which he  relies
    for that purpose is in our  judgment  insufficient  even  seriously  to
    raise the question.


36. Judge Shore's decision contained no error of law.  This appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal is dismissed.
