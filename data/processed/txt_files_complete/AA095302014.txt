Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr M Diwnycz, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr G Brown, of Counsel

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department
    against the First-tier Tribunal decision allowing Mr Alexander's appeal
    against the Secretary of State's decision of 23rd October 2014 refusing
    to grant him asylum and refusing him leave to enter the United Kingdom.

 2. For the purposes of this decision I shall refer  to  the  Secretary  of
    State  as  "the  Respondent"  and  Mr  Alexander  as  "the  Appellant",
    reflecting their positions as they were in the appeal before the FtT.

 3. The Appellant is a citizen of Trinidad and Tobago  born  19th  December
    1987. He has an extensive immigration history which it is necessary  to
    recite here. He first came to the United Kingdom in  2006  on  a  visit
    visa. He overstayed this visa and remained here until 2008. During that
    time he started a relationship with a woman, OA, whom  he  subsequently
    married in the UK in November 2014.

 4. The Appellant returned to Trinidad and Tobago from 2008 until 2011.  He
    then came back  to  the  United  Kingdom  on  1st  September  2011  and
    attempted to gain entry at Gatwick airport. No doubt  in  view  of  his
    past immigration history  the  Appellant  was  refused  entry  but  was
    granted temporary admission until 7th September 2011  for  his  removal
    back to Trinidad and Tobago. The Appellant failed to return to Gatwick,
    absconded from the conditions of his temporary admission  and  remained
    here unlawfully. He managed to avoid coming to  the  attention  of  the
    authorities again  until  he  was  arrested  in  Huddersfield  by  West
    Yorkshire Police on charges of possession of an  offensive  weapon  and
    wounding with intent. His arrest took place on 15th December 2013  over
    two years after he failed to report to Gatwick airport for removal.  He
    then claimed asylum on 16th December 2013, the day following his arrest
    by the police. He also claimed that he  had  resumed  his  relationship
    with OA, who by  this  time  had  given  birth  to  a  son  J,  from  a
    relationship with another man. He stated that, although he was not  the
    biological father of J, he regarded J as his own child.

 5. The Appellant's appeal  was  heard  on  17th  February  2015  by  Judge
    Kempton. She heard evidence from the Appellant, his wife OA, his father
    and OA's mother. The Judge found that the Appellant was not entitled to
    a grant of asylum. She made clear findings on that matter and there has
    never been any challenge to those findings. However she did  go  on  to
    say at [32],

         "In this case, there is a separate strand to the grounds of appeal.
         That is in relation to Article 8 and private and  family  life.  It
         may be that this is an argument which could bear more fruit for the
         appellant."

 6. After setting out the background to the Article 8 claim the Judge  said
    this at [34],

         "When he returned to Trinidad, he tried to  maintain  contact  with
         his then girlfriend, OA. The distance proved too difficult for  her
         and she entered into another relationship with another man by  whom
         she became pregnant. He disappeared on learning of  the  pregnancy.
         When the appellant managed to return to the UK on 1 September 2011,
         he immediately sought out OA and met her son, J, born on  16  March
         2010. He calls the appellant "Daddy" as he wants  to  be  like  the
         other children at the nursery and  now  at  school,  which  he  has
         started. J never  had  any  meaningful  contact  with  his  natural
         father. The appellant has been a constant in his life as  a  father
         figure for the past three and a half  years.  The  appellant  looks
         after J to allow OA to work in a caf�. She was working part time 24
         hours a week but in the past several weeks  she  has  been  working
         more hours, nearer full-time, on account of the  need  for  her  to
         undertake overtime to cover staff leave. The appellant and OA  wish
         to have a child of their own  and  to  that  end,  they  have  made
         enquiries about IVF treatment which will cost �3000.  They  married
         in Huddersfield on 19 November 2014. They continue to have a strong
         and loving relationship."

 7. The Judge went on in [40] to say;

         "However, the nature and quality of the relationship with all three
         members of this small family is very strong, I can see that. I  can
         also see that they are each devoted to the  other  members  of  the
         family and that they are a very strong unit..."

 8. She then took into account Section 117B (as inserted by section  19  of
    the Immigration Act 2014) Article  8:  Public  interest  considerations
    applicable in all cases.

    After consideration she allowed the appeal under Article 8.

 9. Permission to appeal to the UT was sought  by  the  Respondent  on  the
    grounds that the FtT's decision disclosed a  material  misdirection  as
    the Judge had erred in her approach when considering  Article  8.  This
    was because she did not specifically consider the Appellant's  position
    under the Immigration Rules and therefore had  not  considered  whether
    other factors outweighed his child's best interests.

10. The Respondent referred to Section 117B(6) and  said  it  was  arguable
    that the Judge had treated an acceptance of the best interests  of  the
    child being to remain in the United Kingdom, as answering the  question
    of whether it would be reasonable for that child to  leave  the  United
    Kingdom. She did so without further enquiry into what is reasonable and
    whether  the   child's   interests   can   be   outweighed   by   other
    considerations.

11. Permission was granted on 11th March 2015.

Appeal Hearing/Submissions

12. The appeal came before me on  31st  July  2015  at  Bradford.  I  heard
    submissions  from  both  representatives  on  the  error  of  law.  The
    Appellant was in attendance but not required to give oral evidence.

13. Mr Diwnycz relied in the main on the  grounds  seeking  permission.  He
    expanded them by submitting that the Judge  in  short,  had  erred,  by
    straying into a free standing  Article  8  assessment.  He  did  accept
    however that there was no challenge to the  background  factual  matrix
    which the Judge had relied on to make her findings.

14. Mr Brown responded by saying  that  the  Judge  had  been  put  in  the
    position of the primary fact finder because the  Respondent's  original
    Reasons for Refusal letter of 23rd October 2014 does not  reflect  what
    has now been found to be the correct  position  under  the  Appellant's
    Article 8 claim. The Reasons for Refusal  letter  did  not  accept  the
    relationship between the Appellant, OA and  J  as  genuine.  The  Judge
    however considered the  evidence  and  made  clear  findings  that  the
    Appellant is the de facto father of J and that  the  relationships  are
    genuine ones and that the Appellant had been in a relationship with  OA
    since his return here in September 2011. The relationship  between  the
    appellant and J led the Judge to consider Section 117B.

15. He said she had set out adequate reasons why family  life  between  the
    Appellant, OA and J could not continue in Trinidad  and  Tobago.  Those
    findings were adequate to demonstrate insurmountable  obstacles.   What
    they amounted to is this the Appellant's wife works  in  the  UK,  they
    have a home here and J has started  school  here.  Added  to  this  the
    Appellant is a relationship  with  a  qualifying  child  and  therefore
    Section 117B applies.

Is there an Error of Law?

16. At [38] the Judge succinctly sets out the issue before her.

         "It is the position of the respondent that the appellant can return
         to Trinidad and Tobago and live there, perhaps  in  Tobago.  It  is
         also the position of the respondent that the  appellant  can  enjoy
         family life with OA and J in Tobago. Maybe in theory that would  be
         possible. However, OA will not go there. All her family is  in  the
         UK. All of the appellant's family is  in  the  UK.  The  respondent
         considers that it would not be unduly harsh for  the  appellant  to
         return and for the whole family unit to go with him. I disagree."

17. Whilst it is correct to say that the Judge engages in the  Razgar  test
    and nowhere does she spell out that she has had regard to  Appendix  FM
    and 276ADE, nevertheless it appears she kept those matters in mind when
    arriving at the findings she made. She accepted and sets  out  at  [39]
    that the Appellant had entered into a relationship when he had no right
    to be here; continued with that relationship when  he  returned  as  an
    unlawful overstayer and committed a crime. Nevertheless she found  that
    when  considering all matters as  she  is  required  to  do,  paragraph
    117B(6) of the Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act (as  inserted  by
    Section 19 of the Immigration Act 2014)  tipped the balance  in  favour
    of the Appellant.

18. Paragraph 117B makes clear that those factors which are listed must  be
    taken into account. However it is  also  correct  to  say  that  if  an
    Appellant can bring himself within the exception contained  in  Section
    117B(6) then the  assessment  of  proportionality  would  result  in  a
    decision in the Appellant's favour because the public interest side  of
    the scale has been removed.

19. The Judge has made a clear finding, and this has not  been  challenged,
    that the Appellant has a genuine and subsisting  parental  relationship
    with a qualifying child. There is a second part to 117B(6)  and  it  is
    said on the Respondent's part that the Judge erred because  she  failed
    to give adequate reasons  why it is not  reasonable  to  expect   J  to
    leave the UK and follow the Appellant to Trinidad and Tobago.

20. Interestingly the question of  whether an Appellant, who,  as  in  this
    case,  is a child's step-father, can on  a  literal  interpretation  of
    Section 117B(6) be said to have a  subsisting  "parental"  relationship
    with a qualifying child, was  not  raised  before  the  FtT.   For  the
    purposes of this decision it seems  to  have  been  accepted  that  the
    Appellant counts as J's 'parent'.

21. That being so the only question to be answered is whether the Judge has
    said in sufficient terms it would not be  reasonable  to  expect  J  to
    leave the United Kingdom.

22. Whilst I accept that the Judge may not have given the  answer  to  this
    question in stark terms, it  is  plain  from  a  full  reading  of  the
    decision that she found the following. J is a  British  child  who  has
    lived here all his life with his mother, is just about to start primary
    school, lives with his mother who says she will not go to Trinidad  and
    Tobago, because she has employment here and  has  her  home  here.  The
    Judge further found that J would be 'devastated' to lose the person  he
    regards as his father.

23. As I said earlier there is no real challenge to the background facts or
    findings made in this case. There is certainly no suggestion made  that
    any of the findings made are perverse or irrational.   I  am  satisfied
    therefore that whilst the Judge's findings may be described as generous
    they are ones which were open to her to make.

24. For the foregoing reasons I am satisfied that the decision of  the  FtT
    discloses no material error of law. The  appeal  of  the  Secretary  of
    State is therefore dismissed.

Decision

25. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal discloses no error of  law  and
    the decision therefore stands.

No anonymity direction is made
