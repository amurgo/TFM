                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    The appellant, a citizen of the Democratic Republic of Congo  appeals
      the determination of an Adjudicator, Mr G D Birt  who  dismissed  his
      appeal against the decision of the Secretary of State to  refuse  his
      application for asylum.

2.    The appellant was represented by Miss G Oliso of  the  Refugee  Legal
      Centre while Miss J Sigley appeared for the Secretary of State.

3.    The appellant said he worked as a driver in Kinshasha from 1995 until
      his departure on 21 September 1998.  He applied for asylum on arrival
      in the United Kingdom.   He said that his employer had been an editor
      of a newspaper and had encountered difficulties under the  regime  of
      President Mobutu which had continued  under  the  regime  of  Laurent
      Kabila.  The  appellant's  employer  had  had  problems  with  Kabila
      because Kabila was against the Tutsis of  which  he  was  one.    The
      appellant's  employer  had  accordingly  gone  to  Brazzaville.   The
      employers colleagues including the appellant were then all accused of
      treason because it was thought  they  were  behind  their  employer's
      escape.   The appellant was summons to go to the  police  station  in
      Kinshasha.   He was questioned about his employer  but  was  released
      without  charge  and  went  home.    The  following  day  6  soldiers
      ransacked his house and beat the appellant and his brothers.

4.    The appellant gave evidence before the Adjudicator who did not accept
      that the appellant was a credible witness.   In paragraph 18  of  his
      determination he gives his reasons:

      "I do not regard the appellant as a credible witness.  There  were  a
      number of matters, concerning which he was not telling the truth.  He
      would well know how many brothers and sisters he had.  First  he  had
      said he had seven brothers then altered  it  to  three  brothers  and
      three sisters.  He was asked after his house had been ransacked where
      his girlfriend had gone.  He said that she had remained in their home
      at all times and then said that  she  had  returned  to  her  mother.
      Regarding the document requiring him to go the police station he said
      he had received this through the post.  It is very doubtful that such
      an important document would be sent in this manner.   Further  if  it
      was thought the whereabouts of [the appellant's employer]  to  be  of
      such importance the authorities would have raided his house, searched
      it and then taken him to the police station.  I have to look  at  the
      testimony of the appellant on the basis that  he  did  not  tell  the
      truth on those matters.  It can be said that  none  of  them  are  of
      importance and are possibly relatively  trivial.   However,  it  cast
      doubts upon other matters on which he gave evidence which go  to  the
      core of his case.  That is he was taken to  the  police  station  and
      beaten to try and elicit information about  the  whereabouts  of  his
      employer.  Because I do not accept his evidence on the other  matters
      I do not regard this incident as having happened.   He  said  he  had
      marks on his face  which  were  the  injuries  sustained  during  the
      beating.  I do not accept that the marks on his face were injuries as
      a result of the beating.  One significant matter that was not said to
      him when he spoke to his  brother  on  the  telephone  was  that  the
      authorities had come to their home in order to look for him.  If this
      had been said the appellant would have clearly remembered it and  the
      fact that his brother had not told him  on  the  telephone  that  the
      authorities had been to his home meant they had not  which  can  only
      mean they were no longer interested in him."

5.    The Adjudicator noted that the appellant had  been  in  this  country
      since September 1998 and there was no evidence  to  show  anyone  was
      interested in him in the DRC. He also dealt with human rights issues.



6.    Miss Oliso submitted that the Adjudicator had erred in relying on the
      discrepancies when none of them were of importance and were indeed as
      the Adjudicator found relatively trivial.  She relied on the  grounds
      of appeal in which reference is made to the case of Chiver (10758), a
      case decided on 10 March 1994.

7.    Miss Oliso submitted that the Adjudicator had  erred  in  relying  on
      trivial matters and had  failed  to  have  regard  to  the  objective
      material before him.   She referred to the state  of  those  arrested
      and executed because of suspected involvement in Kabila's  execution.
       It was pointed out that the appellant  had  left  his  country  long
      before this event.   Miss Oliso referred us to the objective material
      concerning the war in August 1998 when Laurent Kabila  had  tried  to
      expel Rwandan military forces that had helped him  overthrow  Mobutu.



8.    Miss Sigley submitted that it was clear from paragraph  17  that  the
      Adjudicator had referred to the Country  Information  Reports  before
      him and in  particular  to  the  events  in  August  1998  where  the
      government security forces had systematically arrested  and  detained
      Tutsis throughout the country.  The Adjudicator had found that  there
      were discrepancies in the appellant's account and he was entitled  to
      make the finding that he had made in the circumstances of this  case.
       The appeal should be dismissed.

9.    We have carefully considered the points  made  on  both  sides.    In
      ground 2 of the grounds of appeal settled by the Refugee Legal Centre
      it is accepted that an Adjudicator is entitled  to  find  that  minor
      discrepancies cast doubt upon other aspects of an account.   However,
      it was not accepted "that an Adjudicator is entitled  to  reject  the
      entire account because of minor discrepancies without giving  further
      consideration  to  the  core  of  the  account.    This  approach  is
      inconsistent with Chiver (10758) 10 March  1994.    It  is  submitted
      that the Adjudicator has not given adequate consideration to the core
      facts of the appellant's claim."

10.   The case of Chiver is often relied  on  by  appellants.    It  is  of
      course perfectly correct that a story should not be  rejected  solely
      on the basis of minor discrepancies.    A truthful witness  may  make
      mistakes because  of  nerves  or  forgetfulness  or  because  of  the
      experiences that have been suffered, for example.   However, it  does
      not follow that a witness who falters over what might  appear  to  be
      peripheral matters is in all cases a witness of truth.   A person who
      has made up his story  may  get  the  central  elements  right.    An
      Adjudicator will have to use his common sense and experience to  make
      his findings.  He will need to  consider  whether  an  account  which
      frays at the edges from time to time is nevertheless a  truthful  one
      or  alternatively  whether  the  witness   has   got   himself   into
      difficulties  in  unplanned  departures  from  a  pre-rehearsed   and
      unreliable script.

11.   We have no doubt that the  Adjudicator  was  very  conscious  of  the
      dangers of making  unfair  adverse  credibility  findings.    He  had
      indeed been alerted during the course of submissions, as  we  pointed
      out to Miss Oliso, that any mistakes made by the  appellant  had  not
      gone to the core of his claim.   On any fair reading of paragraph  18
      of the determination it  is  clear  that  the  Adjudicator  had  this
      submission in mind.   He had the advantage of hearing and seeing  the
      witness give evidence and it was for  him  to  decide  what  kind  of
      witness this appellant was.   The Adjudicator relies on discrepancies
      and implausibilities as well as the conversation  the  appellant  had
      with his brother on the telephone.

12.   We feel that the Adjudicator's findings were properly open to him and
      are not unfair or unsafe.  Miss Oliso also relied  on  the  objective
      materials and submitted that the Adjudicator had not  had  regard  to
      them.   This was not a complaint made in the grounds of appeal and we
      do not see any foundation for it.   As Miss Sigley pointed  out,  the
      Adjudicator had indeed referred to the objective material.

13.   We see no reason to interfere with the Adjudicator's findings in this
      matter.   This appeal is dismissed.
