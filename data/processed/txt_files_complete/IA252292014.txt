                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction and Background

 1. The Secretary of State appeals against a decision of Judge Majid of the
    First-tier Tribunal (the FTT) promulgated on 12th April 2016.

 2. The Respondent before the Upper Tribunal was the Appellant  before  the
    FTT and we will refer to him as the Claimant.

 3. The Claimant is a male Indian citizen born 16th September 1985  who  on
    26th March 2014 applied for leave to remain in  the  UK  as  a  Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur).  He was interviewed in connection with his  application
    on 21st May 2014, and his application was refused on 2nd June 2014.

 4. The Secretary of  State  refused  the  application  with  reference  to
    paragraph 245DD(h), (i) and (k).  In brief summary it was not  accepted
    that the Claimant had ï¿½50,000 of investment funds available, and it was
    not accepted that he genuinely intended to  invest  these  funds  in  a
    business.  It was not accepted that the Claimant had demonstrated  that
    he had a  viable  or  credible  business  proposal,  nor  that  he  had
    undertaken credible market research.  It  was  not  accepted  that  the
    Claimant had sufficient previous educational and employment  experience
    in the business area in which he intended to operate.

 5. The Claimant appealed  pursuant  to  section  82  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, and his appeal was heard by the FTT on
    6th April 2016.  The FTT allowed the appeal concluding at paragraph 18;

         "In the circumstances, in view of my deliberations in the preceding
         paragraphs and having taken  into  account  all  of  the  oral  and
         documentary evidence as well as the submissions at my  disposal,  I
         am  persuaded  that  the  Appellant  comes  within   the   relevant
         immigration law, as amended."

 6. The Secretary of State applied for permission to appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal.  The grounds for seeking permission are summarised below.

 7. It was contended that the FTT  had  demonstrated  a  complete  lack  of
    regard and application of the Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)  rules,  and  had
    carried out an irrelevant  consideration  of  Article  8  of  the  1950
    European Convention on Human Rights  (the  1950  Convention).   It  was
    unclear whether the appeal had been allowed under the Immigration Rules
    or Article 8.

 8. The FTT had found the claimant to be involved in  a  genuine  business,
    but gave no reasons for this finding.  The FTT  had  failed  to  engage
    with the reasons given by the  Secretary  of  State  for  refusing  the
    application.

 9. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge J M Holmes of the FTT in  the
    following terms;

         "3.  It is arguable, as set out in the  grounds,  that  this  brief
             decision discloses either a failure to engage adequately  with
             the disputed issues of fact raised by the appeal, or a failure
             to give adequate  reasons  for  the  findings  made  on  those
             disputed issues of fact.  It is thus arguably unclear from the
             decision that the judge has engaged upon a fair hearing of the
             appeal.

         4.   In any event the decision arguably discloses a material  error
             in the judge's approach to the Article 8 appeal,  and  to  the
             terms of section 117, to which  no  reference  is  made.   The
             judge makes no reference to any  relevant  jurisprudence,  and
             makes no finding that Article 8 is  engaged  by  the  decision
             under appeal."

10. Following the grant  of  permission,  the  Claimant  did  not  lodge  a
    response pursuant to rule 24 of The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)
    Rules 2008.  Directions were issued making provision for there to be  a
    hearing before the Upper Tribunal to ascertain whether the FTT decision
    contained an error of law such that it should be set aside.


The Upper Tribunal Hearing

11. Miss Isherwood relied upon the grounds contained within the application
    for permission to appeal, and the grant of permission.

12. Mr  Saini  realistically  conceded  that  the  FTT  decision  contained
    material errors of law, as contended on  behalf  of  the  Secretary  of
    State.

13. Both representatives agreed that the FTT decision should be  set  aside
    and it was suggested that the appropriate course was for the appeal  to
    be remitted back to the FTT to be heard afresh.


 Our Conclusions and Reasons

14. As announced at the hearing, the decision of the FTT contains  material
    errors of law and is set aside.  No findings are  preserved.   The  FTT
    erred by failing to engage with the issues in the appeal.  The FTT  did
    not adequately consider the reasons given by the Secretary of State for
    rejecting the Claimant's application, and did not  adequately  consider
    the  relevant  Immigration  Rules.   The  FTT  did  not  make  reasoned
    findings.  It is unclear whether the FTT purported to allow the  appeal
    under the Immigration rules or Article 8.  The consideration of Article
    8 is inadequate and makes no reference to section 117B of the 2002 Act.



15. We have considered paragraph  7  of  the  Senior  President's  Practice
    Statements, and it is appropriate to remit  this  appeal  to  the  FTT.
    This is because there has not been a fair hearing before the  FTT,  and
    the nature and extent of  judicial  fact-finding  which  is  necessary,
    means that it is more appropriate for this appeal to be decided by  the
    FTT, rather than the Upper Tribunal.

16. Therefore the appeal of the Secretary  of  State  is  allowed  and  the
    appeal is remitted to the FTT to be considered afresh with no  findings
    of fact preserved.  The appeal is to be heard by  an  FTT  Judge  other
    than Judge Majid.   It  is  understood  that  no  interpreter  will  be
    required.  If that is not  the  case  the  Claimant's  solicitors  must
    notify the FTT immediately.



Notice of Decision

The decision of the FTT contained material errors of law and is  set  aside.
The appeal of the Secretary of State is  allowed  to  the  extent  that  the
appeal is remitted back to the FTT for fresh consideration.


Anonymity

No anonymity direction was made by the FTT.  No application was made to  the
Upper Tribunal for anonymity.  We see no need to make an anonymity order.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

The Tribunal makes no fee award.   The  issue  of  any  fee  award  must  be
considered by the FTT when the decision is re-made.
