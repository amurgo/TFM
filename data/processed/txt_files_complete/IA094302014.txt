Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Kannangara, Counsel, instructed by Legend
                    Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms Rackstraw, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


      1. The Appellant is a citizen of India, born  on  20  April  1982.  He
         entered the UK on 18 July 2011 as a Tier 1  (Post  Study)  Migrant,
         with leave to remain until 10 July 2013.

      2. On 10 July 2013 the Appellant applied for a variation to his  leave
         as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur), which  application  was  refused  on  6
         February 2014, when the  Respondent  also  made  in  consequence  a
         decision to remove him from the UK by reference to s47 of the  2006
         Act.

      3. The Appellant's appeal  against  those  immigration  decisions  was
         heard on 30  September  2014,  and  dismissed  in  a  Determination
         promulgated  on  8  October  2014  by  First  Tier  Tribunal  Judge
         Sanderson.

      4. By a decision of First Tier  Tribunal  Judge  PJG  White  dated  25
         November  2014  the  First  Tier  Tribunal  granted  the  Appellant
         permission to appeal on the basis it was arguable there was a  lack
         of fairness in the appeal process because the  Respondent  had  not
         produced a copy of the transcript of the Appellant's  interview  to
         the Appellant or in evidence to the Tribunal.

      5. The Respondent filed a Rule 24  Notice  on  9  December  2014.  She
         points out that the Judge made adverse findings in relation to  the
         Appellant's oral evidence on the issue of whether or not the  funds
         in his bank account were his own. The Judge was entitled to do  so,
         for the reasons that he gave, and there was in these  circumstances
         no unfairness in the approach adopted.

      6. Neither party has applied  for  permission  to  rely  upon  further
         evidence pursuant to Rule 15(2A) of the  Upper  Tribunal  Procedure
         Rules 2008. Thus the matter comes before me.

    Adjournment

      7. It is common ground that  the  Appellant  was  interviewed  by  the
         Respondent on 4 December 2013 in relation to his application for  a
         variation to his leave to remain, and that  a  full  transcript  of
         that interview has never been produced by  the  Respondent  to  the
         Appellant, or by either party in the course of  the  evidence  they
         have placed before the Tribunal.

      8. It is however also common ground that the Appellant did  not  place
         before the Judge any correspondence requesting  the  disclosure  of
         that interview transcript written  either  before,  or  after,  the
         decisions under  appeal  were  taken.  Mr  Kannangara  very  fairly
         accepts that no such correspondence exists.

      9.  Moreover  Mr  Kannangara  accepts  that  no  application  for   an
         adjournment of the hearing of the  appeal  was  ever  made  to  the
         Tribunal on the Appellant's behalf, either in writing in advance of
         that hearing, or at the hearing itself. He accepts that he was  not
         instructed to make such an application.

     10. In the circumstances Mr Kannangara accepts that the Upper  Tribunal
         must proceed on the basis that either those advising the  Appellant
         never saw any need for sight of the transcript of  the  Appellant's
         interview, or, that those advisers were nonetheless  instructed  to
         proceed with the appeal  despite  its  absence  from  the  evidence
         before the Tribunal.




    The criticism raised in the grounds

     11. Mr Kannangara accepts that the grounds are  not  well  drafted.  He
         argues that in truth they raise only one complaint, namely that the
         Respondent's  failure  to  produce  the  full  transcript  of   the
         interview meant that the hearing of the  appeal  was  in  some  way
         rendered unfair.

     12.  Mr  Kannangara  made  no  reference  to  the  decision   in   Miah
         (interviewer's comments:  disclosure:  fairness)  [2014]  UKUT  515
         (despite that decision  being  referred  to  in  the  text  of  the
         decision to grant permission). Nor did he  make  reference  to  the
         decision in MM (unfairness; E&R) Sudan [2014] UKUT 105. Nor did  he
         seek to argue that the Respondent's own decision making process was
         itself in any way unfair, and thereby vitiated.

     13. The context  in  which  this  decision  making  process  was  being
         undertaken was in my judgement significantly different to both that
         which was discussed in Miah [12-13], and in MM.

     14. In Miah the Respondent's decision was  that  the  applicant  and  a
         third party had entered into a "marriage of convenience". Thus  the
         context was a decision making process that  could  taint  both  the
         applicant and the other party to the marriage with a decision  that
         was in essence a finding of dishonesty, creating significant damage
         to the applicant's immigration history and capable of operating  to
         his real detriment in the future. (Indeed, although a finding  made
         on the civil standard of proof, it would nonetheless be  a  finding
         that both had conspired to commit a criminal offence.) This context
         required a decision maker  to  be  afforded  all  of  the  relevant
         material that was available in relation to the marriage, and  would
         allow them to make a fully informed decision. A mere summary of the
         interview provided by the  interviewing  officer  together  with  a
         statement of their opinion of what had  occurred  was  said  to  be
         insufficient.  Moreover  this  context  required  in  fairness  the
         applicant to be alerted to  the  essential  elements  of  the  case
         against him, and thus the evidence upon which  the  decision  maker
         relied.

     15. In MM the Respondent's decision concerned an application for asylum
         by a woman who was accepted to be a citizen  of  Sudan,  but  whose
         claim to be a Coptic Christian who had been persecuted  on  account
         of her faith  was  rejected.  It  is  self  evident  that  such  an
         application warranted  the  most  anxious  scrutiny.  The  Tribunal
         accepted that the decision maker  had  not  taken  into  account  a
         letter written on the  applicant's  behalf  immediately  after  her
         interview complaining that  questions  and  answers  had  not  been
         properly translated by the interpreter employed by  the  Respondent
         for that purpose. Nor was that letter part of the  evidence  placed
         before the Tribunal at first instance. As a  result  the  applicant
         was  cross-examined  to  demonstrate  inconsistencies  between  the
         record of her interview and her oral evidence, and it  was  put  to
         her (and accepted by the Tribunal at  first  instance)  that  these
         inconsistencies were the result of fabrication. The Upper  Tribunal
         found  in  these  circumstances  that  there  had  been  procedural
         unfairness that had not resulted from the  actions  of  either  the
         applicant or the Tribunal, but which  vitiated  both  the  decision
         upon the application, and the decision of  the  Tribunal  at  first
         instance.

     16. There is in my judgement no such context  to  the  decision  making
         process that led to the decisions that were under appeal before the
         Tribunal at first instance in this case. The  application  did  not
         concern anything so fundamental to the applicant  as  either  their
         marriage, or their asylum  claim,  which  in  my  judgement  is  an
         important point of distinction in  itself.  Nor  did  the  decision
         taint the applicant (or anyone else) with a finding of  dishonesty.
         Moreover the text of the decision does not suggest of  itself  that
         the decision maker was  denied  sight  of  the  transcript  of  the
         interview in question,  and  provided  with  only  a  summary.  The
         essential elements and reasons for the decision were set out in the
         Respondent's letter dated 6 February 2014 which  identified  in  my
         judgement in clear and unambiguous terms  why  the  Respondent  had
         formed the view that this was not  the  application  of  a  genuine
         entrepreneur, and so the applicant knew precisely the case that  he
         faced.

     17.  Mr  Kannangara  accepted  that  he  was  unable  to  identify  any
         unfairness in the Tribunal's  implicit  decision  to  hear  and  to
         dispose of the appeal in the absence of the transcript,  given  the
         failure on the part of those advising the Appellant to either  seek
         the disclosure of the transcript, or to seek any adjournment of the
         hearing of the appeal pending that disclosure. He formally accepted
         that he did not assert that in the circumstances of this  case  the
         Tribunal should have taken the decision to adjourn the  hearing  of
         the appeal of its own motion.

     18. Even now no steps have been taken on behalf  of  the  Appellant  to
         seek the disclosure of the transcript of the interview.

     19. Although he had argued before the Judge that  the  Tribunal  should
         disregard the fact that the Appellant had been the  subject  of  an
         interview, and thus disregard the  question  and  answer  that  was
         quoted in the reasons for refusal of the application, Mr Kannangara
         accepted that the Appellant had not disputed in his  oral  evidence
         that this was a question he had been asked, and the answer that  he
         had given to it. Indeed, as the  Determination  record,  that  same
         answer was repeated by the Appellant during the course of his  oral
         evidence at the hearing to the same, or a  similar  question  [43].
         Thus this was a question  and  answer  that  the  Judge  could  not
         ignore. (The Appellant had claimed at interview (as quoted  in  the
         letter of 6.2.14) that the cash standing to the credit of his  bank
         account in India at the date of application was money he had loaned
         to his parents, and which they had then repaid  to  him.  That  was
         also  the  oral  evidence  he  gave  to  the  Judge  under   cross-
         examination.)

     20. Ultimately therefore Mr Kannangara was  reduced  to  the  assertion
         that the Tribunal would have reached different findings of fact  on
         the disputed issue of the source of the funds relied  upon  by  the
         Appellant, had the full interview transcript been available. Simply
         put, there is no merit in this assertion. It is quite plain upon  a
         fair reading of  the  Determination  as  a  whole  that  the  Judge
         rejected the Appellant's explanation for the source of the funds in
         his bank account as inconsistent with the dates and  other  details
         of the transactions that were recorded in the statements  for  that
         bank account. The Appellant said his parents had repaid a loan that
         he had made to them in 2011, and that  this  repayment  constituted
         the funds in his bank account that he relied  upon  to  demonstrate
         that he genuinely held �50,000 at  the  date  of  the  application,
         which he genuinely intended to invest in the proposed business  (no
         such investment having yet taken place). The transactions  recorded
         in the bank statements were however of deposits of funds  into  his
         bank account by several different people over  a  period  of  three
         months, and the Judge was perfectly entitled to consider that  this
         was not consistent with the Appellant's oral evidence. It  is  also
         important to note that  the  Judge  did  not  accept  as  true  the
         Appellant's explanation of how he had come to  be  in  a  financial
         position to lend such a large sum of money to his  parents  in  the
         first place; savings he claimed to have been made from  his  salary
         earned whilst working as a social worker prior to his  most  recent
         entry to the UK. Entirely adequate reasons  were  given  for  these
         findings.

    Conclusion

     21. There was no procedural unfairness  in  the  Respondent's  decision
         making process which vitiates the decisions under appeal. There was
         no procedural unfairness in the hearing of the  Tribunal  at  first
         instance. The Appellant did not seek an adjournment of the  hearing
         of his appeal, and does not assert that the  Tribunal  should  have
         made a decision to adjourn of its  own  motion.  The  Determination
         does not disclose any material error of law in the Judge's approach
         to the evidence placed before him. The decision that the  Appellant
         had failed to establish that his was a genuine application  meeting
         the requirements of paragraph 245DD(h) was adequately reasoned  and
         well open to the Judge to make upon the evidence. That being  so  I
         dismiss the Appellant's appeal.

     22. No anonymity order was made by the Tribunal at first instance, none
         is requested on behalf of  the  Appellant  now,  and  there  is  no
         obvious reason why I should make one of my own motion.

    DECISION


         The Determination of the First Tier Tribunal which was  promulgated
         on 8 October 2014 did not involve the making of  an  error  of  law
         that requires that  decision  to  be  set  aside  and  remade.  The
         decision to dismiss the appeal is accordingly confirmed.
