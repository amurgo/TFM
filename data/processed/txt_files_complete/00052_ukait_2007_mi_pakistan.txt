Representation
For the appellant:     Mr A Mackenzie (counsel instructed by IAS)
For the respondent:    Miss K Pal, Home Office Presenting Officer

The mere fact that a person has chosen the life-style he has does  not  mean
that he is to be regarded as leading an independent life.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    This is a case where the Tribunal has  ordered  reconsideration  of  a
   decision of Immigration Judge Boyd QC, sitting at Newport  on  8  August
   2006,  a dependant's appeal by  a  citizen  of  Pakistan.  The  Tribunal
   thought the judge might have made an error of law in his  interpretation
   of the words emphasised in paragraph 298(iii) of the Rules:

      298. The requirements to be met by a person seeking  indefinite  leave
      to remain in the United Kingdom as the child of a parent, parents or a
      relative present and settled in the United Kingdom are that he:
      [nothing arises on paragraph 298(i)]
      (ii) has limited leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom, and
      (a) is under the age of 18; or
      (b) was given leave to enter or remain with a view to settlement under
      paragraph 302; and
      (iii) is not leading an independent life, is unmarried,  and  has  not
      formed an independent family unit; and
      (iv) can, and will, be accommodated adequately by the parent,  parents
      or relative the child was admitted to join, without recourse to public
      funds in accommodation which the parent, parents or relative the child
      was admitted to join, own or occupy exclusively; and
      (v) can, and will, be maintained adequately by the parent, parents  or
      relative the child was admitted to join, without  recourse  to  public
      funds.

2. This appellant at the date of  the  hearing  was  20�:  his  age  was  no
   disqualification, because he had apparently (when already 18) been  given
   leave to enter with a view to settlement under paragraph 302. So,  unlike
   the appellant in SO (Nigeria) [2007] EWCA Civ  76, he could  qualify  for
   indefinite leave to remain under paragraph 298(ii)(b) of the  Rules.  The
   judge's findings of fact and conclusions were as follows:

       24. The evidence in this appeal is that the  appellant  has  been  in
         full-time work in the UK for about two years.  He  works  full-time
         and his net take home pay according to his payslips varies  between
         about �700 and �1,000 a month. His income is deposited in  an  HSBC
         bank account in his own name. According to  his  oral  evidence  he
         hands over �500 of this income to his father so that he will not be
         tempted to waste it. Whenever he needs spending money he  asks  his
         father to let him have some and his father hands  it  over  without
         question. As I understand the arrangement  his  father  acts  as  a
         banker. Occasionally if he needed more money than he had  deposited
         with his father, his father would let him have some.
       24. The appellant lives with his parents in  Cardiff  rent  free.  He
         does not contribute to the 'household bills.'
       25. His father normally works in London, returning home every two  or
         three weeks. His mother by her tradition is unwilling to leave  the
         house without being escorted by a male family  member.  During  his
         father's absences, the appellant fulfils this role. He  also  helps
         his mother with household chores. He agreed  that  in  his  culture
         young men will often live with their  parents  until  marriage  and
         sometimes even after marriage.
       26. My assessment of the evidence  is  that  the  appellant  although
         working full-time and earning good money, chooses to live  at  home
         with his parents because this is part of his tradition. He  is  not
         financially dependent on them, nor as far as I  can  see  from  the
         evidence is he emotionally dependent on  them  any  more  than  any
         young person is emotionally dependent on his or  her  parents  well
         into the years of maturity. Indeed it appears that  his  mother  is
         more dependent on him than he is dependent on his parents.
       27. In this appeal the burden is on the appellant. I am not satisfied
         from the evidence that he is not leading  an  independent  life  as
         required by paragraph 298(iii).

3. The judge's findings of fact were of course  for  him  to  make  on  the
   circumstances of the individual  case  in  hand,  and  this  he  did  at
   paragraphs 24, 24 (bis) and 25. On the other hand, the features  of  the
   "independent life" which will disqualify an  applicant  from  benefiting
   from paragraph 298 of the Rules, as the judge found  they  did  in  this
   case at paragraphs 26 and 27, may be a matter of law. The fact that  one
   leads the life one does out of choice does not prevent it from  being  a
   dependent one: there is no requirement that the dependency must  be  one
   of necessity. The fact that one lives with one's parents as a matter  of
   custom is in my view equally irrelevant: all one need show is  that  one
   is not leading an independent life, not why.


4. While there was  at  first  sight  nothing  against  the  judge's  modus
   operandi in  analyzing  dependency  into  its  financial  and  emotional
   aspects, it may  have  distracted  him  from  the  essential  difference
   between paragraph 298(iii), where an applicant has to show  that  he  is
   not independent, and the other, more familiar provisions of  the  Rules,
   where he has to show that he is dependent. While dependency is something
   capable of analysis (on whom for what?), independence is not simply  its
   opposite. Miss Pal suggested that it was in effect defined by  paragraph
   298(iv) and (v); but this appellant was certainly being accommodated  by
   his parents, and, though he was earning his own living, I do  not  think
   that can fairly be regarded as having any more effect than removing  any
   need for his parents to subsidize him. As with the proverbial  elephant,
   it may be harder to explain what  an  "independent  life"  is,  than  to
   recognize it when one sees it. It has to be looked  at  (in  that  much-
   abused phrase) "in the round".

5. On that basis, this appellant was only 20�: he had always while in  this
   country lived in the family home, and, though he worked  full-time,  the
   judge accepted that he still handed over half or more of  his  wages  to
   his father for safe-keeping. He may have acted as the man of the  house,
   in terms of escorting his mother, while his father was  away;  but  that
   cannot  be  regarded  as  making  the  life  he  led  there,  with  her,
   independent. There may well be cases of older people who live with their
   parents simply as a matter of convenience, but that is not so here: this
   appellant was still living on the basis on which he  had  been  admitted
   for settlement, except that he was now going out  to  work.  On  what  I
   consider the right approach  to  the  "independent  life"  provision,  I
   regard the only reasonable answer in this case as  a  negative  one.  It
   follows that the appeal is allowed.
