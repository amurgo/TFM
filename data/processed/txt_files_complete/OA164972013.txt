                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mrs Pettersen, a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:    Miss Khan, instructed by Ison Harrison

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. I shall in this determination refer to the appellant as the  respondent
    and to the respondent as the appellant (as they  appeared  respectively
    before the First-tier Tribunal).  The appellant is a  citizen  of  Iran
    who was born on 21 March 1982.  She applied for  entry  to  the  United
    Kingdom as a partner under Appendix FM of HC 395  but  her  application
    was refused on 4 July 2013.  She appealed to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge Mensah) which, in a determination promulgated on 14  July  2014,
    dismissed the appeal.  The appellant now appeals, with  permission,  to
    the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The appellant's application was refused  because  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer was not satisfied that the appellant and  her  husband  (Masoud
    Rahimi) were able to meet the income requirements  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.  The judge found in favour of the appellant in respect  of  that
    reason for refusal concluding at [8] that the couple would have a total
    income of ï¿½18,600 "which meets the minimum financial  requirements  [of
    the Rules]."  What the judge failed, however, to  do  was  properly  to
    address the other ground of  refusal  namely  that  the  appellant  had
    produced insufficient evidence to satisfy the ECO that her relationship
    with her spouse was subsisting.  Both representatives before me  agreed
    that the judge appears to have believed that she  was  unable  to  take
    into  account  post-decision  evidence  to  support   the   appellant's
    assertion that she is in a subsisting  relationship  with  her  spouse.
    That evidence was extensive,  including  details  of  telephone  calls,
    internet exchanges and other written evidence.  I find that  the  judge
    has failed to apply DR (ECO: Post-Decision  Evidence)  Morocco*  [2005]
    UKIAT 00038.  She should have had regard to the post-decision  evidence
    but she failed to do so.  Her failure has  led  me  to  set  aside  her
    determination and to re-make the decision.

 3. I have considered the evidence of the subsistence of  the  relationship
    very carefully and find that it satisfied me to  the  standard  of  the
    balance of probabilities that the appellant and respondent were, at the
    date of the immigration decision, and since that date in  a  subsisting
    relationship.  In the circumstances, the appellant  satisfies  each  of
    the requirements of Appendix FM of HC 395 and in  consequence  I  allow
    her appeal against the ECO's decision.

DECISION

 4. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal  promulgated  on  14  July
    2014 is set aside.  I  have  re-made  the  decision.   The  appellant's
    appeal against the Entry Clearance Officer's decision of 14  July  2013
    is allowed under the Immigration Rules.




Signed                              Date 19 November 2014
