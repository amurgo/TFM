Representation:

Co Solicitors
For the respondent:             Mr S Whitwell, Senior Home Office
Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. Both representatives and I attended the hearing via  Skype,  while  the
    hearing was also open to attend at Field House.  The  parties  did  not
    object  to  attending  via  Skype  and  I  was   satisfied   that   the
    representatives were able to participate in the hearing.

 2. This is an appeal by the  appellant against the decision of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Brewer (the 'FtT'), promulgated on 6th November 2019, by
    which he dismissed the  appellant's  appeal  against  the  respondent's
    refusal on 27th June 2019 of her application for leave to remain on the
    basis of right to respect for her private life.  She  claimed  to  have
    entered  the  UK  on  17th  December  1998,  remained  unlawfully   but
    continuously, and applied on 28th November 2018 for leave to remain, on
    the  basis  that  it  was  less  than  28  days  until  she  had  lived
    continuously in the UK for 20  years.   She  also  referred  to  family
    members in the UK; working and not  claiming  benefits;  and  the  very
    significant obstacles to integration in her country of origin, Jamaica.



 3. The core points taken against the appellant by the respondent were that
    the appellant did not have a partner, parent or dependent  children  in
    the UK;  the  respondent  did  not  accept  her  claim  to  have  lived
    continuously in the UK for 20 years; the respondent did not accept that
    there were very significant obstacles to her integration in to Jamaica,
    where she had lived the first 30 years of her  life;  and  any  private
    life  was  established  when  she  had  no  legitimate  expectation  of
    remaining in the UK.  The appellant's family members in the UK were all
    adults who were not dependent on the appellant.

 4. The central thrust of the appellant's appeal to the First-tier Tribunal
    was  that  the  respondent  had  failed  to  consider  adequately   her
    continuous presence in the UK.

The FtT's decision

 5. The FtT found on the evidence before him that the appellant  had  lived
    continuously in the UK for more than 20 years of the  date  of  hearing
    (�� 15 and 17). The difficulty as the FtT saw it, was that at the  date
    of her application, the appellant fell short  of  satisfying  paragraph
    276ADE(1)(iii)  of  the  Immigration  Rules,  having  arrived  on  17th
    December 1998 and having applied on 28th November  2018  (�16).   As  a
    consequence, the respondent's decision to refuse  the  application  was
    correct, under the Rules.  Considering the appellant's  appeal  outside
    the Rules, at �24, the FtT noted and took into account section 117B  of
    the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and the little  weight
    to be attached to private life (albeit not no weight).  At �34, the FtT
    recorded the appellant's submission that because the appellant now  met
    the Rules, the FtT did not have to have regard to sections 117A  and  B
    of the 2002 Act, whereas the FtT concluded that as  the  appellant  did
    not meet the Rules of the time of the application, little weight should
    be given to her  private  life.   At  �35,  the  FtT  referred  to  the
    appellant deliberately overstaying in the UK unlawfully, having entered
    the UK on a 2-day visit visa;  working  illegally;  and  accessing  NHS
    services free at the point  of  delivery.  Weighing  that  against  her
    private life and taking into account Part 5A of the 2002 Act,  the  FtT
    found that the respondent's decision was  proportionate  and  dismissed
    the appellant's appeal.

The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

 6. The appellant lodged grounds of appeal, supplemented later by a witness
    statement  from  Ms  Revill,  Counsel  before  the  FtT,  as  to   what
    submissions she had made to the FtT, the gist of which was that the FtT
    had misunderstood some of her submissions, which had been  inaccurately
    recorded in the FtT's decision.

 7. The appellant accepted that she did not meet the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules at the date of her application but would have done so
    had she applied 19 days' later.  The first ground was that the FtT  had
    failed to  place  sufficient  weight  on  the  respondent's  policy  of
    granting leave to remain even where somebody had remained unlawfully in
    the UK.  The analysis of the proportionality was limited to  �35  which
    had made no reference  to  the  respondent's  policy  and  had  instead
    assumed that because the Rules were not met, long residence had no part
    to play in the proportionality assessment.

 8. The second error was in the FtT's application of section 117B(5) of the
    2002 Act, which referred to little weight  applying  to  private  life.
    The FtT had ignored the Supreme  Court  decision  in  Rhuppiah  v  SSHD
    [2018] UKSC 58 which confirmed that  these  provisions  were  normative
    guidance and may be overridden in an exceptional case, by  particularly
    strong features of the private life in question.   In  this  case,  the
    fact that the appellant had spent over 20 years in the UK by  the  time
    the hearing was such a particularly strong feature, which the  FtT  had
    ignored.

 9. In her witness statement, Ms Revill added that the submissions  to  the
    FtT had  been  that  if  the  appellant  had  not  completed  20  years
    continuous residence at the date of the hearing, she  would  not  argue
    that there were exceptional circumstances.  However, had the  appellant
    completed  20  years'  continuous  residence  this  would   amount   to
    exceptional circumstances.  She had not submitted  that  sections  117A
    and B did not apply, but was seeking to explain to  the  FtT,  how  the
    long residence and private life provisions  of  the  Immigration  Rules
    interacted with sections 117A and B of the 2002  Act  -  the  two  were
    separate.

10. First-tier Tribunal Judge Holmes granted permission on  1st  May  2020.
    The grant of permission was not limited in its scope.

The hearing before me

11. The representatives agreed in identifying the two issues before me.  In
    doing so Mr Whitwell began by indicating that he accepted  Ms  Revill's
    submission that the FtT had misunderstood her submissions  in  relation
    to the applicability of the Immigration Rules and section  117  of  the
    2002 Act and there was no need for Ms Revill to  give  evidence,  whose
    word Mr Whitwell accepted.  I was grateful to  the  professionalism  of
    both representatives in resolving the point  of  what  submissions  had
    been made to the FtT, without the necessity of having to hear evidence.

12. The appellant had accepted before the FtT that she  did  not  meet  the
    requirements of the Immigration  Rules  because  at  the  date  of  the
    application she did not have the requisite twenty years presence in the
    UK.  That necessarily meant that she sought  to  rely  upon  an  appeal
    outside the Immigration Rules and it was not the case  that  Ms  Revill
    had said there were not exceptional circumstances.   Had  she  done  so
    that would have effectively been a concession that the  appeal  had  no
    merit, when the core of this  appeal  related  to  the  assertion  that
    whilst not in compliance with the Immigration Rules, the length of  the
    period of presence, coupled with the fact  that  at  the  date  of  the
    hearing the appellant would, if she now reapplied, be granted leave  to
    remain, was that very  exceptional  circumstance  which  would  justify
    applying greater weight than little weight to her  private  life  under
    section 117B(5) of the 2002 Act.

The appellant's written submissions

13. Ms Revill relied upon her two skeleton arguments: the first dated  17th
    November 2019; and the second dated 11th August 2020.

14. In essence there were two grounds.  The first was the FtT's failure  to
    apply requisite weight to the period of time spent by the appellant  in
    the UK. Applying the authority of TZ (Pakistan) v SSHD [2018] EWCA  Civ
    1109, had the appellant applied nineteen days  later,  her  application
    would have been granted and as she continued to live in the UK  at  the
    date of the Hearing (now over 20  years),  that  should  be  positively
    determinative  of  her  article  8  claim.     That   was   the   case,
    notwithstanding that the appellant had lived here  unlawfully  and  had
    worked without permission, as the Rules acknowledged and  provided  for
    the grant of leave to remain  for  those  living  in  the  UK  in  such
    circumstances.

15. The FtT had failed to  attach  any  substantive  weight  to  that  when
    considering the proportionality of the appellant's removal. The FtT was
    obliged  to  place  considerable  weight  -  see  Rhuppiah.  That  case
    illustrated the fact that it was the length of residence, not the  date
    of the application that was  important  to  the  respondent  under  the
    twenty-year rule.

16. The second ground was that the FtT had impermissibly  regarded  himself
    as being bound to apply section 117B(5) of the  2002  Act,  namely  the
    'little weight' provision and had failed to consider  the  guidance  in
    Rhuppiah which regarded that provision as  'normative  guidance'  which
    could be overridden in exceptional circumstances.

17. In the second set of written submissions and partly in response to  the
    respondent's submissions, on the one hand, the appellant accepted  that
    there was no 'near miss' principle, following Patel  &  others  v  SSHD
    [2013] UKSC 72.  On the other hand, the  length  of  residence,  albeit
    unlawful, was relevant to the public interest  in  the  maintenance  of
    immigration control and that was  clearly  so,  bearing  in  mind  that
    proportionality  related  to  the  refusal  of  leave  to  remain   and
    consequential  removal,  and  not  the  alternative  scenario  of   the
    appellant having to reapply and pay an additional fee.

18. The appellant did not suggest that the FtT was unaware of the fact that
    the appellant had completed twenty years' residence at the date of  the
    hearing, rather that the FtT had failed to attach appropriate weight to
    it because of the FtT's misunderstanding that Ms Revill was not seeking
    to  argue  'exceptional  circumstances'.   (If  she  were  not  arguing
    exceptional circumstances outside the Immigration Rules, that would  be
    tantamount to a concession that the appeal should fail). By analogy  to
    the authority of OA & others  (human  rights;  'new  matter';  s.  120)
    Nigeria [2019] UKUT 00065 (IAC) and paragraph 276B of the Rules,  there
    was no material  distinction  between  that  case  relating  to  lawful
    residence and the appellant's circumstances.  What was common  was  the
    requirement of a certain period of residence, met at the  date  of  the
    hearing and there were no reasons why, on that basis,  the  appellant's
    appeal should not have been allowed on human rights  grounds.   Indeed,
    the Court of Appeal had observed in ZH (Bangladesh) v SSHD [2009]  EWCA
    Civ 8 that it would defeat the  purpose  of  the  predecessor  to  Rule
    (276ADE(1)(iii)), which allowed  people  to  regularise  their  status,
    based on the length of unlawful residence, if that  unlawful  residence
    itself was held against them.   There  was  no  other  reason  why  the
    application would be refused.

19. The FtT's reasoning that the appellant could  simply  reapply  was  not
    part of the original refusal decision.  The respondent  had  failed  to
    engage with the appellant's argument that in  Rhuppiah,  the  appellant
    had lived in the UK continuously for  20  years,  and  her  appeal  was
    allowed (albeit on a different basis).

20. The FtT's  analysis  was  also  flawed,  noting  the  Upper  Tribunal's
    reported decision in Birch (precarious and mistake; new matters) [2020]
    UKUT 0086 (IAC).  In particular at �24 it had stated:

         "Whatever might have been the substantive merits of the appellant's
         case before the expiry of twenty years since  her  arrival  in  the
         United Kingdom, the position now is that she meets the  substantive
         requirements of the Rules entitling her to a grant  of  leave.  For
         that reason, and that reason only, we consider that in her case  it
         would not be proportionate to remove her from the United Kingdom."

21. Returning to the second ground, the FtT's  self-direction  at  �24  was
    only partially correct.  Whilst  he  was  right  to  say  that  'little
    weight' does not mean 'no weight,' the FtT noted that he  'should  give
    little weight to private life', where �49 of Rhuppiah made  clear  that
    in an appropriate case, significantly greater weight might be attached.
     In this case it was clear that the FtT had failed to consider  he  had
    some limited flexibility afforded to him by section 117A(2)(a), see �58
    of Rhuppiah.

The respondent's written submissions

22. The respondent reiterated that there was no 'near miss' principle, see:
    Patel.   The  appellant  had  accepted  that  she  did  not  meet   the
    requirements of Rule 276ADE(iii) due to the temporal requirement  being
    tied to the date of the application.  Accordingly,  any  assessment  of
    proportionality needed to be conducted, taking into account the  public
    interest in the maintenance of effective immigration control.  The  FtT
    had been entitled to give 'little' weight pursuant to  section  117B(5)
    of the 2002 Act.  The FtT had not omitted a material consideration  and
    was well aware of the accrual of twenty years residence in the  UK,  as
    recorded at �34.

23. Whilst the appellant relied upon the authority of  OA  &  others,  that
    case was distinguishable.   OA was  concerned  with  continuous  lawful
    residence under paragraph 276B,  whereas  the  FtT  in  this  case  was
    unarguably entitled to take into account the  factors  of  overstaying;
    illegal working and using NHS  services  without  payment,  which  were
    capable of consideration in the proportionality assessment.

24. In relation to the second ground, giving  'little  weight'  to  private
    life was not contrary to the authority of Rhuppiah.  Reading the  FtT's
    decision as a whole, it was clear why the FtT had applied  the  'little
    weight' provision and it was  not  incumbent  on  the  FtT  to  provide
    reasons for not making a contrary finding.  In the circumstances, there
    was no error of law.



The appellant's oral submissions

25. Ms Revill accepted that the FtT  was  entitled  to  take  into  account
    section 117B but should  have  considered  the  weight  placed  on  the
    appellant achieving over twenty years' residence at  the  date  of  the
    hearing.  When I asked her, Ms Revill went as far as to say that absent
    of any suitability issue, living in the UK continuously  for  at  least
    twenty years at the date of  the  hearing,  was  determinative  of  the
    appellant's appeal by reference to human rights.  The FtT's analysis at
    ��34 and 35 of his decision had failed to take this into  account.   By
    analogy to the authority of OA, the respondent could not point  to  the
    maintenance of effective immigration control as having  weight  in  the
    proportionality assessment, as reflected in paragraph 276ADE(1)(iii) of
    the Rules, when, if she were to reapply now,  the  appellant  would  be
    granted leave to remain. The historic unlawfulness of  the  appellant's
    residence  in  the  UK  could  not  be  a  material   factor   in   the
    proportionality assessment.  Whilst it was said  that  the  Birch  case
    could be distinguished (Ms Birch had been the victim of  deception  and
    had attempted to regularise her status), Ms Birch's circumstances  were
    arguably weaker because she had applied  for  leave  to  remain  for  a
    number  of  different  reasons  over  the  years  and  her  appeal  was
    subsequently allowed solely (noting �24 of that decision)  because  the
    length of time she had lived in the UK would make refusal of  leave  to
    remain disproportionate.  In relation to the second ground, the 'little
    weight' provisions could apply in principle but the FtT had  failed  to
    consider flexibility and his discretion  to  apply  greater  weight  in
    exceptional circumstances.

The respondent's oral submissions

26. Mr Whitwell submitted that the  FtT's  decision  could  not  fairly  be
    framed solely as a dismissal of  the  appeal  on  the  basis  that  the
    appellant was nineteen days' short of twenty years.  The rationale  for
    the FtT's dismissal of the appeal was at ��34 and 35 and distilled down
    to an analysis of the public interest features in  the  proportionality
    assessment.  Mr Whitwell accepted that if I were to  conclude  that  an
    acquisition of twenty years' continuous residence, at the date  of  the
    FtT's hearing, was determinative  of  the  proportionality  assessment,
    then  the  FtT's  decision  was  clearly  wrong,  but  it  was  not  so
    determinative.   Paragraph  276ADE(1)(iii)  of  the  Rules  imposed   a
    temporal requirement which tied into the date of  the  application,  as
    opposed to the hearing, in contrast to paragraph 276B, and the tie back
    to the date of the application would otherwise be meaningless.  The FtT
    had considered that the appellant  had  met  the  requirements  of  the
    length of residence  at  the  hearing,  but,  crucially,  was  entitled
    nevertheless to take into account  three  countervailing  factors:  the
    appellant's almost immediate and deliberate  overstaying,  after  being
    granted a two-day visit visa; her working illegally; and accessing  NHS
    services free, to which she was not  entitled.   All  were  permissible
    factors to take into account in the proportionality assessment.

27. I should treat the cases of OA and Birch as  fact  sensitive.   In  the
    case of Birch, she initially had leave to enter and had been  genuinely
    deceived.  Judge Blundell had said in Rhuppiah that he was required  to
    apply section 117B of the 2002 Act, but the FtT in this case recognised
    that the 'little weight' provision was not a fixed quality.  The  Court
    in �49 of Rhuppiah had spoken about the small degree of flexibility and
    that was exactly what, when taken in context, the FtT had applied.

The appellant's oral response

28. In brief response, Ms Revill added that the key point here was that  if
    the appellant applied now, she would be granted leave  to  remain.   It
    was correct to say that the FtT had not refused the application  merely
    because the appellant was 19 days short of the 20 years at the date  of
    the application, but what the FtT had not done was to engage  with  the
    flexibility of the 'little weight' provision, at ��34 and 35.

Discussion and conclusions

29. I conclude that the FtT did not err in law.  First, I am satisfied that
    the FtT correctly reminded himself at ��34 and 35 that  his  assessment
    of proportionality required 'balancing the rights protected by  Article
    8 against the public interest' (�34) and that the approach was now  set
    out in sections 117A to D of the 2002 Act.  Whilst I  accept  that  the
    FtT misunderstood Ms Revill to have submitted that  the  appellant  now
    met the Rules and so the FtT did not need to consider  those  sections,
    that was not material, as the FtT did then  go  on  to  consider  those
    sections.

30. Dealing with the grounds in reverse order, I accept  the  force  of  Mr
    Whitwell's submission that when read in context, the FtT's reasoning at
    ��34 to 35 was  a  full  and  appropriate  proportionality  assessment,
    balancing  the  public  interest  in  the  maintenance   of   effective
    immigration control versus the appellant's article 8 rights.   The  FtT
    noted (and was entitled to note)  the  period  of  time  spent  by  the
    appellant in the UK and while applying the 'little  weight'  provision'
    of section 117B(5), unarguably then went beyond this  to  consider  the
    wider proportionality assessment, and so recognised the flexibility  of
    how section 117B(5) ought to be  applied.  That  was  the  reason  why,
    having referred to that provision at the  end  of  �34,  the  FtT  then
    immediately went on to consider not just the fact  of  the  appellant's
    overstaying, but her deliberate intention  in  doing  so;  her  working
    illegally; and having accessed free NHS services. The FtT weighed these
    factors against the appellant's private life (�35).   In  summary,  the
    FtT did not simply reason that  by  virtue  of  falling  short  of  the
    required period of presence, little weight was given to the appellant's
    private life, and therefore her  appeal  failed;  there  was  a  fuller
    analysis, in which the FtT considered the length of presence in the  UK
    and the three countervailing factors.

31. Dealing finally with the first ground, I  do  not  accept  Ms  Revill's
    submission that  absent  any  suitability  issues,  that  a  fact  that
    somebody has lived in the UK for at least 20 years by  the  time  of  a
    hearing is determinative of a human rights appeal, by  analogy  to  the
    long residence provisions under OA or an application of TZ  (Pakistan).
    I reject this for the following reasons. First, paragraph 276B does not
    import a similar requirement of length of continuous residence  at  the
    date of the application itself and indeed the respondent permits  early
    applications, as reflected in  its  policy  on  Long  Residence.   This
    contrasts with paragraph 276ADE(1)(iii), which ties  back  specifically
    to the date of the application.  I accept Mr Whitwell's submission that
    to treat as determinative the period of presence  at  the  hearing,  by
    analogy to OA would otherwise render  the  link  to  the  date  of  the
    application meaningless.    Second, it ignores the function of  section
    117B(5), which, as Rhuppiah  makes  clear,  is  to  provide  'normative
    guidance,' but  which  nevertheless  permits  cases  with  particularly
    strong features to succeed  (�49).   Were  Ms  Revill's  submission  to
    succeed, the reverse would apply, with the fact of continuous  presence
    imposing the very straight-jacket that the Supreme Court had counselled
    against.  Instead, what the FtT was entitled to do (and  sections  117A
    and B permit) is to weigh up all of the factors in  the  round  in  the
    proportionality assessment, including when someone has lived in the  UK
    for at least 20 years. Such an assessment may include consideration, as
    in the appellant's case, of access to NHS services free at the point of
    delivery, when there was no entitlement.   There may  be  a  number  of
    other factors, including financial independence, in section 117B  which
    remain relevant.  In the  circumstances  of  this  case,  the  FtT  was
    unarguably  entitled  to   take   into   account   the   countervailing
    circumstances, in refusing the appellant's appeal.

32. As an aside (and not relevant to the issue  of  whether  there  was  an
    error of law), it remains unclear why the  appellant's  legal  advisors
    regarded it as appropriate to make the application on  the  appellant's
    behalf, before the appellant had lived in the UK for at least 20 years,
    such a short period before the appellant reached that  anniversary  and
    did not instead wait three weeks.  It may be  that  those  subsequently
    reviewing the legal advice conclude that  the  advisors'  actions  were
    professionally negligent, with the result that it  is  not  appropriate
    for the appellant (as opposed to her advisor's insurers)  to  bear  the
    costs of a renewed application, but I am conscious that I am not  privy
    to the legally privileged advice given to the appellant and that it  is
    a matter for her to take up with them  and  any  relevant  professional
    regulatory body.

Conclusion

33. I conclude that there are no  material  errors  of  law  in  the  FtT's
    decision. Therefore, the appellant's challenge  fails,  and  the  FtT's
    decision shall stand.
