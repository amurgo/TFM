For the Appellants:    Mr C Mannan (Counsel)
For the Respondent:    Mr Avery (Home office presenting officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   This matter comes before me for consideration  as  to  whether  or  not
    there is a material error of law in the decision made by the First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Hussain), who in a decision and reasons promulgated  on
    30 December 2014 dismissed the appeals of both  appellants   against  a
    refusal under Tier 1 (Entrepreneurs)  points-based  scheme  immigration
    rules.

2.   The first appellant is a citizen of Pakistan and the  second  appellant
    is a citizen of India.  They appealed against a decision  made  by  the
    respondent on 23 June 2014 following their joint application  submitted
    on 30 May 2014.

Reasons for refusal

3.   In a Reasons for Refusal Letter  dated  23  June  2014  the  respondent
    considered that the appellants failed to meet Appendix A  -  attributes
    with reference to provision (d)  in  the  first  row  of  Table  4  and
    paragraph 245DD(b).  The appellants claimed to have access  to  ï¿½50,000
    from a third party.  They provided evidence of a bank letter  from  the
    Bank of Punjab, a declaration from Mohammed Shameen Ahmed and a  letter
    from  Salam  Law  Associates.   The  respondent  considered  that   the
    documentary evidence was inadequate and failed to meet the requirements
    of the specified evidence under paragraph 41-SD. The  bank  letter  did
    not state that the institution was aware  of  the  third  party  having
    promised to make the money available  to  another  person.   The  third
    party  declaration  was  not  signed  by  both  applicants.  The  legal
    representative's declaration confirming the third party signatures  did
    not confirm the signatures of the appellants.  Furthermore, as evidence
    of active trading, the appellants provided a photocopy  of  a  contract
    between their business and FBC.Co was not signed  on  every  page.  The
    respondent, in  a letter dated 10  June  2014,  requested  the  correct
    documents to be  provided  by  19  June  2014.  The  further  documents
    produced were not acceptable.

First-tier Tribunal

4.   The appeals were initially listed for hearing on separate  dates  (19th
    November 2014 and 15th January 2015). Following a request made  by  the
    appellants on 16th October 2014 for the hearings to be listed  together
    on 15th January, the Tribunal linked the appeals and listed the hearing
    for 19th November. It was a  joint  application  and  the  reasons  for
    refusal were identical. Notice of hearing was sent to both  appellants,
    albeit to the second appellant (SM) with very short notice of one  week
    and the hearing date was brought forward by two months.

5.    At  the  hearing  on  19th  November  Counsel,  instructed   by   both
    appellants, made an application for an adjournment on the grounds  that
    the second appellant had had insufficient time in which to prepare  his
    appeal; his file had not been made available to his new solicitors from
    his previous representatives and  he  did  not  have  the  respondent's
    bundle.

6.   In refusing the application the Tribunal had regard to  the  fact  that
    notice of hearing had been issued to the first appellant only one  week
    before the hearing date.  The  Tribunal  noted  that  the  reasons  for
    refusal for both appellants were identical in that there was a  failure
    to meet the specified evidence Rules paragraph 41-SD [5]. The  Tribunal
    found that in reality there was little  disadvantage  suffered  by  the
    first  appellant  notwithstanding  that  his  representatives  had  not
    obtained the previous file and had no  respondent's  bundle  [9].   The
    Tribunal made available the respondent's bundle for Counsel  and he was
    then given time in which to peruse the same. In reaching  its  decision
    the Tribunal  relied  on  the  exceptions  under  Section  85A  of  the
    Nationality, Asylum  and  Immigration  Act  2002  ("2002  Act"),  which
    limited evidence that could be taken into account by the Tribunal under
    points-based scheme appeals.  There was no argument that the appellants
    sought to obtain new evidence and it did not appear to  be  denied   in
    the witness statement that the applications did  not   meet  the  Rules
    [14].

Grounds of Application

7.   The first appellant argued that the  refusal  to  adjourn  the  hearing
    amounted to a procedural error in law  such  that  he  was  effectively
    denied the right to a fair hearing.  Further, it was  argued  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal failed to engage with further  documents  (items  D
    and E) provided by the appellants following the  request  made  in  the
    letter dated 10 June 2014.  The Tribunal erred by failing  to  reach  a
    conclusion without considering all of the available evidence.

Permission

8.   Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  P  J  G
    White who had regard to the circumstances set out  in  the  grounds  of
    appeal at paragraphs a-e  of  the  permission.   In  paragraph  (f)  he
    stated:

         "In all the circumstances, it  is  arguable  that  the  refusal  to
         adjourn has led to a denial of the right to a fair hearing  of  the
         appellants' appeals so as to amount to an error of law (see Nwaigwe
         (Adjournment: fairness) [2014] UKUT 00418 (IAC))."

Error of Law Hearing

9.    Both  appellants  attended  the  hearing.   They  had  instructed  new
    representatives and were represented by Mr  C  Mannan  of  Counsel.   A
    bundle for the hearing was served by way of a fax dated 20 April  2015.
    The bundle had not been served on  the  respondent.   Submissions  were
    made by both parties. At the end of the hearing I reserved my  decision
    which I now give with my reasons.  I indicated to the parties  that  in
    the event of finding any error of law it would be appropriate  for  the
    matter to be reheard. Otherwise I proposed  to  deal  with  the  matter
    without further hearing.

Submissions

10.  Mr Mannan contended that there were two issues,  firstly  the  fairness
    of refusal of the adjournment and secondly the evidence in  support  of
    the appeal.  Mr Mannan outlined the procedural history set out  in  the
    grounds of appeal with regard to the  adjournment  issue.   As  to  the
    second issue, he submitted  that  it  was  unclear  what  material  the
    Tribunal had considered in terms of the response to the letter dated 10
    June 2014.  The appellants had now produced a  certificate  of  postage
    for a letter dated 17 June 2014 attached to which were  three  separate
    documents.  It was  unclear  whether  this  evidence  had  either  been
    considered by the Tribunal or was in the respondent's bundle, which the
    appellant did not have. Mr Mannan submitted that the material sent with
    the letter dated 17 June  conclusively  dealt  with  the  three  issues
    raised in the refusal letter.   As  to  the   failure  to  provide  the
    original contract (which had now been provided), it was argued that the
    letter dated 10 June was unclear as it failed specifically to draw  the
    appellants' attention to the failure to provide the original contract.

11.  Mr Avery clarified that the position  when  the  appellants  originally
    submitted their applications the documents listed as E  and  F  in  the
    Secretary of State's  bundle  had  not  been  provided.  This  prompted
    respondent's letter dated 10 June 2014.  The appellants  then  produced
    documents E and F which were respectively  dated  26  May  and  23  May
    (postdating the appellants' application dated 21 May).  Mr Avery argued
    that the respondent was under no obligation to identify defects in  the
    material provided.  The respondent's letter dated 10 June informed that
    photocopies were not adequate and that originals  should  be  provided.
    The letter dated 17th June (together with enclosures) were not received
    by the respondent.  The respondent's bundle contained all the  evidence
    that was put before the Tribunal. In the event that  further  documents
    were sent or delivered, it was clear that  they  were  not  before  the
    Tribunal and therefore could not contribute to any error of law.

12.   As  regards  the  adjournment  issue  Mr  Avery  submitted  that  both
    appellants were represented by the same solicitors and whilst accepting
    that the first appellant's appeal had been brought forward to be  heard
    within a relatively short timescale, in light  of  the  fact  that  the
    circumstances for both appellants were identical, it remained difficult
    to  see  how  the  appellant  could  be  disadvantaged.  There  was  no
    disadvantage to either appellant and the refusal of the adjournment was
    not material to the outcome.  Mr Avery  submitted  that  the  assertion
    that documents were sent on 17 June should be treated with a degree  of
    scepticism, particularly given that the bank documents provided were in
    an amended form meeting concerns raised in the letter dated 20 June.

13.  Mr Mannan relied on the certificate of posting.  He contended  that  by
    23 June the appellants had  provided  at  least  75%  of  the  material
    capable of meeting the requirements.   The  respondent  ought  to  have
    pointed out to the appellants that the original contract was required.





Discussion and Decision

14.  I consider the guidance in Nwaigwe (Adjournment: fairness) [2014]  UKUT
    00418 (IAC).  I am  satisfied  that  the  Tribunal  justly  and  fairly
    considered the circumstances  of both appellants and found  in  reality
    that  there  was  no  disadvantage  suffered   by   either    appellant
    notwithstanding that the second appellant had  not  obtained  his  file
    from solicitors previously instructed and had no  respondent's  bundle.
    The Tribunal made the respondent's bundle available to  the  appellants
    and his representative who was acting jointly for both  appellants  and
    was given the opportunity to peruse the same. There was  no  unfairness
    to the  appellants  in  this  regard.  Counsel's  withdrawal  from  the
    proceedings after the refusal of the adjournment was as a result of the
    appellants taking a clear decision to that effect. I find this a little
    odd in light of the fact that Counsel was instructed to represent  both
    appellants and the application for an adjournment was instigated by the
    second appellant.  There was no argument  raised  before  the  Tribunal
    that the first appellant, whose appeal hearing had always  been  listed
    for November, required further  time  in  which  to  prepare.   As  the
    application and appeal were jointly made, I  am  satisfied  that  there
    could be no real disadvantage to the second appellant, given  that  his
    case was identical to that of the first appellant. In any  event  I  am
    satisfied that the appellants understood the reasons  for  refusal  and
    were sent letters which confirmed the outstanding issues  to  be  dealt
    with at the hearing.  The Tribunal had in mind that the application for
    adjournment was in the main based on the need for  additional  time  to
    obtain the file of papers from the previous solicitors.

15.    In considering  the  application  the  Tribunal  properly  took  into
    account the issues in the appeal and the  application  of  Exception  2
    Section 85A of the 2002 Act. Having  taken  into  account  the  matters
    raised and considering the same in light of the guidance in  Nwaigwe  I
    am satisfied that there was no unfairness leading to an error  of  law,
    following the refusal to adjourn.  The Tribunal's decision was entirely
    fair and compatible with the overriding objective in Rule  2  (Tribunal
    Procedure Rules 2014) and the parties  obligation  to  cooperate.   The
    Tribunal  took  into  account  all  material  considerations  and   the
    appellants were not denied a fair hearing.

16.  I find no merit in the second  ground.   The  Tribunal  considered  the
    evidence put before it included in the  respondent's  bundle  to  which
    both parties and their representative had access. No issue  was  raised
    before the Tribunal that further evidence was sent in letter  dated  17
    June 2015, which was not before the Tribunal. This  was  not  an  issue
    raised specifically in the grounds of appeal but was  introduced at the
    hearing before me in a letter dated 20 April  2015  which  had  neither
    been  served  on  the  respondent  or  in  accordance  with  the  Upper
    Tribunal's standard directions.

17.  The appellants failed to  meet  the  requirements  to  establish  third
    party funding under paragraph 41-SD(c) and (d)  of  Appendix  A.   They
    were subsequently contacted by the  respondent  and  asked  to  produce
    further documents; they were reminded of the requirement  for  original
    documents  to  be  produced.   The  appellants  instructed   solicitors
    throughout and the decision taken for  Counsel  to  withdraw  from  the
    hearing was a clear choice  made  by  the  appellants.   There  was  no
    unfairness created by the Tribunal. The burden is a  on  appellants  to
    make and to prepare  their  application  and  to  submit  all  relevant
    documents in accordance with the  requirements  of  the  Rules  and  to
    pursue their appeal.  I am satisfied that the Tribunal  considered  all
    the relevant evidence in reaching its decision.

Notice of Decision
