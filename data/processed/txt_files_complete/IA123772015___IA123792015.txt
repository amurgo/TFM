                            DECISION AND REASONS

    These are appeals from a decision on both cases  by  Judge  Saad  Meah,
    sitting at Taylor House on 27 March 2016.  Mr and Mrs Barnett were both
    born in India, and in September 2012 both of them were  given  multiple
    entry visit visas for five years. On 28 March 2015  they  arrived  here
    and requested leave to enter for five months to  visit  their  son  and
    daughter, both settled in this country.

2.    The  respondent  refused  the  appellants  leave  to  enter,  as   the
    Immigration Rules by this time  required  that  they  should  "...  not
    intend to live in the UK  for  extended  periods  through  frequent  or
    successive visits".  They had spent a long time here in 2007  to  2012,
    and had spent 21ï¿½ out of 29 months here since 2012. Between January and
    March 2014, during which time they were staying in India, they made  an
    application for settlement visas, which was refused.

3.   The  judge  dealt  with  the  case  under  paragraph  41  (ii)  of  the
    Immigration Rules, as it had previously stood, requiring  only  that  a
    visitor "intends to leave the United Kingdom at the end of  the  period
    of the visit as stated by him"; but  he  did  not  note  the  provision
    relied on by the respondent which now follows it. If he  has  available
    to him the current (9th) edition of Phelan and Gillespie's  Immigration
    Law Handbook, he will see (p 663) that it was  inserted  from  6  April
    2013, subject to savings for applications made before then,  which  the
    applications for leave to enter in this case were not.

4.   The judge's decision may well provide a perfectly  satisfactory  answer
    to the question of whether these  appellants  intended  to  leave  this
    country at the end of their visit; but not to the question posed by the
    version of the Immigration Rules which  he  should  have  been  dealing
    with.

Respondent's appeal allowed

Direction for same judge to resume the hearing and answer the question.

                                                                       [pic]
