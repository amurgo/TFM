                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  with  permission  by  the
    Appellant with permission granted by  Judge  Storey  on  21st  November
    2018.  It relates to a Decision of First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Mitchell
    promulgated on 26th  June  2018  where  he  dismissed  the  Appellant's
    appeal, the Appellant being a citizen of Jamaica born in 1989.  He  had
    made an application for further leave to remain as the  spouse  of  his
    British wife.  His wife was born  and  raised  in  the  United  Kingdom
    although she is of Jamaican heritage.

 2.  The  Secretary  of  State  had  refused  the  application  firstly  on
    suitability grounds because the  Appellant  had  failed  to  mention  a
    conviction in his application and secondly on  eligibility  grounds  on
    the basis that one piece of specified evidence  was  not  included,  in
    that the employer's letter did not state how long the Sponsor had  been
    earning her current earnings.

 3. The Secretary of State also found that the provisions of Ex.1  or  Ex.2
    did not apply. They do not apply where an applicant does not  meet  the
    suitability grounds.

 4. The Judge considered first the suitability  ground.   He  accepted  the
    explanations given by both the Appellant and his wife that they did not
    realise a community penalty amounted to a "conviction".  He  found  the
    matter to be finely balanced but gave the Appellant the benefit of  the
    doubt and found the omission to be mistaken but not dishonest.

 5. In considering the other issue the Judge accepted that the relationship
    was genuine.  He accepted that the Appellant was credible, as  was  his
    wife.  He accepted save for that one conviction that the Appellant  has
    no criminal record.  He found that the Appellant's wife's earnings,  at
    ï¿½40,000, were well above the income threshold.  The Judge  nevertheless
    found it not a disproportionate breach of  his  right  to  private  and
    family life to dismiss the appeal.

 6. Ms Ferguson argued before me that in a case such as  this  where  quite
    clearly the finances are there, inadequate weight was given to the fact
    that  substantively  they  meet  the  Rules  and  that  would  make  it
    disproportionate to dismiss the appeal.

 7. I agree with her that the judge  has  erred  in  his  consideration  of
    Article 8 and proportionality in  particular.  In  this  case,  on  the
    Judge's findings, all  the  provisions  of  the  Rules  could  be  met,
    although they were not at  the  time  of  application  because  of  the
    missing evidence.  In terms of s.117B the Appellant speaks English,  he
    is not a burden on society and the couple are financially  independent.
    The Appellant had previous leave to remain as a spouse. Although  there
    are no insurmountable obstacles, there are potential  difficulties  for
    the wife to relocate to Jamaica.

Decision

 8. I therefore set aside the Decision.

 9. I also note that the judge has strayed beyond his remit  in  suggesting
    that the Secretary  of  State  should  allow  him  to  make  a  further
    application for leave to remain from within  the  United  Kingdom  even
    though his leave has lapsed.  If the judge felt that to be appropriate,
    then that would have been a reason to allow the appeal.

10. Because the judge's reasoning is flawed in respect of his consideration
    of Article 8 I cannot find that it is not flawed in his  consideration
    of the suitability point either.

11. I therefore set aside the Decision in its entirety because all  matters
    need to be redecided.  It was agreed by both representatives  that  the
    appropriate way forward is for the case to be remitted  to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal for a full rehearing of all matters before a judge  other
    than Judge Mitchell.  The appropriate hearing centre is Taylor House.

No anonymity direction is made.
