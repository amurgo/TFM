                                     and

                   The Entry Clearance Officer in Jakarta
                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant: Mr J Walsh, Counsel
For the Secretary of State:  Ms T Hart, HOPO


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The claimant is a national of the Philippines who appeals against  the
      decision of an adjudicator,  Mr  CB  Kealy,  following  a  hearing  on
      12 February 2003 dismissing the claimant's appeal against the decision
      of the Entry Clearance Officer refusing his application for  leave  to
      enter the United Kingdom for the purposes of settlement as the son  of
      Mrs Leticia Ramada who has indefinite leave to remain here.

   2. The claimant was born on 4 August 1984.  He is now 18 years old.   His
      mother, Leticia, formed a relationship  with  the  claimant's  father,
      also called Dominador Ramada, in 1971.  She  had  five  sons  by  him.
      Jubilito, Ruel (now aged 25), Rolando, the claimant and  Darlit,  born
      23 June 1989, aged 14.  The relationship with  the  claimant's  father
      broke down.  The mother has always claimed that this  was  because  of
      his brutal and drunken behaviour.

   3. In 1991, the claimant's mother left the Philippines in order  to  find
      work.  At that time, the claimant  was  aged  seven  and  his  younger
      brother was only two years old.   Eventually,  she  travelled  to  the
      United Kingdom.  From the time of her arrival until 2000,  she  worked
      as a domestic help. On 2 June 2000, she was granted indefinite leave
      to remain in the United Kingdom. In the same  year,  she  married  her
      present husband and now works for him in his shop.  They have a  house
      in Kenton.  On being granted leave to remain, the claimant was able to
      travel freely to and from Manila.  Within a short time of  the  grant,
      she travelled to Manila for the first time since 1991.

   4. When the claimant left the Philippines, all of the  children  remained
      there.  The claimant had made arrangements for them to be looked after
      by her mother and other family members.  The  claimant's  father  soon
      formed a relationship with another woman but continued to live in  the
      same building as the children and the other relatives.  At first,  the
      principal carer  was  the  claimant's  maternal  grandmother  and  her
      cousin, Romanita and Romanita's niece, Gillian.

   5. The claimant's mother carried out her intention to use her  income  to
      support the children in the Philippines.  A large  proportion  of  her
      income was returned home.  Various members of  the  family,  including
      the children's father, were selected by the claimant  to  receive  the
      funds.  In 1999, however, the mother had ceased to send money  to  the
      father. By 1998, Ruel was aged about 24 and had married.   He  appears
      to have assumed the role of exercising  prime  responsibility  in  the
      household in the Philippines.

   6. In 1994 or 1995, the claimant's mother purchased a house in which  the
      claimant's father and his new family occupied the ground floor and the
      claimant and his younger brother lived with Ruel and his wife  in  one
      of the upper floors.  One of the other sons and his wife and  children
      occupied the other upper floor.  Each of the families  had  their  own
      entrance and kitchen facilities but all shared a communal WC.

   7. On 23 August 2001, when the claimant was aged 17, an  application  was
      made for entry clearance.  A similar, but  separate,  application  was
      made in relation to Darlit.  The claimant had finished school  at  the
      age of 15 and has remained unemployed since.  He continued to live  in
      the same house,  divided  as  it  appears  to  have  been  into  three
      households but with a considerable amount of interchange  between  all
      the occupants.  The claimant's father and stepmother did the  cooking.
      See the answers to question 64 and 65 in the interview.  The  claimant
      shared a bedroom with his younger brother.  The claimant's grandmother
      was also the house.  The house has electricity, running  water  and  a
      television.  In paragraph 2.6 of his  determination,  the  adjudicator
      refers to the claimant being close to his father.

   8. In May 2002, a month before  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  made  his
      decision, Ruel and  his  family  moved  to  Cebu,  in  the  provinces,
      accompanied by the claimant and his younger brother.  Another  brother
      lived nearby.  Both of the properties  had  been  purchased  from  the
      funds provided by the claimant's mother.  In 2002,  for  example,  the
      claimant's mother had provided the sum of �4,500, sufficient to enable
      Ruel to purchase the claimant's present home.

   9. It is apparent that the claimant has been well looked after  by  these
      various members of his family since 1991, a  period  of  about  twelve
      years.  He lives in exactly similar circumstances to  his  other  four
      brothers.  If this appeal fails, he will  continue  to  live  in  what
      appears to be relatively comfortable  circumstances.   He  is  now  an
      adult.  His mother has carried out, to the full,  the  commitment  she
      assumed in 1991 when she left the family in order to work  abroad  and
      earn sufficient income to support them far more comfortably  then  she
      could reasonably  have  hoped  to  achieve  in  the  Philippines.   In
      paragraph 2.5 of the  determination,  the  adjudicator  describes  the
      accommodation in which the family lived in 1991 as a rented house in a
      squatter area of Manila.  Contrast that with  the  position  now.   At
      least two of the sons have  homes  of  their  own,  purchased  by  the
      mother, in the provinces.  Two of his brothers  work,  or  worked,  as
      tricycle drivers. There does not appear to be any explanation why  the
      claimant does not work.

  10. Under paragraph 297 of HC 395, the Immigration Rules, the requirements
      to be met by a person seeking indefinite leave  to  enter  the  United
      Kingdom as the child  of  a  parent  settled  in  the  United  Kingdom
      includes the requirements in paragraphs 297 (i) (d), (e) and (f):

          "(d)  one parent is present and settled in the United Kingdom  and
          the other parent is dead; or

         e) one parent is present and settled in the United Kingdom ... and
            has had sole responsibility for the child's upbringing; or

         f)  one parent ... is present and settled in  the  United  Kingdom
            ... and there  are  serious  and  compelling  family  or  other
            circumstances which made exclusion of the child undesirable and
            suitable arrangements have been made for the child's care

  11. These are alternative provisions.  It is sufficient  if  the  claimant
      establishes one of the requirements.  That said, given the facts as we
      have set them out above, it is clear that  there  are  no  serious  or
      compelling family or other circumstances that  render  the  claimant's
      exclusion from the United Kingdom undesirable.

  12. The claimant approaches the application by seeking to  establish  that
      she has had sole responsibility for the claimant's upbringing.  It has
      been said that the phrase is intended to reflect the  situation  where
      the chief parental responsibility for the child's upbringing rests  to
      all intents and purposes with one parent.  The  parent  claiming  sole
      responsibility must satisfactorily demonstrate that she has  been  the
      chief person exercising responsibility.  It has long  been  recognised
      that sole responsibility cannot be  interpreted  too  literally.   See
      Emmanuel v SSHD [1972] Imm AR 69.  Where a parent leaves  a  child  in
      order to live and work elsewhere, it is inevitable  that  the  child's
      day-to-day care will be entrusted  to  another  person.   That  person
      will, as a matter of fact, have some responsibility for the welfare of
      the child.  Depending on  the  child's  age,  that  responsibility  is
      likely to include providing food and clean clothes as well as ensuring
      that the child gets up in the morning, goes to school and goes to  bed
      at night.  Where the carer is paid for his services by the parent,  it
      is easy to see that the  parent  himself  is  continuing  to  exercise
      responsibility, albeit vicariously through the  actions  of  the  paid
      worker.  It is neither necessary nor usual for the carer  to  be  paid
      for his services.  In most  cases,  the  person  responsible  for  the
      child's day-to-day care will  be  a  relative  who  does  not  receive
      payment although, as in the present case, the family as  a  whole  may
      benefit from remittances from the parent abroad.

  13. In Nmaju v Entry Clearance Officer [2001] INLR 26, the Court of Appeal
      considered the case of a mother whose children were  looked  after  by
      their father when she  came  to  the  United  Kingdom  in  1988  until
      September 1996 when the father refused to continue to look  after  the
      children  and  left  them.   Thereafter,  from  September  1996  until
      November 1996 when entry clearance  was  refused,  the  children  were
      looked after by a maid paid for by the mother.  The  Court  of  Appeal
      focused upon the period of 2 � months when the mother indisputably had
      sole  responsibility  for  the  children's  upbringing.   During  this
      crucial period, there could only be two contenders for the role of the
      person with sole responsibility.  It was the mother's  paid  employee,
      acting under the mother's express directions, or  it  was  the  mother
      herself.  Not surprisingly, the Court of Appeal decided  that  it  was
      the mother who had sole responsibility, rather  than  the  maid.   The
      Court of Appeal emphasised that the  period  of  sole  responsibility,
      although short, did not disqualify the mother.

  14. In Ramos (Suzara) v Immigration Appeal Tribunal [1989] Immigration  AR
      148, (considered in paragraph 8 in Nmaju), Dillon LJ referred  to  the
      fact that the direction and control of upbringing  are  factors  which
      are part of the total pattern of facts on which the adjudicator has to
      make his decision.  Another matter  was,  of  course,  the  extent  of
      contact.  In the present case, of course, the fact that the mother was
      probably not able to return to the  Philippines  until  the  grant  of
      Indefinite Leave to Remain negatives any inference that might be drawn
      from the fact that she did not visit the  children  between  1991  and
      2000.  Importantly, Dillon LJ said:

        "... the decision that  has  been  made  is  the  decision  of  the
        adjudicator.  It is not for  this  court  to  make  its  own  fresh
        decision of fact on the evidence as it  appears  from  the  papers.
        That is not the function on judicial review."

  15. In R v Immigration Appeal Tribunal, ex p. Mahmood [1988] Imm AR121, (a
      copy of which was provided to us), Roch J considered  the  case  of  a
      child who had been supported by the sponsor, his legal guardian.   The
      sponsor was divorced from the child's mother.  The child  first  lived
      with his mother and then with  the  sponsor's  mother.   The  Tribunal
      concluded that from that time the sponsor's mother and  an  uncle  had
      shared responsibility with the sponsor for the applicant's upbringing.
       The court found that financial support and  legal  guardianship  were
      factors to be taken into account but that they  were  not  conclusive.
      It was for the adjudicator to consider whether the sponsor parent  can
      fairly be said to have remained ultimately  in  sole  control  of  the
      child's upbringing.  On the facts of that  case,  the  nature  of  the
      shared responsibility did not amount to sole  responsibility  and  the
      child failed to meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules.

  16. There was very little evidence before the adjudicator in  relation  to
      ultimate responsibility.  In his interview,  the  claimant  was  asked
      about who decided that the claimant cease schooling at the age of  15.
      In answer to question 28, the claimant said that  he  had  decided  it
      himself. When he had  told  his  mother  about  his  decision,  it  is
      apparent that she was angry.  See the answer to  question  36.   Since
      then, the  claimant  has  remained  unemployed  and  there  is  little
      additional evidence of the exercise of responsibility over him.

  17. The adjudicator clearly accepted,  as  we  do,  that  the  mother  has
      transmitted significant amounts of money to her family in Manila.  The
      adjudicator was entitled to infer that other family members were  also
      earning and injecting funds into the  family.   The  adjudicator  also
      found that the father played some part in  the  household,  in  common
      with other members of the claimant's family.  He also  accepted  that,
      for some years, the father has not  been  entrusted  to  handle  funds
      provided by the mother.  In  particular,  since  the  time  when  Ruel
      demonstrated sufficient maturity,  it  has  been  Ruel  who  has  been
      permitted to handle funds from the United Kingdom, as well  as  having
      the day-to-day care of the claimant in his home.

  18. It seems to us that the adjudicator came to the correct conclusion  in
      paragraph 7.3 of the determination when he found that the  mother  was
      but one  of  several  people  who  exercised  responsibility  for  the
      claimant and his younger brother.  The adjudicator did not attempt  to
      belittle the role played by the mother in  financing  the  family  but
      decided that the  actual  responsibility  for  the  younger  children,
      including the claimant, has remained firmly in Manila and that she had
      not taken any greater degree of responsibility in  more  recent  years
      save that when her own financial circumstances improved, she was  able
      to send out greater sums of money.  He concluded  that  there  was  no
      evidence that the  mother  took  the  important  decisions  about  the
      younger children's upbringing  because  her  involvement  was  largely
      confined  to  gathering  wealth.   He  categorised  her  post-decision
      rehousing of the two elder  boys as being entirely consistent with her
      previous conduct.

  19. We agree with the adjudicator's approach to the consideration of  sole
      responsibility.  It cannot be said that he misdirected himself or that
      he  acted  unfairly  in  the  assessment  he  made  of  the   relative
      contributions of the various family members.

  20. At the hearing before us, we were told that a decision had  been  made
      in the separate appeal of the claimant's younger brother, Darlit.   At
      a hearing on 19 May 2003, before Mr J M Lewis, adjudicator,  Darlit's
      appeal was allowed.  The hearing was conducted in  the  absence  of  a
      Home Office Presenting Officer.  We have read the determination of the
      adjudicator,  who  concluded  that  the  mother  had  exercised   sole
      responsibility for the upbringing of Darlit since at least  1996.   We
      are not, however, persuaded that the  adjudicator's  determination  in
      Darlit's  appeal,  alters  the  conclusion  we  have  reached  in  the
      claimant's appeal.

Decision:   The claimant's appeal is dismissed.
