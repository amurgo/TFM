Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr R Solomon, Counsel instructed by Jein Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Specialist Appeals Team


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants appeal to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge Bart-Stewart sitting at Taylor  House  on  1
    May  2015)  dismissing  their  appeals  against  the  decision  of  the
    respondent  to  refuse  to  vary  their  leave  to  remain  as  Tier  1
    Entrepreneur Migrants, and against her  concomitant  decision  to  make
    directions for their removal  under  Section  47  of  the  Immigration,
    Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.  The ground  of  appeal  is  that  the
    judge displayed apparent bias in her conduct of  the  proceedings.  The
    First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction, and I  do  not
    consider that the appellants require to be accorded anonymity for these
    proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The appellants are entrepreneurial team members.   Both  of  them  were
    refused under Appendix A (attributes) for the  same  reason.  Mr  Ali's
    application was also refused under Appendix C (maintenance).

 3. In the letter of refusal directed to Mr Ali dated 23 September 2014, it
    was accepted he had provided a Lloyds Bank letter dated 22 July  and  a
    Lloyds Bank statement covering the period 16 June to 5  September  2014
    to demonstrate that he had been in  possession  of  at  least  �945  in
    available funds for a consecutive 90 day period ending no more than  31
    days before the date of the application.  But  the  documents  did  not
    meet the requirements of Appendix C for the  award  of  points  because
    they did not cover the required period.  As his application date was 30
    July 2014, the three month period prior to the date of application  was
    1 May 2014 to 30 July 2014 so he had only provided evidence  for  funds
    for the period 16 June 2014 to 30 July 2014, and no evidence  of  funds
    had been provided for the period 1 May 2014 to 15 June 2014.

 4. Mr Ali failed to score any points under Appendix A (attributes) because
    he had failed to meet the requirements of subparagraph (iv) as  he  had
    not shown that since before 11 July 2014 and up  to  the  date  of  his
    application, he had continuously been working in  an  occupation  which
    appeared on the list of occupations skilled to NQF framework level 4 or
    above, as stated in the  codes  of  practice  at  Appendix  J  and  had
    provided the specified evidence in paragraph 41-SD.

 5. The evidence he had submitted in relation to advertising materials  was
    not acceptable as it did  not  cover  a  continuous  period  commencing
    before 11 July 2014, up to no earlier than three months before the date
    of his application, as required under paragraph 41-SD(e)(iii).   So  he
    had not demonstrated he had met the requirements of  the  Rules  to  be
    awarded points under provision (d) in the  first  row  of  Table  4  of
    Appendix A.

 6. In the refusal letter directed to Mr Javed dated 25 September 2014, the
    respondent gave the same reason  for  not  awarding  him  points  under
    Appendix A (attributes).

 7. In his application form, Mr Ali said he was providing  three  items  of
    advertising material, and the respondent exhibited three separate items
    in section E of the Home Office bundle.

 8. E2 was a printout of an advertisement placed on Gumtree on 9 July  2014
    for  T  &  S  Global  Enterprises  Limited,  the  company   which   the
    entrepreneurial team members had set up.

 9. At E1 were photocopies of two undated documents.  At the  bottom  there
    was a photocopy of Mr Ali's business card for T & S Global  Enterprises
    Limited.  Above this, there was a photocopy of an undated leaflet for T
    & S Global Enterprises Limited promoting the services which Mr Ali  and
    Mr Javed provided.

10. For present purposes, it is convenient to note that the wording on  the
    leaflet is superimposed on a piece of  electronic  equipment.   Between
    the two columns of wording the fine details of the electronic equipment
    are fully visible.  This is just as apparent from  the  photocopies  in
    the respective Home Office bundles as it is from the original which was
    produced at the hearing, and which is retained in my file.

The Hearing before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

11. In advance of the hearing, the appellants' solicitors prepared a bundle
    for each of the appellants containing a short  witness  statement  from
    each of them.  At paragraph 14 of his witness statement, Mr Ali said it
    was unfortunate that the Secretary of State had refused his application
    on the ground that he had failed to provide evidence that he advertised
    before 11 July  2104,  "though  my  brochure  was  printed  before  the
    aforementioned date and clearly states a 20%  discount  until  30  June
    2014".

12. At paragraph 15 he said the Secretary of State had not  given  him  ten
    points for maintenance although he had provided more than 90 days' bank
    statements from a combination of Lloyds Bank and HDL Bank in Pakistan.

13. Mr Javed also asserted in his witness statement that he had provided  a
    brochure which clearly stated a 20% discount until 30 June 2014,  which
    the Secretary of State had failed take into account.

14. As the conduct of the hearing by the judge is said  to  have  displayed
    apparent bias against the appellants it is convenient to  set  out  the
    judge's record of the proceedings which she gives in paragraphs [12] to
    [22] of her subsequent decision:

         "12. The second appellant included a copy bank statement from Habib
             Bank signed and annotated  with  the  date  28-07-14  and  the
             letter from Islamic Bank dated 18.07.14 that states  that  his
             account has  an  available  balance  of  �50,000.   The  first
             appellant's bundle has a photocopy of a  leaflet  with  barely
             legible writing lengthwise in the  middle  that  he  says  was
             before the decision maker.

         13.  Ms [M] sought  to  argue  as  a  preliminary  issue  that  the
             application be remitted to the Secretary of State as not being
             in accordance with the law.  The proposed changes in the rules
             were announced on 10th July 2014 to take effect on  11th  July
             2014.  The Home Office stated that it had not given the  usual
             21 days' notice which she submitted was  procedurally  unfair.
             The respondent should have accepted any  advertising  material
             that  post-dated  11  July  2014  and   exercised   evidential
             flexibility.   As  the  appellant's   case   is   that   their
             advertising material pre dated 11 July 2014 I considered  that
             the issue of procedural unfairness did not arise  and  it  was
             not appropriate to summarily allow the  appeal  and  remit  as
             argued.

         14.  Both appellants gave evidence adopting their respective almost
             identical statements.  The advertisement  that  the  appellant
             submitted to show they had been trading before 11th July  2014
             states it was posted online on 18th  July  2014.   The  second
             appellant gave evidence first.  He confirmed that he had  read
             the rules before completing the application and was  aware  of
             the requirements.  He said the copy leaflet in the bundle says
             '20% discount before 30 June 2014'  which  evidences  it  must
             have been printed before that date.  He had no other  evidence
             of when this leaflet was printed.  In examination he said that
             he had not really looked at the rules before July 2014.

         15.  The first appellant was asked in chief about the copy  leaflet
             in the bundle.  He said the leaflet was produced by a printing
             agency.  The leaflet was with the application, a Gum  tree  on
             line ad and a business card.  He said the bank  statement  was
             also sent to the Home Office.  Asked why he obtained a further
             statement from Lloyds he said that he was thinking that he had
             not submitted his  HBL  (sic)  statement.   Asked  to  clarify
             whether his evidence was he did or  did  not  submit  the  HBL
             statement he said he submitted with the application.

         16.  He was cross examined about his last answer and  said  he  was
             pretty sure he sent it.  He was confused whether he was  going
             the right way.  He said that he is sure  as  it  is  dated  28
             July.  He called his brother who sent it and he  submitted  it
             to the Home Office.  Sometimes he is thinking he did not  send
             it.  He was referred to  the  schedule  of  evidence  that  he
             completed.  He said that 2 leaflets were referred  to  as  one
             document.  He was asked why he sent one with the discount  and
             one without.  He responded that they had 2 leaflets.   He  did
             not have an original of the leaflet showing  the  discount  at
             the hearing and said he would try to find it.  He said that it
             was created in May 2014 by them both.

         17.  I asked when the business began.  He said early April 2014.  I
             asked where the leaflets were printed.  He said in Pakistan as
             it was cheaper.  The one with  the  discount  was  printed  in
             April and the other in May.  His bother sent them  to  him  by
             courier which takes 3 to 4 days.  He said he had  not  thought
             it necessary to bring an original to the hearing.  I asked how
             long the bank statements took to  arrive  as  he  had  said  a
             courier takes 3 to 4 days.  He said that if  urgent  it  is  2
             days.  I noted it was signed on 28 July  and  his  application
             was sent on 30 July.  He said it must have come the next day.

         18.  Re-examined he said that he had shown his solicitor a copy  of
             the leaflet.  He had not shown them the original.   Asked  why
             he ordered 2 leaflets he said when they started  the  business
             they went here and there and tried to get  business  and  then
             decided it was better to put 20% for business.  He  said  that
             he received the HBL statement on 29th July.

         19.  The second appellant was recalled and asked when they  started
             the business and when the leaflets  were  produced.   He  said
             they registered the company on  2  June.   The  leaflets  were
             printed by an agency in Ilford.  Both were printed at the same
             time.  He did not know why the first appellant said they  were
             printed overseas.

         20.  Ms [M] objected to my questions and said  she  would  seek  an
             adjournment.  I pointed out that the evidence  was  introduced
             at the hearing.  Further the copy leaflet in my bundle did not
             show the reference to the discount before  30  June.   It  was
             when the first appellant was cross examined I saw this  having
             exchanged bundles with Ms [M].  It was for the  appellants  to
             make their case that two leaflets  were  before  the  decision
             maker.

         21.  Cross examined the appellant said that maybe 3  leaflets  were
             submitted, one with the discount, one with and a  third  would
             be either.  He said it was to prove they were active.  He said
             the original was net.  It was put to him that the reason there
             is the addition in the middle of the document  because  it  is
             not genuine.  He  denied  this.   He  was  reminded  that  the
             application stated 3 items of marketing.  He said  the  2  ads
             were treated separately and the business card was one.

         22.  Ms [M] went through the number of items  he  claimed  that  he
             submitted  in  examination.   He  said  that  he  counted  the
             leaflets and card as one and an online advert as one and a Gum
             tree ad as the third.  He said the first  appellant  had  been
             responsible for producing the adverts.  They spoke of printing
             the leaflets in Ilford.  He is  not  sure  they  were  printed
             there.  They printed the leaflets with a discount as they were
             trying to get more clients.  A set number  had  the  discount.
             He thinks they started doing work for the business in April."

15. In the section headed Findings and Reasons, the  judge  summarised  the
    issue before her as being whether (a) the bank  statements  from  Habib
    Bank Pakistan and (b) the leaflet referring to a 20% discount operative
    prior to 30 June 2014 had been before the Secretary  of  State  when  a
    case worker made a decision on the respective applications.  The  judge
    found that the appellants had not proved their  case  for  the  reasons
    which she gave in paragraphs [25] to [28], which I set out below:

         "25. Copies of the completed application forms are at Appendix A of
             the respondent's bundles.  At page 56 each have listed 2  bank
             statements and 3 marketing + leaflet.  Both  concede  in  oral
             evidence that the evidence of  marketing  included  an  online
             internet search result on Gumtree dated 19/07/2014  marked  as
             'posted yesterday'.   The  leaflet  in  the  first  appellants
             bundle is undated and without reference to a  discount  and  a
             business card.  The second appellant included an online advert
             on 'FRIDAY-AD' also marked posted  yesterday  and  printed  on
             19/07/2014.

         26.  The issue was whether the Habib Bank statement and the leaflet
             showing the discount were new evidence.  The evidence  of  the
             appellant in respect  of  the  leaflet  was  inconsistent  and
             contradictory, compounded by the  inconsistent  oral  evidence
             regarding  when  they  commenced  the  business.   The   first
             appellant claimed the leaflets were printed in  Pakistan  then
             sent to him by courier on 2 separate  occasions.   The  second
             appellant said they were printed in Ilford.  Even  if  it  was
             the responsibility of  the  first  appellant  and  giving  the
             benefit of the doubt he might not be sure,  his  evidence  was
             they were printed at the same time.  He said nothing  about  2
             different batches being printed and couriered  to  them.   The
             likelihood of that occurring I find lacks plausibility  and  I
             do not accept that the leaflet reflecting the discount was  at
             any time before the decision maker.

         27.  I also do not accept the evidence of the first appellant  with
             regard to the HBL statements.  The application form refers  to
             2 bank statements.  There was the letter  from  HBL  regarding
             the �50,000 capital and a letter  and  statement  from  Lloyds
             Bank.  He could not give a clear answer to the question why he
             submitted the Lloyds  statement  if  he  had  the  Habib  Bank
             statement that showed the required funds.  When  referring  to
             the leaflets he had said that a courier  takes  3  to  4  days
             however when I pointed out to him that the bank statement  was
             certified 2 days before submission he claimed that it  arrived
             in the UK the next day.

         28.  I have regard to the principles established in  Tanveer  Ahmed
             [2002] UKIAT 00439 'It is for an individual [claimant] to show
             that a document on which he seeks to rely can  be  relied  on.
             The decision maker should consider whether a document  is  one
             on which reliance should properly be placed after  looking  at
             all the evidence in the round.  Only very rarely will there be
             the need to make an allegation of forgery, or evidence  strong
             enough to support it.   The  allegation  should  not  be  made
             without such evidence.  Failure to establish the allegation on
             the balance of probabilities to the higher civil standard does
             not show that a document  is  reliable.   The  decision  maker
             still needs to apply principles 1 and 2'.   Neither  appellant
             produced the original of the leaflet nor other contemporaneous
             material such as invoices that might evidence that the leaflet
             showing a discount to 30th  June  was  produced  at  the  time
             stated and so available to be submitted with the  application.
             I find it was not."

The Application for Permission to Appeal

16. Ms M settled the application for permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal.  Ground 1 was the judge had breached  fundamental  principles
    of natural justice and procedural fairness by descending into the arena
    of  cross-examination.   In  doing  so,  a  reasonable  observer  would
    perceive potential for bias.

17. Mr Ali had given evidence first, and the judge had not  asked  him  any
    questions.  Mr Javed had then given evidence,  and  during  his  cross-
    examination the judge said abruptly: "Stop  muttering.   I  don't  know
    what you're saying, you're just muttering."

18. The judge then questioned Mr Javed after cross-examination about issues
    which had not been raised at all  by  the  Presenting  Officer,  namely
    about the genuineness of the advertising leaflet with a 20% discount on
    it.  The judge did not acknowledge at paragraph 17 of her decision that
    she had put a question to Mr Javed to the effect that  the  advertising
    leaflet was not genuine.  The judge then said she wanted to  recall  Mr
    Ali, and she proceeded to question him before any  questions  had  been
    put to him by either Counsel or  the  Presenting  Officer.   The  judge
    failed to acknowledge at paragraph 19 of her decision that it  was  she
    who recalled Mr Ali.

19. Counsel for the appellants objected that the judge had  descended  into
    the arena of cross-examination, and that  she  wanted  an  adjournment.
    The objection was acknowledged at paragraph 20 of the judge's decision,
    but the judge did not state the reasons for Counsel's objection nor did
    she acknowledge that she had put matters to Mr Ali.   After  the  judge
    had stopped questioning Mr Ali, the Presenting Officer put  to  Mr  Ali
    that the leaflet was not genuine.

20. The impression thus  given  to  a  reasonable  observer  was  that  the
    appellants did not have a fair hearing.  It  was  immaterial  what  the
    outcome may or may not have been as the  judge  wrongly  cross-examined
    the appellants.

21. It was submitted by Counsel to the judge in closing submissions that as
    the appellants had produced their own advertising leaflets, they  could
    not be forgeries.  The judge had irrationally decided that  a  document
    produced by the appellants was a forgery and on the basis of that  line
    of thinking and prejudging the case she had procedurally  taken  unfair
    steps to cross-examine them.  Accordingly she had already made  up  her
    mind without hearing all the evidence first.

22. Ground 2 was the judge had misdirected  herself  by  not  allowing  the
    appeal  on  the  ground  that  the  decision  of  the  respondent   was
    procedurally unfair and not in accordance with the law.   Following  on
    from ground 1, as the judge had already made up her mind at the hearing
    to dismiss the appeal on the basis that the  appellants'  own  document
    was allegedly a forgery, this  may  have  affected  her  assessment  of
    whether the respondent's decision was unfair.

The Grant of Permission to Appeal

23. On 26 July 2015 First-tier Tribunal Judge McDade granted permission  to
    appeal for the following reasons:

         "The grounds of application for permission to  appeal  assert  that
         the judge descended into the arena by asking  questions  that  were
         effectively questions of  cross-examination  and  then  recalled  a
         witness of whom the judge had not asked any  questions  during  the
         witness' first presentation but then  proceeded  to  question  that
         witness before giving either of the advocates an opportunity to ask
         any questions of their own.  It is asserted that the way  in  which
         all of this was conducted was not recorded in the judge's decision.
          If the grounds of application are accurate (and any  notes  taking
         at the  hearing  by  the  advocates  should  subsequently  be  made
         available to the error of law hearing) there is an  arguable  error
         of law."

The Rule 24 Response

24. On 11 August 2015 John Parkinson of the Specialist Appeals Team settled
    the Rule 24 response on behalf of the Secretary of State  opposing  the
    appeal.  In summary, he submitted that  the  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal had directed herself appropriately.  He continued:

         "3.   The  respondent  has  consulted  the  hearing  note  of   the
             Presenting Officer which confirms that  a  limited  number  of
             questions were asked by the judge.  The note also contains the
             telling comment that:

                  "The representative applied for an  adjournment  to  which
                  the IJ refused.  However the IJ did not  ask  any  further
                  questions.  I then asked to re-examine on the basis of the
                  IJ's questions to the first  Appellant.   The  IJ  allowed
                  questions to be put to the Appellant that had arisen  from
                  her own.

                  I put further questions to the first  Appellant  regarding
             the leaflet.

                  It was obvious the representative wanted  to  adjourn  the
                  appeal as it  was  becoming  clear  that  the  Appellants'
                  business was not genuine."

         4.   It was open to the judge to seek to clarify matters that arose
             from the evidence of the  appellant  and  when  this  evidence
             provided further  uncertainties  in  the  appellants'  claimed
             business to seek to clarify the evidence with reference to the
             first appellant's previous evidence.

         5.   In doing so the judge extended the opportunity to the  parties
             to deal with  matters  arising  from  the  second  appellant's
             evidence.  Such an approach  would  appear  to  be  reasonable
             under the circumstances.  It would have been  arguably  unfair
             for the judge to have taken points against the  appellants  if
             they were not given the opportunity of addressing them at  the
             hearing."

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

25. At the hearing to determine whether an error of law was made  out,  the
    Mr Solomon drew my attention to a witness statement from  Counsel,  who
    asked not to be named in my decision, stating that what she had said in
    the grounds of appeal was true to the best of her knowledge and belief.
     She exhibited as an annexure to her witness statement a  copy  of  the
    notes which she had endorsed on her brief as to what  had  happened  at
    the hearing, and I noted that  her  grounds  of  appeal  reflected  the
    contents of these notes.

26. Mr Tufan produced the Presenting Officer's note of the hearing dated 11
    May 2015, from which Mr Parkinson had quoted in his Rule  24  response.
    The Presenting Officer's account was broadly in line with that given by
    Counsel, except that  she  did  not  report  the  judge  as  displaying
    hostility to either witness, and she did not characterise  the  judge's
    questioning as being akin to cross-examination.

27. Mr Solomon invited me to focus on what was common  ground  between  the
    Presenting Officer and Counsel. He submitted  that  on  the  undisputed
    facts the judge had wrongly descended  into  the  arena,  and  she  had
    sought to develop a different case from that  being  presented  by  the
    Presenting Officer and/or to pursue her own theory  of  the  case.   He
    drew my attention to various passages in K v Secretary of State for the
    Home Department  (C�te  d'Ivoire)  [2004]  UKIAT  00621  in  which  the
    Tribunal gave extensive consideration to an observation in the  earlier
    case of Oyono [2002] UKAIT 2034 that an Adjudicator's role was that  of
    silent listening, and that an Adjudicator  who  intervenes  during  the
    course of evidence is running the risk that  he  will  be  seen  to  be
    taking the side of one party or the other.

28. Mr Solomon also drew my attention to Alubankudi  (appearance  of  bias)
    [2015] UKUT 542 (IAC) which confirmed that the test to be  applied  was
    whether the fair-minded observer, having considered  the  facts,  would
    conclude there was a real possibility that the Tribunal was biased.  To
    this end, the court must first ascertain all  the  circumstances  which
    would have a bearing on the suggestion that the judge was biased and it
    must then ask whether those  circumstances  would  lead  a  fair-minded
    informed observer to conclude that there was a  real  possibility  that
    the judge was biased.

29. The President observed at paragraph [8]  that  the  authorities  placed
    emphasis on the requirement that the hypothetical  reasonable  observer
    is duly informed.  This connotes that the observer is in possession  of
    all material facts.

30. In that case, the complaint of apparent bias was  based  on  a  comment
    which the judge had made in his determination, not on  his  conduct  of
    the hearing.  In so far as it is material, the President regarded it as
    significant that there was no challenge to any of the judge's  findings
    - on the basis of irrationality or the disregard of  material  evidence
    or the intrusion of immaterial factors:

         "We observe that the presence of any of  these  vitiating  elements
         could, in principle, lend sustenance to the  appellant's  complaint
         of apparent bias.  However, none is evident."

31. On behalf of the Secretary of State, Mr Tufan took  the  same  line  as
    that taken by his colleague in the Rule 24 response.  The  judge  would
    have been open to criticism is she  had  not  given  the  witnesses  an
    opportunity to deal with the concerns which she had about  the  genesis
    of the "discount" leaflet.

32. In reply, Mr Solomon said the judge was probably not biased, but by her
    conduct at the hearing she gave the appearance of bias.

Discussion

33. The leading case on apparent bias  is  Locabail  (UK)  Ltd  v  Bayfield
    Properties Ltd & Another [1999] EWCA Civ 3004.  At paragraph  [21]  the
    court cited with  approval  the  following  observations  made  by  the
    Constitutional Court of South Africa:

         "It follows from the foregoing that the correct  approach  to  this
         application for the recusal of members of this court  is  objective
         and the onus of establishing it  rests  upon  the  applicant.   The
         question is whether a reasonable,  objective  and  informed  person
         would on the correct facts reasonably apprehend that the judge  has
         not or will not bring an impartial mind to bear on the adjudication
         of the case, that is a mind open to persuasion by the evidence  and
         submissions of Counsel (my emphasis).  The  reasonableness  of  the
         apprehension must be assessed in the light of the  oath  of  office
         taken by the judges to administer justice without fear  or  favour;
         and their ability to  carry  out  that  oath  by  reason  of  their
         training and experience.  It must be assumed that they can disabuse
         their minds of any irrelevant personal beliefs or  predispositions.
         They must take into account the fact they have a duty to sit in any
         case in which they are not obliged to recuse  themselves.   At  the
         same time, it must never be forgotten that an  impartial  judge  is
         the fundamental prerequisite  for  a  fair  trial  and  a  judicial
         officer should not hesitate to recuse herself or himself  if  there
         are reasonable grounds on the part of a litigant  for  apprehending
         that the judicial officer, for whatever reasons, was  not  or  will
         not be impartial."

34.  The  observations  of  the  South  African  Constitutional  Court  are
    condensed in the test for apparent bias subsequently formulated by  the
    House of Lords in Porter v Magill [2002] 2 AC 357 as follows:

         "Whether the fair minded and informed observer,  having  considered
         the facts, would conclude that there was a  real  possibility  that
         the judge was biased."

35. It is common ground that the first judicial intervention in the  taking
    of evidence was after  the  second  witness  had  been  cross-examined.
    According to the judge's detailed manuscript notes and  the  Presenting
    Officer's file note, Mr Javed gave evidence  first,  and  Mr  Ali  gave
    evidence second.  Ms M agrees that the second appellant  gave  evidence
    first, but she treats Mr Ali as the second  appellant.  Ms  M  has  not
    provided her notes of the evidence, but only her notes on the brief  in
    which she singles out the interventions of the judge  that  caused  her
    concern. The judge is right, and Ms M is wrong, on  the  order  of  the
    witnesses as the second witness (Mr Ali) was questioned about  his  HBL
    statement: see paragraph [15] of the decision.

36. The judge explains what triggered her first intervention  at  paragraph
    [20] of her decision.  It was when the  first  appellant  Mr  Ali  (the
    second witness) was cross-examined that she saw a copy leaflet  showing
    a reference to the discount  before  30  June.   She  saw  this  having
    exchanged  bundles  with  Counsel.   Clearly  Counsel  had  a   clearer
    photocopy than was hitherto in the possession of the  judge,  and  this
    reflects Mr Solomon's understanding of the position.

37. Mr Solomon provided me with the superior copy of the discount  leaflet,
    and it is very striking.  The poor photocopy version  is  described  by
    the judge at paragraph [12].  As she  says,  there  is  barely  legible
    writing lengthwise in the middle.  The photocopying  is  so  poor  that
    nothing can be inferred  or  deduced  as  to  whether  the  writing  is
    integral to the leaflet, or has been added.  In contrast, the  superior
    copy of the discount leaflet clearly presents as an altered version  of
    the undated leaflet.  This is because the electronic equipment  clearly
    shown in the undated leaflet also shows up in a  haphazard  and  untidy
    way underneath the jagged and unevenly edged  banner  which  runs  down
    between the two columns of words.  The discount message appears on  the
    banner.  But as the banner  is  not  completely  opaque,  bits  of  the
    electronic equipment show through the banner, and thus make  the  first
    part of the message difficult to decipher.  In short, it  looks  as  if
    the discount leaflet has been created by  adding  the  banner  and  the
    accompanying discount message to an original undated leaflet - and  not
    by reprinting the leaflet so as to make  the  banner  and  accompanying
    discount message appear integral to the overall design.

38. It was thus not irrational for the judge to  ask  Mr  Ali  whether  the
    document had been altered.  On the  contrary,  having  been  confronted
    with this important piece of evidence which was crucial  to  the  issue
    which she had  to  decide,  fairness  demanded  that  she  should  seek
    clarification from Mr Ali as to the genesis of the discount leaflet.

39. The judge was not thereby developing her own theory of  the  case.  The
    judge did not put to Mr Ali that he had altered the document  in  order
    to mislead. She posed a neutral question, the answer to which might  or
    might not have assisted  the  respondent.   The  question  whether  the
    leaflet had been altered,  and  the  surrounding  questions  about  the
    genesis of the two leaflets (the undated  one  and  the  one  with  the
    discount message) were all relevant to  the  issue  which  was  already
    before the judge, which was whether the appellants had  discharged  the
    burden of proving that they had provided an original  of  the  discount
    leaflet with their respective applications. For they could only succeed
    in their appeals if they could prove that the discount leaflet had been
    provided with their  respective  applications,  as  only  the  discount
    leaflet had a relevant date on it.

40. No objection is taken to the judge's surrounding questions, the answers
    to which are recorded in paragraph [17] of the judge's  decision.   The
    objection to the judge's first intervention is solely  to  one  of  her
    questions about the genesis of the discount leaflet, which was that the
    (superior) photocopy of the  leaflet  made  it  look  like  an  altered
    document rather than a printed document, to which Mr Ali  said  no,  it
    was a printed document. It is not suggested that  the  judge  expressed
    incredulity at this answer.

41. Mr Solomon submitted that since Ms Laverack,  the  Presenting  Officer,
    had not raised the issue in cross-examination of  either  witness,  the
    judge ought not to have raised it by way of purported clarification.

42. On the available evidence  Ms  Laverack  did  not  have  sight  of  the
    superior copy at the time when she first cross-examined Mr Javed and Mr
    Ali.  So the fair-minded observer would not treat her failure to  raise
    the point initially in cross-examination as a concession  by  her  that
    the discount leaflet had not been altered or that it did not look  like
    it had been altered.  In any event, the judge was  not  constrained  by
    the scope of Ms Laverack's initial  cross-examination  from  raising  a
    matter that was of concern to her as the trier of fact.

43. The second judicial intervention,  and  the  one  which  triggered  the
    application for an adjournment, was the judge's recalling of  Mr  Javed
    in order to put similar questions to him which she had put to  Mr  Ali.
    However, it is not alleged  that  the  judge  asked  Mr  Javed  if  the
    discount leaflet had been altered.  The nature of the questions  asked,
    and the answers which were elicited, are set out in paragraph  [19]  of
    the judge's decision, and it is not suggested in the grounds of  appeal
    that paragraph [19] is inaccurate.

44. Counsel's recollection that at one point the judge put to  Mr  Javed  a
    suggestion that had been made by Mr Ali (the judge was not  putting  to
    the witness her own suggestion, as Ms M arguably implies) accords  with
    the final sentence of paragraph [19] of the decision, where  the  judge
    records Mr Javed as saying he did not know why the first appellant  (Mr
    Ali) said that the leaflets were printed overseas.  Mr Javed could only
    have given this answer if it was "put" to him by the  judge  that  this
    was the evidence of  his  entrepreneurial  team  member.   This  was  a
    legitimate question from the judge. It was permissible  (see  K  below)
    for the judge to put the apparent discrepancy to Mr Javed. It  gave  Mr
    Javed the opportunity to clarify  his  own  evidence  about  where  the
    leaflets had been printed.  He  might  have  been  able  to  give  some
    clarification which dissolved the apparent discrepancy between him  and
    his entrepreneurial team member on this issue  (such  as  the  leaflets
    being printed overseas on a subcontract from the agency in Ilford).

45. Taken as a whole, I do not consider that the judge's questioning of  Mr
    Ali,  followed  by  her  recall  and  questioning  of  Mr  Javed,   was
    procedurally irregular or such as to create the reasonable apprehension
    that the judge  did  not  bring  an  impartial  mind  to  bear  on  the
    adjudication of the case, that is a mind  open  to  persuasion  by  the
    evidence and submissions of Counsel. I am reinforced in this finding by
    the  observations  of  the  Presidential  panel  in  K  which  I   have
    highlighted below.

46. K was decided by a panel chaired by the then President of the Tribunal,
    Ouseley  J.   Of  particular  pertinence  to  this   appeal   are   the
    observations of the panel at paragraphs [42] to [44], [47] and [54]  to
    [55].  The panel held that there was a danger that the comments  relied
    on in Oyono have been misunderstood.  Even where the parties  are  both
    represented, it is still  relevant  for  questions  to  be  put  by  an
    Adjudicator to a witness  if  they  raise  matters  which  trouble  the
    Adjudicator even if they have not been raised  or  dealt  with  by  the
    opposing advocate.   This  is  especially  so  if  the  Adjudicator  is
    concerned by the point  and  it  is  something  which  may  affect  the
    decision or indeed should affect the decision, but cannot fairly do  so
    without the relevant witness being given the opportunity to  deal  with
    it.

47. If there are inconsistencies between documents  and  oral  evidence  or
    between answers which had been given already, it is nearly always  best
    to wait until after cross-examination and re-examination  to  see  what
    matters are put. (Judge  Bart-Stewart  complied  with  this  guidance).
    However, it is wholly legitimate for the Adjudicator ask his or her own
    questions on issues of inconsistency,  points  raised  in  the  refusal
    letter or matters which trouble the Adjudicator whether or not they are
    raised by the other party.  What is important, however, in relation  to
    those matters is an Adjudicator should not  develop  a  different  case
    from that being presented by the other party or pursue his or  her  own
    theory of the case.  The manner in which any intervention is undertaken
    is also important.  It should not be done in any hostile manner or in a
    manner which suggests that the Adjudicator's mind  has  been  made  up.
    Questions should not be leading questions or  ones  which  conceal  the
    purpose for which they are asked, but instead should be direct and open-
    ended questions.  It is perfectly proper for the  Adjudicator  to  ask,
    after questions have been put in cross-examination  and  re-examination
    had taken place, why a witness has  said  X  when  earlier  or  another
    witness has said Y, or how document X can be reconciled  with  document
    or oral evidence Y.  An Adjudicator is entitled to follow  the  logical
    train of answers to see how they fit with the case if that is  regarded
    as potentially significant for an  issue  in  the  case.   It  is  also
    important however that an Adjudicator should keep a sense of proportion
    about the  questions  which  he  or  she  asks.   It  is  not  for  the
    Adjudicator to take over conduct of the case either by  the  number  of
    questions asked or the development of his or  her  own  theories.   The
    interventions may or may not assist one or other party.  They  are  not
    unfair merely because one or other party  may  derive  assistance  from
    them.

48. On the particular facts of the case before them, the panel commented at
    paragraph [47] there had been no suggestion of anything in the tone  of
    the Adjudicator's questions which indicated hostility or  a  mind  made
    up.  If the questions were of assistance to one  side  rather  than  to
    another, that reflected the weakness of the case and could  not  impose
    an obligation on the Adjudicator not to ask the questions.   They  were
    not overlong in number or disproportionate to the issues; and they  did
    not involve the Adjudicator going off on some misguided frolic  of  her
    own.

49. At paragraph [54]  the  panel  recognised  that  where  allegations  of
    unfairness are made, they had to be looked at as a whole and one cannot
    exclude from one's consideration of them the sort of  incidents  which,
    minor in themselves, may indicate that there was hostility  towards  an
    advocate or to a party which precluded a fair hearing being or  seeming
    to be fair.  In the particular case before them, the panel  found  that
    it was possible there  was  some  irritation  between  the  appellant's
    advocate and the Adjudicator at an early stage.  They did not  consider
    that a fair-minded observer, in  possession  of  all  the  information,
    would have concluded that there was a real risk  that  the  Adjudicator
    was biased.

         "It is important that a  fair-minded  observer  would  be  able  to
         distinguish between an Adjudicator firmly  in  control  of  a  case
         behaving fairly and properly in order to  ascertain  how  the  case
         related to the available evidence and somebody who  was  indicating
         hostility towards a party or predetermination  through  the  timing
         and manner  of  intervention.   Regrettable  occasional  irritation
         between judge and advocate does not suffice for a case of  apparent
         bias."

50. Counsel's recollection that  Judge  Bart-Stewart  expressed  irritation
    towards one of the witnesses when he was giving  evidence  (complaining
    that he was muttering) does not in my judgment suffice for  a  case  of
    apparent bias.

51. Accordingly, I find that the main ground of appeal  is  not  made  out.
    Insofar as it is material, I observe that the judge did  not  make  any
    interventions on the separate issue of Mr  Ali's  compliance  with  the
    requirements of Appendix C (maintenance) so there was never  any  basis
    for arguing that her decision on this discrete  issue  was  tainted  by
    apparent bias.

52. There is also no merit in ground  2.   The  judge  addressed  Counsel's
    argument that the decision appealed against was procedurally unfair  as
    a preliminary issue before she had begun to hear any evidence from  the
    witnesses.   Thus  there  was  never  an  evidential  basis   for   the
    proposition that her decision on the preliminary issue was  tainted  by
    bias - because she had (allegedly) already made up her mind to  dismiss
    the appeal on the  ground  that  the  discount  leaflet  was  a  forged
    document.

53. The judge has given adequate reasons for dismissing the case  that  the
    decision appealed against was procedurally unfair, and no error of  law
    is made out.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not contain an  error  of  law,
