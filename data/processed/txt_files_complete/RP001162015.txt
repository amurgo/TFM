Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr D Sellwood, Counsel instructed by Wilson LLP
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr L Tarlow, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
                            DECISION AND REASONS

Pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
we make an order prohibiting the disclosure or  publication  of  any  matter
likely to lead members of the public to identify the  appellant.  Breach  of
this order can be punished as a  contempt  of  court.  We  make  this  order
because this is a protection  case  and  there  is  an  inherent  risk  that
publicity could create a risk for the appellant in the event of  his  return
and also because his personal vulnerability could  attract  people  of  ill-
will in the United Kingdom.

This is an appeal against a decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  dismissing
the appellant's appeal against  the  decision  of  the  Secretary  of  State
refusing him leave to remain  on  human  rights  grounds  and  refusing  him
international protection.  The appellant is subject to a deportation order.

The appeal turns on the tension between  the  public  interest  in  removing
foreign criminals and the particular difficulties that this appellant  would
face in the event of his return to Somaliland on account of his poor  health
and personal limitations.

By way of introduction we paraphrase the opening paragraphs in  the  grounds
for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.

This shows that the  appellant  was  born  in  about  1984  (there  is  some
inconsistency  on  the   evidence)   and   he   has   significant   learning
difficulties.  His IQ has been assessed at 55.

Additionally the appellant has a history of epileptic  seizures  and  during
one such seizure, in September 2013,  he  fell  and  sustained  moderate  to
severe traumatic brain injury.  He suffers from anxiety and  depression  and
alcohol dependency and requires help to carry out daily tasks.

His family are in the United Kingdom lawfully except for one brother who  is
believed to be in Ethiopia.  The appellant fled Somalia with his  family  in
about 1991 going first to Ethiopia and then entering the United  Kingdom  in
1993.  The appellant was recognised as a refugee and given leave  to  remain
indefinitely on 13 June 1994. It follows that, at the time of writing he  is
about 34 years old and has lived in the  United  Kingdom  for  the  last  25
years since he was aged 9 years od

However his behaviour has been unacceptable.  He has been  convicted  on  32
different occasions for a total of 69 offences. At the Crown  Court  sitting
at Harrow on 18 March 2007 he was sentenced to two years'  imprisonment  for
attempted robbery and three years' imprisonment for breach  of  a  community
order, the sentences to be served consecutively. It  was  those  convictions
that led to the decision to deport him, and a deportation order was  signed,
on 15 April 2010. Save for any extension by reason of an appeal,  any  leave
he had to be in the United Kingdom  came  to  an  end  when  the  order  was
signed.

As we explain below, he has been in trouble since then.

He  appealed  against  that  decision  and   the   appeal   was   dismissed.
Nevertheless, however strong the public interest in removal may  have  been,
the appellant was not removed.

He then made further submissions in 2012, 2014 and most recently 6  November
2015.  On 25 November 2015 the respondent refused to revoke the  deportation
order but accepted that the further submissions did amount to a fresh  claim
and that led to the instant appeal.  It  was  heard  and  dismissed  by  the
First-tier Tribunal on 16 October 2017.

The concluding paragraph of the  First-tier  Tribunal's  decision  sets  out
well the judge's findings and concerns. The judge said:

  "It is a tragic case.  The conclusion may be  considered  harsh,  however
  the UK is not responsible for his medical  condition  and  very  powerful
  weight is to be  given  to  the  public  interest  in  deporting  foreign
  criminals.  The long line of cases since D v UK confirmed that 'Article 3
  does not place an obligation on the Contracting State to  alleviate  such
  disparities through the provision of free and unlimited healthcare to all
  aliens without a right to stay within  its  jurisdiction'.   His  removal
  will not lead to an early death.  There  are  aspects  of  his  lifestyle
  under his control to mitigate some of the consequences of  his  condition
  with available medical support.  His parents are hesitant about  extended
  family in Somalia or Somaliland.  I am satisfied support can be available
  there.  I find that there would not be a violation of Article  3  of  the
  ECHR were the appellant to be deported and there  would  not  be  a  very
  significant integration into Somaliland  whereby  the  deportation  order
  should be revoked."

At the start of the hearing before us Mr Tarlow made clear that it  was  the
Secretary of State's intention to return the appellant  to  Somaliland.   We
are grateful for this unequivocal indication.  It narrows the issues  before
us.

We now look with more care at the reasons of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for
dismissing the appeal.

It is quite clear that the First-tier Tribunal appreciated that  the  public
interest lies in the appellant being deported. Without labouring the  point,
we appreciate it too. The appellant  is  a  "foreign  criminal"  within  the
meaning of the phrase in part 5 of the Act. He  is  subject  to  "automatic"
deportation  because  he  has  been  sentenced  to  at  least   12   months'
imprisonment  (but  not  "at  least  4  years"  because  consecutive   terms
exceeding 4 years in aggregated do not count  (section  117D(4)b)).  He  has
also been found to be a "persistent offender".  Additionally the  First-tier
Tribunal heard and accepted evidence  from  a  police  officer  involved  in
Operation Nexus that the appellant was "identified as a  high  harm  foreign
offender under their criteria".

The First-tier Tribunal Judge had regard  to  part  5  of  the  Nationality,
Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and the  substantially  similar  immigration
rules.

The judge decided that paragraph 399 of HC 396 did  not  apply  because  the
appellant does not have a partner or dependent  child.   For  precisely  the
same reasons Exception 2 at Section 117C(5) of the 2002 Act does not  assist
this appellant.  The judge  decided  that  paragraph  399A  does  not  apply
because the appellant was not "socially and  culturally  integrated  in  the
UK".  This is the same wording as paragraph  117C(4)(b)  of  the  2002  Act.
When the appellant last appeared  before  the  Crown  Court  the  sentencing
judge commented that he had led a "totally useless and  pointless  life"  in
the United Kingdom.  That might not be thought kind  but  was  made  in  the
light of the evidence of persistent criminal behaviour, some of it  serious,
and apparent inability to respond to penalties that tried to help him.

The first-tier tribunal judge clearly did not accept that the appellant  was
"socially and culturally integrated into the UK." Although  there  was  some
skimpy evidence that the appellant had started voluntary  work  he  remained
unemployable and alcohol dependant. There is  no  fault  in  the  First-tier
Tribunal's finding that the appellant was not "integrated".

It follows therefore that the judge was  given  clear  reasons  for  finding
that the appellant could not satisfy the requirements of Section 117C in  an
Article 8 balancing exercise.

It was still open to the judge to allow the  appeal  on  article  8  grounds
because  there  were  compelling  compassionate   circumstances   or   "very
compelling circumstances over and above" Exceptions 1 and 2.

The judge did ask herself if there "would be very significant  obstacles  to
[the appellant's] integration into the country into which he would  have  to
go.  This is slightly surprising because the  "very  significant  obstacles"
test is set out in Exception 1 under the Section 117C  and  under  paragraph
399 which the judge found did not apply.  Nevertheless the test is a  useful
if imperfect tool in considering the article 8  balancing  exercise  because
it focusses attention on how the appellant could cope in the  event  of  his
return.

The appellant relied on both article 8 and article 3.

With this in mind the judge was looking for evidence of the  effect  of  the
appellant's ill-health.

Although the judge, appropriately, took the relevant parts of  the  decision
of the Tribunal in 2010 as her starting point  she  also  noted  that  since
then the appellant's circumstances have changed. As well  as  continuing  to
drink and break the law the appellant suffered a traumatic brain  injury  in
September 2013. In simple, non-technical  language,  this  made  his  health
significantly worse.

The appellant has been in trouble since his appeal against  deportation  was
dismissed in 2010, most  recently  in  2015  but  the  judge  did  not  give
details. She did accept "Operation Nexus" evidence that  the  appellant  had
been bailed to attend the police station  in  December  2016  but  that,  in
isolation, cannot take matter very far.

According to the First-tier Tribunal, the officer:

  "wished to impress on the court police concerns about the  appellant  and
  his offending.  She is concerned he will continue to reoffend  and  place
  members of the public at risk."

Whilst the First-tier Tribunal was plainly entitled to give weight  to  that
evidence without being in any way disrespectful to the  police  officer  her
evidence was wholly unremarkable.  Whatever the reasons for the  appellant's
offending may be it cannot be doubted that the appellant's long  history  of
offending supplemented by his failure to address  his  alcoholism  makes  it
inherently likely that he will be in further trouble.  The appellant's  case
is not put on the basis that he is not a risk to the  public  but  that  his
personal circumstances  make  him  so  vulnerable  that  he  should  not  be
removed.

The judge noted that the appellant is epileptic and suffers  from  "frequent
seizures". She noted too that he sustained a brain injury in 2013,  that  he
has memory problems and, that he "relies on a carer."

His epilepsy is  not  well  controlled.  He  is  a  "frequent  attender"  at
accident and emergency departments of  hospitals  and  his  general  medical
practitioner thought it would "helpful"  if  he  was  supervised  by  family
members.

The judge considered medical evidence from Prof David Sharpe and  Dr  Steven
White who are Consultant Neurologists in the National Health  Service,  from
Dr Tony Goldstone, a clinical scientist and consultant  Endocrinologist  and
Dr Frank Arnold a specialist in  wound  healing.  Dr  Arnold  had  contacted
"Lookahead", a charity that provided the appellant with social support.

The Judge also saw records  from  MNA  Care  Services  confirming  that  the
appellant  "receives  assistance  with  bath/shower  and  personal  care   4
mornings a week". This case began in June  2017  and  that  his  mother  and
sisters support him with "shopping and meal preparation".

This included evidence that Professor Sharpe would be "very worried" if  the
appellant were not able to get  access  to  skilled  medical  support.   The
appellant has "severe epilepsy" and  in  the  event  of  the  appellant  not
getting proper control, something he found difficult in the  United  Kingdom
where medical supplies are readily  available,  he  would  "be  at  a  great
medical risk".

Difficulties associated with epilepsy were explained in more  detail.  There
is no need to repeat them here. They are embarrassing for the appellant  and
anyone else present.

The medical practitioners could not  envisage  a  point  when  the  claimant
could do without medical support.  There were concerns about  a  sustainable
supply of medication in the event of return.

The judge clearly found that drugs are available but not  reliably  and  not
necessarily the ones that clinicians in the United  Kingdom  would  want  to
prescribe.

The Judge noted evidence that the appellant  presently  receives  assistance
with bathing and showering in his personal care four mornings a week.   This
is supplemented by support from his family.

She noted evidence that the appellant's  capacity  for  self-care  is  "very
limited".  It is of particular concern that it is unsafe for him to bath  or
shower unless he loses consciousness and hurt himself.   This  is  not  just
theoretical.  It is a problem that has presented in the past.

We find the judge's summary of the evidence of the  appellant's  care  needs
at paragraph 60 to be very significant. The judge said:

  "His capacity for self-care is very limited. He  can  dress  himself  but
  cannot cook or shop for himself. It is  unsafe  [for]  him  to  bathe  or
  shower unattended because he has lost consciousness while  attempting  to
  do so in the past. This is a known result with uncontrolled epilepsy  and
  is a recognised cause of death in that condition. For this reason  social
  services have provided a carer to help the appellant.  A  member  of  his
  family usually accompanies him when he goes out lest for example he has a
  fit in front of a moving vehicle. He has been assessed as unfit for  paid
  work and is in receipt of Disability Living Allowance.  The  Lookahead  a
  key worker has  said  that  in  an  effort  to  address  the  appellant's
  neurobehavioral problems and social dislocation he has been  referred  to
  and sought help from them with a view to obtaining a Personal Independent
  Payment and using this to support him in engaging  in  voluntary  service
  within the limits of his abilities."

The judge then noted  in  considerable  detail  the  evidence  of  Dr  Craig
McNulty an  independent  clinical  psychologist.   It  is  Dr  McNulty  that
assessed the appellant's overall IQ at 55 subject  to  the  rider  that  his
verbal comprehension is rather better than might  be  expected  for  someone
with that score.  Dr McNulty finds that people such as  the  appellant  were
easily exploited and tended to  be  socially  na�ve  and  had  poor  problem
solving skills.

At around paragraph 75 of her Decision and  Reasons  the  Judge  looked  for
things that had  changed  since  the  appellant's  previous  appeal  against
deportation had been dismissed. She noted that the appellant claims to  have
given up using illicit drugs but  still  consumes  alcohol  to  satisfy  his
addiction. Dr McNulty  thought  that  the  appellant  would  revert  to  his
previous bad behaviour if the threat of deportation was removed.

The  judge  was  unimpressed  with  evidence  that  the   appellant   risked
imprisonment  or  being  ostracised  if  he  continued  to  drink   alcohol,
reasoning that even though he is an alcoholic, he could choose not to  drink
and was not entitled to protection against the consequences of  choosing  to
drink.

The judge was satisfied that some drugs  are  available  in  Somaliland  for
people suffering from epilepsy and some treatment is available for  mentally
ill people.

At paragraph 89 of her  decision  the  judge  accepted  that  the  appellant
"currently lives with his family and  appears  to  have  some  support"  the
family could not keep him out of trouble and he was able to get about.

At paragraph 90 she said  that  the  appellant  remained  a  danger  to  the
public, adding that there "was no real progress from his time in  prison  on
release he continued to offend". She said that it "is not the  role  of  the
UK to protect him from his own self damaging behaviour".

She found that the apparent improvement in  the  appellant's  behaviour  was
the "inhibiting factor" of deportation.

The judge found that medications and treatment are available  and  that  the
"appellant has a number of relatives in the UK who  can  assist  in  funding
the treatment".

The judge dismissed the appeal.

Before us Mr Sellwood closely followed his  written  submissions.   That  is
wholly appropriate.  They are clear and are meant to  be  read  but  we  did
consider his oral submissions too.

Mr Sellwood had prepared 9 grounds of appeal. To some  extent  they  overlap
and we have not considered them each separately. We have  read  the  Renewal
Grounds as well as the grounds supporting  the  application  for  permission
from the First-tier Tribunal. We have  used  the  numbers  on  the  earliest
grounds.

We confirm that we have considered Mr Tarlow's  brief  submissions  and  the
Rule 24 Notice provided.

For reasons that are explained below we find that there have  been  material
errors. Where we have redetermined issues we have  reminded  ourselves  that
the appellant must prove his case but when determining risk on return it  is
sufficient if he shows that there is a "real risk" to his human rights.

Ground 1 asserts that the judge did  not  take  account  of  the  background
material, ground 2 says that the judge did not separate  the  two  limbs  in
the "article 3 claims", namely that the appellant risked  article  3  severe
ill-treatment in the event of his  return  and,  additionally,  should  have
consider if removing him in  his  state  of  health  was  contrary  to  this
article 3 rights. Ground 3 complains  that  the  judge  misdirected  herself
when considering the "health" claim. Ground 4  alleges  a  failure  to  make
sound findings of  fact.  Ground  5  alleges  a  failure  to  apply  country
guidance. Ground 6 alleges a failure to consider the medical evidence  about
treatment that was available in Somaliland. Ground 7  alleges  a  conflation
of the tests concerning  article  3  and  article  8.  Ground  8  alleges  a
misdirection concerning article 9. Ground 9 alleges an unlawful  failure  to
consider post-decision evidence.

For reasons which we hope will  become  apparent,  we  begin  at  ground  4,
alleging a failure to make sound findings.

The judge's decision to dismiss the appeal  is  premised  on  the  appellant
being able to access support in the country to which he would  be  returned.
We find no justification for the finding that the  appellant  has  relatives
who would assist in  supporting  him  financially.  The  evidence  does  not
justify such a conclusion.

The appellant's mother gave clear  evidence  that  she  cannot  support  the
appellant. She is disabled and depends on benefits. They  are  set  to  meet
her needs. They cannot be expected to give her a  surplus.  The  appellant's
father gave evidence that he gets  casual  work  attending  an  airport  car
park. He also receives job seekers allowance when his not working. It is  no
way to his discredit that he cannot earn more but there is no  surplus  from
him to subsidise that appellant.

The appellant lives with two unmarried sisters. One  them  is  employed  and
uses some of her modest income to support her mother. The  appellant  has  a
married sister and a married brother and another brother who  is  living  in
Ethiopia where he is almost destitute. There is nothing to suggest that  the
appellant's relatives are able to provide long term  support  even  if  they
were so inclined. None of this was undermined by contrary evidence and  none
of it is implausible.

Further the appellant's mother said  that  the  family  had  no  links  with
Somaliland and there were no clan or similar links that  could  be  expected
to provide much support.

We have no good reason to reject these claims. We find that  the  First-tier
Tribunal Judge was not entitled to conclude  that  the  appellant  would  be
supported in Somaliland. The evidence can only support a conclusion that  he
cannot be maintained from the United Kingdom.

We have considered the evidence about how the appellant could  cope  in  the
event of his return.

The judge is criticised in the  grounds  for  not  making  clearer  findings
about how much the appellant depends on  his  family.  We  see  considerable
justification in that criticism. We have looked at the evidence  behind  the
findings that the appellant "currently lives with his family and appears  to
have some support"  We  have  already  noted  the  judge's  summary  of  the
evidence.

In her  statement  the  appellant's  mother  referred  to  his  needing  his
relatives to check that he has taken his medicine, to  help  him  dress  and
keep clean and to aid in the event of  a  "fit",  something  that  she  said
happened nearly every week. His family in the United Kingdom was  not  in  a
position to send funds to Somaliland.

In his own statement the appellant wrote about his mother or sister  cooking
and washing for him. He never used an iron lest he had  a  fit  and  injured
himself.

There are also papers from MN  Homecare  Services  where  the  appellant  is
recorded as saying "I am able to mobilise independently however I will  need
supervision from my carer due to my seizures".

The judge clearly found that the appellant relied on his  family  to  assist
with his dressing, laundry, cooking, bathing and taking medication.

Whilst the appellant might, to  some  extent,  have  been  indulged  by  his
sister and mother it also clear that he could not manage on his own  without
a real risk of things going wrong, especially the ever present risk  of  his
fitting and then injuring himself.

The judge has not  made  any  sustainable  findings  about  the  appellant's
economic  circumstances.  The  appellant  is  unemployed   and,   we   find,
unemployable because of the combined disabling  effects  of  his  alcoholism
and epilepsy. At the best he might be able to obtain very modest work  in  a
sheltered environment but there is no reason  to  anticipate  his  obtaining
such work in Somaliland.

We find that  the  appellant  would  find  it  very  difficult  to  cope  in
Somaliland. He would not be able to earn a living. He would not be  able  to
access adequate medication reliably and he would not be able to  look  after
himself. His prospects are grim.

We note that it was established in the first appeal that the appellant  came
from Somaliland. He disagrees with that. We remind  ourselves  that  it  was
only on the morning of the hearing that the respondent committed himself  to
returning the appellant to  Somaliland  rather  than  Somalia  so  there  no
obvious advantage in persisting in a dishonest claim not to have  come  from
there. We cannot go behind that finding on the basis of evidence not  tested
before us but the finding that the appellant came from Somaliland nearly  30
years ago when his relatives were desperate to get  out  is  not  a  finding
that there are relatives there who are willing to support him now. There  is
no evidence that there are such people and we find that there are not.

We want to emphasise that the appellant is only able to cope to  the  extent
that he does because he gets significant social  support,  mainly  from  his
mother and sisters but significantly from paid carers. That  care  will  not
be replicated in Somaliland.

We are required to predict if there is a real risk of ill treatment.

We find it is likely that after a short time the  combined  effects  of  the
appellant's epilepsy, alcoholism (whether or not he is able to  indulge  his
cravings), unreliable supply of medication that is less than ideal  and  his
(with respect) very low IQ mean that he can be expected to deteriorate in  a
very short times scale to being isolated, destitute and  seriously  ill.  We
have no hesitation in saying there  is  a  reasonable  likelihood  that  the
appellant in the event of return to Somaliland will be perceived as  someone
with psychosocial  disabilities  and  will  risk  treatment  that  would  be
regarded as abusive.  We say this because of his very poor personal  skills,
his  inability  to  control  adequately  his  epileptic  condition  and  the
aggravating effectors of alcoholism.  If in the United Kingdom  where  there
is family support and considerable support  from  the  state  and  excellent
medical advice readily available to him he is still  prone  to  fitting  and
risks hurting himself we do not see how there can be any realistic  prospect
of his  not  fitting  and  becoming  a  danger  to  himself  and  others  in
Somaliland.

Having made this finding it is convenient to consider ground 1, the  alleged
failure to consider background material.

The  judge  was  required  to  consider  the  report  "Human  Rights  Watch,
"Somaliland: People with Disabilities Abused, Neglected", 24  October  2015.
The report refers to there  being  only  two  psychiatrists  for  about  3.5
million people. Clearly this is not remotely enough to provide proper care.

Much more importantly for present purposes it referred to a detailed  report
"Chained  Like  Prisoners':  Abuses   Against   People   with   Psychosocial
Disabilities in Somaliland." This found that men with  perceived  or  actual
psychosocial  disabilities  face  abusive  restrains,  beating,  involuntary
treatment, and overcrowding in private and public health centres.  Most  are
held against their  will  and  have  no  possibility  of  challenging  their
detention.  In  private  centres  in  particular,  those  with  psychosocial
disabilities face punitive and prolonged chaining,  confinement,  seclusion,
and severe restrictions on their  movement".  The  same  report  notes  that
"most" of a sample of 115 people  in  such  institutions  had  faced  abuse.
There was no means of judicial oversight.

Further,  whilst  chaining  was  seen  as  a  greater  problem  in   private
institutions it was not limited to them and  involuntary  detention  without
redress was characteristic of both private and public institutions.

Human Rights Watch reports can be expected to  be  well  researched  and  we
accept what it says.

We find that in the  event  of  return  to  Somaliland  there  is  a  strong
likelihood (although a real risk  is  sufficient)  of  the  appellant  being
detained against  his  will  indefinitely  without  legal  redress  in  poor
conditions and there  is  a  real  risk  of  his  suffering  the  additional
degradation of being chained.

We must ask ourselves if  the  real  risk  of  his  being  exposed  to  such
treatment violates his "article 3 rights".

This is a convenient place to consider  ground  2  alleging  a  misdirection
concerning the claim that removing the appellant would violate  his  article
3 rights.

We agree with the First-tier Tribunal that the appellant  cannot  show  that
removing him to a country where health care is well below  the  standard  to
be expected in the United Kingdom contravenes his article 3  rights.  It  is
almost trite law that the United Kingdom is  not  obliged  to  provide  high
quality care to all comers.

There is a distinction here that the First-tier Tribunal did not bring  out.
The concern  is  not  just  that  the  appellant  will  not  get  very  good
treatment. He will not. He will, we find, be  locked  up  without  trial  or
legal redress and that there is a real risk of his being locked  in  chains.
Such  detention,  with  or  without  chaining,  is  "inhuman  or   degrading
treatment". The appeal should have been allowed on article 3 grounds.

Ground 3 alleges  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  erred  in  not  following
Paposhvili v Belgium (App No 41738/10) but that  is  not  binding  authority
and unless and until the  Court  of  Appeal  says  otherwise,  the  Tribunal
cannot apply it because it conflicts with national law.

Nevertheless we have considered its likely implications.  We  have  provided
ourselves at paragraph 183 in Paposhvili where the court decided:

  "The court considers that the 'other very exceptional cases'  within  the
  meaning of the judgment in N. v The United Kingdom (�43) which may  raise
  an issue under Article 3 should be  understood  to  refer  to  situations
  involving the removing of a seriously ill  person  in  which  substantial
  grounds have been shown for believing that he or  she,  although  not  at
  imminent risk of dying, would face a real risk on account of the  absence
  of appropriate treatment in the receiving country or the lack  of  access
  to such treatment, of being exposed to a serious, rapid and  irreversible
  decline in his or her state of health resulting in intense  suffering  or
  to a significant reduction in life expectancy.  The court points out that
  these situations correspond to a high threshold for  the  application  of
  Article 3 of the Convention in cases concerning  the  removal  of  aliens
  suffering from serious illness."

We do not see this case within the scope of the concerns in Paposhvili.  The
likely decline in health (something we accept)  cannot  be  expected  to  be
linked immediately with removal in the  way  that  might  be  expected,  for
example, in the case of a person dependant on  a  kidney  dialysis  machine.
The problem is not the actions of the United Kingdom but of poor  conditions
in the country of return.

Ground 5 is irrelevant. Now that it is clear that  the  appellant  would  be
removed to Somaliland there is no error in not  following  country  guidance
relevant in the event of return to Somalia.

Ground 6 concerns medical treatment and adds nothing.

Ground 7 is made out. The judge was required to  consider  the  claim  under
article 8 and was required when so doing to apply part 5 of  the  2002  Act.
There is no clear finding of "engagement" and then "balance" in  the  First-
tier Tribunal's decision.

We make it plain that we have not emphasised the "public interest"  half  of
the article 8 balance because it is not in dispute and not because  we  have
ignored it. It is clear that there  is  a  strong  public  interest  in  the
appellant being deported.

We find that that interest is  enhanced  in  this  case  by  reason  of  his
propensity to reoffend.  We  remind  ourselves  that  an  appeal  against  a
decision to deport the appellant had been dismissed  in  July  2010  and  an
appeal against that decision was dismissed on 20 December 2010.

Nevertheless he was convicted in October 2011 of theft from shops and  of  a
similar offence in December 2011 and again in November 2013. Essentially  he
stole to fund his drug and alcohol abuse.

He sustained a head injury in 2013.

He was convicted of being drunk and disorderly and of  assaulting  a  police
officer in January 2014.

He was convicted of common assault in  January  2015  (even  though  he  was
pursuing an application to revoke the deportation order) and in  August  and
then September 2015 he was again convicted of being drunk and disorderly.

We are not aware of any further convictions but it  is  clear  that  neither
the injury in 2013 nor the need to impress the  authorities  with  his  good
behaviour have previously made him behave.

We acknowledge that he more recent offending is less serious than the  older
offending  but  persistently  drunk  behaviour,  which  is  unpleasant   and
sometimes frightening for bystanders, can very  easily  escalate  into  much
more serious crime. The appellant can be  expected  to  engage  in  criminal
behaviour which, at its best, is a nuisance and  which  could  easily  be  a
bigger threat to public order. In any event  the  prospect  of  future  good
behaviour is not a reason to allow an appeal  such  as  this  although  they
might make it permissible to allow an appeal where there are  other  reasons
for so doing.

The appellant cannot rely on any close relationships. The United Kingdom  is
not obliged to promote family life between adults in the absence of  special
ties that do not exist here.

He does not come within the terms of Exception 1 or Exception 2  of  Part  5
of the 2002 Act. He is not integrated into British society.

Nevertheless we do allow the appeal on article 8 grounds.

Clearly he has established  a  "private  and  family  life"  in  the  United
Kingdom. It is also clear  that  he  is  reliant  on  his  close  relatives'
support and so we enhance the weight that we give  to  those  relationships.
They are not just the relationships between adults who are closely  related.
The appellant depends  on  them  for  his  care.  However  they  still  less
important than the relationship between parents and minor children  or  life
partners and would not outweigh the public interest in his removal.

That said there are compelling reasons here, namely the risk  of  his  being
subjected to so such serious ill treatment in the event of his  return  that
it would contravene his right under article 3 of the ECHR. Further, even  if
we are wrong and the predicted indignities do not reach article 3  level  we
find that they are such a violation of  his  physical  and  moral  integrity
that they outweigh the strong public interest in his removal.

It follows that grounds 7 and 8 are made out. This is one of  the  very  few
deportation cases that falls to be allowed for the  sake  of  the  appellant
rather than the rights of a close family member of the appellant.

Ground 9 alleges that the First-tier Tribunal  wrongly  failed  to  consider
post decision medical evidence. It is not clear that it  ever  came  to  her
attention. If it had it would have supported our findings  on  the  evidence
that was before the First-tier Tribunal  about  the  difficulties  that  the
appellant would face in establish himself in Somaliland. The  alleged  error
is not material.

Decision

For the reasons given we find that the First-tier Tribunal erred in law.  We
set aside its decision and substitute a decision  allowing  the  appellant's
appeal against the respondent's decision.
