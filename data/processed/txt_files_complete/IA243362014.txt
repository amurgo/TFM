                            DECISION AND REASONS


Introduction


 1. I refer to the parties as they were in the First-tier Tribunal although
    it is the respondent who is appealing in these proceedings.

 2. The appellant is a national of India, born on 10th June 1989.

 3.  She came to the United Kingdom on 20 September 2013 as a visitor. She
    states that on 2nd October 2013 she met Mr Nayee, a British national
    whose family originated in India.   On the 8th November 2013 they
    married. Her visa was to expire on 31 January 2014.On the 28 January
    2014 she applied for further leave to remain as a spouse.

 4. Her application was refused on 28th January 2014 on the basis paragraph
    276 ADE and appendixes FM of the rules were not met.

 5. Her appeal was heard by Judge Clemes of the First-tier Tribunal sitting
    at Newport on 22 January 2015. In a decision promulgated on 17 February
    2015 the appeal was allowed on the basis paragraph EX.1 (b) of Appendix
    FM applied. The judge found there were insurmountable obstacles to
    family life continuing outside the United Kingdom. Because of this the
    judge did not go on to make a finding on private life under paragraph
    276 ADE and the question of the appellant's ability to integrate to
    life in India.

 6. The case made on appeal was that Mr Nayee was the sole carer of his
    mother who suffered from poor health. Because of his caring commitment
    he worked part-time. Since his marriage, his wife had shared the caring
    role which meant he was able to work full-time, earning ï¿½18,360 per
    annum. He had siblings but they have their own commitments.

 7. The appellant indicated she was an only child and her father died in
    2007 and her mother remarried. When she was 18 she went to Australia
    and married. She returned to India a few years later and obtained a
    divorce. She is from Mumbai and speaks English and Hindi. Her husband
    has been brought up in the United Kingdom. His family are from Gujarat
    but he has little knowledge of India having only visit for a few
    holidays and has a limited command of Gujarati.

 8. The judge concluded there were insurmountable obstacles to family life
    continuing outside the United Kingdom. Reference was made to linguistic
    and cultural difficulties for Mr Nayee if he were to live in India. In
    addition he had his caring responsibilities.

 9. The respondent sought leave to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on the
    basis the decision was premised on material errors of law. Firstly, the
    appellant came to the United Kingdom as a visitor and so E-LTRPL 2.1(a)
    applied. At paragraph 3 of the decision the judge referred to the
    statutory provisions but did not apply them correctly. Reference was
    made to Sabir (app FM-EXI. Not freestanding)[2014UKUT 63. Secondly, the
    judge did not adequately explain what the insurmountable obstacles were
    that prevented life continuing in India. There was no finding on the
    ability of either Mr Nayee's siblings or third parties to care for his
    mother in his absence. There were no findings as to her care needs.  Mr
    Nayee had been able to care for his mother on his own by reducing his
    hours of work. It was contended that the appellant and her husband
    could return to India and she could seek employment and he could
    improve his linguistic skills.

The Upper Tribunal

10. Judge Clemes materially erred in law in allowing the appeal on the
    basis paragraph EX.1 (b) of Appendix FM applied. This is because the
    appellant was here as a visitor. Consequently, I set the decision aside
    and proceeded to remake it.

11. The appellant and her husband gave evidence. The appellant is expecting
    her first child on or about 22 October 2015. She is hoping for a
    natural birth but this would be subject to her medical condition.  She
    was noted to have high blood pressure and pre-eclampsia. The birth may
    have to be induced or a Caesarean section required. She said her mother
    is in India and after the appellant's father died in 2007 she remarried
    in 2012 and her stepfather was not welcoming. On the 23rd July 2007 the
    appellant married and she and her husband went to live in Australia.
    They separated after two years and she returned to India were she
    obtained a divorce on the 16th September 2013. She lived on her own and
    used savings and maintenance from her husband. In the past she worked
    in sales and as a model.

12. The appellant and her husband described how his mother was. I was told
    that she requires oxygen around 15 hours per day. Her mobility is
    restricted and she has problems with bladder control. She was on 21
    tablets per day. Her doctor advised reducing the intake of steroids.
    However, as the medication is withdrawn she experiences dizzy spells.

13. Mr Nayee said that his father suffered a series of strokes whilst on
    holiday in India and died. Mr Nayee promised him he would take care of
    his mother. He is her youngest child. He has two brothers. He said his
    older brother is estranged from the family because he blames his mother
    for his father's death. In oral evidence he states that one of his
    brothers is living in America. This must have been a recent move
    because in his statement of 19 January 2015 at paragraph 3 he indicates
    all his siblings are settled in the United Kingdom. In oral evidence he
    said his sister lives about 20 minutes drive from the family home .She
    is married and has three children. She works as a receptionist in a
    local hospital. He said that his mother does not speak English and
    spends her time in prayer. He said that a care package had been in
    place which consisted of two calls per day lasting one hour each.
    However, his mother did not like people calling, particularly as she
    could not communicate with them and this was discontinued.

14. In submissions, Mr.Nath argued that a care package had been in place
    before and could be reinstated if the appellant and her husband went to
    India. The appellant had been able to live independently in India
    before. He highlighted the precariousness of her immigration status
    when they married. It was open to her to apply for re-entry from India
    as a spouse. I was referred to the public interest, consideration set
    out in section 117.

15. Mr Singh submitted that the appeal should be allowed under article 8.
    He questioned whether it was proportionate to require the appellant to
    return to India and reapply for entry clearance particularly if she had
    a child. He submitted that her husband could not go to India with her
    because his mother depended on him to give her medication and explain
    things that were said in English. She submitted the Home Office by its
    decision, was requiring Mr Nayee to choose between his mother and wife.
    He queried how Mr Nayee's mother's needs could be met if he were not
    here. He also argued I should have regard to the best interests of the
    appellant's unborn child who would be entitled to British nationality.
    He pointed out that the appellant spoke English and the family were
    financially independent.

 Consideration.

16. The appellant cannot meet the immigration rules because of her
    immigration status (see Sabir (Appendix FM)-EX.1 not free standing)
    [2014] UKUT 63). She relies upon a freestanding article 8 claim. It is
    not in dispute that the relationship between the appellant and her
    husband is genuine. The issue in the appeal relates to the final limb
    of the sequential approach in Razgar.


17. The first observation I make and on which I place particular weight is
    the fact that when the appellant married she was here on a visitor
    Visa. This was due to expire two and a half months after her marriage.
    Therefore, she and her husband were aware her immigration status was
    precarious.


18. Mr Nayee chose to marry. He was aware of his mother's needs. He would
    have known the likely consequence would be that his wife would have to
    return to India and reapply for entry clearance. Alternatively he could
    accompany her and live with her in India either until her application
    for entry clearance was decided or reside there long term.

19. The medical evidence submitted indicates his mother has poor health.
    She is 75 years old. She was hospitalised for four days in December
    2014 with a chest infection. She has chronic medical conditions and her
    respiratory condition is such that she requires the use of a home
    nebuliser. Her GP in a letter dated 24th January 2014 states she has
    the lung condition, hypersensitivity pneumonitis; type 2 diabetes and
    epilepsy.


20. In the past she was provided with a home care package. If her son were
    to go to India she would require help if she was to remain at home. She
    has a daughter who lives nearby. Whilst her daughter has her own
    commitments I see no reason why she could not provide some help to her
    mother and supervise third-party care. A care package could be
    organised through her GP and a social worker. She does not have a
    command of the English language and so there are some special needs.
    However, her daughter could provide the necessary stimulation and
    checks on her mother. If the appellant and her husband were to go to
    India and no other family member took on the caring role there is the
    possibility of care in a residential or nursing home. I can appreciate
    that Mr Nayee is anxious for his mother to remain at home. However, the
    dilemma he faces was through his own choice.

21. The appellant has lived independently in India. She is educated to
    degree level. Her husband has an appreciation of Indian culture through
    his family background. He has some knowledge of Gujarati and can
    communicate with his mother, who has limited English. He has trained as
    an optical consultant.

22. I am required to have regard to the consideration set out in section
    117.In AM (S 117B) Malawi [2015]UKUT 290 , the Upper Tribunal noted the
    distinction between a person  in the United Kingdom unlawfully and that
    of someone whose  immigration status has been precarious. Section 117 B
    (4) provides little weight should be given to a relationship form with
    a qualifying partner established when the person was in the United
    Kingdom unlawfully. The appellant was not in the country unlawfully.
    Rather her immigration status was precarious. A person has a precarious
    immigration status if they are dependent upon obtaining a further grant
    of leave. Section 117 (B)(5) which provides that  little weight should
    be given where the persons status is precarious only applies in respect
    of private life. The Upper Tribunal at paragraph 14 pointed out that
    section 117 B did not grant any form of immigration status on an
    individual who does not meet the immigration rules on the basis of
    having a good command of English or being financially independent.

23. In Hayat (nature of Chikwamba principle) Pakistan [2011] UKUT 444 (IAC)
    it was held that the significance of Chikwamba v SSHD [2008] UKHL 40
    was that in appeals where the only matter weighing on the respondent's
    side of an Article 8 proportionality balance is the public policy of
    requiring an application to be made under the Immigration Rules from
    abroad, that the legitimate objective will usually be outweighed by
    factors resting on the appellant's side of the balance.  This is not
    the situation here and to expect the appellant to return to India and
    reapply for entry clearance is not being obtuse. The immigration rules
    provide for entry clearance as a fiancï¿½ or as a spouse provided the
    requirements are met. The appellant did not choose this route but in
    effect is attempting to short-circuit the process.

24. Mr Singh has submitted that I should have regard to the best interests
    of the appellant's unborn child who would be entitled British
    nationality. Section 55 is not an anticipatory provision. However, had
    the child been born my view would have been unchanged. It is
    acknowledged that in general the best interests of a child are to be
    with both parents. The case law emphasises the significance of British
    nationality. In this instance what may be in the best interests of the
    as yet unborn child is outweighed by the need for immigration control.
    In the circumstance it is proportionate to expect the appellant to
    return to India. She can be accompanied by her husband as he so
    decides. There is the option of applying for entry clearance under the
    rules whereby the family can be reunited in the United Kingdom.




Decision

25. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did involve a material error of
    law. I set aside that decision.

26. I remake the decision. The appeal is dismissed under the immigration
    rules and there is no breach of article 8.

Anonymity

27. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order for anonymity. No
    application for such an order has been made before me. I see no reason
    of substance for making one
