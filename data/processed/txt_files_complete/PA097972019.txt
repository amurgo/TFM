                          DECISION AND REASONS (V)



For the appellant:     Mr A McVeety, Senior Presenting Officer

For the Respondent:    Ms R Head, instructed by Montecristo LLP



This  has  been  a  remote  hearing  which  has   been   consented   to by
the parties. The form of remote hearing was video by Skype (V). A face-to-
face hearing was not held because it was not  practicable,  and  all  issues
could be determined in a remote hearing. At the conclusion of  the  hearing,
I explained that I found no error of law in the decision of  the  First-tier
Tribunal,  reserving  my  reasons,  which  I  now  give.  The   order   made
is described at the end of these reasons.


 1. To avoid confusion, for the purpose of this decision  I  have  referred
    below to the parties as they were before the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The appellant is a  Chinese  national  with  date  of  birth  given  as
    19.5.85, who first arrived in the UK as a student in 2010 and  who  was
    subsequently granted further limited leave to remain, latterly  as  the
    spouse of a settled person.

 3. The Secretary of State  has  appealed  with  permission  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal against the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  promulgated
    4.9.20 (Judge Bird), dismissing  on  asylum  grounds  but  allowing  on
    Article 3 human rights grounds,  the  appellant's  appeal  against  the
    decision of the Secretary  of  State,  dated  30.9.19,  to  refuse  her
    international protection  and human rights claims and to  maintain  the
    deportation decision made following her conviction in  2017  for  money
    laundering offences, for which she  was  sentenced  to  a  term  of  75
    months' imprisonment.

 4. Although the respondent had issued  a  s72  certificate  excluding  the
    appellant from asylum and  humanitarian  protection,  at  [37]  of  the
    impugned  decision  the  judge  concluded  that   the   appellant   had
    successfully rebutted the presumption in that  there  was  no  evidence
    that she was a danger to the community. However, it does not appear  to
    have  been  disputed  that  the  appellant's  claim  fell  outside  the
    protection of the Refugee Convention, with which the  judge  agreed  at
    [57] of the decision. However, the judge found that there  was  a  real
    likelihood that the appellant would on return be subjected to treatment
    breaching her article 3 ECHR  rights,  in  that  there  was  a  "strong
    likelihood" that she would be prosecuted by the Chinese authorities and
    that "the term of imprisonment imposed is likely to be persecutory."

 5. In summary, the grounds submit that the First-tier Tribunal Judge  made
    a material misdirection in law and failed to give adequate reasons  for
    findings made. Complaint is made as to aggravating factors found by the
    judge, including that the appellant was a member of the Communist Party
    when China is a Communist Party country.

 6. Permission  to  appeal  was  granted  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  on
    26.10.20, the judge being "satisfied that there is an arguable error of
    law in the decision in that the Judge may  not  have  properly  applied
    (the) guidance in YF (double jeopardy -JC confirmed) China [2011]  UKUT
    32 (IAC). In particular it is unclear, given that China is a  Communist
    state, as to why the appellant being a member of  the  Communist  Party
    would be an aggravating factor. Further, the  Judge  made  findings  in
    relation to  the  appellant's  mother  than  may  well  not  have  been
    available to her on the evidence.  In  addition,  there  is  no  proper
    indication as to how the Judge can find that the article printed in the
    press would come to the attention of the Chinese authorities."

 7. The Upper Tribunal has received the undated  'appellant's  response  to
    respondent's review', drafted in the form of a witness  statement,  and
    an undated skeleton argument.  The  first  document  was  sent  to  the
    Tribunal under cover of an email on 7.12.20. There is also  an  undated
    witness statement from  the  sponsor.  Ms  Head  confirmed  that  these
    materials were prepared for the  First-tier  Tribunal  appeal  hearing.
    However,  my  attention  was  drawn  to  the  further  bundle  prepared
    specifically for this hearing, including Ms Head's 'Reply to  the  SSHD
    Grounds'. I have carefully considered these materials  and  taken  them
    into account as appropriate.  I  have  also  carefully  considered  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal  in  the  light  of  the  oral  and
    written submissions and the grounds of application  for  permission  to
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal.

 8. The appellant's human rights claim was that  on  return  to  China  she
    would face re-prosecution for the  serious  money  laundering  offences
    which will be considered to  have  embarrassed  China.  YF  found  that
    absent particular aggravating factors, the risk falls  well  below  the
    level required to engage international  protection  under  the  Refugee
    Convention, the ECHR or humanitarian protection. The  appellant's  case
    as advanced by Ms Head at the First-tier  Tribunal,  as  recorded  from
    [42] of the decision, was that  there  were  a  number  of  aggravating
    factors, including that the  Chinese  authorities  were  aware  of  the
    appellant's conviction and that there  had  been  considerable  adverse
    publicity so that the Chinese authorities had questioned her mother and
    frozen the mother's bank accounts, and  'requested'  the  appellant  to
    contact the police on her return to China.

 9. The essence of Mr McVeety's submissions were two-fold. First  that  the
    expert evidence should not have been given the weight it  was  accorded
    by the  First-tier  Tribunal,  particularly  given  that  the  expert's
    evidence was rejected in YF. Second, that the judge should have made  a
    more careful assessment of the alleged aggravating factors said to lift
    the appellant's case above the YF threshold.

10. The respondent's case as drafted in the grounds is weak and borders  on
    a disagreement with the decision and an attempt to reargue the  appeal.
    At the hearing before me, Mr McVeety acknowledged that arguments  about
    article 8 and very compelling circumstances were unlikely  to  succeed.
    Further, he accepted that the grounds misunderstand  the  relevance  of
    the appellant's Communist Party membership. He accepted that her status
    as a Party member and the fact that her father was a local chairman  of
    the Party raised her profile  and  that  the  Chinese  authorities  may
    regard her criminal offending with greater seriousness as she  will  be
    held to a higher standard. Mr McVeety also accepted that the  Sing  Tao
    Chinese language newspaper is widely acknowledged to  be  the  official
    mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party in Europe  and  as  such  its
    contents including an article about the appellant would be known to the
    Chinese authorities.

11. Whilst the  First-tier  Tribunal  decision  could  have  addressed  the
    alleged aggravating factors more carefully,  I  agree  with  Ms  Head's
    submission that the respondent has been unable to point to any specific
    misdirection in law. In reality, the judge accepted  all  the  asserted
    aggravating factors, including the mother's evidence supported by  bank
    documents. The appellant's money laundering offences involved  over  ï¿½2
    million and not only UK banks but Chinese banks and Chinese  nationals,
    to whom money transfers were made. The judge accepted that the  adverse
    publicity would have come to the attention of the  Chinese  authorities
    and that her position as an official Communist Party  member  increased
    the risk for her.

12. Considering the decision as a whole, whilst a different judge may  have
    reached a different conclusion, I cannot say that the findings or their
    supporting  reasoning  were  made  irrationally  or  perversely.  I  am
    satisfied that on the evidence those findings were open to  the  judge.
    The grounds do not  demonstrate  any  material  error  of  law.  In  MR
    (permission to appeal: Tribunal's approach) Brazil  [2015]  UKUT  00029
    (IAC) the Upper Tribunal held that, "A judge considering an application
    for permission to appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal  must  avoid  granting
    permission on what, properly analysed, is no more than a simple quarrel
    with the First-tier  Tribunal  judge's  assessment  of  the  evidence."
    Similarly, in Herrera v SSHD [2018] EWCA Civ 412, the Court  of  Appeal
    said  that  it  is  necessary  to  guard  against  the  temptation   to
    characterise  as  errors  of  law  what  are  in  truth  no  more  than
    disagreements about the  weight  to  be  given  to  different  factors,
    particularly if the judge who decided the appeal had the  advantage  of
    hearing oral evidence. It is well-established law that the weight to be
    given to any particular factor in an appeal is a matter for  the  judge
    and will rarely give rise to an error of law, see Green (Article 8 -new
    rules) [2013] UKUT 254. Further, the Court  of  Appeal  has  repeatedly
    explained  the  caution  to  be  exercised  by  appellate   courts   in
    interfering with evaluative decisions  of  first  instance  judges,  as
    stated by Lewison LJ in Fage UK Ltd. v Chobani UK Ltd. [2014] EWCA Civ
    5 at [114].

13. In the circumstances and for the reasons  set  out  above,  I  find  no
    material error of law in the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  so
    that it must be set aside.



Decision

    The appeal  of  the  Secretary  of  State  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  is
    dismissed.

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands and the  appeal  remains
    allowed.

    I make no order for costs.
