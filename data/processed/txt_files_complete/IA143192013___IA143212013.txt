                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS



 1. This is an appeal from a determination of  4  September  this  year  by
    Judge Jackson, sitting in the First-tier Tribunal.   She  dismissed  an
    appeal against a decision of the Secretary of State dated earlier  this
    year to refuse the grant of further  leave  to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom by the first appellant in relation to his application to remain
    as a Tier 1 Entrepreneur.  The second appellant is  his  dependant  and
    the two cases succeed or fall together.

 2. The background is that  the  appellants  are  from  India.   The  first
    appellant, now 36 years old, first came here with valid entry clearance
    and leave to remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student in October 2008.   He
    was a vet and obtained an MSc  at  Hertfordshire  University.   He  was
    subsequently granted further leave to remain as  a  Tier  1  (Post-Work
    Study) Migrant until October last year.  The second appellant  was  his
    dependant.

 3. The first appellant's application form named the  second  appellant  as
    his dependant and named Mr Shivakumar Shyleshkumar as the other  member
    of the entrepreneurial team.  In this judgment we  will  call  him  the
    "business partner".  The application  form  contained  details  of  the
    funds available for investment, the  job  title  given  was  Laboratory
    Manager and  a  firm  of  solicitors  were  named  as  the  appellant's
    representatives.  The appellant claimed points pursuant to the  points-
    based system.

 4. The Secretary of State refused the application  in  April  as  we  have
    said.  In the course of the refusal letter  mention  was  made  of  the
    failure to provide the name or name  of  the  partner  on  the  website
    printout and business card pursuant to the Immigration Rules, paragraph
    41-SD-C3 of Appendix A.  It was also said that the first appellant  had
    not provided details of contracts detailing the services to confirm the
    business he was engaged in.  The Secretary  of  State  also  said  that
    there was a failure in relation to the details of third party funding.

 5. The appellants appealed.  The matter came before the judge.  There  was
    a  witness  statement  provided  by  Mr  Shivakumar  Shyleshkumar,  the
    business partner, albeit that it was unsigned and undated.   The  judge
    at the outset considered a request for an adjournment by  Ms  Watterson
    who appears for the appellants today.  The basis of the application was
    that the business partner had made an application for leave  to  remain
    as well as a Tier 1 Entrepreneur based on the same  business  but  that
    his refusal had only just been issued  and  that  the  hearing  of  his
    appeal would not occur until April 2014.  Thus it was said that the two
    cases were inextricably linked and it would be undesirable for the  two
    to be heard on different occasions with the risk of a different result.



 6. The judge refused the adjournment for three  reasons.   First  he  said
    that there was the witness statement  from  the  business  partner  and
    there was no missing evidence or view of  the  business  partner  which
    would be needed to determine the appeal before him.  Secondly, she said
    although it could be  said  that  there  was  a  possibility  that  two
    different judges might determine  the  appeal  differently,  there  was
    nothing in her view to suggest that in the present  case  there  was  a
    real likelihood of that occurring.  These were appeals based under  the
    Immigration Rules on the points-based system and that  system  set  out
    objective criteria to be met for the grant of leave to remain  and  the
    appeals were primarily addressed by reference to documentary  evidence.
    Thirdly, she said that although the business partner's appeal had  been
    listed for April 2014 it was not in the interests of justice  to  delay
    the current appeals to fairly determine them.  She then went on to make
    certain findings.

 7. Firstly, she said that the  first  appellant's  name  was  sufficiently
    identifiable.  Secondly, she said  that  in  relation  to  third  party
    funding she  could  not  accept  the  submissions  that  the  documents
    contained all the specified information.  Thirdly,  she  accepted  that
    there were real difficulties in producing contracts showing trading  as
    required by paragraph 41-SD-(c)(iv) of the Rules.  She  described  this
    as a catch 22 situation in which it  was  difficult  for  a  person  to
    demonstrate that they had contracts when a third party was unlikely  to
    contract with someone who had no current leave to remain.

 8. She then considered paragraphs 46  to  51  of  the  determination,  the
    Article 8 position.  She focused as was natural  on  the  private  life
    aspect.  She said that if the appellants  did  have  private  life  and
    could show that the interference was of sufficient gravity  nonetheless
    in relation to the evidence that  the  appellants  were  to  set  up  a
    business with ï¿½50,000 to invest, there was no evidence about the likely
    success of that business or its contribution to  the  economy  nor  was
    there any indication of it creating additional employment.

 9. She then went on to consider the  proportionality  assessment  required
    under Article 8 and identified  the  fact  that  the  appellants  could
    easily return to India, that they had spent the majority of their lives
    there, they had  gained  qualifications  here  which  they  could  then
    transfer and that what had happened was that the first appellant had in
    effect established a Shell Company which was not yet trading.

10. Before us Ms Watterson in clear and cogent submissions has taken us  to
    the Rules relevant to the judge's exercise of discretion in relation to
    the adjournment.  She  has  pointed  to  Rule  20  of  the  Asylum  and
    Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005 dealing with the hearing of
    two or more appeals together which gives the Tribunal a power to direct
    that that occur when there is some common question of law  or  fact  if
    for some other reason it is desirable  for  the  appeals  to  be  heard
    together.  Rule 21  deals  with  the  adjournment  of  appeals  and  in
    particular says that where a  party  applies  for  an  adjournment  the
    Tribunal must not adjourn  unless  satisfied  that  the  appeal  cannot
    otherwise be justly determined.   Ms  Watterson  identified  a  tension
    between the two Rules but in this case she submitted the judge  was  in
    error not to have  adjourned  the  hearing.   Although  Rule  21  leant
    against  unnecessary  adjournments  they  were  permitted   where   the
    interests of justice required that and in this  case  she  submitted  a
    joint appeal involving both the appellants  and  the  business  partner
    would meet the overriding objectives of the Rules since that  would  be
    more fair and efficient.  The injustice in this case not  only  applied
    to these appellants but, she said and indeed she submitted at one point
    that this might be her best point, that the injustice extended also  to
    the business partner in that the inextricable  connection  between  the
    two applications for leave meant that if the first  appellant's  appeal
    succeeded then his appeal would succeed and vice versa.  She underlined
    the disadvantages in terms of the  Article  8  assessment  because  the
    business partner could well have given evidence about the viability  of
    the proposed business which would  have  strengthened  the  appellant's
    case.  She directed us in particular to the determination by the  judge
    where the judge had decided in favour of the first appellant's case  in
    relation  to  certain  aspects  of  the   points-based   system   which
    demonstrated that in fact it was not the  objective  system  which  the
    judge had characterised it as  has  been.   In  our  view  the  judge's
    decision on the adjournment cannot  be  faulted.   She  considered  the
    issue carefully.  She gave good reasons for refusing  the  adjournment.
    In relation to the Article 8 point she considered that if we can say so
    in a very careful and praiseworthy manner.  We are especially impressed
    by the fact that the business partner had made a  statement  which  was
    before her, albeit that it was unsigned.  His  evidence  was  therefore
    available.  He could have appeared at the  hearing  as  he  could  have
    appeared today and he could have given evidence before the  judge.   In
    any event we cannot see that his case would have  greatly  strengthened
    the  appellant's  case.   The  issue  turned  on  whether  or  not  the
    appellants met the points-based system.  The first appellant fell short
    not just in one respect but in as we have said a number of  aspects  of
    the requirements of the Rules.  The Article 8  point  as  we  said  was
    carefully addressed.  We cannot see that the evidence about the  future
    prospects of  the  business  would  on  the  whole  have  been  greatly
    different given that it would be speculation as to the future prospects
    of this business.  We cannot see that  if  the  cases  had  been  heard
    together the  prospects  of  the  business  would  have  been  anything
    clearer.

11. On this basis we dismiss the appeal.
