For the Appellant:     Mr S Bryce, counsel, instructed by Morton Fraser
For the Respondent:    Mr M Mathews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


   1. The appellant appeals a decision of a First-tier  Tribunal  judge  who
      dismissed an appeal against a decision of the Secretary of State dated
      27th February 2014 refusing to vary his leave to remain and to  remove
      him in accordance with s47  Immigration  Asylum  and  Nationality  Act
      2006.






        Background

   2. The appellant is a Turkish National. He and his British  Citizen  wife
      married on 23rd December 2003. They lived  together  in  Turkey  since
      their marriage where their first child was born on 4th May 2007; he is
      a  dual  British/Turkish  citizen.  The  appellant's  wife  (and   the
      appellant) returned to the UK on various occasions to visit family and
      to provide  support  to  other  family  members  during  the  spouse's
      father's periods of illness and/or hospitalisation.  In  October  2012
      the family entered the UK; the appellant left prior to expiry  of  his
      visit visa (mid March 2013) but his wife and the oldest child remained
      in the UK. She had decided that because of her father's  deteriorating
      health and the health problems of one of her sister's  and  a  nephew,
      she could not return to Turkey but that she would remain in the UK for
      the foreseeable future. The child  was  registered  in  and  commenced
      school in the UK. She and the  child  went  to  Turkey  to  visit  the
      appellant in June 2013 and returned a  few  weeks  later  because  her
      nephew was seriously ill.


   3. The appellant then returned to the UK, again as a visitor, with  valid
      entry clearance on 14th August 2013. 6 days prior  to  expiry  of  the
      visit  visa  he  made  an  application  for  leave  to  remain  on   a
      discretionary basis.

        Error of law

   4. Permission to appeal had  been  granted  on  the  basis  that  it  was
      arguable that the First-tier Tribunal had failed to give  any  or  any
      adequate reasons for finding that  the  appellant  did  not  meet  the
      requirements of the Immigration Rules, in  particular  that  paragraph
      EX.1 applied to the appellant and he  met  those  requirements.  Other
      grounds were  argued  and  it  does  not  appear  from  the  grant  of
      permission that the judge considered those other than  to  state  that
      there was no merit in the argument that the judge  should  have  given
      reasons for not accepting the filing of two  unreported  and  redacted
      determinations.


   5. The respondent had filed a Rule 24 response and the appellant  a  Rule
      25 reply. Although the latter was out  of  time  Mr  Mathews  did  not
      object and I admitted it. Nor did Mr Mathews object to  the  amendment
      to the grounds seeking permission to appeal.

   6. The grounds upon which I am to determine  this  appeal  are  thus,  in
      essence, twofold:

   a) That the judge erred in law in failing  to  provide  reasons  for  his
      finding that R-LTRP.1.1(d) with EX.1(a) did not apply; that EX.1  does
      apply and the appellant meets those criteria thus succeeding under the
      Rules.
   b) That the appeal falls to be allowed under Article 8.


      The Immigration Rules and EX.1


   7. The application by this appellant for leave to remain as a spouse  was
      governed by R-LTRP of Appendix FM. This provides for two routes  to  a
      grant of leave to remain as the spouse of British Citizen.  The  first
      requires  that  the  appellant  satisfy   all   of   the   eligibility
      requirements including financial and language. It  was  accepted  that
      the appellant does not satisfy the financial requirements and, at  the
      date of decision he did not meet the language certificate requirements
      although he now does. Although he did not give oral  evidence  it  was
      very apparent, from his ability to follow the  proceedings,  that  his
      standard of English was very high. The second route requires paragraph
      E-LTRP. 2.1 (a) to be construed so as to be subject to paragraph  EX.1
      and that therefore, because paragraph EX.1(a) applied,  the  appellant
      met the requisite criteria in the Immigration Rules.


   8. The rules in so far as relevant to this appeal are as follows:



        "Section R-LTRP: Requirements for limited  leave  to  remain  as  a
        partner
        R-LTRP.1.1. The requirements to be met for limited leave to  remain
        as a partner are-


        (a) the applicant and their partner must be in the UK;


        (b) the applicant must have made a valid application for limited or
        indefinite leave to                      remain as a  partner;  and
        either


        (c) (i) the applicant must not fall for refusal  under  Section  S-
        LTR: Suitability leave to remain; and
              (ii) the applicant meets all of the requirements of Section E-
         LTRP:
        Eligibility for leave to remain as a partner; or


        (d) (i) the applicant must not fall for refusal  under  Section  S-
        LTR: Suitability leave to remain; and
              (ii) the applicant meets the  requirements  of  paragraphs  E-
         LTRP.1.2-1.12. and E-LTRP.2.1.; and
              (iii) paragraph EX.1 applies.


        Relationship requirements
        E-LTRP.1.2. The applicant's partner must be-


        (a) a British Citizen in the UK;


        (b) present and settled in the UK; or


        (c) in the UK with refugee leave or as a person  with  humanitarian
        protection.


        E-LTRP.1.3. The applicant must be aged 18 or over at  the  date  of
        application.


        E-LTRP.1.4. The partner must be aged 18 or  over  at  the  date  of
        application.


        E-LTRP.1.5. The applicant and their partner must not be within  the
        prohibited degree of relationship.


        E-LTRP.1.6. The applicant  and  their  partner  must  have  met  in
        person.


        E-LTRP.1.7.  The  relationship  between  the  applicant  and  their
        partner must be genuine and subsisting.


        E-LTRP.1.8. If the applicant and partner are married or in a  civil
        partnership it must be a valid marriage or  civil  partnership,  as
        specified.


        E-LTRP.1.9. Any previous relationship of  the  applicant  or  their
        partner  must  have  broken  down  permanently,  unless  it  is   a
        relationship which falls within paragraph 278(i) of these Rules.


        E-LTRP.1.10. The applicant and their partner must  intend  to  live
        together permanently in the UK and, in any application for  further
        leave to remain as a partner (except where the applicant is in  the
        UK as a fianc�(e) or proposed civil partner) and in any application
        for indefinite leave to remain as a  partner,  the  applicant  must
        provide evidence that, since  entry  clearance  as  a  partner  was
        granted under paragraph  D-ECP1.1.  or  since  the  last  grant  of
        limited leave to remain as  a  partner,  the  applicant  and  their
        partner have lived together in the UK  or  there  is  good  reason,
        consistent with a continuing intention to live together permanently
        in the UK, for any period in which they have not done so.


        E-LTRP.1.11. If the  applicant  is  in  the  UK  with  leave  as  a
        fianc�(e) or proposed civil  partner  and  the  marriage  or  civil
        partnership did not take place during that period of  leave,  there
        must be good reason why and evidence that it will take place within
        the next 6 months.


        E-LTRP.1.12. The applicant's  partner  cannot  be  the  applicant's
        fianc�(e) or proposed  civil  partner,  unless  the  applicant  was
        granted entry clearance as  that  person's  fianc�(e)  or  proposed
        civil partner.


        Immigration status requirements


        E-LTRP.2.1. The applicant must not be in the UK-


        (a) as a visitor;


        (b) with valid leave granted for a period  of  6  months  or  less,
        unless that leave is as a fianc�(e) or proposed civil  partner,  or
        was  granted  pending  the  outcome  of  family  court  or  divorce
        proceedings; or


        (c) on temporary admission or temporary release  (unless  paragraph
        EX.1 applies).

        E-LTRP.2.2. The applicant must not  be  in  the  UK  in  breach  of
        immigration laws (disregarding any  period  of  overstaying  for  a
        period of 28 days or less), unless paragraph EX.1 applies.


        Section D-LTRP: Decision on application for limited leave to remain
        as a partner


        D-LTRP.1.1. If the applicant meets the requirements in paragraph R-
        LTRP.1.1.(a) to (c) for limited leave to remain as  a  partner  the
        applicant will be granted limited leave to remain for a period  not
        exceeding 30 months, and subject to a condition of no  recourse  to
        public funds, and they will be eligible  to  apply  for  settlement
        after a continuous period of at least 60 months with such leave  or
        in the UK with entry clearance as  a  partner  under  paragraph  D-
        ECP1.1. (excluding in all cases any period of  entry  clearance  or
        limited leave as a fiance(e) or proposed  civil  partner);  or,  if
        paragraph E-LTRP.1.11.  applies,  the  applicant  will  be  granted
        limited leave for a period not exceeding 6 months and subject to  a
        condition of no recourse to  public  funds  and  a  prohibition  on
        employment.


        D-LTRP.1.2. If the applicant meets the requirements in paragraph R-
        LTRP.1.1.(a), (b) and (d) for limited leave to remain as a  partner
        they will be granted leave to remain for a period not exceeding  30
        months and subject to a condition of no recourse  to  public  funds
        unless  the  Secretary  of  State  deems  such   recourse   to   be
        appropriate, and they will be  eligible  to  apply  for  settlement
        after a continuous period of at least 120 months with  such  leave,
        with limited leave as a partner under paragraph D-LTRP.1.1., or  in
        the UK with entry clearance as a partner under paragraph  D-ECP1.1.
        (excluding in all cases any period of entry  clearance  or  limited
        leave as a fianc�(e) or proposed civil partner), or, if paragraph E-
        LTRP.1.11. applies, the applicant will be granted limited leave for
        a period not exceeding 6 months and subject to a  condition  of  no
        recourse to public funds and a prohibition on employment.


        D-LTRP.1.3. If the applicant does not  meet  the  requirements  for
        limited leave to remain  as  a  partner  the  application  will  be
        refused.


        Section EX: Exception


        EX.1 This paragraph applies if
         (a) (i) the applicant has a genuine and subsisting parental
    relationship with a child who-

                  (aa) is under the age of 18 years, or was under the age of
                  18 years when the applicant was first granted leave on the
                  basis that this paragraph applied;?

                  (bb) is in the UK;

                  (cc) is a British Citizen or has lived in the UK
             continuously for at least the 7     years immediately
             preceding the date of application ;and

               (ii) it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave
    the UK; or

        (b) the applicant has a genuine and subsisting relationship with  a
        partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen, settled  in  the
        UK or in the UK with refugee leave or humanitarian protection,  and
        there are insurmountable obstacles to family life with that partner
        continuing outside the UK."


   9. Mr Bryce submitted that a failure to read EX.1 as applying to those in
      the country as visitors, privileges those who are overstayers or  have
      never had lawful leave to be in the country over those  who  have.  He
      submitted that paragraph E-LTRP.2.2  has  not  been  broken  into  sub
      paragraphs and EX.1 applies to the whole of that paragraph; had  there
      been an intention to distinguish E-LTRP.2.1 from E-LTRP.2.2 this would
      have been accomplished by unambiguous words inserted at the  beginning
      of the paragraph. He called in aid the drafting history  and  referred
      to the guidance issued and to the most recent Rule changes pursuant to
      the Immigration Act 2014. Had there been  no  ambiguity,  he  submits,
      there would have been no need for such clarification.

  10. Mr Mathews submits that there is no ambiguity; that there has  been  a
      long history prohibiting "switching" and the  Rules  merely  reiterate
      that. He submitted that it was clear that the words "unless  paragraph
      EX.1 applies" were specific to E-LTRP.2.1 (c) and not to (a).

  11. This issue is not one that was considered in Sabir (Appendix FM - EX.1
      not free standing) [2014] UKUT 63 (IAC) the italicized words of  which
      are:
         It is plain from the architecture of the Rules as regards partners
        that EX.1 is "parasitic" on the relevant Rule  within  Appendix  FM
        that otherwise grants leave to remain. If EX.1 was intended to be a
        free- standing element some mechanism of identification would  have
        been used. The structure of the Rules as presently drafted requires
        it to be a component part of the leave granting Rule. This  is  now
        made plain by the respondent's guidance dated October 2013.
        Although the appeal in Sabir related to a partner who  had  entered
        the UK as a visitor it was not submitted  in  that  case  that  the
        words in question applied  to  (a)  and  the  issue  was  thus  not
        canvassed.


  12. The Secretary of State is entitled to draft and publish Rules  as  she
      wishes. The history of the Rules has been an increasing  reduction  in
      the categories that enable switching. There has been no switching from
      short-term categories to those that require a more in  depth  analysis
      of an applicant's finances and status for a number of  years.  One  of
      the characteristics of entry as a visitor is that the  applicant  must
      intend to leave the UK on completion  of  the  visit  and,  given  the
      relatively short period of time that a person spends in the  UK  there
      is little need for a person to meet the more stringent requirements of
      maintenance as required in categories leading to  settlement  or  more
      long term stay. Obviously this leads to some anomalies - if  a  person
      has overstayed by a very short period of time or a long period of time
      and makes an application they will be privileged in that they can take
      the benefit of EX.1. But those  anomalies  are  anomalies  that  exist
      because of the drafting;  they  do  not  render  the  drafting  itself
      ambiguous or unclear.


  13. The purpose of parentheses is to enclose  information  that  clarifies
      the subject matter or as an aside. Paragraph 350 of HC 760 amends  the
      previous version of the Rules. It plainly amends  E-LTRP.2.1.(c).  The
      words in parentheses remain as words following (c). Had there been any
      intention to amend (a) or (b) or for those words  to  be  utilised  to
      clarify or enclose information relevant to the subject matter  of  (a)
      or (b) then the words would have to be added to be seen to be relevant
      to the subject matter of those sections.

  14. In conclusion therefore although the First-tier Tribunal judge  failed
      to give any reasons for finding  that  EX.1  did  not  apply  to  this
      appellant, and that is an error of law, the finding itself is  correct
      and thus the error is not such that the decision is set  aside  to  be
      remade.

        Article 8

  15. Mr Bryce in a helpful Rule 25 response and in oral submissions  relied
      upon the First-tier Tribunal judge's approach to what  he  termed  the
      'precariousness issue'. He explained this as drawn from Izuazu  [2013]
      UKUT 00045 (IAC) where it was held that an important consideration was
      whether family life was created at a time when  the  persons  involved
      "were aware that the immigration status of one of them was  such  that
      the persistence of that family life within the host state  would  from
      the outset be precarious". He submitted that throughout the period  of
      time  that  the  appellant's  wife  has  been  in  Turkey  (until  the
      introduction of Appendix FM) it was open and foreseeable that  had  an
      application been made by him to come to the UK to settle then it would
      have been granted  without  any  difficulty.  He  submitted  that  the
      appellant and his wife could not have  foreseen  the  introduction  of
      such restrictive criteria as in Appendix FM and nor  could  they  have
      foreseen the deterioration in  his  father  in  law's  health  or  the
      illness of his sister in law or  the  illness  of  his  nephew;  those
      factors were factors that led to the decision to relocate to  the  UK.
      Had those factors occurred earlier the appellant would have  succeeded
      in an application to settle in the UK either immediately  or  after  a
      'probationary period'. The failure of the  judge  to  take  this  into
      account as raising a good arguable case and thus  enabling  all  other
      factors to be  considered  in  addition  in  determining  whether  the
      appellant could succeed under Article 8 was an error of law such  that
      the decision be set aside to be remade.


  16. Mr Bryce acknowledged that without this finding, thus rendering  it  a
      good arguable case as required by MS (India) [2013] CSIH 52  then  the
      other factors including the father in law's medical condition, the age
      of the oldest child, the birth of the  youngest  child,  the  evidence
      with regards to the wife's  siblings  were  insufficient  to  found  a
      successful Article 8 claim.

  17.  The  Immigration  Rules  have  over  the  years  become  increasingly
      restrictive in the requirements to be  fulfilled  by  spouses/partners
      seeking to settle in the UK with  their  British  Citizen  or  settled
      wives. Criteria as to maintenance and accommodation had to be met  and
      those criteria have increased in specificity  and  restriction.  There
      was no evidence before the  First-tier  Tribunal  that  the  appellant
      would have met such criteria at the dates of the relevant  changes  to
      the Immigration Rules and I am not satisfied that it can be said  with
      such categorical assurance that  had  an  application  been  made  the
      appellant would  inevitably  have  been  granted  entry  clearance  to
      settle.  Although it is asserted that the family had every expectation
      of being able to come to the UK should the family circumstances change
      that is not accurate; they had an expectation that the appellant would
      be granted entry clearance if he met the Immigration Rules in force at
      the date of any decision. The Rules have changed on numerous occasions
      over the period of time that the family has been outside  the  UK.  It
      cannot conceivably be argued that changes in the Rules  could  not  be
      anticipated to impact upon them in some way or another.

  18. It is trite law that a  decision  is  taken  in  accordance  with  the
      Immigration  Rules  in  force  at  the  date   of   decision,   absent
      transitional  provisions.  Even  if  it  were  the   case   that   the
      introduction of Rules  has  adversely  affected  the  chances  of  the
      appellant being granted entry clearance  leading  to  settlement  that
      does not and  cannot  result  in  the  utilisation  of  Article  8  to
      circumvent the Immigration Rules. The First-tier  Tribunal  judge  was
      correct in stating that it was foreseeable that the appellant's father
      in law would deteriorate in health over the years to come having had a
      stroke in 2000. Whilst it is correct to say that the appellant and his
      wife could not have foreseen the sister in law's illness  or  that  of
      the nephew, these are matters that can occur in any family.  The  fact
      that such untoward matters occur with the resulting adverse impact  on
      families  cannot  amount  to  a  factor  to,  in  effect,  lead  to  a
      sustainable conclusion that the Rules that  should  be  considered  in
      Article 8 terms are those which are more favourable to  the  appellant
      had those events taken place at an earlier date. Nor does it lead to a
      sustainable argument that because  the  appellant  may  (although  not
      would) have been able to apply successfully for entry clearance at  an
      earlier date whereas today he cannot results in a good  arguable  case
      thus enabling full and  detailed  consideration  of  the  claim  under
      Article 8.

  19. The consideration of whether there is a good arguable case in terms of
      MS (India) requires  consideration  of  reasons  put  forward  by  the
      appellant that the circumstances are such that "refusal  would  result
      in unjustifiably harsh  consequences  for  the  individual  such  that
      refusal of the application would not be  proportionate"  ([28]  of  MS
      (India)  quoting  from  the   Secretary   of   States   guidance)   be
      disproportionate.) MS (India) goes on to conclude ([28]) that

        "in considering whether such circumstances have  been  demonstrated
        by an applicant, the criterion that should be used  is  that  of  a
        "good arguable case",...  The decision  maker  should  examine  the
        circumstances put forward by the applicant  and  determine  whether
        they disclose a good arguable case that the rules would produce  an
        unfair or disproportionate result such that the applicant's Article
        8 rights would be infringed. It is only if that test  is  satisfied
        that there is any need to go on  to  consider  the  application  of
        Article 8 in detail."

  20. Mr  Bryce  in  his  Rule  25  response  makes  clear  ([2])  that  the
      predicament the family found themselves in was not as a result of  the
      deterioration  of  the  father  in  law's  health   but   rather   the
      introduction of Appendix FM. Although that is clearly a predicament  I
      do not accept that this is sufficient to find that  there  is  a  good
      arguable case.


  21. I am satisfied that there is no error of law in the treatment  by  the
      First-tier Tribunal of Article 8.

  22. I would also comment that the First-tier  Tribunal  judge  appears  to
      have considered the elements of the appellant's claim to remain in the
      UK under Article 8 in any event. Although  some  of  the  comments  he
      makes as to the cost and availability of care may  be  speculative  he
      notes that there was no evidence that the father in law would have  to
      move into a care home if the appellant's wife were to  leave  the  UK,
      that she was in any event working and it was  the  appellant  who  was
      visiting him and that she was not in  receipt  of  carer's  allowance.
      Although there were submissions that she would at some  stage  in  the
      future be likely to be able to avail herself of that and that at  that
      time the appellant would be eligible for entry clearance as  a  spouse
      that was not the issue to be determined by the judge at this  hearing.
      The judge considered the sister and nephew's health  problems  and  he
      considered the separation of the child from his father  and  that  the
      child had been in Turkey, a country of which he is a citizen, for most
      of his life.

  23. Although the decision was not one that all judges would have  come  to
      if they had considered the appeal as a "full blown Article 8  appeal",
      the decision reached was one to which the judge was entitled to  reach
      on the evidence before him.

  24. The introduction of s117 Immigration Act 2014  does  now,  of  course,
      change the landscape in terms of matters that are  to  be  taken  into
      account and the weight to be placed upon particular circumstances. The
      Secretary  of  State  may  consider  whether  this  impacts  on   this
      appellant.



          Conclusions:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision is  set
    aside to be remade.

     I do not set aside the decision


    Anonymity


    The First-tier Tribunal made an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of  the
    Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.


    No representations having been made in relation to the  continuance  or
    otherwise of the order I continue that order (pursuant to  rule  14  of
    the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).
