                       (ANONYMITY DIRECTION not made)
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The respondent, Brett Zane Rice, was born on 5 September 1986 and is  a
    male citizen of South Africa.  I shall hereafter refer to the appellant
    as the respondent and to the  respondent  as  the  appellant  (as  they
    appeared respectively before the First-tier Tribunal).   The  appellant
    applied for further leave to remain in the United Kingdom on the  basis
    of his family life in this country.   His  application  was  considered
    under Appendix FM and paragraph 276ADE  of  HC  395  (as  amended)  but
    refused by the respondent  in  a  decision  dated  15  May  2014.   The
    appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Mensah) which,  in
    a decision promulgated on 9 December 2014, allowed the appeal on  human
    rights grounds (Article 8 ECHR).  The Secretary of State  now  appeals,
    with permission, to the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The appeal before the First-tier Tribunal turned upon the income of the
    appellant.  The appellant had entered the United Kingdom on 14 December
    2012 so failed to meet the residence requirements of paragraph  276ADE.
    The appellant had an income which the parties agreed fell short of  the
    financial  minimum  threshold  required  by  the   Immigration   Rules.
    However, the judge found that the appellant's tips from his  employment
    (which amounted to ï¿½27,661.15 from 26 September 2013 - 10  April  2014)
    should be  added  to  his  salary  and,  in  consequence,  though  that
    additional  income  had  not  been  evidenced  as  required  under  the
    Immigration  Rules,  the  public  interest  requiring  the  appellant's
    removal was diminished  to  such  an  extent  that  it  was  no  longer
    proportionate for the appellant to be removed and his appeal should, in
    consequence, be allowed under Article 8 ECHR.

 3. The grounds of appeal challenge those findings.   They  do  so  on  the
    basis that the principles in Patel [2013] UKSC 72 (that a  "near  miss"
    was to no  avail)  and  also  Nagre  [2013]  EWHC  720  indicated  that
    requiring the appellant and his partner to  live  abroad  in  order  to
    continue their family life was not an unjustifiably  harsh  consequence
    of the immigration decision under appeal.

 4. The judge found that there were exceptional circumstances on the  facts
    of this particular case.  The very ground upon the Secretary  of  State
    attacks the judge's reasoning (namely, that "tips by their very  nature
    were prone to fluctuate and could not be guaranteed and therefore could
    not be considered as income for the purposes of Appendix  FM")  is  the
    same basis upon which the judge allowed the  appeal.   Unusually  in  a
    case of this sort, the judge found that the tips were  not  subject  to
    significant fluctuation;  indeed,  she  recorded  that  the  Presenting
    Officer had "very fairly pointed out that HMRC  had  been  sufficiently
    satisfied the tips were predicable income that they intended to  assess
    the tips for the purposes of the appellant's  tax  code  for  the  next
    financial year." [9].

 5. It was the very predictability of the tip income which led the judge to
    find the case  to  be  exceptional.   The  grounds  of  appeal  of  the
    Secretary of State fail to acknowledge that fact.  It was  the  judge's
    finding that the tips did make this a "near miss"  case  but  rather  a
    "hit" case (in which the appellant could show that he  met  the  income
    requirement) albeit one which could not succeed because the evidence of
    the actual income of the  appellant  could  not  be  evidenced  in  the
    required way under the Rules.  The judge clearly  considered  that,  if
    HMRC was prepared to take the tip income into account in assessing  the
    appellant's future  income,  then  she  should  do  so  in  making  her
    proportionality assessment.  I consider that that was  a  decision  for
    the judge herself to make; another judge might have reached a different
    outcome, but that is not the point.  On the particular  facts  of  this
    case (I stress that there is no general principle in  operation  here),
    it was open to Judge Mensah to find that the predictability of the  tip
    income rendered the facts of this appellant exceptional.  In  balancing
    the interference with the appellant's family life which would be caused
    by his removal against the public interest concerned with that removal,
    it was open to the judge to find that the public interest  was  reduced
    because the appellant would earn not just sufficient income to  prevent
    him needing to seek access to public funds, but an income in excess  of
    the minimum required under the Immigration Rules.  The  Upper  Tribunal
    should hesitate before interring with the judgment  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal which has been supported by clear and  cogent  reasoning.   In
    this particular instance and for the reasons given above, I find that I
    should  not  interfere  with  the   First-tier   Tribunal's   decision.
    Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
