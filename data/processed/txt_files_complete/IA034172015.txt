                                                                    Claimant

Representation:

For the claimant: Mr P Bonavero, instructed by Gross & Co
For the respondent:    Mr P Nath, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Monaghan promulgated  13.8.15,  allowing  the
    claimant's appeal against the decision of the secretary of State, dated
    7.1.15, to refuse his application made on 10.10.14 for a permanent  EEA
    Residence Card as the family  member  of  an  EEA  national  exercising
    Treaty rights in the United Kingdom pursuant to the  Immigration  (EEA)
    Regulations 2006, as amended.  The Judge heard the appeal on 31.7.15.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Nicholson granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    31.12.15.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 1.3.16 as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. For the reasons set out below, I found no material error of law in  the
    making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal sufficient to require
    the decision of Judge Monaghan to be set  aside.  Having  announced  my
    decision at the hearing, I reserved my reasons, which I now give.

 5. The relevant background can  be  summarised  briefly  as  follows.  The
    claimant, a citizen  of  South  Africa,  is  the  husband  of  Karolina
    Grantham, a German national.  They  live  in  the  UK  with  their  two
    children, born in South Africa, but of German nationality. Mr  Grantham
    entered the UK in 2008 and made application for  a  residence  card  as
    confirmation of a right to reside in the UK as the family member of  an
    EEA national exercising Treaty rights in the UK, on the  basis  of  her
    self-sufficiency and his employment with a  bank  in  the  UK.  He  was
    granted a residence card, which expired on 13.10.14. Shortly  prior  to
    that date, he made the application for a permanent  residence  card  on
    the basis of a period of 5 years'  continuous  residence,  pursuant  to
    regulation 15(1)(b), the refusal of which was the subject of the appeal
    to the First-tier Tribunal.

 6.  The  reasons  for  refusal  letter,  dated  7.1.15,  noted  that   the
    application relied on the employment and self-sufficiency  of  the  EEA
    sponsoring wife. The Secretary of State considered  that  as  the  only
    income going into the submitted joint bank  statements  came  from  the
    claimant's employment with Investec Bank, the sponsor  could  not  meet
    the  self-sufficient  requirement,  stating,  "In  order  to  be  self-
    sufficient an EEA national cannot rely on income generated  from  their
    partner, whose ability to work is dependant upon them exercising Treaty
    rights. The letter relied on AG & Others (Germany) [2007]  UKAIT  00075
    (IAC). Thus the Secretary of State concluded that the sponsor  was  not
    self-sufficient in the period between  7.9.08  and  5.11.12,  at  which
    point she  became  employed  and  was  able  to  qualify  as  a  worker
    exercising Treaty Rights.

 7. At the First-tier Tribunal appeal hearing (at which  the  Secretary  of
    State was not represented)  the  judge's  attention  was  drawn  by  Mr
    Bonavero,  acting  then  and  today  on  behalf  of  the  claimant,  to
    subsequence case authority before the ECJ, including Alopha v  Ministre
    du Travail de l'Emploie et de l'Immigration (Citizenship of the  Union)
    Case C-86/12, and Kuldip Singh and others v Minister  for  Justice  and
    Equality Case C-218/15. The first, which the judge  distinguished  from
    the circumstances of this  claimant,  was  to  the  effect  that  under
    Directive 2004/38 it is sufficient that such resources are available to
    the Union citizen and lays no requirement whatsoever as to their origin
    and could be provided by a national of a non-member state. However, the
    judge was persuaded by the judgement of  the  court  in  Kuldip  Singh,
    which was asked whether the requirement  of  self-sufficiency  must  be
    interpreted as meaning that a Union citizen  has  sufficient  resources
    for himself and his family members even where those resources derive in
    part from those of the spouse who  is  a  third-country  national.  The
    answer of the court at �75 of the decision, was that to  interpret  the
    requirement as meaning that the person claiming  self-sufficiency  must
    have such resources himself, without being able to use for that purpose
    the  resources  of  an  accompanying  family  member,  would   add   "a
    requirement to the origin of the resources which, not  being  necessary
    for the attainment of the objective pursued, namely the  protection  of
    the  public  finances  of  the  Member  States,  would   constitute   a
    disproportionate interference with  the  exercise  of  the  fundamental
    right of freedom of movement and residence  guaranteed  by  Article  21
    TFEU."

 8. At �76 the Court continued, "It follows that the fact that some part of
    the resources available to the Union  citizen  derives  from  resources
    obtained by the  spouse  who  is  a  third-country  national  from  his
    activity in the host Member  State  does  not  preclude  the  condition
    concerning the sufficiency of resources in Article 7(1)(b) of Directive
    2004/38 from being regarded as satisfied."

 9. Mr Tufan sought to distinguish the present case from those  authorities
    by suggesting that whilst a part of the resources  can  come  from  the
    third-country spouse, they cannot be the sole source of the  resources,
    as the EEA national spouse has to be exercising Treaty rights in the UK
    on her own account. However, as I read the decision in Kuldip Singh, no
    such interpretation is possible. Neither the Directive nor the decision
    makes such a distinction. The reference to resources deriving  in  part
    arose from the particular circumstances of that case and  the  question
    asked. The Court was not laying down a requirement that only a part  of
    those resources could come from the third-country national spouse.

10. Neither do I accept the argument in  the  grounds  of  application  for
    permission to appeal that Regulation 4(4) supports  the  interpretation
    contended for by the Secretary of State when defining a self-sufficient
    person the regulation states, "the resources of  the  person  concerned
    and, where applicable, any  family  members,  are  to  be  regarded  as
    sufficient." That does not import  a  requirement  that  the  resources
    cannot be entirely those of the third-country citizen  spouse.  As  the
    objective pursued is to protect  the  public  finances  of  the  Member
    State, a moment's thought would lead to  the  conclusion  that  such  a
    requirement cannot be proportionate, since if between  them  they  have
    sufficient resources so as not be a burden on the  financial  resources
    of the host Member State, there will be no such burden and thus no need
    for such a condition. Further, to import a requirement that  only  part
    of the resources may come from the third-country national  spouse  begs
    the questions of what proportion their respective parts must be?  Would
    �1 income  of  the  sponsoring  EEA  national  spouse  be  enough?  The
    proposition is fraught  with  difficulties  not  provided  for  in  any
    regulation or guidance and flies in the face of common sense.

11. In the circumstances, I  am  entirely  satisfied  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge correctly applied the law to the facts of the  case  and
    reached the reasoned conclusion that the claimant is  entitled  to  the
    permanent residence card sought.

Conclusions:

12. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains allowed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.




Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make a whole fee award.

Reasons: The appeal was correctly allowed at  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and
the appeal of the  Secretary  of  State  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  has  been
dismissed.
