                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

       This is an appeal, by the , against the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Roxane Eban), sitting at Hatton Cross on 17  April,  to
    a family reunion appeal by the dependent wife, born 24  December  1982,
    and son, born 20 June 2012, of the sponsor. They are citizens of India,
    but he is now a British citizen.

 2. The date of the decision under  appeal  was  11  March  2013,  and  the
    applications had been made on 12 December 2012; so the judge needed  to
    consider the relevant provisions of the 'new  Rules',  including  those
    set out in appendix FM-SE. She accepted his evidence that he  was  paid
    in cash; but she still needed to consider the requirements  of  section
    A1.2. The relevant ones for present purposes appear on the  next  page,
    leaving out the details; paragraph 9 refers to income from shares in  a
    limited company, not relevant to the present case:

       In respect of salaried employment in the UK (except where paragraph 9
       applies), all of the following evidence must be provided:

       (a) Payslips covering:

       (i) a period of 6 months prior to the date of application ...; or

       (ii) ...

       (b) A  letter  from  the  employer(s)  who  issued  the  payslips  at
       paragraph 2(a) confirming:

       (i) the person's employment and gross annual salary;

       (ii) the length of their employment;

       (iii) the period over which they have been or were paid the level  of
       salary relied upon in the application; and

       (iv) the  type  of  employment  (permanent,  fixed-term  contract  or
       agency).

       (c) Personal bank statements corresponding to the same  period(s)  as
       the payslips at paragraph 2(a), showing that the salary has been paid
       into an account in the name of the person  or  in  the  name  of  the
       person and their partner jointly.

 3. The judge did not consider these requirements at all,  though  she  was
    not helped by the terms of the refusal notice, which took  a  different
    point, under paragraph E-ECP 3.3, as to whether bank  statements  which
    did not show any credits as salary could be  taken  into  account.  Mrs
    Pettersen helpfully accepted my suggestion that it was legitimate under
    the wording of (c) for a person paid in cash to show evidence of  that,
    by way of bank statements which showed he had paid  in  enough  of  his
    salary to meet the financial requirements of the Rules.  These,  upheld
    in MM (Lebanon) & others [2014] EWCA Civ 985, are presently �18,600  by
    way of gross salary for each grown-up, with  a  further  sum  for  each
    child. This would have been covered by the �22,740 shown in the  letter
    from the appellant's employer before the judge.

 4. The judge however simply dealt with the  consequences  of  her  finding
    about the cash payments in these terms: "... the deposits to  his  bank
    account represent his net salary after payment of his  living  expenses
    including his rent". No further figures or explanations were given, and
    clearly the judge  needed  to  do  more,  before  allowing  the  appeal
    outright, as she did. If her failure to do so made any real  difference
    to the result, then it was a material error of law, which required  the
    decision to be re-made.

 5. Neither the Home Office grounds of appeal nor the grant  of  permission
    referred, as they should have done, to  the  specific  requirements  of
    appendix FM-SE whish were said to be relevant. Both referred simply  to
    "a P60 and an employment contract", neither of which is specified under
    the rests in appendix FM-SE paragraph A1.2 (a), (b) or (c).  Since  the
    sponsor was appearing in person, I took steps, with  the  help  of  Mrs
    Pettersen, to see whether he had in fact been able to satisfy those  on
    the evidence before the judge. Mrs Pettersen was prepared  to  approach
    the figures in the sponsor's favour in a thoroughly pragmatic  way,  as
    will become clear.





 6. The appellant and his former solicitors had  provided

     a) payslips for the relevant period (May  -  October  2012),  in  some
        cases duplicating each other (of which more later), with
     b) a letter from his employer, and
     c) bank statements to support them.

    The fact that his solicitors had sent in items (a) and  (b)  after  the
    date of the decision under appeal did not of course matter in an appeal
    outside the points-based system [PBS].

 7. The question before me was  how  far  the  payments  in  shown  on  the
    sponsor's bank statements  supported  his  case  that  he  was  paid  a
    constant monthly net sum of �1,500, corresponding to the  gross  figure
    in his employer's  letter.  Dealing  with  them  month  by  month,  the
    position is as follows:

    May       There is no problem with this month, except that the payments
              in put down before me by the sponsor to salary (all  but  the
              PayPal credit on the 25th) amount to a total of  �2,729,  far
              above the �1,500 he (and his pay-slips) said he was getting.

    June      Here the relevant amounts paid in amounted  to  �1,422,  near
              enough the �1,500 the sponsor said  he  had  received  to  be
              regarded by Mrs Pettersen as acceptable.

    July      This month  showed  no  more  than  �760,  again  discounting
              PayPal.  That  could  not  match  the  �1,500  shown  on  the
              appellant's pay-slips, nor even the net monthly equivalent of
              the �18,600 gross a year (�1,550 a month) required  just  for
              the sponsor's wife.

    August    The total was �1,660, once again near enough.

    September This was �1,560, to which the same applies.

    October   Again, this was �1,590.

 8. It follows that the only real problem with the sponsor's  evidence  was
    on the month of July; so I asked him to give his  explanation  for  the
    shortfall between his pay-slips and the bank  statement.  It  is  'pay-
    slips', because he had produced two of them. The one for July (month 4)
    at p 13 of his solicitors' bundle before the judge shows  he  was  paid
    �1,500 in cash, while the one at p 19 for the same period has him  paid
    by cheque. The sponsor's explanation for that was that he was  in  fact
    paid in cash throughout the time in question: if a pay-slip had shown a
    cheque  payment,  as  a  number  of  them  did,  then  that   was   the
    responsibility of the company's accountant.

 9. Going on to the shortfall in the amount, the sponsor said he  had  been
    on holiday for part of that month, and had only been paid a fortnight's
    holiday pay. The trouble with that explanation is that it  did  nothing
    to explain why the pay-slips showed him as having been paid �1,500  net
    during the month. I cannot regard the pay-slips, showing as they  do  a
    regular salary of that amount, as  supported  by  the  bank  statements
    produced.

10. Even on the basis that, as the judge accepted,  the  sponsor  had  been
    paid in cash throughout, the purpose  of  the  Rules,  as  set  out  in
    appendix FM-SE, is clearly to require sponsors to  produce  documentary
    evidence capable of verifying that the financial requirements are  met.
    I have considered whether the large surplus in May  might  support  the
    sponsor's claim to have been paid �22,740 gross  over  the  year  as  a
    whole; but, once again, it is incompatible with his own case,  and  his
    own pay-slips, showing a regular net amount of �1,500.

11. The result is that the judge's failure  to  deal  with  the  evidential
    requirements of appendix FM-SE was material  to  the  result,  and  her
    decision must  be  re-made,  dismissing  the  appellants'  appeal.  The
    sponsor referred to article 8,  and  to  his  own  hard  work  in  this
    country, and to the extended separation between him and  his  wife  and
    son, and the poor conditions in India.

12. I am sorry for them, and the sponsor, being kept apart for longer;  but
    there are no such 'exceptional' or 'compelling' features  in  the  case
    (see MF (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ  1192,  and  MM  (Lebanon)  &  others
    [2014] EWCA Civ 985)  as would require free-standing  consideration  of
    article 8, where failure under the Rules has been  the  consequence  of
    unreliable documents being produced. I  do  not  see  why  the  sponsor
    should not apply again to bring in his wife and  son,  so  long  as  he
    discloses  the  present  refusal,  and  presents  reliable   documents,
    complying with whatever the evidential requirements of the Rules may be
    by then.
