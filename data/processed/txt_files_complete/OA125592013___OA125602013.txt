For the Respondents: Mr A Sinfield, Counsel


                            DECISION AND REASONS


Details of the Parties and Proceedings


  1. The first respondent was born on 20th  November  1981  and  the  second
     respondent, born on 8th March 2003, is her son; they are both  citizens
     of the People's Republic of China.  They are referred to  hereafter  as
     the claimants. They applied for entry clearance to the  United  Kingdom
     under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules as the partner and child  of
     the sponsor, Mr Maoming Chi, a person born on  27th  October  1997  and
     living in the United Kingdom. The entry clearance officer (ECO) refused
     the applications on 9th May 2013 for reasons including failure to  show
     that the financial requirements of the Immigration Rules were met. This
     aspect of the decision was upheld  on  review  by  an  entry  clearance
     manager (ECM) on 5th February 2014.   The  claimants  appealed  against
     the refusal before First-tier Tribunal Judge Britton (the Judge)  at  a
     hearing on 20th May 2014 attended by the sponsor.


  2. The Judge allowed the appeals under the Immigration  Rules.  Permission
     was granted, by First-tier Tribunal Judge Frances on 1st July 2014,  to
     the ECO to appeal against the Judge's decision to  the  Upper  Tribunal
     for the following reasons:


         The grounds submit that the Judge failed to give  adequate  reasons
         for  finding  that  the  appellants   satisfied   the   maintenance
         requirements of the Rules.  The Judge accepted that the Sponsor had
         repaid the overpayment of his wages, but there was no evidence from
         his employer that he had done so.


         It  was  accepted  by  the  Sponsor  in  oral  evidence  that   any
         overpayment of wages had been reclaimed from his  salary.    It  is
         arguable that the Judge erred in law in finding  that  the  Sponsor
         had repaid the overpayment.  The grounds are arguable.


  3. The matter accordingly came before me to determine whether  the  making
     of the decision in the First-tier Tribunal involved the  making  of  an
     error on a point of law. Mr  Richards,  for  the  ECO,  relied  on  the
     grounds of appeal which he said are  brief,  to  the  point  and  self-
     explanatory.  He referred to  the  Judge's  account  of  the  sponsor's
     evidence in paragraph 12 of the determination.  The  sponsor  told  the
     Judge  that  the  money  he  received  from   his   employer   was   an
     administrative error; after the revised calculations  he  has  returned
     the amount that was overpaid to him but "there is no evidence that  the
     money has been reclaimed from his salary".


  4. Mr Richards submitted that the Judge erred by then accepting  that  the
     employer made a mistake and  overpaid  the  sponsor  without  giving  a
     reason for this finding. It was  a  simple  matter  for  the  Judge  to
     identify the documents on which he was satisfied that the  requirements
     of the Rules were met, but he failed to do so.  Mr  Richards  submitted
     that the error of law is as set out in the grounds of  appeal  and  the
     decision should be set aside and remade.


  5. In response Mr Sinfield relied on his skeleton argument as follows. The
     sole issue on which permission to appeal  was  granted  is  whether  an
     accepted overpayment of money to the sponsor has been repaid.  However,
     the repayment of the overpayment is irrelevant to the issue of  whether
     the sponsor met the requirements of the Rules.  There is nothing in the
     Rules  or  any  Home  Office  policy  which  makes  any  reference   to
     overpayment of salary.


  6. It was submitted before the Judge, and he accepted,  that  the  sponsor
     earned in excess of the required sum of �22,400; at paragraph 14 of the
     determination the Judge explains  that  he  found  the  sponsor  to  be
     earning in excess of this requirement.  The  requirement  was  for  the
     claimants to show an available sum from employment  or  self-employment
     with evidence in accordance with Appendix FM-SE, namely payslips,  bank
     statements and an employer's letter.  All such documents were  provided
     by the claimants and the requirements of Appendix FM-SE were  not  just
     met but exceeded by the evidence relied upon.


  7. Mr Sinfield submitted that  the  Judge  carefully  considered  all  the
     evidence  provided,  as  detailed  throughout  the  determination,  and
     provided adequate reasoning for finding the  requirements  to  be  met.
     The Judge accepted  that  the  overpayment  explained  the  discrepancy
     between the sources of evidence; the issue of  repayment  is  therefore
     irrelevant. The Judge made a clear finding that the sponsor has a gross
     salary of �1,760 every 4 weeks and therefore a gross annual  income  of
     �22,800. It is not disputed that the required evidence was provided and
     there was accordingly no error of law, or any error was not material.


  8. Finally,  Mr  Sinfield  submitted  that  all  grounds  were  adequately
     considered by the Judge.  Nothing in the Rules states that  the  income
     received must be shown as the same on the items of evidence as required
     under Appendix FM-SE.  The Judge had to satisfy himself that  that  the
     sponsor's earnings were as required by Appendix FM, E-ECP 3.1.  and  he
     had done so after discussing the evidence in detail, as well as  taking
     account of the oral evidence. In conclusion Mr Richards submitted  that
     although the Rules required the provision of evidence  which  has  been
     submitted the documents were challenged and the Judge therefore  needed
     to give  reasons  for  his  acceptance  of  the  evidence;  clarity  is
     required.

  9. Taking account of all  the  submissions,  the  grounds  of  appeal  and
     permission to appeal, I am satisfied, looking at the  determination  of
     the Judge as a whole, that his decision did not involve the making of a
     material error on a point of law.  The Judge took  careful  account  of
     the reasons for refusal set out by the ECO and the detailed  review  of
     the decision undertaken by the ECM in  the  light  of  the  grounds  of
     appeal. The ECM questioned why the discrepancy between the money  shown
     on the payslips and the money paid into the sponsor's account  was  not
     highlighted by the parties at the time of the application; he  was  not
     satisfied with the explanation about overpayment and repayment of money
     for this reason.


 10. The Judge, however, heard oral evidence  from  the  sponsor  which  was
     tested at the hearing before him. That evidence is set out by the Judge
     in  paragraph  12  of  the  determination.  In  paragraph  13  of   the
     determination the Judge properly directed himself about the burden  and
     standard of proof and moved directly to his findings in  the  following
     paragraph by accepting the evidence that the sponsor's employer made  a
     mistake in the payment of his salary which the sponsor repaid.  On  any
     reading of the determination it is evident that the Judge accepted  the
     evidence of the sponsor and placed reliance upon it, as he was entitled
     to do. The ECM did not have the benefit of such evidence before him  to
     support the grounds of appeal.


 11. Having properly directed himself about the burden and standard of proof
     it was in my view a matter for the Judge to decide whether the evidence
     before him met that standard. His decision is not challenged on grounds
     that the documentary evidence did not come  within  that  specified  by
     Appendix FM-SE; it did. In paragraph 14 of his determination the  Judge
     refers to his reliance on documents which were produced after the  date
     of decision because they were foreseeable.  There  is  nothing  in  the
     determination to show that evidence other than that appertaining to the
     circumstances at the time of the respondent's decision has  been  taken
     into account.


 12. The reference to there being  no  evidence  that  the  money  had  been
     reclaimed from the sponsor's salary came from the sponsor himself,  but
     that excluded his own clear evidence to that  effect.  There  may  have
     been a lack of supporting evidence by way of  documents  or  otherwise,
     but there was nonetheless evidence before the Judge directly  from  the
     sponsor. He may not have explicitly said so but  the  judge's  findings
     amount to an acceptance of the sponsor's credibility  by  relying  upon
     his evidence.


 13. The Judge was in my view entitled to  come  to  the  clear  finding  in
     paragraph 14 of his determination that the sponsor  started  employment
     on 23rd June 2012 and had a salary in excess of �22,400. I am satisfied
     that the reasoning of the Judge is not deficient in the  light  of  his
     clarity about the issues before him, as set out in paragraphs 3 - 9  of
     the  determination.  I  find  that  the   Judge   reached   sustainable
     conclusions adequately supported  with  reasons  and  without  material
     error.  The decision does not fall to be set aside and it follows  that
     it therefore stands and this appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.
