Representation
For the Appellants:    Mr M Rana, Rana and Co Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms A Homes, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The appellants are nationals of  Nigeria.  They  are  a  family  unit,
      consisting of the parents - the first and second appellants - who  are
      married to each other, and their three children, born on  16  December
      2005; 25 November 2006 and 21 August 2008. I shall refer to the  first
      appellant as "the appellant."


   2. Their appeals against the decisions of the  respondent  dated  29  May
      2013 refusing to vary their leave to remain in the  UK  and  to  issue
      removal directions against them under s.47 of the Immigration,  Asylum
      and Nationality Act 2006, were dismissed by First-tier Tribunal  Judge
      Symes in a decision promulgated on 10 December 2014.


   3. The appellant was initially granted  leave  to  enter  the  UK  on  13
      September 2006 until the end of  October  2009.  He  was  subsequently
      granted leave to remain until 30 January 2013. His wife and dependants
      arrived on 10 October 2004 with leave until the end of  October  2009,
      and were subsequently granted  leave  in  line  with  the  appellant's
      leave. The grants were pursuant to the student and  student  dependant
      categories under the Rules.


   4. There were further representations made on  30  January  2013  on  the
      appellants' behalf, by Rana and Co Solicitors, for  limited  leave  to
      remain in the UK, which included an asserted fear of return to Nigeria
      on the basis of  the  risk  to  the  appellant's  daughters  of  being
      subjected to female genital mutilation ("FGM") on return there.


   5.  In  the  reasons  for  refusal,  the  respondent   noted   that   the
      representations based on the fear of return to Nigeria was  a  request
      for international protection, 'constituting'  an  asylum  application.
      They were informed that '.....this claim should therefore be  made  in
      person at an Asylum Screening Unit'.


   6. The immigration history of the appellants was set  out  by  the  Judge
      [2]. The appellant entered as a student,  studying  Computer  Studies.
      After his college lost its sponsor licence, he transferred to  another
      college which also lost its licence.  He  subsequently  studied  at  a
      college which was no longer a registered sponsor. The application form
      dated 30 January 2013 recorded that the appellant earned �500 a  month
      net, and received �250 a month from a friend or relative.


   7. The application  was  refused  because  they  did  not  qualify  under
      Appendix FM  of  the  rules.  The  appellant's  wife  was  a  Nigerian
      national. They were partners, living in a family unit, ruling out  the
      partner and parent routes. It was not accepted that, having  lived  in
      Nigeria for over 36 years of his life, he had severed social  cultural
      or family ties there [4].


   8. The evidence before the First-tier Tribunal  as  set  out  in  witness
      statement of the appellant and supporting statements was summarised by
      the Judge. The appellant and his wife came from the  Delta  region  in
      Nigeria. They feared that their two daughters might suffer FGM if they
      returned there. If they failed to take part in initiation  they  would
      face ostracism from  their  kinsmen.  They  could  not  reasonably  be
      expected to live apart from them, given their family attachments.


   9. Return to Nigeria would contravene the best interests of the children.
      Their maternal grandmother was a British citizen, resident in the  UK.
      Her family life would be affected following a separation from her. The
      family would face severe hardship in the event of a return [8].


  10. The judge had regard to a statement from the brother of the appellant,
      Dr Matthew Obi Onyekweli, a British citizen, who stated  that  he  was
      responsible for his accommodation and his education fees (he was  then
      at the South Chelsea College, Brixton), as  well  as  living  expenses
      [9].


  11. There was supporting evidence produced including  a  statement  by  HM
      Government, that FGM was illegal and a terrible form  of  child  abuse
      which should be eradicated. This is set out in  detail  by  the  Judge
      [10].


  12. The appellant asserted when giving oral evidence  that  his  wife  had
      been  circumcised,  although  he  acknowledged  that  no   independent
      evidence of this was produced. Nobody had told  him  of  the  need  to
      obtain evidence. It was wrong to say that no threats had been made  to
      the children: his wife's family had pressurised her for years. As  his
      own father, mother and sister were here,  there  would  be  no  family
      members to protect them against her family's wishes on  a  return.  He
      had not originally planned  to  raise  this  matter  as  part  of  his
      immigration case. It was only as time went on that  he  and  his  wife
      thought hard about their future [11].


  13. His elder daughter was nearly four years old when she came to  the  UK
      but had not been cut as they had not received any threats  of  cutting
      before coming here. He surmised that this  was  perhaps  because  some
      tribes expected the clitoris to be  elevated  before  they  cut  which
      would rule out the procedure for very young children [12].


  14. He had first appreciated the dangers to  his  daughters,  having  come
      here in 2006. He had not thought about it when he  first  married  his
      wife in 2003. He denied the submission that cutting was essentially  a
      matter of parental choice. The pressure came from the family,  and  in
      their  case  had  intensified  over  time  and  eventually  they   had
      threatened to act by force [12].


  15. He still fears that  the  FGM  procedure  being  done  by  unqualified
      people: However it was done, it would be  dangerous.  He  acknowledged
      that there were some parts of Nigeria where  FGM  was  not  practised,
      such as Kogi and Ogun States. There were however  many  parts  of  the
      country which were not safe and where  the  police  would  not  arrest
      perpetrators. He did not accept that the reports collated in the  Home
      Office country evidence were accurate in recording that FGM had become
      less common [13].


  16. In  his  assessment  and  findings,  Judge  Symes  accepted  that  the
      appellant was a credible witness.  He  gave  a  detailed  and  graphic
      evidence of the reality of his fears as to his wife's  family's  plans
      for their children [19]. He accepted the  historical  facts  asserted.
      However, this did not mean that he accepted the  inferences  that  the
      parents drew from those circumstances as to  the  possibilities  of  a
      life for their children safe from the scourge of FGM in Nigeria [19].


  17. The Judge set out the  requirements  under  paragraph  276ADE  of  the
      rules.  The appellant and his wife have lived in Nigeria for  most  of
      their lives. His wife retains family there. It is their concerns as to
      cultural practices of their family that motivate their application  to
      remain here. They have relatives there, including siblings  with  whom
      they remain in touch. The Judge found  that  it  was  not  tenable  to
      contend that they have no real or effective links with Nigeria [21].


  18. He  accepted  that  they  have  established  private  life  here.  The
      appellant stated that his own family were largely based here  although
      his  relationship  with  them  "remains  unparticularised  as  to  the
      frequency and extent of such life." There is nothing to explain why it
      is that their lives are focussed on the United Kingdom.  The  "factual
      matrix" in that respect is "remarkably  slight."  He  has  worked  and
      studied here.  The Judge accepted  that  Article  8  is  engaged.  The
      relevant issue in the appeal was thus one of proportionality [23].


  19. He had regard to the need  to  consider  the  best  interests  of  the
      children under s.55 of the Borders, Citizenship  and  Immigration  Act
      2009 [24]. The children have lived here for much of their  lives.  The
      third appellant from the age of nearly four until she was nearly nine;
      the fourth from the age of nearly three until the age of nearly eight,
      and the fifth appellant from around one year until the age of six.


  20. Judge Symes found that  were  there  to  be  substantial  grounds  for
      thinking that there was a real  risk  of  any  child  facing  the  FGM
      procedure, he would "......have no hesitation in finding their removal
      to infringe their  rights  to  be  free  from  inhuman  and  degrading
      treatment." [25]


  21. However, the issue was whether they did face such a real risk. He  had
      regard to the recent COIS  report:  FGM  takes  place  throughout  the
      country and has cultural importance.


  22. He referred to and set out the  statistics  of  women  who  have  been
      subjected to the process. This was  most  prevalent  in  the  southern
      region, among the Yoruba and Igbo. The age at which  women  and  girls
      were subjected to the practice varied from  the  first  week  of  life
      until after a woman delivered her first  child.  However,  most  women
      were subjected to FGM before their first birthday. The  percentage  of
      women at risk  decreased  with  every  generation.  An  article  dated
      February 2012 asserted that  the  prevalence  of  FGM  in  Nigeria  is
      estimated at 30-60% - [26].


  23. He noted that the Nigerian state had taken some steps  to  reduce  the
      prevalence of the practice. He set out the evidence in that regard  at
      paragraph 27. However, the 'Say No Unite To  End  Violence  To  Women'
      campaign stated in a report in July 2012 that the  practice  is  still
      very rampant in the country. Though some states including Lagos, Osun,
      Ondo, Ogun, Ekiti, Babyelsa, Edo, Cross-River and Rivers have  enacted
      FGM laws, implementation of the laws has been "a huge challenge" [27].


  24. Judge Symes noted  that  from  the  evidence  referred  to  there  was
      widespread prevalence  of  FGM  and  real  problems  in  the  national
      authority's response to that scourge. He concluded that '.....there is
      a real risk of a Nigerian  female  child  facing  FGM  if  her  family
      practises it and is able and willing to force any recalcitrant parents
      to cooperate; and that there will be no effective protection  such  as
      to reduce that risk to a level where there are no substantial grounds'
      - [28].


  25. However, in this case, the children's  parents  have  set  their  face
      against the process. This has the consequence that FGM will take place
      only if their will is overcome by family pressure. He stated  that  no
      evidence had been put forward as to  the  nature  and  extent  of  the
      threats that they have experienced in the past, and nothing  has  been
      said of the potential reach of the wife's family across the  territory
      of what is a very large country [28].


  26. Whilst they may not speak the language  of  some  of  the  territories
      where FGM is not practised, he did  not  accept  that  they  would  be
      unable to relocate to a major urban area such as Lagos where  even  if
      FGM might be practised by families  who  believe  in  it,  the  second
      appellant's family would have no way of finding her  or  coercing  her
      into behaviour against her will. He noted that they had  moved  across
      the world and established  themselves  successfully  in  the  UK  even
      though the appellant's course of studies had not been  smooth.  Whilst
      they would have to start afresh, they are resourceful and would  enjoy
      the benefits of the studies undergone by the appellant even if he  had
      not attained the qualifications to which he aspired [29].


  27. Judge Symes accordingly found that the children faced no real risk  of
      FGM on return to Nigeria [30].  He  accepted  that  the  children  had
      established private lives in the UK. They had been  in  education  for
      several years enjoying the company  of  their  grandmother.  They  are
      relatively young.


  28. He had regard to the s.55 duties in this case and directed himself  in
      accordance with authority. He found that given their ages, even though
      their residence here had been for most if not all of that  portion  of
      their lives that they can remember, it did not  involve  seven  years'
      residence after the age of four, the period at which, as identified in
      Azimi-Moayed and others (decisions affecting children; onward appeals)
      Iran [2013] UKU 197 (IAC) it can be presumed that there are close  and
      meaningful independent links with peers and teachers [31].


  29. He found that the children here could only realistically  be  expected
      to see themselves as part of a family unit with their  parents.  There
      was nothing to suppose that they could  not,  in  the  future,  thrive
      amongst the education facilities  and  social  contacts  available  in
      Nigeria. No evidence had been put before the Tribunal suggesting  that
      they have any specific connections here outside  the  family  unit  on
      account of schooling or social  activities.  No  school  reports  were
      produced. It was  hard  to  imagine  that  they  would  be  materially
      affected by departure from the UK either now  or  in  the  future.  No
      details had been given as to any family life between the children  and
      any  grandparents,  aunts  or  uncles  save  for  an  unparticularised
      reference to a relationship  with  their  grandmother  which  did  not
      describe the nature or frequency of their contact with her [32].


  30. After considering the appeals following the 'principles' identified in
      EV (Phillipines) and others v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 878 at [58-60],  he
      concluded that the best interests of the children, given  the  limited
      evidence of private and family life in the UK, pointed  in  favour  of
      their relocation with their parents abroad [33].


  31. On 12 February 2015, First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Osborne  granted  the
      appellants permission to appeal.   He  stated  that  in  an  otherwise
      careful and well reasoned decision and reasons,  it  was  nevertheless
      arguable that the Judge failed to  take  into  account  s.117  of  the
      Immigration Act 2014 as there is no reference  to  any  part  of  that
      section in the decision and reasons. He referred to s.117A(2) where it
      is provided that in considering  the  public  interest  question,  the
      Court or Tribunal must, in particular, have regard in all cases to the
      considerations  listed  in  s.117B.  As  an  error  of  law  had  been
      identified, all the issues raised were arguable.


  32. The actual grounds accompanying the permission to appeal are  unusual.
      All that is done is to pose certain questions.  Thus, with  regard  to
      relocation, the ground asks whether having regard to the oral evidence
      of the appellant of ostracism  in  the  event  of  his  resistance  to
      subject his daughter to  undergoing  FGM,  is  this  is  a  reasonable
      alternative? - ground (ii) (a) and (b).


  33. The question is also posed in a separate  ground  as  to  whether  the
      respondent and the tribunal acted in accordance with the duties  under
      s.55 of the 2009 Act? Did the Tribunal consider or properly apply  any
      of the policies of the respondent regarding FGM, in particular  having
      regard to the  Female  Genital  Mutilation  Act  2003  and  its  extra
      territorial application?  Would the combined effect  of  s.11  of  the
      Children Act 2004 and s. 55 BCIA 2009 and article 3 ECHR  not  operate
      as to establish that the appellants are being exposed to "inhuman  and
      degrading treatment"?


  34. With regard to Article 8, the question posed was: "In the view of  the
      mandatory provisions of s.117  of  the  2014  Act,  can  the  tribunal
      lawfully and properly determine an Article 8  claim  by  reference  to
      Appendix FM and the Immigration Rules".


  35. Mr Rana, who had not represented the appellants at the hearing  before
      the First-tier Tribunal, raised the issue of  paragraph  117B  of  the
      2014 Act.


  36. It was pointed out by Ms Holmes that s.117B provides that in the  case
      of a person who is not liable to deportation, the public interest does
      not require that person's removal where the person has a  genuine  and
      subsisting parental relationship with  their  'qualifying  child'  and
      that it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave the UK.


  37. That did not apply here  because  of  the  definition  of  "qualifying
      child" in s.117D(1). A qualifying child means a person under  the  age
      of 18 who is a British citizen or has lived in the UK for a continuous
      period of seven years or more.  The requirements could accordingly not
      be satisfied.


  38. In the circumstances, the public interest considerations were properly
      applied in this appeal.


  39. Mr Rana then submitted that the risk of  FGM  had  not  been  properly
      appreciated by the Judge. He referred to paragraphs 26  and  27  where
      the Judge noted that FGM does take place. The Judge had also concluded
      that there was a real risk of a Nigerian female child  facing  FGM  if
      the family practices it.  Mr Rana submitted that  internal  relocation
      could not take place because there are tribes in Nigeria as well as  a
      cultural tradition favouring FGM. The appellants belong to tribes from
      the South and could not relocate.


  40. It was also submitted that the Judge did not  properly  consider  that
      'the girls' would be at risk of being isolated and ostracised  in  the
      future. The appellant's wife had been a victim  of  FGM.  However,  Mr
      Rana accepted that no evidence to that effect had been produced to the
      Tribunal, as acknowledged by the appellant. He told the Tribunal  that
      he had not obtained evidence of this from a doctor as he had not  been
      told [11].


  41. Mr Rana also referred to the Female Genital Mutilation  Act  2003  and
      its extra-territorial application. That Act makes  it  an  offence  to
      assist the practice of FGM. If they are living in a tribal area,  they
      could not resist the undergoing of  FGM  for  a  lengthy  period.   He
      submitted that family life had been referred to, and in particular the
      relationship between the children and the grandmother. There  was,  he
      submitted, 'an emotional dependence that had arisen'.


  42. During the course of his  submissions,  Mr  Rana  contended  that  the
      children have a bond with their grandmother. She is 85 years  old  and
      family life had been established. He accepted that there had  been  no
      reference to the grandmother and  the  asserted  relationship  in  the
      grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.


  43. On behalf of the respondent, Ms Holmes submitted that there  had  been
      no material error of law. The Judge had assessed the evidence relating
      to FGM carefully. This began at  paragraph  25  of  the  determination
      which identified the issue as whether  their  departure  from  the  UK
      would result in their facing a risk of female genital mutilation.  The
      Judge stated that if he thought that there was such a  risk  he  would
      have no hesitation in finding their removal to constitute inhuman  and
      degrading treatment. He set out the evidence from the COIS reports  as
      well as other reports fairly [27-28].


  44. In the result, she submitted that the findings made were open  to  the
      Judge.


Assessment


  45. I have referred to the basis  upon  which  permission  to  appeal  was
      granted. It had been contended that s.117 of the Immigration Act  2014
      had  not  been  properly  complied  with,  and   in   particular   the
      considerations listed in s.117B.


  46. However, as already indicated, the provisions in the 2014 Act were not
      germane or relevant as none  of  the  female  child  appellants  is  a
      'qualifying child' for the purpose of s.117.


  47. I have set out and had regard to the determination of  the  First-tier
      Judge. I  agree  with  the  comments  of  Judge  Osborne  in  granting
      permission that this was a careful and well reasoned decision.


  48. The Judge was alive  to  the  crucial  issue  of  whether  there  were
      substantial grounds for thinking that there was a  real  risk  to  any
      child facing such a procedure


  49. In his assessment, he had  regard  to  their  concerns  regarding  the
      cultural practices of their family, which motivated their applications
      to remain in the UK. The maternal grandparents live in Nigeria.


  50. The Judge has however properly assessed whether they faced a real risk
      of such conduct. He has had regard to  the  recent  COIS  report,  the
      results and conclusions of which are summarised at paragraphs  26  and
      27 of the determination.


  51. He went on to find that there is a real risk  for  a  Nigerian  female
      child facing FGM if her family practises it and is able and willing to
      force any recalcitrant parents to cooperate and that there will be  no
      effective protection to reduce the risk to a level where there are  no
      substantial grounds.


  52. In this case, the Judge found that the  children's  parents  have  set
      their face against the process. This  had  the  consequence  that  FGM
      would only take place if  their  will  would  be  overcome  by  family
      pressure.


  53. He noted that no evidence had been put forward as to  the  nature  and
      extent of the threats experienced in the past. Nothing has  been  said
      of the potential reach of the wife's family across  the  territory  of
      Nigeria. He noted that the children had  not  been  subjected  to  FGM
      prior to coming to the UK, albeit that the appellant's elder  daughter
      was nearly four years old when she came to the UK.


  54. The Judge gave proper reasons as to why he did not  accept  that  they
      would, if necessary, be unable to relocate to a major urban area  such
      as Lagos where, even if FGM might be practised by families who believe
      in it, the second appellant's family would have no way of finding her,
      or of coercing her into such behaviour against her will.


  55. In coming to that conclusion he had regard to the  evidence  that  the
      appellants had moved  across  the  world  and  established  themselves
      successfully in the UK. Even though they might have to  start  afresh,
      they are resourceful and would  enjoy  the  benefits  of  the  studies
      undergone by the appellant.


  56. For all those reasons, the Judge found that they would  face  no  real
      risk of FGM on return to Nigeria.


  57. The Judge has given  proper  reasons  for  such  findings,  which  are
      sustainable and based on the evidence before him as to the risk of FGM
      on return to Nigeria.


  58. With regard to private and family life in the UK, the Judge noted that
      they enjoyed the company of their grandmother. However, he also  noted
      that there had been no evidence presented as to its nature and extent.
      No details had been  provided  as  to  any  family  life  between  the
      children  and  any  grandparents,  aunts  or  uncles,  save   for   an
      'unparticularised' reference to a relationship with their grandmother,
      which did not describe the nature or frequency  of  any  contact  with
      her.


  59. Having accepted that the children have established  private  lives  in
      the UK, he took into account that  they  had  been  in  education  for
      several years. They are relatively young. He had regard to s.55 of the
      2009 Act. He found that at their ages,  even  though  their  residence
      here had been for most if not all of that portion of their lives  that
      they can remember, this did not involve seven years'  residence  after
      the age of four, the period at which, as identified  in  Azimi-Moayed,
      supra, it  can  be  presumed  that  there  are  close  and  meaningful
      independent links with peers and teachers.


  60. Moreover, he considered the "principles" identified by Lewison  LJ  in
      EV (Philippines), supra, to the effect that the assessment of the best
      interests of the children must be made on the basis that the facts are
      as they are in the real world. Neither parent had the right to remain.
      That is the background against  which  the  assessment  is  conducted.
      Lewison LJ could not see that the desirability of  being  educated  at
      public expense in the UK can outweigh the benefit to the  children  of
      remaining with their parents.


  61. In the circumstances, the Judge's conclusion  at  paragraph  33,  that
      given the limited evidence of private and family life  established  in
      the UK, the best interests of the children point in  favour  of  their
      relocation with their parents  abroad,  is  based  on  the  underlying
      evidence and is sustainable.
