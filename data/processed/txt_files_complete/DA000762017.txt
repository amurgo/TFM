Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Bramble, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Nicholson


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a decision of First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Colvin promulgated on 29 November  2017.  We  shall
    refer to the respondent in this appeal  as  the  appellant  as  he  was
    before the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria. He was born in 1963.  He  claims
    to have entered the UK illegally in 1994  but  there  is  apparently  a
    conviction for forgery recorded against him in 1990. During his time in
    the UK he has been married three times, once to a UK citizen and  twice
    to EU nationals. At the present time he is married to a  Dutch  citizen
    living and exercising Treaty rights in the  UK.  They  are  now  living
    apart though apparently on good terms. He also has a child aged  12  by
    another relationship. The child is a British citizen.

 3. On 4 March 2009 the appellant was convicted  of  conspiracy  to  supply
    cocaine, a class A drug. In July 2009 he was sentenced to 8 years and 3
    months imprisonment.  The  sentencing  judge  recommended  that  he  be
    deported saying, "I have no hesitation whatsoever  in  concluding  that
    persons such as you, who are prepared to engage in the supply of  class
    A drugs such as cocaine have no place in this society." A  confiscation
    order as made in the sum of �49,000. With accrued interest the debt now
    stands at over �60,000. In July 2017 an order was made for him  to  pay
    at the rate of �5 per week.

 4. The issues before the First-tier Tribunal can be summarised as follows;
    first whether the appellant had acquired a permanent right of residence
    under regulation 15(1)(b) of the Immigration (European  Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2006  ("the  2006  regulations")  and  if  so  whether  the
    decision could be justified on serious  grounds  of  public  policy  or
    public security (regulation 21(3); secondly whether the appellant could
    succeed on his  asylum  claim;  and  thirdly  whether  the  deportation
    decision was consistent with the appellant's human rights.

 5. Judge Colvin allowed the appeal  under  the  first  of  these  headings
    finding, first that the appellant had a permanent  right  of  residence
    and secondly that the Secretary of State had not demonstrated that  the
    decision could be justified on serious  grounds  of  public  policy  or
    public security. Although not necessary for her decision she went on to
    consider the asylum claim and human rights. She rejected  both  claims.
    The appellant has not challenged these findings. Accordingly  the  only
    issue before us is whether Judge  Colvin  was  entitled  to  allow  the
    appeal under the 2006 regulations.

 6. At paragraph 28 Judge Colvin finds that on the balance of probabilities
    the appellant had acquired permanent residence under regulation 15. She
    records the evidence and submissions  at  paragraphs  26  and  27.  The
    appellant was married to a Dutch national exercising Treaty  rights  on
    25 June 2004. He was imprisoned, according to the reasons letter, on 25
    March 2009. The appellant maintained that he had been living  with  his
    wife for a few months prior to the marriage.  He  submitted  a  utility
    bill in their joint names dated 20 April 2004. The submission was  that
    he had acquired a  right  of  permanent  residence  during  the  period
    January 2004 to January 2009.

 7. Mr. Bramble submitted that the starting point should be the marriage in
    June  2004  as  the  appellant  had  not  applied  for  a  registration
    certificate under regulation 17. The other evidence was insufficient to
    demonstrate  a  genuine  and  subsisting  relationship  prior  to   the
    marriage. Accordingly the appellant had only  demonstrated  4  years  9
    months residence.

 8. Mr Nicholson was unable to advise us where the start point  of  January
    2004 in the appellant's submissions to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  came
    from but we noted that the utility bill of 20 April 2004 is in  fact  a
    British Gas reminder to pay a bill in joint names dated 6  April  2004.
    We assume that  the  payment  was  in  arrears  but  in  any  event  it
    demonstrates that some time before April 2004  the  appellant  and  his
    partner had  the  account  put  in  joint  names.  Accordingly  we  are
    satisfied that Judge Colvin was entitled to conclude that by March 2009
    the  appellant  had  acquired  five  years   permanent   residence   in
    accordance with regulation 15(1)(b).

 9. Mr Bramble submitted that in finding that the Secretary  of  State  had
    failed to establish that the test in  regulation  21(3)  had  been  met
    Judge Colvin had failed to take into account all the competing factors.
    In particular she had failed to note the negative factors in the OAYsys
    report referred to in the reasons letter. These comments  were  to  the
    effect that the appellant had failed to recognise the  problem  he  was
    putting himself into which led  him  into  the  custodial  sentence  he
    faced. It further noted  that  the  appellant  "had  demonstrated  poor
    consequential thinking  in  committing  the  offences"  and  failed  to
    consider the wider consequences of the victims of drug misuse.  He  had
    said that he did not wish to ask any questions about what was going  on
    as he did not want to lose money.. It also noted that he had  completed
    a Drug Awareness and Social  Awareness  course  while  in  custody.  Mr
    Bramble submitted that these comments showed that he had  not  accepted
    the offence that took place and reflected adversely on his attitude  to
    the offence.

10. Judge Colvin correctly records that a deportation order in respect of a
    person with a permanent right of residence under the  2006  regulations
    may only be made on serious grounds of public policy or public security
    (regulation 2(3)). From paragraphs 29 to 34  she  notes  evidence.  She
    commences by recording the appellant was convicted of a serious offence
    and notes the sentencing judge's remarks. She noted that the  appellant
    had not committed any further offences and complied with the  terms  of
    his licence. The OASys  report  assessed  the  likelihood  of  his  re-
    offending/reconviction and his risk of harm as 8%. He was not  suitable
    for the Thinking Skills Programme as  his  risk  was  lower  than  that
    required for the course. The Offender Manager's assessment  in  January
    2016 was that the appellant was at low risk of harm  and  reconviction.
    She considered regulation 21(5)(c)  and  asked  whether  the  appellant
    represents a genuine and sufficiently serious threat affecting  one  of
    the fundamental interests of society. Having addressed the law  on  the
    matter at paragraphs 31 and 32 she  concluded  that  the  Secretary  of
    State has not established that the test in regulation 21(5)(c)  applies
    so as to justify the deportation decision (paragraph 34).

11. Regulation 21(5)(c) is of course one of the factors to  be  taken  into
    account when reaching a decision under regulation 21(3). It is  not  in
    itself the test. But it is clear that in determining that the principle
    embodied in 21(5)(c) had not been met Judge Colvin was  satisfied  that
    deportation would be contrary to regulation 21(3).

12. It is true that Judge Colvin does not refer to the  comments  from  the
    OASys report referred to in the reasons letter. However we do not think
    that there is any error of law  in  failing  to  mention  them  in  the
    section dealing with the assessment. In the  first  place  we  are  not
    satisfied that the sections of the  OASys  report  relied  upon  by  Mr
    Bramble justify the submission that the appellant did  not  accept  the
    offence. We read them as the appellant's  attitude  in  committing  the
    offence and not a reflection of his acceptance of his guilt;  we  noted
    that the appellant pleaded guilty. Secondly as Judge  Colvin  noted  at
    paragraph 32, under reference to the judgement of the Court  of  Appeal
    in Straszewski v SSHD and Kersys v SSHD [2016] 1 WLR 1173 the focus  is
    to look at the future not the past.  The  issue  is  to  be  determined
    solely by reference to the conduct of the offender and  the  likelihood
    of re-offending.

13. We should also record that one of the grounds of appeal  was  that  the
    Judge had found at paragraph 42 that the Secretary of State had yet  to
    consider the best interests of the child, aged 12. The ground  goes  on
    to criticise Judge Colvin's treatment of the evidence  in  relation  to
    the best interests of the child. We do not consider this to be material
    in light of our decision that Judge Colvin  was  entitled  to  conclude
    that the deportation was not justified on  serious  grounds  of  public
    policy or public security.

Notice of Decision

The appeal is dismissed.
