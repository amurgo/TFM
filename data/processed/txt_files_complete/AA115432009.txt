                               JG ( Zimbabwe)
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                 Secretary of State for the Home Department
                                                                  Respondent

                          NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL AND
                   REASONS FOR THE TRIBUNAL GIVING CONSENT

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Zimababwe born 1970. She appealed  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal against a decision of the Secretary of  State  dated
    14 September 2009 refusing her asylum claim and that of her  dependents.
    The First-tier Tribunal dismissed this appeal in a determination dated 2
    November 2009.

 2. By way of a letter to the Upper  Tribunal  dated  23  January  2014  the
    appellant's representatives have requested permission  to  withdraw  the
    appellant's appeal before the Upper Tribunal.

 3. Consent of the Upper Tribunal is required for a party  to  withdraw  its
    case. Having carefully considered the facts and history of  this  appeal
    as a whole, I give consent to the appellant to withdraw her case.

 4. Accordingly with my consent, and pursuant to rule 17(5) of the  Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal)  Rules  2008,  this  appeal  is  recorded  as
    "Withdrawn with the consent of the Upper Tribunal".  This  is  a  Notice
    pursuant to rule 17(5) to inform the parties that the  appellant's  case
    is withdrawn.

 5. The effect of the  appellant's  case  being  withdrawn  from  the  Upper
    Tribunal is that the proceedings before the Upper  Tribunal  are  at  an
    end. There is no appeal before the Upper  Tribunal  and  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's decision shall stand.
