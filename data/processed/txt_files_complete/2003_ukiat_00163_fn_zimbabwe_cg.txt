Appearances
For the appellant:     Miss S Solomon, Counsel instructed by Messrs Asghar
                       & Co, Solicitors
For the respondent:    Ms A Holmes, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    The appellant, a citizen of Zimbabwe, appeals with leave  against  the
      determination of  an  Adjudicator,  Ms  Rebecca  Caswell,  sitting  at
      Bradford, in which she dismissed on asylum and  human  rights  grounds
      the appellant's appeal against the decision of the respondent to  give
      directions for the appellant's removal from the United Kingdom.

2.    The Adjudicator found that the appellant was a member of the MDC,  who
      attended meetings and put up posters.  He had been attacked by ZANU-PF
      youths and also held by the police for two days, during the course  of
      which he was ill-treated.  Along with others, the  appellant  was  the
      subject of attempts  by  ZANU-PF  supporters  to  coerce  people  into
      attending a ZANU-PF meeting in December 2001.  Together  with  others,
      he refused, as a result of which ZANU-PF youths went on the rampage.

3.    On the basis of those findings, it  is  contended  on  behalf  of  the
      appellant that the Adjudicator erred in  finding  that  the  appellant
      would not be at real risk of persecution in  his  home  area.   It  is
      further contended that the Adjudicator was wrong to conclude that,  in
      any event, the appellant could avail himself  of  internal  flight  to
      another part of Zimbabwe.  The reason for this contention is that  the
      appellant would, it is claimed, be at risk of being  detained  at  the
      airport, as someone who has  a  record  of  detention,  and  he  would
      therefore be unable to avail himself of the opportunity of re-locating
      to some other part of Zimbabwe.

4.    The Adjudicator's findings are set out at paragraphs 19 to 29  of  her
      determination.  Those  findings  are,  the  Tribunal  considers,  both
      eminently  fair  and  well  reasoned.   The  Adjudicator  found  that,
      notwithstanding the matters referred to above (which she accepted  had
      occurred), the appellant would not have left his wife and child in the
      house alone, once he left for the second and final time, if  the  risk
      had been as significant as he claimed.

5.    It is submitted on  behalf  of  the  appellant  that  the  Adjudicator
      failed to appreciate that the ZANU-PF supporters  were  interested  in
      the appellant himself, rather than his wife and child, albeit that the
      wife was herself an MDC member.  This submission,  however,  fails  to
      meet  the  point  that  the  Adjudicator,  at  paragraph  22  of   the
      determination, observed that, on his own account,  the  appellant  had
      said that the reason for at least one of the visits by ZANU-PF to  the
      wife at the family home, after he had left, was "that they  wanted  to
      scare her".  In  the  circumstances,  the  Adjudicator  was  perfectly
      entitled to conclude that the appellant's decision to leave his family
      behind showed that, in reality, he faced no real risk  of  persecution
      in his home area.

6.    Likewise, the Adjudicator was entitled at paragraph 24 to  find  that,
      if ZANU-PF had taken the friend known as Japhet, then:

           "this would have marked a substantial increase in the  level  of
           danger to [the appellant] and his family (over  and  above  that
           experienced in December 2001), and I find he  would  have  taken
           steps to remove them as well as himself."

7.    At page 16 of  the  appellant's  bundle,  page  12  of  the  US  State
      Department report on Zimbabwe for 2002,  we  note  that  the  security
      forces

           "searched homes and offices without warrants, and the government
           was  believed  to  monitor  some  private   correspondence   and
           telephones."

      The Human Rights Watch report at page 70 of the bundle observes that:


           "Security forces possess good information  on  MDC  members  and
           their movements.  They  would  sometimes  ask  those  they  were
           beating for the location of particular individuals;  and even if
           they did not get this information, reveal they already knew  the
           answer."

8.    At 6.149 of the October  2003  CIPU  assessment  on  Zimbabwe,  it  is
      stated that:

           "Opposition political activists, particularly those belonging to
           the  MDC,  have  been  targeted  and  attacked   by   government
           supporters and war veterans since the Parliamentary elections in
           June 2000."

      MDC activists are also reported to have been abducted,  especially  in
      rural areas.  The MDC

           "claimed that 227 of  their  activists  had  been  abducted  and
           beaten.  Some abductees were  tortured  and  others  later  were
           found killed.  Members of the security forces also  participated
           in attacks on opposition activists and suspected supporters."

9.    What the Tribunal derives from these and, indeed, the other  objective
      materials on Zimbabwe is that, whilst it is possible for an MDC member
      and supporter who does not  merit  the  description  of  an  activist,
      nevertheless to find himself or herself  in  receipt  of  the  adverse
      attentions of ZANU-PF thugs and/or war veterans, the evidence does not
      show that any member as such runs a real risk  of  harm  that  can  be
      categorised as so serious as to be persecutory or in breach of Article
      3 of the ECHR.

10.   Accordingly, on the basis of the facts found by  the  Adjudicator,  we
      do not find that she could in any sense be said to be plainly wrong in
      her finding that this appellant could return  to  his  family  without
      running a real risk of such persecution or harm.

11.   Even if that were not to be the case, however, the Adjudicator was  in
      our view manifestly entitled to conclude that the appellant could  re-
      locate to another part of Zimbabwe  (as  he  had,  in  fact,  actually
      done), without running a real risk of coming to the adverse  attention
      of ZANU-PF/war veterans.

12.   The grounds of appeal contend that internal flight is,  in  fact,  not
      an option since the appellant is likely to face hostile treatment upon
      return to Zimbabwe.  He will be questioned at the airport and the fact
      of his  previous  detention  will  come  to  light.   The  grounds  in
      particular assert  that  the  Adjudicator   at  paragraph  27  of  her
      determination pointed to no evidence to support her finding that there
      would not "be a record of detention against" the appellant "given that
      he was, on his own account, released after two days without charge".

13.   Miss Soloman submitted that there was no evidence either way  on  this
      specific issued but that, given the overall nature of  the  Zimbabwean
      regime at the present time, the Adjudicator had been wrong  to  assume
      that there was no real risk that such records  existed  and  would  be
      discoverable as regards this particular appellant.

14.   We find that the Adjudicator was entitled  to  say  what  she  did  at
      paragraph 27  of  the  determination.   Whilst  the  evidence  clearly
      indicates that activists  are  capable  of  being  identified  by  the
      security forces and ZANU-PF supporters, within Zimbabwe, it is  simply
      going to far to infer the Zimbabwean authorities have a record-keeping
      system which would make available to staff at the airport  information
      upon those who have merely been detained, without charge.  The  burden
      of proof remains on the appellant.  He has failed to show any evidence
      to support a finding that such a record-keeping system exists  and  is
      operated in Zimbabwe in  the  manner  asserted.   Although  no  failed
      asylum seekers are, at the present time, being  forcibly  returned  by
      the British authorities to Zimbabwe, we are unaware of any evidence to
      show that air travel between the two  countries  has  ceased  or  that
      there  is  otherwise  a  complete  absence  of   Zimbabwean   citizens
      travelling for whatever reason from the United  Kingdom  to  Zimbabwe.
      Were there evidence that returnees are being subjected to the sort  of
      scrutiny alleged in the present case, one would expect evidence of  it
      to be produced.

15.   This appeal is accordingly dismissed.
