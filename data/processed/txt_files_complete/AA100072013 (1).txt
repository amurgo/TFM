                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


     1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a determination
        of First-tier Tribunal Judge Phull, promulgated following a hearing
        at Birmingham on 6th December 2013, in which she allowed the appeal
        on asylum grounds against the direction for Mr Thaci's  removal  to
        Albania that accompanied the refusal of his asylum claim.



Background


     2. Mr Thaci was born on the 7th March 1996. He claims to be  from  the
        North-eastern part of Albania and unable  to  return  to  his  home
        state as a result of a blood feud.


     3. Mr Thaci states that his father was involved in  a  blood  feud  in
        1962 and killed a neighbour.   His  father  was  found  guilty  and
        sentenced to 29 years imprisonment. On release he returned  to  his
        home village, married, and had five children of which Mr  Thaci  is
        the eldest.


     4. It is claimed the family of the person his father  killed  did  not
        forgive his father and  the  deceased's  grandchildren  bullied  Mr
        Thaci at school. He alleges he was told that when he  turns  18  he
        will be killed.


     5. The other family did not want to discuss reconciliation  and  after
        an incident in which there was a fight and the police and ambulance
        were called, a message was sent around the village  that  Mr  Thaci
        will be killed. As a result he remained inside for  two  weeks  and
        eventually left the country with the help of an agent.


     6. The Judge records it was accepted that at the date  of  his  asylum
        claim Mr Thaci was 17.5 years old. Nationality is not disputed. The
        Judge found Mr  Thaci  to  be  credible  [26]  and  that  objective
        material in the form of a letter form Gjinaj Municipality  claiming
        the village elders were aware of his father's imprisonment and  the
        existence of a blood feud was considered and accepted. It was found
        the family of the alleged deceased live in the same village  as  Mr
        Thaci's family and, indeed, next door to them [30].   It  was  also
        found that the family of the deceased will look for Mr  Thaci  when
        he attained the age of 18, that there is a real risk of persecution
        with no protection available from the authorities [34].




Error of law


     7. This is a case in which there is arguable merit in the Secretary of
        States claim.


     8. The current country guidance case is EH (blood  feuds)  Albania  CG
        [2012] UKUT 00348 (IAC) in which the Tribunal held:


              (i)      While there remain a number of active blood feuds  in
   Albania, they                are few and declining.  There  are  a  small
   number of deaths annually                 arising from those feuds and  a
   small number  of  adults  and  children                 living  in  self-
   confinement  for  protection.  Government   programmes                 to
   educate  self-confined  children  exist  but  very   few   children   are
   involved in them;


              (ii)     The  existence  of  a  'modern  blood  feud'  is  not
   established: Kanun               blood feuds have always allowed for  the
   possibility of pre-emptive                killing by a dominant clan;


              (iii)    The Albanian state has taken steps to  improve  state
   protection, but  in                areas  where  Kanun  law  predominates
   (particularly in northern                     Albania) those steps do not
   yet provide sufficiency of protection                  from Kanun-related
   blood-taking if an  active  feud  exists  and  affects                the
   individual claimant. Internal relocation  to  an  area  of  Albania  less
      dependent  on   the   Kanun   may   provide   sufficient   protection,
     depending on  the  reach,  influence,  and  commitment  to  prosecution
     of the feud by the aggressor clan


               (iv)       International   protection   under   the   Refugee
   Convention, Qualification                 Directive or Articles 2  and  3
   ECHR is not available to an appellant                  who is willing and
   intends to commit a  revenge  killing  on  return  to                 his
   country of origin, by reference to that intention


              (v)      Where there is an active feud affecting an individual
   and self-                    confinement is the only option, that  person
   will normally qualify for                 Refugee status


              (vi)     In determining whether an active blood  feud  exists,
   the  fact-finding                  Tribunal  should  consider:  (a)   the
   history  of  the  alleged   feud,                         including   the
   notoriety   of   the   original    killings,    the    numbers    killed,
   and  the  degree  of  commitment  by  the  aggressor  clan   toward   the
   prosecution of the feud;(b) the length of time since the last  death  and
          the relationship of the last person killed  to  the  appellant;(c)
   the                     ability of  members  of  the  aggressor  clan  to
   locate the appellant if                   returned  to  another  part  of
   Albania; and(d) the past and likely future                   attitude  of
   the  police  and   other   authorities   towards   the   feud   and   the
   protection of the family of the person claiming to be at risk,  including
              any past attempts  to  seek  prosecution  of  members  of  the
   aggressor               clan, or to seek  protection  from  the  Albanian
   authorities;


              (vii) In order to establish that there is an active blood feud
   affecting  him                 personally,  an  appellant  must   produce
   satisfactory individual                       evidence of  its  existence
   in relation to him.  In  particular,  the                       appellant
   must  establish:  (a)  his  profile  as  a  potential   target   of   the
   feud identified and which family carried out  the  most  recent  killing;
          and (b) whether the appellant has been, or other  members  of  his
          family have been, or are  currently,  in  self-confinement  within
              Albania;


              (viii)  Attestation  letters  from  Albanian  non-governmental
   organisations                 should  not  in  general  be  regarded   as
   reliable evidence of the                      existence of a feud;


              (ix)      Documents  originating  from  the  Albanian  courts,
   police or                    prosecution service, if genuine, may  assist
   in establishing the                       existence of a  blood  feud  at
   the date of the document relied  upon,                   subject  to  the
   test  of  reliability  set  out   in   A   v   SSHD   (Pakistan)   [2002]
   UKIAT 00439, [2002] Imm A R 318 (Tanveer Ahmed)


              (x) Unless factual,  prompt  and  consistent,  Albanian  press
   reports will                  add  little  or  no  evidential  weight  in
   considering whether a feud exist;


              (xi)     Whether the feud continues and what the  attitude  of
   the aggressor                clan to  its  pursuit  may  be  will  remain
   questions of fact to be                        determined  by  the  fact-
   finding Tribunal.


     9. Although referring to this case the  Judge  failed  to  consider  a
        number of relevant issues upon which findings are required such as:


              a.  The fact Mr Thaci's father is  said  to  have  killed  the
   neighbour in 1962                and to have been imprisoned until  1989,
   yet the alleged aggressor                 clan have waited until Mr Thaci
   was approaching the age of 16                      before activating  the
   feud.


              b.  Why, as the feud allegedly lay  dormant  for  over  twenty
   years, it               shoulder re-activated now.


              c.  The need to give adequate reasons for  the  weight  placed
   upon the                letters provided by Mr Thaci in  support  of  his
   case in light of the                  guidance provided in EH relating to
   such material.


              d.  The existence of an internal flight option


    10. The existence of a blood feud was not accepted by the Secretary  of
        State.


    11. Although the Judge refers to EH I find there is arguable  merit  in
        the assertion by Mr Mills that she failed to apply  the  principles
        arising from that case to the facts of this case properly.  I  find
        the failure to do so and to give adequate reasons for findings made
        casts doubt upon the reliability of the key finding  regarding  the
        credibility of Mr Thaci and the existence of an  active  feud.  The
        Judge refers to a feud but should have properly considered whether,
        if one actually exists, it is active -  especially  in  a  case  in
        which the last alleged killing was in 1962, Mr Thaci's  father  who
        is said to have been responsible for the killings has been able  to
        live it the village next door to the said victims  family  with  no
        evidence of attempts to kill him, and to live a relatively 'normal'
        life as evidenced by his marriage and ability  to  raise  a  family
        openly.


    12. Great care has to be taken before denying a party  the  benefit  of
        credibility findings made in his or her favour, but  such  findings
        are only sustainable if the required degree of anxious scrutiny has
        been applied  to  the  facts  and  proper  consideration  given  to
        relevant issues. I find Mr Mills has discharged the burden of proof
        upon him to prove this is a case in which the  required  degree  of
        care and/or understanding of the issues have not been  demonstrated
        in the determination.


    13. I find legal  error  proved  for  these  reasons  material  to  the
        decision to allow the appeal. As  the  parties  have  not  had  the
        benefit of the issues in the  case  being  properly  considered  in
        accordance  with  the  country  guidance  case  law,  I   set   the
        determination aside without there being any preserved findings. The
        following directions shall apply  to  the  future  conduct  of  the
        appeal:


              a.  The appeal shall be remitted to be re-heard by a  salaried
   judge of the                 First-tier Tribunal sitting at Sheldon Court
   Birmingham  on  the  next                 available  date  allocated   by
   Resident Judge Renton in light of the                  operational  needs
   of the Centre. Time estimate 3 hours.


              b.  Consolidated, indexed and paginated bundles shall be filed
   with the                First-tier Tribunal no later than 14 days  before
   the  hearing.  The                       bundle  shall  include  all  the
   documentary evidence being relied upon.                Witness statements
   shall stand as the evidence in chief of the maker               and  must
   be signed, dated, and contain a declaration of truth.


              c.   Any request for an interpreter must be made no later than
   14 days                 from receipt  of  these  directions  stating  the
   language and dialect                      required and  reasons  for  the
   request.


              d.  Any application to vary these directions  or  for  further
   directions                   must be made in  writing  and  addressed  to
   Resident Judge Renton at                  Sheldon Court.


Decision

    14. The Immigration Judge materially erred in  law.  I  set  aside  the
        decision of the original Immigration Judge.  The  appeal  shall  be
        remitted to the First-tier Tribunal in accordance  with  the  above
        directions.
