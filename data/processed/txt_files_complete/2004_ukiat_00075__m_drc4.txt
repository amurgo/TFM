Tutsi ethnicity - risk on return


Appearances

Mr A Scarcliffe appeared for the Appellant.
Mr M. Khan, Counsel instructed by Drummond Miller Solicitors,  appeared  for
the Respondent.

                     DETERMINATION OF APPEAL AND REASONS

1.    The Appellant, the Secretary of State, has appealed with leave of  the
      Tribunal against  a  determination  of  Adjudicator,  Miss  P  Clough,
      allowing the appeal  of  the  Respondent,  a  national  of  Democratic
      Republic of Congo (DRC), against the decision to refuse to grant leave
      to enter on asylum grounds.  To  avoid  confusion  the  Respondent  is
      hereafter referred to as the "Claimant".  This  case  is  reported  in
      order to provide Tribunal guidance on whether persons perceived as  of
      Tutsi ethnicity are currently at risk in the DRC.


2.    The Adjudicator did not find the  Claimant's  account  credible  in  a
      number of respects. In particular she did not accept his claim to have
      been arrested and detained in Kinshasa. However, she did  accept  that
      his mother was a Tutsi and that although having  a  Bantu  father  the
      Claimant would be perceived as of Tutsi ethnicity.

3.    The Adjudicator's conclusions were that the Claimant had not made  out
      his asylum grounds of appeal, but  had  established  a  real  risk  of
      treatment contrary to Arts 2 and 3 of the ECHR, by virtue of the  risk
      he would run as someone perceived to be of Tutsi ethnicity.

4.    Remarkably, although  she  gave  reasons  for  dismissing  the  asylum
      grounds of appeal, she gave none for allowing the Arts 2 and 3 grounds
      of appeal beyond saying he would be perceived as of  Tutsi  ethnicity.
      She did at paragraph 12 summarise the background evidence relating  to
      Tutsis; but since it noted a  significant  decrease  in  human  rights
      abuses committed against Tutsis during 2002 and referred to continuing
      discrimination - but not  continuing  persecution  -  against  persons
      perceived as of Tutsi origin, it is difficult to treat that  reference
      as the basis for her conclusion.

5.    The  grounds  of  appeal   contended  that  the  Adjudicator  was  not
      entitled to allow the Arts 2 and 3 grounds of appeal because there was
      no evidence that the abuse of the human rights of persons perceived as
      of Tutsi origin were the subject of "a consistent  pattern  of  gross,
      flagrant or mass violations of human rights". They  cited  in  support
      the Court of Appeal judgment in Harari [2003] EWCA Civ 807. They  also
      cited other passages from the CIPU report for 2003 indicating that the
      government has continued since 2001 to protect  Tutsis  in  government
      controlled territory who are at risk.

6.    There was no Respondent's Notice nor any  form  of  challenge  to  the
      Adjudicator's adverse credibility findings. Mr Khan  confined  himself
      to arguing that the background materials did demonstrate that  persons
      perceived as of Tutsi origin still face a real risk  of  serious  harm
      and that such persons are also perceived as Rwandan and  therefore  at
      risk because of the hostile approach of the authorities to persons  of
      Rwandan nationality.

7.    We consider that the Adjudicator's determination is seriously flawed.

8.    In the first place it  is  impossible  to  reconcile  her  conclusions
      under the Refugee Convention and under the Human Rights Convention. On
      the one hand, she stated that she considered the Claimant had not left
      the DRC due to persecution because of his ethnicity. On the other hand
      she found that he would be at Art 3 risk because of his ethnicity.  As
      the Tribunal and courts have repeatedly  emphasised,  under  both  the
      Refugee Convention and Arts 2 and 3 there is  a  common  threshold  of
      risk. If the Adjudicator believed that someone perceived as  of  Tutsi
      origin would be subjected to serious harm under  Arts  2  and  3,  she
      should have concluded he would  face  persecution  under  the  Refugee
      Convention. Alternatively, if she considered that such a person  would
      not face serious harm under the Refugee  Convention,  she  should  not
      have concluded such a person would face treatment contrary to  Arts  2
      and 3. She did not suggest in this case that the clamant  only  failed
      under  the Refugee Convention because of lack of a Convention reason.

9.    In the second place, her approach to the evidence relating to  Arts  2
      and 3 risks was flawed. On her own account of it,  there  had  been  a
      significant change in the situation of the Tutsis from  2002.  As  the
      grounds of appeal properly identify, when considering  whether  Tutsis
      or  persons  perceived  as  Tutsis  per  se  would  be  at  risk,  the
      Adjudicator was not entitled to treat as decisive the mere  fact  that
      there remain some incidents of serious human rights  abuses.  She  was
      required to consider whether such incidents amounted to  a  consistent
      pattern gross, flagrant or mass violations of human rights. That  test
      was approved in Harari and more recently by the  Court  of  Appeal  in
      Batayav [2003] EWCA Civ 1489.

10.   As already noted, Mr Khan  did  not  contest  that  the  Adjudicator's
      determination was free of error, but he considered  nevertheless  that
      her findings in relation to Tutsis or persons perceived  as  of  Tutsi
      origin were sustainable. We cannot agree. The latest objective country
      materials indicate that the  situation  of  Tutsis  has  significantly
      changed in the past few years. The April 2003 CIPU Report to which the
      Adjudicator made reference, stated:

             "5.59. Since the start of the current conflict in 1998, Tutsis
             have been subjected to serious human rights  abuses,  both  in
             Kinshasa and elsewhere, by government security forces  and  by
             some citizens for perceived disloyalty to the regime. By 2001,
             the Government no longer followed a policy  of  arresting  and
             detaining members of the Tutsi ethnic group without charge and
             merely on the basis  of  their  ethnicity.  Approximately  300
             Tutsis who voluntarily entered a government protection site at
             the national Security Institute in Kinshasa remained there  at
             the end of 2001 awaiting resettlement  or  reintegration  into
             the community. Human rights abuses  committed  against  Tutsis
             significantly decreased during 2002 but  human  rights  groups
             have complained that discrimination against persons  perceived
             to be of Tutsi ethnicity [continues in] rebel-held areas ...".

11.   Mr Khan prayed in aid  the  Danish  Immigration  Report  at  paragraph
      3.4.2 entitled the Tutsi in Kinshasa: the Current Situation.  At  page
      12 this Report in a section dated 24 January 2002, it was stated:

             "With regard to the position of ethnic groups in the DRC, Jean-
             Joseph  Mukendi  of  Mulumba  (IDH)  explained   that   people
             belonging to or merely physically resembling the eastern Tutsi
             or  Hutu  communities,  usually  termed  "Rwandans",  are   in
             considerable danger of ill treatment and  persecution  at  the
             hands of the civilian population in Kinshasa.  The  relatively
             few Tutsi still present in Kinshasa (the vast majority  having
             previously been  resettled  abroad)  are  now  living  in  one
             particular district known as La Colline, where they enjoy some
             measure of protection. However, the authorities cannot protect
             that  community  against  any  abuses,  although   nobody   in
             authority attempts to prevent those who wish from leaving  the
             DRC. He emphasised  that  the  authorities  do  not  generally
             persecute the Tutsi community in Kinshasa".

12.   This report shows, he submitted, that the situation  has  deteriorated
      since the events in Kisangani in May 2002.

13.   Mr Khan also relied on the Belgian Report,  La  Voix  des  Sans  Voix,
      Interview in Kinshasa, 3 August 2002 which has a section on the  Tutsi
      Community in Kinshasa which states as follows:


             "3.4 THE TUTSI COMMUNITY IN KINSHASA


             3.4.1 CONTEXT


             When triumphantly entering Kinshasa on 17  May  1997,  at  the
             head of Alliance of Democratic Forces (AFDL) troops,  Laurent-
             Desire Kabila  brought  a  provisional  end  to  a  series  of
             multiple developments. When it broke out  in  September  1996,
             the Banyamulenge revolt (i.e. of Tutsis who had lived in South
             Kivu for decades who claimed Congolese nationality) seemed  to
             be of an internal ethno-political nature, and  the  Government
             of Rwanda did not delay in using it for its own purposes. This
             revolt was in fact an ideal opportunity to invade  the  former
             Zaire in order to pursue those loyal  to  the  late  President
             Habyarimana, a Hutu as well as the extremist Hutu militias  to
             the Interahamwe.


             In July 1998, Laurent-Desire Kabila cut  all  links  with  the
             Rwandan Government whose prot�g� he had been. This started the
             war with  Rwanda which broke out on 2 August 1998.  The  first
             Tutsis were arrested the following day in  Kinshasa. From  the
             moment that the rebels  (Rwandan  and  Congolese  citizens  of
             Tutsi origin) advanced on Kinshasa and  where  their  presence
             was  even  reported  in  the   capital's   suburbs,   Kinshasa
             experienced a real pursuit against the Tutsis. People of Tutsi
             origin or who were   presumed  to  be  of  Tutsi  origin  were
             arrested and a number of them were burnt alive or shot.


             In order to excuse themselves, the pogrom participants  argued
             that the  Congolese authorities  played a significant role  in
             stirring up anti-Tutsi hatred. During this period,  a  certain
             number of ministers in fact served as  official  spokesman  to
             designate the enemy by popular condemnation by labelling  them
             as vermin which should be exterminated at any price.


             3.4.2 THE TUTSIS IN KINSHASA: THE CURRENT SITUATION


             It emerges from numerous conversations with the  Kinois  that,
             in their eyes the Rwandans are the enemy, the occupier and the
             aggressor. Often the Kinois make no  distinction  between  the
             Tutsis, the Hutus, the Rwandans and  the  others.  During  the
             August and September 1998 pogrom, an  undetermined  number  of
             people were subjected to indiscriminate anger  simply  because
             of their appearance. The  Tutsis are  in  fact  recognised  by
             their great height, their pointed noses and their oval faces.


             In order to "protect"  them  from  popular  condemnation,  the
             Tutsis in Kinshasa were regrouped in the Kokolo military  camp
             as of November 1998 (July 1999 according to  another  source),
             the refugees were sheltered in an "accommodation site for  the
             vulnerable" which was set up in  the   INSS  (National  Social
             Security Institute)  Centre and located in the   Maman  Mobutu
             Development in Kinshasa/Mont-Ngafula. Thousands of Tutsis were
             then welcomed by third countries such as Canada,  the   United
             States,  France  and  Belgium  within  the  framework   of   a
             resettlement  programme.  The  OIM   resettled   about   1,300
             refugees. About 600 other refugees were  resettled  under  the
             auspices of the  International Red Cross Committee.


             In spite of its resettlement programmes,  about  300  refugees
             (mostly  Tutsis, but also  Hutus and  individuals  from  mixed
             marriages) remained in the   INSS  Centre  where  humanitarian
             organisations such as the  ICRC supplied  their  daily  needs.
             The Centre was run by the Congolese Human Rights Ministry  and
             Congolese police officers provided security.


             Ever since the events in Kisangani on 4 May, a slight increase
             in the number  of  refugees  in  the   INSS  Centre  has  been
             observed.   Currently,  their  number  has   risen   to   342;
             furthermore,  185 Tutsis have been hiding in the  Maman Mobutu
             Centre.

14.   We do not  consider  that  either  of  these  sources  justified   the
      interpretation Mr Khan has sought to put on them.

15.   Firstly, we note that both confirm that as a result of  1998  progroms
      against Tutsis the authorities  in conjunction  with  the   ICRC  took
      specific steps to protect the  Tutsi community in Kinshasa.  Secondly,
      even though the   Belgian  source  does  not  describe  the  level  of
      protection as complete,  neither  source  identifies  any  significant
      level of civilian violence against Tutsis  since  specific  protection
      steps were taken.

16.   Secondly, both sources are dated 2002.  They  do  not  deal  with  the
      situation since August 2002. As already noted, the CIPU Report,  which
      deals with developments since, identifies  a  significant  improvement
      beginning in 2001.

17.   Thirdly, we do not quite understand Mr Khan's contention that   Tutsis
      fall into a separate risk category by virtue of  being  confused  with
      Rwandans. It is clear that  the  authorities  now  protect  Tutsis  in
      Kinshasa.  If there is a failure  to  make  a   distinction  sometimes
      between Tutsis and Rwandans, it is made by civilian Kinois, not by the
      authorities.  The  latter,  to  repeat,  are  described  as  affording
      protection  to Tutsis against  civilian actions.

18.   We also consider that the argument advanced by Mr  Khan  does  not  in
      any event easily fit the particular facts relating to  this  Claimant.
      On his own account, his mother was a Congolese,  not  a  non-Congolese
      Tutsi. It appears from  the  background  sources  that  suspicion  and
      hostility against Tutsis is primarily directed  against  non-Congolese
      Tutsis.

19.   Since returns from the UK  to the  DRC are to Kinshasa  and  there  is
      no evidence to  indicate that Tutsis who originate  from  other  areas
      are prevented from remaining in that city, it is not necessary for  us
      to address the evidence relating to the treatment of Tutsis  in  other
      areas, particularly those in rebel-held areas, although we  note  that
      the CIPU refers to continuing discrimination against them, not to  any
      significant levels of violence or other forms of serious harm.

20.   Accordingly we consider that not only  did  the  Adjudicator  fail  to
      give reasons for decision to allow the  Articles 2 and  3  grounds  of
      appeal, but also that decision  was not  supported  by  the  objective
      evidence.

21.   For the above reasons this appeal is allowed.
