Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms Emma Daykin, Counsel, instructed by Farani Javid
Taylor Sols.
For the Respondent:    Ms N Willcocks-Briscoe, Senior Home Office
Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This appeal is not subject to an  anonymity  order  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal pursuant to rule 13  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (First-tier
    Tribunal) (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Rules  2014.  Neither  party
    has invited me to make an anonymity order pursuant to rule  14  of  the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  (SI  2008/2698)  and  I
    have not done so.

 2. The appellant appeals against the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge  Head-Rapson)  dismissing  the  appellant's  appeal  against   a
    decision taken on 10 October to refuse the appellant's application  for
    further leave to remain in the UK as a Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)  Migrant
    and to remove the appellant to India.

Introduction

 3. The appellant is a citizen of India born in 1987. He was granted  leave
    to enter the UK as a Tier 4 (General) Student  from  18  December  2009
    until 25 March 2012. He was then granted further leave to remain in the
    UK as a Tier 1 (Post-study Work) Migrant from 22 August 2012  until  22
    August 2014. The current application was made on 15 August 2014.

 4. The Secretary of State accepted that the appellant  had  �42,775.93  in
    his HSBC bank account  as  of  31  July  2014  but  he  had  previously
    transferred �10,000 into the Barclays Bank account  for  his  business,
    Soni (UK) Ltd. Paragraph 45 of Appendix  A  of  the  Immigration  Rules
    states that where an applicant is relying upon funds which have already
    been invested, the specified documents  listed  under  paragraph  46-SD
    must be submitted. The  appellant  had  not  met  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 46-SD(c)(iii) because there were no unaudited accounts and an
    accounts compilation report to  confirm  that  at  least  part  of  the
    appellant's funds had been invested  in  the  business.  The  documents
    submitted did not demonstrate that the appellant had access to at least
    �50,000 in personal funds as required by paragraph 41-SD(c)(ii).

 5. Furthermore, the appellant had not met the requirements at paragraph 41-
    SD(e)(vi) and paragraph  46-SD(c)(iii)  because  he  had  not  provided
    evidence from HMRC to confirm that his business had been registered for
    corporation tax.

The Appeal

 6. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal and attended an  oral
    hearing at Taylor House on 13 March 2015. He was represented  by  Mr  R
    Pennington-Benton, Counsel. The  First-tier  Tribunal  found  that  the
    appellant had failed to prove that he had submitted the  HMRC  document
    with his application and that the �10,000 deposit made by the appellant
    was excluded when assessing what a  relevant  investment  was  for  the
    purpose of the Rules. The appellant had  divested  himself  of  �10,000
    into a business bank account which of  itself  did  not  count  towards
    available funds for the purpose of the application.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

 7. The appellant sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on  the
    basis that the First-tier Tribunal had erred in  law.  Money  deposited
    into a bank account, even if it is a UK business bank  account  is  not
    counted as an investment  in  business.  The  judge  further  erred  in
    finding that there was insufficient evidence  that  the  appellant  had
    submitted his registration with HMRC at the required time, particularly
    given the fact that HMRC registration predated the date of application.

 8. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Simpson
    on 19 August 2015 on the basis that it  was  arguable  that  the  judge
    erred in treating the �10,000 as an investment. Although the  appellant
    had not indicated on the application form  that  he  has  documentation
    from HMRC that was  not  sufficient  to  show  that  it  had  not  been
    submitted, particularly as the document showed that it had been  issued
    in July 2014.

 9. Thus, the appeal came before me

Discussion

10. Ms Daykin submitted that the issues are narrow. The respondent's bundle
    clearly does not include  all  of  the  documents  submitted  with  the
    application. At page 164 of the appellant's bundle, the  letter  proves
    registration with HMRC in July 2014. The information clearly comes from
    Companies  House.  The  document  was  clearly   submitted   with   the
    application and there is no evidence otherwise from the respondent. The
    money was available to the business.

11. Ms Willcocks-Briscoe submitted that the policy guidance states that the
    �10,000 is not considered to be invested. However, the  refusal  letter
    also relies upon paragraph 41-SD (c)(ii).  In addition, the  fact  that
    the HMRC document was available in July 2014 does not mean that it  was
    submitted with the application. There is insufficient evidence to  show
    that it was submitted.

12. Ms Daykin submitted in reply that the judge did not make a  finding  on
    paragraph 41-SD(c)(ii) - the money is available to the business and  is
    evidenced as required.

13. It is common ground that the judge erred in treating the �10,000 in the
    Barclays account as an investment and therefore subject to paragraph 46-
    SD(a)(ii). The policy guidance at A21 is clear, money  deposited  in  a
    bank account, even if it is in  a  UK  business  bank  account  is  not
    counted as investment in business. I also find that the judge erred  at
    paragraph 35 by stating in relation to the  HMRC  document  that,  "The
    fact is that the Home Office did not receive it with the  documents  to
    be considered at the date of decision". There was  no  direct  evidence
    before the judge that the respondent did not receive the HMRC document.
    The issue for the judge was whether on  balance  of  probabilities  the
    appellant had proved that the HMRC  document  was  submitted  with  the
    application. Reaching a conclusion before considering the  evidence  is
    not a permissible approach and is a further material error of law.

14. The judge did not consider paragraph 41-SD(c)(ii). There may  be  merit
    in that ground for refusal but it has not been tested by the First-tier
    Tribunal. There are substantial  issues  of  fact  that  remain  to  be
    resolved.

15. Thus, the First-tier Tribunal's decision  to  dismiss  the  appellant's
    appeal under the Rules involved the making of an error of law  and  its
    decision cannot stand.



Decision

16. Ms Daykin invited me to remake the decision and to  allow  the  appeal.
    Bearing in mind  paragraph  7.2  of  the  Senior  President's  Practice
    Statements I consider that not to be an appropriate course  of  action.
    There are substantial issues of fact to be resolved and a re-hearing is
    required. I find that the errors of law infect the decision as a  whole
    and therefore the re-hearing will be de novo  with  all  issues  to  be
    considered again by the First-tier Tribunal.

17. Consequently, I set aside the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal.  I
    order the appeal to be heard again in the  First-Tier  Tribunal  to  be
    determined de novo by a judge other than the previous First-tier judge.


Signed                          Date 30 January 2016
