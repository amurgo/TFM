Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms M O'Brien, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms M Gavin, solicitor

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant in these proceedings is the Secretary of State.  However,
    for convenience I refer to the parties as they were before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal.

 2. Thus, the appellant is a citizen of Turkey born on 2 July 1978.   On  4
    June 2013 he made an application for leave to remain as a spouse.  That
    application was refused in a decision dated 15 August 2013.

 3. The appellant's appeal against that  decision  came  before  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Mozolowski on 29 January 2015  whereby  the  appeal  was
    dismissed under the Immigration  Rules  but  allowed  on  human  rights
    grounds, the judge stating that a period of leave for nine months would
    be appropriate.

 4. Permission to appeal against the  First-tier  judge's  decision  having
    been granted, the appeal came before me.

 5. The respondent refused the application for leave to remain as a  spouse
    with reference to paragraph 284(ix)(a) on the basis that the  appellant
    had not supplied an English language  test  certificate  in  accordance
    with the Rules, and had not provided evidence to support the claim that
    he has a physical or mental  condition  that  would  prevent  him  from
    meeting that requirement.  The respondent  went  on  to  consider,  and
    refuse, the application with reference to  the  Article  8  Immigration
    Rules.

 6. In her determination the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  noted  that  the
    appellant had been diagnosed at school in Turkey  as  having  dyslexia.
    He had finished school and worked as a chef in a Turkish hotel where he
    met the sponsor who was on holiday at the time that their  relationship
    developed.

 7. He had attempted on four occasions to sit the Life in the  UK  test  in
    2009 and failed on each occasion.  He arrived in the UK in 2005 with  a
    valid spouse visa and has been granted extensions of leave  since  that
    time.  He now works as  a  chef  in  Northern  Ireland,  earning  about
    ï¿½13,000 per annum.  He and the sponsor, his spouse, have no children.

 8. The judge referred to a further issue raised at the hearing before  her
    to the effect that the appellant, as well as suffering  from  dyslexia,
    has "mental health issues" and mild  cognitive  impairment,  suggesting
    that it was impossible for him to sit an English language test.   Thus,
    it was argued that he fell within an exception to  the  requirement  of
    providing a  speaking  and  listening  test  certificate  in  terms  of
    paragraph 284(ix)(a)(ii), having a mental condition which would prevent
    him from meeting that particular requirement.

 9. At [11] of the determination the judge said that the appellant had  not
    provided to the respondent with his application form any indication  of
    the problems which it is said would result in him falling within one of
    the exceptions to the English language requirement.   Accordingly,  she
    concluded that it was not surprising that the  appellant's  application
    was refused on the basis of the information put before the  respondent.



10. After considering further evidence put before her, in conjunction  with
    the submissions made on behalf of the parties, she  concluded  at  [17]
    that the appellant had not shown  that  he  falls  within  any  of  the
    exceptions  which  would  prevent  him  meeting  the  English  language
    requirement.  She gave detailed reasons for coming to that view.   This
    included consideration of an educational  psychologist's  report.   She
    referred to the appellant's heavy drinking as a significant problem  in
    terms of his apparent anxiety and overall difficulties.

11. In considering the Immigration Rules in terms of Article 8,  the  judge
    concluded that the appellant did not meet the private life requirements
    of the Rules.  She also concluded that with reference to  EX.1  it  had
    not been demonstrated  that  there  were  insurmountable  obstacles  to
    family life between the appellant and his wife  continuing  in  Turkey.
    Again, there was a comprehensive review and assessment of the  evidence
    on that issue.

12. With reference to Article 8 proper, she accepted that the appellant and
    the sponsor were in a genuine and subsisting relationship, and had been
    together for over 10 years.  She accepted at [34]  that  the  appellant
    "has a degree of mental illness in the form of anxiety and depression".
     However, she concluded that this appeared to be at the  lower  end  of
    the  spectrum.   She  did  however,  accept  that  the  appellant  "may
    possibly" have cognitive deficits or low IQ.

13. She observed that the appellant's status in  the  UK  had  always  been
    lawful and that he has tried at all times not to be  a  burden  on  the
    state.

14. After again considering various features of  the  evidence  put  before
    her, she  found  at  [39]  that  the  appellant's  dyslexia  would  not
    necessarily prevent him  from  sitting  an  English  language  test  in
    speaking and listening.  She referred to the appellant having family in
    Turkey who appeared to be supportive, although he had made ties  within
    the community in Northern Ireland, and  not  just  within  the  Turkish
    community.

15. She also noted at [39] that the appellant  is  not  able  to  meet  the
    requirements of the Rules, although the consequences  of  returning  to
    Turkey and "splitting up a genuine relationship"  must  also  be  taken
    into account [43].  She referred to what was  described  as  a  suicide
    attempt by the appellant.

16. At [45] she stated as follows:

         "I also take into account the misunderstanding that  there  appears
         to have arisen about the Appellant's inability to take  an  English
         language test due to dyslexia and note  that  the  application  was
         made by the Appellant without  the  benefit  of  legal  advice.   I
         therefore consider that the Appellant should be allowed  to  remain
         further in the United Kingdom on Article 8 grounds for a period  of
         9 months from the date of promulgation of this  decision  to  allow
         the Appellant time to prepare more fully for a further spouse  visa
         and deal with the issue of  the  English  language  test  far  more
         fully, either by sitting the test or claiming an  exemption  backed
         up with good  medical  grounds  and  clear  reports.   The  present
         medical evidence that is currently before me is patchy  and,  as  I
         have indicated can  only  be  relied  upon  to  a  limited  degree.
         However it cannot be ignored about his visa status (sic).  With his
         mental illness,  the  Appellant  has  only  limited  tolerance  for
         uncertainty as shown in the one vague suicide attempt."

17. In the next paragraph she stated that the respondent's decision:

         "would cause the United Kingdom to be in breach of the law  or  its
         obligations under the Human Rights Convention to a  limited  extent
         and [I]  consider  that  a  period  of  9  months  leave  would  be
         appropriate."

18. She thus dismissed the appeal under the Immigration Rules  but  allowed
    it on human rights grounds "for a period of 9 months" [48].







    Grounds and Submissions

19. Prior to the hearing there was an indication that the appellant had now
    taken and passed an English language test.  At the hearing both parties
    indicated that they were aware that that  was  the  case.   Ms  O'Brien
    pointed out that there was no cross appeal on behalf of  the  appellant
    in terms of the dismissal of the appeal under the Immigration Rules.

20. The grounds of appeal before the Upper Tribunal on behalf of respondent
    point out that the appellant had already attempted the English language
    test on four previous occasions and failed.  Having  found  that  there
    were no insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing  in  Turkey,
    allowing the appeal under Article 8 proper  to  give  the  appellant  a
    fifth chance to sit his English language test was an error of  law,  it
    is argued.

21. I raised with the parties the issue of the new  English  language  test
    certificate provided by the appellant and whether in the circumstances,
    if it was an acceptable English language  test,  the  respondent  would
    withdraw the decision under appeal.  Ms O'Brien took  instructions  and
    indicated that there was  some  difficulty  in  terms  of  whether  the
    certificate now provided is acceptable.  The preliminary view was  that
    it was not an acceptable English language test  certificate  under  the
    Rules.

22. Ms  Gavin  pointed  out  that  such  a  certificate,  being  a  Pearson
    certificate, had long been accepted  and  such  certificates  had  been
    submitted by other applicants in the past.  However, she did  not  have
    evidence that it was on the relevant approved list.

23. After a further opportunity for the respondent to take instructions  it
    was confirmed on behalf of the respondent  that  the  test  certificate
    provided by the appellant is not currently on the transitional list  or
    on any future list  which  comes  into  force  from  5  November  2015.
    Accordingly, the certificate is not valid in terms of its  meeting  the
    terms of the Rules it was said.

24. The test certificate provided was an Edexcel ESOL Skills for Life  test
    in speaking and listening - Entry 3, dated March  2015.   The  test  is
    apparently administered or overseen by Pearson.

25. Ms Gavin submitted that she had contacted the  organisation  where  the
    appellant had taken the test and the director of that organisation  had
    sent her an email from Pearson stating that the  ESOL  test  was  still
    valid until November 2015.   Ms  Gavin  indicated  that  she  had  some
    concerns about whether it was possible on the day  of  the  hearing  to
    check the validity of the test and establish whether it was  acceptable
    or not.

26. More widely in submissions, Ms O'Brien submitted that having  concluded
    that the appellant is not able to meet the requirements of the Rules in
    terms of EX.1, it was irrational and perverse for her to go on to allow
    the appeal under Article 8.  Here the judge had evidently used  Article
    8 to dispense with the Rules.  She had failed to take into account  her
    own finding that family life could be enjoyed elsewhere.

27. Ms Gavin suggested that the failed attempts by the appellant in  taking
    a test related to the Life in the UK test as is clear  from  [8],  [13]
    and [19].  He had not in fact taken an English language test previously
    at all.  It was submitted that there were good grounds for the judge to
    allow the appeal under Article 8 proper.

28. The judge took into account the difficulties that there would be in the
    appellant returning to Turkey.  The judge took into account the  length
    of time the appellant  had  lived  in  the  UK.   His  integration  was
    constrained by the English language test issue, but he had now passed a
    test.  The judge took  into  account  all  the  circumstances  and  her
    decision that the appellant should be granted leave for nine months  to
    pass the test was appropriate.

    My assessment

29. At the conclusion of the hearing I reserved my decision.  I  also  gave
    directions designed  to  allow  a  further  opportunity  for  the  test
    certificate provided by the appellant to be checked to see  whether  it
    was an  approved  test  for  the  purposes  of  paragraph  284  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

30. In a response from the respondent, the position provisionally taken  at
    the hearing was confirmed, namely that the test certificate offered  is
    not acceptable proof of competence "as it does not appear on  the  list
    of transitional SELT in Appendix O".  It is further  indicated  in  the
    letter from the respondent that the  certificate  proffered  would  not
    have been acceptable as at the date of application in June 2013.

31. No further information has been provided on behalf of the appellant  as
    to the validity of the latest English language test dated March 2015 in
    terms of its meeting the requirements of the Rules.

32. The appellant is not able to meet the  requirements  of  the  Rules  in
    terms of paragraph 284(ix)(a) with reference to  the  English  language
    requirement.  The judge concluded that he had not established that  his
    physical or  mental  condition  would  prevent  him  from  meeting  the
    requirement.  She did not conclude, nor does it  appear  to  have  been
    argued, that there were exceptional  compassionate  circumstances  that
    would prevent him  from  meeting  the  requirement  under  subparagraph
    (iii).

33. In considering EX.1 she concluded that the  appellant  could  not  meet
    those  requirements,  concluding  that  there  were  no  insurmountable
    obstacles to family life continuing in Turkey.

34. However, at [43] she stated that "the consequences of returning back to
    Turkey and splitting up a genuine relationship must also be taken  into
    account", with reference to Article 8 proper.  However,  on  the  basis
    that she had  already  concluded  that  there  were  no  insurmountable
    obstacles to family life  continuing  in  Turkey,  there  would  be  no
    question  of  their  relationship  being   severed.    Similarly,   the
    conclusion at [44] that "a complete refusal of the Appellant (sic) with
    the likelihood of his remaining in Turkey  permanently  must  be  taken
    into account which must also take into account his mental  illness"  is
    also  inconsistent  with  what  was  concluded  about  there  being  no
    insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing in Turkey.

35. The justification for allowing the appeal under Article  8  appears  to
    have been to allow the appellant "time to  prepare  more  fully  for  a
    further spouse visa and deal with the issue  of  the  English  language
    test far more  fully,  either  by  sitting  the  test  or  claiming  an
    exemption backed up with good medical grounds and clear reports".  This
    was combined with what the  judge  said  about  the  appellant's  "visa
    status" and his mental illness, the appellant  only  having  a  limited
    tolerance for uncertainty as shown in the one "vague" suicide  attempt.



36. However, the fact of the matter is that the appellant was not  able  to
    meet the requirements of the Article 8 Rules.  The judge concluded that
    there were no insurmountable obstacles to  family  life  continuing  in
    Turkey.  It is trite that Article 8 does not  give  a  right  to  chose
    where family life is to be exercised.

37. In addition, the conclusion at  [46]  that  the  respondent's  decision
    would cause the United Kingdom "to be in  breach  of  the  law  or  its
    obligations under the Human Rights Convention" is inexplicable in terms
    of its reference to the decision being "in breach of the law".   It  is
    not clear what the judge meant by this.

38. The conclusion that the decision  would  breach  the  UK's  obligations
    under the Convention "to a limited extent" does not,  with  respect  to
    the judge, make sense in the context  of  this  appeal.   The  decision
    either would or would not be in breach of the Convention.

39. I am satisfied that in allowing the appeal under Article 8  the  First-
    tier Judge erred in law.  The  appellant  was  not  able  to  meet  the
    requirements of the Article 8 Rules and the judge found that there were
    no insurmountable obstacles to their continuing family life in  Turkey.
    The conclusion that the appeal should be allowed under Article 8 "to  a
    limited extent" is in itself irrational and inconsistent with  her  own
    conclusions.  The analysis under the Rules could not on  the  facts  of
    this  appeal  have  yielded  a  different  outcome  under  Article   8.
    Accordingly, I set the decision aside.

40. The re-making of  the  decision  relates  only  to  Article  8  proper.
    Although the appellant has taken an English language test  and  passed,
    in March 2015, that is not a test that complies with  the  requirements
    of the Rules in terms of  it  being  from  an  approved  provider.   No
    evidence has been submitted on behalf of the appellant to suggest  that
    it  is,  and  there  have  been  no  submissions  to   contradict   the
    respondent's contention that it is  not  a  qualifying  test.   In  any
    event, there has been no appeal on behalf of the appellant in terms  of
    the appeal having been dismissed under the Rules.

41. The fact that the appellant is still not able to meet the  requirements
    of the Rules is plainly pertinent to  the  re-making  of  the  decision
    under Article 8.

42. In the light of the judge's factual conclusions, I  am  satisfied  that
    the respondent has established that the decision is a proportionate one
    in all the circumstances.  Accordingly, the appeal under Article  8  of
    the ECHR is dismissed.







    Decision

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    on a point of law.  Its decision is set aside.  I re-make the  decision
    by dismissing the appeal, both under the Immigration  Rules  and  under
    Article 8 of the ECHR.
