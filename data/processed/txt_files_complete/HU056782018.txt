Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr T Wilding, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Appellant in person


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1. I have considered whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  an
anonymity direction. No anonymity direction was made previously  in  respect
of this Appellant. Having considered all the circumstances  and  evidence  I
do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.


2. The Secretary of State for the Home Department brings this appeal but  in
order to avoid confusion the parties are referred to as  they  were  in  the
First-tier Tribunal. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  against  a
decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Spicer,  promulgated  on  21  November
2018 which allowed the Appellant's appeal.

Background


3. The Appellant was born on 28 August 1986 and is a  national  of  Nigeria.
On  10  February  2018  the  Secretary  of  State  refused  the  Appellant's
application for indefinite leave to remain in the UK  on  the  basis  of  10
years lawful residence.

The Judge's Decision

4. The Appellant appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal.  First-tier  Tribunal
Judge Spicer ("the Judge")  allowed  the  appeal  against  the  Respondent's
decision. Grounds of appeal were lodged and,  on  27  December  2018,  Judge
Hollingworth granted permission to appeal stating

    "The sole issue as the  Judge  states  this  at  paragraph  22  of  the
    decision relates to paragraph 322(5). It is arguable that the Judge has
    not sufficiently engaged with the matrix of factors put forward by  the
    respondent in the  case  dealing  with  the  relationship  between  the
    totality of hours capable of or potentially worked and the  receipt  of
    income upon which the appellant was taxed.  It  is  arguable  that  the
    evidential burden switched and that insufficient evidence  was  adduced
    by the appellant. In the alternative it is arguable that the  inference
    is capable of being drawn from the hourly rate given that the appellant
    worked for the same employer and given  the  type  of  work  would  not
    support the conclusion reached by the Judge in relation to 20  hours  a
    week of work over the relevant periods."

The Hearing

5. (a) Mr Wilding moved the grounds of appeal. He told me that at  [19]  the
Judge summarises the evidence, and then at  [27]  &  [28]  the  Judge  makes
findings of fact which, Mr  Wilding  said,  are  unsustainable  because  the
Judge did not properly analyse the periods for which  the  appellant  worked
between the tax years from 2013 to 2015. He told me that it is not  disputed
that the appellant worked, and it is not disputed that the figures  for  his
income were accurate. Mr Wilding argued that it is  difficult  to  reconcile
the amount the appellant earned in each tax year with  the  hours  that  the
appellant was allowed to work. He said that  the  appellant  would  have  to
have an hourly rate of pay more than ï¿½30 per hour if he  had  worked  within
the permitted hours only.

(b) Mr Wilding told me that the Judge's error was to take the  total  figure
that the appellant earned each tax year and not  compare  that  against  the
short period for which the appellant was allowed to work. He  told  me  that
the absence of that analysis is a material error of law. He urged me to  set
the decision aside and to continue the case to a  further  hearing  in  this
tribunal so that another decision can be substituted.

6. The appellant told me that the decision does  not  contain  an  error  of
law, material or otherwise. He told me that he was allowed to  work  for  20
hours each week as a student  and  allowed  to  work  full-time  during  his
holidays. He told  me  when  the  holiday  periods  are  factored  into  the
calculation, it could be seen that he did not work when he was  not  allowed
to do so. The appellant told me that he has lived in the UK  for  18  years.
He worked honestly and paid tax on his earnings. He  told  me  that  he  has
been treated unfairly by the Secretary of State  because,  if  there  was  a
discrepancy, it should have been picked  up  in  earlier  applications  made
over the last five years. He emphasised that he is  a  law-abiding  citizen.
He asked me to dismiss the appeal and allow the Judge's decision to stand.

Analysis

7. The appellant accepts that three grants of leave to  remain  contained  a
condition prohibiting either working or recourse to public funds. The  Judge
finds at [27] that from 6 April 2013 to 12 August  2013  the  appellant  had
permission to work and from 21 February 2015 to 5 April 2015  the  appellant
had permission to work. The appellant insists that  he  has  not  worked  in
breach of the conditions of leave to remain UK.

8. The figures obtained from HMRC for the appellants earned income  for  the
tax years 2013/14 and 20 14/15 go without challenge. In submissions  to  the
First-tier Tribunal, the respondent's position was that  the  appellant  was
not allowed to work between 12 August 2013  and  1  April  2014;  between  3
April 2014 and 30 July 2014; and between 10  October  2014  and  26  January
2015.

9. There was no evidence of the appellant's  hourly  rate  of  pay,  and  no
submissions were made by the respondent about the nature of the  appellant's
employment, nor about  the  appellant's  earning  capacity,  nor  about  the
appellant's hourly rate of pay. No evidence  was  produced  from  HMRC.  The
appellant simply accepted the figures rehearsed in the reasons  for  refusal
letter.

10. The respondent's assertion that the appellant worked in  breach  of  his
conditions  has  consistently  been  met  with  a  blanket  denial  by   the
appellant. The respondent  did  not  produce  evidence  of  the  appellant's
earnings, nor of  the  appellant's  national  insurance  contributions.  The
respondent produced no evidence of the dates that the appellant worked.  The
arithmetical calculation  contained  at  1(d)  &  (e)  of  the  respondent's
grounds of appeal was not argued before the First-tier Judge.

11. In the absence of evidence to support the respondent's position, it  was
open to the Judge to make the findings at [27] of the decision and to  reach
the conclusion at [28] of the decision - that on the evidence  led,  and  on
the facts as the Judge found them to be, it is not possible to be  satisfied
that the appellant breached the conditions of leave to remain in the UK.

12. The conclusion at [28] is sustainable and does not  contain  a  material
error of law. In the absence of evidence from which  the  Judge  could  have
made findings of fact the respondent  wants  the  Judge  to  proceed  on  an
assumption. The Judge is correct not to do so.

13. The Judge's decision takes an unfortunate turn at [29]  and  [30]  where
the Judge considers paragraph 322(5) of the immigration rules, when in  fact
the respondent's decision was made by reference to 322(3). Mr  Wilding  told
me that he would not pursue that point. He candidly accepted  that  if  [28]
stands, then [29] and [30] are irrelevant

14. In Shizad (sufficiency of reasons: set aside) [2013] UKUT 85  (IAC)  the
Tribunal held that (i) Although there is  a  legal  duty  to  give  a  brief
explanation of the conclusions on the central issue on which  an  appeal  is
determined, those reasons need not be extensive if the decision as  a  whole
makes sense, having regard to the  material  accepted  by  the  judge;  (ii)
Although a decision may contain an error of law where  the  requirements  to
give adequate reasons are not met, the Upper  Tribunal  would  not  normally
set aside a decision of the First-tier Tribunal  where  there  has  been  no
misdirection of law, the fact-finding process cannot be criticised  and  the
relevant  Country  Guidance  has  been  taken  into  account,   unless   the
conclusions the judge draws from the primary data were not  reasonably  open
to him or her.

15. A fair reading of the decision demonstrates that the Judge  applied  the
correct test in law. The Judge carried out a holistic assessment of  all  of
the  evidence.  There  is  nothing  wrong  with  the  Judge's   fact-finding
exercise. There was no reliable evidential basis before the Judge  for  what
is now argued before me. The respondent might not like the  conclusion  that
the Judge arrived at, but that conclusion is the  result  of  the  correctly
applied legal equation. The correct  test  in  law  has  been  applied.  The
decision does not contain a material error of law.

16.   The decision does not contain a material error  of  law.  The  Judge's
decision stands.

DECISION

17.   The appeal is dismissed. The  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal,
promulgated on 21 November 2018, stands.
