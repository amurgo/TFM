For the Respondent:    Ms Manjit Dogra, Counsel instructed by Worldwide
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   In this decision the Appellant is  referred  to  as  the  ECO  and  the
    Respondent is referred to as the Claimant.

2.   The Claimant, a national of Pakistan, date of birth 29  December  1992,
    appealed against the ECO's decision with  reference  to  paragraph  EC-
    P.1.1 of Appendix FM.  The application was refused on  the  basis  that
    the ECO disputed the genuine and continuing  relationship  between  the
    Claimant and Sponsor, her husband, in  the  United  Kingdom,  Mr  Abdul
    Hamid  Nizami.  Secondly,  the  Sponsor's  earnings,  calculated   with
    reference to paragraph 9 of  Appendix  FM-SE,  had  not  been  properly
    established with supporting evidence.

3.   An appeal came before First-tier Tribunal Judge  Freer  on  30  January
    2015 whose decision was promulgated on or about 6  February  2015.   By
    then it had  become  apparent  that  the  ECO  had  applied  the  wrong
    consideration to  the  relevant  documentation  because  the  Sponsor's
    evidence related to him as a 'shareholder' and 'salaried worker' rather
    than in any capacity as a 'director of a limited company'.

4.   Be that as it may,  what  was  clear  was  that  even  in  the  correct
    capacity, the Sponsor could not provide  the  required  evidence  under
    Appendix FM-SE; required bank statements to evidence the earnings which
    met the requirements under the  Rules  in  the  sum  of  ï¿½18,600.   The
    difficulty arose because the Sponsor was paid in part in cash which was
    not put through any bank account: There were  not  the  necessary  bank
    statements to evidence the income received as claimed.

5.   The fact of the matter was that  the  Sponsor's  income,  had  it  been
    properly evidenced, would have met the  relevant  financial  threshold.
    The judge who dealt with the appeal was  satisfied  that  there  was  a
    genuine  relationship  but,  unfortunately,  as  the  grounds  by   the
    Secretary of State dated 16 February 2015  and  the  permission  of  30
    March 2015 by Upper Tribunal Judge Martin show, is  that  the  Claimant
    through  the  Sponsor's  could  not  evidence  the  relevant  financial
    requirements of specified evidence under Appendix  FM  come  what  may.
    Thus when the judge allowed the appeal for  the  reasons  that  he  did
    erred in law in failing to  deal  with  that  documentary  requirements
    issue.

6.   After the grant of permission Ms Dogra  provided  a  Rule  24  response
    from  the  Claimant  which  made  plain  that  it  was  accepted  those
    requirements of Appendix FM-SC relating to the  Sponsor  could  not  be
    met.  However, Ms Dogra had raised the issue in her  skeleton  argument
    before Judge Freer that if the judge was satisfied  that  there  was  a
    continuing  and  durable  relationship  between  the  Sponsor  and  the
    Claimant, bearing in mind the findings the judge might make in relation
    to the required level of earnings, she submitted that the appeal should
    succeed under Article 8 of the ECHR.

7.    Despite  the  judge's  error  in  failing  to   properly   apply   the
    requirements of Appendix  FM-SC  he  never  went  on  to  consider  the
    subsidiary Article 8 argument.  This was an  error.   The  question  is
    whether it is a material error of law that makes any difference to  the
    outcome.

8.   Mr Avery submitted that the Sponsor's unhappy position is to  a  degree
    of his own making because he has not run the cash receipts through  his
    bank account.  The cash payments must be evidenced and no more or  less
    than that should have happened;  whether  by  a  fresh  application  or
    otherwise.  The Sponsor should have started putting the relevant monies
    through his bank account and then there would be the required evidence.
     Essentially, Mr Avery said what was required was a  fresh  application
    with the appropriate evidence that the earnings or receipts went into a
    bank account: In the light of all other matters  being  considered  the
    fresh application would be allowed and entry clearance granted.   There
    was no need to have recourse to Article 8 ECHR to  try  and  resolve  a
    practical problem, namely the way the Sponsor  was  not  recording  his
    cash earnings.

9.   Ms Dogra said whilst this  may  be  so  essentially  the  Claimant  and
    Sponsor have been unwillingly separated.  How it came to pass that this
    issue has not been dealt with  before  was  not  a  matter  within  her
    knowledge. In any event the circumstances were such as to  engage  with
    Article 8 and amount to the  kind  of  compelling  circumstances  where
    Article  8  is  intended  to  enable  a  person  who  cannot  meet  the
    requirements of the Rules to be allowed entry into the United Kingdom.

10.  Whilst I have some sympathy for the predicament that the Claimant  fell
    into and the disadvantages that there were both in the  original  error
    by the ECO concerning the nature of the application,  nevertheless  the
    fact of the matter is that it is a requirement of the Rules  that  have
    been approved and adopted. I do not see in the light of  the  case  law
    typically illustrated by the case of SS (Congo)  [2015]  EWCA  Civ  387
    that the problems faced by an individual with the Rules for matters  of
    form are to be circumvented by the  application  of  Article  8  unless
    there  truly  are  compelling  circumstances  which  show  refusal   is
    disproportionate.

11.  The Court of Appeal in SS (Congo) also considered the case  of  one  of
    the Appellants BB (Pakistan) at paragraphs 77-82 of the Court of Appeal
    decision. It seemed clear in the light of the judgment of Lord  Justice
    Richards that  the  Appellant,  faced  with  the  difficulties  of  the
    Sponsor's documentation, was not able to avoid the consequences of  the
    specified evidence requirements; which have  similar  standing  to  the
    other requirements under the Rules.

12.  Accordingly I find that the judge's failure to address  Article  8  was
    an error but the failure ultimately is not material to the  outcome  of
    the decision because I do not think any Tribunal properly engaging with
    the issue would have reached the conclusion that the decision,  had  it
    been properly made, engaged Article 8 ECHR and would have  led  to  the
    Claimant's entry into the United Kingdom on that basis.

13.  For these reasons I was satisfied that the Original Tribunal  had  made
    an error of law. The parties did not object to the matter being  remade
    in the Upper Tribunal. Ms Dogra relied upon her submissions on  Article
    8 ECHR. However in view of my conclusions on Article 8 I  find  such  a
    claim on these facts fails.

NOTICE OF DECISION

12.  The Original Tribunal's decision was in error of  law.   The  following
    decision is substituted.

13.  The appeal of the Claimant is dismissed.

14.  No anonymity order is made.
