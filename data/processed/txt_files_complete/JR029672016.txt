                          - - - - - - - - - - - - -


THE HONOURABLE MR JUSTICE LAVENDER:

1.   This is an application  for  judicial  review  of  a  decision  by  the
    Secretary of State  on  11  December  2015  to  refuse  to  revoke  the
    deportation order which was made  in  consequence  of  the  applicant's
    conviction on 17 March 2010 on two counts of attempted  murder  and  an
    offence of possessing a prohibited  weapon  and  ammunition  without  a
    certificate.  He was sentenced on 23 April 2010 to concurrent sentences
    of ten years' detention and four years' detention, the overall sentence
    being ten years.

2.   The applicant's circumstances are that he is a national  of  the  Ivory
    Coast.  He was born on 27 January 1993.  He came to the United  Kingdom
    on 25 August 2003 with his mother  and  her  spouse,  who  was  an  EEA
    national exercising treaty rights.  However, his mother and her  spouse
    separated at some time in 2003.

3.   The applicant has not appeared and is not represented at this  hearing.
     The court has received two letters from  the  applicant's  solicitors.
    The first was dated 19 January and the second dated 23  January,  which
    says that:-

         "Our position, as expressed in the letter of  19  January  2017  is
         that as a result of information received recently, we can no longer
         continue to represent the applicant in this  matter.   However,  we
         are not able to withdraw  the  applicant's  judicial  review  claim
         without taking his instructions.

         We have attempted  to  make  contact  with  the  applicant  but  we
         understand that he is currently undergoing mental health issues and
         is not willing to see people."

4.   No further communication has been received from the  applicant  or  his
    solicitors.   In  particular,  no  material  has   been   provided   to
    substantiate the reference to mental  health  issues  or  evidence  his
    inability to attend the hearing today, of which it appears that  he  is
    aware.

5.   In those circumstances I am invited to proceed  with  this  hearing  in
    the absence of the applicant and I have judged it appropriate to do so,
    especially having regard to  the  time  which  has  elapsed  since  the
    application was  brought,  it  being  filed  on  16  March  2016.   The
    applicant is aware of  this  hearing  and  has  not  appeared,  in  the
    circumstances to which I have referred.

6.   In terms of Rule 38,  I  am  satisfied  that  the  applicant  has  been
    notified of the hearing and I consider that it is in the  interests  of
    justice to proceed with the hearing.

7.   I have been shown the relevant provisions  of  the  Citizens  Directive
    and the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006.

8.   There are three grounds for judicial review, although in  fact  grounds
    2 and 3 are parasitic on the first.   The  first  ground  is  that  the
    applicant contends that he has a right of permanent  residence  in  the
    United Kingdom.  That depends upon  the  provisions  of  the  Directive
    which are embodied in Regulation  15(1)  and,  specifically,  15(1)(b),
    which provides:-

         "15.-(1)      The following persons  shall  acquire  the  right  to
                  reside in the United Kingdom permanently-

                  ...

                  (b)  a family member of an EEA national who is not himself
                      an EEA national but who has  resided  in  the  United
                      Kingdom with the  EEA  national  in  accordance  with
                      these Regulations for a  continuous  period  of  five
                      years".

9.   The problem for this applicant are the words "with the  EEA  national",
    the EEA national in this case being his mother's spouse, who  separated
    from his mother as long ago  as  2003.   In  those  circumstances,  the
    Secretary of State was entitled to find that she was not satisfied that
    the applicant met the requirements of Regulation 15(1)(b).

10.  The second ground for judicial review is that  the  applicant  contends
    that he should have been given a notice  of  his  right  to  appeal  or
    recognition that he has a right to appeal under Regulation  16  of  the
    EEA Regulations.  The answer to that point is  that  the  Secretary  of
    State's decision to uphold her decision to deport the applicant was not
    an EEA decision as defined in Regulation 2, since it was not a decision
    made under those Regulations.  Finally, the third ground  of  challenge
    is that, when it came to giving notice  of  the  Secretary  of  State's
    decision, he was not given notice of his appeal right and  that  was  a
    breach of Regulation 5 of the  Immigration  Notices  Regulations  2003.
    Clearly,  if  he  had,  as  I  have  found,  no  appeal  rights,  those
    Regulations had nothing to bite on.  For those reasons this application
    is dismissed.

Costs

11.  I will assess the costs which must be paid by the applicant in the  sum
    of ï¿½3,000.00. ~~~~0~~~~
