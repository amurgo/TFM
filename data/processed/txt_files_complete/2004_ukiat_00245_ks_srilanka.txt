|DETERMINATION AND REASONS                                          |



The respondent, hereinafter "the claimant", is a citizen of Sri  Lanka.   He
was born on 4 December 1976 and so is now 28 years old.  In a  determination
promulgated on 15 September 2003 an Adjudicator, Mrs M M  Shanahan,  allowed
his appeal against the decision of the Secretary of State  that  removal  to
Sri Lanka was not contrary to his rights under Article 8(1) of the  European
Convention  on  Human  Rights.   It  is  against  that  decision  that   the
appellant, hereinafter "the Secretary of State" now appeals.

The claimant arrived in the United Kingdom on 27 February 1995  and  claimed
asylum  two  days  later  on  1  March  1995.   Although   the   immigration
authorities knew of his presence in the United Kingdom he was not  asked  to
respond to a SEF questionnaire until November  1999  and  again  in  January
2000.   He  did  not  respond.   He  said  that  he  did   not   know   that
questionnaires had been sent.  The Secretary of State refused his  claim  by
a letter dated 13 June 2000.  That decision came to  the  attention  of  the
claimant towards the end of 2000 when he attended the Home  Office  to  give
details of his change of address.  An appeal against  that  decision  would,
prima facie, have been hopelessly out of time and he did not seek to  appeal
it.

On 25 June 2001 his solicitors wrote to the Secretary of State  setting  out
a "human rights claim".  That was refused by  a  letter  dated  28  November
2001 and it is  against  that  decision  that  the  Adjudicator  allowed  an
appeal.

It is most regrettable that the Secretary of State took no  action  on  this
application between March 1995 and the middle  of  November  1999,  that  is
some 4ï¿½ years after he introduced himself to  the  Secretary  of  State  and
claimed asylum.  Without making any comment on  the  claimant's  failure  to
respond to a SEF it is very hard to see how he can  be  criticised  for  the
long delay between his arrival and the initial decision of the Secretary  of
State.  As the Adjudicator noted at paragraph 11 of  her  determination  for
the greater part of this time, and since his application  was  refused,  the
appellant has lived industriously  and  has  paid  his  taxes  and  national
insurance.  Additionally he has made friends and  remains  in  contact  with
his relatives in the United Kingdom.  There is no  suggestion  that  he  has
married or otherwise formed a very close relationship with  someone  but  it
might be though to his credit that he has not taken such a step  at  a  time
that his own immigration status is precarious.

Mr Lingajothy, quite rightly, reminded us that this claimant is a young  man
has been in the United Kingdom for almost all of his  adult  life.   He  has
lost contact with any family he might have in Sri Lanka and, as  far  as  we
know, has not behaved in any way to his discredit  in  the  United  Kingdom.
Mr Lingajothy was right to remind us of the importance of this  decision  to
this claimant.  If he does  have  to  return  to  Sri  Lanka,  whatever  his
circumstances there may be, there will be a  big  change  in  his  style  of
living.  The claimant is entitled to have his case considered carefully.

It may be with these things  in  mind  that  Mr  McGirr  accepted  that  the
appellant had established a "private and family life" of the kind  protected
by Article 8(1) of the European Convention on Human  Rights.   We  recognise
that the Secretary of State's grounds of appeal argue that  the  adjudicator
was wrong to find that the  claimant  had  established  a  protected  family
life.  His relatives in the United Kingdom are too distant for  that  to  be
the case unless there are special circumstances  of  a  kind  not  suggested
here.  That may well be right but it  is  immaterial  given  the  concession
that a protected "private and family life" has been established.

It was the  Secretary  of  State's  main  point  that  the  Adjudicator  had
misdirected herself because she had decided for herself whether removal  was
proportionate.  The Adjudicator did not have  the  benefit  of  the  starred
decision of the Tribunal in [2004] UKIAT 00024 M  (Croatia)*.   If  she  had
then she would probably have decided the case differently.

At paragraph 23 of M (Croatia)* the President, Ouseley J, said:

   "The  real  question,  regardless  of  whether  the  Secretary  of  State
   considered proportionality  or  whether  the  relevant  facts  have  been
   appraised differently or  have  changed,  is  whether,  at  the  date  of
   hearing, the decision that the appellant can be removed is lawful.   That
   means asking whether or not the decision that  the  appellant  should  be
   removed falls outside the range of reasonable  responses  as  to  whether
   removal would be proportionate to the interference with family life".



The President went on to explain that  it  is  well  settled  law  that  the
proportionality of removal is essentially a  matter  for  the  Secretary  of
State within the limits of individually defined reasonableness  and  it  was
not for the judiciary to determine how to  go  about  enforcing  immigration
control.  The Courts had to recognise that immigration control  was  usually
"a very weighty consideration indeed" and he said at paragraph 28  that  the
judiciary "should normally hold that a decision to remove is  unlawful  only
when the disproportion is so great that no  reasonable  Secretary  of  State
could remove in those circumstances".  It is clear to us that this is not  a
case where the decision to remove is outside the scope of decisions open  to
a  reasonable  Secretary  of  State  concerned  with  enforcing  immigration
control.

In reaching this conclusion we bear in mind  that  the  Secretary  of  State
recognises that a person's prolonged stay in the United  Kingdom,  including
an unlawful stay, should sometimes result in that person being permitted  to
remain even though he or she is not qualified under the  immigration  rules.
There are well known policy concessions to deal with such  events.   It  was
not suggested that this claimant came within the terms of  any  such  policy
and there is no reason to think that he  does.   He  has  not  been  in  the
United Kingdom for long enough for them to apply.

In the absence of special circumstances it seems to us most unlikely that  a
person who does not qualify under the concessions to  remain  will  ever  be
able to show that a decision to remove him is  unlawful  unless  it  can  be
shown that the concessions themselves are unlawful.   This  was  not  argued
before us and is not a submission that we would expect to succeed.

It follows that, although we have considerable sympathy  for  the  claimant,
the Adjudicator was wrong and we allow the Secretary of State's appeal.
