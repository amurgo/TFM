Representation:

For the Appellant:     Miss B Smith, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr Walker, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant appeals with leave, granted in the First-tier, against  a
    decision of a panel of the First-tier Tribunal consisting of the First-
    tier Tribunal Judge O'Garro and Mr  P  Bompas  non  legal  member  (the
    second panel).  The date of immigration appealed against was 14th March
    2013.  The Second panel's decision as set out  in  their  determination
    was to dismiss the  Appellant's  appeal  on  all  grounds  against  the
    immigration decision of the Respondent  to  make  a  deportation  order
    under the provisions of Section 32(5) of the UK Borders Act 2007.

 2. The four grounds that were argued were firstly a  failure  to  consider
    private life or family life of all the family members and in particular
    his  partner  Linette  Borges  and  the  impact  of   the   Appellant's
    deportation, not only upon her but also  her  daughter  Tatiana  -  the
    Appellant's step daughter.  The second ground was that the second panel
    had come to conclusions regarding the Appellant's risk  of  reoffending
    that they were not entitled to do on the  evidence,  as  there  was  no
    OASYS Report provided by the Respondent.  The third ground was that the
    panel had come to unsubstantiated conclusions with  no  rational  basis
    when considering whether it was proportionate to deport the  Appellant.
    This assertion was made having regard to the fact there was family life
    between the Appellant and  another  step  child  Patrick.   The  fourth
    ground related to the general  assertion  that  the  Second  panel  had
    failed  to  consider  the  relevant  factors  which  impacted  on   the
    assessment of proportionality, including the fact  that  the  Appellant
    originally had a period of leave in the  United  Kingdom  during  which
    period all the three children had been born.  It was also asserted that
    the second panel had not put the seriousness of the sentencing  remarks
    in its proper context, namely an assertion that the  Appellant  was  "a
    small cog in a machine".

 3. The Respondent had filed a short Rule  24  response  arguing  that  the
    second panel had directed themselves appropriately.

 4.  After  hearing  detailed  oral  submissions  from  both  advocates  we
    reserved our decision which we now give with our reasons.

Discussion:

 5. Before considering the grounds in detail it is appropriate to  set  out
    some general background as  to  this  Appellant  and  his  partner  and
    children.  It is an agreed fact that the Appellant entered  the  United
    Kingdom in 1999 using a different identity, he claimed asylum,  he  was
    refused and removed to Lisbon in August 1999.  The Appellant  then  re-
    entered the United Kingdom using this identity  with  a  false  Angolan
    passport in June 2001.  Again, he claimed asylum, this was refused, and
    an appeal was lodged; but he abandoned his appeal  and  the  Respondent
    decided to grant him exceptional leave to remain on  12th  August  2002
    until 12th August 2006.  During this period of leave it is  correct  as
    is contended that the Appellant had three children.   The  first  being
    born on 7th February 2003, Suemidia with his  partner  Suzi  Sebastiao.
    On 29th September the Appellant's second daughter Faith was born to the
    same partner.  On  24th  April  2006  the  Appellant's  third  daughter
    Brianna was born with his current partner Linette Borges.

 6. During the period of exceptional leave the Appellant was  convicted  in
    April  2005  of  resisting   a   police   constable,   driving   whilst
    disqualified, and using a vehicle  whilst  uninsured,  and  received  a
    community rehabilitation order.  Later in the same  year  he  was  also
    convicted of two counts of using a  false  instrument  and  received  a
    fourteen month sentence.  The Appellant's  application  for  indefinite
    leave to remain, lodged towards  the  end  of  his  extant  leave,  was
    refused with the Respondent deciding to make  a  deportation  order  on
    28th August 2007.

 7.  That appeal came before a panel of the  then  Asylum  and  Immigration
    Tribunal, Immigration Judge Higgins and Dr J O de Barros, (  the  first
    panel) who in  a  determination  promulgated  on  12th  December  2007,
    following a hearing a week earlier, dismissed  the  appeal  both  under
    Immigration Rules and Human Rights (having regard to Article 8).

 8. The pre-sentence report referred to in  Grounds  of  Appeal  before  us
    related back to the appellant's relevant conviction, considered by  the
    first panel, of using a false instrument, and the terms of imprisonment
    to which he had  been  sentenced.   At  that  time  the  Appellant  was
    assessed of having a risk of reoffending as  medium,  although  it  was
    noted  that  his  offending  appeared  to  becoming  more  devious  and
    fraudulent.

 9. The Appellants position before the first panel in  2007  was  that  the
    Appellant and Ms Sebastiao had been estranged during his  period  prior
    to his remand in  custody.   They  were  however  living  in  the  same
    household with their two daughters  and  the  Appellant  was  regularly
    visiting Linette and his child Brianna in Leeds. Whilst  accepting  his
    evidence as to Ms Sebastiao, the first  panel  was  not  satisfied  the
    Appellant enjoyed family life with Brianna  and  Ms  Borges  in  Leeds.
    The first panel set out the reasons for that,  including  the  lack  of
    availability of funds to make regular visits from London to Leeds.  The
    first panel's conclusions in paragraph 35 of that decision was that his
    removal would not be an unreasonable interference  as  they  considered
    that Ms Sebastiao and their two daughters could have accompanied him to
    Angola. Their principal reasons for this were that Ms  Sebastiao,  also
    from Angola, had no current status in the United Kingdom, and  the  two
    children were then only aged 2 and  4.   Their  conclusion  as  to  his
    relationship with Brianna and Linette Borges was this:

          "Had we been satisfied, which we are  not,  that  the  Appellant's
         relationship with Brianna  constituted  family  life,  rather  than
         being just an element of the private life  he  has  established  in
         this  country  we  would  have  judged  the  interference  with  it
         proportionate for all the reasons we have given."

10. The Respondent did not act on the deportation decision because the Home
    Office were notified that he had an impending prosecution against  him.
    On 18th February 2011 the Appellant was convicted in  absentia  on  two
    counts  of  possession  of   a   controlled/false/improperly   obtained
    instrument and one  of  entering  into  an  arrangement  to  facilitate
    acquisition/retention/use/control of criminal property.  The sentencing
    judge, His Honour Judge Matheson QC, noted that before  his  trial  the
    Appellant had last been seen in May 2010.  His  co-defendant,  who  was
    present in court, was his partner Linette Borges.  In September 2011 he
    was arrested, and sentenced  to  a  term  of  21  months'  imprisonment
    concurrently on all three counts. As between the Appellant and Lynette,
    the judge described him as "very much more active, a prime mover":  she
    received a short suspended sentence, with an unpaid  work  requirement.
    Meanwhile the Appellant commenced his  term  of  imprisonment,  at  the
    conclusion of which he was placed in immigration detention.

11. It was the  Appellant's  position  before  the   panel,  against  whose
    decision this appeal lies that he was in a  relationship  with  Linette
    but his relationship with Suzi had "completely disintegrated and he was
    no longer seeing his two children  Suemidia and Faith".   He  contended
    that in November 2007 he had moved in with Linette's house  in  London.
    He also set out that he has three brothers in the United Kingdom,  that
    he wished to remain in the United Kingdom, where all  his  family  are,
    and that  he  had  close  relationships  with  the  children  and  step
    children.  His declared wish was to marry his partner Linette.

12. Having set out the general background we now turn to our  consideration
    of the detailed submissions expanding on the Grounds of Appeal and  our
    conclusions thereon.

13. The primary submission of  Counsel  was  that  the  first  ground  (the
    failure to consider the impact of his removal on Linette  and  her  two
    children, Patrick and Brianna),  the third ground (the  second  panel's
    conclusions on the best interests of his own three  children  Suemidia,
    Faith and Brianna) and the fourth ground (the failure to  consider  the
    fact that they had all been born while he had leave to be here, and the
    sentencing judge's remarks about the Appellant being "a small cog in  a
    large machine") all impacted on the  second  panel's  determination  on
    proportionality, and all had to be considered together, as  the  effect
    of the second panel's asserted errors  was a cumulative one.

14. We made clear during the course of  submissions  our  provisional  view
    that  the  second  ground,  relating  to  the   Appellant's   risk   of
    reoffending,  was  not  sustainable  having  regard  to  his   previous
    convictions , one of which had led to the previous  deportation  order.
    Miss Smith did not seek to challenge that view.

15. We note that the  panel's determination carefully sets out the position
    of the Appellant's  three  children  and  clearly  had  regard  to  the
    Respondent's duty to consider Section 55 of  the  Borders,  Citizenship
    and Immigration Act 2009, namely to consider the best interests of  the
    children.  The first Panel recognised that the children  were  innocent
    victims.  They noted that the child Brianna was a British citizen.  She
    was  living  with  her  mother  and  concluded  that  her  health   and
    development would not be affected by her father's removal.

16.  The Second panel did consider the position  of  Linette's  step  child
    Patrick, her oldest child Tatiana was  however  over  18  and  did  not
    receive detailed consideration.  We aresatisfied, given her  age,  that
    her best interests did not  require  specific  consideration;  nor  was
    there anything to show that her  general  article  8  rights  warranted
    further consideration.

17. Criticism was made in submissions that the judge had not  set  out  the
    substance of Linette's evidence.  That was not  a  specific  Ground  of
    Appeal and no request had been made for  a  transcript  of  the  second
    panel's notes.  However the  handwriting  being  moderately  clear  the
    relevant passage was read out by us.
Notes of Evidence taken from my Record of proceedings:

Witness- Lynette Burges

She adopted her witness statement .

Q-Has 3 children

 A- yes , Bryanna is 7 , other s are 2, 11 and 18 . Patrick is 11

   Q- Do you remember when you started living together with the appellant


   A- A-2007/2008- was near Christmas  time .   Bryanna was born .  She  was
      a year.  Live din Croydon 113 Curve? Road. Used to  live  in  Leeds  .
      Then moved to London.   I meet him in 2004  but moved down  to  London
      in 2007  and started  living together  as husband and wife .  We  have
      been in a relationship  9 years .  Lived together 6 years .   Just  me
      and kids lived in house.  He was father to children . He helped  me  .
      We worked as a team .  Children treat him like a dad  and he treat the
      kids like his children .
      I have been a single mom  now .  Not easy on my own .  Son now getting
      into trouble .  Children needs two parents  for it to work .   Bryanna
      thinks her dad is on a holiday .  She loves her dad .  Don't want  him
      to be removed .  Not coping well right now .  Hope it wont  happen.  I
      hope to attend  University  to do  business  ,  then   start  a  small
      business in food.  Get married and educate  children.   He  will  live
      with me.  He will not offend again .  Not acceptable .  he knows  what
      I have been through.  He wont engage in anything against the law
        Having read the statement of Linette,  and  after  considering  that
      note of  evidence,  although  we  would  not  seek  to   diminish  the
      difficulty a single mother faces in bringing up children it  is  clear
      that the Appellant can only have played a limited  part  in  Brianna's
      upbringing, given that, as recorded by the sentencing  judge  that  he
      absconded in May 2010 and was not  re-arrested  till  September  2011,
      since when he  had  been  in  detention  to  date.   Although  Counsel
      referred us to the authorities, including Sanade and  others  (British
      Children - Zambrano - Dereci) [2012] UKUT  00048  (IAC)  and  Omotunde
      (best interests - Zambrano applied - Razgar) Nigeria [2011] UKUT 00247
      (IAC) these were of course decisions prior to the  Court  of  Appeal's
      decision in MF (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 1192 .

18. We are satisfied that, bearing in mind that this was for  much  of  the
    time, and his  partner  Linette  is  now  effectively  a  single-parent
    family, there was nothing out of the ordinary in the position of any of
    the children,  for example a child being regarded as a child in need by
    the relevant local authority.  The second panel did recognise and  deal
    with the Appellant's step  child  Patrick's  ADHD,  and  took  it  into
    account as part of their overall decision.

  19. While Lynette spoke in her evidence of her reliance on  the  Appellant
      in helping to look after the children, there is nothing to  show  that
      she has not been coping, both while he had absconded between May  2010
      and September 2011, and since he has been in custody from then on.  We
      are satisfied therefore that there is no material error of law on  the
      first ground, that the second panel failed adequately to consider  the
      position of Linette . As requested by counsel we have also  considered
      that as part of an overall evaluation of whether there was an error of
      law by the  second  panel,  in  their  cumulative  assessment  of  the
      evidence.



20. The third ground of appeal is partly made out, it is asserted, as there
    were no  specific  grounds  for  the  second  panel's  conclusion  that
    Patrick's natural father would play an increased role in his life.   We
    are satisfied that the second panel's decision about  Patrick  on  that
    point: they said no more than that "... it may be  his  father  can  be
    encouraged to play more of a r�le  in  his  life",  and  took  it  into
    account no further than that. We are satisfied there was  no  error  in
    that approach. Their finding  that Patrick would remain living with his
    mother is not in dispute.  Overall, given the history of the  Appellant
    and Linette's family, we are satisfied that this does not demonstrate a
    material error of law.

21. The second panel's consideration of the welfare and their best interest
    is one where they clearly recognise the stark reality of  the  lack  of
    contact if the Appellant were to be deported. They have not  sought  to
    minimise that. That is very clear from their wording in  paragraph  99,
    where they describe it as "a consideration of  the  first  importance".
    We are satisfied the second panel did not take a simplistic view of the
    impact of the loss of a father on any of the children's  upbringing  in
    the United Kingdom.

22. The fourth ground of appeal, taking issue with the  general  assessment
    of proportionality, we are also satisfied has  no  substantial  weight,
    having regard to the underlying realities of this Appellant's position.
     The sentencing judge made it clear that the conduct for which  he  had
    to deal with him involved a pattern of  dishonesty  (3  counts  over  a
    period of time) where the value obtained was more than �20,000 and less
    than �100,000 in the sentencing decision,  leading  to  an  appropriate
    sentence of 21 months. This is a substantial offence involving  a  very
    clear public interest in the prevention of crime, and we are  satisfied
    both that the second panel  were  required  to  give  this  appropriate
    weight and indeed have done so.

23. On an overall assessment  of  this  appeal,  given  the  background  of
    earlier  offences,  and  the  earlier  deportation  decision,  and  the
    dismissal of the first  panel  of  his  appeal  against  that,  we  are
    satisfied that the second panel's decision was  one  properly  open  to
    them.

24. We are therefore satisfied there  was  no  material  error  of  law  in
    relation to any of the Grounds of Appeal.   We  therefore  dismiss  the
    appeal.

25. No application for an anonymity order was made.
