Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms F Allen, Counsel, instructed by CNA Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr P Nath, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant appeals against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge
    R L Walker (the judge), promulgated on  19  April  2017,  in  which  he
    dismissed the Appellant's appeal.   That  appeal  had  been  against  a
    decision of the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  dated  14  September  2015,
    refusing the  Appellant's  application  made  on  24  June  2015.   The
    application was in relation to  the  Appellant's  desire  to  join  her
    British citizen husband in the United Kingdom (the sponsor).  The Entry
    Clearance  Officer's  decision  disputed   the   genuineness   of   the
    relationship and stated that the financial requirements under  Appendix
    FM to the Rules had not been met.

    The judge's decision

 2. There was no Presenting Officer at the appeal  before  the  judge.   At
    paragraph 20 the judge found that the Appellant's relationship with the
    sponsor was genuine and subsisting.  At paragraph 23 he found that  the
    financial requirements under Appendix FM had in fact been  met.   There
    were no other substantive issues relating to  Appendix  FM  which  were
    live before the judge.  Notwithstanding this,  the  judge  went  on  in
    paragraphs 24 to 27 to consider the Article 8  claim  "outside  of  the
    Rules".  In so doing the judge concluded that recent  evidence  in  the
    form of a  set  of  accounts  produced  by  chartered  accountants  was
    "inconclusive and insufficient" to  prove  the  sponsor's  most  recent
    earnings.  On this basis the judge concluded that the Appellant  should
    make a fresh application and he therefore dismissed the appeal.

    The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

 3. The grounds of appeal are succinct.  They assert that  once  the  judge
    had concluded that the requirements of Appendix FM were met  he  should
    then have  allowed  the  appeal  on  Article  8  grounds.   Further  or
    alternatively,  the  judge  failed  to  provide  adequate  reasons  for
    rejecting the accountants' evidence of the sponsor's income,  and  that
    the judge had failed to make any findings in respect of  the  sponsor's
    own evidence on this point.

    The hearing before me

 4. Ms Allen relied on the grounds.  Mr Nath had nothing to add.

    Decision on error of law

 5. I conclude that the judge has materially erred in law.  My reasons  for
    this conclusion are as follows.

 6. It is clear from his findings that the judge  was  satisfied  that  all
    relevant requirements of Appendix FM had been met.  In particular,  the
    two matters raised in the Entry Clearance Officer's refusal were  found
    to be misconceived.  In relation  to  the  financial  requirements,  no
    issue had  been  taken  by  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer,  the  Entry
    Clearance Manager, or the judge  in  relation  to  any  other  specific
    requirements of Appendix FM-SE.  There was no Presenting Officer at the
    hearing and therefore no new additional  matters  were  raised  by  the
    Respondent at that stage.

 7. The Rules represent the Respondent's stated  policy  as  to  where  the
    balance lies between the public interest  on  the  one  hand,  and  the
    rights of individuals on the  other.   They  represent  in  effect  the
    Respondent's framework for the assessment of Article 8  claims  in  the
    first instance.  This framework carries with it significant  weight  of
    course, as confirmed in numerous decisions of the higher courts.  There
    has never been any suggestion from the Respondent that  anything  above
    and beyond satisfaction of the Rules was  required  in  order  for  the
    Appellant to succeed in her claim.  The application under  Appendix  FM
    was of course a human rights claim for the purposes  of  the  statutory
    appeal's framework within which the judge  was  himself  deciding  this
    case.  I conclude that once the  judge  had  found  that  all  relevant
    requirements of Appendix FM were met he should have gone  on  to  allow
    the appeal on this basis alone.

 8. In relation to ground 2, I agree that  the  judge  has  erred  in  this
    respect as well.  There is nothing to suggest that the judge deemed the
    accountants to be unreliable or that the set of accounts provided  were
    "fake" in any way.  There was no Presenting Officer to  challenge  this
    evidence at the hearing.  Those accounts clearly  showed  (having  seen
    the originals for myself) an annual profit of in excess of the  �18,600
    required by Appendix FM.  In my  view,  no  reasons,  or  at  least  no
    adequate reasons, had  been  provided  by  the  judge  to  justify  his
    conclusion that these accounts were "inconclusive and insufficient"  to
    prove on the balance of probabilities that the sponsor's profit was  as
    set out in this evidence.  In addition, I note that the sponsor himself
    had provided evidence confirming the  amount  of  his  income  and  its
    source.  The judge has failed to consider this evidence or at least has
    failed to make any findings thereon.  There is nothing to suggest  that
    the judge found the sponsor to  be  unreliable  as  a  witness  in  any
    material respect.  There is a further error here.

 9. In light of the above I set aside the judge's decision.

    Remaking the decision

10. Both representatives were agreed that I should go on  and  re-make  the
    decision in this case.  This I now do.

11. There has been no challenge by Mr Nath to any of the positive  findings
    made by the judge, neither has he challenged  the  reliability  of  the
    sponsor's evidence (contained in the witness statement and in the  form
    of the accounts) relating to his most recent  financial  circumstances.
    I find, as did the judge below, that all requirements  of  Appendix  FM
    have been met by the Appellant.  The marriage is  a  perfectly  genuine
    and subsisting  one.   Having  regard  to  the  evidence  as  a  whole,
    including the fact that no additional points  had  been  taken  by  the
    Entry Clearance Manager  or  the  Respondent  at  any  time  since  the
    original refusal, I find that the financial requirements under Appendix
    FM have also been met. In so finding I specifically conclude  that  all
    of the requirements of Appendix FM-SE have been satisfied.   There  has
    never been any issue  in  relation  to  accommodation  or  the  English
    language requirements, and I find that these have been met as well.

12. In respect of the sponsor's current financial circumstances,  I  accept
    as being reliable his own evidence as reliable, and the same applies to
    the accounts relating to the tax year April 2016 to April 2017.  I find
    that the minimum financial threshold of �18,600 has  been  exceeded  by
    the sponsor.

13. In view of the above, the Appellant's appeal is allowed  on  Article  8
    grounds.  First and foremost she succeeds because she has  met  all  of
    the  relevant  requirements  of  Appendix  FM.   That  in   itself   is
    sufficient.

14. In any event, the minimum income threshold of �18,600 is still exceeded
    by the sponsor's current income  and  this,  combined  with  all  other
    circumstances,  goes  to  show  that  the  Respondent's   decision   is
    disproportionate.  I have had regard  to  all  relevant  factors  under
    section 117B of the 2002  Act.   The  very  important  public  interest
    consideration is met by the fact that the Appellant has  satisfied  the
    requirements of the Rules and  as  of  now  still  meets  the  relevant
    minimum income  threshold.   There  are  no  adverse  English  language
    issues.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved material errors of law.

I therefore set it aside.

I  re-make  the  decision  by  allowing   the   Appellant's   appeal.    The
Respondent's refusal of the  Appellant's  human  rights  claim  is  unlawful
under Section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.

No anonymity direction is made.

TO THE RESPONDENT

FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make  a  whole  fee
award of �140.00. The Appellant has succeeded in her appeal and there is  no
good reason for me to reduce the fee award.
