Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr T Wilding, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    In person


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Although the Secretary of State is the appellant in these  proceedings,
    I continue to refer to the parties as they were before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of C�te d'Ivoire, born in 1986.  He  arrived
    in the UK on 1 September 1994, being a dependant on his father's asylum
    application.

 3. On 3 March 1998 his stepmother, a French  national,  made  a  residence
    permit application with the appellant's father and him  as  dependants.
    His father was granted indefinite leave to remain ("ILR") on 24  August
    1999 and the appellant was granted ILR outside the Rules in  line  with
    that of his father, on 24 November 1999.

 4. The appellant has been convicted of a number of criminal offences which
    are set out in the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Housego  ("the
    FtJ") in his decision promulgated on 15 September  2017.   In  summary,
    they are offences of burglary, possession of  weapons,  intimidating  a
    witness or juror, drug offences, including  supplying  class  A  drugs,
    failure to comply with  various  court  orders  and  culminating  in  a
    sentence of 16 months' imprisonment  imposed  in  the  Crown  Court  at
    Leicester on 21 March 2014 for bringing cannabis into prison.

 5. A decision to make a deportation order was  made  on  3  November  2014
    pursuant to the Immigration (European Economic Area)  Regulations  2006
    ("the EEA  Regulations").   Prior  to  that  he  had  been  subject  to
    deportation proceedings, having been first  notified  of  liability  to
    deportation on  7  February  2007.   In  relation  to  that  notice  of
    liability to deportation, the respondent  decided  not  to  pursue  the
    matter in the light of the sentence that was imposed for  the  offences
    at that time, being a  sentence  under  two  years'  imprisonment,  and
    taking into account the appellant's EU rights.

 6. On 1 June 2009 he was  again  notified  of  liability  for  deportation
    following conviction for supplying crack cocaine for which he  received
    a sentence of two  years'  imprisonment.   The  appellant  successfully
    appealed that decision, his appeal having been allowed  by  the  First-
    tier Tribunal ("FtT") on 28 April  2010.   The  appellant  was  however
    warned that deportation proceedings might be pursued in  the  event  of
    further offending.

 7. In relation to the decision dated 3 November 2014 to make a deportation
    order under the EEA Regulations, the appellant lodged notice of  appeal
    out of time on 2 April 2015.  The FtT refused to grant an extension  of
    time.

 8. A letter dated 26 January 2017 rejected human rights  submissions  made
    on behalf of the appellant, that letter being a decision to  refuse  to
    accept further submissions as amounting to a fresh claim (para  353  of
    the Rules). That decision  was  unsuccessfully  challenged  by  way  of
    judicial review.

 9. Further submissions were made and a decision dated 1  August  2017  was
    made, that being a decision to refuse a  protection  and  human  rights
    claim.  Within it was a decision to make a deportation  order  pursuant
    to the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016 ("the  EEA
    Regulations 2016").

10. After a hearing on 14 September 2017, the FtJ  allowed  the  appeal  on
    human rights grounds, with reference to Article 3.

    The FtJ's decision

11. The FtJ applied the decision in Paposhvili v Belgium, 13 December 2016,
    ECtHR (Application No. 41738/10)  in  relation  to  evidence  that  the
    appellant suffers from schizoaffective disorder.   He  found  that  the
    appellant came to the UK as a young child (stating that he was  aged  6
    years when he arrived, whereas he was in fact 8).  He said that all the
    appellant's immediate family are in the UK, as citizens of an EU  state
    or with ILR.  He found that the appellant has no connection  with  C�te
    d'Ivoire and that he does not speak French.  He  concluded  that  given
    his age, whatever French he had learnt as a child, had faded.  He  also
    found that the appellant had two children in the UK with whom he  would
    like to have a relationship, and there is a connection with them.

12. He referred to the appellant's immigration  history  and  his  criminal
    offending.  In relation to the appeal in 2010, he said that the factors
    that were evident at that stage, namely his age when he came to the UK,
    the length of time he had lived legally in the UK, his complete lack of
    the language and knowledge of the culture of  C�te  d'Ivoire,  and  the
    apparent absence of any family members there, were  all  factors  still
    present, and even more so seven years further on.  He had been  in  the
    UK for 23 years.

13. He referred to the appellant having sought help for his  mental  health
    problems for the first time when he was in prison in 2014  serving  his
    last sentence.  He referred to his being troubled by  voices  that  are
    both internal and external and are malevolent.  Those voices, he  said,
    had led the appellant to  use  excess  alcohol  and  illicit  drugs  to
    attempt to drown them out, to the extent that he was drinking  a  litre
    of rum a day at one point.  He found credible the assertion  that  this
    downward spiral led to his offending.

14. At [32] he said that whilst  in  prison  the  appellant  had  made  two
    serious attempts at suicide and has self harmed.  He referred to prison
    medical records giving the details of those attempts.   There  were  74
    pages of notes from the prison  medical  service  in  relation  to  his
    symptoms and the treatment he had received,  as  well  as  evidence  of
    suicidal ideation.  He referred to prison notes dated 31  January  2017
    showing that the appellant had claimed to  be  abstinent  from  alcohol
    after his release in July 2015 until detained under immigration  powers
    in 2017.

15. Referring to the appellant's release from prison in July  2015  at  the
    end of his sentence, he  said  that  he  complied  with  conditions  of
    tagging and reporting until detained on  reporting.   During  those  16
    months he said that the appellant was not in trouble  with  the  police
    and was not charged with any offence.

16. He concluded at  [35]  that  without  proper  psychiatric  support  the
    appellant was likely to regress, and  it  was  plain  that  strain  and
    stress made his condition worse.

17. He referred to various European  and  domestic  authorities  on  health
    cases, as well as the decision in Paposhvili.

18. At [37] he concluded that the appellant would have no personal  support
    in C�te d'Ivoire, and that his family might send money does  not  alter
    that fact.  He referred  to  what  he  described  as  generic  evidence
    provided by the respondent that there were mental  health  services  in
    C�te d'Ivoire.  He then concluded that  having  regard  to  the  prison
    medical records and two serious attempts at suicide in prison,  he  was
    satisfied that without effective  medical  help,  both  medication  and
    expert oversight, the appellant was likely to commit suicide.

19. He then stated that that passed responsibility to the  Home  Office  to
    show that he would receive help, but that had not been done.  He  found
    that generic information about the availability of  treatment  in  C�te
    d'Ivoire was not enough in this case where the death of  the  appellant
    was not only possible but likely if he did not receive the help that he
    gets in the UK.

20. He then referred to the evidence relied on by the respondent  in  terms
    of treatment for mental health conditions in C�te d'Ivoire.

21. At [40] he said the following:

         "This is all  very  well  and  good  as  generic  observation,  but
         completely inadequate in the case of the appellant.   First  it  is
         hearsay, and does not give its sources.  Given the stakes here, one
         would expect to know who was saying the treatment  and  drugs  were
         available.  Secondly, is [risperidone] essential for the appellant?
          Are the other drugs named an adequate  substitute  for  him?   How
         would he access the treatment?  How do I know he is  going  to  get
         any help there?  If this appellant is to be deported then any judge
         hearing such an appeal is going to need to be sure that he - as  an
         individual - is going to have a care plan  that  will  deliver  the
         care he needs to ensure his safety.  Without that knowing that such
         care is available to him [sic] there is  an  unacceptable  risk  of
         suicide."

22. In relation to the asylum ground of  appeal  (risk  of  persecution  as
    someone treated as being bewitched) he  dismissed  the  appeal  stating
    that if the appellant was properly treated he  would  function  without
    being regarded as being bewitched.  If he is not so  treated,  then  he
    succeeded under Article 3, he said.  He said that further, there was no
    evidence that his treatment would be worse than societal discrimination
    short of persecution.

23. In relation to Article  8,  at  [43]  he  said  that  the  respondent's
    decision considered Article 8, but he  said  that  he  noted  that  the
    appellant has unsuccessfully challenged the deportation order, when the
    Article 8 factors will have been considered.  He said that he was aware
    of no significant difference between  now  and  the  dismissal  of  the
    challenge to the deportation order.  Amongst other things, he said that
    there was insufficient evidence  "as  to  Article  8  reasons  for  the
    appellant", and the burden of proof was on  him.   He  found  that  the
    Article 8 claim could not succeed on the basis of the  evidence  before
    him.

    The grounds and submissions

24. The respondent's grounds contend that the FtJ's decision  allowing  the
    appeal under Article 3 was in error.  The domestic authorities are  not
    such as to indicate that the appellant could meet the high threshold to
    succeed on Article 3 grounds.  The FtJ's  reliance  on  Paposhvili  was
    erroneous.

25. Furthermore, it is  argued  that  the  FtJ's  conclusion  that  medical
    treatment was not available, was wrong in that the FtJ was "obliged" to
    accept the respondent's objective evidence that medical  treatment  was
    available, unless expert evidence was produced to rebut this.  However,
    Mr Wilding accepted that that contention in the grounds went too far.

26. In terms of the risk of suicide, it is argued in the grounds  that  the
    FtJ ought to have made his decision with reference to J v Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department [2005] EWCA Civ 629.  The FtJ not  having
    referred to that decision and the approach required  in  assessing  the
    risk of suicide, the decision was not adequately reasoned.

27. It is also  asserted  that  the  FtJ's  conclusion  at  [37]  that  the
    appellant  would  have  no  personal  support  on  return,  appears  to
    contradict [22] of his decision, albeit that the latter  paragraph  was
    unclear.

28. In submissions, Mr Wilding relied on the decision in EA & Ors  (Article
    3 medical cases - Paposhvili not applicable) [2017] UKUT 00445 (IAC).

29. It was submitted that the FtJ's decision was  not  clear  in  terms  of
    whether he found that there was a suicide risk on return or a breach of
    Article 3 otherwise.  The  FtJ  had  in  any  event  not  followed  the
    structured approach set out in J.  He had asked the wrong question  and
    applied the wrong  test,  not  having  assessed  whether  there  was  a
    complete absence of any treatment which would result in  an  Article  3
    breach on return.

30. Furthermore, there was no burden on the Secretary of State to establish
    that the appellant's return would not breach Article 3.

31. The respondent's decision had referred to evidence  of  in-patient  and
    out-patient treatment, at least in Abidjan.  There was also information
    in the response to the Country of Origin information request about  the
    availability of anti-psychotics.  The FtJ had set out that evidence  at
    [39] and in the following paragraph he had asked a number of  questions
    but not made findings.

32. Up to [38] of his decision it would seem that the FtJ  was  considering
    the case as an Article 3 medical case but thereafter he went on to deal
    with it as an Article 3 suicide case.  It was further unclear from  the
    FtJ's decision as to why he concluded that the appellant would  not  be
    able to take advantage of the treatment  and  medication  available  in
    C�te d'Ivoire.  The questions that the FtJ asked at [40] are  questions
    that could have been asked of the Secretary of State.   Some  of  those
    questions could be answered.

33. In reply, the appellant told me that he does not know  anyone  in  C�te
    d'Ivoire.  His stepmother had come back from there a couple  of  months
    ago, whilst he was in detention.  She is an NHS nurse and she told  his
    father that he would struggle to  get  treatment  there.   Because  his
    illness means that he talks to himself, and  it  is  a  very  spiritual
    country, they would do rituals on him as if he  were  possessed.   That
    would put him at risk of harm.

34. He also said that he does not speak the  language  and  does  not  know
    where he would live.  His stepmother had gone just to see  or  research
    the facilities there.

35. The medication he is receiving is  venlafaxine  and  aripiprazole.   He
    sees his GP, but he was given that medication on release from prison.

36. He has two children, aged 5 and 1, and  a  partner  who  is  a  British
    citizen.

37. He also said that if he relapses he  has  thoughts  of  doing  harm  to
    himself which  he  is  unable  to  control.   That  is  what  he  needs
    medication for.  He could not get  it  back  home.   Right  now  he  is
    content because he can focus on his children.

38. Mr Wilding said that neither Article 8 nor the EEA  decision  had  been
    considered by the FtJ (although actually Article 8 was considered-up to
    a point).  It was submitted that if an error of law was found requiring
    the decision to be set aside, it was appropriate for the appeal  to  be
    remitted to the First-tier Tribunal.

    Assessment

39. It is not necessary to deal with all the arguments advanced  on  behalf
    of the Secretary of State because in relation to the  main  aspects  of
    the complaints in relation to the decision of the FtJ, I  am  satisfied
    that there is merit in them.

40. The FtJ decided  the  appeal  with  an  emphasis  on  the  decision  in
    Paposhvili, as is clear from various paragraphs of his decision  beyond
    the extensive citation of  extracts  of  the  decision  at  [11],  with
    emphasis indicated in relation to various aspects of it.   However,  as
    is clear from EA & Ors the ECtHR departed from the clear and consistent
    case law that it identified in its own decision, in  stating  at  [181]
    that:

         "The Court concludes from this recapitulation of the case-law  that
         the application of Article 3 of the Convention only in cases  where
         the person facing expulsion is close to death, which has  been  its
         practice since the judgment  in  N.  v.  the  United  Kingdom,  has
         deprived aliens who are seriously ill but whose condition  is  less
         critical, of the benefit of that provision".

41. It was decided in EA & Ors that the  decision  in  Paposhvili,  is  not
    consistent with United Kingdom domestic law.  The Tribunal concluded at
    [31] that it was not permissible for the Tribunal to  depart  from  the
    domestic authorities it cited.  Thus, in that paragraph,  the  Tribunal
    said that:


         "It is not  permissible  for  the  Tribunal  to  depart  from  this
         authority and, in particular, cannot do so  by  reliance  upon  the
         Paposhvili enlargement set out in  paragraph  183  of  the  ECtHR's
         judgment (see paragraph 6 above).  Hence, the recasting of  Article
         3 to include 'situations involving the removal of a  seriously  ill
         person in which substantial grounds have been shown  for  believing
         that he or she, although not at imminent risk of dying, would  face
         a real risk, on account of the absence of appropriate treatment  in
         the receiving country or the lack of access to such  treatment,  of
         being exposed to a serious, rapid and irreversible decline  in  his
         or her state of health resulting  in  intense  suffering  or  to  a
         significant reduction in life expectancy' is  not  part  of  United
         Kingdom domestic law."

42. Having considered the decision in EA & Ors with care, I agree with  its
    reasoning and adopt it.

43. In these circumstances, whilst it is understandable that the FtJ relied
    on the decision in Paposhvili in the way that he did,  I  am  satisfied
    that in doing so he erred in law.

44. In addition, in concluding that the appellant's return would result  in
    "an unacceptable risk of suicide", I am also satisfied that he erred in
    law.  This is because he did not make that assessment with reference to
    the approach indicated in the decision in J.  In that case,  the  Court
    of Appeal identified how the risk of suicide was to  be  assessed.   It
    said as follows:

         "26.     First, the test requires an assessment to be made  of  the
             severity of the treatment which it is said that the  applicant
             would suffer if removed.  This must attain a minimum level  of
             severity.  The court has said on a number  of  occasions  that
             the  assessment  of  its   severity   depends   on   all   the
             circumstances  of  the  case.   But  the  ill-treatment   must
             "necessarily be serious"  such  that  it  is  "an  affront  to
             fundamental humanitarian principles to remove an individual to
             a country where he is at risk of serious  ill-treatment":  see
             Ullah paras [38-39].

         27.      Secondly, a causal link must be shown to exist between the
             act or threatened act of removal or expulsion and the  inhuman
             treatment relied on as violating  the  applicant's  article  3
             rights.  Thus in Soering at para [91], the court said:

                  "In so far as any liability under the Convention is or may
                  be incurred, it is liability incurred by  the  extraditing
                  Contracting State by reason of  its  having  taken  action
                  which has as a  direct  consequence  the  exposure  of  an
                  individual to proscribed ill-treatment." (emphasis added).

             See also para [108] of Vilvarajah where the  court  said  that
             the examination of the article 3  issue  "must  focus  on  the
             foreseeable consequences of the removal of the  applicants  to
             Sri Lanka..."

         28.      Thirdly, in the context of a foreign case, the  article  3
             threshold is particularly high simply because it is a  foreign
             case.  And  it  is  even  higher  where  the  alleged  inhuman
             treatment is not the direct or indirect responsibility of  the
             public authorities of the receiving state,  but  results  from
             some naturally occurring illness, whether physical or  mental.
             This is made clear in para [49] of D and para [40] of Bensaid.

         29.      Fourthly, an article 3 claim can in principle succeed in a
             suicide case (para [37] of Bensaid).

         30.      Fifthly, in deciding whether there is a  real  risk  of  a
             breach  of  article  3  in  a  suicide  case,  a  question  of
             importance is whether the applicant's fear of ill-treatment in
             the receiving state upon which the risk of suicide is said  to
             be based is objectively well-founded.  If the fear is not well-
             founded, that will tend to weigh against there  being  a  real
             risk that the removal will be in breach of article 3.

         31.      Sixthly, a further question of considerable  relevance  is
             whether the removing and/or the receiving state has  effective
             mechanisms to  reduce  the  risk  of  suicide.  If  there  are
             effective mechanisms, that too will weigh heavily  against  an
             applicant's claim that removal will violate his or her article
             3 rights."

45. The failure of the FtJ to apply the approach set out in J is a  further
    error of law which requires the decision to be set aside.

46. Furthermore, although the FtJ said at [40] that the  information  about
    the availability of treatment in C�te d'Ivoire in the Country of Origin
    information request is hearsay and does  not  give  its  sources,  that
    conclusion fails to take into account the footnote to the  COI  request
    which explains the sources of the information.   Secondly,  it  is  not
    clear as to whether the FtJ was concluding that because the information
    was not first-hand,  it  was  not  admissible,  or  whether  it  simply
    affected the weight to be attributed to that  evidence.   Likewise,  in
    posing the several questions that he did at [40], it appears  that  the
    FtJ was suggesting that it was for the Secretary of State to  establish
    that there would not be a  breach  of  Article  3  on  the  appellant's
    return, whereas it is for the appellant to establish that there  would.



47. It does also seem to me that at [37],  where  the  FtJ  said  that  the
    appellant would have no personal support in C�te d'Ivoire, he failed to
    take into account the evidence recorded at [22] to the effect that  the
    appellant's partner had said, according to the appellant,  that  should
    would join him in C�te d'Ivoire.  Having said that,  that  alone  would
    not have led me to conclude that the FtJ had erred in law  such  as  to
    require the decision to be set aside.

48. In the light of the matters I have referred to which  in  my  judgement
    reveal errors of law in the FtJ's decision, and having  concluded  that
    his decision must be set aside, I consider that the appropriate  course
    is for the appeal to be remitted  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  a
    hearing de novo.  That is in accordance  with  the  Senior  President's
    Practice Statement at paragraph 7.2, given  the  extent  of  the  fact-
    finding exercise which needs to be undertaken.

49. As Mr Wilding quite properly suggested, the fresh hearing will have  to
    consider the deportation decision under the EEA Regulations as well  as
    Article 8.

    Decision

50. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    on a point of law.  Its decision is set aside and the  appeal  remitted
    to the First-tier Tribunal for a hearing de novo before a  judge  other
    than First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Housego,  with  no  findings  of  fact
    preserved except as agreed between the parties.
