Representation:

For the appellant:     Mr A Slatter, instructed by Ash Norton Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr S Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Dhavalkumar Narendrabhai Patel, date of  birth  13.9.86,
    is a citizen of India.

 2. This is his appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Omotosho promulgated 2.9.14, dismissing his  appeal  against  the
    decisions of the respondent, dated 10.9.13, to refuse  his  application
    to vary leave to remain in  the  UK  as  the  partner  of  Mrs  Prinkal
    Dhavalkumar Patel, and to remove him from the UK pursuant to section 47
    of the Immigration Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.   The  Judge  heard
    the appeal on 4.8.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Hollingworth granted permission to appeal  on
    20.10.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 10.12.14 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Omotosho should be set aside.

 6. The relevant and unusual background to the appeal can be summarised  as
    follows. The appellant came to the UK as a student in 2009, with  leave
    later extended to 30.3.12. During that time he returned  to  India  and
    married Mrs Patel in December 2010. She came to the UK on 31.12.11, not
    as his dependant, but as a student in her own right, with  leave  which
    at the time of the First-tier Tribunal hearing was  due  to  expire  on
    30.10.14. She now has further leave to remain under Tier  2,  but  that
    was not the situation prevailing at the date  of  the  hearing  in  the
    First-tier Tribunal, even though it was foreshadowed by what is set out
    at ï¿½24 of the decision.

 7. The appellant was refused  further  leave  to  remain  beyond  2012  to
    complete his studies, but in a decision  promulgated  on  9.10.12,  his
    appeal was allowed on the basis of article  8  ECHR  and  thus  he  was
    granted leave to expire 23.8.13.  He apparently completed  his  studies
    in August. The day before the expiry of that leave the  appellant  made
    an application for leave to remain outside the Rules on  the  basis  of
    being the partner of Mrs Patel. The refusal of that application and the
    decision to remove him was the subject of the appeal before the  First-
    tier Tribunal on 4.8.14. Curiously, although his wife had Tier 2  leave
    to remain, the appellant did not apply for coextensive leave to  remain
    as her  dependant.  At  the  First-tier  Tribunal  appeal  hearing  the
    appellant sought only to remain as long as  his  wife,  which  at  that
    stage was to 30.10.14.

 8. It was clear that the appellant could not meet the Rules for  leave  to
    remain under Appendix FM or paragraph 27ADE. The  Judge  very  properly
    considered the current case law including  Gulshan  (Article  8  -  new
    Rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT 640 (IAC), and  more  recently  R
    (oao MM and Other) v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 985, to conclude that on  the
    facts of this case she ought to  go  on  to  consider  the  appellant's
    circumstances outside the Immigration Rules. Having  done  so,including
    taking into account section 117B, Judge Omotosho dismissed the  appeal,
    relying on Nasim & Others (Article  8)  [2014]  UKUT  00025  (IAC),  in
    relation to the private life claim of the appellant.

 9. It is clear that amongst other considerations  in  the  proportionality
    balancing  exercise,  the  Judge's  attention  was  drawn  and  careful
    consideration given to the  claim  that  the  appellant's  wife  had  a
    medical condition which required her  husband's  support.  She  suffers
    from polycystic ovary problems, causing stomach and back pains. She  is
    sometimes unable to go to work for  some  5  days  during  her  monthly
    period cycle. The exact length of time she is incapacitated was unclear
    from the decision, but was not enough to prevent her holding down full-
    time employment as a carer, quite a physically demanding job. The judge
    also took into account the assertion that the nearest  family  to  help
    her in the appellant's absence was 1-1.5 hours away.

10. The judge accepted that the appellant and his wife are in a genuine and
    subsisting relationship. However, her leave in the UK was limited to no
    more than a couple of months following the appeal hearing in the First-
    tier Tribunal, due to expire on 30.10.14 and  there  was  no  basis  to
    speculate at that time whether it might be extended further. There  was
    no pending application. It is relevant that it was apparently  open  to
    the appellant to apply for leave to remain as her dependant, but he did
    not do so. Neither has he applied as such with or on the  back  of  his
    wife's recent application, now granted for further leave to remain. The
    judge could only assess the circumstances at the date of the hearing on
    the basis that the appellant had completed his studies and his wife was
    due to complete her studies and leave by 30.10.14.

11. In  granting  permission  to  appeal,  Judge  Hollingworth  found,  "an
    arguable error of law has arisen  in  relation  to  the  scope  of  the
    judge's  consideration  of  the  medical  evidence  in   reaching   the
    conclusions  relevant  to  the  carrying  out  of  the  proportionality
    exercise. Arguably good grounds were found to have  been  made  out  in
    relation to proceeding to consider the application of article 8."

12. I confess I do not understand the grant of permission; it is clear that
    the judge did go on to make a full article 8  ECHR  assessment  outside
    the Immigration Rules.  In  that  assessment  the  judge  gave  careful
    consideration  to  the  spouse's  medical  condition  as  part  of  the
    proportionality assessment. However, it has to be borne  in  mind  that
    neither the appellant nor  his  wife  could  have  had  any  legitimate
    expectation of being able to remain in the UK except in compliance with
    immigration rules. As Nasim makes clear, there is no right to study  or
    work in the UK. A decision refusing to extend the leave of a student or
    former student does not engage article 8 private life, as it  does  not
    interfere with the  physical  or  moral  integrity  of  the  appellant.
    Article 8 is not designed to create such a right. There may well be  an
    interference with their rights to family life by removing the appellant
    pending the termination of his wife's studies and expiry of her  leave,
    creating a period of separation of a few weeks.

13. On the basis that article 8 is engaged, the judge went  on  to  conduct
    the careful proportionality balancing exercise between on the one  hand
    the rights of the appellant and his spouse to respect for their private
    and family life and on the other the legitimate and  necessary  aim  of
    the state  to  protect  the  economic  well-being  of  the  UK  through
    immigration control, which is in effect the public interest.

14. Whilst he disagrees with the judge's conclusion on that proportionality
    assessment, Mr Slatter was unable to point to any relevant factor  that
    had been left out of account or which should not have been  taken  into
    account. The matter of weight to be accorded to those factors  was  the
    task of the judge.  Unless  the  appellant  can  demonstrate  that  the
    evidence or circumstances were such that no judge  could  have  reached
    the same conclusion, or put another way that the circumstances  allowed
    of only a conclusion that the appeal should be allowed, the grounds are
    no more than a disagreement with the judge's decision on matters  which
    were for her to decide and for which conclusions she has  given  cogent
    reasons. Another judge may have reached  a  different  conclusion,  but
    that does not mean that the conclusion reached by  this  judge  was  an
    error of law so as to require the decision to be  set  aside  and  made
    again. There is nothing before me to show that the decision was in  any
    way perverse.

15. Each case must, of course, be considered on its own facts. However, the
    fact that she has strong period pains or perhaps worse for a  few  days
    each month and has the benefit of her husband to help her  during  that
    time, as he has no work or study to go to does not  necessarily  render
    his removal from the UK disproportionate. It is  not  for  me  at  this
    stage to replace the judge's views  with  my  own.  In  Akhalu  (health
    claim; ECHR Article 8) [2013] UKUT 00400 (IAC), the Upper Tribunal held
    that, "the consequences of removal for the health  of  a  claimant  who
    would not be able to access equivalent health care in their country  of
    nationality as was available in this country are  plainly  relevant  to
    the question of proportionality. But, when weighed against  the  public
    interest in ensuring that  the  limited  resources  of  this  country's
    health service are used to the best effect for the benefit of those for
    whom they are intended, theose consequences do not weigh heavily in the
    claimant's favour but speak cogently in support of the public interests
    in removal."

16. The health issue is relevant to proportionality, although in  a  rather
    different way to that in Akhalu.  At ï¿½45 the  Tribunal  held  that  the
    correct approach was for the judge to have regard to  every  aspect  of
    the claimant's private life here, as well as the consequences  for  her
    health of removal.  I am satisfied that the judge did  have  regard  to
    every aspect of the private and  family  life  in  the  proportionality
    balancing exercise. She considered all the relevant  facts  around  the
    health issue and grappled with it in the decision,  citing  appropriate
    and cogent reasons, particularly at ï¿½47, for reaching her conclusion. I
    cannot see that that decision was perverse or otherwise one not open to
    the judge to make.

17. I would further note that the appellant did  not  meet  the  Rules  for
    leave to remain as a partner on the basis  of  private  and  or  family
    life. Article 8 is not a shortcut to compliance with the Rules  and  he
    is not entitled to settle in the UK simply because that is his  choice.
    It may at first blush seem strange that a man should be separated  from
    his wife. However, it has to be recalled that  the  appellant  and  his
    wife have separately come to the UK as students; neither  came  as  the
    dependant of the other. Their purpose and their  leave  was  to  remain
    until studies were complete and only in compliance with the rules. They
    must be taken to have no legitimate expectation  to  remain  except  in
    accordance with immigration rules and to have intended to leave the  UK
    on completion of their studies. If the appellant, who is unemployed and
    no longer a student, wished to remain as his wife's dependant,  it  was
    open to him to make the appropriate application;  which  may  still  be
    open to him. However, he can hardly complain that he is asked to  leave
    when his studies are complete and he has no other basis to  remain,  at
    least in relation to any application he has made. The judge  took  into
    account not only the wife's medical condition but that there would be a
    short period of separation before she too would have had to  leave  the
    UK. In the circumstances, it can hardly be disproportionate  to  refuse
    him leave to remain.

Conclusions:

18. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed on all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules  2005.  Given  the  circumstances,  I
make no anonymity order.

Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
