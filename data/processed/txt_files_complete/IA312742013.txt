                            DETERMINATION REASONS

The Background to this Appeal

 1. On 9th February 2012 the respondent applied for leave to remain  as  on
    Article 8 grounds arising from family and private life  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  By a decision dated 22nd July 2013 the appellant refused that
    application and issued notice of an immigration decision to remove  the
    respondent to Jamaica.  The respondent appealed  and  her  appeal  came
    before the First-tier  Tribunal  on  3rd  June  2014  whereupon,  in  a
    determination promulgated on 20th June 2014, First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    C M Philips allowed the appeal.

 2. The appellant sought permission to  appeal  under  Article  8  and  the
    grounds are in the following terms:

         "The judge erred in law, by failing to accord  due  weight  to  the
         appellant's criminal conviction.

         1.   The judge at [30] held that

             "I attach weight to the fact that despite  the  disclosure  of
             her  conviction  in  her  long   residence   application   the
             appellant's extent tearful leave was not curtailed.  The  fact
             that the respondent did not  curtail  believe  undermines  the
             respondents refusal of her current application insofar as this
             is based upon the assertion that the appellant's  presence  in
             the UK is not conducive to the public good.

             At [32] it was held that there was

             "an inconsistency in the respondents approach between  on  the
             one hand not curtailing the appellants  extant  leave  on  the
             basis of her conviction but on the other hand refusing a later
             application for leave to remain outside the immigration  rules
             on the basis of family and private life because her conviction
             makes it undesirable to allow the appellant to remain  in  the
             United Kingdom".

         2.   The extant leave was as a Tier  4  student.   That  leave  was
             conferred for a specific purpose, and for a limited time.   It
             is therefore qualitatively different to a grant of  indefinite
             leave to remain, or to limited leave to remain on a  route  to
             settlement.  Different considerations can properly be said  to
             apply.   Where  a  migrant  is  settled,  or  on  a  path   to
             settlement, that migrant is likely to remain  in  the  UK  for
             longer, accrue strong rights to  remain  based  on  family  or
             private life, and be subject to less stringent monitoring.  It
             is  therefore  quite  rational  for  the  respondent,  in  her
             discretion, not to curtail the extent leave as a student;  but
             rather to decline to award a  further,  longer-term  grant  of
             leave.

         3.   There exists a strong public interest in (a) removing from the
             UK those who  commit  criminal  offences,  and  (b)  deterring
             migrants in  the  UK  from  committing  such  offences.   Lord
             Bingham in Huang [2007] UKHL 11 at [16] notes that

               "There  will,  in  almost  any  case,  be  certain   general
             considerations to bear in  mind:  the  general  administrative
             desirability  of  applying  known  rules  if   a   system   of
             immigration control is to be workable, predictable, consistent
             and fair as between one applicant and another; the  damage  to
             good administration and  effective  control  if  a  system  is
             perceived by applicants internationally to be  unduly  porous,
             unpredictable or perfunctory;  the  need  to  discourage  non-
             nationals admitted to the country temporarily  from  believing
             that they  can  commit  serious  crimes  and  yet  allowed  to
             remain..."

         4.   Moreover, the Rules pre July 2012 required consideration of an
             appellant's criminal record.  The former  Para  276B  provided
             that:

             276B:    the requirements  to  be  met  by  an  applicant  for
                    indefinite  leave  to  remain  on  the  ground  of  long
                    residence in the United Kingdom are that:

                    (i)     [she  has  had  10   years   continuous   lawful
                        residence, or 14 years continuous residence, and]

                    (ii)   having regard to the public interest there are no
                        reasons why it would be undesirable for him  to  be
                        given in definite leave to remain on the ground  of
                        long residence, taking into account his:

                             [...]

                             (c)    personal history,  including  character,
                             conduct, associations and  employment  records;
                             and

                             [...]

                             (e)    previous criminal record and the  nature
                             of any offence of which  the  person  has  been
                             convicted. .."

         5.   The requirements of the Rules are a relevant consideration  in
             any proper proportionality evaluation.

         6.   Accordingly, the judge erred in law by failing to  accord  due
             weight to the Appellant's criminal conviction.

         II.  The judge erred in law by applying the reasoning in  Chikwamba
             [2008] UKHL 40 to the current case.

         7.   At [41] the judge held that "because there is nothing pointing
             to the fact that an application for entry clearance  would  be
             refused, including nothing in the general grounds guidance  to
             indicate  the  appellant's  conviction  would  be  a  relevant
             consideration then Chikwamba applies.  I have attached weights
             not only to Chikwamba but also to all these other factors."

         8.   The judge erred in so holding.  Para S-EC 1.1 states that

              "The applicant will be refused entry clearance on grounds  of
             suitability if any of paragraphs S-EC.1.2 to 1.8 apply."

             S-EC 1.5 describes the Appellant's situation:

             The exclusion of the applicant from the UK is conducive to the
             public good because,  for  example,  the  applicant's  conduct
             (including convictions which do not fall within  paragraph  S-
             EC.1.4.), character, associations, or other reasons,  make  it
             undesirable to grant them entry clearance.

         9.    S-EC  1.5  in  Appendix  FM  therefore  suggests   that   the
             appellant's conviction would be a relevant consideration  that
             could properly lead to an ECO refusing  any  subsequent  entry
             clearance application from the appellant.  The judge erred  in
             law by holding otherwise.

         Accordingly, the Respondent seeks leave to appeal."

 3. By a decision dated 6th November 2014 First-tier Tribunal Judge  Parkes
    granted permission  to  appeal  and  the  substance  of  the  grant  of
    permission is in the following terms:

         "The grounds argue that the Judge erred in failing  to  attach  due
         weight  to  the  Appellant's   criminal   conviction,   misapplying
         paragraph 276B and erring in respect of  Chikwamba.   There  is  no
         reference to paragraph 400 of the Immigration Rules which  requires
         article 8 decisions to be decided with reference to Appendix FM and
         paragraph 276ADE."

 4. Thus the matter came before me. Ms Holmes relied upon the grounds.  The
    grounds speak for themselves.  They criticise the judge for not  having
    placed due weight on the conviction.  They criticise the judge for  not
    taking into account the context of the decision made and the  different
    statutory framework in place at the time of the conviction.  Ms  Holmes
    submitted that the judge  should  have  made  more  of  the  conviction
    bearing in mind that at the time the  decision  was  made  Ms  McIntosh
    could not succeed under the Immigration Rules.  The final aspect of the
    grounds takes issue with the judge's application of  Chikwamba  a  very
    different case on its facts.  The judge failed to take into account the
    relevant paragraphs of Appendix FM and Ms  Holmes  submitted  that  the
    judge erred in law and the decision should be set aside.

 5. Mr Subramanian relied upon his skeleton argument.  In relation  to  the
    points made by Ms Holmes the appeal was heard  in  June  2014  but  the
    application was made in February 2012 when the  new  immigration  rules
    had not yet come into effect.  The judge was quite correct to carry out
    an old style Article  8  balancing  exercise  because  the  new  public
    interest immigration rules had not come into force.

 6. Contrary to Ms Holmes's submission and what is set out in  the  grounds
    the judge had taken into consideration the conviction which is referred
    to at paragraph 38 and also at paragraph 42.  He  had  details  of  the
    offence before him which are set out at paragraph 19.

 7. The judge properly considered Article 8 and  carried  out  a  balancing
    exercise on proportionality and made findings that were  open  to  him.
    Mr Subramanian asked that the determination be upheld.

 8. It is clear from the determination that the appellant's  representative
    accepted in submissions that the decision that is the subject of appeal
    had been made under the wrong immigration rules insofar as it was based
    upon Appendix FM and paragraph 276ADE.  The application was made on 9th
    February 2012 and in line with the traditional provisions the  post-9th
    July 2012 immigration rules were not applicable to  the  appeal  before
    the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge.   The  only  issue  before  him   for
    determination was proportionality under Article 8 and the relevant date
    for assessing proportionality was the date of hearing.

 9. The judge dealt at length at paragraph 38  of  the  decision  with  the
    appellant's offence in the following way:

         "The seriousness of the offence is reflected in the fact  that  the
         appellant received a community order  to  carry  out  60  hours  of
         unpaid work and make restitution amounting to �50.   The  appellant
         has been in the United Kingdom lawfully on  short-term  visas  from
         2010 and but for her conviction she would  have  been  entitled  to
         indefinite leave to remain under  the  Immigration  Rules,  on  the
         basis of long residence.  As at the date of the  hearing  over  two
         and a half years had elapsed since the date  of  conviction.   Over
         two years of this period has been spent awaiting a decision on  her
         application.  The appellant has not committed any further  offences
         and her conduct since the offence appears to have  been  exemplary.
         The appellant is a Jamaican national.   Her  partner  is  a  United
         Kingdom citizen.  The appellant and her  partner  have  been  in  a
         relationship akin to marriage sine  2010.   Their  family  life  is
         effective as is evidenced by the financial, practical and emotional
         support that the relationship provides.  The  witness  knows  about
         the offence.  This took place after  they  entered  into  a  family
         relationship.  Despite the  offence  the  strong  relationship  has
         continued.  The witness considers that the offence arose  from  the
         appellant's naivety and is an isolated blip.  There are no children
         of the relationship.  The witness was born in Jamaica, the  country
         of return, but has lived in the United Kingdom from the age of six.
          He is established in the United Kingdom.  His family including his
         adult son is in the United Kingdom.  He has gainful  employment  in
         the United Kingdom that  meets  the  financial  threshold  for  the
         appellant to gain entry as an unmarried partner.  He has nothing in
         Jamaica to return for.  If the appellant is removed he will support
         her application to return as his  partner.   As  a  UK  citizen  he
         cannot be removed with the appellant.  The  appellant  and  witness
         have solid ties with the United Kingdom.  The appellant's ties with
         Jamaica are tenuous because although she was aged thirty-nine  when
         she left her close family is in USA and she has been in the  United
         Kingdom for over thirteen years.  I have  attached  weight  to  all
         these factors."

10. Details about the offence are set out in paragraph 19 of  the  decision
    as follows:

         "The appellant described her offence as follows.  Her friend was  a
         cashier at the store.  Her friend asked the appellant  to  purchase
         goods using the friend's card to  obtain  a  staff  discount.   The
         appellant used her friend's card.  The appellant did not know  this
         was  wrong.   In  addition  her  friend  voided  some  items.   The
         appellant was caught later on.  The appellant does  not  know  what
         her friend did but the appellant was telephoned.   She  was  traced
         because she had used her own bank card to pay  for  the  discounted
         items.  The appellant was not arrested.  Her bank card was involved
         so she was told to plead guilty and did so.  The Community disposal
         was 60 hours of unpaid work and restitution of �50."

11. At paragraph 42 the judge found that  apart  from  the  conviction  the
    evidence did not raise any adverse issues concerning personal  history,
    character, conduct, association or employment record.  The  refusal  of
    the long residence application did not raise  any  other  issues  apart
    from the criminal conviction.  The guidance provided by the  respondent
    showed that in applications for leave to remain  the  conviction  is  a
    discretionary ground for refusal.  The judge properly  attached  weight
    to those factors.

12. At paragraph 49, having in the preceding paragraphs of the decision set
    out the factors in favour of the appellant and the factors in favour of
    the respondent the judge found as follows:

         "I have taken full account of all relevant  considerations  as  set
         out above.  I have weighed these up, even handedly and in the round
         noting carefully the weight to be attached to the Immigration Rules
         and the strong public  interest  in  a  fair  and  firm  system  of
         immigration  control  in  the  economic  interests  of  the  United
         Kingdom.  Having done so in light of  all  the  facts  and  factors
         including the fact that I have found family life to be  established
         and the offence to be of some age and an isolated and minor one,  I
         find that the decision to  refuse  the  application  for  leave  to
         remain is disproportionate.  I find in line  with  Huang  that  the
         appellant's family life  with  the  witness  cannot  reasonably  be
         expected to be  enjoyed  elsewhere.   The  refusal  prejudices  the
         appellant's family life  in  a  manner  sufficiently  seriously  to
         amount to a breach of the fundamental rights protected  by  Article
         8.  I find that applying the principles set out in  the  case  law,
         without slavishly referring to each case  and  either  adopting  or
         distinguishing this, that the Article 8 claim of this appellant  is
         a claim that properly succeeds."

13. It is settled law that the  weight  to  be  attached  to  a  matter  is
    properly to be determined by the judge.   A  submission  that  a  judge
    attached too much or too little weight to a  particular  factor  cannot
    found an argument that the judge erred in law.  In order to succeed  in
    this application the appellant would have  to  show  that  the  judge's
    conclusion was so unreasonable as to be  perverse.   Having  considered
    his determination carefully I find that  his  conclusions  are  neither
    unreasonable nor perverse.  That does not mean that a  different  judge
    might have come to a different conclusion but that is not  the  test  I
    have to apply.

14. Overall I find the judge gave cogent reasons for his findings.  I  find
    he properly carried out the balancing exercise required of him  and  in
    so doing gave due weight to the factors in favour of the  Secretary  of
    State and gave weight to the factors in favour of the respondent before
    determining, as he was entitled to do on the evidence before him,  that
    the balance fell in favour of the Ms McIntosh.

15. For these reasons I find the Secretary of  State  has  not  established
    there is an  arguable  error  of  law  in  the  determination  and  the
    application is dismissed.

Conclusion

16. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands I do not set  aside  the
    decision.
