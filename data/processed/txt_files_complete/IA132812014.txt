                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the Appellant's appeal against the decision of  Judge  Ferguson
    made following a hearing at Birmingham on 1st September 2014.

Background

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan. He entered the UK  in  December
    2011 as a student and made an in-time application for leave  to  remain
    as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur). The application was refused  on  19th  June
    2013 under paragraph 322(1A) of  the  Immigration  Rules,  because  the
    Appellant had relied on a deception in the application  and  under  the
    Immigration Rules for Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) applicants because  he  had
    not provided satisfactory evidence that he had access to  �200,000,  by
    the provision of specified documents, to invest in business in the UK.

 3. The Appellant appealed on the grounds  that  he  had  provided  genuine
    documents and, as he had submitted his  application  on  12th  December
    2012 he had access to the �100,000 route. UKBA should have asked him to
    provide any missing evidence.

 4. The judge dismissed the Appellant's appeal and said that the  Appellant
    had failed to discharge the burden on him to show that the decision  of
    the Respondent was not in accordance with Paragraph 322(1A).

 5. The Appellant appealed against the decision on  the  grounds  that  the
    Respondent had not provided any evidence that the bank statements  were
    not genuine.

 6. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge Levin on 2nd  December  2014.
    The judge said that, given the burden of proof was on the Respondent to
    show that the bank  statement  was  false,  the  judge's  decision  was
    materially flawed.

 7. On 11th December 2014 the Respondent submitted a reply, accepting  that
    the onus was on her to prove the allegation but  stated  that  in  this
    appeal the Appellant had done nothing to rebut the allegation  or  even
    attend the hearing and in those circumstances the judge was entitled to
    reach the conclusion that he did.

The hearing

 8. There was no appearance by the Appellant. I am satisfied  that  he  was
    properly served with notice.  I note that he  did  not  appear  at  the
    hearing  before   the   original   judge,   who   recorded   that   the
    representatives had  been  unable  to  contact  him  and  were  without
    instructions.

 9. There is no reason given for the Appellant's absence today.

10. In the light of the above I decided to proceed with the appeal.

11. Miss Holmes accepted that the judge had got the burden of  proof  wrong
    but provided for me a verification report which states  that  the  bank
    statement from the National Bank of the Punjab was not issued by  them,
    and it was verified as false.  In  these  circumstances  she  submitted
    that the decision was properly made.

Findings and conclusions

12. I am satisfied that the Respondent has discharged the burden  of  proof
    upon her to show that the Appellant has relied on a false document  and
    used deception in the application.  The document verification report is
    absolutely clear.

13. The decision letter of 19th June 2013 records that the  Appellant  made
    an  application  on  17th  December  2012  for  leave  as  a   Tier   1
    (Entrepreneur).  I note in the grounds that the Appellant says that  he
    submitted the application on 12th December 2012.  Miss Holmes gave me a
    copy of the  application  which,  although  dated  as  signed  on  12th
    December, was date stamped  as  received  by  the  Respondent  on  18th
    December 2012.

14. Applications received on or after 13th December  2012  from  applicants
    wishing  to  switch  from  Tier  4  (General)   Student   to   Tier   1
    (Entrepreneur) were no longer able to access the �100,000 route.  There
    is nothing in the evidence before me, save for the Appellant's word, to
    show that this application was received before 13th December.  He is  a
    person who has been prepared to use deception in the past.

15. I find that it was on the balance of probabilities that the application
    was received on or after 13th December 2012 and therefore the Appellant
    is no longer  able  to  access  the  route  under  which  he  made  the
    application.

16. That being  the  case  the  Respondent  was  entitled  not  to  request
    additional documentation or to exceptionally consider  the  application
    under  the  provisions  of  paragraph  245AA  because  addressing   the
    omissions would not lead to a grant of leave.

17. The original decision of the judge is set aside since he erred  in  law
    in misapplying the burden of proof.  However it is remade in  the  same
    terms and the appeal is dismissed.

Notice of Decision

The appeal is dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.
