               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     Mr E MacKay, of McGlashan MacKay, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Clark, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This  is  an  appeal  against  the  decision  of  FtT  Judge  Farrelly,
    promulgated on 1 October 2019.

 2. The grounds are set out  in  an  application  dated  15  October  2019,
    characterised at [3] as failure to  give  adequate  and  comprehensible
    reasons, at [4] as making a decision no  reasonable  judge  would  have
    made,  and  at  [5]  as  failure  to  adopt  the  correct  approach  to
    credibility.

 3. The FtT granted permission on  25  November  2019,  on  the  view  that
    arguably a reasonable person would be  unable  to  understand  how  the
    judge reached his decision.

 4. In a rule 24 response dated 5  December  2019  the  SSHD  submits  that
    adequate reasons are given.

 5. The grounds fall short of showing this to be a decision which could not
    reasonably have been  reached;  but  in  the  rule  24  reply,  and  in
    submissions, the respondent has not been able to  identify  reasons  in
    the decision, taking it beyond the  judge's  general  impression  of  a
    fabricated claim.

 6. Mr Clark pointed to [37]; but that explains why  the  authorities  were
    not likely to offer protection, not why the account was  not  credible,
    as stated "consequently" at [38].

 7. Although delay in making the decision was not a ground  of  appeal,  it
    may not have helped that there was an unexplained  lapse  of  almost  3
    months between hearing and promulgation.

 8. The decision of the FtT is set aside. It stands only  as  a  record  of
    what was said at the hearing.

 9. There is a presumption that the UT will proceed to remake decisions, of
    which parties are reminded in  directions  issued  with  the  grant  of
    permission.  However, the nature  of  the  case  is  such  that  it  is
    appropriate under section 12  of  the  2007  Act,  and  under  Practice
    Statement 7.2, to remit to the FtT for an entirely fresh hearing.

10. The member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case are not to include
    Judge Farrelly.

11. The FtT made an anonymity direction, which is maintained herein.
