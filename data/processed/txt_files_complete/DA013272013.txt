Anonymity

Rule 14: The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008

No anonymity order was made by the First-tier Tribunal. I find that no
particular issues arise on the facts of this case that give rise to the
need for a direction. For this reason no anonymity direction is made.





                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

   1. The Appellant appeals the Respondent's decision dated  28  June  2013
      that section 32 UK Borders Act 2007  applies  to  him  and  making  a
      deportation order against him also of that date.  His appeal has been
      allowed on two occasions by the First-tier Tribunal, by Judge  Lester
      and more recently by Judge Gibb on 1 May 2015.   The  Upper  Tribunal
      found there to be an error of law  in  Judge  Lester's  decision  and
      remitted it for re-hearing in the First-tier Tribunal.  By a decision
      promulgated on 5 February 2016 I found there to be an error of law in
      Judge Gibb's decision but, since there were no disputes  of  fact,  I
      retained the appeal in this Tribunal.  I directed however that  there
      be a further hearing in order that the  Appellant  and  his  daughter
      could give evidence of  the  up-to-date  position  in  light  of  the
      passage of time.



   2. My Error of Law Decision is included in this decision as an Appendix.
       As a result,  there  is  no  need  for  us  to  repeat  the  factual
      background in this case, save as it affects  our  assessment  of  the
      Appellant's case.  We note also that it was agreed on the occasion of
      the last hearing in the First-tier Tribunal before  Judge  Gibb  that
      the  factual  findings  from  Judge  Lester's  decision   should   be
      preserved.  As noted at [13] of my Error  of  Law  Decision,  it  was
      agreed also for this hearing that there  were  no  factual  disputes.
      Accordingly, we incorporate into our  decision  the  earlier  factual
      findings.  Those  are  set  out  at  [4]  of  Judge  Gibb's  decision
      promulgated on 1 May 2015 and we do not need to repeat them.



   3. Some facts have however changed.  The Appellant's daughter is now  an
      adult.  The Appellant is no longer in a relationship with  Ms  Foster
      to whom he was previously engaged.  He is now in a relationship  with
      Ms Williams.  We deal with that  below.   There  is  also  before  us
      updated  documentary  evidence  in  relation   to   the   Appellant's
      employment and updated reports from his former probation officer  and
      from OASys which we have recorded  below.   There  are  also  updated
      statements from various family  members  which  we  have  taken  into
      account.  We heard evidence from the Appellant and  his  daughter  at
      the hearing.  We set that out insofar as it touches  on  the  factors
      which we need to consider in this case.  We do the same  in  relation
      to the  submissions  and  the  documentary  evidence  which  we  have
      received.  We have though taken into account all of the evidence  and
      the submissions which we received.


Legal background

   4. Before turning to assess the  relevant  factors  in  the  Appellant's
      case, we set out the   Immigration  Rules  and  statutory  provisions
      which apply or have a bearing on his case.
            Immigration Rules


            "Deportation and Article 8

           A398. These rules apply where:

           (a) a foreign criminal liable to deportation claims that his
           deportation would be contrary to the United Kingdom's
           obligations under Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention;.....

           398. Where a person claims that their deportation would be
           contrary to the UK's obligations under Article 8 of the Human
           Rights Convention, and

           (a) the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to
           the public good and in the public interest because they have
           been convicted of an offence for which they have been sentenced
           to a period of imprisonment of at least 4 years;

           (b) the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to
           the public good and in the public interest because they have
           been convicted of an offence for which they have been sentenced
           to a period of imprisonment of less than 4 years but at least 12
           months; or

           (c) the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to
           the public good and in the public interest because, in the view
           of the Secretary of State, their offending has caused serious
           harm or they are a persistent offender who shows a particular
           disregard for the law, the Secretary of State in assessing that
           claim will consider whether paragraph 399 or 399A applies and,
           if it does not, the public interest in deportation will only be
           outweighed by other factors where there are very compelling
           circumstances over and above those described in paragraphs 399
           and 399A.




           399. This paragraph applies where paragraph 398 (b) or (c)
      applies if -

              (a) the person has a genuine and subsisting parental
              relationship with a child under the age of 18 years who is in
              the UK, and

              (i) the child is a British Citizen; or

              (ii) the child has lived in the UK continuously for at least
              the 7 years immediately preceding the date of the immigration
              decision; and in either case

                 (a) it would be unduly harsh for the child to live in the
              country to which the      person is to be deported; and

                 (b) it would be unduly harsh for the child to remain in
              the UK without the  person who is to be deported; or




              (b)      the person has a genuine and subsisting relationship
              with a partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen or
              settled in the UK, and

                 (i)   the relationship was formed at a time when the person
                 (deportee) was in the UK lawfully and their immigration
                 status was not precarious; and

                 (ii)  it would be unduly harsh for that partner to live in
                 the country to which the person is to be deported, because
                 of compelling circumstances over and above those described
                 in paragraph EX.2. of Appendix FM; and

                 (iii)  it would be unduly harsh for that partner to remain
                 in the UK without the person who is to be deported.




           399A.       This paragraph applies where paragraph 398(b) or (c)
      applies if -

              (a)      the person has been lawfully resident in the UK for
           most of his life; and

              (b)      he is socially and culturally integrated in the UK;
           and

              (c)      there would be very significant obstacles to his
              integration into the country to which it is proposed he is
              deported."



           Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002: Section 117A-C
           ("Section 117")

            "PART 5A   Article 8 of the ECHR: public interest
considerations

           117A  Application of this Part

           (1)   This Part applies where a court or tribunal is required to
           determine whether a decision made under the Immigration Acts-
                 (a)   breaches a person's right to respect for private and
                 family life under Article 8, and
                 (b)   as a result would be unlawful under section 6 of the
                 Human Rights Act 1998.
           (2)   In considering the public interest question, the court or
           tribunal must (in particular) have regard-
                 (a)   in all cases, to the considerations listed in section
           117B, and
                 (b)   in cases concerning the deportation of foreign
                 criminals, to the considerations listed in section 117C.
           (3)   In subsection (2), "the public interest question" means
           the question of whether an interference with a person's right to
           respect for private and family life is justified under Article
           8(2).
           117B  Article 8: public interest considerations applicable in
      all cases

           (1)   The maintenance of effective immigration controls is in
      the public interest.
           (2)   It is in the public interest, and in particular in the
           interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that
           persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are
           able to speak English, because persons who can speak English-
                 (a)   are less of a burden on taxpayers, and
                 (b)   are better able to integrate into society.
           (3)   It is in the public interest, and in particular in the
           interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that
           persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are
           financially independent, because such persons-
                 (a)   are not a burden on taxpayers, and
                 (b)   are better able to integrate into society.
           (4)   Little weight should be given to-
                 (a)   a private life, or
                 (b)   a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,
           that is established by a person at a time when the person is  in
           the United Kingdom unlawfully.
           (5)   Little weight should be given to a private life
           established by a person at a time when the person's immigration
           status is precarious.
           (6)   In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation,
           the public interest does not require the person's removal where-
                 (a)   the person has a genuine and subsisting parental
                 relationship with a qualifying child, and
                 (b)   it would not be reasonable to expect the child to
                 leave the United Kingdom.
           117C  Article 8: additional considerations in cases involving
      foreign criminals

           (1)   The deportation of foreign criminals is in the public
      interest.
           (2)   The more serious the offence committed by a foreign
           criminal, the greater is the public interest in deportation of
           the criminal.
           (3)   In the case of a foreign criminal ("C") who has not been
           sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years or more, the
           public interest requires C's deportation unless Exception 1 or
           Exception 2 applies.
           (4)   Exception 1 applies where-
                 (a)   C has been lawfully resident in the United Kingdom
                 for most of C's life,
                 (b)   C is socially and culturally integrated in the United
           Kingdom, and
                 (c)   there would be very significant obstacles to C's
                 integration into the country to which C is proposed to be
                 deported.
           (5)   Exception 2 applies where C has a genuine and subsisting
           relationship with a qualifying partner, or a genuine and
           subsisting parental relationship with a qualifying child, and
           the effect of C's deportation on the partner or child would be
           unduly harsh.
           (6)   In the case of a foreign criminal who has been sentenced
           to a period of imprisonment of at least four years, the public
           interest requires deportation unless there are very compelling
           circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions 1
           and 2.
           (7)   The considerations in subsections (1) to (6) are to be
           taken into account where a court or tribunal is considering a
           decision to deport a foreign criminal only to the extent that
           the reason for the decision was the offence or offences for
           which the criminal has been convicted.
           117DInterpretation of this Part

           1) In this Part-
           "Article 8" means Article 8 of the European Convention on  Human
      Rights;
           "qualifying child" means a person who is under the age of 18 and
      who-
                 (a)   is a British citizen, or

                 (b)   has lived in the United Kingdom for a continuous
                 period of seven years or more;

           "qualifying partner" means a partner who-
                 (a)   is a British citizen, or

                 (b)   who is settled in the United Kingdom (within the
                 meaning of the Immigration Act 1971 - see section 33(2A) of
                 that Act).

           (2)   In this Part, "foreign criminal" means a person-
                 (a)   who is not a British citizen,
                 (b)   who has been convicted in the United Kingdom of an
           offence, and
                 (c)   who-
                       (i)   has been sentenced to a period of imprisonment
                       of at least 12 months,
                       (ii)  has been convicted of an offence that has
                       caused serious harm, or
                       (iii) is a persistent offender."



   5. The starting point is that the Appellant is a person who is liable to
      automatic deportation under section 32 UK Borders Act  2007  and  his
      deportation is conducive to the public good.   It  is  common  ground
      that the Appellant, having been convicted and sentenced to a term  of
      imprisonment of four years, cannot benefit  from  paragraphs  399  or
      399A of the Immigration Rules.  Section 117C(6) applies.  His  appeal
      can succeed only if there are very compelling circumstances over  and
      above the exceptions laid down in those paragraphs and section  117C.
      However, as the Court of Appeal made clear in Secretary of State  for
      the Home Department v JZ (Zambia)  [2016] EWCA Civ 116, that  is  not
      to say that the sorts of factors provided for in those exceptions  do
      not feature in consideration of whether  there  are  such  compelling
      circumstances (see in particular [29] of the judgment).  We turn then
      to consider the Appellant's case in that legal context.



Discussion

   6. The Appellant is now aged nearly thirty-six years old.  He arrived in
      the UK in November 1994 as a visitor to see his father who  had  come
      here to settle.  He was then aged thirteen years.  He has  not  lived
      in Jamaica though since 1983/84 when he was aged three or four  years
      old.  At that time he went to live with his mother who had settled in
      the US.  He did not have a good relationship with his stepfather  and
      his mother and  stepfather  had  other  children.   Accordingly,  his
      father applied for him to remain in the UK (during  the  currency  of
      his visit visa).  Although his application was initially refused, his
      appeal succeeded finally when the  Respondent  agreed  to  grant  him
      indefinite leave to remain in July 2000.



   7. The Appellant has therefore resided in the UK lawfully until the date
      of the deportation decision against him, albeit the  early  years  of
      his stay were with leave under section 3C of the Immigration Act 1971
      and his status was during that period precarious.  His entry was as a
      visitor at a time when it might well have  been  the  case  that  his
      father had always intended that he  should  remain  (given  the  very
      short time  from  the  date  of  his  arrival  to  the  date  of  the
      application to remain).  However, the  Appellant  was  at  that  date
      still a child and should not be blamed  for  the  intentions  of  his
      father, even if those intentions were to circumvent  the  Immigration
      Rules.


   8. The Appellant completed his secondary education here but left  school
      before completing his GCSEs.  He then attended college  but  did  not
      complete his course because, at that stage,  in  December  1997,  his
      partner gave birth to their daughter, Keira.   He  therefore  entered
      into employment.  He has never claimed benefits albeit he has changed
      his employment regularly.


   9. The Appellant has therefore spent all of his formative years  outside
      Jamaica, albeit not all in  the  UK.   He  arrived  in  the  UK  aged
      thirteen years.  His father and extended family are all  in  the  UK.
      His mother remains in the US.  The Appellant told us in evidence that
      he does retain contact with her but that is limited.  He has a  close
      relationship with  his  extended  family  in  the  UK.   His  father,
      stepmother, uncle, aunts and partner attended the hearing  before  us
      and we have received written  statements  from  those  persons.   The
      Appellant told us that he has no family members in Jamaica.  That  is
      borne out also by a statement from his grandmother.


  10. The Appellant frankly admitted that he has travelled  to  Jamaica  on
      two occasions.  Both were with a friend of his from school who  is  a
      British citizen but whose father lived in Jamaica.   The  first  time
      was in 2000 for a holiday with that friend during which  they  stayed
      with his friend's family.  The second was in 2005/6 when his friend's
      father died and  he  attended  the  funeral  in  recognition  of  the
      kindness his friend's father had shown him during the previous visit.
       He confirmed that this friend remains living in the UK.  He  has  no
      friends in Jamaica having left there at a very young age.


  11. Ms Akinbola submits and we accept that if this  were  a  case  of  an
      offence of between twelve months and four years  then  the  Appellant
      might succeed under paragraph 399A/ section 117C (Exception 2) if  it
      were accepted that there would be very significant obstacles  to  his
      integration in Jamaica.  We  note  however  that  the  Appellant  has
      managed to find employment in the UK  and  has  carried  out  various
      training courses which have broadened his skills.  He has  a  medical
      condition but not one which prevents him (generally) from working  or
      which is relied upon as a reason for him to stay in the  UK.   He  is
      generally able-bodied.  Even though he has no friends  or  family  in
      Jamaica and he does not have experience of living there except  at  a
      very young age, we  do  not  accept  that  this  amounts  to  a  very
      significant obstacle to his ability to  integrate  in  that  country.
      There are many young people who move to foreign countries with  which
      they are not familiar in order, for example, to find work.  The  main
      language of Jamaica is English.


  12. We note that, according to the facts set out in Judge Gibb's decision
      at [4(6)] the Appellant also owns a property in the UK which  he  let
      to tenants when he was in prison in order to  pay  the  mortgage.  He
      confirmed in his oral  evidence  before  us  that  he  still  owns  a
      property but we  do  not  consider  such  property  ownership  to  be
      material to our consideration of the impact on  him  of  deportation.
      The Appellant has shown his ability to adapt and survive in the UK in
      adverse circumstances (it cannot have been easy for him, for example,
      to find work as an ex offender).  We have no reason to think he could
      not do likewise in Jamaica. We do not therefore consider  that  there
      are very significant obstacles to  his  integration  in  Jamaica  and
      accordingly he could not succeed  under  paragraph  399A/Exception  2
      even if those provisions applied to him.


  13. We move on then to consider the relationship  between  the  Appellant
      and his daughter Keira.  It is evident from the earlier decisions  of
      Judge Lester and Judge Gibb  that  the  extent  and  nature  of  this
      relationship forms  the  core  of  the  claim  that  there  are  very
      compelling circumstances in this case.  It is for that reason that  I
      directed in the Error of Law Decision  that  I  would  wish  to  hear
      evidence from Keira as well as the Appellant, particularly  in  light
      of Keira having reached her majority last December.


  14. Keira has produced three statements in support of her  father's  case
      in these proceedings, two in 2013 and one more recent.  She has given
      evidence for him at the previous hearings.  She  gave  evidence  also
      before us.  She was visibly distressed throughout her evidence.   She
      told us that although she is now aged eighteen she continues to  live
      with her father.  She is at college but says that she has no  friends
      there.  She is due to finish her college course next year.   She  was
      due to complete the practical stage of her course (she is studying to
      be a nurse) but due to the uncertainty of her father's position,  she
      has been unable to focus sufficiently to do this.  She told  us  that
      she spends a lot of her time with her father.  He takes her shopping,
      they go for walks in the park together and  he  is  teaching  her  to
      drive. He is supporting her financially through college so  that  she
      does not have to work to maintain herself.


  15. The evidence  contained  in  her  earlier  statements  which  clearly
      impressed the First-tier Tribunal Judges concerns  the  impact  which
      the Appellant's imprisonment had on her.  She said in her  statements
      then that following his imprisonment, her grades and  behaviour  went
      down.  The position was turned around when he  came  out.   She  says
      that her attitude towards school changed  and  her  grades  improved.
      She describes his term of imprisonment as "one of the  hardest  parts
      of [her] life".  She says that if he were deported  it  would  "break
      [her] heart".  Having seen them together and seen her  give  evidence
      we accept that she would  indeed  find  the  Appellant's  deportation
      devastating.


  16. Keira's evidence as to the impact on her of her father's  absence  is
      attested to by both her school  at  the  time  and  by  her  mother's
      statement.  Her mother, Davina Francis, expresses "great concern" for
      the impact  of  separation  on  Keira.   Her  recent  statement  also
      confirms that the proceedings  concerning  her  father's  deportation
      have affected Keira's ability to focus.


  17. We have regard to the fact that Keira's mother (the  Appellant's  ex-
      partner) remains in the UK.  Keira said in answer to a question  from
      Mr Walker that she does maintain contact with her mother and  retains
      a room at her mother's house.  However, she says that she only visits
      her mother once or twice per week to collect clothes and then returns
      to stay with her father.  We also have regard to the fact that  Keira
      could return to Jamaica with her father if she so  wished.   We  note
      however that she remains in education and that if she were  to  leave
      this would disrupt her education.  It would also remove her from  her
      mother and her  father's  extended  family.   She  has  only  visited
      Jamaica when she was a  very  young  child  and  she  would  have  no
      experience of that country.  However, she is now a  young  adult  and
      could make a choice if her father were  deported  whether  to  remain
      here with her mother and her father's family or accompany her father.




  18. Ms Akinbola again submitted that if this were a case of a sentence of
      under four years, then it is likely that  the  Appellant  would  have
      satisfied  rule  399(a)/Section  117C  (Exception  2)  if  that  were
      available to him.  We remind ourselves though that this exception  is
      not available to him because of  his  length  of  sentence  and  also
      because Keira is now aged eighteen. As the Court of Appeal held in MM
      (Uganda) and another v Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department
      [2016] EWCA Civ 450 the question for us is not in any  event  whether
      the Appellant's deportation would have a harsh result for  Keira  nor
      even whether the result would reach a threshold  of  being  extremely
      harsh but whether, balancing the impact on  her  against  the  public
      interest, the result would be more than extremely harsh  (bearing  in
      mind that Exception 2  cannot  apply).    Of  course,  there  is  the
      additional consideration here that Keira is no longer a child and  so
      strictly Exception 2 could not apply in any event.


  19. There are other factors in favour of the Appellant's remaining in the
      UK on which Ms Akinbola  relied.   Those  are  the  presence  of  his
      extended family and his partner,  Shana  Williams.   The  Appellant's
      relationship with Ms Williams is short-lived albeit  they  have  been
      friends for a number of years.  We note that  the  Appellant  was  in
      fact in another relationship (with Ms Foster)  at  the  time  of  his
      previous appeal hearing but that this relationship  broke  down.   We
      therefore give limited weight also to  this  relationship.   We  note
      that Ms Williams says that she would not go with the Appellant if  he
      returned as she has children and other commitments of her own in  the
      UK.  However, in circumstances where the relationship as partners has
      been ongoing for only about one year, that could not amount to a very
      compelling reason to prevent the Appellant's deportation (although is
      of course a factor to be added to the overall balance).


  20.  We turn then to the significant public interest in deportation.  The
      Appellant was sentenced to a term of four years.   This  was  for  an
      offence involving Class A drugs.  Ms Akinbola submitted at one  point
      that this offending, committed she said when the Appellant was twenty-
      eight years old, was a one-off (an anomaly as she put it).  Whilst it
      is the case that the Appellant's previous  offending  is  of  a  more
      minor nature, that at least one offence was committed when he  was  a
      juvenile, that the convictions appear now to be spent and  that  none
      culminated  in  a  period  of  imprisonment,  those  convictions  are
      nonetheless factors to which we must have regard when considering the
      Appellant's risk of reoffending and the weight to  be  given  to  the
      public interest.


  21. Whilst we understand that Ms Akinbola might  have  (wrongly)  thought
      that those offences were no longer relevant to our  consideration  as
      they are spent, we are not impressed by her lack of  candour  in  not
      merely failing to mention them but positively asserting that the  two
      index offences in 2011 are the only  ones  which  the  Appellant  has
      committed.  Her submission is moreover inconsistent with the findings
      of fact which we  have  adopted  by  agreement  of  the  parties.  We
      therefore take into account that the Appellant has been convicted  on
      six occasions for eight offences  which  include  affray,  having  an
      article with blade or point in a public place, possession of class  B
      controlled drugs, using an insurance document with intent to deceive,
      using a vehicle while uninsured and failing to surrender  to  custody
      at the appointed time.  His record shows  an  escalating  pattern  of
      offending leading up to the index offence(s).


  22. We accept Ms Akinbola's submission that Section 117C(1)  requires  us
      to have regard to the seriousness of the offending - the more serious
      the offence, the greater  the  weight  to  be  given  to  the  public
      interest.  She submits that as the Appellant was  sentenced  to  four
      years' imprisonment, this falls to the lower end of the upper  scale.
      Whilst that does not affect the Appellant's inability to rely on  the
      exceptions in the rules and Section 117C, she says that  nonetheless,
      the weight to be given  is  less  than  a  case  where  the  term  of
      imprisonment is higher.  She made that submission  dealing  with  the
      Court of Appeal's  judgment  in  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
      Department v CT (Vietnam) [2016] EWCA Civ 488.   In  that  case,  the
      Court of  Appeal  overturned  the  decision  of  the  Upper  Tribunal
      allowing an appeal against deportation on the basis that  there  were
      very compelling circumstances.  Ms Akinbola submitted that in CT  the
      offences were more serious, involving firearms and that the  sentence
      for that offence was seven years.


  23. Whilst we accept that the more serious the offence  the  greater  the
      weight to be given to the public interest, that is not to be measured
      solely by reference to the term of imprisonment meted out.  In CT the
      offence was one involving a  firearm.   In  this  case,  the  offence
      involves class A drugs.  Both are in our view very  serious  offences
      and there is significant  public  interest  in  deporting  those  who
      commit such crimes.


  24. In the  Appellant's  case  he  pleaded  guilty  to  two  offences  of
      possessing a controlled drug with intent to  supply.   The  drugs  in
      question were 276.359 grams heroin with an estimated street value  of
      �10,300 and 51.845 grams cocaine with an estimated  street  value  of
      �1000.   The  OASys  Assessment  in  2014  categorises  the  risk  of
      reoffending as low.  As was said by the Court of Appeal in DS (India)
      v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2009]  EWCA  Civ  544
      however a low risk is still a risk.  That is also not the only factor
      in the public interest in  favour  of  deportation.   This  point  is
      summarised by the Court of Appeal at [37] as follows:-
            "...I do not read the passage on which Mr  Vaughan  relies  (at
      para 142, "but this is      missing the point") as demonstrating that
      the tribunal simply put out of their mind    DS's good intentions  or
      the  low  risk  that  he  may  have  presented.   They  had   already
      specifically addressed that risk  (at  para  133).   What  they  were
      saying was that, even       if they could be sure DS  would  not  re-
      offend, even so the Secretary of State might be     entitled  to  say
      that his removal from this country was in the public  interest.   The
      tribunal made that point both at para 133 and again at  para  142  of
      their      determination. In my judgment, when consideration is given
      to the manifold nature      of that public interest (see N (Kenya) at
      para 87, EO (Turkey) [2008] EWCA Civ 671,    [2008] INLR 295 at  para
      19 and OH (Serbia) v Secretary of State for  the  Home     Department
      [2008] EWCA Civ 694 at para 15), it cannot be said that the AIT erred
      in    this respect.  The public interest in deportation of those  who
      commit serious crimes       goes well beyond depriving  the  offender
      in question from the chance to re-offend in  this country: it extends
      to  deterring  and  preventing  serious  crime   generally   and   to
      upholding public abhorrence of such offending."




  25. We  take  into  account  the  Judge's  sentencing  remarks  when  the
      Appellant was convicted.  We note that the Appellant is said to  have
      "gone into business as a low level retailer" and that the  Judge  was
      "quite clear in [his] mind that it was a commercial operation".   The
      Appellant was sentenced to a term of four years on one count with two
      years on the other to  run  concurrently.  It  was  the  sentence  in
      relation to the first count which engages Section 117C(6) and  which,
      for convenience we refer to as 'the offence'.



  26. In response to this point the Appellant submits that  account  should
      be taken of the steps he has taken towards rehabilitation.  The OASys
      Assessment notes that the reasons for offending were  peer  influence
      and immaturity.  The Appellant was at the time said to be a drug user
      which impacted on the offence.  The Assessment  records  that  if  he
      were to associate with negative peers, use  drugs  or  did  not  have
      enough money and were unemployed this would increase  the  risk.   If
      however he  chose  his  friends  wisely,  maintained  employment  and
      positive family relationships, then the risk would reduce.


  27. We note that the Appellant has not reoffended since leaving prison in
      2013.  He remained on licence  until  June  2015  (not  2013  as  the
      Appellant said in evidence; although we note that he was not  certain
      of that date and we do not  take  any  point  about  that  evidence).
      However, as the  Court  of  Appeal  said  in  CT  (Vietnam)  at  [33]
      compliance with the terms of supervision is not exceptional.   It  is
      to be expected.   It might also be expected that the Appellant  would
      not reoffend whilst these proceedings were ongoing as they have  been
      since 2013.


  28. Of greater weight in the Appellant's favour is his positive  attitude
      towards his rehabilitation.  Although he initially denied his part in
      the offence, he pleaded guilty and has now acknowledged his  offence.
      He says in his evidence that being in prison was "an eye-opener"  for
      him.  He appears to have been particularly impressed  by  having  met
      the victims of drugs and, having seen the  impact  of  drug  dealing,
      says that he does not want to be involved in that sort  of  lifestyle
      in the future.  He expresses remorse for his  offence.   Having  seen
      him give evidence, we have no reason to doubt that his  intention  is
      genuine.


  29. The OASys report in 2014 says as follows:-


            "It is my assessment that Mr Forrester is in a state of mind
       currently whereby he       would not like to be part of any group
       who have a detrimental effect on society's  wellbeing.  It is my
       assessment that Mr Forrester is a better man than he was at the
       beginning of his licence in that he is aware of how each of us as
       individuals     contribute to the upkeep of society as a whole and
       he has a lot of good to    contribute".


  30. The Appellant's former probation officer has  provided  a  letter  of
      support dated 8 March 2016 confirming that he completed his period on
      licence in June 2015 and attesting to the  change  in  him  since  he
      committed the offence.  She goes on to say as follows:-



           "I had the pleasure of meeting with Mr Forrester's  daughter  as
           he wanted to introduce her to me and let me explain the work and
           intervention I would have with him whilst on licence.  This  was
           important to him as he wanted to ensure that his daughter  could
           regain trust in him and that she would eventually  see  that  he
           was committed as a father and wanted to earn his place  back  in
           her life after his absence.

           This was commendable and I understand from Mr Forrester that his
           relationship with his daughter  has  endured  and  survived  the
           journey to this point in time.  He always speaks proudly of  her
           and it is evident that she is a major motivation in  his  desire
           to succeed in his life.

           In my years of being an offender manager I have encountered many
           people who continue to repeat negative behaviour and  errors  of
           judgement despite Probation intervention.

           I am pleased to state that Mr Forrester will remain in my memory
           as one of my clients who made a decision  to  be  pro-active  in
           turning his life around.  He has matured and grown into a man  I
           perceive to hold high moral standards who has learned  from  his
           mistake and appreciates his freedom, his family and his life.

           I have no hesitation in stating that given the opportunity to do
           so, he will continue to remain a valuable member of society  and
           an asset to his family...."



  31. It is to the Appellant's credit that, since leaving  prison,  he  has
      managed to find and hold down  not  one  but  two  jobs.   There  are
      letters before us from his employers attesting to his hard  work  and
      team spirit and advocating that he should be given a  second  chance.
      We take those letters into account but the  sentiments  expressed  in
      them cannot possibly be sufficient to displace the public interest as
      expressed by Parliament.



  32. Ms Akinbola submitted that the Appellant's rehabilitation  is  likely
      to continue because of the support  he  receives  from  his  extended
      family and partner and because of the impact  of  his  offending  and
      imprisonment on Kiera.  However, we note that he has always  had  his
      extended family around him since coming to the UK.  We also note that
      Kiera was born by the time he committed the majority of his offences.
      This has not therefore deterred  him  from  offending  in  the  past.
      Perhaps it might be different now  that  he  has  served  a  term  of
      imprisonment for his last offence.  However, his  rehabilitation  and
      the possibility that he will not reoffend are only part of the public
      interest in deportation as we have already noted. Deterrence and  the
      expression of the public revulsion for offences of  this  nature  are
      another important part.



Conclusions



  33. As we have noted at [11] above, the fact that the Appellant  has  not
      lived in Jamaica since he was aged three or four is not sufficient to
      outweigh the public interest in   his  deportation  on  that  account
      alone.  We take into account cases such as Uner v Netherlands  (2007)
      45 EHRR 14 and Maslov v Austria (application number 1638/03  23  June
      2008) as we are directed to do by section 2 Human  Rights  Act  1998.
      Equally, however, we have to follow the direction  of  Parliament  as
      now set out in section 117C of the 2002 Act.  The issue whether there
      are very significant obstacles  to  a  person's  integration  in  the
      country of that person's birth is fact specific.  In this case, as  a
      result of section 117C(6), the Appellant would need to show that  the
      obstacles were  even  more  extreme  (ie  over  and  above  the  very
      significant obstacles exception).   His proven capacity to  adapt  to
      his  circumstances  and  the  skills  which  he  has  accumulated  in
      employment in the UK lead us to the conclusion that his  case  cannot
      meet that threshold.



  34. Of greater importance to his case is the  impact  of  deportation  on
      Keira.  We have noted at [15] the expectation that  deportation  will
      have a severe impact on her.  However, she is now an adult  albeit  a
      young one.  She will continue to have her mother to  support  her  as
      well  as  her  father's  family.   She  will  be   able   to   travel
      independently to visit her father and can, if she so chooses,  decide
      to accompany him to Jamaica.  Were this to be a case where  paragraph
      399(a) and Exception 2 applied, we might have found that  the  impact
      on Keira would be sufficient (just) to outweigh the public  interest.
      However, it does not apply partly because she is  now  an  adult  but
      also because of the seriousness of  the  Appellant's  offending.   It
      gives us no pleasure to make a decision which will deprive Keira of a
      father to whom she is clearly very close.  However, as Sedley LJ said
      in AD Lee v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2011]  EWCA
      Civ 348, that is a consequence of deportation.  It is  the  Appellant
      who  must  bear  the  responsibility  for  his  separation  from  his
      daughter.


  35. Having noted that the Appellant's case does not meet  either  of  the
      exceptions in paragraph 399 or 399A it is perhaps otiose to go on  to
      consider whether there are very  compelling  circumstances  over  and
      above those paragraphs which outweigh the  public  interest  in  this
      case.  However, since this involves a holistic assessment rather than
      the application of one single factor and a balancing of  the  factors
      weighing in the Appellant's favour as a totality against  the  public
      interest, we turn to carry out that exercise.  We take  into  account
      in the Appellant's favour  both  his  length  of  residence  and  his
      relationship not just with his daughter but also with Ms Williams and
      his own extended family.  It is clear that  he  will  potentially  be
      deprived completely of his relationship  with  his  partner  and  his
      relationship with his daughter  and  extended  family  will  probably
      suffer by being conducted at long distance.  We take account also  of
      the fact that he has  made  an  effort  to  rehabilitate  and  is  in
      employment.  He is now making a  positive  contribution  to  society.
      His employers and his former probation officer have spoken highly  of
      him.  He is assessed as being of low risk of reoffending.



  36. On the other hand, the Appellant's offence is very serious  involving
      Class A drugs.  It marks an escalation from his  previous  offending.
      The public interest includes not only the risk of reoffending  (which
      we accept here is low) but  also  deterrence  of  others  and  public
      revulsion at the crime    .   It  is  an  offence  which  the  public
      expects and has a right to expect will lead  to  deportation.  Taking
      into account all the factors weighing in the  Appellant's  favour  we
      are unable to find that those cumulatively amount to very  compelling
      reasons over and above the exceptions set out in paragraphs  399  and
      399A to prevent deportation.  We therefore  dismiss  the  Appellant's
      appeal.

Anonymity

Rule 14: The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008

No anonymity order was made by the First-tier Tribunal. I find that no
particular issues arise on the facts of this case that give rise to the
need for a direction. For this reason no anonymity direction is made.



                      ERROR OF LAW DECISION AND REASONS

            Background

   1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State.  For ease of reference, I
      refer below to the parties as they were  in  the  First-Tier  Tribunal
      albeit that the Secretary of State is  technically  the  Appellant  in
      this particular appeal.  The Secretary  of  State  appeals  against  a
      decision of First-Tier Tribunal Judge Gibb promulgated on 1  May  2015
      ("the Decision") allowing the Appellant's appeal against the Secretary
      of State's decision dated 28 June 2013 that section 32 UK Borders  Act
      2007 applies and making a deportation order against him also  of  that
      date.  By way  of  further  background,  the  Appellant's  appeal  was
      originally allowed  by  First-Tier  Tribunal  Judge  Lester  but  that
      decision was set aside by  the  Upper  Tribunal  on  the  Respondent's
      appeal and remitted for re-hearing.  The Appellant's appeal, as I have
      noted, was once again allowed on 1 May  2015.   Permission  was  again
      granted to the Respondent to appeal by First-Tier Tribunal Judge  Page
      on 28 May 2015.  The matter comes before me to determine whether there
      is an error of law in the Decision and if so  either  to  re-make  the
      decision or remit to the First-Tier Tribunal for  another  re-hearing.





   2. The background facts so far as it is necessary to recite them at  this
      stage are that the Appellant who is a national of Jamaica  arrived  in
      the UK on 23 November 1994 aged fourteen years.  He came as a  visitor
      to join his father, apparently from the US where he  was  living  with
      his mother.  An application was made on his  behalf  to  remain  as  a
      dependent child.  Although that application was initially refused, the
      Respondent granted the Appellant indefinite leave to remain on 18 July
      2000. The Appellant says that he has no ties in Jamaica  and  all  his
      close relatives are now in either the UK or the USA.  The Appellant is
      now aged thirty-five years.


   3. On 12 August 2011, the Appellant was convicted of possession of  class
      A controlled drugs (heroin and cocaine) with intent to supply.  He was
      sentenced to four years' imprisonment.  He was also made subject to  a
      confiscation order under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 for �20,905 or
      in default to serve twelve months'  imprisonment  consecutive  to  his
      original sentence.  The benefit was calculated at �62,307.46.


   4. In addition to his lengthy residence in the UK from a young  age,  the
      Appellant relies  on  his  relationship  with  his  daughter,  born  8
      December 1997.  She is therefore now  aged  eighteen.   She  was  aged
      seventeen at the date of the hearing before the  First-Tier  Tribunal.
      The Appellant has not been  in  a  relationship  with  his  daughter's
      mother since his daughter was aged five or six  years  but  the  Judge
      accepted  in  the  Decision  that  he  retained  a  genuine   parental
      relationship with her and she has provided letters in support  of  her
      father and gave evidence for him at the hearing before the  First-Tier
      Tribunal.  Indeed, the focus of the finding  that  the  Appellant  has
      such a strong family life in the UK that it is not outweighed  by  his
      offending depends on his relationship with his daughter.


   5. It appears from the Decision, that the Appellant  was  at  an  earlier
      stage in the proceedings also in an  unmarried  relationship  with  Ms
      Foster to whom he was engaged to be married.  She was in the  UK  with
      indefinite leave to remain but came originally  from  Jamaica.   Since
      that relationship was no longer subsisting at the date of the  hearing
      which led to the Decision, I need say no more about that.


   6. The Judge allowed the Appellant's  appeal  on  human  rights  grounds,
      finding that, although the Appellant could not avail  himself  of  the
      exceptions to automatic deportation in  paragraphs  399  and  399A  on
      account of the length of his  sentence,  there  were  very  compelling
      circumstances in his case over and above those paragraphs.



      Error of law decision and reasons




   7. The Respondent challenges the Decision on the  basis  that  the  Judge
      failed  to  properly  assess  whether  there  were   very   compelling
      circumstances over and above paragraphs 399 and 399A  and  misdirected
      himself in law by considering that the ability to  meet  the  test  in
      both paragraphs amounted to  a  sufficiently  compelling  circumstance
      without  more  (ground  one).   The  Respondent  also  challenged  the
      Decision on the basis that, in any event, the Judge had  not  properly
      understood the test  in  paragraphs  399  and  399A  when  considering
      whether the Appellant could meet either or both (if the exceptions had
      been available to him) (grounds two and three).  The  Respondent  also
      challenged the Judge's assessment of what constituted very  compelling
      circumstances over and above paragraphs 399 and 399A  by  taking  into
      account the Appellant's remorse for his offending (ground four).   The
      Respondent also took issue with the Judge's final  analysis  where  he
      indicated that others may take a different  view  of  the  case.   The
      Respondent submits that on this basis, it was not open to the Judge to
      allow the appeal as it should only be in the  clearest  case  that  an
      appeal against deportation involving a sentence of four years or  more
      should be allowed (ground five).



   8. I start by considering ground one.   It  is  common  ground  that  the
      Appellant cannot benefit from the exceptions  in  paragraphs  399  and
      399A of the Immigration Rules and something  "over  and  above"  those
      paragraphs is required in order to outweigh  the  very  strong  public
      interest in deportation where the sentence is one  of  four  years  or
      more.  It  is  convenient  to  begin  therefore  with  how  the  Judge
      approached  the  assessment  of  what  constitutes  "very   compelling
      circumstances" "over and above" those paragraphs.


   9. The Judge's principal finding as to how the Appellant met that test is
      set out as follows:-
      "[33]      It is clear and accepted that success on either the family
           life or private life exceptions is not sufficient because  those
           exceptions are closed to the appellant because of the length  of
           his sentence.  The question to be answered is whether there  are
           very compelling circumstances over and above  these  exceptions.
           The first reason for my decision that there are is that the  two
           can be combined.  If the appellant would have succeeded  on  one
           or the other, then the combination of both is a matter over  and
           above either exception..."




  10. The way in which Ms Akinbola set out her  submission  to  me  on  that
      ground and with which the Judge obviously found favour relies  on  the
      wording of the Rules.   She  suggested  that  a  combination  of  both
      paragraphs 399  and  399A  being  satisfied  would  be  sufficient  to
      outweigh either based on what she submitted was the clear  wording  of
      paragraph 398 and section 117C(6).   She relies on the use of the word
      "or" in the sentence which I have  underlined  below.   However,  that
      fails to recognise the use of the word "and" at the  end  which  makes
      quite clear that what is required is something  over  and  above  both
      exceptions whether by there being something which is  not  encompassed
      within  those  exceptions  or  because  the  interference   with   the
      Appellant's family and private life is at a higher level.
            "398. Where a person claims that their deportation would be
      contrary to the UK's   obligations under Article 8 of the Human Rights
      Convention, and
            (a) the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to
      the public good and in       the public interest because they have
      been convicted of an offence for which they  have been sentenced to a
      period of imprisonment of at least 4 years;
            (b) the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to
      the public good and    in the public interest because they have been
      convicted of an offence for which they  have been sentenced to a
      period of imprisonment of less than 4 years but at least 12   months;
            or
            (c) the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to
      the public good and in       the public interest because, in the view
      of the Secretary of State, their offending has     caused serious harm
      or they are a persistent offender who shows a particular
      disregard for the law,
            the Secretary of State in assessing that claim will consider
      whether paragraph 399 or     399A applies and, if it does not, the
      public interest in deportation will only be  outweighed by other
      factors where there are very compelling circumstances over    and
      above those described in paragraphs 399 and 399A"
            "Section 117C
            (6)In the case of a foreign criminal who has been sentenced to a
      period of   imprisonment of at least four years, the public interest
      requires deportation unless  there are very compelling circumstances,
      over and above those described in       Exceptions 1 and 2."
            [my emphasis]



  11. I am satisfied that this was an error of law.  I  go  on  to  consider
      whether that can be said to be material by looking  at  whether  there
      are other factors which, when considered cumulatively with the Judge's
      findings that paragraph 399 and 399A  would  be  met  (if  available),
      might be said to amount to very compelling circumstances  to  outweigh
      the public interest.  The Judge did  go  on  to  consider  what  other
      reasons there might be which could be said to be over  and  above  the
      exceptions.  Some of the reasons he identifies are matters  which  are
      subsumed in any event within in particular paragraph 399A (such as the
      ties  with  relatives  in  the  UK,  lack  of  ties  in  Jamaica,  the
      Appellant's age when he left Jamaica  and  the  "Maslov"  point).  The
      Judge identifies also a number of issues surrounding  the  Appellant's
      conduct, work record and reform and rehabilitation.  Whilst I  do  not
      find that the Judge erred in taking into account those matters  (which
      is the Respondent's ground four), the factors set out at [35] and [36]
      can probably best be described as a makeweight.



  12. I am therefore satisfied that the Decision contains a  material  error
      of law in relation to the Judge's approach to the question of  whether
      there exist in this case very compelling circumstances  which  can  be
      described as being  over  and  above  the  circumstances  set  out  in
      paragraphs 399 and 399A.  In those circumstances, I am satisfied  that
      the Decision should be set aside.  There is no need at  this  juncture
      for me to consider the Respondent's other grounds as the Decision will
      need to be retaken which will  require  a  re-evaluation  of  all  the
      evidence on which the Appellant relies.


  13. Mr Duffy and Ms Akinbola invited me to retain the appeal in the  Upper
      Tribunal if I found an error of law on the basis  that  there  are  no
      disputes of fact which require any further factual findings.  I  agree
      that this is the appropriate course.  I have however  found  that  the
      Judge failed to apply the proper approach to the evaluation  which  is
      required of the Appellant's Article  8  rights  when  balancing  those
      against the public interest. That is particularly relevant  where,  as
      here, the case falls to be considered not by application of paragraphs
      399 and 399A but on an overall approach to  the  Article  8  claim  in
      order to consider whether there are very compelling circumstances over
      and above  the  circumstances  envisaged  by  those  paragraphs.   The
      Appellant's appeal has been allowed by the First-Tier Tribunal on  not
      one but  two  occasions.   The  last  hearing  before  the  First-Tier
      Tribunal was in March 2015 (at which time the Appellant's daughter was
      still a minor).  It appears from  the  Decision  that  the  Judge  was
      heavily  influenced  to  allow  the  appeal  by  the  effect  on   the
      Appellant's daughter.  I do not therefore consider it  appropriate  to
      re-make the Decision based on the written evidence before  me  without
      giving the Appellant the opportunity to present  his  evidence  orally
      and for me to receive oral submissions on  the  Appellant's  case.   I
      have therefore given directions below for the case to come back before
      me at a resumed hearing to consider the re-making of the decision.



      DECISION

  14. The Decision did involve the making of a material error of law.  I set
      it aside.  I adjourn the  re-making  of  the  Decision  to  a  resumed
      hearing to be listed.  I make the following directions in relation  to
      the resumed hearing.




            DIRECTIONS

       1. Within 4 weeks from the date of promulgation  of  this  decision,
          the Appellant shall file with  the  Tribunal  and  serve  on  the
          Presenting Officer any further evidence on which he seeks to rely
          at the resumed hearing.
       2. The resumed hearing is to be listed for hearing before me on  the
          first available date after 8 weeks from the promulgation of  this
          decision with a time estimate of 3 hours. I would be assisted  by
          hearing oral evidence from  (at  least)  the  Appellant  and  his
          daughter.
       3. The Appellant's solicitors are to  file  with  the  Tribunal  and
          serve on the Presenting Officer at least  7  days  prior  to  the
          resumed hearing a paginated  and  indexed  bundle  including  all
          witness statements and other documentary  evidence  relied  upon,
          previous appeal  decisions  and  the  Respondent's  decisions  in
          relation to the Appellant.
       4. Both parties are to file with the Tribunal and serve on the other
          party at least 48 hours prior to the resumed hearing  a  skeleton
          argument  setting  out  their  legal  arguments  and  drawing  my
          attention to relevant case law and evidence on which  they  rely.
          If the parties rely on any legal authorities, they are to provide
          copies to the Tribunal and serve those on the other  party  prior
          to the hearing.
