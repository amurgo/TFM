               THE Secretary of State FOR THE Home Department
                                                                   Appellant

                       (anonymity direction not made)
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr D Mills, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms E Norman, Counsel instructed by JM Wilson
Solicitors
                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal allowing the appeal of the respondent,  hereinafter
    the claimant, against a decision of the Secretary of State refusing him
    leave to remain on human rights grounds.

 2. The difficulty in the decision is that the First-tier Tribunal  allowed
    the appeal on human rights grounds and on refugee grounds.  There  were
    no refugee grounds raised on which such a decision could hang  and  the
    Secretary of State appeals to this Tribunal on the basis that that part
    of the decision was unlawful. It was, literally, groundless.

 3. Mr Mills made it plain that there is no challenge to  the  decision  to
    allow the appeal on human rights grounds.   Ms  Norman  considered  her
    position  but  had  no  serious  arguments  to  go  raise  against  the
    contention that the Secretary of State's appeal should  be  allowed  to
    the limited extent outlined by Mr Mills.

 4. In the circumstances and we allow the appeal to the extent that we  set
    aside the decision to allow the appeal on Refugee  Convention  grounds.
    We make it plain that the decision to allow the appeal on human  rights
    grounds stands.

Notice of Decision

The Secretary of State's appeal is allowed to the limited extent  indicated
above.
