Representation:

For the Appellant:     Miss A Muzira, Solomon Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

 1. The application for permission to appeal was made by the  Secretary  of
    State but for the purposes of this appeal I will refer to  the  parties
    as they were described by the First Tier Tribunal.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 15 April 1982 and  on  5
    October 2013 he applied under the Immigration (European Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2006 for a permanent residence card as  a  confirmation  of
    his right to reside in the UK.  This was refused by the  respondent  on
    the basis that the appellant had failed to submit a divorce certificate
    and thus his marriage had been terminated.

 3. The appeal was heard by Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Amin  who
    allowed his appeal, finding that the  only  issue  in  the  appeal  was
    whether the marriage to the EEA national was no longer subsisting.   He
    found that the appellant had by the date of the  hearing  provided  the
    divorce certificate to the respondent on 27 February 2014.

 4.  He  found  the  respondent  had  not  challenged  any  of  the   other
    requirements  of  Regulation  10(5)  such  that  the  EEA  spouse   was
    exercising free movement rights in the UK at the time of  the  divorce,
    that the appellant's marriage had lasted for three years and  that  the
    appellant and his former spouse resided in the UK for at least one year
    during  their  marriage  and  that  the  appellant  was  currently   in
    employment,  self-  employment  or  economically  self-sufficient.  The
    respondent was also satisfied that the appellant had resided in the  UK
    for a continuous period of  five  years  and  that  his  former  spouse
    exercised treaty rights until the date of divorce.

 5. An application for permission to appeal by the Secretary of  State  was
    initially refused by the First-tier Tribunal but allowed on renewal  by
    Upper Tribunal Judge Kebede.

 6. The Secretary of State challenged the decision of Judge Amin,  pointing
    out that the appeal was considered on the papers on 9 October 2014.  It
    was  accepted  that  the  had  application  had  been  refused  by  the
    respondent because of the absence of the decree absolute but the  judge
    allowed the appeal on the basis  that  the  reasons  for  refusal  only
    raised one issue and that it had been answered.

 7. The most significant issue was the requirement that  the  EEA  national
    was exercising treaty rights on the date  of  the  termination  of  the
    marriage and the judge had assumed this was not in dispute because  the
    judge did not mention it. That was not the case.  There was  no  reason
    for the decision maker to consider whether the EEA national was working
    at the date of termination as there was no evidence that  the  marriage
    had been terminated.  As the evidence now showed the marriage  was  not
    terminated until after the decision.

 8. The judge was not entitled to allow the appeal without being  satisfied
    that the EEA national was a qualified person in terms of  Regulation  6
    on January 29th 2014 and the judge referred to no evidence  before  him
    that would prove this to be the case on the balance of probabilities.

The Hearing

 9. At the hearing Mr Jarvis made detailed submissions, pointing  out  that
    the judge had to make a finding as to  whether  the  wife  was  an  EEA
    national exercising her treaty rights in the UK.  When the Secretary of
    State made the decision the appellant had not  supplied  evidence  that
    his marriage had terminated but had subsequently done so.   If that was
    the judge's finding the most he should have done was allowed it to  the
    limited extent.

10. Miss Muzira submitted that the sole issue taken by  the  respondent  to
    challenge the application of the right of residence was the termination
    of the marriage and this had been supplied.

Conclusions

11. The judge at paragraph 12 set out the following:

         "The respondent had not challenged any of the other requirements of
         Regulation 10(5), the respondent  having  been  satisfied,  on  the
         documents  produced the appellant (see page 1 of refusal letter for
         list of  documents),  that  the  EEA  spouse  was  exercising  free
         movement rights in the UK at time of divorce; that the  appellant's
         marriage lasted for at least three years and that the appellant and
         his former spouse resided in the UK for at least  one  year  during
         the marriage; that the appellant was  currently  employment,  self-
         employed or economically self-sufficient.  The respondent was  also
         satisfied that the appellant had resided in the UK for a continuous
         period of five years and that his former  spouse  exercised  treaty
         rights until the date of divorce."

12. In other words the judge covered the requirements  that  needed  to  be
    shown but made no findings in that respect.  That these  elements  were
    not challenged by the Secretary of State does not mean that  the  Judge
    does not have to find that all the elements of the requirements of  the
    EEA Regulations have been met albeit that they can be shown to  be  met
    as at the date of the hearing.

13. As set out in Regulation 10(1) and 10(5):

         "10(1) In these Regulations, 'family member who  has  retained  the
             right or residence' means, subject to paragraph (8), a  person
             who satisfies the conditions in paragraph  (2),  (3),  (4)  or
             (5).

         10(5) A person satisfies the conditions in this paragraph if

             (a)  he ceases to be a family member of a qualified person  on
                  the termination of the marriage or  civil  partnership  of
                  the qualified person;

             (b)   he was residing in the United Kingdom in accordance with
                  these Regulations at the date of the termination;

             (c)  he satisfies the conditions in paragraph (6) and

             (d)  either -

             (i)  prior  to  the  imitation  of  the  proceedings  for  the
                  termination of the marriage or the civil  partnership  had
                  lasted for at least three years and  the  parties  to  the
                  marriage or civil partnership had resided  in  the  United
                  Kingdom  for at least one year during its duration;

             (ii)     the former spouse or civil partner of  the  qualified
                  person has custody of the qualified person.

             (iii)    the former spouse or civil partner of  the  qualified
                  person has the right of access to a child of the qualified
                  person under the age of 18 and a court  has  ordered  that
                  such access must take place in the United Kingdom; or

             (iv)     the  continued  right  of  residence  in  the  United
                  Kingdom  of  the  person  is  warranted  by   particularly
                  difficult circumstances , such as  he  or  another  family
                  member having been a victim of domestic violence while the
                  marriage or civil partnership was subsisting."

14.  The  judge  had  not  made  a  finding  in  respect  of  the  relevant
    requirements under 10(5) and therefore there was an error of law and  I
    set aside the determination.

15. At the hearing before me Mr Jarvis conceded that  the  evidence  showed
    that the marriage had lasted for three years and the appellant and  his
    spouse had resided in the UK for one year. The divorce certificate  had
    been produced.  The decree absolute was  issued  on  the  14th  January
    2014. There were in fact two points  in  issue  which  is  whether  the
    appellant's wife at the date  of  the  divorce  was  exercising  treaty
    rights and whether he needed to show this.  I am aware that this  is  a
    point which has now been referred to the CJEU but the fact is that  the
    appellant's case was that he could show evidence to the effect that his
    wife was exercising treaty rights at the date of divorce.

16. The question before me is whether the appellant had retained rights  of
    residence. There was some discussion as to whether the appellant  could
    show that he had been  living in accordance with  the  Regulations  for
    five years further to paragraph 15(1)(f) of  the  EEA  Regulations.  As
    Miss Muzira conceded, the appellant had  only  been  married  for  four
    years and four months by the date of the termination of  the  marriage.
    Thus, the question of the retained rights of residence and whether  the
    appellant's ex-wife was exercising treaty rights was a key  point.   It
    was not the appellant's contention that the  matter  should  be  stayed
    because he could show in fact that his wife was  exercising  rights  at
    the date of determination.

17. Mr Jarvis cross-examined the appellant as to how he  obtained  the  tax
    records of his ex-wife and the appellant confirmed that they were still
    friends and he merely asked her for the tax record  which  she  had  to
    hand because she had applied for a passport for her  new  baby.    Miss
    Muzira produced the original tax documentation in respect of  the  wife
    which was in the form of a letter dated 18  February  2015  and  showed
    that she had been in employment in  every  year  continuously  to  date
    since 2009 but particularly for the tax year ended 5 April 2009  during
    which year she earned �9,500.89.  I accept this evidence.   It  is  not
    always the case that ex-spouses are warring to  the  extent  that  they
    will not produce documentation or assist their ex-spouse.

18. I also consider whether at the date of divorce that the  appellant  was
    able to fulfil the requirement of 10(6) as follows:

         "The condition in this paragraph is that the person -

         (a)  is not an EEA national but would, if he were an EEA  national,
             be a worker, self-employed person or a self-sufficient  person
             under Regulation 6; or

         (b)  is the family member of a person who  falls  within  paragraph
             (a)."

19. His annual tax summary of 2013-14 was produced showing that  he  had  a
    taxable income of �9,611.34.  The  appellant  also  confirmed  that  he
    continued to  be  in  employment  and  demonstrated  through  his  bank
    accounts the receipt of income  from  Ashley  Noble  and  that  he  was
    working as a taxi driver.

20. I  accept  that  the  appellant  has  shown  that  he  can  fulfil  the
    requirements of the EEA Regulations for the grant of a permanent  right
    of residence under Regulation 15(1)(f).

21. The Judge erred materially for the reasons identified.  I set aside the
    decision pursuant to Section  12(2)(a)  of  the  Tribunals  Courts  and
    Enforcement Act 2007 (TCE 2007) and remake the decision  under  section
    12(2) (b) (ii) of the TCE 2007.
