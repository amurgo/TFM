Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr A Murray, Counsel for Chesham & Co Solicitors,
London
For the Respondent:    Mr Bramble, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Ghana born on  [  ]  1974.   He  appealed
    against the decision of the respondent taken on 6 January 2016 refusing
    to issue him with a permanent residence card  as  confirmation  of  his
    right to reside in the United Kingdom.  His appeal was heard  by  Judge
    of the First-Tier Tribunal Rayner on 21 April  2017.   His  appeal  was
    dismissed as it was found that not granting a residence card  does  not
    breach the appellant's rights under the EU Treaty.   The  Judge  states
    that although he makes positive factual findings about the  appellant's
    situation and his relationship with his son [M], his appeal  must  fail
    as it was initially misconceived as the appellant at no time  qualified
    for  the  permanent  residence  card  for  which  he  applied  and  the
    "alternative" ground, based on  the  European  Charter  of  Fundamental
    Rights is either not available or, if it is, the balance weighs heavily
    in favour of the respondent.

 2. An application for permission to appeal was lodged and  permission  was
    granted by Judge of the First-Tier Tribunal Hollingworth on 15 December
    2017.  This states  that  it  is  not  sought,  on  the  basis  of  the
    permission application, to argue that Article 8 would be breached.  The
    appeal is based (as is referred to at paragraph 19 of the decision)  on
    Treaty Rights.  At paragraph 23  of  the  decision  the  Judge  states,
    relating to Section 55, that the duty relates only to children who  are
    in the United Kingdom and the appellant's child is not  in  the  United
    Kingdom other than when contact takes place.  The permission finds that
    it is arguable that Section 55 applies when a child is  in  the  United
    Kingdom for the purpose of contact.  The permission goes  on  to  state
    that it is arguable that the Judge's approach to the decision has  been
    affected  by  the  restrictive  approach  adopted   relating   to   the
    application of Section 55 and it is arguable that the Judge  fell  into
    error in not  finding  that  the  Charter  was  engaged  and  that  the
    assessment of proportionality has been  affected  in  relation  to  the
    application of Section 55 which the Judge adopted.  The  grounds  refer
    to the case of Abdul [2016] 00106 (IAC).  The grounds  state  that  the
    appellant's claim is that he has access rights and parental contact  in
    the United Kingdom, with his Italian citizen son [M], at the times when
    his son enters the UK exercising his right of free movement  identified
    in  Regulation  11  of  the  Immigration  EEA  Regulations  2006.   The
    appellant previously held  a  residence  card,  issued  in  2010.   The
    grounds admit that the appellant was  unable  to  demonstrate  that  he
    qualified under the Regulations for a permanent residence card, but the
    permission states that the respondent in her decision did not  consider
    the contact issue outside the Regulations under wider EU law  or  under
    Section 55 of the 2009 Act.  It is stated  that  the  decision  of  the
    respondent breaches the appellant's rights under  the  EU  Treaties  in
    respect of entry to, or residence in, the United Kingdom.

 3. Ground 1 states that the duty imposed by Section 55 is not  defined  as
    or limited to children permanently  resident  in  the  United  Kingdom.
    Ground 2 states that the Judge is wrong in law to find that the Charter
    is not engaged as it has a direct effect in  English  law  and  is  not
    dependent on being imported  into  domestic  law  by  the  Regulations.
    Ground 3 states that  the  Judge's  assessment  of  proportionality  is
    flawed as weight should be attached to any arrangement that facilitates
    free movement and the Judge is wrong to treat as weighing  against  the
    appellant's case, that [M] is not a British citizen settled in  the  UK
    when a significant factor is precisely that the boy is an EEA  national
    exercising free movement rights.

 4. There is no Rule 24 response.

The Hearing

 5. Counsel referred me to paragraph 14 of the decision in which the  Judge
    states that although the family court contact arrangements are that the
    appellant's ex-partner Ms [F] had not to  remove  the  child  from  the
    United Kingdom she had done so, but the appellant decided not to pursue
    action over the breach of the court order in  case  she  would  try  to
    prevent him from seeing his son at all.  Counsel pointed out  that  the
    appellant pays �300 a month to Ms [F] for the child.  At  paragraph  16
    of the decision the Judge notes that Ms [F] wants the  child's  father,
    the appellant, to have a good relationship with [M].  She  states  that
    the child wants to see his father.

 6. Counsel referred to paragraph 18 of the decision which  refers  to  [M]
    being an EEA citizen exercising  his  Treaty  Rights  by  visiting  the
    United Kingdom.  This paragraph goes on to state  that  the  respondent
    must have  regard  to  Section  55  of  the  Borders,  Citizenship  and
    Immigration Act  2009.   At  paragraph  19  the  Judge  refers  to  the
    appellant's representative submitting that Article 7  of  the  European
    Charter of Fundamental Rights affirms the right to family  and  private
    life in terms analogous to Article 8 of ECHR.  In  this  paragraph  the
    Judge states that it is in [M]'s best interests that contact continues.



 7. Counsel then referred to the Judge's findings and reasons at  paragraph
    21 of the decision and submitted that the facts are  not  significantly
    in dispute.  At 21(ii) the Judge finds that [M] is an EEA national.  At
    21(iv) he finds that the appellant is of  good  character.   At  21(ix)
    although the Judge finds that the appellant may  have  exaggerated  the
    frequency of contact since his separation from Ms [F], the  quality  of
    the contact is good.

 8. Counsel then referred to paragraph 23 of the decision and the  case  of
    Amirtaymour v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2017]  EWCA
    Civ 353 which refers to a quasi human rights argument.   The  Judge  in
    this paragraph refers to the duty of the respondent, Section 55 of  the
    2009 Act and the best interests of children but  he  states  that  this
    duty relates to  children  who  are  in  the  United  Kingdom  (Section
    55)(i)(a).  The Judge states [M] is not in  the  United  Kingdom  other
    than when contact takes place.  At paragraph 25  the  Judge  refers  to
    none of the three parties in this case being a UK citizen.   The  Judge
    goes on to state that contact between [M] and the  appellant  would  be
    most beneficial to the appellant if he were allowed to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom and may be best for [M] but he refers to  contact  being
    able to continue if he were in Ghana or  Italy.   Because  of  this  he
    finds that [M]'s right to  family  life,  in  terms  of  his  right  to
    exercise freedom  of  movement  Treaty  Rights,  is  not  significantly
    affected by  refusing  the  appellant's  application  for  a  permanent
    residence card in the UK.

 9. Counsel then referred me to the said case of Abdul at the heading  (ii)
    regarding Section 55 and I was referred to paragraph 26  of  that  case
    which states that the reach of the Charter is more expansive  than  the
    European Convention on  Human  Rights  and  Fundamental  Freedoms.   At
    paragraph 27 of that case Article 24(3) states "Every child shall  have
    the right to maintain on a regular basis, a personal  relationship  and
    direct contact with both of his or her parents, unless this is contrary
    to his or her interests".

10. I was then referred to paragraph 28 of Abdul and the case of Deticek -v-
     Sgueglia [2009] EUECI C-403/09.  At paragraph 56 of that  case  it  is
    stated "It is clear that the wrongful removal of a  child  following  a
    decision taken unilaterally by one of the parents, more often than  not
    deprives the child of the possibility of maintaining on a regular basis
    a personal relationship and direct contact with the other parent".   He
    submitted that although this is not the same  as  in  this  appellant's
    case it amounts to the same thing.

11. I was then referred to paragraph 29 of the case of Abdul  which  refers
    to a case McB  - v- Ele [2010] EUECI C-400/10  which  states  that  the
    fundamental rights of the child cannot be disregarded.  At paragraph 30
    of Abdul it is stated "I consider  it  clear  that  Article  24(3)  was
    designed to create a discreet right, an analysis  which  is  harmonious
    with the general principles of EU law".  The paragraph goes on to state
    that this construction is further fortified by the  commentary  of  the
    Charter of Fundamental Rights of  the  European  Union  at  page  207:-
    "Children are no longer considered as mere recipients  of  services  or
    beneficiaries of protective measures but rather as rights  holders  and
    participants in actions affecting them".

12. Counsel then referred to the grounds and submitted that although [M] is
    not permanently resident in the United Kingdom he comes  regularly  and
    he submitted that the case of Abdul states that the Judge was wrong  to
    find that the Charter was  not  engaged.   At  paragraph  25  of  Abdul
    reference is made to the proportionality assessment and  it  is  stated
    that when the  Judge  found  that  public  interest  must  prevail  the
    proportionality assessment  and  conclusion  was  legally  flawed.   He
    submitted that although [M] is not a  British  citizen  he  is  an  EEA
    national and is entitled to free movement.  He submitted that the  fact
    that none of the parties in this case is a UK citizen does not shut the
    child out of his EEA rights.   He  is  entitled  to  visit  the  United
    Kingdom to see his father and he submitted that not to allow this would
    be against the spirit of EEA law and this is a material error of law by
    the First-Tier Judge.

13. The Presenting Officer made his submissions submitting that there is no
    merit in these grounds.  He referred to Section 55 and  whether  it  is
    engaged or not and he submitted that even if it is,  this  may  not  be
    material.  He submitted that the relevant circumstances  in  this  case
    have to be considered and  I  was  referred  to  paragraph  25  of  the
    decision in which  the  Judge  refers  to  this  and  states  "The  EEA
    Regulations provide for  rights  to  reside  in  specific  and  defined
    circumstances.  That does not import a  balancing  exercise  of  rights
    under the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.  Even if it does, the
    balance would weigh, in terms of a residence card application,  heavily
    in favour of the respondent".  He submitted that this has been properly
    considered by the Judge and I was asked to consider the case  of  Abdul
    again.  He referred me to paragraph 7 which refers to Article 24(3)  of
    the Charter "Every child shall have the right to maintain on a  regular
    basis a personal relationship and direct contact with both  of  his  or
    her parents, unless this is contrary to  his  or  her  interests".   He
    submitted that in the case of Abdul the appellant was an  EEA  national
    appealing against deportation. In Abdul a deportation  would  break  up
    the relationship of  the  appellant  with  his  two  British  children,
    therefore in the case of  Abdul,  because  the  appellant  was  an  EEA
    national and because the children were British he was allowed  to  stay
    in Britain.

14. The Presenting Officer submitted that that is not the  case  here.   In
    this case [M]'s mother is  Italian  and  so  is  [M].   His  father  is
    Ghanaian.  He wants residence in the United Kingdom.  He submitted that
    the First-Tier Judge at paragraph 25 of his  decision  has  taken  this
    into account and has noted that none of the parties  in  this  case  is
    British.  I was referred to paragraphs 15  and  16  of  the  First-Tier
    Judge's decision which refers to the evidence of the  parties  in  this
    case.  The appellant has stated that he could go to Italy but it  would
    be better to go back to Ghana financially, as in  Italy  he  will  have
    problems with the language and the politics and economy are not so good
    there.

15. Ms [F] states that the appellant would have difficulty securing work in
    Italy but the Presenting Officer submitted that there  is  actually  no
    reason why the appellant cannot go to live in Italy if he wants  to  be
    near his son.  Also, the appellant has admitted that even if he goes to
    live in Ghana he will continue having contact with  his  son.   All  of
    this is considered by the Judge at paragraph 25 of the decision and  if
    the appellant is not granted a residence card the  child's  freedom  of
    movement will not significantly be affected.  Contact can take place in
    another EU country or in  Ghana.   He  submitted  that  the  Judge  has
    considered the matter under  the  Charter  and  has  gone  through  the
    specific issues and has found against the appellant.  I  was  asked  to
    uphold the First-Tier Judge's decision.

16. Counsel for the appellant referred to Section 55 and submitted that  it
    is engaged and the fact that it is engaged is material.  He referred to
    paragraph  25  of  the  Judge's  decision  when  he  states  that   the
    application involves three individuals, two of whom are  EEA  nationals
    but none of whom  are  United  Kingdom  citizens.   He  submitted  that
    because they are not British does not stop them having  rights  in  the
    United Kingdom and he submitted that paragraph 27 of the case of  Abdul
    is on point relating to the rights of the child.

17. He submitted that the appellant could go to stay in Italy but the Judge
    finds that it would be better for the  child  if  the  appellant  could
    remain lawfully in the United Kingdom.  He submitted that the  problems
    with the appellant going to Italy have been referred  to.   At  present
    the appellant supports the child by paying �300 per  month  but  if  he
    goes to Italy he will have problems finding work  there  because  of  a
    number of matters, in particular the language and he submitted that the
    First-Tier Judge has erred in law relating to this.  He submitted  that
    there is a fluid position and although the family  court  order  stated
    that Ms [F] should not take the child out of the country she did so and
    the appellant has not objected to this  because  he  has  been  allowed
    contact with the child in the United Kingdom and  now  sees  the  child
    regularly.

18. I asked him if, as has been suggested, Ms [F] may come back to live  in
    the United Kingdom with the child and he said that  she  has  mentioned
    this but there is nothing definite.  He submitted  that  the  important
    thing is the appellant and his child having regular contact.   I  asked
    him how regular the contact is as at paragraph 21(ix)  of  the  Judge's
    decision he states "I  find  that  Mr  [Q]  may  have  exaggerated  the
    frequency of contact since their separation".  Counsel  was  unable  to
    answer the question but pointed out that the Judge states  that  he  is
    satisfied that the quality of the contact is good and it  is  important
    to [M].  He refers to the appellant's commitment to [M]  and  the  fact
    that he provides financially for him.



Decision and Reasons

19. The argument put to me by Counsel for  the  appellant  is  interesting,
    however I have paid particular attention to paragraph 25 of the Judge's
    decision.  The EEA Regulations do  provide  for  rights  to  reside  in
    specific and defined circumstances but that does not import a balancing
    exercise of rights under the European Charter  of  Fundamental  Rights.
    The Judge goes on to say that even if it does the balance would  weigh,
    in terms of a residence card application,  heavily  in  favour  of  the
    respondent.

20. He correctly points out that none  of  the  parties  in  this  case  is
    British.  He states that it would be most beneficial to  the  appellant
    if he were allowed to remain in the United Kingdom and  that  could  be
    best for [M], but he refers correctly to  the  appellant  acknowledging
    that contact can continue if he was in Ghana or he could move to Italy.
      The  difficulties  about  the  appellant  moving  to  Italy  are  not
    prohibitive and I find that the solution to this claim is a  matter  of
    choice.

21. The appellant is not  entitled  to  a  residence  card  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  He has no right to be in the United Kingdom.  [M] has a right
    to family life and has a right to freedom of movement but the appellant
    does not require to be in the United Kingdom for [M] to exercise  these
    rights and although the appellant may not be able  to  provide  �300  a
    month to Ms [F] for their child, there was nothing before the Judge  to
    show that the appellant would be unable  to  get  a  job  in  Italy  or
    another EU country or that he would be unable to get a job in Ghana.

22. It is in the best interests of the child to continue his  contact  with
    his father.  I have noted the case of Abdul but  the  circumstances  of
    that case are quite different to this case, as was pointed out  by  the
    Presenting Officer.  The appellant was an EEA national and the children
    were British.  In this  case  the  appellant  is  from  Ghana  and  the
    children are EEA nationals.  None of them are UK citizens.

23. It is clear that there is contact between the appellant and  his  child
    but it is not clear how regular that  contact  is.   The  question  was
    asked but does not appear to  have  been  answered  at  the  First-Tier
    hearing.

24. The appeal based on the European Charter of Fundamental  Rights  cannot
    succeed.  When it is considered in depth the balance weighs heavily  in
    favour of the respondent. The appellant is not entitled to a  residence
    card in the United Kingdom in the circumstances of this claim.

Notice of Decision

25. The decision of the First-Tier Tribunal promulgated on 15 May 2017 must
    stand as there is no material error of law in that decision.

26. Anonymity has not been directed.
