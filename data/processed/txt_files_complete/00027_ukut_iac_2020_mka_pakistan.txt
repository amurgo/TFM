   1) The Upper Tribunal can apply rule 43 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper
      Tribunal) Rules 2008 of its own motion.
   2) The use of fraud before the Upper Tribunal  constitutes  an  abuse  of
      process such as to amount  to  a  "procedural  irregularity"  for  the
      purposes of rule 43(2)(d).
   3) In  a  case  involving  a  decision  under  paragraph  322(5)  of  the
      immigration rules, where an individual  relies  upon  an  accountant's
      letter admitting fault in the submission of incorrect tax  returns  to
      Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, the First-tier or Upper Tribunal is
      unlikely to place any material weight on that letter if the accountant
      does not attend the hearing  to  give  evidence,  by  reference  to  a
      Statement of Truth, that explains in detail the circumstances in which
      the error came to be made; the basis and nature of  any  compensation;
      and whether the firm's insurers and/or any  relevant  regulatory  body
      have been informed. This  is  particularly  so  where  the  letter  is
      clearly perfunctory in nature.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

A. INTRODUCTION

 1. The appellant in this case is the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department.  However, for the sake of clarity, we shall use the  titles
    by which the parties were known before the  First-tier  Tribunal,  with
    the Secretary of State referred to as "the respondent" and Mr Abbasi as
    "the appellant".

 2. The appellant is a citizen of  Pakistan.   He  arrived  in  the  United
    Kingdom as a student in 2006.  In 2010 he applied for leave  to  remain
    as a Tier 1 HS (General) Migrant and was granted leave in that capacity
    until March 2012.  Further such applications were also successful.

 3. In March 2016, the appellant applied for indefinite leave to remain  as
    a Tier 1 HS (General) Migrant.  The application was subsequently varied
    to an  application  for  indefinite  leave  to  remain  based  on  long
    residence.

 4.  The  appellant's  application  in  that  regard  was  refused  by  the
    respondent in September 2016.  That refusal also comprised the  refusal
    of a human rights claim by the appellant, which  meant  that  he  could
    appeal to the First-tier Tribunal. Appeals were also made to the First-
    tier Tribunal by the appellant's wife and one of their children.

 5. The reason for the refusal by the  respondent  centred  upon  paragraph
    322(5) of the Immigration Rules, whereby leave to enter  or  remain  in
    the United Kingdom should normally be refused if, in the light  of  the
    conduct, character or associations of the applicant (or the  fact  that
    he represents a threat to national security), it would  be  undesirable
    to permit the person concerned to remain in the United Kingdom.

 6. In the case of the appellant,  the  respondent  was  concerned  by  the
    following matters.  In his application for leave to remain of 2011, the
    appellant claimed to have an income  of  �51,036.51  from  all  sources
    between 1 February 2010 and 31 January 2011, including �35,056.00  from
    self-employment.  If that were true,  the  appellant  was  entitled  to
    30 points under the  "previous  earnings"  category  in  the  relevant
    Immigration Rules.  As part of his application for leave to  remain  in
    2013, the appellant claimed to have an income of  �57,506.20  from  all
    sources  between  1  February  2012  and  31  January  2013,  including
    �45,777.77 from dividends.  This entitled the appellant to the award of
    35 points.

 7. The respondent wrote to the appellant in May  2017  and  asked  him  to
    complete  a  tax  questionnaire.   The  appellant   answered   in   the
    affirmative to the question "Have you ever needed  to  correct  or  re-
    submit your tax return ... ?".

 8. A revised tax calculation for the appellant dated 10  May  2016  showed
    that he initially declared to HMRC a  total  income  for  2010/2011  of
    �13,612.  That level of earnings would have meant  that  the  appellant
    received 0 points for previous earnings, leaving him 30 points short of
    the tally required to obtain leave.

 9. The same revised tax calculation showed that the appellant amended  the
    figures declared to HMRC in order to show total income received for the
    relevant period of �51,036,  including  �37,424  from  self-employment.
    That amendment meant that the relevant earnings were "more in line with
    those claimed" to the respondent as part of the appellant's application
    for leave.

10. The revised tax calculation of the appellant for 2012/2013, also  dated
    10 May 2016, showed that  the  appellant  initially  declared  a  total
    income to HMRC of �7,488.   Again,  that  would  have  meant  that  the
    appellant received 0 points for previous earnings and would  have  been
    35 points short of the tally required to obtain leave to remain.

11. The amended tax calculation for 2012/2013  resulted  in  the  appellant
    declaring to HMRC a total income for the  relevant  period  of  �58,517
    including �44,222 from dividends.  Again, this amendment was  "more  in
    line" with what the appellant had claimed to  the  respondent  was  his
    total income.

12. The tax re-calculations, which followed from the  amendments,  resulted
    in the appellant's tax  liability  for  2010/2011  rising  from  �0  to
    �4,487.45.  For  2010/2011,  the  tax  liability  rose  from  �0.40  to
    �11,454.12.

13. The respondent concluded that:-

         "The delay of several years in correcting your declaration to  HMRC
         indicates that you had little intention of  correcting  the  errors
         promptly and as such show little respect for the UK tax laws.

         It would not be considered a credible explanation that a registered
         accountant would submit  a  self-assessment  tax  return  declaring
         earnings which are considerably lower than  their  client's  actual
         earnings.  It was your  responsibility  to  ensure  that  your  tax
         return  was  submitted  to  HMRC  on  time  and  with  the  correct
         information.

         The Secretary of State considered that it would be undesirable  for
         you to remain in the United Kingdom in light of your character  and
         conduct.   She  is  satisfied  that  you  have  misrepresented  you
         earnings at various times and from time to time have  changed  what
         you have represented in respect of your earnings to HM Revenue  and
         Customs and/or UK Visas and Immigration for the purpose of reducing
         your tax liability or for the purpose of obtaining leave to  remain
         or both."

    The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal. Following a  hearing
    in September 2018, a First-tier Tribunal Judge allowed the  appellant's
    appeal and that of his wife and daughter.



B. THE DECISION OF THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL

14. The First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  considered  that  the  respondent  had
    supplied evidence  of  significant  discrepancies  between  the  income
    figures submitted by the appellant to  HMRC  and  for  the  purpose  of
    obtaining leave to remain.  She found, however, that:-

         "41. ... the appellant put forward an innocent explanation for  the
             discrepancy.   He  states  that  he   was   relying   on   the
             professional services of his accountants who submitted the tax
             form online which he did not see.  I  accept  the  explanation
             that he has provided as often those instructing  professionals
             rely on their expertise and have confidence in their work.   I
             also accept that professionals such as  accountants  can  make
             mistakes.  As soon as the [appellant] became aware of this  he
             changed his accountants, notified the HMRC and he is  repaying
             the overdue tax to HMRC.

         ...

         45.  The [appellant] states that when he became aware of the  error
             made  by  his  accountants  he   contacted   his   accountants
             immediately and notified them of the  error,  for  which  they
             apologised.  The [appellant's] accountants provided  a  letter
             confirming that there was an unreported income  for  the  year
             2010-2011 and 2012-2013 (See respondent's  bundle  D15  letter
             from Tax Assist Accountants).

         ...

         47.  Looking at all the evidence in the round, I conclude that  the
             respondent has not discharged his burden of demonstrating that
             it is more probable than not that the appellant used deception
             in declaring his income to either the  HMRC  or  inflated  his
             earnings to the respondent.  The most that can be  said  about
             him is that he was somewhat na�ve, placed too  much  trust  in
             his accountant, and failed  to  exercise  sufficient  scrutiny
             himself ...."

15. Having concluded,  for  these  reasons,  that  the  appellant  met  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules, it followed that it would  be  a
    disproportionate interference with the appellant's  Article  8  rights,
    and those of his family in  the  United  Kingdom,  if  he  were  to  be
    removed.   Accordingly,  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  allowed  the
    appeals.

16. It is evident from the First-tier Tribunal Judge's  decision  that  she
    placed significant weight on a letter to be found at D14 of the  bundle
    of documents before her.  The letterhead reads "TaxAssist Accountants -
    The Accountancy and Tax Service for Small  Business".   The  letter  is
    dated 25 May 2017.  It is addressed "To Whom it May Concern".  It reads
    as follows:-

         "Dear Sir/Madam,

         This is to confirm that Mr Muhammad  Kamran  Abbasi  has  appointed
         TaxAssist Accountants as his HMRC authorised Agent and  Accountants
         for all his Self-Employment and tax related services.

         We are enclosing Mr Abbasi 2010-11 to 2015-16  tax  returns,  SA302
         and tax overviews.  Please note that Mr Abbasi 2016-17  tax  return
         is not submitted as it is due to HMRC by 31 January 2018.

         I am writing to confirm that our client's tax returns for the years
         2010/11 and 2012/13 were submitted with incorrect details.

         The mistake was from our side as we  inadvertently  mixed  earnings
         details of two clients.

         Late, We approached our client and pointed out this mistake and  we
         amended the HMRC records accordingly and client was compensated.

         Although we always try to maintain high level of standards  in  our
         professional work and engagement, but as a human being  errors  and
         mistakes can't be ruled out.

         Please  consider  this  as  a  genuine  mistake  which  should  not
         adversely affect Mr Abbasi application.  If you have any questions,
         please do not hesitate to contact us.

         Yours faithfully,

         [Signature]

         TaxAssist Accountants

         Samantha Skyring - ACCA Membership no. [redacted]"

17. Pro-forma information at the bottom of the letter gives the address  of
    TaxAssist Accountants as 390 Hoe Street, Walthamstow.  It  also  states
    that the business is  "A  TaxAssist  Accountants  Franchise  owned  and
    operated under licence by Nadeem Iqbal.  Directors: Nadeem Iqbal".

C.  THE DECISION OF THE UPPER TRIBUNAL

18. The respondent obtained permission to  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal
    against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge.  The appeal came
    before Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Chamberlain on 8 January 2019.  In a
    decision dated 28 January 2019, she found that the First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge's decision contained an error of law.   The  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge had "failed to conduct a proper analysis  of  the  evidence,  and
    failed to give adequate reasons for  finding  that  the  appellant  was
    na�ve rather than dishonest".  The judge  had  made  no  clear  finding
    regarding when the appellant found out about the errors and  had  given
    no reasons for accepting the claim that the appellant did  not  realise
    until January 2016 that anything was amiss.  The judge had also made  a
    factual error when setting  out  the  evidence  of  how  the  appellant
    discovered the true position.  Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge  Chamberlain
    accordingly set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

19. Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Chamberlain re-heard  the  matter  in  June
    2019.  The Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge considered that, in the light of
    the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Balajigari v Secretary of  State
    for the Home  Department  [2019]  EWCA  Civ  673,  the  respondent  was
    required to state, in terms, in her  decision  that  a  person  in  the
    position of the appellant had used  dishonesty.   It  was  "not  enough
    merely to set out that there is a discrepancy" (paragraph 15).   Since,
    in the present case, the respondent had not  contended  expressly  that
    the appellant had been guilty of dishonesty, the Deputy Upper  Tribunal
    Judge concluded that the respondent had not discharged  the  evidential
    burden upon her in cases involving the application of paragraph  322(5)
    of the Immigration Rules.

20. The Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge, nevertheless, went on to make findings
    in the event that she was wrong about her  application  of  Balajigari.
    She concluded that the appellant had,  in  any  event,  discharged  the
    burden on him to show that dishonesty and deception were  not  employed
    and had provided an explanation for the discrepancy in the figures.

21. The Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge  considered  it  significant  that  the
    appellant had "voluntarily informed the respondent  that  he  had  made
    amendments to his tax return" in March 2016, when  his  solicitors  had
    written to the respondent to say that the appellant "has  also  revised
    his income tax returns for the period of 2010-11,  2012-13  because  of
    some  errors  and  he  has  provided  updated  copies  of  returns  and
    accounts".

22. Having found that "the appellant used and relied on accountants, and  I
    find that there is nothing implausible or unusual in  this"  (paragraph
    23), the Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge's decision continued as follows:-

         "24. It was submitted by Mr Karim that  the  accountant  had  taken
             responsibility for the error.  I was referred  to  the  letter
             from Samantha Skyring, an accountant at TaxAssist Accountants,
             dated 25 May 2017 (D14 of the Respondent's bundle).   She  has
             given her ACCA membership number.  Ms Skyring states:

                  "I am writing to confirm that our client's tax returns for
                  the years 2010/11 and 2012/13 was submitted with incorrect
                  details.

                  The mistake was from our side as  we  inadvertently  mixed
                  earnings details of two clients."

         25.  It was  submitted  by  Mr  Karim  that  it  was  dangerous  to
             underplay the consequences of an accountancy firm admitting to
             such a mistake as it opened the firm up to being sued.  It was
             implausible that any professional would put pen  to  paper  in
             this way  if  he  was  not  responsible,  given  the  possible
             repercussions.  It was submitted that full  weight  should  be
             given to the admission by the accountants.

         26.  I find that  there  is  force  in  this  submission.   It  was
             submitted by Mr  Avery  that  there  were  some  discrepancies
             between the evidence of the [appellant] and  the  evidence  in
             the letter, in relation to how the mistake had been  made.   I
             find that these are not significant given that the  accountant
             has admitted the mistake.  The core of the [appellant's] claim
             is that the accountant made the mistake, which is supported by
             the  letter.   The  [appellant's]   evidence   is   that   the
             accountants did not declare his self-employment income at all.
              In the letter it states that they mixed the earnings  details
             of  two  clients.   However,  these  two  are   not   mutually
             exclusive.  There is nothing inconsistent."

23. At paragraph 30, the Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge considered it did  not
    detract from the appellant's evidence that he was still using the  same
    accountants.  That appears to conflict with the evidence given  by  the
    appellant to the First-tier Tribunal Judge who recorded at paragraph 21
    of  her  decision  that  when  the  appellant  came  to  learn  of  the
    discrepancies "he changed his accountant in 2016".  Be that as it  may,
    the  Deputy  Upper  Tribunal  Judge's  decision  concluded   that   the
    respondent  had  "wrongly  applied  paragraph  322(5)"  and  that   the
    appellant met the requirements of "paragraph 276B  of  the  Immigration
    Rules".  That being so, the Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge concluded  that
    the human rights appeal of the appellant and his wife and child  should
    be allowed, since it would  be  a  disproportionate  interference  with
    their Article 8 rights if they were to be removed.

D. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

24. The Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge's decision was promulgated on  10  July
    2019.  On 16 September 2019, the Upper Tribunal received an e-mail from
    TaxAssist Direct Limited.  The e-mail  caused  the  Upper  Tribunal  to
    convene a hearing, which took place on 25  November  2019.   The  Upper
    Tribunal indicated that it intended to consider  whether  it  would  be
    appropriate to use its powers  under  rule  43(2)(d)  of  the  Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 to set aside the decision of  the
    Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge.

25. So far as relevant, rule 43 provides as follows:-

         "Setting aside a decision which disposes of proceedings

         43.(1)   The Upper Tribunal may set aside a decision which disposes
                of proceedings, or part of such a decision, and re-make  the
                decision or the relevant part of it, if-

                (a)    the Upper  Tribunal  considers  that  it  is  in  the
                    interests of justice to do so; and

                (b)    one or more of the conditions in  paragraph  (2)  are
                    satisfied.

           (2)    The conditions are-

                (a)    a document relating to the proceedings was  not  sent
                    to, or was not received at an  appropriate  time  by,  a
                    party or a party's representative;

                (b)    a document relating to the proceedings was  not  sent
                    to the Upper Tribunal at an appropriate time;

                (c)    a party, or a party's representative, was not present
                    at a hearing related to the proceedings; or

                (d)    there has been some other procedural irregularity  in
                    the proceedings.

           (3)    Except where paragraph (4) applies, a party applying  for
                a decision, or part of a decision, to  be  set  aside  under
                paragraph (1) must make a written application to  the  Upper
                Tribunal so that it is received no later than 1 month  after
                the date on which the Upper  Tribunal  sent  notice  of  the
                decision to the party."

26. On 14 November  2019,  Ms  Skyring  filed  a  witness  statement.   The
    relevant paragraphs read as follows:-

         "3.  I am employed by TaxAssist Direct Limited  and  have  been  in
             their employment since November 2014.

         4.    My  current  day  to  day  role  is   Senior   Training   and

             franchisees  of  which  Nadeem  Iqbal  trading  as   TaxAssist
             Walthamstow is one.  For the avoidance  of  doubt,  therefore,
             TaxAssist Walthamstow is an independent and different  trading
             entity from TaxAssist Direct ltd.

         7.   I have read and fully examined document D14 that is  a  letter
             dated 25 May 2017, purportedly signed by  me,  in  respect  of
             which I would comment as follows:

             a.    It  is  on  the  notepaper  of   TaxAssist   Accountants
                  Walthamstow which as stated  above  is  a  franchisee  and
                  hence a separate legal entity, by which I am not employed.
                   However,  it  clearly  purports  to  suggest  that  I  am
                  employed or engaged by that business when this is not  the
                  case.

             b.   I did not create this letter and I am not aware  of  this
                  document having been created by any  member  of  staff  at
                  TaxAssist Direct Ltd.

             c.   I did not sign this letter and nor do any  colleagues  of
                  mine sign or have authority to sign letters on my  behalf.
                  The signature is not only not mine but does  not  resemble
                  my signature.

             d.   I had no knowledge that this document  existed  until  it
                  was brought  to  my  attention  by  a  colleague  on  13th
                  September 2019.

             e.   I do not have any knowledge of D15 that appears to  be  a
                  letter from the franchisee to HMRC or of E1 that seems  to
                  be a related tax calculation.

             f.   I would not in any event be asked  to  produce  a  letter
                  such as this or to be involved in the creation of  such  a
                  document.  It is not within my  remit  or  qualifications.
                  Whilst  TaxAssist  Direct  Ltd  provides  a  service   for
                  franchisees, when the franchisee does not  itself  have  a
                  certain qualification under which circumstances a suitably
                  qualified employee of  TaxAssist  Direct  Ltd  can  assist
                  them, I do not prepare letters covering in  this  area  or
                  work in any event.  Indeed, not only is this  not  of  the
                  type of document I would sign off but I would be in breach
                  of the  Association  of  Certified  Chartered  Accountants
                  professional rules in doing so.

             g.   I have never met and have no knowledge of Muhammed Kamran
                  Abbasi and nor have I ever been asked to assist him in any
                  way whatsoever through TaxAssist Direct Limited, TaxAssist
                  Accountants  Walthamstow  or  directly.    I   have   only
                  corresponded with Nadeem Iqbal through email and maybe the
                  odd phone call but not very often.

             h.   The style of the letter is not mine.   It  contains  some
                  punctuation and  style  errors.   Generally  it  does  not
                  'read' as the professionally drafted letter that  I  would
                  ever create.

             i.   I would not ordinarily deploy my ACCA Membership  in  any
                  form of correspondence or emails.  I am suspicious  as  to
                  how  that  membership  number  has  been  acquired  to  be
                  included in this document.  The only way  I  believe  they
                  could have obtained this would be by  my  handing  it  out
                  where a student for either ICAEW or ACCA needed me to sign
                  off their work  experience  to  become  a  member  of  the
                  relevant body.  In order for me to do this I  have  to  be
                  appointed as their supervisor via the body and as a result
                  need to give the student my ACCA membership number so they
                  can add me.  In this regard  I  should  add  that  Mansoor
                  Malik Ahmed (an employee of Nadeem Iqbal) added me as  his
                  supervisor in February 2017  and  therefore  had  my  ACCA
                  number.  Although he added me he did not  actually  submit
                  any work experience for me to sign off.  So to date I have
                  not signed off any work experience for him.  This  is  one
                  possible explanation as to how my number came to appear on
                  the letter in question.

             j.   In short Document 14 is one the  purports  to  have  been
                  created and signed by me but this is entirely false.

         8.   I have no personal knowledge of Documents D1 to D13 that  also
             consist of what appears to be a letter from Douglas  Blake  (a
             colleague of mine who was employed by TaxAssist Direct Ltd and
             not by the franchisee) and related items.  From investigations
             conducted by TaxAssist Direct Ltd I am able to say that to the
             best of my own knowledge and belief this document was also not
             created by any TaxAssist Direct Ltd member of staff  including
             Douglas Blake.  Further D1  also  refers  to  Douglas  Blake's
             ICAEW membership that would not  normally  appear  on  letters
             drafted by us and, moreover, the inclusion  of  his  name  and
             details at the bottom right of the letter would never be  used
             as part of the letter head as it would imply  he  works  there
             when he does not.

         9.   I regard myself as  a  person  of  the  utmost  integrity  and
             honesty.  My name and accreditation  have  clearly  been  used
             without my knowledge.  I am  very  angry  and  upset  that  my
             details have been used without my  knowledge  or  consent  and
             also feel violated as a result of this."

27. At the hearing on 25 November 2019,  Ms  Skyring  adopted  her  witness
    statement.  Neither Mr Singh nor Mr Gajjar had  any  questions  to  ask
    her.  We are entirely satisfied that Ms Skyring is  a  wholly  credible
    witness.  We accept that, despite what is set out in the letter  of  25
    May 2017 at D14, Ms Skyring did not sign the letter.  Indeed,  she  had
    nothing at all to do with its composition.

E.  THE UPPER TRIBUNAL'S POWER TO SET ASIDE ITS DECISION

28. Mr Gajjar's skeleton argument on behalf of the appellant contended that
    the Upper Tribunal lacked jurisdiction to  re-open  the  appeal,  since
    rule 43  was  confined  to  procedural  errors.   Mr  Singh's  skeleton
    argument concurred:-

         "It should be recalled that this is not a situation where  a  party
         is seeking a set-aside,  and  the  question  of  "jurisdiction"  is
         conditional on whether any part of Rule 43 is arguably met  in  the
         eyes of the Tribunal.  That is the very issue in contemplation.  It
         is, however, the Secretary of State's view that  the  provision  of
         information to the Tribunal after the appeal has been  disposed  of
         cannot in any way be classified as a  procedural  irregularity  "in
         the proceedings".  The  proceedings  had  been  concluded  and  the
         Tribunal was functus  officio.   Whereas  subsequent  evidence  can
         potentially found an error of law by reason of error of fact,  that
         question can only be  considered  in  extant  proceedings.   It  is
         another matter whether the Secretary of State  may  in  due  course
         seek to act upon the ramifications of the allegation which has come
         to light."

(a) The respondent's ability to take action

29. There is a body of caselaw that considers the  circumstances  in  which
    the respondent may refuse to give effect to a  decision  of  (now)  the
    First-tier Tribunal or the Upper  Tribunal,  in  an  immigration  case,
    which has not been  disturbed  on  appeal,  on  the  basis  that  fresh
    evidence has come to light which shows that the Tribunal  was  deceived
    as to the facts of the case.  There is a detailed consideration of  the
    earlier cases in the judgment of McCombe LJ in  Ullah  v  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department [2019] EWCA Civ 550:-

         "22. Turning to the cases, the first case to which we were referred
             was R (Boafo) v Secretary of State for the Home Department (in
             later citations "SSHD") [2002] 1 WLR 1919.  There the SSHD had
             refused the claimant's  application  for  ILR.   The  claimant
             appealed successfully to an adjudicator, but  the  adjudicator
             failed to give directions as  to  the  implementation  of  the
             appeal  decision,  as  then  required  by   s.19(3)   of   the
             Immigration Act 1971.  The SSHD did  not  appeal  against  the
             adjudicator's decision but rather reconsidered the application
             in the light  of  fresh  information  and  again  refused  it,
             directing  the  claimant  to  leave  the  UK  forthwith.   The
             claimant's claim for judicial review was refused in  the  High
             Court, but her appeal was allowed in this  court.   The  court
             held that the absence of directions under s.19(3) of the  1971
             Act did not deprive  the  adjudicator's  decision  of  binding
             force and that, in the absence of an appeal by the  SSHD,  the
             adjudicator's decision was binding upon him and ILR had to  be
             granted.


         23.  There are two important  passages  for  our  purposes  in  the
             judgment of Auld LJ (with whom Ward LJ and  Robert  Walker  LJ
             (as he then was) agreed).  First, in paragraphs 25 and 26,  at
             p. 1927 D-G, Auld LJ said this:


                  "25. ...Nevertheless, it is  a  salutary  example  of  the
                      importance, as Rose  J  emphasised  in  Ex  p  Yousuf
                      [1989] Imm AR 554, 558, of the executive  making  use
                      of available machinery  of  appeal  when  seeking  to
                      challenge the decision of an adjudicator, rather than
                      attempting to  circumvent  it  by  reconsidering  the
                      matter, whether on evidence going to the original  or
                      new facts.  That is especially so where, as in a case
                      like  this,   any   fresh   executive   decision   is
                      unappealable save by way of judicial review.


                  26.  On the question whether, as  a  matter  of  law,  the
                      Secretary of State  was  entitled  to  disregard  the
                      adjudicator's  determination  and  to  consider   the
                      matter afresh  because  it  was  not  accompanied  by
                      directions, I take the first two propositions of  the
                      judge as  starting  points.   First,  this  appellate
                      machinery is one of review, not rehearing,  and  both
                      an adjudicator and the tribunal are normally bound to
                      determine appeals on the facts as they  were  at  the
                      date of the decision under challenge.   And,  second,
                      an unappealed decision of an adjudicator  is  binding
                      on the parties.  However, I disagree with  the  judge
                      in  his  decision  that  an  adjudicator's   decision
                      without directions is, by reason  of  their  absence,
                      not binding on the Secretary of  State  and  that  he
                      may, in consequence consider the matter afresh in the
                      light of new information."
             Secondly, in paragraph 28, at p. 1928, the Lord Justice said:
                  "28. There may be circumstances in which the executive may
                      reopen a decision without appealing  a  determination
                      of an adjudicator,  for  example,  because  there  is
                      fresh evidence, say of deception of  the  adjudicator
                      about the facts on which the challenged decision  was
                      based, or where, as in the entry clearance case of Ex
                      p Yousuf [1989] Imm AR 554 the  very  nature  of  the
                      second decision calls for decision on contemporaneous
                      facts.  But even in such cases, it would be wrong, in
                      my view, for the Secretary of State, as a generality,
                      to regard the matter as hinging on  the  presence  or
                      absence of directions."
             It was, of course, that second passage that was quoted in  the
             administrative review decision in the present case.
         24.  Next, there was the decision of Moses J (as he  then  was)  in
             Saribal v SSHD [2002] EWHC 1542 (Admin).  The outline facts of
             that case were stated by Moses J at paragraphs 1 and 2 of  his
             judgment as follows:


                  "1.  On 12th October 2000 the Immigration Appeal  Tribunal
                      allowed the claimant's appeal from a decision of  the
                      Special  Adjudicator,  given  on  28th  April   1999,
                      dismissing  the   claimant's   appeal   against   the
                      Secretary of State's refusal  to  grant  him  asylum.
                      Notwithstanding the successful outcome of his appeal,
                      the Secretary of State refused to grant the  claimant
                      refugee status or leave to remain.  On the  contrary,
                      on the 14th September 2001  the  Secretary  of  State
                      served him with notice of his decision to  deport  on
                      the basis that his presence in the United Kingdom  is
                      not conducive to the public good.


                  2.   The Secretary of State's decision was  based  on  the
                      ground that the favourable IAT decision was  obtained
                      by fraud, the evidence of which had not come  to  the
                      Secretary of State's attention until  after  the  IAT
                      hearing.  The claimant has appealed that decision but
                      contends that the Secretary of  State's  decision  to
                      issue the Notice of Intention to Deport  was  illegal
                      and irrational.  In essence, he asserts the Secretary
                      of State failed to ask himself the correct  questions
                      in relation to the evidential basis for setting aside
                      the decision of the IAT."


         25.  Moses J cited the two passages from Boafo which I have  quoted
             above. He then said (at paragraph 17):


                  "17. The  decision  in  ex  parte  Boafo  demonstrates  an
                      important   principle   at   the   heart   of   these
                      proceedings.  The Secretary of State is not  entitled
                      to disregard the determination of the IAT and  refuse
                      a claimant's right to indefinite leave to remain as a
                      refugee unless he can set aside that determination by
                      appropriate   procedure   founded   on    appropriate
                      evidence."
             He continued at paragraph 19 as follows:
                  "19. The Secretary of State has not sought to  appeal  the
                      IAT decision in the Court of Appeal on the  basis  of
                      the evidence before  the  IAT  at  the  time  of  its
                      determination.  Thus  he  can  only  impugn  the  IAT
                      decision on the basis  of  fresh  evidence  of  fraud
                      which  is  relevant,  credible  and  not   previously
                      available without due diligence  in  accordance  with
                      the  well  known  principles  enunciated  in  Ladd  v
                      Marshall [1954] 1 WLR 1489."


         26.  Moses J also cited Taylor v Lawrence [2002] EWCA Civ 90  in  a
             passage of Lord Woolf CJ's judgment in that  case  emphasising
             the importance of finality in litigation  and  said  that  the
             principles were no different in immigration cases.  He cited R
             v SSHD, ex  p.  Momin  Ali  [1984]  1  WLR  663  in  which  an
             application to adduce fresh evidence in the Court of Appeal in
             judicial review proceedings was refused on the ground that  it
             could not be shown that  the  evidence  could  not  have  been
             obtained with reasonable diligence for use at  the  trial.  In
             the Momin Ali case Sir John Donaldson  MR  (as  he  then  was)
             said:


                  "23. ...


                           Just as I think the doctrine  of  issue  estoppel
                           has, as such, no place in public law or  Judicial
                           Review.... so I think that the decision in Ladd v
                           Marshall has, as such, no place in that  context.
                           However  I  think  that  the   principles   which
                           underlay issue estoppel and the decision in  Ladd
                           v Marshall, namely  there  must  be  finality  in
                           litigation, are applicable, subject always to the
                           discretion of the Court to depart  from  them  if
                           the wider interests of justice so require."


         27.  There follows a passage of interest in  the  present  case  in
             which  the  SSHD  was  arguing  that   judicial   review   was
             inappropriate because that applicant had a right of appeal  to
             an adjudicator.  In contrast here, it is Ms  Naik  who  argues
             (beyond the range of her client's permission to  appeal)  that
             the  Respondent  should  have  agreed  to  the  issue  of  the
             Appellant's alleged fraud being remitted to  the  FTT  in  any
             appeal by the Appellant from any refusal of his  still  extant
             further claim for ILR based upon human rights considerations.


         28.  Moses J said that the parties before him did not  dispute  the
             principles of finality in litigation or those upon which fresh
             evidence  is  sometimes  admitted  upon   appeals   in   legal
             proceedings. He continued at  paragraphs  25  and  26  of  his
             judgment as follows:


                  "25. As I have said, neither party was disposed to dispute
                      these principles. There was, however a dispute as  to
                      the appropriate procedure.  There is  no  restriction
                      within the statute  on  the  issue  of  a  notice  of
                      intention to deport.  Once it has been issued, it  is
                      open to the claimant to  appeal  in  accordance  with
                      those provisions to which I  have  already  referred.
                      The Secretary of State submits that an appeal  to  an
                      adjudicator is a more convenient process.  It  avoids
                      duplication and a hearing before the adjudicator is a
                      more suitable forum for hearing  contested  evidence.
                      There is, indeed, judicial support for that  approach
                      in ex parte Momin Ali where  Sir  John  Donaldson  MR
                      said:-


                           "It is unfortunate that the  instant  application
                           has  arisen  in  circumstances   in   which   the
                           applicant  has  no  right   of   appeal   to   an
                           adjudicator, who  would  be  better  equipped  to
                           resolve the issues than is a  court."  (See  page
                           666).


                  26.  Mr Blake QC, on behalf of the claimant, accepted that
                      there would be cases where it is appropriate to issue
                      a Notice of Intention to Deport without first seeking
                      to set aside a determination either by an out of time
                      appeal or by Judicial Review.  Such a course would be
                      appropriate, he concedes,  where  fraud  is  admitted
                      after an IAT determination.  But in the instant  case
                      he contends that it is incumbent upon  the  Secretary
                      of State to ask  himself  the  correct  questions  in
                      relation to the nature of the evidence  on  which  he
                      relies  for  the  purpose  of   setting   aside   the
                      determination. ..."


         29.  In contrast, in Saribal, the claimant  did  have  a  right  of
             appeal to an adjudicator and Moses J referred to the  argument
             of counsel for the SSHD as follows (at paragraph 35):


                  "35.     Mr Kovats starts from the proposition that  since
                      there is nothing in the statute which  prohibits  the
                      issue of a notice an intention to deport, there is no
                      inhibition  on  the  Secretary  of  State  doing   so
                      providing only  that  he  asks  himself  the  correct
                      questions.   That  he  did  so  is  demonstrated   by
                      paragraph  30  of  Mr  Bentley's  witness  statement.
                      There is, he submits, no disadvantage to the claimant
                      in issuing such a notice.  Should  the  Secretary  of
                      State be unable to adduce the necessary  evidence  at
                      the hearing, an adjudicator on  appeal  can  so  rule
                      when he considers the Ladd  v  Marshall  tests  as  a
                      preliminary  issue  (see   Immigration   and   Asylum
                      Procedure Rules 2000, rule 30(4)(c)(i)).   There  is,
                      moreover, every advantage in  a  hearing  before  the
                      adjudicator  which   is   appropriate   for   hearing
                      contested evidence and avoids duplication."
             The judge continued in paragraphs 36 and 37 in these terms:
                  "36.  I  do  not  think  that  this  case  turns  on   the
                      appropriate forum for setting aside the determination
                      of the IAT.  But, to my mind it does turn on  whether
                      the Secretary of State asked himself those  questions
                      which are appropriate to the issue as to whether  the
                      determination can successfully  be  set  aside.   The
                      acceptance, on behalf of the Secretary of State, that
                      some questions  as  to  that  issue  must  be  asked,
                      carries  with  it  the  acceptance  that  it  is  not
                      sufficient merely to  form  a  view  that  there  are
                      grounds for issuing a Notice of Intention to  Deport;
                      he  must  also  consider  whether  the  evidence  for
                      supporting those  grounds  satisfies  the  principles
                      underlying  Ladd  v  Marshall.   If  it  were  merely
                      sufficient to issue the Notice and then hope that the
                      evidence will emerge by the time of  the  hearing  of
                      the appeal, then there  would  be  no  need  for  the
                      Secretary of State to consider  any  question  as  to
                      setting  aside  the  existing  determination.    But,
                      rightly, the Secretary of State has  not  adopted  so
                      insouciant a stance.  To do so would be to ignore the
                      determination.


                  37.  I start, accordingly from the position that,  in  the
                      light of the existence of  the  IAT's  determination,
                      the Secretary of State must consider the question  as
                      to whether the Ladd v Marshall tests are satisfied."


         30.  Moses J concluded that the  SSHD  had  not  addressed  himself
             sufficiently to the question of whether the principles in Ladd
             v Marshall had been satisfied in that case before deciding  to
             issue the Notice of Intention to Deport in a case where  there
             had been an earlier decision of the Tribunal.  He quashed  the
             decision.

         31.  This case is, therefore, High Court authority  to  the  effect
             that, in cases where there has  been  an  antecedent  Tribunal
             decision that an immigrant is entitled to ILR, in  considering
             whether to take action which has the effect  of  revoking  the
             leave, the SSHD must give proper attention to principles  akin
             to those identified for the admission  of  fresh  evidence  on
             appeals in legal proceedings, as set out in Ladd  v  Marshall.
             If he does not do so, his decision is liable to be  set  aside
             on judicial review.


         32.  That brings me to the decision in [Secretary of State for  the
             Home Department v TB [2008] EWCA Civ 997].  In that case,  the
             respondent  Jamaican  national  did  not  have  an  attractive
             immigration record and on 1 August 2003 in the Crown Court  at
             Guildford  he  pleaded  guilty  to  an  offence  of  supplying
             controlled drugs of class A (heroin and  crack  cocaine).   He
             was sentenced to four years and  three  months'  imprisonment,
             reduced on appeal to three years and ten months.   By  letters
             of 24 August and 28 September  2004  the  SSHD  signified  his
             intention to make a deportation order against the  respondent.
             The respondent claimed asylum and  alleged  that  his  removal
             would constitute breaches of  Articles  2,  3  and  8  of  the
             European Convention on Human Rights ("ECHR").  The  claim  was
             refused on 6 April 2005, without the SSHD contending that  the
             respondent was a danger  to  the  community  or  that  he  was
             excluded from the  benefit  of  Article  33.1  of  the  Asylum
             Convention.  The claim was rejected  on  credibility  grounds,
             and also, in any event, on the basis that there was no risk of
             harm to  him  on  return  to  Jamaica  and  further  that  any
             interference with his private and family life was justified.


         33.  There was an appeal to the  Asylum  and  Immigration  Tribunal
             ("AIT").  Again, no point as to danger to the community or  of
             exclusion from  the  benefit  of  the  Asylum  Convention  was
             argued.  The Immigration Judge allowed the appeal on the basis
             of all three of the  Articles  of  the  ECHR  upon  which  the
             respondent had relied.


         34.  The SSHD did not seek to have the AIT decision reconsidered or
             set aside. Instead,  on  25  January  2006  he  wrote  to  the
             respondent's solicitors raising the issues that the respondent
             posed a danger to the public and that he was properly excluded
             from  benefit  of  the  Asylum  Convention.   The  solicitors'
             response was that the  SSHD's  new  stance  was  an  abuse  of
             process in view of the fact that those  points  had  not  been
             raised at any stage up to and including the AIT decision.


         35.   In  the  Administrative  Court,  on  review  of  the   SSHD's
             subsequent decision to grant only limited 6 month  periods  of
             discretionary leave, instead of the 5 years normally  afforded
             to a refugee, Bean J (as he then was)  held  that  the  SSHD's
             decision was an abuse of process.  He founded his decision  on
             principles of finality in litigation:  Henderson  v  Henderson
             (1843) 3 Hare 100 and Johnson v Gore-Wood  [2002]  AC  1.   It
             seems, as recorded in this court's judgment  on  appeal,  that
             Bean J said that it was  incumbent  upon  the  SSHD  to  bring
             forward  his  entire  case  before  the  AIT  on  any  appeal:
             "Otherwise, the applicant is  relegated  to  seeking  judicial
             review of the Secretary of State's  decision...which  [counsel
             for the Secretary of  State]...realistically  accepted  was  a
             less advantageous remedy which would make  it  more  difficult
             for him to succeed."(Emphasis added in the argument of Ms Naik
             before us): see [2008] EWCA Civ 977 at paragraph 27.


         36.  This court dismissed the SSHD's appeal. Stanley Burnton LJ (in
             a judgment with which Rix  and  Thorpe  LJJ  agreed)  said  at
             paragraph 32 this:


                  "32. As a matter of principle, it cannot be right for  the
                      Home Secretary to be able to circumvent the  decision
                      of the IAT by administrative decision.  If she  could
                      do  so,  the  statutory  appeal   system   would   be
                      undermined; indeed, in a case such  as  the  present,
                      the  decision  of  the  Immigration  Judge   on   the
                      application of the Refugee Convention would  be  made
                      irrelevant.  That  would  be  inconsistent  with  the
                      statutory scheme."
             He then referred to R (Mersin) v SSHD [2000] EWHC 348  (Admin)
             and to Boafo (from the latter: "...an unappealed  decision  of
             an adjudicator is binding on the parties").   He  also  quoted
             the judgment of Moses J in Saribal  (supra)  at  paragraph  17
             (quoted above) where "the principle" was that the SSHD is  not
             entitled to disregard an adjudicator's decision "unless he can
             set aside that determination by appropriate procedure  founded
             on appropriate evidence".
         37.  There then followed the  important  paragraph,  paragraph  35,
             which was at the heart of the UT's decision in this  case  and
             of Singh LJ's limited permission to appeal order. At paragraph
             35 of TB, Stanley Burnton LJ said:


                  "35.  Of course, different considerations may apply  where
                      there  is  relevant  fresh  evidence  that  was   not
                      available at the date of the hearing, or a change  in
                      the law, and the principle has no  application  where
                      there is a change in circumstances or there  are  new
                      events after the date of the decision: see Auld LJ in
                      Boafo at [28]. But this is not such a case."


30. In Ullah itself, the court held, in the light of that earlier  caselaw,
    that the Ladd v Marshall requirements had to be satisfied where,  after
    the First-tier Tribunal had allowed an appeal  against  a  decision  to
    refuse to grant indefinite leave to remain, the respondent was informed
    by a third party that the original claim to indefinite leave to  remain
    had been fraudulent, in that it had been  obtained  under  a  different
    identity and that the individual concerned, in his true  identity,  had
    not been resident in the United Kingdom throughout  the  fourteen  year
    period that was then required in order to give rise to  a  decision  in
    his favour.

31.  The court dismissed the appellant's appeal against the decision of the
    Upper Tribunal, which had refused permission to bring  judicial  review
    proceedings against the respondent's decision to revoke  the  grant  of
    indefinite leave to  remain  that  had  resulted  from  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's allowing of the appeal.  McCombe LJ  (with  whom  the  other
    members of the court agreed) considered it clear "that the  UT  in  the
    present case reviewed the respondent's decision through  the  prism  of
    the Ladd v Marshall criterion".

(b) Takhar v Gracefield Developments Limited and others

32. After the hearing in Ullah, the Supreme Court gave judgment in Takhar v
    Gracefield Developments Limited and Others [2019] UKSC 13.  Mrs  Takhar
    claimed that certain properties had been transferred to Gracefield as a
    result of undue influence or other conscionable conduct on the part  of
    Dr and Mrs Krishan.  The High Court rejected Mrs Takhar's  claim.   The
    judge placed weight on the fact that the last page of a  version  of  a
    profit share agreement appeared to have  survived  in  the  form  of  a
    scanned copy, which bore Mrs Takhar's signature.  The original  of  the
    agreement had never been found.  Mrs Takhar sought permission to obtain
    evidence from a handwriting expert to  examine  the  signature  on  the
    document that had been adduced but that application was refused because
    it was not made until the trial was imminent.   At  trial,  Mrs  Takhar
    gave evidence that she could not say the signature was not hers but she
    was unable to explain how it had got there.

33. After the trial, Mrs Takhar's new solicitors obtained a report  from  a
    handwriting expert, who stated conclusively that the signature  on  the
    profit share agreement had been transposed from a letter  of  24  March
    2006 which had been sent to the solicitors acting for the Krishans.

34. On the strength of that report, Mrs Takhar issued proceedings  to  have
    the judgment of the High Court and its order set  aside  on  the  basis
    that these had been obtained by fraud.  On the trial of the preliminary
    issue of whether Mrs Takhar's claim amounted to an  abuse  of  process,
    Newey J held that a party who seeks to set  aside  a  judgment  on  the
    basis that it was obtained by fraud did not have to demonstrate that he
    could not have discovered the  fraud  by  the  exercise  of  reasonable
    diligence.  The claim was, accordingly, not an abuse of process.

35. The Court of Appeal disagreed.  Patten LJ held that the "due  diligence
    condition" needed to be satisfied.

36. The Supreme Court unanimously allowed Mrs Takhar's appeal  against  the
    judgment of the Court of Appeal and restored  the  order  of  Newey  J.
    Lord Kerr gave the leading judgment, with whom three other  members  of
    the seven-judge panel unequivocally agreed.  At paragraph 19, Lord Kerr
    examined the reliance placed by the Court of Appeal on the judgment  of
    Wigram VC in Henderson v Henderson (1843)  3  Hare  100  (mentioned  at
    paragraph 35 of McCombe LJ's judgment in Ullah: see above).  Lord  Kerr
    held, at paragraph 20, that although Henderson was  authority  for  the
    "general principle that parties must normally advance the  totality  of
    their case on the first bout of litigation" and that it was  "not  open
    to them, save in exceptional circumstances, to bring up a  point  which
    should have been raised  in  that  litigation  and  which  could,  with
    reasonable diligence, have been discovered and canvassed on  the  first
    trial", Henderson had nothing to say on whether  such  a  rule  applied
    "where the new point was not in issue between the parties on the  first
    trial and where, if it had been and evidence on the point had been led,
    a different outcome might have ensued"; nor "where the new issue raises
    an allegation of fraud by which, it is claimed, the original  judgement
    was obtained".

37. Lord Kerr found that there was nothing in the judgments of the  Supreme
    Court in Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd v Zodiac Seats  UK  Ltd  (formerly
    Contour Aerospace Ltd) [2014] AC 160 or the judgments of the  House  of
    Lords in Arnold v National Westminster Bank plc [1991]  2  AC  93  that
    precluded the course  taken  by  Newey  J.   In  this  regard,  it  was
    important that the "case before Judge Purle [in the High Court] did not
    involve an allegation of fraud on the part of the Krishans.  The points
    which "had to be or were decided" in Mrs  Takhar's  case  before  Judge
    Purle were not concerned with possible fraud" (paragraph 27).

38. At paragraphs 40 to 42, Lord Kerr rejected the reliance placed  by  the
    Court of Appeal on the judgments in Owens Bank Ltd v Etoile Commerciale
    SA [1995] 1 WLR 44 and Owens Bank Ltd v Bracco [1992] 2 AC 443  on  the
    basis that the rule to be derived from them -  namely  that  the  party
    alleging fraud must prove it by fresh evidence  not  available  at  the
    time and not discoverable with  reasonable  diligence  -  applied  only
    "where there is a proposed re-litigation of the issue  of  fraud  which
    has been determined  in  the  earlier  litigation.   That  is  not  the
    position here" (paragraph 42).

39. Beginning at paragraph 43, Lord Kerr examined the  authorities  to  the
    effect that fraud is "a thing apart" which does "unravels all":-

         "43. In HIH Casualty and General Insurance Ltd  v  Chase  Manhattan
             Bank [2003] 2 Lloyds Rep 61, para 15, Lord Bingham of Cornhill
             said that:
                  "... fraud is a thing apart.  This is not a  mere  slogan.
                  It also reflects an old legal rule that fraud unravels all
                  ...  once  fraud  is  proved,  'it   vitiates   judgments,
                  contracts  and  all  transactions   whatsoever':   Lazarus
                  Estates Ltd v Beasley [1956] 1 All ER 341 at 345, [1956] 1
                  QB 702 at 712 per Denning LJ.   Parties  entering  into  a
                  commercial contract will no doubt recognise and accept the
                  risk  of   errors   and   omissions   in   the   preceding
                  negotiations, even negligent errors  and  omissions.   But
                  each party will assume the honesty and good faith  of  the
                  other; absent such an assumption they would not deal."
         44.  This reflects the basic principle that the law does not expect
             people to arrange their affairs on the basis that  others  may
             commit fraud.  It also carries echoes of what Lord Wilberforce
             said in The Ampthill Peerage [1977] AC 547, 569:
                  "... any determination of disputable  fact  may,  the  law
                  recognises, be imperfect: the law aims  at  providing  the
                  best and safest  solution  ...  and  having  reached  that
                  solution it closes the book ... in the interest of  peace,
                  certainty and security it  prevents  further  inquiry  ...
                  there are cases where the certainty  of  justice  prevails
                  over the possibility of truth  ...  and  these  are  cases
                  where the law  insists  on  finality.   For  a  policy  of
                  closure to be compatible with justice, it must be attended
                  with safeguards: so the law allows appeals:  so  the  law,
                  exceptionally, allows appeals out  of  time:  so  the  law
                  still more exceptionally allows judgments to  be  attacked
                  on the ground of fraud."
         45.  This passage from Lord  Wilberforce's  speech  resonates  with
             earlier authority.  In Hip Foong Hong v H Neotia &  Co  [1918]
             AC 888, 894, Lord Buckmaster said:
                  "In all applications  for  a  new  trial  the  fundamental
                  ground must be  that  there  has  been  a  miscarriage  of
                  justice.  If no charge of fraud  or  surprise  is  brought
                  forward, it is not  sufficient  to  show  that  there  was
                  further evidence that could have been adduced  to  support
                  the claim of the losing parties;  the  applicant  must  go
                  further and show that the evidence was of such a character
                  that it would, so far as can be foreseen,  have  formed  a
                  determining factor in the result.  Such considerations  do
                  not apply to questions of  surprise,  and  still  less  to
                  questions of  fraud.   A  judgment  that  is  tainted  and
                  affected by fraudulent conduct is tainted throughout,  and
                  the whole must fail ..."
         46.  The clear implication from this statement is that in cases  of
             fraud, unlike  other  instances  of  claimed  miscarriages  of
             justice, it is not necessary to show that the further evidence
             would have been a determining factor in the result.   And,  if
             it was not necessary to show that, it  could  hardly  be  said
             that it would have to be shown  that  evidence  of  the  fraud
             could not have been obtained before the  first  trial  by  the
             exercise of reasonable diligence (a more rigorous requirement,
             by any standard).
         47.  A need to show reasonable diligence did not feature in Jonesco
             v Beard [1930] AC 298, where an application was  made  to  set
             aside a judgment obtained by fraud. At p 300, Lord  Buckmaster
             said
                  "the proper method of impeaching a completed  judgment  on
                  the ground of fraud is by action in which, as in any other
                  action based on fraud, the particulars of the  fraud  must
                  be exactly given and the allegations  established  by  the
                  strict proof such a charge requires."
         No mention was made of a need to show that evidence  of  the  fraud
         could not have been uncovered by reasonable diligence. If that  was
         deemed to be a requirement, it would surely have been mentioned  at
         this point.  This is particularly so because affidavits relating to
         evidence other than fraud, which  had  not  been  produced  at  the
         trial, were said by Lord Buckmaster not to be capable of sustaining
         the case for setting aside  the  judgment  because  "there  was  no
         sufficient explanation of  why  the  evidence  had  not  been  made
         available at the trial" (at p 300).  The  same  stricture  was  not
         applied to the argument in relation to fraud."
40. Having examined caselaw from Australia and Canada to the  same  effect,
    Lord Kerr reached the following conclusions:-

         "54. For the reasons that I have given, I do not consider that  the
             Etoile and Bracco cases  are  authority  for  the  proposition
             that, in cases  where  it  is  alleged  that  a  judgment  was
             obtained by fraud, it may only be set aside  where  the  party
             who makes that application  can  demonstrate  that  the  fraud
             could not have been uncovered  with  reasonable  diligence  in
             advance of the obtaining of the judgment.  If,  however,  they
             have that effect, I consider that they should not be followed.
              In my view, it ought now to be recognised that where  it  can
             be shown that a judgment has been obtained by fraud, and where
             no allegation of fraud had been raised at the trial which  led
             to that judgment, a requirement of reasonable diligence should
             not be imposed on the party seeking to set aside the judgment.
         55.  Two qualifications to that general conclusion should be  made.
             Where fraud has been raised at  the  original  trial  and  new
             evidence as to the existence of the fraud is prayed in aid  to
             advance a case for setting aside the judgment, it seems to  me
             that it can be argued that the court having to deal with  that
             application  should  have  a  discretion  as  to  whether   to
             entertain the application.  Since that question does not arise
             in the present appeal, I do not express any final view on  it.
             The  second  relates  to  the  possibility   that,   in   some
             circumstances, a deliberate decision may have been  taken  not
             to investigate the possibility of  fraud  in  advance  of  the
             first trial, even if that had been suspected.  If  that  could
             be established, again, I believe that a discretion whether  to
             allow an application  to  set  aside  the  judgment  would  be
             appropriate but, once more, I express no  final  view  on  the
             question.  In Mrs Takhar's case, she did  suspect  that  there
             may have been fraud but it is clear that she did  not  make  a
             conscious decision not to investigate it.   To  the  contrary,
             she sought permission to engage  an  expert  but,  as  already
             explained, this application was refused.
         56.  At para 26 of his judgment, Newey J said that  the  principles
             which govern applications to set aside judgments for fraud had
             been summarised by Aikens LJ in Royal Bank of Scotland  plc  v
             Highland Financial Partners lp [2013] 1  CLC  596,  para  106.
             There, Aikens LJ said:
                  "The principles are, briefly: first, there  has  to  be  a
                  'conscious and deliberate dishonesty' in relation  to  the
                  relevant evidence given, or action taken,  statement  made
                  or matter concealed, which is relevant to the judgment now
                  sought to be impugned.  Secondly, the  relevant  evidence,
                  action, statement or concealment (performed with conscious
                  and deliberate dishonesty) must be 'material'.  'Material'
                  means that the fresh evidence that is  adduced  after  the
                  first judgment has been given is such that it demonstrates
                  that the previous relevant evidence, action, statement  or
                  concealment was an operative cause of the court's decision
                  to give judgment in the way it did.  Put another  way,  it
                  must be shown that the fresh evidence would have  entirely
                  changed the way in which the first  court  approached  and
                  came to its decision.  Thus  the  relevant  conscious  and
                  deliberate dishonesty must be causative  of  the  impugned
                  judgment being obtained in the terms it was.  Thirdly, the
                  question of materiality of the fresh  evidence  is  to  be
                  assessed by  reference  to  its  impact  on  the  evidence
                  supporting the original decision, not by reference to  its
                  impact on what decision might be made if the claim were to
                  be retried on honest evidence."
         57.  I agree that these are the relevant principles to be  applied.
             I also agree with Newey J's view (expressed at para 47 of  his
             judgment) that Mrs  Takhar's  application  to  set  aside  the
             judgment  of  Judge  Purle  has  the  potential  to  meet  the
             requirements which Aikens LJ  outlined.   She  should  not  be
             fixed with a further obligation to show that the  fraud  which
             she now alleges could not  have  been  discovered  before  the
             original trial by reasonable diligence on her part."
41. Lord Sumption, agreeing with Lord Kerr, added some observations of  his
    own "because the disorderly state of the authorities is apt to make the
    question  before  us  appear  more  complicated  than  it  really   is"
    (paragraph 59).  Lord Sumption considered an action  to  set  aside  an
    earlier judgement for fraud "is not  a  procedural  application  but  a
    cause of action" (paragraph 60).  It "is independent of  the  cause  of
    action asserted in the earlier proceedings.  It relates to the  conduct
    of  the  earlier  proceedings  and  not  to  the  underlying   dispute"
    (paragraph 61).  That meant there could be  no  question  of  cause  of
    action estoppel.  The rule in Henderson v Henderson, although -

         "commonly treated as a branch of  the  law  of  res  judicata"  was
         "better  analysed  as  part  of  the   juridically   distinct   but
         overlapping principle which empowers the court to  restrain  abuses
         of process ...  Whereas res judicata is a rule of substantive  law,
         abuse of process is a concept which informs  the  exercise  of  the
         court's  procedural  powers.   These  are   part   of   the   wider
         jurisdiction of the court to protect its process from wasteful  and
         potentially oppressive duplicative litigation even in  cases  where
         the relevant question was not raised  or  decided  on  the  earlier
         occasion."  (paragraph 62).

42. At paragraph 63, Lord Sumption held that -

         "... the basis on which the  law  unmakes  transactions,  including
         judgments, which have been procured by fraud is that  a  reasonable
         person is entitled to assume honesty in those with whom  he  deals.
         He is not expected to conduct himself or his affairs on the footing
         that other persons are dishonest unless he  knows  that  they  are.
         That is why it is not a defence to an action in deceit to say  that
         the victim of the deceit was foolish or negligent to allow  himself
         to be taken in."

43. Lord Sumption concluded his judgment as follows:-

         "66. I would leave open the question whether the position as I have
             summarised it is any different where the fraud was  raised  in
             the earlier proceedings but  unsuccessfully.   My  provisional
             view is that the position is the same, for the  same  reasons.
             If decisive new evidence is deployed to establish  the  fraud,
             an action to set aside the judgment will lie  irrespective  of
             whether it could reasonably have been deployed on the  earlier
             occasion unless a deliberate decision was then  taken  not  to
             investigate or rely on the material.
         67.  I recognise the risk of frivolous or extravagant litigation to
             set aside judgments on the ground of  fraud,  but  like  other
             members of the court, I think that  the  stringent  conditions
             set out by Aikens LJ in Royal Bank of Scotland plc v  Highland
             Financial Partners lp [2013] 1 CLC  596,  para  106,  combined
             with the professional duties of counsel, are  enough  keep  it
             within acceptable limits. I do not think that  the  imposition
             of further conditions  would  be  consistent  with  the  long-
             standing policy of equity of reversing  transactions  procured
             by fraud."
(c) The respondent's powers to take action, following Takhar
44. It is, of course, important to recognise that Takhar involved  a  civil
    action between individuals, rather than public law proceedings, such as
    an appeal under the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002.   It
    is,  nevertheless,  doubtful   whether   the   "reasonable   diligence"
    requirement in Ladd v Marshall should now be held to apply, in  a  case
    where the Secretary of State has lost an appeal under the 2002 Act,  in
    circumstances where she has not raised the issue of fraud, but where it
    later transpires that fraud has been  employed,  such  as  occurred  in
    Ullah.

45.  So far as concerns an appeal that involves an allegation of dishonesty
    in relation to paragraph 322(5), the position may be  less  clear  cut.
    It would seem that, in such a case, we are in  the  realm  of  judicial
    discretion, of the kind described by  Lord  Kerr  at  paragraph  55  of
    Takhar.  If so, then a relevant  criterion  for  exercising  discretion
    might be the inability to have discovered the  fraud,  with  reasonable
    diligence; although paragraph 66 of Lord Sumption's judgment (with whom
    three of his colleagues agreed) leaves the matter in some doubt.

(d) The scope of rule 43

46. Interesting though they are, these questions are not for  determination
    in the present case.  The question for us concerns what light, if  any,
    the caselaw sheds on the ability of the Upper Tribunal to  invoke  rule
    43 where it appears that evidence relied upon by  the  Tribunal  in  an
    appeal was forged or is otherwise bogus.

47. The first point to make is that an application under rule  43(3)  by  a
    party is not a pre-condition of the Tribunal's power to set aside under
    rule 43(1).  If that had been the legislature's intention,  rule  43(1)
    would have said so.  The Tribunal may, accordingly, apply  rule  43  of
    its own motion.

48. The second point is that,  contrary  to  Mr  Gajjar's  submission,  the
    decision of Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Chamberlain, on  the  re-making
    of the appeal, was a decision that disposed of the proceedings  in  the
    Upper Tribunal. The fact that an appeal could be made to the  Court  of
    Appeal, with permission granted either by the Upper  Tribunal  or  that
    court, in no way affects the character of the Deputy Judge's  decision.



49. Thirdly, the caselaw, culminating in Ullah, makes  it  plain  that  the
    respondent can,  in  certain  circumstances,  respond  to  the  fact  a
    Tribunal may have been deceived into allowing an appeal, otherwise than
    by seeking to have the Tribunal's decision  overturned  or  set  aside.
    But that ability on the part of the respondent does not mean the  ambit
    of rule 43(1) is thereby restricted, so as  to  preclude  the  Tribunal
    from taking  action  to  set  aside  its  own  decision.   Rather,  the
    respondent's ability to act in such a matter will be a factor  for  the
    Upper Tribunal  to  consider  in  deciding,  in  the  exercise  of  its
    discretion, whether its decision should be set aside.

50. Fourthly, the submissions of Mr Gajjar and  Mr  Singh  that  the  Upper
    Tribunal has no power to act, even where it appears that fraud "was  an
    operative cause of the [Tribunal's] decision to give  judgment  in  the
    way it did" (Takhar,  paragraph  56)  sit  very  ill  indeed  with  the
    judgments in Takhar and the earlier caselaw  that  "fraud  is  a  thing
    apart", which "unravels all", vitiating "judgments, contracts  and  all
    transactions whatsoever" (Takhar, paragraph 43).

51. Both representatives submitted that, even  if  Ms Skyring's  name  and
    signature on the letter were bogus, rule 43 was not engaged because the
    proffering of that evidence was not a "procedural irregularity  in  the
    proceedings" within the meaning of section 43(2)(d).   We  emphatically
    reject  those  submissions.   Any  issue  as  to  what  constitutes   a
    "procedural irregularity" falls to be determined by reference  to  rule
    2.  Rule 2(1) states that the overriding objective of the Rules "is  to
    enable the Upper Tribunal to deal with cases fairly and justly".   Rule
    2(3) states that the Upper Tribunal "must seek to give  effect  to  the
    overriding objective when it ... (b) interprets any  rule  or  practice
    direction".

52.  Having regard to the overriding objective, it would be wholly inimical
    to the status of the Upper Tribunal, as a superior court of record,  if
    it were to be powerless to correct an abuse of its own process, of  the
    kind with which we may be concerned.  Although it was  dealing  with  a
    cause of action to set aside a judgement, the Supreme Court  in  Takhar
    regarded fraud as relating to "the conduct of the earlier  proceedings,
    and not to the underlying dispute" (paragraph  61).   A  case  that  is
    advanced by reference to evidence that turns out to be forged  involves
    an irregularity in the Tribunal's process.

53. The correctness of that finding can be tested as follows. If, say,  the
    Tribunal hears evidence from the spouse of  an  individual,  who  gives
    evidence in support of that individual in an Article 8 appeal,  and  it
    later transpires that the person giving the evidence was  an  imposter,
    it is plain that rules 2(3)(b) and 43(2)(d) enable the  Upper  Tribunal
    to correct what has been a serious abuse of process, resulting from the
    use of the imposter.  By the same token, the Upper  Tribunal  must,  in
    our view, be able to set aside a  decision  taken  by  reference  to  a
    document put in evidence purporting to come from an individual who  has
    in truth had nothing to do with it.

54. In conclusion on this aspect, rule 43 enables the Upper Tribunal to set
    aside a decision and to re-make that decision  where  the  Tribunal  is
    satisfied that (as summarised by Aikens LJ in Royal  Bank  of  Scotland
    plc v Highland Financial Partners LP)  there  has  been  conscious  and
    deliberate dishonesty in relation to evidence given  to  the  Tribunal,
    which was material to the Tribunal's decision: Takhar, paragraph 56.

55. The Upper Tribunal  must,  however,  consider  whether  it  is  in  the
    interests of justice to set aside the decision.  In that  regard,  each
    case will  be  fact  and  context-specific.   Amongst  the  matters  of
    potential relevance will be the existence and/or nature of the  party's
    involvement in the malfeasance; whether the malfeasance  is,  or  could
    be, the subject of an appeal; and whether it  could  result  in  action
    being taken by the Secretary of State to cancel  or  revoke  any  leave
    that might fall to be granted  in  the  light  of  the  decision  (see,
    however, paragraph 60 below).

(e)  The accountants' letter of 4 November 2019

56. Mr Gajjar submitted that  TaxAssist  Accountants  of  390  Hoe  Street,
    Walthamstow had, in fact, provided  an  innocent  explanation  for  the
    letter of 25  May  2017,  purporting  to  be  from  Ms  Skyring.   This
    explanation is said to have been given in a  letter  dated  4  November
    2019.  The letter reads as follows:-

         "To Whom It May Concern

         Re: Mr Muhammad Kamran Abbasi

         Dear Sir/Madam

         This is in relation to our  client's  query  regarding  the  letter
         issued to him on 25.05.2017 from our office under reference KAM001.



         I the undersigned confirm that  TaxAssist  Accountants  Walthamstow
         have a membership and do  practice  under  Institute  of  Financial
         Accountants Practicing Licence No: 245404 and  we  are  part  of  a
         Franchise Network namely TaxAssist Accountants.  We held our office
         at 390 Hoe street London E17 9AA (sic).

         I can confirm that the letter in question dated  25  May  2017  was
         issued from our franchise office by one of our  senior  accountants
         at 390 Hoe Street London E17 9AA to Mr Muhammad Kamran Abbasi.

         It is important to mention here that Ms Samantha Skyring is a  part
         of Franchisor Technical  team  for  200  franchisees  of  TaxAssist
         Accountants, whose name was mentioned in the aforementioned letter.
          In fact, it was issued on behalf of our  franchise;  nevertheless,
         it shows Ms Skyring's name who does not directly sign the letter of
         engagement with our clients.  She would have known  Mr  Abbasi,  if
         Home Office would have referred her  that the query is with regards
         to the franchise based in Walthamstow at 390 Hoe street London  E17
         9AA where client record is held (sic).

         Should you have any further queries, please feel free to contact us
         at local franchise office at Walthamstow 390 Hoe street London  E17
         9AA and we will be pleased to assist.

         Yours faithfully

57. Mr Gajjar informed us at the  hearing  that  TaxAssist  Accountants  of
    Walthamstow had been asked by  those  instructing  him  if  they  would
    attend the hearing but they had not done so.  Mr Gajjar said  he  would
    have liked to have an opportunity to call the relevant person  to  give
    evidence.

58. We duly note this.  As matters stand, the letter of 4 November 2019 is,
    on its face, manifestly  problematic.   It  fails  to  explain  why  Ms
    Skyring's name and ACCA membership number occur  at  the  foot  of  the
    letter of 25 May 2017, underneath the signature.  It is  manifest  that
    whoever wrote the letter of 25 May 2017 intended it to be  regarded  as
    having been written by Ms Skyring.  That is precisely how Deputy Upper
    Tribunal  Judge  Chamberlain  regarded  it.   We  accept  Ms  Skyring's
    unchallenged evidence that she does not  know  the  appellant.   It  is
    unclear why the writer of the letter of 4 November 2019 thinks  it  was
    the responsibility of the respondent to have referred  anything  to  Ms
    Skyring.  The letter of 25 May 2017 is now said to  have  been  "issued
    from our franchise office by one of our senior  accountants".   We  are
    not told, however, who that is.  The  letter  of  4 November  2019  is
    signed by Mansoor Ahmed.  His status in the  organisation  is  unknown.
    The sole director is still, according to foot  of  the  letter,  Nadeem
    Iqbal.

59. As matters stand, the position is,  in  short,  highly  unsatisfactory.
    However, notwithstanding that, for the reasons we have given,  rule  43
    would otherwise have been available  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  to  make
    relevant findings and, in the light of them, to decide whether  to  set
    aside the decision of the Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge,  it  is  now  no
    longer possible to deploy that power.  The reason  is  that,  following
    receipt of Deputy Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Chamberlain's  decision,  the
    respondent on 21 October 2019 granted the appellant indefinite leave to
    remain.  This was nine days before the Upper Tribunal sent  its  notice
    of hearing and directions, drawing attention to  the  information  from
    the TaxAssist Group that Samantha Skyring had not written the letter of
    25 May 2017.

F. ABANDONMENT OF THE APPEAL

60. The consequence of the grant of leave is that on 21  October  2019  the
    appellant's human rights appeal ceased to exist.   Section  104(4A)  of
    the 2002 Act provides as follows:-

         "(4A)    An appeal under section 82(1) brought by a person while he
                is in the United Kingdom shall be treated  as  abandoned  if
                the appellant is granted leave to enter  or  remain  in  the
                United Kingdom ...".

61. The effect of section 104(4A) is to terminate the jurisdiction  of  the
    Upper  Tribunal.   Since  the  appeal  of  the  appellant  against  the
    respondent's decision  to  refuse  his  human  rights  claim  has  been
    abandoned, the Upper Tribunal cannot invoke rule 43(1) in order to  re-
    make the decision in that appeal.

62. The upshot is that it will be for the respondent to  decide,  what,  if
    any, investigations to make and, in  the  light  thereof,  whether  she
    considers grounds exist for revoking the appellant's  indefinite  leave
    to remain in the United Kingdom.

G.   EVIDENCE FROM ACCOUNTANTS IN PARAGRAPH 322(5) CASES

63. Both the First-tier  Tribunal  and  the  Upper  Tribunal  have  seen  a
    considerable number of human rights appeals stemming from  the  refusal
    of the respondent of  indefinite  leave  to  remain,  by  reference  to
    paragraph 322(5).  In many such appeals, appellants have sought to  lay
    the  blame  for  discrepancies  in  disclosed  earnings  provided   to,
    respectively, the respondent and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs,  at
    the  door  of  their  accountants.   As  in  the  present  case,  those
    accountants have frequently written "To whom it  may  concern"  letters
    acknowledging responsibility for what are often large discrepancies.

64. We consider that  particularly  where,  as  in  the  present  case,  an
    accountant's letter is clearly perfunctory ("... we inadvertently mixed
    earnings details of two clients ...  The  client  was  compensated  ...
    Errors and mistakes can't be ruled out"), the  First-tier  Tribunal  or
    Upper Tribunal, as the case may be, should  expect  the  accountant  in
    question to attend the hearing, having provided in advance a  Statement
    of Truth, in order to explain in detail the circumstances in which  the
    error came to be made; the basis and nature of  any  compensation;  and
    whether the firm's insurers and/or any relevant  regulatory  body  have
    been informed.  In the  absence  of  such  evidence,  the  Tribunal  is
    unlikely to be able to place any material weight  on  letters  of  this
    kind.
