                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision  of  Judge
    Cox made following hearing at Bradford on 1st May 2014.

Background

 2. The claimants are national of Pakistan.  The first claimant entered the
    UK on 18th September 2007 as a work permit holder and was joined by his
    family on 11th August 2010.  Further applications for leave  to  remain
    were made until, on  14th  December  2012,  the  Sponsor  Licence  Unit
    informed UKBA that claimant's employers had had their  Sponsor  licence
    revoked.  A decision was  made  to  curtail  the  claimants'  leave  to
    remain.

 3. On 9th March 2013 they applied for indefinite leave to remain as Tier 2
    (General) Migrant and dependants. On 3rd October 2013 they were refused
    and their appeal came before Judge Cox. In a detailed determination the
    judge concluded  that  the  first  claimant  had  failed  to  meet  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules and that the Secretary of State's
    decision was in accordance with the law.  However he concluded,  having
    regard to the situation of the family as a whole, and in particular the
    third claimant, who was about to sit her GCSEs, that  the  decision  to
    remove was disproportionate in respect  of  her.  He  observed  that  a
    limited period of discretionary leave would be  appropriate  to  enable
    the third claimant to sit her exams.

 4. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal that aspect  of  the
    judge's decision, submitting that the  judge  had  failed  to  consider
    whether her circumstances were exceptional or compelling and failed  to
    follow the guidance Nasim and Others (Article 8) [2014] UKUT  25  which
    states:

         "The opportunity for a promising student to complete his course  in
         this country however desirable in general terms  is  not  itself  a
         right protected under Article 8."

 5. Permission to appeal was granted for the reasons stated in the  grounds
    by Judge Kamara on 5th June 2014.

The Hearing

 6. There was no  appearance  by  the  claimant.   Mrs  Petersen,  for  the
    Secretary of State, stated  that  she  understood  that  he  had  found
    another sponsor and intended to make a  fresh  application,  which  was
    perhaps the reasons for the non-attendance.  She relied on her  grounds
    and asked me to reverse the decision.





Conclusions

 7. The grounds are correct.  The fact that the third claimant was about to
    sit exams is not a proper basis for allowing the appeal  on  Article  8
    grounds.  It may be a  matter  for  the  Secretary  of  State  and  her
    residual discretion but that is not justiciable by  the  judge.   Since
    the exams have now taken place, there can in any event be no basis  for
    remaking the decision in the family's favour.

Decision

 8. The original judge erred in law.   The  decision  is  set  aside.   The
    claimants' appeals are dismissed.
