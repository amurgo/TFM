Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Scott, Counsel for Howe & Co Solicitors,
Brentford
For the Respondent:    Mr Tarlow, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Gambia born  on  12  December  1995.   He
    appealed against the decision  of  the  respondent  dated  8  May  2015
    refusing his application for leave to remain in the United  Kingdom  on
    human rights grounds.  His appeal was heard and dismissed by  Judge  of
    the First-tier Tribunal Asjad on 25 January  2016.   The  decision  was
    promulgated on 8 February 2016.

 2. An application for permission to appeal was lodged and  permission  was
    granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Kelly on 15 July 2016.  The
    permission states that in Ground 3 of the grounds of application  there
    is an arguable  error  of  law.   It  is  on  this  ground  only,  that
    permission  was  granted.   Ground  3  refers  to  the  fact  that  the
    appellant's father  has  fallen  foul  of  the  dictatorial  regime  of
    President Jammeh and has claimed asylum and the appellant would  suffer
    discrimination on return to the Gambia as the son of a man regarded  as
    a political opponent.  The ground states that the  judge  was  mistaken
    when she found that there would be no very  serious  obstacles  to  the
    appellant's integration into the country to which he would have  to  go
    if he required to leave the  UK  and  Paragraph  276ADE(1)(vi)  of  the
    Immigration Rules applies.  The permission  states  that  this  may  be
    relevant to the obstacles the appellant would face in reintegrating  in
    Gambia. It states that  although  the  appellant  raised  this  in  the
    penultimate sentence of his witness statement,  the  Tribunal  did  not
    consider it.

 3. The Rule 24 response  states  that  the  respondent  does  not  have  a
    decision for this appeal so no comment can be made on whether errors of
    law have been made by the First-tier Tribunal Judge.

The Hearing

 4. Counsel for the appellant  submitted  a  skeleton  argument.   He  also
    wished to submit further documents for me to consider.  These consisted
    of the case of Miah and Others [2012] EWCA Civ  261,  the  case  of  SS
    Congo and Others [2015]  INLR  683  [2015],  the  Home  Office  Country
    Information and Guidance on Gambia -  "Opposition  to  the  Government"
    dated December 2015 and Gambia Travel Advice dated 17  August  2016.  I
    found that these documents could not be accepted as evidence because of
    their late submission.  Counsel submitted that risk on return  has  not
    been considered by the First-tier Tribunal Judge so  this  evidence  is
    necessary,  particularly  relating  to  whether   the   appellant   can
    reintegrate into Gambia.  I discussed the matter  with  the  Presenting
    Officer who was prepared, if given time, to consider these papers.   It
    was agreed that the case would  be  delayed  until  2pm  to  allow  the
    Presenting Officer to do this.

 5. Counsel made his submissions on paragraph 276ADE of the Rules.   I  was
    referred to his skeleton argument and he  submitted  that  276ADE(1)(i)
    and (ii) have been made out but the appellant falls  between  paragraph
    276ADE(1) (iv) and (v).  He submitted that because of this it would  be
    disproportionate to dismiss his appeal.

 6. I was referred to the said case of Miah and Others at paragraph 16.  He
    submitted that this states that when  assessing  proportionality  under
    Article 8, the decision maker has to take into account  the  extent  to
    which the  claimant  falls  within  the  spirit  or  rationale  of  the
    concession even if not "within its precise letter".  He submitted  that
    this must  apply  to  this  appellant  as  he  falls  between  these  2
    subparagraphs of the Rules.  Counsel submitted that the  case  of  Miah
    states that if the Secretary of State wished  the  Rules  to  be  black
    letter law, she needs to achieve this  by  an  established  legislative
    route.  It must be operated in conformity with the  Human  Rights  Act.
    Counsel submitted that although the  Immigration  Rules  appear  to  be
    determinative, they are not.  They lead to a balancing  exercise  under
    Article 8.

 7. Counsel referred me to his skeleton argument and paragraph  17  of  the
    decision.  I established that the appellant's father is still in prison
    and his sister is actually his half-sister.

 8. I was referred to the case of Huang [2007] UKHL11 and Counsel submitted
    that I must review  the  First-tier  decision  and  consider  the  full
    background of the case.  He submitted that for the appellant to succeed
    inside the Immigration Rules there do not  require  to  be  exceptional
    circumstances.  He referred me to the said case of SS Congo and  Others
    at paragraph 29.  He submitted that  this  appellant  has  private  and
    family life in the United Kingdom but has  nobody  in  Gambia.   I  was
    referred to paragraph 58 of SS Congo and Others.  Counsel  referred  to
    the near miss aspect of this claim.  At paragraph 12  of  the  skeleton
    argument the appellant's history is set out.  Counsel pointed out  that
    this appellant has been in the  United  Kingdom  for  a  slightly  less
    period than the 7 year time frame required.  He submitted that  had  he
    applied for indefinite leave to remain in 6 months time, he would  have
    been in the United Kingdom for 7 years.  He submitted that he  is  over
    the age of 19 and under the age of 25 and he submitted that on 18 April
    2018 he will have spent more than  half  of  his  life  in  the  United
    Kingdom.

 9. Counsel pointed out  that  there  is  a  lacuna  in  paragraph  276ADE.
    Individuals who arrive on or after their 11th  birthday  can  never  be
    eligible under 276ADE(1)(v) and those who arrive after  they  turn  12�
    cannot become eligible under 276ADE(1)(v).   Those  who  arrive  before
    their 11th birthday can become eligible  under  (iv)  and  (v)  but  he
    submitted that this penalises disproportionately individuals who arrive
    when they are  aged  between  11  and  12�  and  this  applies  to  the
    appellant.  He submitted that there appears to be no clear  legislative
    purpose to this.  Effective immigration control has  to  be  considered
    but that is not enough.

10. Counsel submitted that when the appellant came to the United Kingdom he
    came with his father who  was  First  Secretary  at  the  Gambian  High
    Commission.  His half sister Mary came with them.   He  submitted  that
    because of his father's job there was no immigration  control  required
    and there was no final date for  the  appellant  to  leave  the  United
    Kingdom as he would be able to stay until  his  father  was  no  longer
    employed by the Gambian Embassy.  He  submitted  that  it  is  not  the
    appellant's fault that he no longer has leave to remain in  the  United
    Kingdom.  He submitted that this appellant has assimilated himself into
    the United Kingdom and is a victim of circumstance.  He submitted  that
    there is no specific reason for the Immigration Rules  to  deny  him  a
    right to remain in the United Kingdom.

11. I was referred to the appellant's most  recent  statement  and  Counsel
    submitted that this appellant has family life in the United Kingdom  as
    his half sister, Mary, who is still a minor, is in the  United  Kingdom
    and is regularising her immigration  status.   He  submitted  that  his
    mother has died and his father is now in custody.  He submitted that it
    cannot be said that it would not be in the public interest to let  this
    appellant remain in the United Kingdom and  he  has  a  close  familial
    relationship here.  He pointed  out  paragraph  14  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge's decision.  The judge states that while  the  appellant
    has a stepmother and half sister in the UK they  live  in  a  different
    town and he has limited contact "to such an extent I find that he  does
    not even know what his half sister's status is in the United  Kingdom."
    Counsel submitted that it was up to me what weight I give to  this.   I
    was told that his half sister lives in Enfield with  a  lady  who  they
    call aunt, who is not a real aunt.

12. Counsel submitted that the appellant has made it clear that  he  has  a
    strong private life in the UK.  Fulham Football Club are interested  in
    him.  He has an ability to work and there is a strong  indication  that
    he will work.  He submitted that this right to work engages Article  8.
    He submitted that this strong private life has to be taken into account
    when Article 8 is considered.

13. I was then asked  to  consider  the  risk  element  to  this  appellant
    returning to Gambia.  In  the  appellant's  most  recent  statement  he
    states "My father is serving a  prison  sentence  here  in  the  United
    Kingdom on account of issues that arose of importing  tobacco  and  the
    tax due on it.  As a consequence my father's trial was well  documented
    in the Gambia, reported in newspapers and I am  sure  would  have  been
    reported on the television but I have no idea whether that happened  or
    not.   I believe the President has  a  history  of  taking  retribution
    against the people who bring the Gambian government into  disrepute  or
    are deemed to be in opposition to the President and  that  families  of
    such people are targeted."  Counsel  submitted  that  this  appellant's
    life could well be in danger on return.  I asked if there had been  any
    evidence before the judge apart from  the  appellant's  oral  evidence,
    that this was in the newspapers in Gambia  or  on  the  television  but
    there had not.  I was referred to the Country Information and  Guidance
    on Gambia "Opposition to the Government " document.   At  2.2.1  it  is
    stated that President Jammeh's party dominates the political  landscape
    and that opposition  party  members  are  often  obstructed  and  those
    involved in political canvassing  face  the  possibility  of  arbitrary
    arrest and detention.  I asked if the appellant's  father  is  seen  as
    being in opposition to the government and Counsel submitted  that  that
    is how the government in Gambia will look at this.  At  2.2.2  of  this
    document reference is made to individuals  who  publicly  or  privately
    criticise the government.  These people may be detained  by  the  state
    authorities.  This does not seem to apply to  the  appellant's  father.
    At 2.2.3 it is stated that decision  makers  must  consider  whether  a
    person's activities and profile will have brought them to  the  adverse
    attention of the authorities.  Reference is made to political opponents
    being  perceived  by  the  government  to  be  involved  in   political
    activities which are critical of  the  government.   Counsel  submitted
    that these people may be at risk of persecution.  I do  not  find  that
    any  of  these  paragraphs  are  relevant  to  the  appellant  or   the
    appellant's father.  Counsel submitted that the government is aware  of
    the appellant's father's situation and he submitted  that  this  report
    supports the  appellant's  statement  that  the  regime  in  Gambia  is
    oppressive.   There  seems  to  be  no  information  relating  to   the
    appellant's father's asylum claim so I am unable to comment on this  or
    how it would be looked at by the government in Gambia.

14. I was then referred to the Gambia Travel Advice  dated  17  June  2016.
    This warns British citizens not to discuss  political  matters  in  the
    Gambia and he submitted that the appellant's  father  has  brought  the
    government in Gambia into disrepute and this must affect the  appellant
    on return.

15. In summary, Counsel submitted that the appellant has family life in the
    United Kingdom, he has been in the United Kingdom for  many  years,  he
    has the ability to work and he will be at risk on return to Gambia.  He
    submitted that the fact that when he arrived he was aged between 11 and
    12� means that he cannot meet the terms of  paragraph  276ADE  but  the
    spirit of the Rules should be taken into account.   He  also  submitted
    that Paragraph 276ADE(1)(v) will be satisfied within 18 months.

16. Counsel submitted that not to grant indefinite leave to remain to  this
    appellant would be a disproportionate interference  to  his  Article  8
    rights.

17. The Presenting Officer submitted that there is no material error of law
    in the First-tier Tribunal Judge's  decision.  He  submitted  that  the
    judge looked at  the  evidence  carefully  and  made  findings  on  the
    appellant's life in the United Kingdom.  He was aware of his connection
    to Fulham Football Club and his family connection.  The  judge  however
    concluded that the terms of paragraph 276ADE cannot be satisfied as the
    appellant falls between 276ADE(1)(iv) and 276ADE(1)(v).

18. With regard  to  the  Article  8  assessment,  the  Presenting  Officer
    submitted that the judge more than adequately reasoned the  appellant's
    situation in the United Kingdom under Article 8.  He submitted that  it
    is difficult to see how his father's criminal  conduct  in  the  United
    Kingdom will put the appellant at risk if he is returned to  Gambia  on
    his own.

19. I was asked to uphold the First-tier Tribunal Judge's decision.

20. Counsel submitted that  the  judge  has  not  adequately  reasoned  her
    decision.  She has made no mention of any risk factors on  return.   He
    submitted that this is a relevant factor and has not been considered at
    all.  I was asked to set aside the decision and grant indefinite  leave
    to remain to this appellant.

Decision and Reasons

21. This appellant is not a minor.  He has a  half  sister  in  the  United
    Kingdom but as stated  in  paragraph  14  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge's decision his stepmother and half sister in the  UK  live  in  a
    different town.  He has limited contact with them and he did  not  know
    at the date of the hearing what his half sister's status in the UK was.
    The appellant has always known that he would have no right to be in the
    United Kingdom once his father's leave ended.

22. The judge also found that the terms of the Immigration Rules cannot  be
    satisfied.   It  is  unfortunate  but  that  is  the  case.   Paragraph
    276ADE(1)(iv) cannot be satisfied by him and paragraph 276ADE(v) cannot
    be satisfied.  The reasons for this are that  he  came  to  the  United
    Kingdom when he was over 11 years old and under 12�  years  old.   With
    regard to risk on return I find that the documents provided by  Counsel
    do not support the appellant's claim.  The appellant's father committed
    a criminal offence in the United Kingdom.  This does not mean  that  he
    is a political opponent of the President in the Gambia.  This does  not
    mean that he has brought the government in Gambia into disrepute.   His
    father has not been shown to be involved in  any  political  activities
    which are critical of the government and the only evidence which states
    that his father's case has been in the newspapers in Gambia and perhaps
    on the television is the oral evidence of the appellant and the wording
    of his most recent statement shows that he is not sure that that is the
    case. There was no evidence before the judge about his father's  asylum
    claim in the United Kingdom and on what grounds he is claiming asylum.

23. With regard to the Gambia Travel Advice this refers to visitors to  the
    Gambia.  The appellant is not a British national or a foreign national.
     It is clear from the First-tier Tribunal  Judge's  decision  that  she
    does not believe he has no family members in the Gambia (paragraph 14).
     The appellant has lived the majority of his life in  the  Gambia.   He
    has not been in the United Kingdom for 7 years.

24. The judge accepts that the appellant has family and private life in the
    United Kingdom but he does not fall within  the  Immigration  Rules  as
    regards his family life (paragraph 15).

25. The judge refers to the said case of SS Congo and Others  at  paragraph
    15 of her decision and although Counsel submitted that there  does  not
    need to be anything compelling about a claim,  for  it  to  succeed  on
    Article 8 grounds, the judge refers to  R  v  UTIAC  [2015]  EWHC  1604
    (Admin) (Paragraph 36) which states  that  the  circumstances  must  be
    "relevant, weighty and not fully provided for  within  the  Immigration
    Rules" and she find that that is not the case here.   The  judge  finds
    that the circumstances of this appeal do not take it outside the  class
    of cases which the Immigration Rules properly  provide  for.   She  has
    explained this properly in her decision.

26. At paragraph 17 the judge refers to the appellant's private life.   She
    states that she does not find that his Article 8  claim  based  on  his
    private  life  meets  the  high   threshold   required   by   paragraph
    276ADE(1)(vi).   She gives proper reasons for this.  She finds that  he
    would not have problems reintegrating in the Gambia.




    DECISION

27. I find that there are no material  errors  of  law  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge's decision and that the decision of First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Asjad, promulgated on 8 February 2016, must stand.

28. Anonymity has not been directed.
