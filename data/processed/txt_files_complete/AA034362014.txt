      Representation:
      For the Appellant: Ms B Smith of counsel instructed by Kesar &
      Co
      For the Respondent: Mr C Avery a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer




                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is a citizen of Afghanistan who was  born  on  13  April
      1994. He has been given permission  to  appeal  the  determination  of
      First-Tier Tribunal Judge Obhi ("The FTTJ") who dismissed  his  appeal
      against the respondent's decision of 12 May 2014 to  refuse  to  grant
      him further leave to remain in the UK. His  application  was  made  on
      Refugee Convention and Article 8 human rights grounds.


   2. The appellant came to the UK on 14 November 2008 and was placed in the
      care of the local authority Children's Services. He claimed asylum but
      this was refused on 25 February 2009.  He  was  granted  discretionary
      leave to remain until he was 17 ï¿½ years old. He pursued his claim  for
      asylum but that appeal was dismissed by the Tribunal on 22  May  2009.
      He then made his  application  for  further  leave  to  remain  on  15
      September 2011 which led to the refusal now under appeal.


   3. In relation to the asylum claim the appellant claimed that his  father
      and two of his uncles and his eldest brother fought  for  the  Taliban
      against the government. His father and uncle and brother were  killed.
      His paternal uncle wanted the appellant to join the  Taliban  but  his
      mother was against this. The appellant feared  that  his  uncle  would
      make him join the Taliban and fight for them. The FTTJ found that  the
      appellant had not established that  he  had  a  well-founded  fear  of
      persecution for a Convention reason and dismissed those parts  of  his
      appeal in which he claimed asylum  and  humanitarian  protection.  The
      appellant does not seek to challenge these conclusions in his  grounds
      of appeal to the Upper Tribunal.


   4. The appellant's Article 8 human rights claim was based on the  private
      and family life he claimed to have built up in the  UK.  His  evidence
      was that he had been here for five years  and  seven  months  and  had
      established a family life with his foster carer  with  whom  he  lived
      between June 2009 and June 2010. He also had a relationship  with  his
      uncle living in the UK, his wife and five-year-old son. He  had  lived
      with  them  between  2010  and  2012  after  which  he  maintained   a
      relationship through regular  weekly  visits.  He  had  established  a
      relationship with JK and she  had  become  pregnant  with  his  child.
      However, she had had a termination because she  was  young  and  still
      studying. He said that her family approved of their relationship.  The
      appellant wishes to continue his education in  the  UK  and  had  been
      offered a place at a college in Northampton to study for a  degree  in
      engineering.  He  claimed  that   to   remove   him   would   have   a
      disproportionate impact on his family and private life.


   5. The FTTJ heard oral evidence from the appellant, JK, his foster carer,
      his uncle's wife and his support worker. The findings  of  fact  which
      relate to the human rights claim are set out in paragraphs 29 to 34 of
      the determination. The FTTJ considered  the  Article  8  human  rights
      grounds under the amended Immigration Rules contained in  Appendix  FM
      and paragraph 276ADE. In paragraph 34 she reached the conclusion  that
      the appellant had not shown that he met these requirements.  She  went
      on to say that she could only consider the Article 8  grounds  outside
      the Immigration Rules if she was satisfied that there were  compelling
      reasons to do so. She found that this test was not met and went on  to
      dismiss the appeal on human rights grounds.


   6. The appellant applied  for  and  was  granted  permission  to  appeal,
      submitting that the FTTJ erred in law by  considering  the  Article  8
      human rights grounds under the new Immigration Rules and not under the
      earlier jurisprudence where the  appropriate  tests  are  set  out  in
      Razgar, R (on the Application of) v Secretary of State for the  Home
      Department  [2004]  UKHL  27  because  the  appeal  was  against   the
      respondent's decision of 12 May 2014 pursuant to his application  made
      on 15 September 2011. The new Rules had come  into  force  on  9  July
      2013, after the date of the appellant's application.  The  authorities
      of Edgehill & Anor v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2014]
      EWCA Civ 402 (02 April 2014) and Haleemudeen v Secretary of State for
      the Home Department [2014] EWCA Civ 558 (02 May 2014) are relied  on.
      It is argued that there has been no proper consideration of the  delay
      on the part of the respondent, aspects of the appellant's private life
      and the effect of removal on people important in his life. Finally, it
      is submitted that the FTTJ erred in that the appellant did not come to
      this country to seek asylum and to obtain an education but to get away
      from his uncle who was trying to force him to fight for the Taliban.


   7. There is a Rule 24  response  from  the  respondent  in  which  it  is
      submitted that the FTTJ did not err in law, the only issue was that of
      private life and Haleemudeen should be followed rather than Edgehill.


   8. I have been provided with the judgement in Haleemudeen,  Edgehill  and
      Odelola v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2009]  UKHL  25
      (20 May 2009) and the Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules coming
      into effect on 9 July 2012.


   9. Ms Smith submitted that this was one issue appeal,  whether  the  FTTJ
      should have applied Razgar principles or the new Rules. This turned on
      the interpretations of Edgehill and Haleemudeen. The appellant  argued
      that the new Rules contained transitional provisions, at paragraph 91.
      These   only   applied   if   the   provisions   under   the   heading
      "Implementation" did not apply. She placed reliance on  paragraph  4.3
      of the Explanatory Memorandum.


  10. I was referred to paragraph 7 (background),  22  onwards  (discussion)
      and 32 (conclusion) in Edgehill. Haleemudeen made no reference to  the
      transitional provisions. She accepted that  Haleemudeen  and  Edgehill
      were at odds. In Haleemudeen the Court of Appeal looked  only  at  the
      Rules in force at the date of the decision. There was no reference  as
      to when the new Rules came into force. She submitted that this  was  a
      material error and the decision should  be  set  aside.  Not  all  the
      material evidence been taken into account and I was asked to remit the
      appeal to the First-Tier Tribunal  to  be  reheard  with  no  findings
      preserved and the oral evidence given again. There would  have  to  be
      evidence directed to addressing the provisions of the Immigration  Act
      2014. In reply to my question, Ms  Smith  confirmed  that  the  asylum
      decision was not challenged.


  11. In his submissions Mr Avery accepted  that  the  Court  of  Appeal  in
      Haleemudeen had made no  reference  to  Edgehill.  He  relied  on  the
      respondent's Rule 24 response. Edgehill was decided in the context  of
      the provisions of paragraph 276ADE. Haleemudeen addressed more general
      and wider principles. In reply to my question he  submitted  that  the
      paragraphs which assisted were 41 and 42 although  he  accepted  there
      was no direct reference to the precise provisions of the Statement  of
      Changes in Immigration Rules.


  12. The respondent's position was that no findings of  fact  made  by  the
      FTTJ had been challenged. Given these findings it was difficult to see
      how the FTTJ could have reached a different conclusion even if  Razgar
      principles had been applied. Mr Avery  submitted  that  there  was  no
      material error of law because any judge properly directing himself  or
      herself would have concluded that the appellant  failed  under  Razgar
      principles. The appellant had made false asylum claim.  He  still  had
      family in Afghanistan. There was no lacuna in  the  findings  as  they
      related to the human rights grounds.  The  FTTJ  had  dealt  with  all
      material issues. However, if I was against  him  in  relation  to  the
      error of law he submitted that the findings of fact should stand.


  13. In her reply, Ms Smith referred me to the context of Edgehill, set out
      in paragraphs 12 and 15 which showed that it  was  a  case  addressing
      Article 8 human  rights  grounds.  The  FTTJ  had  taken  an  approach
      restricted to Article 8 under the Rules.  A  properly  applied  Razgar
      approach would consider the effect of the proposed  removal  on  those
      close to him as well as the conditions he  would  face  on  return  to
      Afghanistan.


  14. I reserved my determination.


  15. I have given careful consideration to what both representatives  agree
      are the conflicting and opposite conclusions reached by the  Court  of
      Appeal in Edgehill and Haleemudeen. With great respect it seems to  me
      that there were more detailed submissions on the point  and  a  closer
      analysis in paragraphs 22 to 33 of Edgehill 33 than was  the  case  in
      Haleemudeen where the main analysis is contained in paragraphs 40  and
      41. I reject the submission that the  analysis  in  Edgehill  did  not
      cover Article 8 human rights grounds. It  is  clear  that  it  did.  I
      prefer the analysis in Edgehill and conclude that in  this  appeal  as
      the appellant made his application for further  leave  before  9  July
      2012 and the respondent had not made a decision on  it  by  that  date
      then the Article 8 grounds should have been considered  in  line  with
      what I will refer to as  the  Razgar  jurisprudence  rather  than  the
      Article 8 provisions of the Immigration Rules which came  into  effect
      on that date. I note that the  point  was  taken  by  counsel  in  her
      skeleton argument before the FTTJ.


  16. The grounds of appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal  submit  that  the  FTTJ
      failed to consider the  effect  on  the  appellant  of  delay  by  the
      respondent, made no adequate examination of  the  appellant's  private
      life and failed to consider the effect of his removal on those  people
      who were important in his life. I find  no  arguable  merit  in  these
      grounds which are in  substance  no  more  than  a  disagreement  with
      conclusions properly reached by the FTTJ on all the evidence.  In  the
      light of my conclusion as to the law to be applied any delay  did  not
      cause the Article 8 grounds to be considered  under  principles  which
      were not in effect at the date of the  application.  The  delay  meant
      that the appellant was able to build up a stronger private  life  than
      might otherwise have  been  the  case.  On  the  evidence  as  to  the
      appellant's relationship with others the FTTJ was entitled to conclude
      that he had a private life but not a family life.


  17. I find that the decision to apply the Rules which came into effect  on
      9 July 2012 was an error of law. I must  consider  whether  it  was  a
      material error or, put another way, an error which should result in my
      setting aside the decision. After determining the appeal on Article  8
      grounds under the Rules the FTTJ  went  on  to  consider  whether  she
      should consider them outside the Rules. She concluded that she  should
      not because there were no compelling reasons to do so. I  accept  that
      that  statement  did  not  indicate  that  there  had  been   a   full
      consideration under Razgar principles. However, I have considered  the
      FTTJ's findings of credibility  and  fact  in  paragraphs  28  to  34,
      separating them from her reasoning and analysis. I find that any judge
      properly directing himself or herself was bound to  have  reached  the
      conclusion that the Article 8 private life grounds turned on the  last
      test, proportionality, and the  respondent  had  established  that  it
      would be a proportionate interference with the  appellant's  right  to
      respect for his private life to remove him from the UK.


  18. The FTTJ did not make an anonymity direction. I have not been asked to
      do so and see no need for one.


  19. Whilst the determination does contain an error of law I find  that  it
      was not a material error and I uphold  the  decision  to  dismiss  the
      appellant's appeal on both asylum and human rights grounds.
