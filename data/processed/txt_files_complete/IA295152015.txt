Representation:
Appellant   Mr Harrison (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer)
Respondent  Mr Ahmed, Counsel, instructed by AGI Solicitors

                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. The respondent in these proceedings was  the  appellant  before  the
       First-tier Tribunal. From hereon I have referred to the  parties  as
       they were in the First-tier Tribunal so that for  example  reference
       to the respondent is a reference to the Secretary of State  for  the
       Home Department.

    2. I do not make an anonymity order  under  rule  14  of  the  Tribunal
       Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (SI 2008/2698 as amended).

    3. The appellant is a national of China. On July 16, 2014 the appellant
       applied for leave to remain on human rights grounds. The  respondent
       refused her application on August 20, 2015 and gave a direction  for
       her removal under the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.

    4. The appellant appealed  that  decision  on  August  27,  2015  under
       Section 82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002
       and her appeal  came  before  Designated  Judge  of  the  First-tier
       Tribunal McClure  and  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Durance
       (hereinafter referred to as "the Panel" on  April  13,  2016.  In  a
       decision promulgated on May 16, 2016  they  allowed  the  appeal  on
       human rights grounds.

    5. The respondent appealed the Panel's decision on  May  31,  2016  and
       permission to appeal was granted by Designated Judge of  the  First-
       tier Tribunal Woodcraft on September 27, 2016. He found that it  was
       arguable the Panel had erred by not applying the  Immigration  Rules
       but instead allowing the appeal under  the  principles  set  out  in
       Sanade and others (British children-Zambrano-Dereci) [2012] UKUT  48
       (IAC).

    6. The matter came before me on the above date and on that  occasion  I
       heard submissions from both representatives.

PRELIMINARY ISSUES

    7. In Sanade and others (British children - Zambrano -  Dereci)  [2012]
       UKUT 00048 (IAC) the Tribunal held that Ruiz Zambrano [2011] EUECJ C-
       34/09 "now makes it  clear  that  where  the  child  or  indeed  the
       remaining spouse is a British citizen and therefore a citizen of the
       European Union, as a matter of EU law it is not possible to  require
       the family as a unit to relocate outside of the  European  Union  or
       for the Secretary of State to submit that it would be reasonable for
       them to do so".

    8. I raised with Mr Harrison whether the  decision  of  Sanade  was  no
       longer good law because effectively that was  what  his  colleague's
       grounds of appeal raised.

    9. Mr Harrison agreed that there was nothing  in  the  changes  brought
       about by the Immigration Act 2014 that altered  the  effect  of  the
       Tribunal's decision in Sanade. That case remained good law.

   10. It therefore followed that it was open to the  Panel  to  reach  the
       conclusion  that  it  did  in  this  appeal  and  consequently,   by
       agreement, there was no error in law.

DECISION

   11. The making of the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  not
       involve the making of an error on a  point  of  law.  I  uphold  the
       decision.
