For the Respondent:    Mr S Kandola, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant, a national of Ghana, appealed to the First-tier Tribunal
    against the decision of the Secretary of State of 27th November 2017 to
    refuse his application for leave to remain in the UK on  the  basis  of
    his  private  and  family  life.   First-tier  Tribunal  Judge   Pooler
    dismissed the appeal in a decision promulgated on 8th June  2018.   The
    Appellant now appeals to this Tribunal with permission granted by First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Shimmin on 7th September 2018.

 2. The background to this appeal is that  the  Appellant  claims  to  have
    entered the UK on 11th September 2002 when he was aged 14.   He  claims
    that his father was naturalised as a British citizen and  obtained  his
    first British passport on 1st July 2003 when the Appellant was 15.  The
    Appellant claims that he understood that he  had  leave  to  remain  or
    status based on  that  of  that  of  his  father.   In  late  2006  the
    Appellant's father had a stroke which resulted  in  both  physical  and
    mental disability and he began to reside in a care home.  The Appellant
    turned 18 in February 2006 but, as  accepted  by  the  judge,  remained
    ignorant of his immigration status.  The Appellant began a relationship
    with [CK] a British national, they first met  in  September  2014.   It
    appears that the Appellant became aware of his lack  of  status  in  or
    about 2015 [38].  The Appellant's first application to the Secretary of
    State was made early in 2016.

 3. The First-tier Tribunal Judge considered the appeal  and  decided  that
    because they intend to marry the Appellant is the fianc� of Ms [K]  and
    therefore a partner within GEN.1.2 of Appendix FM.  However, the  judge
    decided that the Appellant does not meet the  eligibility  requirements
    in E-LTRP.1.12 which requires in order to be granted leave to remain as
    a fianc�(e) an applicant must have been granted entry  clearance  as  a
    fianc�(e).  The judge considered the  Appellant's  private  life  under
    paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) and found that it had not been established that
    there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles   to   the   Appellant's
    integration in Ghana.  The  judge  went  on  to  consider  whether  the
    Appellant's removal would give rise to a breach of  Article  8  through
    GEN.3.2 of Appendix FM.  The judge accepted that there was family  life
    between the Appellant and his fianc�e and that the Appellant  has  also
    established  private   life.    The   judge   went   on   to   consider
    proportionality considering the factors set out in Section 117B of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  The Judge concluded that
    it had not been established that  to  remove  the  Appellant  from  the
    United Kingdom would  have  unjustifiably  harsh  consequence  for  the
    Appellant or  his  fianc�e  and  found  that  the  public  interest  in
    maintaining immigration control outweighs all of the factors  on  which
    the Appellant relies and dismissed the appeal.

 4. There are four grounds put forward in the grounds  of  appeal.   It  is
    contended in the first ground that the judge erred in his assessment of
    whether there are  "very  significant  obstacles"  to  the  Appellant's
    integration  in  Ghana  in  accordance  with  paragraph  276ADE(1)(vi).
    Reliance is placed on the judgement of Sales LJ in Kamara v SSHD [2016]
    EWCA Civ 813 at paragraph 18:

         "It is not appropriate to treat the statutory language  as  subject
         to some gloss and it will usually be  sufficient  for  a  court  or
         Tribunal simply to direct itself in the terms that  Parliament  has
         chosen to use.   The  idea  of  'integration'  calls  for  a  broad
         evaluative judgment to be made as to whether the individual will be
         enough of an insider in terms of  understanding  how  life  in  the
         society in that country is carried on and a capacity to participate
         in it, so as to have a reasonable opportunity to be accepted there,
         to be able to operate on a day-to-day basis in that society and  to
         build up within a reasonable time a variety of human  relationships
         to give substance to the individual's private or family life.".

 5. Mr Fripp contended that the judge had failed to do this  and  that  the
    factors considered at paragraph 27 fall short of an assessment  of  the
    Appellant's ability to integrate in Ghana.  He contended that there are
    three key factors within the Appellant's case  which  demonstrate  that
    the Appellant, upon return, would not be enough of an insider in Ghana,
    these are the period of time since the  Appellant  left  Ghana,  around
    sixteen years; the  fact  that  he  was  14  when  he  left  Ghana  and
    accordingly had never lived there as an adult; and the fact that he had
    no family ties or friends in Ghana.  Mr Fripp contended that the  judge
    failed to get far enough into the question to address the issue  as  to
    whether the Appellant would be enough  of  an  insider  in  Ghana.   He
    further contended that  the  judge  added  a  gloss  to  the  statutory
    language and appeared to require exceptionality at paragraph  27  where
    he referred to there being "a relatively high threshold".  He said that
    the test is "very significant obstacles" and that the imposition of the
    phrase  relatively  high  threshold  may   suggest   that   the   judge
    misunderstood the test.  In  his  submission  the  appeal  should  have
    succeeded under 276ADE(1)(vi).

 6. Mr Kandola submitted that the judge dealt with this  issue  adequately.
    He submitted that at paragraph 24 the judge  set  out  the  submissions
    made by Mr Fripp at the hearing in the First-tier  Tribunal  and  dealt
    with the issue at paragraphs 25, 26 and 27.

 7. In my view, the judge dealt with this issue adequately.  The judge  set
    out the Respondent's position  at  paragraph  23  and  the  Appellant's
    position at paragraph 24.  At paragraph 25  the  judge  considered  the
    factors in the Appellant's  favour  taking  into  account  the  factors
    pointed out by Mr Fripp including the  fact  that  when  the  Appellant
    lived in Ghana he was a child and that he has never lived independently
    in Ghana but was dependent there upon his parents. The  judge  accepted
    that, although the Appellant will  have  retained  memories  of  Ghana,
    those will be of little or no assistance to him in establishing himself
    in Ghana because he has no  experience  of  the  workings  of  Ghanaian
    society as they apply  to  a  young  adult  who  needs  employment  and
    accommodation in order to survive.  But on the  other  hand  the  judge
    took into account factors set out in paragraphs 26 and 27 including the
    fact that the Appellant has a great deal of support  from  his  friends
    and family in the UK and that they would be able to support him when he
    returns in Ghana including introducing him to people there who might be
    able to assist him in financial terms.  This finding is  based  on  the
    evidence before the judge consistent with the  assertion  made  by  the
    Secretary of State that the Appellant has lived in a diaspora community
    from Ghana in the UK and retains cultural ties to Ghana.

 8. The judge went on at paragraph 27 to say that he did not doubt that the
    Appellant would experience difficulty if returned to Ghana but that  it
    was for the Appellant to prove not merely that the  difficulties  would
    be significant but that they would be very significant,  a  test  which
    the judge said "implies a relatively high threshold".  I do not  accept
    that the judge can be criticised for using this phrase to highlight the
    word  'very'  in  the  test  which  elevates   the   threshold   beyond
    significant.  In my view, this does not indicate that the judge applied
    the wrong test.

 9. The judge also took into account the fact that Appellant appears to  be
    relatively well-educated; that he has no health problems or  disability
    and concluded that there would not be very significant obstacles to the
    Appellant integrating in Ghana.  In my view, this conclusion  was  open
    to the judge on the basis of the evidence before him.

10. The judge went on to consider GEN.3 of Appendix FM of  the  Immigration
    Rules, which states as follows:


         GEN.3.2.(1) Subject to sub-paragraph (4), where an application  for
         entry clearance or  leave  to  enter  or  remain  made  under  this
         Appendix, or an application for leave to remain which has otherwise
         been considered under this Appendix, does not  otherwise  meet  the
         requirements of this Appendix or Part 9 of the Rules, the decision-
         maker must consider whether the circumstances in sub-paragraph  (2)
         apply.


         (2) Where sub-paragraph (1) above applies, the decision-maker  must
         consider,  on  the  basis  of  the  information  provided  by   the
         applicant, whether there are exceptional circumstances which  would
         render refusal of entry clearance, or leave to enter or  remain,  a
         breach of Article 8 of the European  Convention  on  Human  Rights,
         because  such  refusal  would   result   in   unjustifiably   harsh
         consequences for the applicant, their partner, a relevant child  or
         another family member whose Article 8 rights  it  is  evident  from
         that information would be affected by  a  decision  to  refuse  the
         application.

11. Mr Fripp contended that the  judge  erred  in  his  assessment  of  the
    Appellant's private life under Article 8  because  he  failed  to  take
    account of the Appellant's lack of knowledge of the  precarious  nature
    of his immigration status.  He highlighted that at paragraphs 10 and 11
    the judge accepted that the Appellant was unaware  of  the  immigration
    process or that he had no status in the UK when he was 15 and that  his
    father had a stroke in 2006 and that the Appellant remained ignorant of
    his immigration status when he became 18 in 2006.  The judge  found  at
    paragraph 38 that it is likely that the Appellant first became aware of
    his lack of status in about 2015.

12. Mr Fripp relied on paragraph 53 of the Supreme Court's  decision  in  R
    (Agyarko) v SSHD [2017] UKSC 11 where the  court  was  considering  the
    precarious  nature  of  immigration  status  in   the   assessment   of
    proportionality in relation to Article 8 and said:

         "Finally,  in  relation  to  this  matter,  the  reference  in  the
         instruction to "full knowledge that their stay here is unlawful  or
         precarious" is also consistent with the case law  of  the  European
         court, which refers to the persons concerned being aware  that  the
         persistence of family life in the host state  would  be  precarious
         from the outset (as in Jeunesse, para 108).  One can, for  example,
         envisage circumstances in which people might be under a  reasonable
         misapprehension as to their ability to maintain a  family  life  in
         the UK, and in which a less stringent approach might  therefore  be
         appropriate."

13. In this case the judge undertook an assessment as  to  the  Appellant's
    knowledge of his immigration status in the context of his  family  life
    and his developing relationship with Ms [K] and found at  paragraph  39
    that the relationship was still in its relatively early stages when the
    Appellant became aware of his lack of status and that he and Ms [K] did
    not become partners until  a  time  when  he  was  well  aware  of  his
    immigration status.  At paragraph 12 of the decision  the  judge  found
    that "the Appellant was somewhat vague in his statement as to his early
    adult life.  He spent time with his family (including  some  time  with
    his father) and with friends and he attended church".  This finding has
    not been challenged.  I note that paragraph 31 the judge accepted  that
    the Appellant had established private  life,  he  had  had  established
    relationships with  others  with  whom  he  has  social  relationships,
    including those in friendship groups and in the church which he attends
    and the relationships he has with adult relatives. However Mr Fripp did
    not point  to  evidence  of  any  aspect  of  private  life  which  was
    particularly weighty in the  Appellant's  favour.   There  was  nothing
    before the judge to highlight any aspect of his private life  developed
    up to 2015 to which particular weight would have been attached.  In  my
    view it is clear that the judge had in mind  the  Appellant's  lack  of
    knowledge of his immigration status up until 2015 and specifically took
    that into account at paragraph 38 of the decision.   In  my  view  this
    ground discloses no material error of law.

14. It is contended in the third ground of appeal that the judge  erred  in
    his assessment of the  Appellant's  failure  to  meet  the  Immigration
    Rules.  Reliance is placed on SSHD v SS (Congo) and Others [2015]  EWCA
    Civ 387 where Richards LJ in the Court of Appeal at 55 to 56  indicated
    that the degree of distance from the requirements  of  the  Immigration
    Rules was a relevant factor for the  purposes  of  the  proportionality
    assessment.  It is contended that it is  solely  paragraph  E-LTRP.1.12
    which prevented consideration of the Appellant's appeal under  Appendix
    FM and EX.1 in particular.  It is  contended  that  the  weight  to  be
    attached to the failure to meet paragraph E-LTRP.1.12 required  express
    consideration.  Mr  Kandola  contended  that  the  judge  undertook  an
    adequate assessment of this issue.

15. At paragraph 28 the judge highlighted the provisions of GEN.3.2 and the
    requirement  to  consider  whether  the   refusal   would   result   in
    unjustifiably harsh consequences for  the  Appellant,  his  partner  or
    other family member.  The judge went through the steps set out in  R  v
    SSHD ex parte Razgar  [2004]  UKHL  27  and  reached  conclusions  from
    paragraph 35 onwards, reaching the ultimate conclusion at paragraph  44
    that the decision to remove the Appellant would not have  unjustifiably
    harsh consequences for the Appellant or Ms [K].   In  my  view,  it  is
    clear from the assessment at paragraph 42  in  relation  to  the  entry
    clearance issue that the judge was fully aware of  the  fact  that  the
    Appellant could not meet the Rules simply on the basis of the  lack  of
    entry clearance.  This is clearly a factor which  was  in  the  judge's
    mind in the assessment of proportionality.  In my view this ground  has
    not been made out.

16. It is contended in the fourth  ground  that  the  judge  erred  in  the
    conclusions at paragraph 42 that where the judge said:

         "I raised in the hearing the possibility of the appellant returning
         to Ghana in order to apply for entry clearance.   Ms  [K]  said  in
         evidence that she was working part-time and earning around  �11,000
         to �15,000 per annum.  If she worked full-time, she said  that  she
         would earn probably �15,000 to �19,000.  She  had  been  hoping  to
         start a master's degree course in  September  2018;  she  had  been
         offered a place at university but would not be able to  pursue  the
         course if she had to work full-time."

    The judge went on at paragraph 44:

         "On her evidence, she would probably be  able  to  earn  enough  to
         sponsor an application for entry clearance and any separation would
         be for a limited period during which it would be possible for  them
         to keep in contact and to meet in the course of visits.  She  would
         have to postpone her further education; but nothing in the evidence
         suggested that such a course would be unduly harsh".

17. Mr Fripp contended that the judge's conclusion was not supported by the
    evidence.  However, there is no challenge to the recording of the  oral
    evidence at paragraph 42.  He contended that Appendix FM requires  that
    the partner has a gross annual income of at least �18,600 and that  has
    to be maintained for at least six months prior to application.   It  is
    contended that the range given in oral evidence was one which had  only
    at the very top end reached and exceeded the �18,600 required.   It  is
    contended  that  the  judge  ignored  the  effect  of  the   evidential
    requirements at Appendix FM-SE.   It  is  further  contended  that  the
    partner expressed an entirely legitimate commitment  to  her  education
    and that, in deciding that it would not be unduly harsh if she  had  to
    postpone further education, the  judge  treated  this  too  lightly  or
    provided insufficient reasons for finding that a delay  or  abandonment
    of education is not a significant matter deserving real weight  in  the
    proportionality assessment.

18. However, I find that it was open to the judge, on the basis of Ms [K]'s
    oral evidence, to find that she could earn sufficient  funds  to  bring
    her within the Entry Clearance requirements.   This  is  a  factor  the
    judge was entitled to take into  account.   I  find  that  the  judge's
    findings at paragraph 44 that it was for Ms [K] to potentially postpone
    her studies in order to work on a full-time basis was open  to  him  on
    the basis of the evidence before him.  In my view, this ground has  not
    been made out.

19. Having considered all of the grounds put forward I conclude  that  none
    of the grounds have been made out.  In the circumstances the judge made
    findings open to him based on the evidence.  There is no material error
    of law disclosed in this decision.
