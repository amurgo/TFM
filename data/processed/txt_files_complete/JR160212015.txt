    JUDGE Rintoul:


 1. The applicant challenges the respondent's decision made  on  1 October
    2015 to refuse his application for indefinite leave to  remain  on  the
    basis of long residence.


 2. The applicant's case is that he entered the United Kingdom illegally on
    11 October 2000  and  claimed  asylum  on  13  October  2000.   He  was
    interviewed in connection with that application and on 23 November 2000
    was served with forms IS151A and IS96 requiring him  to  report  on  28
    December 2000 and thereafter on a monthly basis.


 3. The applicant was interviewed in connection with his asylum claim on 11
    November 2003.  That application was, on the Secretary of State's case,
    refused by a letter  dated  25 November  2003  and  sent  by  recorded
    delivery on 12 December 2003 to the applicant's  then  representatives,
    Noble Jones.  It is also stated in the letter of 1 October 2015 that he
    was at the same time  served  with  a  form  IS96  authorising  further
    temporary admission, subject to restrictions.


 4. The  applicant  later  changed  representatives  more  than  once.  The
    applicant's current representatives wrote to the  respondent  in  2010,
    requesting that his case be considered under the legacy scheme.  He was
    then interviewed and made further representations.  The  appellant  was
    then also put on reporting restrictions (temporary admission).


 5. On 6 September 2011 the applicant was granted discretionary  leave  for
    three years pursuant valid until 6 September 2014.


 6. On 19 August 2014 the applicant  made  an  application  for  indefinite
    leave to remain on the basis that he had been lawfully resident for ten
    years, taking into  account  the  period  he  had  spent  on  temporary
    admission prior to the grant of leave.  That  application  was  refused
    but he was granted a further period of  discretionary  leave  until  26
    November 2017.


 7. The applicant then sought to challenge the decision of 26 November 2014
    by way of judicial review.  That application  was  later  withdrawn  by
    consent.  The respondent reconsidered the application  and  decided  to
    maintain the refusal on 1 October 2015, stating that he had, prior  to
    the grant on 5 September 2011, failed to comply with the conditions  of
    temporary admission as he had failed to report, a form being issued  to
    that effect.


 8. The applicant's case is that the decision of 25 November 2003 was not a
    valid decision under the Immigration Rules as it was  not  communicated
    to the applicant and that consequently he did not stop accruing further
    time towards long residence and satisfied the requirements of paragraph
    276B of the Immigration Rules as then in place.


 9. The respondent's case is as set out in the letter  of  1  October  2015
    that the applicant had not maintained a continuous lawful residence  in
    the United Kingdom for two reasons:-


      1) because he had been properly served with a refusal notice in  2003;
         and/or


      2) he had absconded from temporary admission in 2011 and that  he  had
         failed to report and had been treated as an absconder.


10. In the detailed grounds of  defence,  the  respondent  also  sought  to
    resist the applicant's case on the basis that in any event he could not
    have obtained indefinite leave to remain as he  had  failed  to  comply
    with the requirements of  Appendix  KoLL  as  he  had  not  provided  a
    certificate of his competence in English.


11.  The  respondent  does,  however,  now  accept  that  at  the  time  of
    application he did comply with the requirements of Appendix KoLL as  at
    that time all it required was the production of a certificate that  the
    applicant had passed the knowledge of life in the UK test.  That ground
    is no longer pursued.  It did, however, require the applicant  and  his
    representatives to undertake a significant amount of unnecessary  work.




The Law


12. At the relevant time paragraph 276B of the Immigration  Rules  provided
    as follows:-

       276B. The requirements to be met by an applicant for indefinite leave
       to remain on the ground of long residence in the United  Kingdom  are
       that:


       (i)(a) he has had at least 10 years continuous  lawful  residence  in
       the United Kingdom; or
        (b) he has had at least 14 years continuous residence in the  United
       Kingdom excluding any period spent in the  United  Kingdom  following
       service of liability to removal or notice of a decision to remove  by
       way of directions under paragraphs  87  to  10A   or  12  to  14,  of
       Schedule 2  in  the  Immigration  Act  1971  or  section  10  of  the
       Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 or of a notice of intention to deport
       him from the United Kingdom; and

13. "Continuous lawful residence was, at  the  relevant  time,  defined  in
    paragraph 276A

       276A. For the purposes of paragraphs 276B to 276E:
       ... (b)  "Lawful  residence"  means  residence  which  is  continuous
       residence pursuant to:
       (i) Existing leave to enter or remain; or
       (ii) Temporary admission within section 11  of  the  1971  Act  where
       leave to enter or remain is subsequently granted; or
       (iii) An exemption  from  immigration  control,  including  where  an
       exemption ceases to apply if it is immediately followed by a grant of
       leave to enter or remain



14. Temporary admission is a  term  of  art,  albeit  not  defined  in  the
    Immigration  Rules,  or  expressly  in  the  Immigration  Acts;  it  is
    explained in R (MS, AR & FW) v SSHD [2009] EWCA Civ  1310  at  [3]  per
    Sedley LJ: -

       3.  Temporary admission is a term of statutory  art  created  by  the
       combined effect of paragraphs 16 and 21 of Sch 2 to  the  Immigration
       Act 1971:
       16 (1) A person who may be required to submit  to  examination  under
       paragraph  2  above  may  be  detained  under  the  authority  of  an
       immigration officer pending his examination and pending a decision to
       give or refuse him leave to enter.
       (2) If there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that a  person  is
       someone in respect of whom directions  may  be  given  under  any  of
       paragraphs 8 to 10A or 12 to 14, that person may  be  detained  under
       the authority of an immigration officer pending-
       (a) a decision whether or not to give such directions;
       (b) his removal in pursuance of such directions.
       21(1) A person liable to detention or  detained  under  paragraph  16
       above may, under the written authority of an immigration officer,  be
       temporarily admitted to the United Kingdom without being detained  or
       released from  detention;  but  this  shall  not  prejudice  a  later
       exercise of the power to detain him.
       (2) So long as a person is at large in the United Kingdom  by  virtue
       of this paragraph, he shall be subject to  such  restrictions  as  to
       residence, as to his employment or occupation and as to reporting  to
       the police or an immigration officer as may  from  time  to  time  be
       notified to him in writing by an immigration officer.

15. The applicant's case is that he was on temporary admission continuously
    prior to the grant to him of leave to remain and that, accordingly,  he
    met the requirements of paragraph 276B of the Immigration Act. He avers
    that he was never served with the refusal letter of 25 November 2003.


16. The respondent's case as set out in the summary grounds of  defence  at
    [7] to [8] is that the applicant had not had continuous lawful presence
    as he had in the past failed to comply with reporting restrictions, and
    that his absconding applied as a break in a period of lawful residence.
      While it is averred [6] that the refusal  letter  had  been  properly
    served, that is in the context of a submission that the applicant could
    not have accrued leave to remain.


17. In the detailed grounds, it is averred  [15]  that  the  applicant  had
    failed  to  comply  with  the  conditions   of   temporary   admission,
    specifically that on 17 May 2011 he had been issued with a Notice to an
    offender who has failed to report, having failed to report on  4  April
    2011, and thus his right to remain on temporary admission ceased. It is
    also averred that the respondent had nonetheless considered  exercising
    her discretion to overlook the gap, but had concluded that it  was  not
    appropriate to exercise discretion in the applicant's favour.


18. While much of the evidence adduced, and the submissions made, concerned
    whether the refusal notices  were  properly  served  in  2003,  as  the
    respondent contends, this is, on  reflection,  not  the  most  relevant
    issue.


19. There is no basis on which either refusal of asylum or the  service  of
    the notices identified in Mr Williams statement, could affect temporary
    admission which  That continues irrespective of whether an asylum claim
    is refused; it is based on the powers to detain set out in the 1971 Act
    which are unaffected by such decisions.


20. In  the  circumstances,  as  this  issue  had  not  been  addressed  in
    submissions, I gave further directions to the parties as follows: -

        1. Following the hearing on 31 May 2017, it appears  on  reflection
           that it is unclear why it is said that service  of  the  refusal
           letter (and/or accompanying  notices)  had  any  impact  on  the
           applicant's  temporary  admission,  either  terminating  it,  or
           causing him to be treated as an absconder.


        2. It also appears  from  the  CID  Calendar  of  Events  that  the
           applicant was treated as an absconder,  but  the  note  to  that
           effect was made in February 2012, after the applicant  had  been
           granted leave to remain, and  there  appears  to  have  been  no
           decision to treat him as an absconder prior to that date.


        3. It is my view that the parties should be given an opportunity to
           make submissions on the above matters, if so advised,  within  7
           days of the issue of these directions.

21. In  her  further  submissions,  subsequent  to  these  directions,  the
    respondent states that [2] neither the service of the refusal letter or
    the applicant's failure to comply with the conditions of his  temporary
    admission had any impact on his temporary admission which  only  ceased
    on 6 September 2011.  It is also accepted [3] - [5], contrary  to  what
    had previously been pleaded, that no absconder action was taken against
    the applicant.


22. The respondent does, however, contend that service  of  an  enforcement
    notices "stops the clock" in terms of a person  being  able  to  accrue
    time towards lawful residence, but does not explain why that is  so  by
    reference to the Immigration Rules.  It is of note that the  respondent
    has accepted that temporary admission continued after the service of an
    enforcement notice; it is not submitted that service of such  a  notice
    caused temporary admission to end, rather that  its  continued  accrual
    cannot count towards lawful residence. That is in itself  an  admission
    that the continuity of temporary admission was not affected.


23. The definitions of "continuous residence"  and  "lawful  residence"  in
    paragraph 276A operate in such a  way  that  "lawful  residence"  is  a
    qualified form of continuous residence. For residence to be lawful,  it
    must be continuous, as defined, and additional requirements set out  in
    276B (b) at (i)- (iii) must  be  met.  While  continuous  residence  as
    defined is broken by removal or departure from the United  Kingdom,  it
    is only imposition of a period of imprisonment  that  otherwise  breaks
    continuity (276B (a) (iv)).  It is only in paragraph 276B (i)(b) that a
    qualification to continuity of residence by reference to the service of
    a notice is introduced, but that  qualification  applies  only  to  the
    accrual of continuous residence for the purposes of that sub-paragraph;
    it does not alter the definition of continuous residence.


24. I accept service of a notice of the class referred to in paragraph 276B
    (i) (b) would prevent accrual of continuous residence for the  purposes
    of 276B (i)(b) as that is expressly stated. There is no such proviso in
    paragraph 276B (i)(a), and there is no basis on which the "stopping the
    clock" proviso could be read into that provision.  The use of  "or"  at
    the end  of  paragraph  276B  (i)(a)  demonstrates  that  the  separate
    provisions relating to "lawful residence"  and  "continuous  residence"
    which includes unlawful residence, were meant to be read disjunctively.
    Further, the scheme of the rules is such that continuous  residence  as
    defined in 276A is not  interrupted  by  the  service  of  the  notices
    referred to in 276B (i)(b)


25. Further support for differential treatment  of  lawful  and  continuous
    residence can be drawn from the manner in  which  they  are  separately
    defined in paragraphs 276A.


26. In the circumstances, and given the concessions made by the  respondent
    in her further submissions, it is unnecessary to reach any  conclusions
    on whether or not the refusal letter of December  2003  and  the  other
    documents said to have accompanied  it  were  in  fact  served  on  the
    applicant.


27. Accordingly, for these reasons, the  respondent  could  not  rationally
    have concluded that the  applicant  had  not  had  temporary  admission
    and/or leave to remain for a period of at least 10 years prior  to  his
    application for Indefinite Leave to Remain. Indeed, it appears that  he
    did and I make a declaration to that effect


28. I therefore quash the decision of 1 October 2015.


29. I would expect that, in the light of this, and  in  the  light  of  the
    findings above, that the applicant  would  now  be  granted  Indefinite
    Leave to Remain in the light of my declaration. It is not anywhere  now
    submitted that there was any basis on which the application fell to  be
    dismissed on public interests grounds (paragraph  276B  (ii)).  It  has
    been conceded that the requirement to have  demonstrated  knowledge  of
    the English language and sufficient knowledge of  life  in  the  United
    Kingdom which was in place at the relevant time was met.


    Costs


30. The respondent has not attended to make  submissions  on  costs.  I  am
    satisfied that the applicant is entitled to recover his costs.  I  note
    also that the respondent's case has changed  significantly  during  the
    proceedings, and has now accepted that the applicant had not absconded.
    Further, the respondent raised an incorrect ground of defence which she
    later accepted was incorrect, owing, it appears to the wrong version of
    the Immigration Rules  being  considered.   Taking  all  of  that  into
    account, and the protracted nature of the proceedings, I  am  satisfied
    that the work conducted by the applicant's solicitors and  counsel  was
    proportionate and reasonable both as to the time spent and  as  to  the
    rate charged. Accordingly, I am satisfied that the sums claimed in  the
    schedules are justified in their entirety, and I therefore  assess  the
    costs at �14,070 in respect of  the  costs  up  to  and  including  the
    hearing, and a further �1470  in  respect  of  work  done  since  then,
    including today's hearing, the respondent having failed to attend.


31. Permission to appeal


32. I am not satisfied that my decision involved the making of an error  of
    law, or that there is any good reason to grant permission to appeal.  I
    therefore refuse permission.

Notification of appeal rights

A refusal by the Upper Tribunal  of  permission  to  bring  judicial  review
proceedings,  following  a  hearing  is  a   decision   that   disposes   of
proceedings.

A party may appeal against such a decision to  the  Court  of  Appeal  on  a
question of law only. Any party who wishes to appeal  should  apply  to  the
Upper Tribunal for permission, at the  hearing  at  which  the  decision  is
given. If no application is made, the Tribunal must nonetheless consider  at
the hearing whether to give or refuse permission to appeal (rule  44(4B)  of
the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).

If the Tribunal refuses permission, either in response to an application  or
by virtue of rule 44(4B), then the party wishing to  appeal  can  apply  for
permission from the Court of Appeal itself. This must be done by  filing  an
appellant's notice with the Civil Appeals Office  of  the  Court  of  Appeal
within 28 days of the date the Tribunal's decision on permission  to  appeal
was given (Civil Procedure Rules Practice Direction 52D 3.3(2)).
