Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr R. Rai, Counsel, instructed by Robinson Ravani &
                    Co. Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr E. Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DECISION AND REASONS (V)

This has been a remote hearing which has been consented to  /  not  objected
to by the parties.  The form of remote hearing was  V  (video).  A  face  to
face hearing was not held because it was  not  practicable  and  all  issues
could be determined in a remote hearing.

The documents that I was referred to were the original bundles prepared  for
the hearing before the  First-tier  Tribunal,  a  supplementary  authorities
bundle submitted by Mr Rai on the day of the hearing, and the Report of  the
[All Party Parliamentary Group] on TOEIC dated 18 July  2019,  the  contents
of which I have recorded.

The order made is described at the end of these reasons.

The parties said  this  about  the  process:  they  were  content  that  the
proceedings had been conducted fairly in remote form.

 1. This is an appeal against a decision of the Secretary of State dated 12
    June 2019 to refuse a human rights  claim  made  by  the  appellant,  a
    citizen of India born in 1989.

 2. The appeal was originally heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Page  who,
    in a decision promulgated on 9 December 2019, dismissed the appeal.  On
    9 October 2020, I found that the decision of Judge  Page  involved  the
    making of an error of law, and set it aside, with certain  findings  of
    fact preserved.  I set aside the judge's decision to the extent that it
    concerned findings that the appellant had relied on a proxy test  taker
    in an English language test.  The judge found that  the  appellant  did
    not meet the  requirements  of  the  private  life  provisions  in  the
    Immigration Rules and that there were no reasons outside the rules  for
    the appeal to be allowed, as matters stood at the time of  the  hearing
    before the First-tier Tribunal on 19 November 2019. I  preserved  those
    findings, observing at [15]  that  a  contemporary  assessment  of  the
    Article 8 rights would be required.

 3. As I directed at [14] of my earlier decision, the primary focus of  the
    resumed hearing was to determine whether the appellant engaged  in  the
    alleged use of a proxy test taker at her English speaking  and  writing
    tests on 1 May 2013.

 4. The respondent's case is based  upon  the  generic  evidence  regularly
    relied upon by  the  Secretary  of  State  when  seeking  to  establish
    allegations of deception in the context of English language tests,  and
    evidence specific to  this  appellant  said  to  demonstrate  that  she
    engaged in the alleged deception.  The specific evidence is in the form
    of what is often termed the "ETS lookup tool".  ETS is the acronym  for
    Educational  Testing  Services,  an  organisation  contracted  by   the
    respondent to provide secure  English  language  testing  services  for
    immigration purposes.

 5. The appellant's case is that she attended the tests and did not  use  a
    proxy test taker.  Mr Rai submits that if I find the  appellant  to  be
    innocent of the allegations, she should be returned to the position she
    would have been in had the allegations not been made.   Although  Judge
    Page's findings that there were no  Article  8-based  reasons  for  the
    appellant to succeed were preserved, Mr Rai submits that those findings
    were reached against the backdrop of the judge being satisfied that the
    appellant engaged in the  alleged  deception,  and  would  need  to  be
    revisited in the event that I accept the appellant's account.   Mr  Rai
    accepts that the tribunal  no  longer  has  the  power  to  direct  the
    Secretary of State to take particular steps consequential to an allowed
    appeal, but nevertheless submits that the appeal should be  allowed  on
    human rights grounds.

Documentary evidence

 6. The appellant relied on the bundle prepared for the proceedings  before
    the First-tier Tribunal, and the report of the All Party  Parliamentary
    Group on TOEIC [Test of English for International Communication]  dated
    18 July 2019 ("the APPG Report").  Although Mr  Rai  had  not  complied
    with the direction at [19] of my error  of  law  decision  to  make  an
    application  under  rule  15(2A)  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure   (Upper
    Tribunal) Rules 2008 within 14 days of being  sent  that  decision,  Mr
    Tufan did not object to the  admission  of  that  document.   Mr  Tufan
    observed that he was familiar with the APPG Report, and would  be  able
    to respond to any submissions advanced in relation to it.

Legal framework

 7. This appeal is brought under Article 8 of the  European  Convention  on
    Human Rights.  The essential issue for my consideration is  whether  it
    would  be  proportionate  under  the  terms  of  Article  8(2)  of  the
    Convention for the appellant to be removed, in the light of the  family
    and private life she claims to have established here.  This issue is to
    be addressed primarily through the lens of the respondent's Immigration
    Rules and by reference to the requirements of Article 8  directly,  see
    Razgar [2004] UKHL 27 at [17].  The relevant  rules  are  contained  in
    paragraph 276ADE.

Burden and standard of proof

 8. The burden of proof is on the appellant to establish that, at the  date
    of the hearing, she has established  private  or  family  life  in  the
    United Kingdom.  The appellant would then have to demonstrate that  her
    removal from the United Kingdom would interfere with her  rights  under
    Article 8 of the ECHR.  The appellant would  have  to  establish  these
    matters to the balance of probabilities standard.  It is then  for  the
    respondent to justify any interference to those rights within the terms
    of Article 8(2) of the ECHR.

 9. In the present matter, the respondent alleges deception.  The burden is
    on  the  respondent  to  establish  deception,  to   the   balance   of
    probabilities standard There is an evidential burden on the  respondent
    in the first instance; if he provides evidence demonstrating there  are
    reasonable grounds to conclude that the appellant used  deception,  the
    burden shifts onto  the  appellant  to  provide  a  plausible  innocent
    explanation.  If the appellant does so, the burden "shifts back" to the
    respondent to demonstrate  how,  in  light  of  that  explanation,  the
    allegation of deception is made out, to the  balance  of  probabilities
    standard.  See Secretary of State for the Home Department v Shehzad and
    Chowdury [2016] EWCA Civ 615 at [3].

10. The Secretary of State's decision quotes the summary of  this  position
    given by William Davis J in Abbas v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2017] EWHC 78 (Admin) at [7]: it does not differ  from  the
    Shehzad and Chowdury approach in any material respect.  It is merely  a
    case-specific example of the Court of Appeal's approach in action.

11. In view of the gravity and consequences of an allegation of  deception,
    stronger evidence is likely to be  required  to  meet  the  balance  of
    probabilities standard that the allegation is made out.  But  there  is
    only  one  standard  of  proof,  and  that  is  to   the   balance   of
    probabilities.

The hearing

12. The appellant gave evidence in English and adopted her statements dated
    18 August 2018 and 2 October 2019.  She  was  cross-examined.   I  will
    outline the salient aspects of her evidence to the extent necessary  to
    give reasons for my findings.

Findings

13. I reached the following findings having considered the entirety of  the
    evidence, in the round, and the submissions made by each applicant.

ETS allegations

14. First, I will address the respondent's allegations that  the  appellant
    engaged in deception at her speaking and writing tests on 1 May 2013.

15. I find that the generic evidence, when taken with the "ETS Lookup Tool"
    which  records  the  appellant's  ETS  certificate  as  "invalid",   is
    sufficient for the  respondent  to  discharge  the  initial  evidential
    burden necessary when seeking to establish a charge of deception.   The
    respondent relies on a December 2016 internal report  into  New  London
    College, which records at [4] that voice  analysis  of  speaking  tests
    suggest that 74% of such test results were obtained by  the  use  of  a
    proxy test-taker.  Candidates at the New  London  College,  opines  the
    report, demonstrated English language abilities that were significantly
    greater than candidates assessed under secure conditions.  On  the  day
    the appellant took her  test,  93%  of  the  results  were  classed  as
    invalid.

16. In Majumder and Qadir v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home  Department
    [2016] EWCA Civ 1167 Beatson LJ considered  whether  the  Secretary  of
    State's evidence adduced  in  cases  of  this  nature  was  capable  of
    discharging the legal burden  for  deception.   At  [27]  His  Lordship
    endorsed the decision of this Tribunal in the same case at  [102]  that
    each case will be fact-sensitive, with the outcome  determined  on  the
    basis of the evidence adduced by the parties.  In  practical  terms,  I
    find that  that  means  the  Secretary  of  State's  generic  evidence,
    combined with the specific material said to link that generic  evidence
    to the conduct of an appellant, will rarely, if ever, automatically  be
    able to lead to a finding  of  deception  regardless  of  the  innocent
    explanation proffered by the appellant.  In human rights cases a  case-
    specific assessment will always be required.

17. I approach the reported high incidence of "invalid" test results on the
    1 May 2013 with a degree of caution.  According to the respondent,  93%
    of tests were invalid, namely 52 out of 56.  None was valid.  I  recall
    that the allegations against  ETS  have  demonstrated  that  many  test
    centres' operations were corrupt to the core.  Many staff were  clearly
    complicit.  On conventional credibility grounds,  it  is  difficult  to
    have any degree of confidence that corrupt staff facilitating  the  use
    of proxy test takers may be trusted to perform the remainder  of  their
    functions well, such that the 93% figure is accurate,  especially  when
    one bears in mind the extensive criticisms  in,  for  example,  SM  and
    Qadir (ETS - Evidence - Burden of Proof) [2016] UKUT 229.   There,  the
    Upper Tribunal considered a report from a Dr Harrison  which  concluded
    that the generic evidence relied upon by the  Secretary  of  State  was
    flawed in a number of material respects.  The Upper Tribunal summarised
    its concerns  at  [63]:  neither  of  her  witnesses  had  any  special
    qualifications or expertise in  the  matters  they  purported  to  give
    evidence about; the Respondent was entirely  dependent  on  information
    provided by ETS; the Respondent had accepted everything reported by ETS
    "uncritically"; The decision featured a number of other  criticisms  of
    the Secretary of State's evidence.  The Upper Tribunal  held  at  [102]
    that every ETS case will invariably be  fact  sensitive;  every  appeal
    falls to be determined on the basis of  the  evidence  adduced  by  the
    parties.

18. In this respect, nothing turns on the APPG report; my task is to assess
    the credibility of the appellant's account on the evidence before me.

19. By way of a preliminary observation, I note that the  test  took  place
    almost eight years ago.  The appellant is being asked to recall  events
    which, at the time, she would have had no reason to suspect  she  would
    be challenged about in 2021.

20. In response to the respondent's allegations, the  appellant's  evidence
    is simply that she attended the test, took it herself without  the  use
    of a proxy test-taker, and that she did  not  notice  any  unlawful  or
    otherwise irregular activity at the test centre.  In  her  written  and
    oral evidence she provided an account of paying for the test  in  cash,
    paying approximately �120-�150, and the process she was  taken  through
    on the day itself in order to sit the tests. She describes how  her  ID
    documents were checked at different  points  on  the  day  itself.  The
    accounts she provided in her written statements  were  consistent  with
    the account she provided in her evidence before me.

21. The appellant also relies on her general  proficiency  in  the  English
    language. She gave evidence in fluent English before me.  The  evidence
    suggests that she has been competent in the language for some time.  In
    May 2009, she obtained an International English Language Testing System
    (IELTS") certificate.  IELTS  tests  have  not  been  impugned  by  the
    respondent.  The certificate records the appellant as having scored 5.0
    overall.  In August 2014, the appellant scored 6.0 on a  further  IELTS
    test.  I know from my special expertise in  this  tribunal  that  IELTS
    tests are usually scored out of 9.  A score  of  6  usually  denotes  a
    competent grasp of English; by August 2014, the appellant was  assessed
    by IELTS as having a competent grasp of English.  That was  a  marginal
    improvement from her score some of 5  some  five  years  earlier.   The
    higher score is broadly commensurate with a high scoring level B2 under
    the Common European Framework of Reference  for  Languages;  the  lower
    score, in 2009, is on  the  cusp  between  B1  and  B2.   Although  the
    appellant's claimed ETS scores are high, they are consistent  with  her
    IELTS-assessed proficiency the next year.  While it could be said  that
    the appellant had enjoyed, by August 2014, some 15 months in  which  to
    improve her linguistic skills, the 2009 test demonstrates that she  was
    proficient, albeit to a slightly lower level, five years earlier.  This
    is not a case of a marked increase in  competence  in  the  years  that
    followed the exam.

22. In addition, in 2016 the appellant obtained an MBA from  Angela  Ruskin
    University.  The course was taught in English.

23. That the appellant spoke good English at the time is a  factor  in  her
    favour.   Mr Tufan submits that people cheat for a variety of  reasons,
    as noted by this tribunal in MA (ETS - TOEIC testing) [2016]  UKUT  450
    (IAC).  That is,  of  course,  correct.   However,  in  MA,  the  Upper
    Tribunal set out many paragraphs of detailed  credibility  concerns  in
    relation to the appellant in those proceedings  before  dismissing  the
    possibility that the credibility concerns that  had  been  outlined  in
    extensive depth could be undermined by virtue of the simple  fact  that
    the appellant would be able to speak  English,  and  therefore  had  no
    basis to cheat.  It does not necessarily follow that competence in  the
    English language is an irrelevant factor.  In contrast to the  tribunal
    in MA, I have no separate credibility concerns about the appellant  and
    found her to be a credible and honest witness.

24. Under cross-examination, Mr Tufan asked the  appellant  about  how  she
    booked and paid for the test. She said she had been informed by friends
    that there were vacant slots at the test centre, and was able to  check
    online. She did not need to book  the  test  online,  nor  pay  for  it
    electronically, she said, as she was aware that payment could  be  made
    on the day if there were vacant slots,  and  she  was  able  simply  to
    arrive at 8 AM. Mr Tufan put  it  to  the  appellant,  and  highlighted
    during submissions, that it was not  plausible  or  realistic  for  the
    appellant simply to have turned up at the  test  centre  in  that  way,
    rather than having booked in advance. Further, he contends,  paying  in
    cash as described by the appellant is at odds with how one would expect
    an important test to be booked and arranged.

25. Mr Tufan also highlights the fact that the appellant has  not  provided
    the voice recordings  of  the  speaking  test  to  the  tribunal.   The
    appellant writes in her second statement at [12] that she had  obtained
    the recordings, but that they had not been analysed by a  professional.
    Under cross examination, she explained that she received a  quote  from
    Professor French, the expert engaged by the respondent, for over �3,000
    and she was unable to afford the fees.

26. Drawing the above factors together,  I  find  that  the  appellant  has
    provided an "innocent explanation" which satisfies the  "minimum  level
    of plausibility" (see, for example,  Muhandiramge  (section  S-LTR.1.7)
    [2015] UKUT 675 (IAC) at [10.b]).  While  the  appellant's  payment  in
    cash and arrival at the test centre without a pre-booked slot may raise
    some eyebrows in 2021, I recall that systems in place in 2013 were  not
    necessarily as advanced as they are today.  There is no  evidence  from
    the Secretary of State that the  New  London  College  did  not  accept
    bookings on the day in cash.

27. Thus the evidential pendulum swings back to the Secretary of  State  to
    refute the "innocent explanation".  The strongest point Mr Tufan has in
    response is that the  appellant  has  not  made  the  voice  recordings
    available to the tribunal.  He described the omission as  "curious"  in
    submissions, although  he  did  not  directly  put  to  her  in  cross-
    examination the allegation that she had  not  produced  the  recordings
    because they would reveal that she did  not  take  the  tests  herself,
    which was the implication of his submission.  He left unchallenged  the
    appellant's response that she could  not  commission  Professor  French
    because he was too costly, at around �3,200.  That figure accords  with
    a written estimate from French and Associates dated 18 November 2019.

28. Correctly understood, Mr Tufan's submission concerning the  absence  of
    the voice recordings fails to engage with the fact the burden  lies  on
    the Secretary of State to prove deception,  not  on  the  appellant  to
    disprove deception.  The absence of evidence on  this  point  from  the
    appellant does not amount  to  positive  proof  in  the  hands  of  the
    Secretary of State, especially considering the fact that Mr  Tufan  did
    not put to the appellant the allegation that the  reason  she  had  not
    brought the recordings was because they would reveal that she  had  not
    taken the test herself.   Inferences arising from unchallenged evidence
    are not a basis for concluding the appellant has engaged in deception.

29. Considering the allegations in the round, I find that the Secretary  of
    State has not established deception to  the  balance  of  probabilities
    standard.  I find the appellant did not use a proxy test-taker  in  the
    speaking and writing test she took on 1 May 2013.

30. The appellant therefore presents no suitability-based concerns.

Private life

31. In my error of law decision, I preserved Judge Page's findings relating
    to the appellant's Article 8 private life rights, in  so  far  as  they
    represented the position at the date of  the  hearing  on  25  November
    2019.  They were brief, but there was no reason to interfere with  them
    at that stage.  The relevant findings were at [25]:

         "[The presenting officer] was correct to say that regardless of the
         refusal made on suitability grounds the appellant has been  in  the
         UK without leave to remain since 2014 and has no  basis  to  remain
         and that there are no exceptional circumstances to consider outside
         the rules."

32. Judge Page's summary finding  that  the  appellant  "has  no  basis  to
    remain" was shorthand for his findings that there was  no  basis  under
    the Immigration Rules' private life provisions  for  the  appellant  to
    remain here.  The appellant did not challenge  those  findings  in  her
    original appeal against the First-tier  Tribunal's  decision.   As  the
    appellant confirmed under cross-examination, there has been  no  change
    to her circumstances since that decision.  She writes in her  statement
    of the tragic loss of an unborn child, but that is a matter  pre-dating
    the judge's findings.  The  appellant  is  married  to  another  Indian
    national, whose leave is dependent upon hers, and they would be able to
    return to India together.   Mr Rai did not submit  that  the  appellant
    should now be viewed  as  facing  very  significant  obstacles  to  her
    integration in India, or that there would insurmountable  obstacles  to
    the marital relationship continuing in India.

33. Mr Rai's focus was on the impact  of  the  Secretary  of  State  having
    incorrectly accused the appellant of relying on  a  proxy  test  taker.
    His submission in this respect was twofold.

34. First, he submitted that Judge  Page's  findings  that  there  were  no
    exceptional circumstances in the appellant's private life were  reached
    in the context of his findings that the appellant  had  relied  upon  a
    proxy test taker.   If I accepted the  appellant's  evidence  that  she
    took the test herself, he submitted, a different  approach  was  called
    for.  What may not necessarily be exceptional in the case of a  migrant
    who relied on deception should be revisited in the event the allegation
    of deception was  wrongly  made.  In  addition,  submits  Mr  Rai,  the
    appellant's  immigration  trajectory  was  wrongly  forced   onto   the
    incorrect course  as  a  result  of  the  unsubstantiated  allegations.
    Although he did not use the term, I understand Mr Rai to refer to  what
    was termed "historical injustice" in Patel  (historic  injustice;  NIAA
    Part 5A) [2020] UKUT 00351 (IAC).

35. There is some force to this limb of Mr Rai's  submission,  and  I  will
    return to it when conducting my overall proportionality assessment.

36. Secondly, Mr Rai relied on the approach of the Secretary  of  State  to
    implementing appeals where, as here, an appellant has been found not to
    have cheated in an English language test, having refuted allegations to
    the contrary.  He relied upon Khan & Others v Secretary  of  State  for
    the Home Department [2018] EWCA Civ 1684 at [37], where  the  Secretary
    of State's undertaking to the  Court  of  Appeal  in  relation  to  ETS
    matters was set out.  The judgment outlines part of a note to the court
    provided by the Secretary of State, which provided, where relevant:

             "(ii) For those whose leave has been curtailed, and where  the
             leave would in any event  have  expired  without  any  further
             application being made, the Respondent will provide a  further
             opportunity for the  individuals  to  obtain  leave  with  the
             safeguards in paragraph (iii) below.

         For those whose leave had expired, and who  had  made  an  in  time
         application for further leave to remain which was  refused  on  ETS
         grounds, the effect of an  FTT  determination  that  there  was  no
         deception would  be  that  the  refusal  would  be  withdrawn.  The
         applicant in question would still have an  outstanding  application
         for leave to remain and the Respondent will  provide  them  with  a
         reasonable  opportunity  to  make  any  further  changes  to  their
         application which would be considered on  the  basis  of  them  not
         having employed any deception  in  the  obtaining  of  their  TOEIC
         certificate, and they would in  no  way  be  disadvantaged  in  any
         future application they chose to make.

             (iii) In all cases, the Respondent confirms that in making any
             future decision he will not hold any  previous  gap  in  leave
             caused by any erroneous decision in relation  to  ETS  against
             the relevant applicant, and will have to take into account all
             the circumstances of each case."

37. The difficulty with Mr Rai's reliance on [37] of Khan arises  from  the
    fact that this tribunal has no power to direct the Secretary  of  State
    to adopt a particular course of action.  It is  for  the  Secretary  of
    State to implement appeals from this  tribunal,  which  may  either  be
    allowed or dismissed.  The passages in  Khan  relied  upon  by  Mr  Rai
    concern the way the Secretary of State undertook to the Court of Appeal
    to resolve cases, and does  not  directly  affect  the  proportionality
    assessment conducted by this Tribunal.  However, that the Secretary  of
    State seeks to return  those  wrongly  accused  of  ETS  fraud  to  the
    position they would have been in, had the allegations not been  raised,
    is a factor which attracts weight.

38. Factors in favour of the removal of the appellant include:

        a. The public interest in the maintenance of effective  immigration
           controls.

        b. The appellant does not meet  any  of  the  requirements  of  the
           Immigration Rules.

        c. The appellant last held leave to remain over five years ago.

39. Factors militating in favour of the appellant not being removed are  as
    follows:

        a. She was wrongly accused of using a proxy  test  taker,  and  has
           been unable to regularise her position since.

        b.  The  ETS  allegations  resulted  in  an  effective   in-country
           prohibition on  the  appellant  ever  regularising  her  status,
           thereby  contributing  significantly  to,  if  not   being   the
           predominant cause of,  her  status  as  an  overstayer,  thereby
           reducing the weight to be ascribed to the public interest in the
           maintenance of immigration controls on the facts of this matter.

        c. The appellant attributes the stress arising from the allegations
           and the consequential uncertainty of her immigration  status  to
           being the cause of a miscarriage.

40. I find it would be disproportionate for the appellant to be removed, at
    least until she has had the opportunity to attempt  to  regularise  her
    status with the benefit of having had her name cleared.  The respondent
    incorrectly accused  the  appellant  of  deception,  resulting  in  the
    curtailment of her leave and her subsequent  inability  to  attempt  to
    secure extensions to her leave or residence in another  capacity.   The
    appellant has suffered as a result of the  wrongful  operation  by  the
    respondent of her immigration functions.  It follows that the appellant
    should enjoy a period of leave, to be determined by the  respondent  in
    accordance with her undertakings to the Court of Appeal in Khan and her
    published policy, in which she can attempt to  regularise  her  status.
    Until the appellant has enjoyed at least that opportunity, it would  be
    disproportionate for her to be removed.

41. This appeal is allowed.

Co. Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr E. Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DECISION AND REASONS (V)

This has been a remote hearing which has been consented to  /  not  objected
to by the parties.  The form of remote hearing was  V  (video).  A  face  to
face hearing was not held because it was  not  practicable  and  all  issues
could be determined in a remote hearing.

The documents that I was referred to were the appellant's  and  respondent's
bundles from the  First-tier  Tribunal,  the  grounds  of  appeal,  and  the
decision of the First-tier Tribunal under appeal, the contents  of  which  I
have recorded.
The order made is described at the end of these reasons.

The parties said this about the process: they were content that it had  been
conducted fairly in its remote form.

 1. This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Page promulgated on 9 December 2019, dismissing an  appeal  brought  by
    the appellant against a decision of the respondent dated 12 June  2019,
    refusing her application for leave  to  remain  on  the  basis  of  her
    private life.

Factual background

 2. The appellant is Jasvir Kaur Brar, a citizen of India,  born  in  1989.
    She arrived in the United Kingdom in October 2010 as a student, and had
    her leave extended until 6 April 2015. However, on 11  September  2014,
    she was served with enforcement  papers  requiring  her  to  leave  the
    country.  Her leave had been curtailed on the basis that she had used a
    proxy test taker in an English language test at  New  College,  London,
    conducted on 1 May 2013. Although she attempted to appeal against  that
    decision at the time, her appeal was struck out. Thereafter, she made a
    number of EEA residence documentation applications, all of  which  were
    unsuccessful.  On 21 March 2019, she applied for leave to remain  based
    on her private life. That application was  refused,  and  it  was  that
    refusal decision which was under appeal before Judge Page.

 3. Judge Page found that the appellant was unable to satisfy  any  of  the
    private life provisions of the rules, and there has been  no  challenge
    to those findings.

 4. The focus of this appeal lies in the  findings  reached  by  the  judge
    concerning the respondent's allegations that the appellant  had  relied
    on a proxy test taker at a New College, London on 1 May 2013. The judge
    rejected the appellant's account of having taken the test  in  her  own
    capacity.

 5. The appellant  contends  that  the  judge's  credibility  analysis  was
    flawed, and that she has not had a fair assessment of whether she  did,
    in fact, use a proxy for the English language test. Her  case  is  that
    she did not use a proxy, and wishes to challenge the  judicial  finding
    of dishonesty which has been made against her.

 6. The judge's reasoning concerning  the  appellant's  account  of  having
    attended the test may be found at [23].  The judge noted that,  of  the
    56 people who attended the test centre that day, only four had not  had
    their test  cancelled  as  "invalid"  by  Educational  Testing  Service
    ("ETS"), the company  to  which  the  respondent  had  outsourced  some
    English language testing. The judge was concerned  that  the  appellant
    purported not to have seen anyone else cheating that day.  He  rejected
    that aspect of her case as not being credible. The judge then made  the
    following observation about the fact the appellant's case was that  she
    paid for the test in cash:

         "Cash payments on arrival were more likely to be required from  all
         those who are  to  use  a  proxy  test  taker,  as  cash  would  be
         untraceable in any criminal investigation of bank statements etc."

     Later in the same paragraph, the judge accepted that the appellant  had
    attended the test centre on 1 May 2013, but that she had paid  in  cash
    for a proxy to take the test on her behalf.

Permission to appeal

 7. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal  Judge  Sheridan  on
    the basis that it was arguable that there was  no  logical  reason,  or
    reason that could be discerned from any of the evidence that  had  been
    before the judge, as to why an individual cheating in  the  test  would
    not want their payment to the test centre to be traced, in contrast  to
    the  likely  position  in  relation  to  the  person  or   organisation
    responsible for the fraud. Secondly, it was  arguable  that  the  judge
    failed to  consider,  when  finding  it  damaging  to  the  appellant's
    credibility that she did not observe suspicious activity  on  the  day,
    that a person who had no reason to be interested in the conduct of test
    takers may not have noticed, or  paid  attention,  to  what  they  were
    doing.

Discussion

 8. This is a case  which  concerns  allegations  of  widespread  fraud  at
    English language testing centres administered by or on behalf of ETS. A
    considerable amount  of  jurisprudence  has  developed  concerning  the
    respondent's approach to such allegations. For  present  purposes,  the
    relevant principles are not in issue. It  is  common  ground  that  the
    respondent provided the appellant with sufficient  evidence  so  as  to
    shift the evidential burden to her,  such  that  she  was  expected  to
    provide  an  "innocent  explanation"  in   response   to   refute   the
    allegations. This case concerns the judge's  factual  analysis  of  the
    "innocent explanation" proffered by the appellant.

 9. It was common ground at the Upper Tribunal hearing that the  judge  had
    no evidential basis upon which to conclude that the appellant's payment
    in cash for the test was  more  likely  to  have  meant  that  she  had
    deployed, or relied upon, a proxy test taker. While there were a number
    of summaries of the criminal investigations conducted on behalf of  the
    respondent into the allegations of  widespread  teaching  at  ETS  test
    centres that had been provided to the judge, none  of  those  summaries
    said anything concerning the link between cash payments made by a  test
    taker and the  use  of  proxy  test  takers.   The  supposed  link  was
    speculation on the part of the judge.

10. Accordingly, the judge  gave  weight  to  an  immaterial  matter.   The
    judge's analysis concerning the use of cash was also  irrational.   The
    appellant herself would, by definition, have no desire for her  payment
    to the test centre or identity to be concealed.  The  test  certificate
    was issued to her, in her name. The judge also accepted the appellant's
    account that she attended the test  centre  on  the  day  in  question,
    meaning that the judge could not have been attempting  to  refer  to  a
    situation where he found that the appellant had not  attended  at  all,
    and had sent an impostor on her behalf.

11. Mr Tufan realistically conceded that the judge fell into error  on  the
    above issue, and that the entire  credibility  assessment  was  flawed.
    That was  an  appropriate  concession.   While  appeals  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal lie only on a point of  fact  rather  than  a  point  of  law,
    pursuant to R (Iran) v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
    [2005] EWCA Civ 982 at [9]  certain  errors  of  fact  are  capable  of
    amounting to an error of law.  The errors  identified  above  are  such
    errors, in that the judge reached a perverse finding, not supported  by
    the evidence.

12. Although the  unchallenged  findings  of  the  judge  relating  to  the
    appellant's private life mean that  this  was  an  appeal  which  would
    always fall to be dismissed, the  appellant  has  been  found  to  have
    engaged in dishonest conduct on the basis of a flawed assessment by the
    First-tier Tribunal. Such a finding has the potential to carry with  it
    profound consequences, affecting the appellant for many years to  come.
    It is necessary, therefore, for this tribunal to rehear the appellant's
    evidence concerning her claimed "innocent explanation" in  response  to
    the respondent's evidence that  she  cheated,  in  order  for  a  fresh
    assessment to take place.

13. I preserve the judge's unchallenged findings that the appellant did not
    meet the requirements of the private life provisions of the Immigration
    Rules, nor that there were any reasons outside the rules for the appeal
    to be allowed, at  the  time  of  the  hearing  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal on 19 November 2019.

14. The matter will be re-determined in the Upper Tribunal in order  for  a
    fresh assessment to be conducted of the respondent's  allegations  that
    the appellant used a proxy test taker in a test at New College,  London
    on 1 May 2013.

15. In GM (Sri Lanka) v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2019]
    EWCA Civ 1630 at [7], the Court of Appeal said:

         "...if an appellate court finds that  a  lower  court  or  tribunal
         acted lawfully by reference to the  evidence  before  it  but  that
         based upon the facts now known to the appeal court  to  uphold  the
         decision would violate fundamental norms, then the appellate  court
         must ensure that the decision it takes is compliant with the law."

    Although Judge Page's findings  concerning  the  applicability  of  the
    private life provisions of the Immigration Rules to the appellant  have
    not been challenged, it will still be necessary at the resumed  hearing
    to perform a contemporary assessment of those issues.

Postscript

16. Ideally, the appellant's evidence concerning the test  on  1  May  2013
    would have been re-heard at the hearing on 22 September 2020.  However,
    the appellant was not in attendance.  Mr Rai informed me  that  he  had
    advised the appellant that it was not necessary  to  attend.   That  is
    surprising, as the Directions issued by the Upper  Tribunal  upon  this
    matter being listed stated, at [4]:

         "There is a presumption that, in the event of the Tribunal deciding
         that the decision of the FTT is to be set  aside  as  erroneous  in
         law, the re-making of the decision will  take  place  at  the  same
         hearing. The fresh decision will normally be based on the  evidence
         before the FTT and any further evidence  admitted  (see  [5]  below
         [concerning rule 15(2A)], together with the parties' arguments. The
         parties must be prepared accordingly in every case."

17. At my direction, efforts were made during the hearing  to  see  if  the
    appellant would be able to participate via a remote  video  link.   She
    was unable to do so. I was told that, understandably, she was taken  by
    surprise at the suggestion that she would have to give evidence. By the
    time her solicitors managed to speak to her, she was  travelling  in  a
    car. She had  not  had  the  opportunity  to  read  her  statement,  or
    otherwise prepare for the appeal. I decided that it would not  be  fair
    to  attempt  to  secure  the  appellant's  participation  under   those
    conditions, and as such directed that the matter be resumed on  another
    occasion to hear her evidence.

18. My provisional view  is  that  the  hearing  will  be  suitable  to  be
    conducted remotely.  Either party may make reasoned submissions to  the
    contrary within 14 days of being sent this decision.

19. There has been no application to reduce  further  evidence  under  rule
    15(2A) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.   If  the
    appellant wishes to make such an application, she must do so within  14
    days of being sent this decision.

Notice of Decision

The decision of Judge Page involved the making of an error  of  law  and  is
set aside.  His findings at [25] that "the appellant  has  been  in  the  UK
without leave to remain since 2014 and has  no  basis  to  remain  and  that
there are no exceptional circumstances to consider outside  the  rules"  are
preserved, in so far as that finding related to the position as at the  date
of the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal on 25 November 2019.

The decision will be remade in  the  Upper  Tribunal.   The  appellant  must
attend.

My provisional view is that the hearing will be  suitable  to  be  conducted
remotely.  Either party  may  make  reasoned  submissions  to  the  contrary
within 14 days of being sent this decision.

Any application for further evidence  under  rule  15(2A)  of  the  Tribunal
Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 must be made within 14 days  of  being
sent this decision.

No anonymity direction is made.
