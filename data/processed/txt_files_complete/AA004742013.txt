Representation
For the Appellant:     Mr S Rasul, Legal Representative (on 8 August)
                       Mr Z Malik, Counsel (on 17 June)
For the Respondent:    Ms E Martin, Senior Home  Office  Presenting  Officer
                       (on 8 August)
                       Mr L Tarlow, Senior Home  Office  Presenting  Officer
                       (on 17 June)

Details of appellant and basis of claim

   1.       This appeal comes before me following the grant of permission on
      22 April 2013  by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Deans  in  respect  of  the
      determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge Broe dismissing the  appeal
      of the appellant following a hearing at Hatton Cross  on  15  February
      2013.

   2.       The appellant is an Indian national born on  2  April  1960.  He
      appeals against the decision of the respondent on 9  January  2013  to
      give directions for his removal and to refuse  his  asylum  and  human
      rights claim.

   3.       The appellant did not pursue his asylum claim at the hearing but
      relied upon Article 8 in terms of his  private  life  and  the  legacy
      policy. No anonymity order was made by the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      and none was sought then or before the Upper Tribunal.

   4.       The grounds argue that the judge erred in considering the appeal
      under the new Immigration Rules when he should have assessed it  under
      the old rules, the application having been made prior to 9 July  2012.
      It is argued that the appellant has completed 14 years'  residence  in
      the UK and that his appeal should have been allowed.

 Appeal hearings

   5.       The appeal first came before me on 17 June 2013.  The  appellant
      was present on that occasion as he was when the hearing resumed  on  8
      August. The submissions were translated to him with the assistance  of
      the court interpreter.

   6.       I heard submissions from Mr Malik who expanded  on  his  grounds
      and referred  me  to  the  implementation  section  of  HC  194  which
      supported  his  submission  that  the  application  should  have  been
      considered under paragraph 276B(i)(b) of the  old  rules  rather  than
      under 276ADE. In the absence of any evidence from the respondent  that
      any earlier notice  of  liability  to  removal  had  been  served,  he
      submitted that the appellant had shown that he had spent more than  14
      years in the UK (from November 1995 when he arrived until the  service
      of the IS 151A in January 2013). His appeal should be allowed.

   7.       Mr Tarlow sought time to make enquires as to whether a  previous
      IS 151A had been served and on the resumption of the hearing confirmed
      that whilst there was nothing to be found on the Home Office database,
      the port should  have a record as the appellant had been  recorded  as
      an absconder. He sought an adjournment in order to make  enquiries  of
      the port and to obtain any evidence that may exist.

   8.        Mr  Malik  opposed  the  adjournment  on  the  basis  that  the
      respondent had had time to provide such evidence and had not done  so.
      He submitted that if I disagreed with him on that, I should set  aside
      the determination of the First-tier Tribunal Judge in any event as  he
      had made an error of law by dealing with  the  appeal  under  the  old
      rules.

   9.       I considered that setting aside the determination at this  stage
      was premature as if Mr Tarlow's enquiries revealed that an IS 151A had
      been served earlier, then regardless of the judge's error the  outcome
      of the appeal would remain the same. I considered that  the  issue  of
      whether such a notice had been served was crucial to the appeal and  I
      therefore granted the  adjournment  notwithstanding  the  respondent's
      tardiness at submitting such evidence earlier.   A date of  8  August,
      that being the first available date, was obtained.

  10.       At the resumed hearing  the  appellant  was  represented  by  Mr
      Rasul. Ms Martin represented the respondent. She submitted a  computer
      print out to show  that  the  appellant  had  been  served  notice  of
      liability to removal as an illegal clandestine at the ASU on 17  April
      1996 (i.e. at the time of his interview) by I McDonald, authorised  by
      R Ingham.

  11.       I then heard submissions. Mr Rasul argued that the  judge  erred
      in considering the new rules and  that  Article  8  should  have  been
      considered.

  12.       Ms Martin  submitted  that  there  was  no  error  of  law.  She
      submitted it was immaterial that the  judge  had  considered  the  new
      rules because he had also considered Article 8 and applied the  Razgar
      test. He accepted the appellant had a private  life  here  and  in  so
      doing took note of his residence here but concluded that  removal  was
      proportionate because the appellant had a wife and children  in  India
      whom he continued to support, that he could be reunited with them  and
      that he would be able to receive medical treatment  if  necessary  for
      his high blood pressure in  India.  She  submitted  that  despite  the
      argument in the permission to appeal application that  paragraph  276B
      should have been considered, that had not been part of the appellant's
      grounds of appeal to the Tribunal and so the judge  could  not  be  in
      error for failing to consider a case that was never argued before him.
      However, in any event his failure to do so did not matter because  the
      appellant had been served as an illegal clandestine on 17 April  1996.
      The clock stopped then  as  the  old  rules  excluded  the  period  of
      residence following service of liability to removal.

  13.       Mr Rasul then asked for an opportunity to take instructions from
      the  appellant.  This  was  granted.  He  then  submitted   that   the
      appellant's instructions were that he had not received any notice.  He
      also queried why it had not been served at the last hearing  to  which
      Ms Martin replied that the appellant had not raised paragraph 276B  as
      an issue before the First-tier Tribunal  and  so  there  had  been  no
      necessity to supply the evidence of service.

  14.       Mr Rasul then requested  more  time  to  take  instructions  and
      consult his colleagues. I agreed to put the case to  the  back  of  my
      list so as to allow him the time he sought.

  15.       On resuming the hearing, Mr Rasul submitted that  he  relied  on
      the grounds for permission to appeal. He argued that the  respondent's
      evidence did not bear any signature and when it was pointed out to him
      that it was a computer printout he replied that  "anyone"  could  have
      printed something like this. He then  adduced  a  copy  of  EB  Kosovo
      [2008] UKHL 41 and argued that there had been a delay in the  decision
      making which had disadvantaged  the  appellant  because  the  previous
      rules may have been more supportive. He concluded his  submissions  by
      relying on the grounds.

  16.       Ms Martin asked to respond. She submitted that the  delay  point
      did not assist the appellant given the service of the notice  and  the
      fact that it was accepted that the new rules  did  not  apply  to  the
      appellant's case. She repeated that the appellant had  not  relied  on
      the long residency rule as part of  his  case  before  the  First-tier
      Tribunal. Even if he had, he was served with a notice of liability  to
      removal in 1996. The judge had considered Article 8  and  had  applied
      the Razgar test. It was open to him to make the findings he did.

  17.       Mr Rasul was given the opportunity to respond. He  chose  simply
      to rely on the grounds.

  18.       At the conclusion of the hearing  I  reserved  my  determination
      which I now give.

Findings and Conclusions

  19.       I have carefully considered all the evidence and the submissions
      of the parties before arriving at my decision.

  20.       The First-tier Tribunal Judge plainly erred in his consideration
      of the appellant's Article 8 claim in  that  he  relied  on  paragraph
      276ADE which was not in force when the appellant made his application.
      The transitional provisions make it clear that  any  application  made
      prior to July 2012 shall be decided under the old  Immigration  Rules.
      The appellant's  application  was  made  in  March  2009  so  the  new
      provisions of the rules with regard to Article 8 and private life were
      not applicable in this case.

  21.       I next consider whether this error is  such  that  the  decision
      should be set aside and re-made. I  find  that  it  is  not,  for  the
      following reasons.

  22.       The application made by the appellant was on  asylum  and  human
      rights grounds. There was no application made  under  the  Immigration
      Rules and paragraph 276B was not relied upon at all when the appellant
      lodged his appeal against the refusal of asylum. The submissions  made
      to the judge do not disclose any reliance upon it  either.  There  was
      therefore no obligation on the part  of  the  judge  to  consider  the
      Immigration Rules.

  23.       It could be  argued  that  notwithstanding  the  above,  if  the
      appellant had met the  requirements  of  the  rules  as  regards  long
      residency, that the judge should have considered that as part  of  the
      Article 8 balancing exercise. There are several points to be  made  in
      reply. First, residency alone does not mean  an  appellant  meets  the
      requirements of the rules. There is also a requirement that the public
      interest be considered and the respondent has raised the issue of  the
      appellant owing over �38,000 to the NHS. Second, given the service  of
      the notice of liability to removal (if that is accepted) the appellant
      could not have brought himself under the rules in  any  event.  Third,
      the judge did take into account that the appellant had been here since
      1995 when reaching his Article 8 conclusions.

  24.       Linked to the long residency argument is the  issue  of  whether
      and when the appellant was served with notice of liability to  removal
      or removal directions. Following the adjournment of the  last  hearing
      in June, the respondent has provided a computer print out to show that
      the appellant was served notice as an illegal clandestine on 17  April
      1996 when he had his  asylum  interview.  It  was  submitted  for  the
      appellant that he  had  not  received  it  and  essentially  that  the
      respondent had fabricated the evidence. I do not accept that. If I  am
      to  decide  between  the  evidence  of  the  appellant  who  made   an
      unmeritorious asylum claim and then chose to  remain  here  unlawfully
      for over 14 years and the  Secretary  of  State  who  has  provided  a
      detailed computer print out confirming service, I have  no  hesitation
      in giving more weight  to  the  latter.  I  therefore  find  that  the
      appellant was made aware of his liability to removal when  he  claimed
      asylum and that he could not have met the  requirements  of  paragraph
      276B (i)(b) even if his application had been made and considered under
      that provision.

  25.       The argument made  under  EB  Kosovo,  that  the  delay  in  the
      decision making took away from the appellant  the  right  to  make  an
      application under the long residency requirements of  the  old  rules,
      falls away as a result of my finding that the appellant was served  as
      an illegal in 1996. The delay, which was considered by the judge,  did
      not disadvantage the appellant in that way as he had  never  indicated
      that he would have applied under the rules and in any event even if he
      had, he would not have succeeded. No other evidence  was  produced  or
      called to show  that  the  additional  three  years  strengthened  the
      appellant's ties to the UK in any way. This is the only criticism made
      of the judge's Article 8 findings. No challenge is made to  the  other
      reasons   given   for   the   conclusion   that   removal   was    not
      disproportionate.

  26.       Finally, Mr Rasul argued that the  appellant  should  have  been
      permitted to remain under the legacy policy. This, however, is not  an
      issue that was raised in the permission application.   In  any  event,
      it is unclear why the legacy policy would apply to the appellant given
      that he did not  have  an  outstanding  asylum  application;  his  was
      decided before the policy came into effect.

  27.       In conclusion, whilst I accept that the judge was wrong to  have
      found the respondent had properly  applied  paragraph  276ADE  to  the
      appellant's case,  I have found for the reasons  set  out  above  that
      this error does not invalidate his decision and require that I set  it
      aside.

Decision

  28.       The First-tier Tribunal did not make an error of law  such  that
      requires the determination to be set aside and the judge's decision to
      dismiss the appeal is to stand.
