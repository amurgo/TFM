                                     and

                           ENTRY CLEARANCE OFFICER
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr Z. Raza, instructed by Marks & Marks Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr E. Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    The appellant appealed the respondent's decision dated  14  July  2016
    to refuse to issue a family permit facilitating entry to the UK as  the
    'extended family member' of an  EEA  national  with  reference  to  The
    Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 ("EEA Regulations
    2006"). The appellant is the brother of a Portuguese  national  who  is
    exercising his rights of free movement under the EU treaties in the UK.



2.    The appeal was initially dismissed for lack of jurisdiction  following
    the Upper Tribunal decision in Sala (EFMs: right of appeal) [2016] UKUT
    00411 in a decision promulgated on 09 August 2017. Following the  Court
    of Appeal decision in Khan v SSHD [2017] EWCA Civ 1755 it was set aside
    by a judge of the First-tier Tribunal in a decision promulgated  on  26
    October 2018.

3.    First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  E.B.  Grant  ("the  judge")  subsequently
    dismissed the appeal in a decision promulgated on 15  March  2019.  She
    was satisfied that there was  sufficient  evidence  to  show  that  the
    appellant was related to the  EEA  sponsor  as  claimed.  However,  she
    dismissed the appeal because she  was  not  satisfied  that  there  was
    sufficient evidence to show that the appellant  was  dependent  on  the
    sponsor.

4.    In a decision promulgated on 06 June 2019 (annexed)  a  panel  of  the
    Upper Tribunal (UTJ Canavan and UTJ Pickup) found that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal decision involved the making of an error of law.  The  judge's
    finding relating to the familial relationship was preserved.  The  case
    was adjourned for up to date evidence to  be  served.  The  appeal  now
    comes before the Upper Tribunal  for  the  decision  to  be  remade  in
    relation to the issue of dependency.

Legal framework

The Citizens Directive

5.    Recitals 5 and 6 of the  Directive  say  the  following  about  family
    members.

         '(5)     The right of all Union citizens to move and reside  freely
         within the territory of the Member States should, if it  is  to  be
         exercised under objective conditions of  freedom  and  dignity,  be
         also granted to their family members, irrespective of  nationality.
         For the purposes of  this  Directive,  the  definition  of  'family
         member'  should  also  include  the  registered  partner   if   the
         legislation of the host Member State treats registered  partnership
         as equivalent to marriage.

         (6)      In order to maintain the unity of the family in a  broader
         sense and without prejudice to the prohibition of discrimination on
         grounds of nationality, the situation of those persons who are  not
         included in the definition of family members under this  Directive,
         and who therefore do not enjoy an  automatic  right  of  entry  and
         residence in the host Member State, should be examined by the  host
         Member State on the basis of its own national legislation, in order
         to decide whether entry and residence  could  be  granted  to  such
         persons, taking into  consideration  their  relationship  with  the
         Union citizen or any other circumstances, such as  their  financial
         or physical dependence on the Union citizen.'

6.    Article 2 sets out the following definitions.

         'For the purposes of this Directive:

         1. 'Union citizen' means any person having  the  nationality  of  a
             Member State;

         2. 'family member' means:

             (a) the spouse;

             (b) the partner with whom the Union citizen has  contracted  a
                  registered partnership, on the basis of the legislation of
                  a Member State, if the  legislation  of  the  host  Member
                  State treats  registered  partnerships  as  equivalent  to
                  marriage and in accordance with the conditions  laid  down
                  in the relevant legislation of the host Member State;

             (c) the direct descendants who are under the age of 21 or  are
                  dependants and those of the spouse or partner  as  defined
                  in point (b);

             (d) the dependent direct relatives in the ascending  line  and
                  those of the spouse or partner as defined in point (b);

         3. 'host Member State' means the Member  State  to  which  a  Union
             citizen moves in order  to  exercise  his/her  right  of  free
             movement and residence.'

7.    Article 3 provides.

         '1.      This Directive shall apply to all Union citizens who  move
             to or reside in a Member State other than that of  which  they
             are a national, and to their  family  members  as  defined  in
             point 2 of Article 2 who accompany or join them.

         2. Without prejudice to any right to free  movement  and  residence
             the persons concerned may have in their own  right,  the  host
             Member  State  shall,  in   accordance   with   its   national
             legislation, facilitate entry and residence for the  following
             persons:

             (a)  any  other  family   members,   irrespective   of   their
                  nationality, not falling under the definition in  point  2
                  of Article 2 who, in the  country  from  which  they  have
                  come, are dependants or members of the  household  of  the
                  Union citizen having the primary right  of  residence,  or
                  where serious health grounds strictly require the personal
                  care of the family member by the Union citizen;

             (b) the partner with whom the  Union  citizen  has  a  durable
                  relationship, duly attested.

             The host Member State shall undertake an extensive examination
             of the personal circumstances and shall justify any denial  of
             entry or residence to these people.'

The EEA Regulations 2006

8.    The relevant part of regulation 8 of the EEA Regulations 2006 was:

         '8.      (1)  In these Regulations "extended family member" means a
                  person who is not a family member of an EEA national under
                  regulation 7(1)(a), (b)  or  (c)  and  who  satisfies  the
                  conditions in paragraph (2), (3), (4) or (5).

             (2) A person satisfies the condition in this paragraph if  the
                  person is a relative of an EEA national, his spouse or his
                  civil partner and-

                  (a)  the person is residing in a country  other  than  the
                      United Kingdom and is dependent upon the EEA national
                      or is a member of his household;

                  (b)  the person satisfied the condition in  paragraph  (a)
                      and is accompanying the EEA national  to  the  United
                      Kingdom or wishes to join him there; or

                  (c)  the person satisfied the condition in paragraph  (a),
                      has joined the EEA national in the United Kingdom and
                      continues to be dependent upon him or to be a  member
                      of his household. .....'

Case law

9.    In Lebon C-316/85 [1987] ECR 2811 the European Court of Justice  (ECJ)
    concluded that the status of dependent family  member  results  from  a
    factual situation, namely the  provision  of  support  by  the  worker,
    without there being any need to determine the reasons for  recourse  to
    the worker's support.

10.   In Jia v Migrationsverket  [2007]  INLR  336  the  European  Court  of
    Justice  made  the  following  findings  relating  to  the  meaning  of
    dependency within the context of an application  made  by  a  dependent
    direct family member in the ascending line of the  European  national's
    spouse.

         "35.     According to the case law of the  Court  of  Justice,  the
             status of "dependent" family member is the result of a factual
             situation characterised by the fact that material support  for
             that family member is provided by the Community  national  who
             has exercised his  right  of  free  movement  or  his  spouse:
             see...Lebon...and...Zhu and Chen...

         36.      The court has also  held  that  the  status  of  dependent
             family member does not presuppose the existence of a right  of
             maintenance, otherwise that status would  depend  on  national
             legislation, which varies from one case to another: (Lebon...)
             According to the court there  is  no  need  to  determine  the
             reasons for recourse to that support or to raise the  question
             whether the person concerned is able  to  support  himself  by
             taking up paid employment. That interpretation is dictated  in
             particular by the principle according to which the  provisions
             establishing the free movement of  workers,  which  constitute
             one of the foundations of the  Community,  must  be  construed
             broadly (Lebon ...).

         37.      In  order  to  determine  whether  the  relatives  in  the
             ascending line of the  spouse  of  a  Community  national  are
             dependent on the latter, the host  Member  State  must  assess
             whether,  having  regard  to  their   financial   and   social
             conditions, they are not in a position to support  themselves.
             The need for material support  must  exist  in  the  State  of
             origin of those relatives or the State whence they came at the
             time when they apply to join the Community national."

         ....

         43.      In those circumstances, the answer to  Question  2(a)  and
             (b) must be that Article 1(1)(d) of Directive 73/148 is to  be
             interpreted to the effect that 'dependent on them' means  that
             members of the family of a Community national  established  in
             another Member State within the meaning of Article 43 EC  need
             the material support of that Community national or his or  her
             spouse in order to meet their essential needs in the State  of
             origin of those family members or the State  from  which  they
             have come at the time when they apply to  join  the  Community
             national. Article 6(b) of that directive must  be  interpreted
             as meaning that proof of the need for material support may  be
             adduced by any appropriate means,  while  a  mere  undertaking
             from the Community national or his or her  spouse  to  support
             the  family  members  concerned  need  not  be   regarded   as
             establishing the existence of the family members' situation of
             real dependence."

11.   In SM (India) v Entry Clearance Officer (Mumbai) [2009] EWCA Civ  1426
    the Court of Appeal made the following observations.

         "26.     For the sake of completeness, I should  mention  the  fact
             that, although Mr Palmer invited the court to apply  the  test
             for dependency that is set out in Jia, he made it clear in the
             respondent's skeleton  argument  that,  in  the  Secretary  of
             State's  submission  the  question  whether  the   applicants'
             essential needs are met because of the material support of the
             Union citizen (or his or her spouse or civil partner) needs to
             be approached with care and is in any  event  subject  to  the
             qualification that Community law cannot  be  relied  upon  for
             abusive or fraudulent ends. Thus a person who is in a position
             to support himself  because,  for  example,  he  has  adequate
             savings or a sufficient income but who nevertheless chooses to
             live off a Union citizen's contributions because he prefers to
             keep his savings intact or to invest his income, would not, in
             the Secretary of State's submission, be  someone  who  was  in
             need of material support. A  person  who  artificially  placed
             himself in a position of dependency on a Union citizen for the
             sole purpose of obtaining an immigration  advantage,  although
             he might then be in need of support, would  be  excluded  from
             relying on the Directive by the  application  of  the  general
             principle in Community  law  that  its  provisions  cannot  be
             relied on for abusive or  fraudulent  ends.  The  example  was
             given in this context of an  applicant  who  had  deliberately
             given up employment or some other source of income or who  had
             divested himself of assets which would have made  recourse  to
             support from the Union citizen unnecessary.

         27.      Since those issues have not previously been raised in  the
             present proceedings, I would prefer to express no view  as  to
             whether these two further  submissions  of  the  Secretary  of
             State are well-founded. The "fraud or abuse" exception is well-
             established in principle in community law, but its application
             to dependency cases should  be  considered  in  the  light  of
             specific and sufficiently detailed findings  of  fact  by  the
             AIT. Considering the matter in the abstract, it is possible to
             see a distinction between  a  person  who,  for  example,  has
             sufficient savings or income but prefers to  rely  on  support
             from a Union citizen and a person who could work and  earn  an
             income but who prefers not to do so and  to  rely  on  support
             from a Union citizen. In the  former  case  the  Secretary  of
             State would contend that there was simply no need for material
             support to meet essential needs, whereas in  the  latter  case
             there is a need as a matter of fact and it is  unnecessary  to
             explore the reasons for the applicant's recourse to support.

         28.      In reality, people's circumstances, their lives and  their
             lifestyles are not always quite so  straightforward,  and  any
             attempt to draw a bright line between determining  whether  an
             applicant  has  a  need  for  material  support  to  meet  his
             "essential needs" and where there is recourse to  support,  it
             being unnecessary to determine the reasons for that  recourse,
             is best considered not on the basis of  hypothetical  examples
             but on a case-by-case basis, with the  benefit  of  clear  and
             sufficient factual findings by the AIT. I would  therefore  go
             no further than to say that the test for dependency is  to  be
             found in Lebon, read together with Jia, and insofar as AP  and
             FP decided that  the  latter  had  effectively  overruled  the
             former, it was wrongly decided and should not be followed."

12.   The headnote of the Upper  Tribunal  decision  in  VN  (EEA  rights  -
    dependency) Macedonia  [2010]  UKUT  380  summarised  the  findings  as
    follows:

         "The judgment in Pedro [2009] EWCA Civ  1358  establishes  that  in
         respect of family members who are  dependent  direct  relatives  as
         defined  by  Article  2.2(d)  of  Directive  2004/38/EC,  proof  of
         dependence in the  host  Member  State  (the  United  Kingdom)  can
         suffice for them to qualify for a right of residence. However, this
         judgment does not have application to the  case  of  "Other  family
         members" (OFMs) as defined by Article 3.2(a) of the  Directive.  In
         order to establish a right of residence the latter are required  to
         show both dependence in the country from which they have  come  and
         dependence in the UK."

13.   The headnote  in  Moneke  (EEA  -  OFMs)  Nigeria  [2011]  UKUT  00341
    summarised the Upper Tribunal's findings as follows:

         "i.      A person claiming to be  an  OFM  under  Article  3(2)  of
             Directive 2004/38/EC may either be a dependant or a member  of
             the household of the EEA national: they are  alternative  ways
             of qualifying as an OFM.

         ii.      In  either  case  the  dependency  or  membership  of  the
             household must be on a person who is an EEA  national  at  the
             material time. For this reason it is essential  that  tribunal
             judges establish when the sponsor acquired EEA nationality.

         iii.     By contrast with Article 2(2) family members, an OFM  must
             show qualification  as  such  before  arrival  in  the  United
             Kingdom and the application to join the EEA  national  who  is
             resident here.

         iv.      Membership of a household has the meaning set  out  in  KG
             (Sri Lanka) [2008] EWCA Civ 13 and Bigia & Ors [2009] EWCA Civ
             79; that is to say it imports living for some period  of  time
             under the roof of a household that can be said to be  that  of
             the  EEA  national  for  a  time  when  he  or  she  had  such
             nationality.  That  necessarily  requires   that   whilst   in
             possession of such nationality the  family  member  has  lived
             somewhere in  the  world  in  the  same  country  as  the  EEA
             national, but not necessarily in an EEA state.

         v. By contrast the dependency on an EEA national can be  dependency
             as a result of  the  material  remittances  sent  by  the  EEA
             national to the family member, without the pair of them having
             lived in the same country at that  time  before  making  those
             remittances.

         vi.      The country from which the OFM has come can be either  the
             country from which he or she has come to the United Kingdom or
             his or her country of origin.

         ...

         viii.    Where relevant, findings need also to be made  on  whether
             it is appropriate to issue a residence card in accordance with
             the discretion afforded by regulation 17(4) of the Immigration
             (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006.

         ix.      In deciding whether a person  falls  within  the  material
             scope  of  regulation  8  of  the  2006  Regulations,   policy
             considerations relating to such  matters  as  the  appellant's
             immigration history, the impact of an adverse decision on  the
             exercise by the EEA national of his or her Treaty rights,  etc
             are  irrelevant.  Such  policy  considerations  are  relevant,
             however, to the exercise of regulation 17(4) discretion."

14.   In SSHD v Rahman [2013] QB 249 the  Grand  Chamber  of  the  Court  of
    Justice of the European Union (CJEU)  considered  the  case  of  'other
    family members' of an EEA  national  who  were  relatives  of  the  EEA
    national's spouse. The focus of the decision was  to  answer  questions
    relating to the assessment of dependency of other family  members.  The
    court made the following findings:

         "19.     As contended  by  the  governments  which  have  submitted
             observations to the Court and by the European  Commission,  it
             follows both from the wording of  Article  3(2)  of  Directive
             2004/38 and from the general system of the directive that  the
             European legislature has drawn a distinction between  a  Union
             citizen's  family  members  as  defined  in  Article  2(2)  of
             Directive  2004/38,  who  enjoy,  as  provided  for   in   the
             directive, a  right  of  entry  into  and  residence  in  that
             citizen's host Member State,  and  the  other  family  members
             envisaged in Article 3(2) of the directive,  whose  entry  and
             residence has only to be facilitated by that Member State.

         20.      That interpretation is borne  out  by  recital  6  in  the
             preamble to Directive 2004/38 ...

         21.      Whilst it is  therefore  apparent  that  Article 3(2)  of
             Directive 2004/38 does not oblige the Member States to  accord
             a right of entry and  residence  to  persons  who  are  family
             members, in the broad sense, dependent on a Union citizen, the
             fact remains, as is clear from the use  of  the  words  'shall
             facilitate' in Article 3(2), that that provision  imposes  an
             obligation on the Member States to confer a certain advantage,
             compared with applications for entry and  residence  of  other
             nationals  of  third  States,  on  applications  submitted  by
             persons who have a relationship of particular dependence  with
             a Union citizen.

         22.      In order to meet that obligation, the Member States  must,
             in accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 3(2) of
             Directive 2004/38, make it possible for persons  envisaged  in
             the first subparagraph of Article 3(2) to obtain a decision on
             their application that is founded on an extensive  examination
             of their personal circumstances and, in the event of  refusal,
             is justified by reasons.

         23.      As is clear from recital 6 in the preamble  to  Directive
             2004/38, it is incumbent upon the  competent  authority,  when
             undertaking  that  examination  of  the  applicant's  personal
             circumstances, to take account of the various factors that may
             be relevant in the particular case,  such  as  the  extent  of
             economic or physical dependence and the degree of relationship
             between the family member and the Union citizen whom he wishes
             to accompany or join.

         24.      In the light both of the absence of more specific rules in
             Directive 2004/38 and of the use of the words  'in  accordance
             with  its  national  legislation'  in  Article  3(2)  of   the
             directive, each Member State has a wide discretion as  regards
             the selection of the factors to be taken  into  account.  None
             the  less,  the  host  Member  State  must  ensure  that   its
             legislation contains criteria which are  consistent  with  the
             normal meaning of the  term  'facilitate'  and  of  the  words
             relating to dependence used in Article 3(2), and which do  not
             deprive that provision of its effectiveness."

15.   In assessing further questions relating to dependency  the  CJEU  said
    the following about the objective of Article 3(2) of the Directive.

         "32.     So far as concerns the time at which the applicant must be
             in a situation of dependence  in  order  to  be  considered  a
             'dependant' within the meaning of Article 3(2)  of  Directive
             2004/38, it is to be noted that, as follows from recital 6 in
             the directive's preamble, the objective of that  provision  is
             to 'maintain the unity of the family in a  broader  sense'  by
             facilitating entry and  residence  for  persons  who  are  not
             included in the definition of family member of a Union citizen
             contained  in  Article 2(2)  of  Directive  2004/38  but  who
             nevertheless maintain close and  stable  family  ties  with  a
             Union citizen on account of  specific  factual  circumstances,
             such as economic dependence, being a member of  the  household
             or serious health grounds."

16.   In Reyes (EEA Regs: dependency) [2013] UKUT 00314 the  Upper  Tribunal
    considered the question of dependency of a relative of an EEA  national
    in the ascending line (the EEA national's father) was dependent for the
    purpose of regulation 7(1)(c) of the EEA Regulations  2006.  The  Upper
    Tribunal reviewed relevant case law and concluded:

         "19.     From the above, we glean four key things. First, the  test
             of dependency is a purely  factual  test.  Second,  the  Court
             envisages that questions of dependency must not be reduced  to
             a bare calculation  of  financial  dependency  but  should  be
             construed broadly to  involve  a  holistic  examination  of  a
             number of factors, including financial,  physical  and  social
             conditions, so as to establish  whether  there  is  dependence
             that is genuine. The essential focus has to be on  the  nature
             of the  relationship  concerned  and  on  whether  it  is  one
             characterised  by  a  situation  of  dependence  based  on  an
             examination of all the factual circumstances, bearing in  mind
             the underlying objective  of  maintaining  the  unity  of  the
             family. It seems to us that the need for a wide-ranging  fact-
             specific approach is indeed enjoined by the Court of Appeal in
             SM (India): see in particular Sullivan  LJ's  observations  at
             [27]-[28]. Third, it is clear from the wording of both Article
             2.2 and regulation 7(1) that the test is one of  present,  not
             past dependency. Both  provisions  employ  the  present  tense
             (Article 2.2(b) and (c)  refer  to  family  members  who  "are
             dependants" or who are "dependent"; regulation 7(c) refers  to
             "dependent direct relatives..."). Fourth (and  this  may  have
             relevance  to  what  is  understood  by  present  dependency),
             interpretation of the meaning of the term must be such as  not
             to deprive that provision of its effectiveness."

17.   In Flora May Reyes v Migrationsverket EU:C:2014:16 the Fourth  Chamber
    of the CJEU considered  the  issue  of  dependency  in  relation  to  a
    dependent direct family member who  was  over  21  years  old  for  the
    purpose of Article 2 of the Directive and made the following findings:

         "19.     By its  first  question,  the  referring  court  asks,  in
             essence, whether Article 2(2)(c) of Directive 2004/38 is to be
             interpreted as  permitting  a  Member  State  to  require,  in
             circumstances  such  as  those  in  question   in   the   main
             proceedings, that, in order to be regarded as being  dependent
             and thus to come within the definition of 'family member'  set
             out in that provision, a direct descendant who is 21 years old
             or older must show that he has tried without success  to  find
             employment  or  to  obtain  subsistence   support   from   the
             authorities of the country of origin and/or otherwise tried to
             support himself.

         20.      In that regard, it must be noted  that,  in  order  for  a
             direct descendant, who is 21 years old or older,  of  a  Union
             citizen to be regarded as being a 'dependant' of that  citizen
             within the meaning of Article 2(2)(c)  of  Directive  2004/38,
             the existence of  a  situation  of  real  dependence  must  be
             established (see, to that effect, Jia, paragraph 42).

         21.      That dependent status is the result of a factual situation
             characterised by the  fact  that  material  support  for  that
             family member  is  provided  by  the  Union  citizen  who  has
             exercised his right of free movement or by his spouse (see, to
             that effect, Jia, paragraph 35).

         22.      In order to determine the existence  of  such  dependence,
             the host Member State must assess whether,  having  regard  to
             his financial and social conditions,  the  direct  descendant,
             who is 21 years old or older, of a Union citizen, is not in  a
             position to support himself. The  need  for  material  support
             must exist in the State of origin of that  descendant  or  the
             State whence he came at the time when he applies to join  that
             citizen (see, to that effect, Jia, paragraph 37).

         23.      However, there is no need to  determine  the  reasons  for
             that dependence or therefore for the recourse to that support.
             That interpretation is dictated in particular by the principle
             according to which the provisions, such as Directive 2004/38,
             establishing  the  free  movement  of  Union  citizens,  which
             constitute one of the foundations of the European Union,  must
             be construed broadly (see, to that effect, Jia,  paragraph  36
             and the case-law cited).

         24.      The fact that, in circumstances such as those in  question
             in the main proceedings, a  Union  citizen  regularly,  for  a
             significant period, pays a sum of money  to  that  descendant,
             necessary in order for him to support himself in the State  of
             origin, is such as to show that the descendant is  in  a  real
             situation of dependence vis-�-vis that citizen.

         25.       In  those  circumstances,  that  descendant   cannot   be
             required, in addition, to establish that he has tried  without
             success to find work or obtain subsistence  support  from  the
             authorities of his country of origin and/or otherwise tried to
             support himself."

18.   The CJEU went on to make the following findings relating to whether  a
    dependent direct relative ceased to become dependent if  they  intended
    to begin work

         "29.     By its second  question,  the  referring  court  asks,  in
             essence, whether, in  interpreting  the  term  'dependant'  in
             Article  2(2)(c)  of  Directive  2004/38,   any   significance
             attaches to the fact that a family member -  due  to  personal
             circumstances such as age, education and health - is deemed to
             be well placed to obtain employment and in addition intends to
             start work in the Member State,  which  would  mean  that  the
             conditions for him to be regarded  as  a  relative  who  is  a
             dependant under the provision are no longer met.

         30.      In that regard, it must be noted  that  the  situation  of
             dependence must exist, in the country from  which  the  family
             member concerned comes, at the time when he  applies  to  join
             the Union citizen on  whom  he  is  dependent  (see,  to  that
             effect, Jia, paragraph 37, and Case C-83/11 Rahman [2012] ECR,
             paragraph 33).

         31.      It follows that, as, in essence, has been  stated  by  all
             the parties which have submitted observations  to  the  Court,
             any prospects of obtaining work in the host Member State which
             would enable, if necessary, a direct  descendant,  who  is  21
             years old or older,  of  a  Union  citizen  no  longer  to  be
             dependent on that citizen once he has the right  of  residence
             are not such as to affect the interpretation of the  condition
             of being a 'dependant'  referred  to  in  Article  2(2)(c)  of
             Directive 2004/38.

         32.       Furthermore,  as  the  European  Commission  has  rightly
             pointed  out,  the  opposite  solution  would,  in   practice,
             prohibit that descendant from looking for  employment  in  the
             host Member State and would accordingly infringe Article 23 of
             that directive, which expressly authorises such a  descendant,
             if he has the right of residence, to  take  up  employment  or
             self-employment (see, by analogy, Lebon, paragraph 20).

         33.      In consequence, the answer to the second question is  that
             Article 2(2)(c) of Directive 2004/38 must  be  interpreted  as
             meaning that the fact  that  a  relative  -  due  to  personal
             circumstances such as age, education and health - is deemed to
             be well placed to obtain employment and in addition intends to
             start  work  in  the  Member  State  does   not   affect   the
             interpretation of the requirement in that provision that he be
             a 'dependant'."

19.   In Lim  v  ECO  (Manila)  [2016]  Imm  AR  421  the  Court  of  Appeal
    considered the CJEU decision in Reyes and found that it cast  doubt  on
    the analysis in the earlier decision of the Court of Appeal in Pedro  v
    SSHD [2009] EWCA Civ 1358. The court concluded:

         "25.     In my judgment, this makes it unambiguously clear that  it
             is not enough simply to show that financial support is in fact
             provided by the EU citizen to the  family  member.  There  are
             numerous  references  in  these  paragraphs  which  are   only
             consistent with a notion that the family member must need this
             support from his or her relatives in order to meet his or  her
             basic needs. For example, paragraph 20 refers to the existence
             of "a situation of real dependence" which must be established;
             paragraph 22 is even more striking and refers to the need  for
             material support in the state of origin of the descendant "who
             is not in a position to support  himself";  and  paragraph  24
             requires that financial support must be  "necessary"  for  the
             putative dependant to support himself in the state of  origin.
             It is also pertinent to note that  in  paragraph  22,  in  the
             context of  considering  the  Citizens  Directive,  the  court
             specifically approved the test adopted in Jia at paragraph 37,
             namely that:

                  "The need for material support must exist in the State  of
                  origin of those relatives or the State whence they came at
                  the time when they apply to join the Community national."

         ...

         32.      In my judgment,  the  critical  question  is  whether  the
             claimant is in fact in a position to support himself  or  not,
             and Reyes now makes that clear beyond doubt, in my view.  That
             is a simple matter of fact. If he can support  himself,  there
             is no dependency, even  if  he  is  given  financial  material
             support by the EU citizen. Those additional resources are  not
             necessary to enable him to meet his basic needs.  If,  on  the
             other hand, he cannot support himself from his own  resources,
             the court will not ask why that  is  the  case,  save  perhaps
             where there is an abuse of rights. The fact  that  he  chooses
             not to get a job and become self-supporting is irrelevant.  It
             follows  that  on  the  facts  of  this  case,  there  was  no
             dependency. The appellant had the funds  to  support  herself.
             She  was  financially  independent  and  did  not   need   the
             additional resources for the  purpose  of  meeting  her  basic
             needs."

Decision and reasons

20.   The following principles can be derived from the legal  framework  set
    out above.

    (i)    The Directive recognises that having to live  apart  from  close
         family members might  act  as  an  obstacle  to  European  citizens
         exercising rights under the Treaties.

    (ii)   The Directive makes a distinction between 'family  members'  who
         have a right of entry and residence in  a  host  Member  State  and
         'other  family  members'  whose  entry  and  residence  should   be
         facilitated by the host Member State.

    (iii)  The measure of whether a person is an 'other family member'  who
         should be facilitated entry is whether  they  maintain  "close  and
         stable family ties with a Union  citizen  on  account  of  specific
         factual circumstances, such as economic dependence, being a  member
         of the household or serious health grounds".

    (iv)   A person needs to show "a situation of real dependence"  on  the
         EEA national to meet their essential  needs.  If  a  person  cannot
         support himself or herself from their  own  resources,  it  is  not
         necessary to ask why, save in cases involving abuse of rights.  The
         fact that a person chooses not to work is irrelevant.

    (v)     The  competent  authority  in  the  host  Member  State,   when
         undertaking   an   examination   of   the   applicant's    personal
         circumstances, can take into account various factors  that  may  be
         relevant such as the extent of the economic or physical  dependence
         and the degree of relationship between the family  member  and  the
         Union citizen who they wish to accompany or join.

    (vi)   The host Member  State  has  a  wide  discretion  regarding  the
         selection of factors to be taken into account "in  accordance  with
         national legislation". Nevertheless, the  host  Member  State  must
         ensure that legislation is consistent with the  normal  meaning  of
         the term 'facilitate' and must not  deprive  Article  3(2)  of  its
         effectiveness.

    (vii)  Policy  considerations  may  be  relevant  to  the  respondent's
         exercise  of  discretion  to  issue  a  family  permit  (regulation
         12(2)(c)) or a residence card (regulation 17(4))  to  an  'extended
         family member' under the EEA Regulations 2006.

     (viii)      The exercise of discretion by the host Member  State  must
         be done in line with the provisions of the Charter  of  Fundamental
         Rights of the European Union.  In  particular,  Article  7  of  the
         Charter recognises the right to family life.

21.   I found the EEA  sponsor  to  be  a  credible  witness  who  gave  his
    evidence in an open  and  unhesitating  way.  The  appellant's  brother
    produced documentary evidence to support his claim that he has provided
    the appellant with  financial  support  since  his  jewellery  business
    closed in 2015. As set out  in  the  previous  decision  of  the  Upper
    Tribunal, there is evidence to show  that  the  sponsor  sends  regular
    remittances  to  the  appellant.  There  are  numerous  money  transfer
    receipts from the sponsor to the appellant to show that money  is  sent
    on a regular basis. The most recent evidence shows that he declared  an
    annual income of �22,407 in the last tax year (2018-2019). The  sponsor
    shares the costs of  his  accommodation  with  another  brother.  I  am
    satisfied that the evidence shows that  he  has  sufficient  income  to
    afford the remittances of around �600 a month albeit he admits it is  a
    struggle to do so. The appellant and the sponsor both  say  that  these
    funds are the appellant's only source of  income.  He  has  not  worked
    since his business closed  and  is  reliant  on  the  EEA  sponsor  for
    financial support. There is no evidence to suggest that  the  appellant
    has savings that he could draw on to meet his essential needs. The fact
    that he has not found work or attempted to set up  a  new  business  is
    immaterial if he is in a situation of  real  dependency  upon  the  EEA
    sponsor to meet his family's essential needs. I am satisfied  that  the
    evidence shows on the balance of probabilities that  the  appellant  is
    likely to be dependent upon the  EEA  sponsor  within  the  meaning  of
    regulation 8 of the EEA Regulations 2006.

22.   The EEA sponsor said that the appellant plans to join him in  the  UK,
    but his wife and children will remain in Pakistan.  He  said  that  the
    appellant would live with him in the UK, but intends to  seek  work  to
    support his family in Pakistan. It is to the EEA sponsor's credit  that
    he was open about  these  plans.  Although  I  am  satisfied  that  the
    appellant is in a situation of genuine financial  dependence  upon  the
    EEA national there is little evidence  to  suggest  that  the  familial
    relationship between the two adult relatives has any other elements  of
    dependency over and above  the  usual  relationship  one  might  expect
    between adult siblings in order to engage  the  right  to  respect  for
    family life. The appellant has a family in Pakistan and intends to join
    his brother in the UK to seek work. There is  no  evidence  to  suggest
    that  the  familial  relationship  between  the  EEA  sponsor  and  the
    appellant is of a 'close and stable' nature such that  their  continued
    separation might act as an obstacle to the EEA sponsor  being  able  to
    exercise his rights under the EU Treaties. The application  appears  to
    have been made in order  to  assist  the  appellant  to  gain  economic
    advantages in the UK to support his family rather than because there is
    a particularly close relationship between himself and the  EEA  sponsor
    requiring them to live together in the UK.

23.   I note that the CJEU decision in Reyes  found  that  it  mattered  not
    that a dependent direct relative who was over 21 years old intended  to
    find work in the UK. However, as in that case, much  of  the  case  law
    relating to dependency refers to  the  situation  of  dependent  direct
    relatives who were 'family members' with rights of residence as opposed
    to 'other family members' whose entry need only be facilitated if their
    continued separation from the EEA national might act as an obstacle  to
    the EEA national exercising their rights under  the  EU  treaties.  The
    appellant is not the 'family member' of an EEA national.

24.   The Directive makes clear that it  does  not  affect  more  favourable
    national provisions. Regulation 8 of  the  EEA  Regulations  2006  only
    requires the appellant to show that he is an extended family member who
    is dependent on the EEA national and intends to join his brother in the
    UK. I am satisfied that, in so far  as  that  test  is  concerned,  the
    appellant has shown he meets the requirements of regulation 8. However,
    his case falls squarely within the discretionary area afforded  to  the
    respondent to decide whether, in light of my  findings,  the  appellant
    should be issued a family permit with reference to regulation  12(2)(c)
    of the EEA Regulations 2006.

25.   The decision breaches the appellant's rights under the EU Treaties  in
    respect of entry to or residence in the United Kingdom.

Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr R. Ahmed, instructed by Marks & Marks Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr C. Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    The appellant appealed the respondent's decision dated  07  July  2016
    to refuse to issue a family permit as an extended family member  of  an
    EEA  national  with  reference  to  regulation  8  of  The  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 ("the EEA Regulations 2006").



2.    The respondent was not satisfied the appellant was related to the  EEA
    sponsor  as  claimed.  The  respondent  was  not  satisfied  there  was
    sufficient evidence to show that the appellant  was  wholly  or  mainly
    financially dependent upon the EEA sponsor.

3.    First-tier Tribunal Judge  E.B.  Grant  ("the  judge")  dismissed  the
    appeal in a decision promulgated  on  15  March  2019.  The  judge  was
    satisfied that the appellant produced sufficient evidence to show  that
    he was related to the EEA sponsor [8]. She was satisfied that there was
    evidence to show that the appellant's brother was an EEA  national  who
    was exercising his rights of free movement in the  UK  [9].  The  judge
    went on to consider the evidence relating to the  sponsor's  income  as
    well as evidence relating  to  money  transfers  to  the  appellant  in
    Pakistan [10-16]. The judge noted the declared income on the  sponsor's
    tax returns. For the year ending 05  April  2016  his  net  income  was
    �19,724 [11]. For the year ending 05 April  2017  his  net  income  was
    �16,684 [10]. The judge recorded a number of  money  transfer  receipts
    for the period 10 January 2014 to 08 January 2017, many of  which  were
    for sums in the region of �500-�1,000 [13]. The judge  raised  concerns
    about the sponsor's ability to afford the money transfers on his income
    given that his evidence was that the rent  on  the  property  where  he
    lived was �1,200 a month [15]. When the judge raised her concerns,  the
    sponsor clarified that he only pays �400 towards rent and  his  brother
    pays the rest [16]. Despite this clarification,  and  the  evidence  of
    money transfers, the judge was not satisfied that  the  sponsor  was  a
    credible witness as to how he could afford to send the sums claimed  to
    the appellant in Pakistan [20]. She concluded that  the  appellant  had
    failed to discharge the burden of proving that he  was  dependent  upon
    the sponsor.

4.    The  appellant  appealed  the  First-tier  Tribunal  decision  on  the
    following grounds:

    (i)    The judge's finding that the sponsor could not  afford  to  send
         remittances was irrational in light of the money transfer receipts,
         which showed, at least to the required standard, that  the  sponsor
         was able to afford to send monies to his brother.

    (ii)   The judge failed to take into account relevant evidence  showing
         the sponsor's income for the  year  ending  05  April  2018,  which
         indicated that he earned a net income of �20,606.

    (iii)  The judge failed to give adequate reasons to explain why she did
         not find the sponsor to be a  credible  witness  in  light  of  his
         explanation that he only paid �400 towards the rent for  the  house
         he lived in with his brother in the UK. It was not implausible that
         he could afford to send the monies he claimed.

Decision and reasons

5.    Having considered the grounds of appeal and the oral  submissions,  we
    conclude that the First-tier Tribunal decision involved the  making  of
    errors of law and must be set aside.

6.    We are satisfied that the judge's conclusions  were  not  sufficiently
    supported by reasons given that she appeared to accept that the sponsor
    earned a net income of �16,684 in the tax year up  to  05  April  2017,
    which would amount to an  average  monthly  income  of  around  �1,390.
    Having expressed her concern about the sponsor's ability to afford  the
    remittances she failed to make any finding as to whether  she  accepted
    the sponsor's evidence that he only contributed around �400 to the rent
    on the property, which he shared with his brother. While we accept that
    a judge need not  make  findings  on  each  and  every  aspect  of  the
    evidence, it was necessary to give sufficient reasons  to  justify  her
    finding that the sponsor could not afford to send  the  remittances.  A
    basic calculation indicates that the  sponsor  would  have  had  around
    �1,000 a month income after he contributed to the rent.

7.    The judge noted the large number of money  transfer  receipts  showing
    that the sponsor did appear to be able to afford to send the amounts he
    claimed. At [21] the judge found that there was  no  evidence  to  show
    that the sums were received by the appellant in Pakistan or  that  they
    were sent from the sponsor despite the fact that there were a number of
    money transfer receipts showing  transfers  from  the  sponsor  to  the
    appellant in Pakistan. The judge's reason for placing little weight  on
    this evidence seems to  have  been  rooted  in  her  doubts  about  the
    sponsor's ability to afford to transfer the funds.

8.    The judge also failed to consider more up  to  date  evidence  of  the
    sponsor's income relating to the tax  year  ending  05  April  2018.  A
    letter from the sponsor's accountant dated 21 December 2018 stated that
    his net income for the  year  was  �20,606  and  was  supported  by  an
    accountant's report. By the time the supplementary bundle was  prepared
    and served on 08 March 2019 it might have been reasonable to  expect  a
    copy of the sponsor's tax  return.  However,  the  figure  was  broadly
    consistent  with  the  sponsor's  income  in  a  previous   year.   The
    supplementary  bundle  contained  further  copies  of  money   transfer
    receipts for the period from April 2017 to January 2019,  which  showed
    average transfers of around �600-700.  The judge failed to consider the
    evidence contained in the supplementary  bundle,  which  was  at  least
    capable of showing that the sponsor earned  a  net  monthly  income  of
    around �1,717 a month and that he appeared to continue to  be  able  to
    afford to send  regular  remittances  from  that  income.  The  judge's
    failure to consider relevant evidence amounts to an error of law.

9.    Although the Upper Tribunal makes standard directions for the  parties
    to be ready to proceed to a remaking of the decision if the  First-tier
    Tribunal decision is set aside, no up to date evidence  was  served  in
    preparation for the hearing. A copy of the sponsor's recent tax  return
    would be of assistance. As would a schedule of his monthly  income  and
    expenditure to assess whether he can afford the  remittances.  We  also
    note that there is no statement from the appellant to  explain  how  he
    spends the claimed remittances and whether the money is used to support
    other family members in Pakistan. The parties agreed that it was in the
    interests of justice to adjourn for up to date evidence to be  produced
    so that the Upper Tribunal could remake the decision.

10.   The First-tier Tribunal finding relating to the  relationship  between
    the appellant and the EEA sponsor is  preserved.  The  appeal  will  be
    listed for a resumed hearing to determine the issue of dependency  with
    reference to regulation 8 of the EEA Regulations 2006.



DIRECTIONS

11.   Both parties are given permission to file up to date  evidence,  which
    must be served at least 14 days before the next hearing.



DECISION

The First-tier Tribunal decision involved the making of an error on a  point
of law

The decision is set aside

The appeal will be relisted for a resumed hearing in the Upper Tribunal
