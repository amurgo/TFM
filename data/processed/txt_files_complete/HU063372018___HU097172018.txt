Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Kotas, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
                    (written submissions)
For the Respondents:   Louis Kennedy, Solicitors (written submissions)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge Harrington) which allowed  the  respondents'
    appeals under Art 8 of the ECHR against decisions of the  Secretary  of
    State taken on 17 February  2018  refusing  each  of  the  respondents'
    indefinite leave to remain based upon long residence under para 276B of
    the Immigration Rules (HC 395 as amended).

 2. The basis of the Secretary of State's refusal was, in reliance on  para
    322(5) of the Immigration Rules, that the  first  respondent  had  been
    dishonest in declaring discrepant incomes in his HMRC tax  returns  for
    the tax years 2010/2011 and 2012/2013 and in earlier applications  made
    by him for Tier 1 leave on 29 March 2011 and 10 March  2013,  following
    which he was granted further leave to remain on  both  occasions.   The
    second respondent is the first respondent's wife.  Her claim under  the
    Immigration Rules was as his dependant.

The Appeal

 3. Following the decision of Judge Harrington, the Secretary of State  was
    granted permission to appeal by the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  J  M
    Holmes) on 18 April 2020.

 4. Thereafter, in the light of the COVID-19 crisis, directions were issued
    by the UT (UTJ L K Smith) on 15 May 2020 indicating a provisional  view
    that the error of law issue could be determined without a  hearing  and
    seeking further submissions from the parties in relation to  the  error
    of law issue and also as to whether  the  appeal  could  be  determined
    without a hearing.

 5. In response to those directions, the Secretary of State  filed  further
    submissions dated 11 June 2020 indicating that she agreed with the UT's
    provisional view that the case was suitable to be determined without  a
    hearing.  The respondents filed further submissions on 15 June 2020 (as
    a rule 24 response)  seeking  to  maintain  the  judge's  decision  but
    indicating that they requested an oral hearing.

 6. The Secretary of State filed submissions by way of reply  on  5  August
    2020 in support of her appeal that  the  judge  had  erred  in  law  in
    allowing the appeal under Art 8.

 7. In the light of the party's  submissions,  and  having  regard  to  the
    interests of justice and the overriding objective  of  determining  the
    appeal justly and fairly, despite the invitation by the respondents for
    there to be an oral hearing, I am satisfied that it  would  be  in  the
    interests of justice to determine this appeal without a  hearing  under
    rule 34 of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  (SI
    2008/2698 as amended) and para 4 of the Amended General Pilot  Practice
    Directions: Contingency Arrangements in the First-tier Tribunal and the
    Upper Tribunal (14  September  2020)  issued  by  (then)  Vice   Senior
    President and (now) Senior President of Tribunals,  the  Rt.  Hon.  Sir
    Keith Lindblom.

 8. One further procedural matter  concerns  an  application  made  by  the
    respondent's solicitors for anonymity on  the  basis  that  the  appeal
    involves  documentary  evidence  containing   information   about   the
    respondents' daughter and son and also the  financial  details  of  the
    first respondent.  In my judgment, this is not an appropriate  case  to
    be anonymised on the basis put forward by the respondents.  Neither the
    fact that the appeals concern the  financial  situation  of  the  first
    respondent, nor that the circumstances of the respondent's children is,
    or would be if the appeal decision  to  be  remade,  require  that  the
    appeals be anonymised.  No  significant  details  of  the  respondent's
    children are, in any event, disclosed in this determination.

Background

 9. The first respondent was born  on  5  September  1984  and  the  second
    respondent was born on 28 August 1984.  They are both citizens of India
    and are married.

10. The first respondent entered the UK in September 2006 with valid  leave
    as a student.  He remained in the UK until May 2009 when he returned to
    India before re-entering the UK on 25 June 2009 with entry clearance as
    a Tier 1 (Post-Study) Migrant.  He remained as a Tier  1  Migrant  with
    leave valid until 2 June 2016.

11. The second respondent entered the UK  on  5  January  2011  with  valid
    leave.

12. On 24 May 2016, the first  respondent  applied  for  further  leave  to
    remain as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant with the second respondent as  his
    dependant.  On 31 March 2017, the respondents varied their  application
    for leave to one based upon long  residence  under  para  276B  of  the
    Immigration Rules (HC 395 as amended) and seeking indefinite  leave  to
    remain.

13. On 12 December 2017, the Secretary of State requested  that  the  first
    respondent complete a tax questionnaire and  provide  various  historic
    financial documents.  The first respondent replied  under  cover  of  a
    letter dated 7 January 2018.  In his response he declared that some  of
    his previous tax returns contained errors  which  he  had  subsequently
    discovered and corrected.

14. In his Tier 1 application dated 29 March 2011, the first respondent had
    claimed total earnings of �49,684.96 consisting of employment income of
    �21,999.96 and self-employed income (as a director of a UK company)  of
    �36,560.

15. For the tax year 2010/2011, the first respondent did  not  declare  his
    employment income to HMRC.  Also, for that tax year 2010/11  the  first
    respondent declared self-employed income of only �2,685.

16. In his Tier 1 application dated  10  May  2013,  the  first  respondent
    claimed total earnings of  �42,500.77  consisting  of  from  employment
    income of �35,298.77 and self-employed income (as a director  of  a  UK
    company) of �7,202.

17. For the tax year 2012/2013, the first respondent declared to HMRC total
    earnings of �34,187 including self-employed income of �1,166.

18. It was the first respondent's case that it was only after HMRC  carried
    out routine  checks  on  3  April  2013  that  the  discrepancies  were
    discovered.  On 26 May 2016 the first respondent submitted amended  tax
    returns for the relevant tax years 2010/2011, 2011/2012 and 2012/2013.

19. On 12 February 2018, the Secretary of State  refused  the  respondents'
    applications for ILR on the basis of para 322(5) of the Rules  and  the
    differential in income submitted as part of the first respondent's  tax
    returns for the tax years 2010/2011 and 2012/2013 by contrast to income
    claimed in his Tier 1 applications.

The Judge's Decision

20. At the hearing before Judge Harrington, the first respondent gave  oral
    evidence.  He also submitted a detailed written witness statement.  The
    contents of this evidence is summarised by the judge at paras 19 and 24
    of her determination as follows.

21. First, as regards the first respondent's witness statement,  the  judge
    (at para 19) summarised it as follows.  I  have  omitted  evidence  not
    relevant to his financial circumstances:

         "a.  he accepts that there are discrepancies in the income declared
             to HMRC and that declared to the Home Office;

         b.   the 12 month periods that he claimed income for in his Tier  1
             applications did not match the tax years exactly;

         c.   he filed amendments to the figures declared to  HMRC  for  the
             2011, 2012 and 2013 financial years on 26 May 2016.  This  was
             before his application for ILR on the basis of long residence;



         d.   as advised by his accountant, he split the income of  �36,560,
             as  declared  on  his  First-tier  1  application,  into   the
             2011/2012 tax years which is why his amendment  for  2011  was
             only to �19,855;

         e.   he also declared �7,202 for self-employment in  the  amendment
             for y-e 2013;

         f.   he would have scored 20 points for income on the basis of  his
             employment income from  May  2012  to  April  2013  which  was
             accepted at �35,298.77.  He would have been awarded 35  points
             for a Masters, 5 points for UK experience and  20  points  for
             being under 30 so he would  have  obtained  the  necessary  80
             points;

         g.   the Home Office should  have  considered  his  good  character
             generally  and  his  integration  in  considering  whether  to
             exercise discretion to refuse;

         ..."

22. Secondly, as regards the first respondent's oral evidence,  in  respect
    of  which  he  was  cross-examined  by   the   Secretary   of   State's
    representative, the judge set out his evidence at para 24  as  follows.
    Again,  I  have  omitted  evidence  not  relevant  to   his   financial
    circumstances:

         "a.  he has an academic qualification  in  computer  science  which
             does not include book keeping/accountancy;

         b.   for his accounts, he  gave  the  accountant:  dividends,  bank
             statements, invoices and all other related documents; he  gave
             everything he had;

         c.   he did not receive any letter querying his earnings during his
             Tier 1 applications;

         d.   (when asked what he thought cause the error)  it  could  be  a
             number of things.  A trainee accountant was due to handle  the
             case.  He was not asked to come back and sign documents.  They
             told him to just wait for the tax bill and then pay it;

         e.   (when asked whether he thought the bill he received was wrong)
             his whole focus was to pay it on time.  Looking at things  now
             he should have checked the figures but he was very  busy  with
             work and his personal life;

         f.   in 2011 his wife came to the UK and  his  whole  mind  was  to
             settle her in the UK.  His wife got a job in Leeds and he  was
             travelling every weekend, juggling work and his personal life;



         g.   in 2013 his wife was pregnant, she had a  few  medical  issues
             and his focus was on helping her out which was very stressful;



         h.   he never intentionally misled anyone.  He was very  upset  and
             distressed by all this.  This is the 4th time he has  come  to
             court.  All his income is genuine.  He is a bit upset with his
             old accountant;

         i.   he is now up-to-date with his HMRC payments;

         ....

         k.   (when it was put  to  him  that  he  would  have  noticed  the
             significant discrepancies) he is not very  good  with  figures
             and with accounting.  He put all his faith in  a  professional
             accountant;

         l.   in 2013 he was eligible for Tier 1 without putting  his  self-
             employed forward, he  was  eligible  on  just  the  Nationwide
             earnings;

         m.   (when asked about his new accountant) he doesn't know  whether
             his accountant has experience in immigration cases but he is a
             proper  accountant.   His  accountant  prepared  the   amended
             documents and submitted them to HMRC.  The accountant said the
             company year doesn't end in March.  He did what they advised:

         n.   he accepted the self-employment  earnings  declared  in  April
             2013 were significantly different to what he earned;

         o.   (when it was put to him that he  was  dishonest  in  order  to
             order to obtain a Tier 1 visa) he  never  misled  anyone.   He
             always conducted himself honestly.  When he  realised  he  had
             made sure it was all sorted;

              ...

         v.   before  he  applied,  he  collected  all  the  documents.   He
             couldn't contact his old accountant -  he  tried  calling  and
             visited the office which was closed - so he went  to  his  new
             accountants.  His new accountants got the documents from  HMRC
             and they realised the problem;

         w.   he changed accountants in 2014.  He changed his job completely
             and opened a limited company.  His friends said go  with  this
             accountant that he was also working with so he went with  that
             accountant;

         x.   he was discussing his old  returns  with  his  new  accountant
             because with the application he had to  submit  all  documents
             for five years;

         y.   he is not sure whether his tax returns were  submitted  online
             or in paper form;

         z.   he is not sure whether his accountants asked  him  to  sign  a
             blank return;

         aa.  the figures for his Tier 1 applications were prepared  by  his
             accountant.  As  far  as  he  is  aware  the  Respondent  only
             accepted information from accountants;

         bb.  when he made his earlier Tier 1 applications he submitted bank
             statements to the Home Office."

23. Having set out the submissions  of  the  Secretary  of  State  and  the
    respondents respectively in paras 25 and 26 of her  determination,  the
    judge went on to make a number of factual findings at paras 27-41.

24. At para 27, the judge stated that she  had  considered  both  the  oral
    evidence of the first  respondent  and  the  entirety  of  the  written
    evidence submitted.

25. At para 28 the judge noted that:

         "Neither party chose  to  explore  the  mathematics  of  the  First
         Appellant's various tax returns or immigration applications in  any
         detail and the  original  applications  were  not  before  me.   In
         particular, whilst the dates of the immigration  applications  have
         been provided it  is  not  clear  what  time  periods  the  account
         submitted covered, the requirement being for a 12 month  period  in
         the 15 months prior to the application."

26. At para 29 the judge directed herself that she considered the "totality
    of the evidence"  in  determining  whether  the  first  Respondent  was
    dishonest.

27. At paras 30-40, the judge gave her detailed reasons for concluding that
    the Secretary of State had not established that  the  first  respondent
    was dishonest.  It is helpful to set these reasons out in full:

         "30. I find that the information provided by the First Appellant to
             the Respondent in his immigration application was accurate and
             the information provided to HMRC was  inaccurate.   I  reached
             this conclusion because the Respondent states that the  source
             documentation (wage slips, bank statements, accounts/invoices,
             accountant's letter and income summary) was provided with  the
             applications and I conclude that  even  the  most  cursory  of
             glances would have noticed if the non-employment income  shown
             in the source documentation was significantly lower than  that
             claimed.

         31.  I turn to consider whether the Respondent has proved that  the
             inaccurate  information  provided   to   HMRC   was   provided
             deliberately and dishonestly by the First Appellant.

         32.  Clearly accountants, in common with all  other  professionals,
             are capable of  making  mistakes  and  so  it  is  not  wholly
             implausible that this occurred.

         33.  The Respondent suggests that the First Appellant  should  have
             known that the figures were incorrect.  I do not  accept  this
             argument because:

             (a)  the differing time periods as between the immigration and
                  tax  accounts  means  that  cross-referencing,   even   if
                  undertaken, is not straightforward;

             (b)  the tax system  is  not  straightforward.   For  example,
                  there are a number  of  allowances  which  are  permitted,
                  differing rates on different types of income and  expenses
                  which are allowed for  company/sole  trader  accounts  but
                  which are not liable for tax purposes.  Consequently, I do
                  not accept that  an  individual  without  tax  accountancy
                  training (i.e. an individual  like  the  First  Appellant)
                  would be able to easily tell that the tax bill did or  did
                  not coincide with their income;

             (c)  the First Appellant does not claim that  he  checked  his
                  tax returns or that he was provided with a tax calculation
                  (i.e.  one  showing  the  working).   Whilst  he   remains
                  personally liable for the errors even if he did not  check
                  the returns, and consequently should have checked them,  I
                  take judicial notice that people do not always  act  in  a
                  prudent manner and  so  I  cannot  infer  that  the  First
                  Appellant did check the documentation.

             As a result, I do not find from the mere fact that there  were
             differences that the First  Appellant  must  have  known  and,
             therefore, must have been dishonest.

         34.  I have borne in mind that there is no direct evidence from the
             First Appellant's accountants  (old  or  new)  before  me  and
             consequently  that  I  am  entirely  reliant  on   the   First
             Appellant's  oral  evidence  and  the  documentary   evidence.
             Whilst there is no requirement for corroborative evidence is a
             factor which may affect my conclusions on credibility.

         35.  There are also other factors  which  I  have  considered  when
             deciding whether the First Appellant was dishonest.

         36.  I consider the  failure  to  conclude  the  First  Appellant's
             employment income to be a clear indication that the accountant
             has made an error.  The  whole  point  of  PAYE  is  that  the
             information is automatically notified to HMRC  and  so  no-one
             could sensibly have expected to 'get away' with not  declaring
             PAYE income.  As a result, I  conclude  that  the  failure  to
             declare the First Appellant's PAYE income was an error, and  a
             significant one, by the  Appellant's  then  accountant.   This
             suggests a lack of competence.

         37.  The amendments made by the First Appellant's tax  returns  are
             also relevant.  If the amendments had been motivated purely by
             tidying-up his returns for immigration purposes, I would  have
             expected the figures to be identical to those declared in  his
             immigration applications.  This is not the case.  As he states
             he was advised by his new accountants, the  income  which  was
             within  a  single  year  for  immigration  purposes  has  been
             allocated to two tax years.  This is strong evidence of a wish
             to ensure that the information given to HMRC is  correct,  not
             merely convenient.

         38.  I have also borne in mind that the First  Appellant  has  made
             prompt applications to  maintain  lawful  immigration  status,
             including returning  to  India  to  make  an  entry  clearance
             application when required and this shows a respect for UK law.



         39.  The First Appellant has given a credible explanation  for  why
             and how the mistakes in his tax returns came to his attention.
              Moreover, the explanation only came to light in  response  to
             questions I posed.  I consider this  is  an  important  factor
             because it suggests that he has not fabricated and planned  to
             give his explanation in advance as if that was  his  intention
             he would have ensured that this evidence was given, not simply
             relied upon the chance that I would ask a  relevant  question.
             As a result, I cannot infer from the fact  that  he  corrected
             his tax returns, that he knew, at  the  point  of  submission,
             that they were incorrect.

         40.  Having  considered  the  totality  of  the  evidence  and  the
             parties' submissions, I conclude that the Respondent  has  not
             proved that the First Appellant was  dishonest.   While  there
             are undoubtedly inaccuracies in the tax returns and an absence
             of corroborative evidence from the  accountants,  I  find  the
             First Appellant's explanation to be coherent and I  find  that
             the surrounding circumstances  are  all  consistent  with  the
             errors  not  being  as  a  result  of  the  First  Appellant's
             dishonesty but merely the result of errors.

         41.  Consequently, the refusal under 322(5) is not appropriate and,
             as the Respondent  accepts,  the  First  Appellant  meets  the
             requirements of the  Rules  for  ILR  on  the  basis  of  long
             residence."

28. The judge then went on in para 41 to find that, the Respondents  having
    established that they met the requirements for  ILR,  the  interference
    with their private life was not proportionate and was a breach  of  Art
    8.

The Secretary of State's Challenge

29. Reading the Secretary of State's grounds of appeal  together  with  her
    further submissions, a number of points are made.

30. First, it is submitted that the judge failed to apply the approach  set
    out in the case  of  R  (Khan)  v  SSHD  [2018]  UKUT  384  (IAC).   In
    particular, the judge  was  wrong  to  accept  the  first  respondent's
    evidence that the discrepancy arose as a result of  the  error  by  his
    accountant  without  any  evidence  supporting  that  either  from  his
    original accountant or his more recent accountant.   Reliance  is  also
    placed upon Balajigari and others v SSHD [2019] EWCA Civ 673  at  [106]
    where it is said that in an earnings  discrepancy  case,  such  as  the
    present, it is unlikely that a tribunal will accept  a  mere  assertion
    from an individual  that  their  accountant  was  responsible  for  the
    discrepancy without a full and particularised explanation of  what  the
    mistake was and how it arose.

31. Secondly, the Secretary of State contends that the judge failed to give
    adequate reasons for a finding that the first respondent was  a  victim
    of careless accounting and not guilty of dishonestly misleading  either
    the Home Office or HMRC as to his income.

32. Thirdly,  in  the  Secretary  of  State's  reply  to  the  respondents'
    submissions, it is contended that the judge  failed  to  give  adequate
    reasons for concluding that the information supplied to  the  Secretary
    of State was correct and that the figures submitted  to  the  HMRC  (at
    least originally) were inaccurate.  The judge's reasoning  is  premised
    solely on the fact that the documentation  sent  to  the  Secretary  of
    State with the applications was reliable rather than, as the  Secretary
    of State contended in the alternative, the first respondent  had  never
    in fact earned that money and so his self-employment was fictitious.

Discussion

33. The Secretary of State's case relies principally on the decision of the
    Upper Tribunal in Khan where Martin Spencer J gave guidance as  to  the
    proper approach in income discrepancy cases where it is alleged that an
    individual is dishonest, either in his declaration  of  income  to  the
    HMRC or in his claimed income made in an application for leave  to  the
    Secretary of State.  The guidance is set out in paras  (i)-(v)  of  the
    judicial headnote as follows:

         "(i) Where there has been  a  significant  difference  between  the
             income claimed in a previous application for leave  to  remain
             and the income declared to HMRC, the  Secretary  of  State  is
             entitled to draw an inference  that  the  Applicant  has  been
             deceitful or dishonest and therefore he should be refused  ILR
             within paragraph 322(5) of the  Immigration  Rules.   Such  an
             inference could  be  expected  where  there  is  no  plausible
             explanation for the discrepancy.

          (ii)    Where an Applicant has presented evidence  to  show  that,
             despite  the  prima  facie  inference,  he  was  not  in  fact
             dishonest but only careless, then the Secretary of State  must
             decide whether the explanation and evidence is sufficient,  in
             her  view,  to  displace  the   prima   facie   inference   of
             deceit/dishonesty.

          (iii)   In approaching that fact-finding task,  the  Secretary  of
             State should remind herself that,  although  the  standard  of
             proof is the "balance of probability", a finding that a person
             has been deceitful  and  dishonest  in  relation  to  his  tax
             affairs with the consequence that he is denied  settlement  in
             this  country  is  a  very  serious   finding   with   serious
             consequences.

          (iv)    For an Applicant simply to blame his or her accountant for
             an "error" in relation to the historical tax return  will  not
             be the end of the matter, given that the  accountant  will  or
             should have asked the tax payer to confirm that the return was
             accurate and to have signed the tax  return.  Furthermore  the
             Applicant will have known of his or her earnings and will have
             expected to pay tax thereon.  If the Applicant does  not  take
             steps within a reasonable time to remedy  the  situation,  the
             Secretary of State may  be  entitled  to  conclude  that  this
             failure justifies a conclusion that there has been  deceit  or
             dishonesty.

          (v) When considering whether or not the Applicant is dishonest  or
             merely careless the Secretary of  State  should  consider  the
             following matters, inter alia, as well as the extent to  which
             they are evidenced (as opposed to asserted):

             i.   Whether the explanation for the error by  the  accountant
                  is plausible;

             ii.  Whether the documentation which can be assumed  to  exist
                  (for example, correspondence between the Applicant and his
                  accountant at  the  time  of  the  tax  return)  has  been
                  disclosed or there is a plausible explanation for  why  it
                  is missing;

             iii. Why the Applicant did not realise that an error had  been
                  made because his liability to pay tax  was  less  than  he
                  should have expected;

             iv.  Whether, at any stage, the Applicant has taken  steps  to
                  remedy the situation and, if so,  when  those  steps  were
                  taken and the explanation for any significant delay."

34. In Balajigari, that approach was  largely  approved  by  the  Court  of
    Appeal apart from the caution expressed at  [42]  in  relation  to  the
    "starting point" set out in paras (i) and (ii) of the headnote in Khan.
     In Balajigari, Underhill LJ (with  whom  Hickinbottom  and  Singh  LJJ
    agreed) said this ([42]):

         "42. Although Martin Spencer J clearly makes  the  point  that  the
         Secretary of State must carefully consider any case  advanced  that
         the  discrepancy  is  the  result  of  carelessness   rather   than
         dishonesty, there is in our view a danger that his "starting-point"
         mis-states the position A discrepancy between the earnings declared
         to HMRC and to the Home Office  may  justifiably  give  rise  to  a
         suspicion that it is the result of dishonesty but it  does  not  by
         itself justify a conclusion to that effect.  What  it  does  is  to
         call for an explanation.  If  an  explanation  one  sought  is  not
         forthcoming, or is unconvincing, it may at that point be legitimate
         for the Secretary of State to infer dishonesty; but  even  in  that
         case the position is not that  there  is  a  legal  burden  on  the
         applicant to disprove dishonesty.   The  Secretary  of  State  must
         simply decide, considering the discrepancy  in  the  light  of  the
         explanation (or lack of it),  whether  he  is  satisfied  that  the
         applicant has been dishonest."

35. At [43], the Court approved Martin Spencer J's  view  at  [30(iii)]  in
    Khan that the standard of proof was a "balance  of  probabilities"  but
    that a finding  of  dishonesty  was  a  serious  finding  with  serious
    consequences.  Underhill LJ said this:

         "... despite the valiant attempts made by Ms Anderson on behalf  of
         the Secretary of State before us to argue the contrary, we consider
         (as Martin Spencer J did) that the concept of standard of proof  is
         not inappropriate in the present context. This is because  what  is
         being asserted by the Secretary of State is that an  applicant  for
         ILR has been dishonest. That is a serious allegation, carrying with
         it serious consequences. Accordingly, we agree with Martin  Spencer
         J that the Secretary of State must be satisfied that dishonesty has
         occurred, the standard of proof being the balance of  probabilities
         but bearing in mind the serious nature of the  allegation  and  the
         serious  consequences  which  follow  from  such   a   finding   of
         dishonesty."

36. The guidance in  Khan,  as  approved  in  Balajigari,  was  principally
    directed to the Secretary of State reaching a decision on a  particular
    immigration application and  the  guidance  arose  in  the  context  of
    judicial review of an adverse decision.  It is, nevertheless, generally
    applicable to a decision-maker when considering an  income  discrepancy
    case, including a judge hearing an appeal in the First-tier Tribunal.

37. Of course, in an appeal a judge is likely  to  have  the  advantage  of
    hearing an appellant give evidence and be cross-examined.   In  a  case
    where there is no appeal, but there is a challenge by way  of  judicial
    review to the Secretary of State's decision, there will, at best,  have
    been an  interview  which  the  individual  will  have  been  given  an
    opportunity to deal with any allegation of dishonesty.   Indeed,  as  a
    requirement of fairness that was one of the issues decided by the Court
    of Appeal in Balajigari.  That is  likely  to  be  a  less  informative
    exercise than if the individual gives evidence and is cross-examined by
    a representative of the Secretary of State and a judge is then required
    to make an assessment of that individual's credibility.

38. The decision in Khan  (as  approved  in  Balajigari)  did  not,  in  my
    judgment, set out a straightjacket as to the approach  that  should  be
    followed by a decision maker in  reaching  a  decision  on  whether  an
    individual has acted dishonestly.   The  decision  provides  a  helpful
    guide, and no more than  that,  as  to  how  a  decision  maker  should
    approach that task.  The Court of Appeal in Balajigari noted (at  [40])
    the points made in Khan were "by way of general guidance".   The  Court
    clearly took the view that each  case  must  turn  upon  an  individual
    factual assessment.

39. Nevertheless, the case law beginning in Khan and concluding  in  Abbasi
    (rule 43; para 322(5): accountants' evidence) Pakistan [2020]  UKUT  27
    (IAC) and Ashfaq (Balajigari: appeals)  [2020]  UKUT  226  (IAC),  does
    emphasise that an individual's claim that any error was that  of  their
    accountant, and not dishonestly made by them, is likely to need  to  be
    supported by evidence from that accountant  (see  Khan  at  [37(vii)]).
    So, in Abbasi the UT stated, as set out in the judicial headnote, that:



         "...  where  an  individual  relies  upon  an  accountant's  letter
         admitting fault in the submission of incorrect tax returns  to  Her
         Majesty's Revenue and Customs, the First-tier or Upper Tribunal  is
         unlikely to place  any  material  weight  on  that  letter  if  the
         accountant does  not  attend  the  hearing  to  give  evidence,  by
         reference to a Statement of Truth,  that  explains  in  detail  the
         circumstances in which the error came to be  made;  the  basis  and
         nature of any compensations; and whether the firm's insurers and/or
         any  relevant  regulatory  body  has  been   informed.    This   is
         particularly so where the letter is clearly perfunctory in nature."



40. Likewise, in Ashfaq, as set out in the judicial headnote, the UT stated
    that:

         "The explanation by any accountant said to have made or contributed
         to an error is essential because the allegation of  error  goes  to
         the accountant's professional standing.  Without evidence from  the
         accountant, the Tribunal may consider that the facts  laid  by  the
         Secretary of State establish the appellant's dishonesty."

41. The forensic importance of evidence from the accountant  who  submitted
    the tax return, and indeed oral evidence or  evidence  supported  by  a
    statement  of  truth  from  him,  is  emphasised  in  these  decisions.
    However, the decisions are necessarily  made  in  the  context  of  the
    "general  guidance"  given  in  Khan  and  approved  in  substance   in
    Balajigari.  I do not understand  the  UT  in  any  of  the  subsequent
    decisions to have laid down as a legal requirement  that  in  order  to
    succeed an appellant must produce supporting evidence from the relevant
    accountant.  In  Khan,  Martin  Spencer  J  acknowledged  that  it  was
    relevant to take into account "a plausible explanation" why  supporting
    evidence  from  an  accountant  was  missing  (see  [37(vi)ii)]).    In
    Balajigari, the Court of Appeal (at [106]) went no further than stating
    that it was "unlikely" that a tribunal would be prepared  to  accept  a
    mere assertion from an applicant.  The Court of Appeal went on to  note
    that a mere assertion  simply  of  'a  mistake'  "without  a  full  and
    particularised explanation of what that mistake was and how  it  arose"
    might be important.

42. Production of supporting evidence from the accountant may  be  expected
    but it cannot, in my judgment, be a mandatory requirement without which
    an appellant would not be  able  to  shift  the  evidential  burden  by
    establishing an innocent explanation so that the respondent  will  have
    discharged the legal burden of establishing dishonesty on the  part  of
    the individual.  It cannot be,  in  my  judgment,  that  an  individual
    cannot be believed that a mistake was that of  his  accountant  in  the
    absence of evidence from that accountant.  There may be cases where  it
    is simply impossible, or not reasonably practicable, to obtain evidence
    from the initial accountant.  The accountant  may  be  untraceable  (as
    appears to have  been  the  case  in  this  appeal)  or  no  longer  be
    practising or willing to assist the appellant in presenting their case.



43. An individual's case may  not  be  as  strong  without  the  supporting
    evidence from an accountant, but, applying a  fact-sensitive  approach,
    an individual's case cannot always be impossible of proof without  such
    evidence.  Each case will depend upon an  assessment  of  the  evidence
    available, including the underlying creditworthiness (or  not)  of  the
    individual and what, if  any,  other  documentary  evidence  exists  to
    support the individual's case. It  will,  of  course,  be  relevant  to
    consider why such evidence is not forthcoming and, in my judgment,  the
    case law does not impose  any  rigid  requirement  that  such  evidence
    should always be produced.

44. I do not accept the submission that the judge failed to  give  adequate
    reasons for her conclusion that the that the  declared  income  in  the
    first respondent's leave applications was correct.   At  para  30,  the
    judge gave sustainable reasons  why  she  accepted  that  the  evidence
    established that the declaration of income to the  Secretary  of  State
    was accurate and that that disclosed to HMRC in his initial tax returns
    for 2010/11 and 2012/13 was mistaken.  It may well have  been  part  of
    the respondents' case that one or other of the declarations (whether to
    HMRC or the Secretary of State) was wrong but not necessarily that  the
    income declared to the Secretary of State was correct.  That  point  is
    made in the Secretary of State's written reply  to  submissions.   But,
    the submissions summarised at para 25 of the judge's determination made
    on behalf of the respondent do not spell that out.  In  any  event,  it
    was open to the judge  to  find,  on  the  basis  that  the  supporting
    documents submitted with the first respondent's applications for  leave
    included documents from his bank and wage  slips  and  an  accountant's
    letter, had not been shown to lack authenticity or not be genuine.

45. In my judgment, the judge gave detailed and sustainable reasons for her
    findings.  At para 33 onwards, the judge gave her reasons  for  finding
    (at  para  40)  that  the  first  respondent  had  shown  an  'innocent
    explanation', namely that he had inadvertently (perhaps carelessly  but
    not dishonestly)  submitted  inaccurate  tax  returns  in  2010/11  and
    2012/13  and,  as  a  consequence,  the  Secretary  of  State  had  not
    established that he  was  dishonest.   I  have  set  out  the  relevant
    paragraphs (31-40) of her determination above.

46. The judge recognised at para 34 that there  was  no  "direct  evidence"
    from the first respondent's old or  new  accountants.   She  recognised
    that his claim rested entirely upon her assessment of his oral evidence
    and the documentary evidence.  She was clearly alive to the  issue  and
    the import of the guidance in Khan on this issue (see also para 40).

47.  The  judge  made  the  point  that  the  "mathematics"  of  the  first
    respondent's various tax returns and immigration applications were  not
    part of either parties' case before her.  It was an entirely reasonable
    and relevant factor to take into account the fact that the omission  of
    the first respondent's PAYE in his tax return was  an  error  which  an
    individual could not expect to "get away with"  since  PAYE  income  is
    automatically notified to the HMRC.  The judge  was  entitled  to  take
    that into account as being more consistent with a mistake  (probably  a
    careless one) by the  first  respondent's  accountants  rather  than  a
    deliberate, dishonest failure by the first respondent to  include  that
    income in his tax return.  Likewise, as regards the first  respondent's
    self-employed  income,  even  in  the   absence   of   a   mathematical
    calculation, the judge was entitled to accept  the  first  respondent's
    evidence that the self-employed income for each  of  the  relevant  tax
    years did not precisely correspond to the self-employed income for  the
    accounting periods covered by his accounts submitted to  the  Secretary
    of State in his applications for leave.  The first respondent had given
    clear evidence that the self-employed  income  had  to  be  apportioned
    between the relevant years  and  that  was  why  the  figures  did  not
    precisely match up.  The judge was entitled  to  accept  this  evidence
    which was certainly supportive of the first respondent seeking  to  act
    honestly vis-�-vis the HMRC and not seeking to align  his  tax  returns
    with the documents submitted to  the  Secretary  of  State  as  "merely
    convenient". The judge was also impressed by the fact  that  the  first
    respondent gave his explanation, not in advance of the hearing and  not
    in his evidence-in-chief, but rather in answer to a question from  her.
    That was, a matter which she was  entitled  to  take  into  account  in
    determining whether or not she believed his evidence and whether it was
    fabricated and planned rather than honestly given.

48. The judge had the benefit of hearing the  first  respondent  give  oral
    evidence which was subject to cross-examination  by  the  Secretary  of
    State's representative.  The judge was required to assess  whether  she
    found  the  first  respondent's  evidence,  and  the  first  respondent
    himself, to be credible.  She bore in mind the guidance, albeit without
    specific reference to the case itself, in Khan,  in  particular  noting
    the  absence  of  supporting  letters  from  the   first   respondent's
    accountants.  She gave detailed, careful  and  reasonable  reasons  for
    accepting the first  respondent  to  be  a  credible  witness  and  for
    accepting his account that the discrepancy arose from a mistake made by
    his accountants and not through his  own  dishonesty.   The  judge  was
    clearly alive to the issue, referred to in Khan, that an individual  is
    responsible for his own tax returns.  That is, of course, self-evident.
     However, the fact that an individual is responsible  for  his  return,
    which he should have signed, does not mean that he or  she  necessarily
    read and appreciated that the contents of his  return  were  inaccurate
    and that, therefore, an inference can be drawn that the tax return  has
    been made dishonestly.  Signing a document is not the same as reading a
    document  and  appreciating  its  contents  are   inaccurate.    Formal
    responsibility for the tax return is not the same as  saying  that  the
    taxpayer was dishonest when submitting it.

49. An appellate court or tribunal should be cautious in interfering with a
    trial court or First-tier Tribunal's findings  of  fact  reached  after
    hearing oral evidence from witnesses.  The assessment of that  evidence
    is quintessentially primarily a matter for  a  trial  judge.   Provided
    there is no misdirection in law (and there are none in these  appeals),
    all relevant matters are taken into account, and  cogent  and  adequate
    reasons given for a rational or reasonably reached conclusion, then the
    appellate court or tribunal must respect the fact-finding of the  judge
    even if the appellate court or  Tribunal  would  not  necessarily  have
    reached the same conclusion on the evidence.

50. In my judgment, the  judge  was  entitled  to  accept  that  the  first
    respondent had  an  'innocent  explanation'  even  in  the  absence  of
    supporting documentation from his accountant.  Having directed  herself
    correctly that the Secretary of State had to establish on a balance  of
    probabilities that  the  first  respondent  was  dishonest,  the  judge
    considered all the evidence and gave cogent and adequate reasons for  a
    rational and reasonable conclusion that  the  Secretary  of  State  had
    failed to discharge that legal burden.

51. Consequently, the judge did not err in law in reaching her finding that
    it had not been established that the first respondent was dishonest and
    so para 322(5) of the Immigration Rules did  not  apply.   It  was  not
    suggested before the judge, nor in the grounds of  appeal,  that  given
    that finding the first respondent did not meet the requirements of  the
    long  residence  rule  in  para  276B  and,  given  that  he  met   the
    requirements of that rule, both his  (and  his  wife's)  removal  would
    breach Art 8 of the ECHR.

Decision

52. The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  allow  the  respondents'
    appeals under Art 8 of the ECHR did not involve the making of an  error
    of law.  Those decisions, therefore stand.

53. Accordingly, the Secretary of State's appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  is
    dismissed.

                                                 Judge of the Upper Tribunal
                                                           25 September 2020



TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

Judge Harrington made no fee award  on  the  basis  that  her  decision  was
materially influenced by information not before the initial  decision-maker.
 No submissions were made that the fee award should be other  than  made  by
the judge.  Having dismissed the Secretary  of  State's  appeal  and  upheld
Judge Harrington's decision, I affirm her decision  that  no  fee  award  is
made.

                                                                      Signed

                                                                Andrew Grubb

                                                 Judge of the Upper Tribunal
                                                          25, September 2020
