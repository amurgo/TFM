For the Appellants:    No appearance
For the Respondent:    Mr N Smart (HOPO)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Bircher, promulgated on 25th February 2014, following  a  hearing
    on 11th February 2014.  In the determination, the judge  dismissed  the
    appeals of Mr  Ajaykumar  Shah  and  Mrs  Urvi  Shah.   The  Appellants
    subsequently applied for, and were granted, permission to appeal to the
    Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.

The Appellants

 2. The Appellants are husband and wife.  They are citizens of India.  They
    were born on 8th August 1971 and  3rd  July  1967  respectively.   They
    applied for entry clearance to visit their brother  and  brother-in-law
    respectively, but on 5th July 2013, their application was dismissed  by
    the Entry Clearance Officer on applying paragraph 41 of HC 395.

The Appellants' Claim

 3. The Appellants' claim is that the husband is a self-employed trader and
    earns approximately ï¿½444  per  month  and  that  the  couple  have  two
    children, and that they are likely to return back to India at  the  end
    of their visit.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge was satisfied that the Appellants had strong ties  to  India.
    They had submitted  affidavits  from  the  Appellants.   There  was  an
    affidavit from their son.  However, the ECO  had  raised  a  legitimate
    enquiry in relation to their financial circumstances, and yet failed to
    address this  in  the  Grounds  of  Appeal,  such  that  there  was  no
    explanation as to how Mr Shah, the principal Appellant, was involved in
    his business, and who would be managing the  business  during  the  two
    months that he intended to be in the UK.

 5. The appeal was dismissed.

Grounds of Application

 6. The grounds of application state that the couple have two daughters who
    are studying in India and that they would remain behind and  be  looked
    after by their aunt who will take them into their home.

 7. On 6th May 2014, permission to appeal was granted on the basis that  in
    his Notice of Appeal the husband had  stated  that  he  was  running  a
    partnership business in India  which  would  imply  that  there  was  a
    partner to conduct the business in his absence, and  the  determination
    did not engage with this explanation, or  indeed  did  the  documentary
    evidence.

Submissions

 8. At the hearing before me, there was no-one in attendance on  behalf  of
    the Appellants, and nor  was  there  any  explanation.   There  was  in
    attendance a representative for the Respondent Entry Clearance Officer,
    namely, Mr N Smart, a Senior Home Office  Presenting  Officer,  and  he
    submitted that he would rely upon his Rule 24 response of 22 May  2014.
    This explains that the Appellants were interviewed in Bombay.   It  was
    clear from this that the grounds of  application  had  no  merit.   The
    Appellant was asked what his occupation was and he said that he  ran  a
    business but he provided no evidence of his partner  and  therefore  it
    could not be said that the partner would manage  the  business  in  his
    absence.  No evidence of the partner was  presented  before  the  judge
    either.  Therefore there could not be an error of law.

No Error of Law

 9. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error (see Section 12(1) of TCEA 2007) of law,
    such that it falls to be set aside.  The judge was entitled to come  to
    the findings that he did.

10. In particular, that, although a large  bundle  of  documents  had  been
    submitted by the Appellant now, "Many of these documents do not  appear
    to have been before the original decision maker" and that in particular
    that "Mr Shah does state that he is a partner in  a  business  but  the
    evidence in relation to this claim is weak" (paragraph 4).  It does not
    end there.

11. The judge goes on to say that "He has submitted a copy of a State  Bank
    of India book which demonstrates only  a  few  transactions  each  year
    since 2008..." (paragraph 4).

12. Given that the concerns of the judge were in relation to the  financial
    situation, it is clear that there was ample basis upon which the  judge
    could come to the findings that he did.  There is no error of law.

Decision

13. There is no material error of law in  the  original  judge's  decision.
    The determination shall stand.

14. No anonymity order is made.
