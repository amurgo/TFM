Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr Nasim, Counsel instructed by Rana Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellants are citizens of Pakistan born on 2nd March 1985 and 27th
    September 1985 respectively.  On 5th December 2007 the first  appellant
    was granted leave to enter the United Kingdom as a student,  which  was
    later extended to 31st January 2011 and his leave was further  extended
    when he was granted leave to remain until 27th January 2013 as a Tier 1
    (Post Study Work) Migrant.  The second Appellant, his wife, entered the
    UK on 28th November 2011 as  a  dependant  of  her  husband.   On  27th
    January 2013, he made a combined application for leave to remain  as  a
    Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant under the Points Based System and  for  a
    Biometric Residence Permit.

 2. Those applications were refused by the Secretary of State on  29th  May
    2013.  There were two points raised; firstly in respect  of  access  to
    funds as required under  paragraph  245DD(b)  and  Appendix  A  of  the
    Immigration Rules, the Respondent was not satisfied that the  Appellant
    met the requirements under Appendix A  having  claimed  points  on  the
    basis that he had registered as the director of a new company.  It  was
    stated that to claim those points,  he  needed  to  provide  a  current
    appointment report from  Companies  House  dated  within  three  months
    before the date of application showing the Appellant as a director of a
    business that is actively trading.  The  second  point  raised  by  the
    Respondent stated that the Appellant was required to show that  he  was
    engaged in business activity, other than work necessary  to  administer
    the business, in an occupation which appeared on a list  of  occupation
    skills to National Qualifications Framework level 4, as stated  in  the
    Codes of Practice for Tier 2 Sponsors published by the UK Border Agency
    (under Appendix J) of the Immigration Rules.  The Appellant provided  a
    number of business  advertisements,  however  the  Respondent  did  not
    consider that  that  evidence  met  the  requirements  specified  under
    Appendix A of the Immigration Rules and further noted that it  was  not
    acceptable because it did not support his claim that he was engaged  in
    business that is skilled to NQF level 4.

 3. Mrs Mohsin's application for leave to remain, and now this appeal,  has
    been dependent upon his.

 4. They appealed to the First-tier Tribunal (Tribunal  Judge  M.A.  Khan),
    who dismissed their appeals in  a  determination  promulgated  on  15th
    November 2013.  At paragraph 24 of the determination  the  judge  noted
    the history of the Appellant's  business  but  found  that  he  had  no
    business activity in January 2013 and had  not  produced  any  evidence
    such as income for the business to show that it was up and running.  He
    therefore reached the conclusion that the  Appellant  had  no  business
    operating.  He further stated that the Appellant  had  not  provided  a
    current appointment  report  with  the  application.   Whilst  he  made
    reference to a document exhibited at page 17 of the Appellant's bundle,
    that document does not  appear  to  relate  to  a  current  appointment
    report.

 5. Permission to appeal that decision was granted on 6th December 2013.

 6. Thus the appeal came before the Upper  Tribunal.   At  the  hearing  we
    invited the parties to  take  us  through  the  legislative  provisions
    relevant to this appeal, having provided both parties with  a  copy  of
    the Rules for the relevant period.

 7. Paragraph 245DD  of  the  Immigration  Rules  (HC  395)  sets  out  the
    requirements an applicant must satisfy to qualify for leave  to  remain
    as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant.  That paragraph provides that:


         "If the applicant meets these requirements, leave to remain will be
         granted.  If the applicant does not meet  these  requirements,  the
         application will be refused."


 8. For this  appeal,  the  relevant  requirement  is  found  in  paragraph
    245DD(b):

         "The applicant must have a minimum of 75 points under paragraphs 35
         to 53 of Appendix A."

   9. Paragraph 36 of Appendix A provides that the available points are  set
      out in Table 4.   The Appellant sought to satisfy the requirements  of
      (d) of that table, namely:


         "(d)     The applicant:

             (i)  is applying for leave to remain,

             (ii)     has, or was lasted granted, leave as a Tier 1  (Post-
                  Study Work) Migrant,

             (iii)    was, on  a  date  falling  within  the  three  months
                  immediately prior to the date of application,

                  (1)  registered with  HM  Revenue  and  Customs  as  self-
                      employed, or

                  (2)  registered as  a  new  business  in  which  he  is  a
                      director, or

                  (3)  registered as a director of an existing business,

             (iv)     is working in an occupation which appears on the list
                  of  occupations   skilled   to   National   Qualifications
                  Framework level 4 or above, as  stated  in  the  Codes  of
                  Practice  in  Appendix  J,  and  provides  the   specified
                  evidence in paragraph 41-SD.  'Working'  in  this  context
                  means that the core service his business provides  to  its
                  customers or clients involves the  business  delivering  a
                  service in an occupation at this level.  It  excludes  any
                  work involved  in  administration,  marketing  or  website
                  functions for the business, and

             (v)  has access to not less than �50,000."



10. In respect of the requirement of Table 4(d)(iii)(2) Mr  Nasim  referred
    us  to  the  evidence  provided  by  the  Appellant  which  included  a
    certificate of incorporation dated 22nd January  2013  which  certified
    that Bright Vision Consultants  Limited  had  been  incorporated  as  a
    private company and secondly, his  business  plan  (see  page  36;  A's
    bundle).  This document sets out with some particularity the nature  of
    the business and the Appellant's role within  it.   There  is  specific
    reference to him in that document  as  the  named  director  of  Bright
    Visions Consultants Ltd  and  appears  at  several  points  within  the
    document.  Mr Nasim submitted before us that there was  no  requirement
    for a current appointment report in the Immigration Rules and that  the
    evidence in the form of the two documents taken together was capable of
    satisfying the requirements to demonstrate that the  Appellant  at  the
    material  time  was  a  director  of  a  new  business  that  had  been
    registered.

11. Paragraph 41-SD of Appendix A to the Immigration  Rules  provides  that
    the evidence referred to in Table  4(d)  -  which  the  applicant  must
    provide with his application - was, at the relevant time, as follows:


         "(i)     his job title,


         (ii)          the Standard Occupational Classification ("SOC") code
             of the occupation that the applicant is working in, which must
             appear on the list of occupations skilled to [NQF] level 4  or
             above, as stated in the Codes of Practice in Appendix J,


         (iii)    one or more of the following specified documents:


             (1)  advertising or marketing material, including printouts of
                  online advertising, that has  been  published  locally  or
                  nationally, showing the applicant's name (and the name  of
                  the business if applicable)  together  with  the  business
                  activity  or,  where  his  business  is  trading   online,
                  confirmation of his ownership of the domain  name  of  the
                  business's website,


             (2)  article(s) or online links to article(s) in  a  newspaper
                  or other publication showing the applicant's name (and the
                  name of the business  if  applicable)  together  with  the
                  business activity,


             (3)  information from a trade fair, at which the applicant has
                  had  a  stand  or  given  a  presentation  to  market  his
                  business, showing the applicant's name (and  the  name  of
                  the business if applicable)  together  with  the  business
                  activity, or


             (4)  personal registration with a UK trade body linked to  the
                  applicant's occupation; and

         (iv)     one or more of contracts showing trading.  If  a  contract
             is not an original the applicant must  sign  each  page.   The
             contract must show:



             (a)  the applicant's name and the name of the business,


             (b)  the service provided by the applicant's business; and


             (c)  the name of the other party or parties  involved  in  the
                  contract and their contact details, including  their  full
                  address, postal code and, where available, landline  phone
                  number and any email address."

12. With regard to Table  4(d)(iv),  Appendix  J  to  the  Rules  sets  out
    relevant  skill  levels,  in  the   form   of   Standard   Occupational
    Classification (SOC) codes which are based  on  the  comprehensive  SOC
    scheme designed for the Office of National  Statistics.   Paragraphs  2
    and 3 of the Introduction to the Appendix J indicate that, where in the
    Rules a job or occupation is relevant, the most appropriate  match  for
    that job within the SOC scheme,  as  set  out  in  the  tables  in  the
    appendix, based on the job description, i.e., on what the job  in  fact
    involves.  The various jobs in the scheme are defined by  reference  to
    "Example job tasks", "Related job titles", and "Salary rates" for  both
    "New entrant" and "Experienced".  Having categorised all jobs thus, the
    scheme allocates them to levels within a hierarchy  known  as  National
    Qualifications Framework ("NQF").

13. In his application, the Appellant maintained that he was  self-employed
    in  a  business  which  provided  marketing  services  to   educational
    institutions and a  consultancy  service  to  students;  such  business
    having  started  in  or  about  April/May  2013.   He   described   his
    occupation or role as "Marketing & Sales Manager", with SOC  code  1132
    (which falls into NQF level 6).   The  "Example  job  tasks"  for  that
    occupation are as follows:

         "Example job tasks:


           . Liaises with other senior staff  to  determine  the  range  of
             goods and services to be sold;


           . Discusses employer's  and  clients'  requirements,  plans  and
             monitors surveys and analyses customers' reaction to products;


           . Controls the recruitment and training of staff;


           .  Produces  and/or   assesses   reports   and   recommendations
             concerning marketing and sales strategies."

14.  The  Respondent  did  not  accept  that   the   documentary   evidence
    demonstrated that the Appellant was engaged in business activity in  an
    occupation which appeared on the  list  of  occupations.   The  reasons
    given by the Respondent is as follows: "The evidence does not meet  the
    requirements specified under Appendix A of the Immigration Rules and is
    not acceptable because it does not support  your  claim  that  you  are
    engaged in business skilled to NQF  level  4."   However  the  decision
    letter does not make any reference to  the  evidence  provided  by  the
    Appellant nor why it did not meet the requirements of Appendix A.   The
    documentary evidence submitted with the application is set out  in  the
    form itself at page 48.  It is plain  from  reading  the  determination
    that this point was not dealt with by the  judge  in  his  findings  at
    paragraphs 23 or 24 of the determination where he appeared to rely upon
    the lack of evidence relating to income.



15. Mr Nasim referred us to the documentary  evidence  which  included  the
    advertising and marketing material and also the contract between Bright
    Vision Consultants Limited and Queensbury College  which  he  submitted
    met the requirement of Table 4(d)(iii) and (iv).  The Respondent had  a
    copy of the contract at the time of the application but  had  not  made
    any reference to  it  in  the  decision  letter  when  considering  the
    requirements of Appendix A and 41-SD.  Mr Nasim then  took  us  through
    the financial documentation provided with the application including the
    bank  statement  from  the  Allied  Bank  plc  that  had  the  sterling
    equivalent of �62,000  in  it,  he  demonstrated  that  there  were  no
    restrictions on that money  and  that  it  was  held  in  a  registered
    financial institution and was disposable in the UK.



16. Having taken the parties  through  the  legislation  and  the  decision
    letter, we reached the conclusion that the Immigration Judge  had  made
    an error of law in his conclusions which were set out at paragraphs  23
    and 24 of the determination.  The decision letter was based on specific
    issues  raised  in  respect  of  the  evidence,  including  the   issue
    concerning the registration of  the  company.   Mr  Bramble  could  not
    demonstrate before us that there was  any  requirement  for  a  current
    appointment report in the Rules.  As for the  second  issue  concerning
    business  activity,  we  find  that  the  provisions  anticipate   "New
    entrants" and the nature of entrepreneurship means his business may  be
    only at the "start up" stage when the application is made.  We  further
    consider that in those circumstances the  Appellant  will  be  able  to
    satisfy Table 4(d)(iv) by showing business  plans  and  strategies  for
    growth.  An application for a business of this type is required to have
    a minimum investment of �50,000 available and therefore  such  evidence
    as to how the investment will be made and how the business will be  run
    is likely  to  be  required.   The  Rule  specifies  that  one  way  to
    demonstrate this evidential requirement is to provide one  contract;  a
    document which we are  satisfied  the  Appellant  produced.   The  bald
    assertion in the refusal letter that the  documents  provided  did  not
    meet the criteria does not  in  our  judgment  take  into  account  the
    evidence provided by  the  Appellant.   When  looking  at  the  judge's
    decision, we consider that he  did  not  set  out  the  Rule  with  any
    particularity nor did he seek to analyse the evidence by  reference  to
    the Rule but sought to rely  on  the  absence  of  evidence  concerning
    income and the Appellant's credibility, which we are satisfied was  the
    wrong approach.  For those reasons, we  find  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge M.A. Khan)  erred  in  law  and  therefore  we  set  aside  that
    decision.



17. We sought the views of the  parties  concerning  the  remaking  of  the
    decision.  Mr Bramble submitted that during the course of  the  hearing
    he had the opportunity to consider further the documents in the context
    of the Rules but having considered  the  evidence  in  the  round,  was
    satisfied that the Appellant had demonstrated that he  could  meet  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules and  that  there  was  sufficient
    evidence to demonstrate that he was a director of a  new  business  and
    that that business was registered.  Both parties therefore  invited  us
    to allow the appeal.  As the first Appellant succeeds, it  must  follow
    that the second Appellant who is  dependent  on  his  application  also
    succeeds in her appeal.



18. However, for those reasons, we consider the Immigration Judge erred  in
    law; and his decision is set aside.  It  is  remade  as  follows:   the
    appeal is  allowed.   As  we  have  indicated,  his  wife's  appeal  is
    dependent upon his and succeeds for the same reasons and with the  same
    consequences.



Decision:



The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved an  error  on
a point of law and the decision has accordingly been set aside.   We  remake
the decision by allowing the appeals.
