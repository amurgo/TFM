Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1.  These  are  the  linked  appeals  of  the   appellants   against   the
    determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge Edwards promulgated 10.7.14,
    allowing their appeals on article 8 grounds against  the  decisions  of
    the respondent to refuse their applications for leave to remain in  the
    UK.  The Judge heard the appeal on 4.7.14.

 2. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Molloy  refused  permission  to  appeal  on
    7.10.14 but when the application was renewed  to  the  Upper  Tribunal,
    Upper Tribunal Judge Grubb granted permission to appeal on 12.1.15.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 24.3.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 4. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Edwards should be set aside.

 5. Whilst issue is taken with the way in which Judge Edwards addressed the
    medical evidence, there is no merit in this ground of appeal since  the
    appeals were allowed. Despite concerns about the medical evidence,  set
    out in the decision, Judge Edwards found that on  the  basis  of  their
    health it would be disproportionate to remove them from the UK, stating
    at �28 that, "there are two, prima facie, very unwell individuals  who,
    in my judgement could not face a long-haul  flight  to  PRC,  and  live
    without assistance." Any  alleged  error  made  no  difference  to  the
    outcome of the appeal.

 6. At the heart of the appeal to the Upper Tribunal  and  the  reason  why
    permission was ultimately  granted  is  the  direction  made  by  Judge
    Edwards at �32 of the decision:

      a) "I direct that leave be granted to both appellants for a period not
         exceeding twelve months. If at the end  thereof,  applications  for
         further  leave  are  made,  it  should  not  be   granted   without
         comprehensive reports touching the mental and  physical  health  of
         both appellants being submitted from independent psychiatrists  and
         geriatricians."

 7. In granting permission to appeal Judge Grubb  found  that  the  grounds
    raised an important point about the scope of  a  direction  made  under
    section 87(1) of the 2002 Act, "in particular whether a judge can  'tie
    the hands' of the Secretary of State in making  any  further  grant  of
    leave beyond that contemplated by the Tribunal's decision itself.  That
    is arguably an inappropriate rider to impose on a  direction  even  if,
    which I consider to be the case, the directed period of grant of  leave
    is  less  susceptible  to  challenge  on  appeal.  For  these  reasons,
    permission to appeal is granted."

 8. Ms Mair submitted that the evidence before the Tribunal did  not  merit
    either limitation, as the medical evidence demonstrated a deteriorating
    condition of the elder appellants who both  suffer  from  dementia  and
    have severe and deteriorating memory problems. I note that in the First-
    tier Tribunal appeal the appellants were unable to follow  proceedings,
    their contribution was irrelevant, and the accepted the  invitation  to
    return to the waiting room. Similarly, in the hearing before  me,  they
    sat with eyes closed and gave every  appearance  of  being  unaware  of
    their  surroundings,  with  the  male   appellant   making   occasional
    outbursts.

 9. The parties agreed that in  circumstances  where  an  appeal  has  been
    allowed on the basis of article 8 ECHR, the Secretary  of  State  would
    normally grant discretionary leave for a period of 2.5 years. In  fact,
    following the direction, on 14.11.14 the Secretary of State decided  to
    grant limited leave  to  remain  for  a  period  of  12  months,  until
    14.12.15. I also note that the Secretary  of  State  did  not  seek  to
    appeal the decision.

10. By section 87(1), now repealed, it is provided  that  if  the  Tribunal
    allows an appeal... "it may give a direction for the purpose of  giving
    effect to its decision."  That direction is part of the decision of the
    Tribunal and can be the subject of appeal.

11. The First-tier Tribunal Judge was entitled to  make  a  direction.  The
    question arises whether the direction given,  first  as  to  length  of
    leave, and second as to what evidence  should  be  submitted  before  a
    further application for leave can be granted, can properly be  said  to
    be for the purpose of giving effect to its decision.  For  the  reasons
    set out herein, I am not satisfied that  it  was  either  necessary  or
    appropriate for the purpose of giving effect to the decision.

12. The Rule 24 response of the Secretary of State and as confirmed  by  Ms
    Johnstone is that it is a matter for the Secretary of State  to  decide
    what period of discretionary leave to grant. It was not  necessary  for
    Judge Edwards to make any direction as to the length  of  leave  to  be
    granted. It is obvious that the limitation in the  direction  given  by
    Judge Edwards reflected his dissatisfaction with the medical  evidence.
    The judge could, however, have made observation within the body of  the
    decision to similar effect, suggesting, for example, that in  light  of
    the unsatisfactory medical evidence the Secretary of State may consider
    granting only a short period of discretionary leave.

13. I can see no rational link between the limitation of a specific  period
    of 12 months and the medical evidence. None of that evidence  suggested
    that the medical and mental condition of the appellants was  likely  to
    improve in the near future. On the facts of  this  case,  even  if  the
    judge was entitled to make such a direction  as  to  length  of  leave,
    which I doubt, there was  no  rational  justification  for  imposing  a
    period of 12 months.

14. Further, I find no necessity or justification for the  second  part  of
    the direction, as to  what  evidence  should  be  produced  before  any
    further application for leave to remain could be granted. That, surely,
    is going far beyond the ambit of the Tribunal in  allowing  the  appeal
    and was not needed for the purpose of giving effect to the decision.

15. In the circumstances, I find that there was an  error  of  law  in  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal such that it should  be  set  aside
    and remade, by removing the direction altogether.

16. Ms Mair submitted that  in  remaking  the  decision  I  should  make  a
    direction that the grant of 12 months  discretionary  leave  should  be
    withdrawn by the Secretary of State and replaced  with  the  'standard'
    grant of leave of 2.5 years. For the very same reasons as I have  found
    it was an error of law in the First-tier Tribunal, I do  not  make  any
    such direction. It is for  the  Secretary  of  State  to  exercise  her
    discretion as to the length of leave. There are remedies  available  to
    the appellants if they consider  that  discretion  has  been  exercised
    unreasonably, but it is not a matter that is properly before me in this
    appeal.

Conclusion & Decision:

17. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making  of  an  error  on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside, preserving the
    findings and conclusions of the decision.

     I set aside the decision.

                    I re-make the decision in the appeal by allowing  it  on
                    human rights grounds, but deleting the direction at  �32
                    of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: Whilst the appeal had been allowed, Judge Edwards  considered  that
no fee award was justified because  of  the  poor  quality  of  the  medical
evidence.
