For the Respondent:  Mr M. Hasan (Lincoln's Chambers solicitors)


                            DECISION AND REASONS


     1.  The appellant in these proceedings is the  Secretary  of  State.  I
    shall refer to the parties as   "the  Secretary  of  State"  and   "the
    Claimant." This matter comes before me for consideration as to  whether
    or not there is a material error of law in a decision  and  reasons  of
    the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Harrington) ("FTT") promulgated  on  8th
    July 2016, in which she allowed the appeal under the Immigration  Rules
    with reference to  paragraph 322 (2) and paragraph 245ZX Appendix A and
    C.

Background

     2.     The claimant is a citizen of Bangladesh whose date of  birth  is
    23.8.1989.  He entered the UK with valid leave as a student in 2009 and
    thereafter made two further successful  applications.   On  3rd  August
    2014 the Claimant applied for leave to remain as a tier 4 student.  The
    Secretary of State refused the application on 14.7.2015 on the  grounds
    that paragraph 322(2) of the Immigration Rules applied, in  that  false
    documents were produced and relied on in a  previous  application.  The
    Claimant was awarded 30 points under Appendix A  and  10  points  under
    Appendix C.


     3. The Secretary of State refused the application on the  grounds  that
    the Claimant had used a test taken by a proxy tester and  that  he  had
    completed his application form  dishonestly.  The  Secretary  of  State
    relied on generic evidence of Collings, Millington, Singh and Professor
    French, together with the ETS test analysis and relevant schedule/entry
    in respect of the Claimant. The Claimant relied on  evidence  including
    his BA degree, further test score report and  email  communications  as
    between himself and the ELTS dated 24th March 2015 and 4th June 2015.

FTT decision and reasons

     4.  In its decision the FTT made reference to the relevant  burden  and
    standard of proof at [11 -14].  The FTT considered the  evidence  which
    included the oral evidence of the Claimant at  the  hearing  [28].  The
    Secretary of State's  representative  submitted  that  the  burden  and
    standard of proof was as expressed in  SM & Qadir v SSHD  (ETS-Evidence
    -  burden  of  proof)  [2106]  UKUT  00229(IAC)  [29].   There  was  an
    evidential burden on the Secretary of  State  to  show  dishonesty  and
    thereafter if the Claimant raised an  innocent  explanation  the  legal
    burden reverted to the Secretary of State. The  FTT  decision  recorded
    that the Claimant submitted that the burden  was    "beyond  reasonable
    doubt "[30].

     5.  The FTT found at [45]  that  certain  matters  suggested  that  the
    Claimant's test was unlikely to be fraudulently  obtained.  It  further
    found that his degree was taught in English and  awarded  in  2014,  it
    found limitations in the evidence of Singh that on the same  day  (13th
    December 2011) as the Claimant's test was taken, 32% of the tests  were
    questionable and 68% of the tests were invalid. The FTT found that  the
    Claimant took and passed a further test on 15th June 2013 which  showed
    progression.  The Claimant lived in the UK since 2009  and  studied  in
    English, and his evidence about  attendance  at  the  test  centre  was
    unchallenged.  The FTT considered  the  assertion  that  the  test  was
    invalid with reference to a computer spread sheet [46].  The FTT  found
    evidence to the contrary in the letter from ETS dated  4th  June  which
    stated "because  the  validity  of  your  test  results  could  not  be
    authenticated, those scores from  the  test  taken  on  ...  have  been
    cancelled."   The FTT preferred the  direct  evidence  from  ETS  which
    specifically related to the Claimant and found it to be  more  reliable
    evidence to show that the test was "questionable" rather than "invalid"
    [50]. It was on that basis that the FTT concluded that the case had not
    been proved on the balance of probabilities [52]. The FTT reasoned that
    the ETS letter dated 4th June was more consistent with the  test  being
    questionable, there were difficulties in the generic evidence as to the
    process that meant that a false positive test could not  be  discounted
    as "inherently implausible" and the evidence  of  the  Claimant's  past
    immigration, account of the test itself and academic history  suggested
    that it was "unlikely" to be a fraudulent test.  The FTT found that the
    Claimant was a truthful witness in  that  he  had  made  a  mistake  in
    completing his application form [54] and that the  Secretary  of  State
    failed to show that he deliberately made an dishonest statement in  his
    application form.


Grounds for application for permission

    6.  In lengthy grounds the Secretary of State contended that  the   FTT
    erred by failing to apply the correct burden and standard of  proof  in
    SM & Qadir , and that it failed to properly consider  the  evidence  of
    Professor French that rendered the  conclusions  made  by  Dr  Harrison
    unsustainable (paragraphs 1-23).

    7.  In the second ground it was contended that the FTT made a  material
    misdirection in law by failing to consider  the  evidence  as  a  whole
    including the two statements and the spreadsheet which identified  that
    the test was invalid because it had been taken by a proxy tester.   The
    FTT incorrectly and speculatively attributed to  the  letter  from  the
    ELTS an explanation that the test was cancelled rather than found to be
    invalid.

Permission to appeal

    8.  Permission was granted on renewal by DUTJ Davey in terms  that  the
    grounds at paragraphs 3-27 raised an arguable error in law in the FTT's
    understanding and reasoning upon the ELTS evidence and the  ETS  letter
    of 4th June 2015.

    9.   I observed that in dealing with the application for permission the
    FTT decision was headed as a refusal, when it is clear from the wording
    at paragraph 3 that UTJ Deans granted permission on the grounds that it
    was clear that the Judge made errors in concluding that  the  Secretary
    of State had not discharged the legal  burden  of  proving  dishonesty.
    UTJ Deans found no arguable error in the findings made as to the report
    of Professor French.

    10.  At the hearing before me I drew attention to the  mistake  in  the
    grant of permission by UTJ Deans.  I proposed to deal with the  matters
    raised in ground 2 only.  I found  no  arguable  errors  in  the  FTT's
    consideration of the evidence of professor French.


Submissions

    11.  Mr Tufan relied on MA (ETS -TOEIC testing) [2016] UKUT  450  (IAC)
    at (50-51) where the Upper Tribunal (UT) concluded that the evidence of
    the  spreadsheet  was  reliable  as  to  the  invalidity  of  the  test
    assessment.  The UT found no relevance in the letter from ETS as to the
    first phase of the tests.


    12.  Mr Hasan argued that  the  FTT  applied  the  correct  burden  and
    standard of proof following SM & Qadir at (57).  The three cases  cited
    all referred to the evidential burden on  the  Secretary  of  State  as
    having been discharged on the evidence.  Mr Hasan argued that  the  FTT
    had accepted that the Claimant  provided  an  innocent  explanation  by
    relying on his evidence that he was awarded a degree and that he had no
    reason to use deception in the test.  The  Secretary  of  State  failed
    thereafter to discharge the legal  burden  by  not  responding  to  the
    letter dated 4th June from ETS.  Mr Hasan argued that in any event  the
    test certificate could not be relied on as  it  stated  in  the  bottom
    right hand corner that after two years it was invalid.  He argued  that
    there was no audio recording produced in this case.


    13.  Mr Tufan responded that the ETS letter was non committal and  that
    it was the spread sheet that was determinative of the validity  of  the
    tests.  The case of Shezad & another [2016] EWCA Civ 615 considered the
    ETS position.  The  evidence  as  to  the  Claimant's  degree  was  not
    reliable as the degree was awarded some 3 years after the date  of  the
    tests and not reflective of the Claimant's proficiency  in  English  at
    the date the test was taken in 2011.


    14.  At the end of the hearing I reserved my decision which I now  give
    with my reasons.


Discussion and decision


    15.  I find that there were material errors in law by the FTT  in  that
    it is not clear that the FTT was applying the shifting burdens of proof
    to the appropriate standard following the guidance in SM  &  Qadir  and
    more recently in MA (ETS-TOEIC testing) Nigeria [2016] UKUT  450  (IAC)
    and Shezad (para 3).   There was no reference made in the FTT  decision
    to any evidential or legal burden or  to  the  issue  of  any  innocent
    explanation raised by the Claimant.  The FTT  purported  to  apply  one
    standard of proof, namely the balance of probabilities to the  evidence
    and yet also referred to "inherent implausibility" which is  suggestive
    of a different standard.  I am satisfied that the FTT's reliance on the
    ETS letter as evidence of the test being in the "questionable" category
    is misconceived and there is no evidence to show  that  there  was  any
    irregularity in the procedure.  The generic evidence together with  the
    spread sheet source data and test centre look up tool are sufficient to
    discharge the evidential  burden  on  the  Secretary  of  State  and  I
    conclude that the FTT erred in  finding otherwise.  Accordingly  I  set
    aside the decision made by the FTT.


Remaking the decision


    16. I proceed to re make the decision having  regard  to  the  evidence
    that was before  the  FTT  and  the  submissions  made  to  me  by  the
    representatives.  I am satisfied that the evidence  relied  on  by  the
    Secretary of State was sufficient to discharge the evidential burden to
    show that the Claimant's test was taken by a proxy taker.  I find  that
    the evidence of the "invalid " tests is reliable  as  it  includes  the
    generic witness statements, the test results for 2011 test, the project
    fa�ade enquiry re Elizabeth College  at  the  material  time,  and  the
    spread sheet and reference to the look up tool  to  the  Claimant.   In
    considering if there is any innocent explanation  put  forward  by  the
    Claimant, I place little weight on the fact of his obtaining  a  degree
    in 2014 as this is not reflective of his proficiency in English at  the
    date of the tests in 2011.  As stated above the letter dated  4th  June
    from ETS cannot be read to mean that the test results were questionable
    and to do so amounts to speculation and misinterpretation, and  in  any
    event the letter makes clear reference in general terms to the presence
    of a proxy test taker in the second paragraph.  The Secretary of  State
    relied on the evidence that the test was not  taken  by  the  Claimant.
    There was no evidence produced of any audio  recording,  but  that  has
    little  bearing  on  the  evidence  relied  on.  I  reject  Mr  Hasan's
    submission that the test certificate itself was not  capable  of  being
    validated.

    17.  I find no evidence of innocent explanation of any element  of  the
    prima face case of deception established against him put forward by the
    Claimant.  There was no proper consideration by the FTT as to  why  the
    Claimant would engage in TOIEC fraud  even  if  he  was  proficient  in
    English (MA paragraph 57) and the Claimant has put  forward  none  that
    can be relied on.  It follows therefore that there can  be  no  further
    transfer of proof to the Secretary of State.  I  have  also  considered
    the evidence of the scores from the test taken in  2011  and  from  the
    further test taken in June 2013 and found inconsistencies.  In 2011 the
    score achieved for speaking was  level  6  and  for  writing  level  7,
    whereas in 2013 the score is level 6.5 for speaking and level  5.5  for
    writing.  I find significant discrepancies as between  the  scores  for
    writing such that there is a marked decrease in standard from  level  7
    to level 5.5, and in speaking there is a slight improvement of  0.5.  I
    find that this evidence together with all the  evidence  in  the  round
    causes me to conclude that the Claimant did use a proxy test  taker  in
    2011.




    18.  There is a material error of law in the decision and reasons which
    is set aside.  I remake the decision  by  substituting  a  decision  to
    dismiss the appeal as the general ground for  refusal  under  paragraph
    322 has been met.


    19. The Secretary of State's  appeal  is  allowed  and  the  Claimant's
    appeal is dismissed under the Immigration Rules.
