Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr A De Ruano
For the respondent:    Ms E Sage, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Suad Dani,  date  of  birth  6.4.97,  is  a  citizen  of
    Albania.

 2. This is his appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Paul  promulgated  2.2.15,  dismissing  his  appeal  against  the
    decisions of the respondent, dated  24.10.14,  to  refuse  his  asylum,
    humanitarian protection and human rights claims and to refuse leave  to
    enter the UK.  The Judge heard the appeal on 27.1.15.

 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Chohan  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    2.3.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 11.5.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. For the reasons set out below I find that there was no  material  error
    of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  such
    that the determination of Judge Paul should be set aside.

 6. The appellant's claim was that he is homosexual  and  fled  Albania  on
    grounds of persecution and  after  being  forced  to  work  as  a  male
    prostitute. In a short decision, Judge Paul rejected his factual  claim
    in its entirety, finding it not credible for the cogent reasons set out
    in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

 7. The grounds of application for permission to appeal submit  that  there
    were no significant discrepancies in the  appellant's  factual  account
    and the judge relied entirely on plausibility to  reject  the  account;
    that the judge failed to make a specific finding as to the  appellant's
    sexual orientation; and that the Tribunal applied an unduly high burden
    of proof, despite stating the correct standard of proof at �18  of  the
    decision. It is suggested that the judge failed to give  the  appellant
    the benefit of the doubt. These matters, it is submitted amounted to an
    error of law.

 8. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Chohan  found  that  the  judge
    failed to make any clear findings as to whether or not he accepted that
    the appellant was homosexual and whilst citing HJ (Iran) [2010] UKSC 31
    at �15 of the decision,  the  judge  failed  to  follow  the  guidance.
    "Considering the decision as a whole, I find that there is no  specific
    finding in relation to the appellant's homosexuality and overall  there
    appears to be a lack of reasoning in the decision. Hence, I find  there
    is an arguable error of law and all grounds may be argued."

 9. After hearing the submissions of the representatives of both parties, I
    do not agree with the observations of Judge Chohan and find no material
    error of law in the decision.

10. First, it is quite  clear  that  the  judge  rejected  the  appellant's
    factual account in its entirety, including his claim of  homosexuality.
    As the Rule 24 response, dated 17.3.15 pointed out, �20 of the decision
    both rejects the claim that the appellant is homosexual and any matters
    arising from that claim. This is repeated in the summary  at  �23.  The
    factual claim having been rejected,  for  what  I  find  to  be  cogent
    reasons set out in the decision, HJ (Iran) has no application.

11. There is no merit in the oral submission of Mr De Ruano that the  judge
    ignored the appellant's latest witness statement  in  rebuttal  of  the
    refusal decision. However, the judge noted the  several  statements  of
    the appellant, including noting at �2 his latest witness  statement  of
    26.1.15.  The  judge  proceeded  to  give  a  careful  summary  of  the
    appellant's  claim  in  the  subsequent  paragraphs  of  the  decision,
    including reference to his oral evidence at the appeal hearing.

12. I find that in considering �18 through �23 of the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal that adequate and cogent reasons have been provided.  The
    judge was entitled to disbelieve the appellant's factual claim, stating
    at �19 that he was not  satisfied  that  the  appellant  had  given  an
    accurate or reliable  account  of  his  reasons  for  leaving  Albania.
    Considered as a whole, I do not agree that the decision lacks  adequate
    reasoning, relatively brief though it is.  It cannot be said  that  the
    decision was perverse or irrational. My attention has not been drawn to
    any factual error in the decision and the grounds  amount  to  no  more
    than a rather vague and generalised disagreement with the  findings  of
    the First-tier Tribunal and disclose no material error of law.

13. Finally, I note that at �12 of the decision, the  judge  found  in  the
    alternative that based on the case  law  therein  cited,  there  is  no
    evidence to show that the Albanian police or other authorities mistreat
    gay men. There are LGBT organisations in  Albania  which  advocate  gay
    rights. The case law held that there is a sufficiency of protection  in
    Albania, including for cases involving organised crime, kidnapping  and
    extortion. "On this basis, it was submitted that not only was there  no
    persecution by his stated evidence,  but  there  was  adequate  support
    provided. On this basis, it was contended that the appellant had failed
    to avail himself of the necessary support by going to the police."  The
    judge concluded at �13 that there was  insufficient  evidence  to  show
    that he was at risk of persecution from non-state agents on  return  to
    Albania.

14. It follows that whether or not the judge was correct in relation to the
    appellant's  core  factual  claim,  the  availability  of  support  and
    sufficiency of protection means that he is not at risk on return,  even
    if his claim is accepted in its entirety.  There  has  been  no  appeal
    against these findings of the First-tier Tribunal and thus this  appeal
    to the Upper Tribunal cannot succeed in any event.

Conclusions:

15. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

                  I do not set aside the decision.

                  The decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  stands  and  the
                  appeal remains dismissed on all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.




Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed.
