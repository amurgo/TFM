For the Appellants:    Ms K Wass, Counsel instructed by SH Solicitors Ltd
For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

   BACKGROUND

     1. By a decision promulgated on 16 December 2019, I found an error  of
        law  in  the   decision  of  First-tier   Tribunal   Judge   Fowell
        promulgated on 7 August 2019  dismissing  the  Appellants'  appeals
        against the Respondent's decision dated 22 November 2018 as  upheld
        by the Entry Clearance Manager on 24 February 2019  refusing  their
        human rights claim.  That claim was  made  in  the  context  of  an
        application by the Appellants to join their husband/father, Mr  [A]
        ("the Sponsor"), in the UK. My error of law  decision  is  appended
        hereto for ease of reference.

     2. As a result of the error of law which I found, I  set  aside  Judge
        Fowell's decision and gave directions for  the  filing  of  further
        evidence should either party wish to do so.  The  Appellants  filed
        one item of additional evidence which I come to  below.   They  had
        already filed a bundle of  evidence  to  which  I  refer  below  as
        [AB/xx] and a supplementary  bundle  to  which  I  refer  below  as
        [ABS/xx].

     3.  The  only  reason  for  refusal  of  entry  clearance  under   the
        Immigration Rules ("the Rules") which remains is the failure of the
        Appellants and the Sponsor to meet  the  minimum  income  threshold
        requirement ("the MIR").  However, although it is relevant  whether
        the Appellants can meet the Rules, the only issue for me is whether
        the decision refusing entry clearance is unlawful under  the  Human
        Rights Act 1998, in this case whether the decision breaches Article
        8 ECHR.  The Appellants are the wife and child of the  Sponsor  and
        it  is  accepted  that  they  are  in  a  genuine  and   subsisting
        relationship with each other.

   EVIDENCE AND SUBMISSIONS

     4. I have before me a statement signed by the Sponsor and dated 23 May
        2019 in which he sets out the details of what he says was then  his
        employment.  At the time, he says, he  was  employed  by  BQC  West
        Bromwich Ltd, working approximately 50 hours per week  and  was  in
        receipt of an annual gross salary of �27,548.04.  He says that this
        is confirmed by the wage slips, a letter from his employer and bank
        statements.  The MIR applicable in this case is �22,400.

     5. The Respondent did not accept that the Sponsor was employed  as  he
        claimed.  The reasons are set out in the original  entry  clearance
        decision as follows:

           "We have attempted to verify your sponsor's employment.  As part
           of your application your sponsor  and  your  sponsor's  employer
           were  interviewed.    During   these   interviews   there   were
           discrepancies in the amount of hours your sponsor works and  how
           your sponsor found his job, your sponsor's employer  was  unsure
           if your sponsor was interviewed  even  although  your  sponsor's
           employer is your sponsor's direct manager.   This  leads  me  to
           doubt the credibility of your sponsor's employment details.   As
           a result I am unable to rely on this document as evidence of you
           and your sponsor's ability to meet the financial requirements of
           the Immigration Rules.   I  therefore  refuse  your  application
           under paragraph EC-P.1.1(d) of Appendix FM  of  the  Immigration
           Rules (E-ECP.3.1)"

        That decision  was  upheld  by  the  Entry  Clearance  Manager  for
        essentially the same reasons with some additional reasons given.

     6. I accept as Ms Wass pointed out that the Respondent has  failed  to
        provide any record of the interviews which are said to  have  taken
        place.  However, the Sponsor does not deny  that  those  interviews
        took place nor that discrepancies exist.  In this regard,  he  says
        the following at [7] and [8] of his statement:


           "7.   In relation  to  the  telephone  call  to  my  employer  I
           understand that this was taken on approximately 8 November  2018
           at 12:30pm.  My employer confirmed that the telephone  call  was
           taken during his lunch break and he was therefore away from  his
           desk/PC.  In addition to this my employer  is  in  a  very  busy
           position as he employs 11 people including myself.
           8.    It therefore is admitted that my employer could not recall
           every detail  with  such  accuracy  including  how  the  Sponsor
           obtained his employment given that the interview which was  over
           a significant period of time.  The information  provided  by  my
           employer was given to the best of his ability  and  he  believes
           that he assisted the ECO the best he could when  providing  such
           evidence."

        What the Sponsor there says is borne out also by a letter  dated  4
        December 2018 from Mr Naveed Hussain ([AB/5]).

     7. Although I accept that the reason the  Respondent  did  not  accept
        that  the  employment  was  genuine  depends  on  discrepancies  in
        interviews, the record of which I do not have, this is an issue for
        me to decide on the evidence before me (as Ms Wass accepted).  As I
        come to later, whether or not the previous employment  was  genuine
        is not the end of the matter as the Sponsor has since  changed  his
        employment and I have to consider the  issue  as  at  date  of  the
        hearing.  However, the genuineness or otherwise  of  the  Sponsor's
        previous employment with BQC would indicate whether he was able  to
        meet the Rules previously and may therefore have  some  bearing  on
        the proportionality issue.

     8. The reason that Judge Fowell found the employment not to be genuine
        are set out at [7] of my error of law decision.  Although I did not
        preserve that reasoning as I accepted that the Judge had failed  to
        take into account a document  which  may  have  a  bearing,  as  is
        evident from what I say at  [11]  and  [12]  of  my  error  of  law
        decision, the points made by Judge Fowell are cogent ones.

     9. I begin with the main concern which relates to  the  Sponsor  being
        paid in cash.  The Sponsor claimed that he was paid monthly in cash
        on an annual salary of �27,548.04.  That equates to a  net  monthly
        salary of about �1800 according to the Sponsor's payslips.  I  note
        that those are electronically generated payslips.  They provide the
        Sponsor's national insurance details  and  national  insurance  and
        income tax is shown as deducted (although for  some  reason,  those
        dated January to March 2019 show the  deductions  as  zero).    The
        payslips state the payment method as "cash".

    10. The Sponsor's bank statements in the period March 2018 to May  2019
        also show deposits of sums of �1800  per  month  (although  not  in
        August 2018).  In August 2018, there are five deposits on the  same
        date equating  to  that  amount.   However,  that  only  serves  to
        underline the difficulty  that,  as  cash  deposits,  there  is  no
        indication as to the source of those deposits.  In that  regard,  I
        note that the bank statements also show other large  cash  deposits
        which are unexplained, and it is also worthy of note that the money
        paid in is often paid out shortly  thereafter  to  various  persons
        which do not all appear to be payments for living expenses and  the
        such like.

    11. I turn then to the other evidence.  The Sponsor  has  produced  his
        P60s for the year ending April 2018 and April 2019.   He  has  also
        produced a HMRC letter dated 21 May 2019 which sets out the  income
        which HMRC has recorded as paid to the Sponsor. That  provides  the
        following details:
        Tax year ended 5 April 2015
        BQC (Dudley) Ltd - employed 5 March 2012 to 30  April  2016  -  pay
        �12,203, tax �438.80
        DWP (JSA) - 10 November 2014 to 14 December 2014 - no  pay  or  tax
        noted
        Tax year ended 5 April 2016
        BQC (Dudley) Ltd - employed 5 March 2012 to 30  April  2016  -  pay
        �5491, tax �0
        Tax year ended 5 April 2017
        BQC (Dudley) Ltd - employed 5 March 2012 to 30  April  2016  -  pay
        �499, tax �0
        Tax year ended 5 April 2018
        BQC Leicester Ltd - employed 1 September 2017 to 31 October 2018  -
        pay �14,121, tax �522.40
        Tax year ended 5 April 2019
        BQC West Bromwich Ltd - employed from 1 November 2018 - pay �9,797,
        tax �0
        BQC Leicester Ltd - employed 1 September 2017 to 31 October 2018  -
        pay �32,140, tax �4,649.20
        Red River Ltd - employed 13 August 2018 to 24  August  2018  -  pay
        �39, tax �0

        I accept that the figures for year ended April 2018 and April  2019
        are consistent with the P60s issued by BQC Leicester  Ltd  and  BQC
        West Bromwich Ltd as to the amount paid and income tax paid.   What
        is odd though is the lack of any payroll number on  either  of  the
        P60s.  The PAYE references as shown on the P60s are  those  of  the
        employer and not the employee. It is also not clear why no tax  was
        deducted by BQC West Bromwich Ltd from the  Sponsor's  pay  from  1
        November 2018 to the end of that tax year.  Indeed, if the  figures
        quoted by HMRC are correct, the tax paid appears low.

    12. The Respondent's bundle also includes documents  submitted  by  the
        Sponsor previously which includes a P45  showing  the  end  of  his
        employment with BQC Leicester Ltd on 31 October  2018.   His  total
        pay to date on  that  document  is  shown  as  �16,070.38  and  tax
        deducted as �1,830.40.  Those figures  are  consistent  with  those
        given on his payslip for October 2018  also  contained  within  the
        Respondent's bundle (which also appears at  [AB/14]).   It  differs
        however from the figure given in the P60 for the 2018/19  tax  year
        and from the information given by HMRC as to that tax year.

    13. At the hearing before me, the Sponsor produced only one  additional
        document, being a  letter  from  Mr  Nabeel  Hussain  of  BQC  West
        Bromwich Ltd dated 28 January 2020.  That is not in the form  of  a
        witness statement including any statement  of  truth.   Mr  Hussain
        said that he could not attend the hearing before me due  to  "prior
        work commitments".  He does not say what those are.  He  says  only
        that he is the Managing Director of BQC West Bromwich Ltd.  He does
        not explain why that prevents him attending a hearing  nor  why  he
        did not produce a witness statement.

    14. In his letter, Mr Hussain confirms, as I come to  below,  that  the
        Sponsor ceased working for BQC West Bromwich Ltd in September  2019
        and no longer works for the company.  He confirms that the  Sponsor
        was working "approximately 50 hours per week" but that this  "often
        varied".  He says that the employment was full  time  and  paid  in
        cash.  He does not explain why that was.   He says that any  doubts
        about the employment could have been  checked  with  the  company's
        accountants or the tax office and that personal visits  could  have
        been made by the Respondent.  I note of  course  that  this  is  an
        entry clearance case and the Respondent's  decision  maker  is  not
        based in the UK.  In any event, the Sponsor no longer works for the
        company.  Finally, Mr Hussain "kindly ask[s] that  [the  Sponsor's]
        wife and child be  granted  their  visas  as  his  employment  from
        September  2017  to  September  2019  was  genuine  employment   as
        claimed".

    15. I turn then to the Sponsor's  new  employment.   He  is  now  self-
        employed as a driver with Uber.  He began this employment  only  in
        August 2019 and it was therefore accepted that he  could  not  meet
        the requirements of Appendix FM-SE based on this employment  as  he
        would need to provide documents covering one full tax  year  or  an
        average of two tax years, neither of which applies  in  this  case.
        Ms Wass urged me to take account however of the  earnings  to  date
        which, she said, extrapolated over an annual period  would  satisfy
        the applicable MIR threshold.   It was also accepted by Ms  Everett
        that, if I were satisfied that the Sponsor can  now  meet  the  MIR
        (even if he could not do so before), that is something I could take
        into account when considering Section 117B Nationality, Immigration
        and Asylum Act 2002 ("Section 117B") as to the Appellants'  ability
        to live in the UK without recourse to public funds.

    16. The Sponsor gave oral evidence before me.  He confirmed his earlier
        statement as to his previous employment with BQC.  He said  he  had
        left the company's employment three to four months  previously  and
        was now working as an Uber  driver.   He  had  provided  some  bank
        statements showing payments made to him by Uber.  He  said  that  I
        could if I wished check with Uber as to his  earnings.   It  is  of
        course for the Appellants to produce  evidence  and  not  for  this
        Tribunal, or indeed the Respondent to make out the Appellants' case
        for them.

    17. The Sponsor confirmed that his current level of earnings  is  based
        on a working week of 70-72 hours worked over seven days each  week.
        He has produced an Accountant's report at [ABS/40] which shows  his
        turnover from 11 August 2019 to 20 November 2019 to be �17,188  and
        his cost of sales as �4,297 giving a gross profit of �12,891.  From
        that figure are deducted expenses and fees of  �5,384  (he  is  for
        example hiring his cab), leading to a net  profit  of  �7,507.   Ms
        Wass' point is that this figure, taken over a year would exceed the
        MIR.

    18. The figures given for receipts are roughly  matched  by  equivalent
        deposits into the Sponsor's bank accounts as follows:
           17 July 2019: �377.90
           24 July 2019: �607.88
           7 August 2019: �593.50
           14 August 2019: �618.07
           21 August 2019: �631.27
           29 August 2019: �523.24
           4 September 2019: �713.86
           11 September 2019: �621.47
           18 September 2019: �520.73
           25 September 2019: �526.13
           2 October 2019: �549.79
           9 October 2019: �567.36
           16 October 2019: �509.12
           23 October 2019: �906.80
           30 October 2019: �1002.71

    19. What is not explained however is why the  Sponsor  deposited  �1800
        cash into his account at the beginning of October 2019,  suggesting
        that he was paid for the full month of September.  Whilst I  accept
        that he did not leave BQC until September 2019, it is difficult  to
        see how he could be working long hours for Uber whilst  still  also
        working for BQC to the same extent.  Although  I  accept  that  his
        earnings for Uber increased after September when he  left  BQC  (so
        that he is now earning about �1,000 per week), he  would  still  be
        working about half the hours he is now working (and therefore about
        35 hours) in order to earn �500  per  week  whilst  still,  on  his
        account, working for BQC as he did before, in other words 50  hours
        per week.

    20. The Sponsor said that he was now earning  approximately  �1000  per
        week in his current job if he was busy but otherwise  �800-900  per
        week.  He said that he had  changed  jobs  in  order  to  gain  his
        independence and so that he could work when he wanted and not  when
        he did not want to work.  As an employed person he had to  work  at
        certain times.

    21. Turning then to the parties' submissions, Ms Everett relied on  the
        points made in my error of law decision and previously  as  to  the
        genuineness of employment.  She  submitted  that  the  Sponsor  had
        still failed to provide evidence to explain or clarify his previous
        employment.  The further  letter  from  Mr  Hussain  did  not  take
        matters any further.

    22. Ms Everett did not  challenge  the  genuineness  of  the  Sponsor's
        current employment  based  on  the  documentary  evidence  now  put
        forward.  However, that  evidence  was  insufficient  to  meet  the
        evidential requirements within the Rules and she submitted  that  I
        could not be satisfied that the Appellants can meet  the  Rules  on
        that evidence.  The evidential requirements are,  she  said,  there
        for a purpose to show that the relevant Rules can be met.

    23.  Although  Ms  Everett  recognised  that,  in  order  to  meet  the
        evidential requirements of the Rules, the Appellants  may  have  to
        wait to make a further application until the Sponsor has  completed
        a sufficient period in his current employment  (in  practice  until
        after April 2021), she submitted that, on the  evidence,  that  did
        not render refusal disproportionate.  The position is the same  for
        a person who cannot yet meet the Rules as it is for  a  person  who
        could but can no longer meet them (although that of course  depends
        on me accepting that the Sponsor could meet the Rules based on  his
        previous employment).

    24. In relation to that last point, Ms Wass submitted that the position
        here is different.  If I were to  accept  the  genuineness  of  the
        Sponsor's previous employment, that is relevant to  proportionality
        as the Respondent refused the Appellants' application on the  basis
        that the employment was not genuine.

    25.  Turning  then  to  the  genuineness  of  the  Sponsor's   previous
        employment, Ms Wass submitted that I could  be  satisfied  of  that
        based on the HMRC letter.  She was however  constrained  to  accept
        that the information in  the  HMRC  letter  depended  on  what  was
        reported to it by BQC.  If the evidence from BQC is  not  accepted,
        then the HMRC letter does not take matters any further.

    26. Ms Wass also submitted though that I  could  be  satisfied  of  the
        genuineness of the  Sponsor's  previous  employment  based  on  the
        regular deposits into his bank account.

    27. Although Ms Wass also submitted that the  latest  letter  from  the
        Sponsor's employer did assist, she recognised  that  this  was  not
        wholly consistent with the Appellants' case as it did not show  the
        asserted increase in the Sponsor's salary to �32,000 and  she  also
        accepted that the payment by cash was still unexplained.

    28. Ms Wass also submitted that it would make no sense for the  Sponsor
        to change his job at the time he did if his past employment was not
        genuine as he had potentially prejudiced the Appellants' case.   As
        I pointed out, there  is  of  course  an  answer  to  that  if  the
        Sponsor's employers were not prepared  to  support  him  by  giving
        evidence in person or by a  witness  statement  attested  to  by  a
        statement of truth.

    29. As to the Sponsor's present  employment,  Ms  Wass  submitted  that
        there is evidence that the Sponsor is earning what he  says  he  is
        and that this is continuing income.  On that basis,  and  based  on
        the several sources of evidence, albeit for a  lesser  period  than
        required by the Rules, she said that I could be satisfied that  the
        Sponsor (and therefore the Appellants) meet the MIR.  She said that
        the purpose of the MIR is that those coming to the  UK  should  not
        become a burden on the State.  That the Appellants could  meet  the
        MIR was therefore relevant to that  issue  (and  in  particular  to
        Section 117B).

    30. Although Ms Wass recognised that  the  evidence  of  the  Sponsor's
        current employment does not cover a sufficient period to  meet  the
        evidential requirements of the Rules, she said that I  could  still
        be satisfied that the Sponsor and the Appellants meet the MIR.  She
        pointed out that, although there might be fluctuations  in  demand,
        the Sponsor is working in employment which is not transient.  There
        is a continued demand for Uber drivers  in  what  is  a  busy  area
        (Birmingham).  The demand is not subject to seasonal  fluctuations.
        Work may vary but there is a current and consistent market.

    31. Ms Wass confirmed that there is no  evidence  from  either  of  the
        Appellants who are based abroad.  She also confirmed that there  is
        limited evidence from the Sponsor about his  relationship  and  the
        effects of separation on the Appellants.  However, she  said  that,
        if I were satisfied that the  MIR  is  met  (either  based  on  the
        previous employment  or  current  employment),  that  would  render
        interference disproportionate as the Appellants would then meet the
        Rules.  She submitted that it was disproportionate to  require  the
        Appellants to wait until April 2021 to make a further application.

   DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

    32. I begin with the evidence as to the Sponsor's previous  employment.
        I recognise that there is an evidential burden on the Respondent to
        establish deception.  Although  the  Respondent  has  not  made  an
        express assertion that there is deception in this case or even that
        the documents are false, the  intention  is  still  the  same.   In
        essence, the Respondent is asserting that the documents  have  been
        contrived to show an employment which does not exist or at the very
        least earnings which are exaggerated in order to meet the  MIR.   I
        also accept that the Respondent  has  not  supplied  the  interview
        records on which she relies in this regard.  However,  as  Ms  Wass
        accepted, it is for me to consider this  issue  based  on  all  the
        evidence before me, both positive and negative.

    33. I have set out at [11] and [12] of my error of law decision  why  I
        did not find errors of law in most of what was said by Judge Fowell
        as  recorded  at  [7]  of  my  decision.   In  particular,  in   my
        estimation, the payment by cash of monthly sums of  �1800  requires
        some explanation.  This is unusual to say the least in the  absence
        of some explanation and is enough to raise an evidential case  that
        the earnings were not genuine.

    34. I accept that there is evidence from the employers that the Sponsor
        was earning the sums he said he did,  although  the  latest  letter
        does not show that his earnings had been increased  more  recently.
        However other than asserting that payment was made by  cash  (which
        is corroborated by the payslips), those letters do not explain  why
        that was so.  It is not said that the nature  of  the  business  is
        such that payment by cash  was  the  norm.   In  that  regard,  the
        employer is said to employ another 11 persons.  If  they  were  all
        being paid by cash, that is likely to have required the business to
        withdraw and hold a large amount in cash on a particular day in the
        month in order to pay its staff.   That  would,  again,  be  highly
        unusual, particularly in circumstances where the Sponsor told Judge
        Fowell that the nature of the company's business was online trading
        (see [13] of Judge Fowell's decision as recorded at [7] of my error
        of law decision).

    35. I also note that  all  the  evidence  from  the  Sponsor's  various
        employers is in the form of letters.  There is no witness statement
        from either of the employers concerned and therefore  no  statement
        of truth as to what  is  said  in  the  letters.   Neither  of  the
        previous employers have attended either of the Tribunal hearings to
        give  evidence  notwithstanding  that  the   genuineness   of   the
        employment was  central  to  the  Appellants'  case.   No  adequate
        explanation has been given for the failure to provide  a  statement
        or attend.  I can  give  little  weight  to  the  evidence  of  the
        employers and in any event their explanations are inadequate.

    36. This is not a case where the Sponsor did not have  a  bank  account
        and so had to be paid in cash.  The employer was, according to  the
        payslips, deducting and accounting to HMRC  for  PAYE  income  tax.
        That is corroborated by the HMRC letter.  The company was therefore
        operating an electronic system for making payments (as is confirmed
        by the payslips).   Why  then  would  it  make  any  sense  to  pay
        employees in cash?  Also, why is it that the Sponsor's payslips and
        P60s show no payroll reference?  It is also said that  the  Sponsor
        worked variable hours and yet his payslips show  the  same  precise
        sum paid each month. Bizarrely, the sum paid to the Sponsor remains
        the same whatever the amount of  the  basic  pay  which  does  vary
        between months.   For  example,  the  payslips  at  [AB/9-22]  show
        different amounts of basic pay which however result in an identical
        amount of net pay, due it appears to different  amounts  of  income
        tax  and  national  insurance  deductions.   There   is   also   no
        explanation for the zero deductions of tax in the period January to
        February 2019 notwithstanding the previous  earnings  in  that  tax
        year.

    37. There  are  also  some  discrepancies  between  the  P60s  and  the
        information in the HMRC letter on the one hand and the payslips and
        P45 on the other.  The P60 for the year  ending  April  2019  shows
        earnings of �32,140.76 with BQC Leicester Ltd whereas the P45 shows
        a figure of �16,070.38 as at October 2018 which bears  no  relation
        and at least requires some explanation which has not been given.

    38. I do not consider the HMRC letter takes matters any further.   That
        is based on what the Sponsor's employers have told  HMRC  and  what
        they have paid to HMRC by way of income tax.  It is not independent
        corroboration of those figures.

    39. I accept that the Sponsor's bank statements show  regular  deposits
        of �1800 in cash.  I accept that the figure is  the  same  in  each
        instance and consistent with the net pay in the payslips.  However,
        because those deposits are made in cash, the source of  that  money
        is not shown.  I accept that I could draw an inference based on the
        similarity in sums if there  were  not  also  unanswered  questions
        about the other evidence on which the Appellants rely but, for  the
        reasons I have already given, those unanswered questions remain.

    40. In any event, the bank statements give further cause  for  concern.
        There are regular corresponding credits and debits of various  sums
        on the same day or very  shortly  after  deposits.   That  includes
        payments out  from  the  deposits  of  �1800  in  favour  of  other
        individuals.  In some cases, those appear to be  transfers  between
        the bank account to which the statement relates and other  accounts
        held by the Sponsor, but the Sponsor has  not  provided  statements
        for other accounts nor explained what are these movements of money.



    41. As it is, in the account into which the Sponsor deposited the cash,
        the money deposited is rarely retained and for the  most  part,  by
        the end of the month, the Sponsor has very little cash left.   That
        is not of course of itself  a  reason  for  disbelieving  that  the
        deposits are genuine if the account shows regular  outgoings  which
        are readily explained.  That is however  not  this  case.   Coupled
        with the concerns about the evidence taken from  the  payslips  and
        tax documents, I am not satisfied by the Sponsor's explanation.

    42. It follows from the foregoing that the Appellants have not met  the
        evidential  burden  of  explaining  the  matters  raised   by   the
        Respondent.  Whilst the  legal  burden  of  establishing  deception
        remains on the Respondent throughout, for the reasons I have given,
        I am satisfied  that  the  Sponsor's  earnings  from  his  previous
        employment are not genuine. It follows that the  Appellants  cannot
        establish that they meet the MIR based on those earnings.

    43. I turn then to the Sponsor's current employment.  I accept  on  the
        documents produced that the Sponsor is currently  earning  what  he
        says he is.  That is based on working 70-72  hours  per  week  over
        seven days.  Although I accept what Ms Wass  says  about  continued
        demand for Uber services in the Birmingham area (even though I have
        no evidence about this from Uber or other sources), that  does  not
        mean that I accept that the Appellants can show that they meet  the
        MIR.

    44. As Ms Everett points out,  and  Ms  Wass  accepts,  the  Appellants
        cannot  meet  the  evidential  requirements.   Those   requirements
        require evidence provided over  a  specified  period  in  order  to
        demonstrate that the MIR threshold in the Rules is met.  They do so
        in order that an applicant can demonstrate  that  the  earnings  in
        question are sustainable over a period.  That  is  particularly  so
        where the earnings are from self-employment  which  may  fluctuate.
        Whilst it may well be the case that the demand for  Uber  does  not
        fluctuate seasonally or more generally, that does  not  necessarily
        mean that the Sponsor will be able to or indeed will want  to  keep
        working the very long hours that he does currently.  Of course,  as
        he says, the point of being self-employed is to  be  able  to  work
        when he wants  and  not  when  he  does  not.   However,  there  is
        insufficient evidence to show that he will want to or  be  able  to
        continue to work  at  the  current  very  high  level  that  he  is
        presently.  Of course, if he is able to do so for the next year  or
        so, the Appellants may well be able  to  make  another  application
        which will succeed.  However, that is not a  reason  to  waive  the
        necessity for evidence at this point in time.

    45. I turn then finally to what is  the  only  real  issue  for  me  to
        determine, namely whether the decision  to  refuse  the  Appellants
        entry clearance is disproportionate and therefore breaches  Article
        8 ECHR.  In this regard, I note the almost complete absence of  any
        evidence as to the interference  caused  by  continued  separation.
        The Sponsor says this in his statement:


           "11.  As a British citizen I wish for my wife  and  daughter  to
           join me in the UK.  The fact that I have a child  together  with
           my  wife  proves  that  I  am  in  a  genuine   and   subsisting
           relationship with her and that I wish to permanently reside with
           them in the UK.  This was not disputed in the refusal letter and
           based on my Article 8 rights to a private and family  life  this
           is the reason why I submitted an application for Entry Clearance
           for my wife and daughter to join me in the UK.
           12.   It would not be in the best interests of  my  daughter  or
           for her welfare for this application to be refused as we do have
           the right to live together in the UK as a family unit.
           13.   I feel it would be harsh for this  application  for  Entry
           Clearance to be refused for  both  Appellants  when  I,  as  the
           Sponsor of this application, meet the requirements  outlined  in
           the rules.
           14.   As a result of the refusal I feel that my  life  has  been
           put on hold.  I have not been able to have my wife and  daughter
           join me in the UK and I have not been  able  to  make  any  firm
           future plans."

    46. The only other evidence that I have as to the Appellants themselves
        is contained in the  application  for  entry  clearance.   That  is
        extremely limited.  The Second Appellant, the child of the  Sponsor
        and the First Appellant, was born in 2014  and  is  now  aged  five
        years.  She and her mother live in Pakistan.  The application  form
        shows that she has never been to the UK.

    47. The First Appellant's application form records  that  she  and  the
        Sponsor married in Pakistan and that  he  returned  to  the  UK  in
        January 2014.  He was not  at  that  time  earning  enough  for  an
        application to be made.  It is said that the Sponsor obtained  "his
        first British passport" in July 2016 thereby indicating that he  is
        a naturalised British citizen and not British by birth.   I  assume
        from what is said that he is  also  of  Pakistani  origin.   Having
        obtained his British passport, the Sponsor  moved  to  Ireland,  it
        appears in order to make an application for an EEA family permit by
        exercising Treaty rights as a self-employed person  there.   It  is
        said though that the application was taking too long and so it  was
        withdrawn.  The Sponsor is said to have returned to the UK  in  May
        2017  to  take  up  employment  sufficient  to  meet   the   income
        requirements.

    48. I begin with the best interests of the Second Appellant.  I have no
        information about her other than what is in the  application  form.
        She is aged five years and is living with her mother  in  Pakistan.
        As such, she is outside the UK and strictly does  not  fall  within
        the Section 55 duty to  have  regard  to  her  best  interests.   I
        consider that for completeness.  However, there is  no  information
        that the Second Appellant is not being looked after by  her  mother
        in Pakistan.  I accept that a child's best interests generally  are
        to live with both parents.  However, I  have  no  information  that
        this is a strong requirement in favour of her coming to the  UK  in
        this case.  In particular, I note that it  is  not  said  that  she
        speaks English, she has never been to the UK and there is likely to
        be some disruption caused to her by coming to  live  in  a  country
        which will be unfamiliar to both her and her mother.

    49. The Appellants are unable to meet the Rules as they cannot  satisfy
        the MIR.  That is not a minor requirement  of  the  Rules.   It  is
        intended to  ensure  that  those  coming  to  the  UK  can  support
        themselves and integrate into life in  the  UK  (see  Section  117B
        (3)).

    50. Moreover,  the  fact  that  the  Appellants  cannot  meet  all  the
        eligibility requirements of the Rules is an important consideration
        in favour of the  maintenance  of  effective  immigration  control.
        Although I accept that paragraph EX.1 of Appendix FM to  the  Rules
        does not apply in an entry clearance case, it is  relevant  to  the
        proportionality issue that the Appellants have provided no evidence
        that they could not continue their relationship with the Sponsor in
        Pakistan.  Although the Sponsor is now British, he  is  naturalised
        and apparently comes originally from  Pakistan.    He  married  the
        First Appellant in Pakistan.

    51. When assessing Article  8  outside  the  Rules,  I  note  that  the
        Appellants have  failed  to  provide  evidence  of  the  degree  of
        interference with their family lives.  There is no evidence  as  to
        the effect of continued separation.  There is no  evidence  of  the
        contact between the  Appellants  and  the  Sponsor.   There  is  no
        evidence that family life cannot be continued as it  has  been  now
        for some six years,  based  on  whatever  indirect  contact  and/or
        visits have occurred during that time.  There is no  evidence  that
        the Sponsor could not join his family in Pakistan if he chooses  to
        do so.

    52. On the other side of the balance, I take into  account  the  public
        interest.  The maintenance  of  effective  immigration  control  is
        important.  That the Appellants are unable to meet the Rules albeit
        only in relation to one requirement is  a  relevant  and  important
        consideration when assessing proportionality.

    53. As I have already concluded, whilst I accept that the  Sponsor  may
        in the future be  able  to  meet  the  MIR  based  on  his  current
        employment, the evidence of that to date is not sufficient.  Whilst
        it may well be the case that the family will  be  able  to  support
        itself following the Appellants' arrival without recourse to public
        funds, I am not satisfied on current  evidence  that  this  is  the
        case.  That factor is in any event at best neutral when looking  at
        the public interest.

    54. Balancing the factors in  favour  of  the  Appellants  and  on  the
        limited evidence which I have as to interference with their  family
        life and that of the Sponsor against  the  public  interest,  I  am
        satisfied  that  the   decision   refusing   entry   clearance   is
        proportionate.  For that  reason,  the  Appellants'  appeals  fail.



   CONCLUSION

    55. For the above reasons, the Respondent's decision  is  not  unlawful
        under the Human Rights Act 1998 as  being  contrary  to  Article  8
        ECHR.  The Appellants' appeals are therefore dismissed.
DECISION

I dismiss the Appellants' appeals on human rights grounds.

For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

   BACKGROUND

   1. The Appellants appeal against a decision of First-tier Tribunal  Judge
      Fowell promulgated on 7 August 2019 ("the Decision") dismissing  their
      appeals against the Respondent's decision dated 22  November  2018  as
      upheld by the Entry Clearance Manager on  24  February  2019  refusing
      their human rights claim.  That claim was made in the  context  of  an
      application to join the Appellants' sponsor in the UK,  Mr  [A]  ("the
      Sponsor").   The  Sponsor  is  a  British  citizen.   The  Appellants,
      currently resident in Pakistan, are the Sponsor's  wife  and  daughter
      respectively.

   2. The only issue raised by the Respondent is whether the Appellants meet
      the minimum income requirement.  Issue was taken  with  the  Sponsor's
      claimed income. I will come on to the detail of that  in  due  course.
      The Judge did not accept that the Sponsor was in genuine employment or
      that the documents he produced in  support  of  the  Appellants'  case
      relating to  that  employment  were  genuine  ([16]).   He  considered
      Article 8 ECHR but found on the evidence that the decision  to  refuse
      entry was proportionate.

   3. The grounds can be sub-divided into two.   The  first  challenges  the
      Judge's findings concerning the credibility of the  Sponsor's  claimed
      employment.  The  second  challenges  the  findings  relating  to  the
      proportionality assessment under Article 8 ECHR.

   4. Permission to appeal was  granted  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  EM
      Simpson on 21 October 2019 in the following terms so far as relevant:


           "..2. Permission  to  appeal  is  granted  because  arguably  as
           asserted in the permission grounds the Decision disclosed:
              i) failure to have regard to and/or give  weight  to  material
                 evidence before them,  namely  HMRC  letter  of  21/05/2019
                 setting out its records of the  British  citizen  sponsor's
                 employment for the four tax years ending with 2018/2019;
             ii) on the evidence before the judge, findings and  conclusions
                 reached appeared all round not reasonably open to  them  on
                 material matters, specifically concerning the genuine basis
                 of  employment  of   the   sponsor   husband/father,   more
                 especially, judicial finding of the use of false  documents
                 by the  sponsor  (16,19),  a  matter  of  gravity  for  the
                 parties, and  one  outwith  the  respondent's  reasons  for
                 refusal of entry clearance, and reached in the  absence  of
                 either supporting evidence from the respondent  or  testing
                 under cross-examination;
            iii) an overall inadequacy  of  careful  reasoning  on  material
                 matters, family life ties of the appellants  and  their  UK
                 sponsor, and therein materially  the  requisite  S.55  best
                 interests of the child assessment.
           3.    Arguable material error(s) of law disclosed."

   5. The matters come before me to consider whether the Decision contains a
      material error of law and if I conclude that it does,  either  to  re-
      make the decision or remit the appeal to the First-tier  Tribunal  for
      redetermination.

   DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

   6. I can deal very shortly  with  the  second  of  the  grounds  which  I
      identified ([2(iii)] of the permission grant).   Mr  Mustafa  did  not
      address me on this and was right not to do so.  The  Judge  considered
      the Article 8 assessment at [17] to [22]  of  the  Decision.   As  the
      Judge observed at  [19]  of  the  Decision  he  had  "no  evidence  or
      information about Mrs [S] or her daughter" in order to conduct an  "at
      large"  proportionality  assessment.   The  Second  Appellant's   best
      interests are considered at [22] of the  Decision  but  as  the  Judge
      rightly observes, those are "not a trump card"; in any event he had no
      information about her beyond being told her age.  As the  Judge  there
      noted "[a]lthough her educational and material  circumstances  may  be
      improved by coming to the UK, it is also far from clear that her  best
      interests are served by coming with her mother  to  a  very  different
      culture and environment."  However, the Judge begins his assessment at
      [17] of the Decision with his finding from the previous  section  that
      "clearly the rules are not met".  If there is an error in relation  to
      the first of  the  grounds  (paragraphs  [2(i)]  and  [2(ii)]  of  the
      permission grant), that would potentially infect the Judge's Article 8
      assessment.

   7. I therefore turn to the first ground.  The  Judge's  findings  on  the
      fact of the Sponsor's  employment  appear  at  [11]  to  [16]  of  the
      Decision as follows:


           "11.   Mrs  [S]  has  to  prove  her  case  on  the  balance  of
           probabilities, and a good deal of evidence  which  might  easily
           have been obtained in the case of  genuine  employment  was  not
           presented.  Mr Hussain, for example,  could  have  come  to  the
           tribunal or at least provided a witness statement explaining the
           errors in the telephone interview.  In his absence another  work
           colleague  could  have  done  so.   Most  businesses  possess  a
           quantity of business stationery, brochures or have a website  to
           which attention could be drawn to show  that  it  is  a  genuine
           business  but  here,  even  such  basic  information  is  almost
           entirely lacking.
           12.   There are two letters, one from BQC West Bromwich Ltd  and
           the other from BQC Leicester Ltd.  The  letters  have  different
           layouts and there is no company logo on  either.   They  are  in
           slightly different format but  each  of  them  could  easily  be
           prepared  as  a  Word  document  with  little  difficulty.  Most
           surprisingly, neither of them have any website address  or  even
           email address with  which  to  contact  the  company  which  are
           practically universal in organisations and have  been  for  many
           years now.  Nor  is  it  at  all  clear  from  either  of  these
           documents what the company is or  does,  whereas  most  business
           stationery aims to explain that and convey a professional image.
           13.   This lack of email address or website is not, it  appears,
           an oversight.  Although Mr [A] told me that  customers  purchase
           items online, he could not direct me to any such website.  As  a
           manager in the business, presumably dealing  with  such  orders,
           this is something he would be expected to  know,  and  I  regard
           that statement as particularly damaging to his credibility.
           14.   There is then the fact that he is paid in  cash.   I  also
           hear cases in employment tribunals and am familiar  with  normal
           business practice, so cash payments of this sort are  a  further
           extremely  surprising  feature.    Some   weekly   paid   staff,
           particularly in shop or cash handling environments, may still be
           paid in cash, but it is quite outside my experience  for  anyone
           to be paid cash  monthly,  let  alone  a  manager  earning  over
           �27,000 per year.  The practical difficulties alone  can  easily
           be imagined.  Most cash payments are taken from  the  till,  but
           any given date is unlikely that there will be �1800 in  cash  in
           the till and so cash would have to be extracted at intervals and
           stockpiled.  In practice any shop environment will reconcile the
           till each evening and deposit the cash at the bank, so in  terms
           of security and certainty it would be far easier  to  arrange  a
           monthly bank transfer.
           15.   One consequence of these cash payments is that  it  is  in
           practice impossible to reconcile the bank  accounts  with  these
           claimed payments.   The  bank  statements  show  that  �1800  is
           deposited from time to time but there are also many  substantial
           withdrawals from the account which could equally  indicate  that
           money is simply being recycled to give the appearance of greater
           earnings.
           16.   Finally, the P60s and pay statements also suffer the  lack
           of any payroll number or  PAYE  reference  number,  which  would
           normally be expected.  In short, looking at  the  evidence  [in]
           the round, I [do] not accept that these documents are genuine or
           that the claimed employment exists.  It follows that I  have  to
           find that Mr [A] is not a credible witness and that he  has  put
           forward false documents in support of his wife's appeal."

   8. I can deal shortly with the general point made that  the  Sponsor  was
      unaware that his credibility was  in  issue.   First,  as  Ms  Everett
      pointed out, the Respondent's decision could not be clearer.  It  says
      the following:


           "...We have attempted to verify your sponsor's  employment.   As
           part  of  your  application  your  sponsor  and  your  sponsor's
           employer were interviewed.  During these interviews  there  were
           discrepancies in the amount of hours your sponsor works and  how
           your sponsor found his job, your sponsor's employer  was  unsure
           if your sponsor was interviewed  even  although  your  sponsor's
           employer is your sponsor's direct manager.   This  leads  me  to
           doubt the credibility of your sponsor's employment details.   As
           a result I am unable to rely on this document as evidence of you
           and your sponsor's ability to meet the financial requirements of
           the Immigration Rules..."
           [my emphasis]

      Although, so far as I can see, the evidence from the interviews in the
      form of any notes is not produced by the Respondent, the  letter  from
      Mr Hussain mentions an interview with the Respondent and the Appellant
      deals with it in his statement.

   9. Second, the assertion that the Appellant  was  not  on  notice  as  to
      credibility concerns at the hearing is without merit.  The  Respondent
      was unrepresented at the hearing, but the Judge asked questions  which
      are noted at [7] to [9] of the Decision and which show that the  Judge
      was concerned about the documents produced.

  10. I can also deal shortly with a point made by Mr Mustafa that the Judge
      goes further than did the Respondent by  finding  that  the  documents
      produced are false ([16] of the Decision).  I can see no contradiction
      between the  Respondent's  decision  which  is  essentially  that  the
      documents are contrived in order to show an employment which does  not
      exist and the Judge's findings that those documents are not genuine in
      the sense that they do not genuinely show what  they  purport  to  do.
      The fact that, if the Respondent had made an express finding that  the
      documents were false,  he  could  have  refused  also  on  suitability
      grounds is nothing to the point.  That is to the  Appellants'  benefit
      not detriment (particularly since a conclusion by the Respondent  that
      documents were false might impact on any future applications).

  11. Moving on then to the specific points, I  can  see  nothing  wrong  in
      principle with any of the issues taken  by  the  Judge.   Although  Mr
      Mustafa said that the two businesses did in fact have a website so  it
      is not clear why one could not be found at the  hearing,  he  accepted
      that one was not (see [8] of the Decision) and  that  this  could  not
      constitute an error of law.  Moreover, it does not explain the Judge's
      concern that the letters did not include details of the website on the
      letterhead.  Those do include a phone number so  that  the  Respondent
      was able to contact the employer for verification but  that  does  not
      answer the point that most if  not  all  businesses  nowadays  have  a
      method of contact via the  internet  and  would  show  that  on  their
      letterhead.  Nor can the Judge's reasoning regarding cash payments  be
      impugned at least without some explanation by the Sponsor  and/or  his
      employer.  The point made about PAYE references is also  open  to  the
      Judge.  The PAYE references on the P60s to which the  Appellants  draw
      attention in the grounds are the  employer's  reference  and  not  the
      employee's reference.

  12. There are probably further points which could be made.  As I noted  in
      the course of the hearing, the Sponsor was apparently paid  �32,140.76
      by BQC Leicester Ltd in the tax year to April 2019  and  �9,797.77  by
      BQC West Bromwich Ltd.  Those figures do  not  equate  proportionately
      for the periods during  which  the  Appellant  was  employed  by  each
      company (eight months in the first and  four  months  in  the  second)
      whereas both companies give a figure for the Sponsor's  pay  which  is
      the same (�27,548.04).  Furthermore, the amount paid by BQC  Leicester
      Ltd for the first eight months of that  tax  year  exceeds  the  total
      annual pay.  Mr Mustafa indicated on instruction that the Sponsor  was
      unable  to  explain  why  that  was  so.   That  the  companies  issue
      electronically generated payslips, make  tax  and  national  insurance
      deductions from pay and issue official documents  such  as  P60s  also
      indicates that they have some form of  payroll  system  which  further
      underlines the Judge's concern about why they would pay the  Appellant
      in cash in such circumstances.

  13. There is however one document which, as Judge Simpson  noted,  and  Ms
      Everett accepted, the Judge has  failed  to  mention,  and  which  was
      before him.  That is a letter from HMRC dated 21 May 2019  which  sets
      out the Appellant's employment history from  2014.   The  figures  for
      2019 are consistent with the  P60s  in  the  bundle.   As  Ms  Everett
      pointed out, the letter does not indicate how HMRC has  been  provided
      with that information; whether by tax payments from the companies  via
      PAYE or via self-assessment tax return.  I also observe that there  is
      a large jump in the Sponsor's income between the tax year ending  2018
      and tax year ending 2019 (in  other  words  around  the  time  of  the
      application).  However, the Judge did at least need to deal with  this
      document as it emanates from an independent source.  That is an  error
      of law.

  14.  Although  when  that  document  is  considered  alongside  the  other
      evidence, the outcome may be the same, I am unable  to  conclude  that
      this is necessarily so.  For that reason, I set aside the Decision.

  15. As the Judge observed at [11] of the Decision, there is "a  good  deal
      of evidence" which the Appellants/Sponsor could  obtain  to  show  his
      employment with and income from BQC.  As it is, having regard  to  the
      additional evidence which the Appellants seek to  adduce,  that  might
      not be necessary now as  it  appears  that  the  Sponsor  has  changed
      employment and is now a self-employed  taxi  driver.   That  may  well
      change the complexion of the case for  better  or  worse.   Since  the
      appeals have to be considered as at date  of  hearing,  however,  they
      will need to be reconsidered on the up-to-date information.

  16. I have given a direction below for any updated evidence to be provided
      within the next six weeks after which the appeals will be relisted for
      hearing before this Tribunal.  I see no need  to  remit  the  appeals.
      The issue to be determined is a narrow one and the  findings  required
      are not extensive.

   CONCLUSION

  17. For the above reasons, I find an error of law in the  Decision  and  I
      set that aside.  I give directions for further evidence and  relisting
      below.

DECISION
The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Fowell  promulgated  on  7  August
2019 contains a material error of law.  I set aside that decision.   I  make
the following directions for a resumed hearing:

     1. Within six weeks from the date when this decision is  sent,  either
        party may file with the Tribunal and serve on  the  opposing  party
        any further evidence on which either of them relies.
     2. The appeals are to be relisted before the  Upper  Tribunal  on  the
        first available date following six weeks from the sending  of  this
        decision with a time estimate of half day.  An Urdu interpreter  is
        to be booked for the hearing.
