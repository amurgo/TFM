                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against the determination of the First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Shiner, promulgated on 11th August 2015, following a  hearing  at
    Taylor House on 10th  July  2015.   In  the  determination,  the  judge
    allowed  the  appeal  of  Hajieh  Ahmadinezhad,  whereupon  the   Entry
    Clearance Officer subsequently applied for, and was granted, permission
    to appeal to the Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a female  citizen  of  Iran,  who  was  born  on  22nd
    February 1952.  She appealed against the  decision  of  the  Respondent
    Entry  Clearance  Officer,  dated  10th  November  2014,  refusing  her
    application for a visit visa, in order to visit her  daughter,  settled
    in the UK.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim is that she last visited the UK in 2011 when  her
    daughter gave birth to her first child, and now that a second child was
    expected, she wanted to come and give assistance to his daughter again,
    whereupon she would return back to Iran.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge had regard to the refusal letter and noted that it refers  to
    the Appellant as declaring that she was retired with a pension of  �200
    per month, and there had been a payment  of  �202  in  September.   The
    refusal letter acknowledged that the Appellant claimed to receive other
    monies from family and friends.  A bank statement was to the effect, as
    noted by  the  ECO,  that  there  were  deposits  of  �6,269  into  the
    Appellant's account in August 2014.  The ECO was of the view that  this
    is:
         "Nearly 61 times  more  than  the  Appellant's  disposable  monthly
         income.   This,  shows  so  the  ECO  says,  that  the  Appellant's
         'circumstances in Iran coupled with  her  reasons  for  wishing  to
         travel to the UK are such that you have shown your  intentions  are
         as stated or that you intend to leave the UK  at  the  end  of  the
         proposed visit'" (page 2 of the refusal letter).

 5. The judge heard submissions from Mr Abolfazl Abdi,  the  son-in-law  of
    the Appellant, and he pointed out that  the  sum  of  �6,269  that  the
    Respondent referred to, "relates not to a  bank  account  held  by  the
    Appellant but held by her husband  one  Abolghasem  Rajabi"  (paragraph
    16).  The judge observed that this is the name at the  top  right  hand
    corner of the bank statement, and the refusal letter acknowledged  that
    the Appellant had said that she had support from others, which led  the
    judge to conclude that, "I  accept  that  the  bank  statement  is  the
    Appellant's husband's.  It seems to me that the  Appellant's  inclusion
    of her husband's bank statement is therefore consistent with her  claim
    of obtaining financial support from others" (paragraph 16).

 6. The judge went on to then note the Appellant's factual circumstances in
    Iran, whereby she had a husband in Iran (paragraph  18)  and  that  she
    wanted to travel to be with her daughter  when  the  daughter's  second
    child was born, the first one now being 2 years of age (paragraph  17).
    The judge then said that he would accept the Appellant's evidence  that
    she intended to stay for a short period (one month), and given that the
    Appellant had already visited the UK in 2011 before returning to  Iran,
    it was clear that the Respondent had not challenged this and the  judge
    concluded that the Appellant would also now once again return  back  to
    Iran.

 7. The appeal was allowed under paragraph 41 of HC 395.

 8. The grounds of application state that  the  judge  was  wrong  to  have
    allowed the appeal on the basis that it did because on 25th June  2013,
    Section 52 of the Crime and Courts Act took effect and this  restricted
    the appeal rights of visitors coming to visit family  members  to  only
    human rights and race relations grounds.

 9. On 16th December 2015, permission to appeal was granted.

Submissions

10. At the hearing before me on 5th February 2016, Mr Walker submitted that
    the judge went beyond  his  jurisdiction  in  allowing  the  appeal  on
    grounds that were other than those confined to  human  rights  or  race
    relations grounds.  He submitted that since 10th June 2013  there  were
    only restricted rights of appeal.  I pointed out to Mr Walker that this
    was an appeal that had been determined under paragraph 41  of  HC  395,
    which was before the coming into effect of the Crime  and  Courts  Act.
    Mr Walker submitted that that was indeed the case.

11. For his part, Mr Abdi stated that he had one  previous  child  aged  2�
    years and they now have a second child  who  was  14  months  old.   He
    submitted that the refusal  by  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  was  in
    relation to confusion  arising  from  the  sum  of  �6,269,  which  was
    actually the amount in the Appellant's husband's bank account, and  not
    a sum that was attributable to the Appellant herself.   The  judge  had
    gone through the evidence and seen  the  picture  as  it  was  and  had
    allowed the  appeal  having  satisfied  himself  that  the  Appellant's
    circumstances were both as she claimed them to be, and that  she  would
    return back to Iran after her visit.  He referred to  paragraph  12  of
    the determination.

12. In reply, Mr Walker submitted that he had nothing further to say.

No Error of Law

13. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by the  judge  does  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1)  of
    TCEA 2007) such that I should set aside the decision.

14. The reason is that this appeal was determined under paragraph 41 of  HC
    395.  It was not determined under the latest Rule changes  that  flowed
    from Section 52 of the Crime and Courts Act.  It was open to the  judge
    to determine the facts as he did.  His assessment of the  facts  cannot
    be faulted.

Notice of Decision

15. There is no material error of law in  the  original  judge's  decision.
    The determination shall stand.

16. No anonymity order is made.
