                                     and

                                miss gatinder
                                                                  Respondent



For the Appellant:     Ms Z Kiss, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr N Garrod, Counsel, instructed by Hafiz & Haque,
Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The  SSHD  appeals  against  a  determination  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Hussain, promulgated on  3  December  2012,  allowing  Miss  Gatinder's
    appeal against the SSHD's decision to refuse her Tier 1 application.

 2. The judge held in favour of Ms Gatinder (on the authority of AQ v  SSHD
    [2011] EWCA Civ 833) that her application was continuing until  it  was
    decided, and she did not  have  to  show  that  her  qualification  was
    awarded no earlier than twelve months prior to  date  of  the  original
    submission of her application.

 3. The appellant's application was made on  29  March  2012.   The  SSHD's
    decision accepts that the date of the award was 31 May 2012.  Khatel  &
    Others (s85A; effect  of  continuing  application)  [2013]  UKUT  00044
    (IAC), decided subsequently to the grant of  permission,  now  puts  it
    beyond doubt that in such circumstances Ms Gatinder has to succeed.

 4. The SSHD's appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.  The decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal, allowing Ms Gatinder's appeal, shall stand.

 5. No anonymity order has been requested or made.
