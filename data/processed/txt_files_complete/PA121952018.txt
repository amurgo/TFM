               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     Mr A J Bradley, of A J Bradley & Co, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr A Govan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. FtT  Judge  Doyle  dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal  by  a  decision
    promulgated on 28 February 2019.  The FtT and the UT refuse  permission
    to appeal.  The appellant petitioned the Court of Session for reduction
    of the UT's refusal of permission.

 2. On 2 January 2020 the Vice President granted permission  "in  light  of
    the interlocutor and note of the Lord Ordinary".

 3. Mr Govan, referring to the Note of Lord Brailsford, said that  the  FtT
    erred on the medical report; and that while the second error  mentioned
    in the Note, on sur place activities, might not require the decision to
    be set aside, the first error did.

 4. The following outcome was agreed between the parties.

 5. The decision stands only as a record of what was said at the hearing.

 6. The nature of the case is such that it is appropriate under section  12
    of the 2007 Act, and under Practice Statement 7.2, to remit to the  FtT
    for an entirely fresh hearing.

 7. The member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case are not to include
    Judge Doyle.

 8.  No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
