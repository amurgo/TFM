                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellants are a mother  and  son,  both  Ghanaian  citizens.   The
    mother came to the United Kingdom in December  2004  on  a  visit  visa
    which expired in May 2005 but the principal appellant did  not  embark.
    She overstayed and in March 2006 she met another Ghanaian national  who
    was also unlawfully in the United Kingdom and became pregnant  by  him.
    The parties never cohabited, but some sort of a relationship  continued
    until 2009 when they separated.

 2. The child was born in 2007 in the United Kingdom and is now four months
    over the age of 9 and has  been  at  school  for  five-and-half  years.
    There was evidence before the First-tier Tribunal from  the  school  in
    the form of school reports showing that he had  done  well  at  school,
    that he took part in football  and  drama  and  had  won  a  children's
    university award, but that there had  been  some  concerns  because  he
    seemed to be a very quiet child.  When tested by  speech  and  language
    therapists  he  was  not  found  to  be  suffering  from  any  learning
    development difficulties, he was simply naturally quiet.

 3. There are also reports from his church where he is  an  altar  boy  and
    certificates regarding his participation in extra-curriculum activities
    as well as some letters from neighbours and churchgoers.

 4. On 5th June 2015, when making her application for leave  to  remain  on
    human rights grounds, the principal appellant  said  that  the  child's
    father was seeing the child fortnightly.  By 9th August 2016, when  she
    was giving evidence in the First-tier Tribunal, the principal appellant
    said that she no longer knew where the child's father was, although she
    thought he was probably still in the United Kingdom, and that  the  boy
    had not seen his father for many years.  There is a  discrepancy  there
    which is pointed out at [11] in the First-tier Tribunal.  On any  view,
    this is not a situation where the Ghanaian father is strongly  involved
    in the upbringing of his child.   The  relevant  family  life  is  that
    between the mother and the child.

First-tier Tribunal decision

 5. The First-tier Tribunal Judge accepted, though not expressly, that this
    was a qualifying child and that the principal appellant had  a  genuine
    and subsisting parental relationship with him. It is not suggested that
    the principal appellant can succeed if the child appellant does not.

 6. The appeal turned, pursuant to paragraph  117B(6)(a)  and  (b)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (as amended),  on  whether
    it is reasonable to expect the child to leave the United  Kingdom.  The
    reasonableness part of the judge's  findings  begins  at  [9]  and  the
    following facts and matters are recorded:-

      a) The mother and child live together as a family unit.  Two languages
         are  spoken  at  home,  English  and  Akan/Twi-Fante,  a   Ghanaian
         language.

      b) It is in the child's best interests (see Section 55) to remain with
         his mother because he has always lived with her and  has  no  other
         near relative in the United Kingdom apart from his  absent  father.
         There is no real contact between the boy and his father and has not
         been "for many years".

      c) There is contact between the principal appellant and  her  son  and
         their family in Ghana because she is sending money to support them.
         The principal appellant's parents, the  child's  grandparents,  are
         still in Ghana and, out of  the  very  small  charity  support  she
         receives from her church, �450 a month, of which she  pays  �350  a
         month rent, she manages to send them  some  money.   She  also  has
         siblings in Ghana.

      d) The child has private life in the United Kingdom, as  he  had  been
         attending school for about four years at the date of  decision  and
         would no doubt be upset to leave his friends but  all  his  family,
         apart  from  his  mother,  are  in   Ghana,   uncles,   aunts   and
         grandparents. He has never visited Ghana.

      e) The child has attended the same school since he was  4,  he  is  an
         altar boy and has a keen  interest  in  natural  Tontine  football,
         "with many friends".  Ghana has a  functioning  educational  system
         and medical system.

 7. At [14] in her decision, the First-tier Tribunal Judge said this:-

    "14. I accept that the test of reasonableness is a low  test  and  that
         his mother's complete failure to abide  by  the  Immigration  Rules
         does not affect his position.  However, I can find no reason why it
         would not be reasonable to expect him to leave the United  Kingdom.
         His relationship with his father is not relied on  and  he  has  no
         family life in the United Kingdom save with his mother.  He clearly
         has a private life as he has been attending school  for  some  four
         years and he  would  no  doubt  be  upset  to  leave  his  friends.
         However, all his family save for his mother remain  in  Ghana.   It
         appears that  he  has  uncles  and  aunts  there  as  well  as  his
         grandparents and he clearly has contact with  them  as  his  mother
         says she supports them."

 8. The First-tier Tribunal Judge considered that there was nothing unusual
    about a child of this age moving school or moving area, when the  needs
    of the parents require it: that is a normal part of growing up,  losing
    old friends and making new ones.  The Judge summarised her findings  as
    follows:

         "In light of his young age [and his dependence upon his mother]  it
         is no more unreasonable for him to go to Ghana  with  her  than  it
         would and it would be unreasonable for her to move to another  part
         of the United Kingdom with him  were,  for  example,  she  were  to
         obtain employment in a different town.  All his needs can be met in
         Ghana where he will have family to grow up  with  as  well  as  his
         mother".

    On  that  basis  the  First-tier  Tribunal  found  that  it   was   not
    unreasonable to expect the child appellant to accompany  the  principal
    appellant to Ghana.

Discussion

 9. I have had regard to  the  decision  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  MA
    (Pakistan)  &  Ors,  R  (on  the  application  of)  v  Upper   Tribunal
    (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) &  Anor  [2016]  EWCA  Civ  705.   The
    reasonableness test is discussed in the judgment of Lord Justice Elias,
    with whom Lady Justice King and Sir Stephen Richards agreed,  at  [46]-
    [47].  At [46], the Court considered that there needed  to  be  'strong
    reasons' for refusing leave where a child had spent 7 years  or  longer
    in the United Kingdom.  At [47], the Court said this:-




         "Applying the reasonableness test ...

         47.  Even if we were applying the narrow reasonableness test  where
             the focus is on the child alone,  it  would  not  in  my  view
             follow that leave must be granted whenever  the  child's  best
             interests are in favour  of  remaining.  I  reject  Mr  Gill's
             submission that the best  interests  assessment  automatically
             resolves the reasonableness question. If Parliament had wanted
             the child's best interests to dictate the outcome of the leave
             application, it would have  said  so.  The  concept  of  "best
             interests" is after all a well established one. Even where the
             child's best interests are  to  stay,  it  may  still  be  not
             unreasonable to require the child to leave. That  will  depend
             upon a careful analysis of the nature and extent of the  links
             in the UK and in the country where it is  proposed  he  should
             return. What could not be considered, however,  would  be  the
             conduct and immigration history of the parents."

10. I find nothing in MA (Pakistan) which indicates  that  on  the  present
    facts, the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  could  not  properly  reach  the
    conclusion that there  were  no  particularly  difficult  circumstances
    making it unreasonable for this child to go with his  mother  to  Ghana
    and live with his extended family there.  The family are  surviving  on
    charity in the United Kingdom; he has no contact with  his  father  and
    all his other family members are still in Ghana.

11. The decision in MA concerned a number of different appeals: MA himself,
    three  linked  Sri  Lankan  appeals,  an  appellant  anonymised  as  AZ
    (Pakistan) and another as AP (Sri Lanka). Only  AZ's  appeal  succeeded
    outright.  AP's appeal was  allowed  and  remitted  because  the  Upper
    Tribunal Judge had erroneously  given  weight  to  the  fact  that  the
    children  were  in  the  United  Kingdom  on  a  precarious  basis  and
    approached the reasonableness test too strictly.

12. The application of MA failed, although he had spent more than  7  years
    in the United  Kingdom,  the  Court  considering  that  the  conclusion
    reached was open to the Judge on the evidence, and '[given] that he was
    required to have regard to  the  wider  public  interest  in  effective
    immigration control'.  The 3 linked Sri Lankan appeals also failed, for
    the reasons set out at [86]:

          "The judge recognised that the best interests of the child  should
         be a primary consideration: paragraph 189.  Looking  at  it  solely
         from their point of view it is clear that he  appreciated  that  it
         would be strongly in their best interests to remain in  the  United
         Kingdom with their parents where they were happy and settled.   The
         children would be adversely affected by  needing  to  learn  a  new
         language, and they would be subject to a different  culture  and  a
         different level of  education.   Notwithstanding  this,  the  judge
         concluded that in all the circumstances the three adult  appellants
         had behaved so badly that it would be 'outrageous' for them  to  be
         allowed to  remain  in  the  UK.   They  needed  to  go  and  their
         dependants must go with them ...".

    The Court of Appeal held that the judge  was  entitled  to  strike  the
    proportionality balance as he did.

13. In relation to AZ the  situation  was  more  complicated.   He  was  an
    autistic  child  with  significant  problems  with   language,   social
    interaction  and  communication   and   stereotypical   behaviour   and
    mannerisms, which had led to his receiving  special  educational  needs
    treatment, with regular therapy and specialist  teaching,  which  there
    would be very little prospect of replicating in  Pakistan  because  the
    expertise was simply not available.   At [102], Elias J said this:-

         "102.    With all due respect to the careful analysis of the  judge
             [concluding that it would not be unreasonable to  require  the
             child to return to Pakistan], in my judgment this  was  not  a
             conclusion open to him given the  overwhelming  and  permanent
             harm which would be caused to this child's way of life  if  he
             were to return to Pakistan.  I recognize  that  the  child  is
             relatively young and has not developed significant social  and
             cultural ties in the UK, and but for this autism, there  would
             be a strong case for saying that it would not be  unreasonable
             to expect him to leave and live with his parents  and  younger
             brother in Pakistan.  But the consequences for  him  would  be
             little short of catastrophic ...

         103. In my judgment, the observation of the  judge  to  the  effect
             that people who come on a temporary basis can be  expected  to
             leave cannot be true of the child.  The purpose underlying the
             seven year rule is that this kind of reasoning ought not to be
             adopted in their case.  They are not to be blamed for the fact
             that their parents  overstayed  illegally,  and  the  starting
             point is that their status should be legitimized unless  there
             is good reason not to do so.  I accept that the position might
             have been otherwise without the seven  years'  residence,  but
             that is a factor which must weigh heavily in this  case.   The
             fact that the parents are overstayers and  have  no  right  to
             remain in their own right can thereafter  be  weighed  in  the
             proportionality balance against allowing the child to  remain,
             but that is after a recognition that the child's  seven  years
             of residence is a significant factor pointing the  other  way.
             ..."

    The decision regarding AZ turns on its particular facts  and  the  harm
    which would be caused to that particular child. It is not on all  fours
    with the situation of these appellants and there is no  evidence  of  a
    risk of similar irreversible harm here.

Conclusions

Accordingly, the grounds of appeal do not  identify  any  arguable  material
error of law in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and  the  appeal  is
dismissed.
