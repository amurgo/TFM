                         (anonymity direction made)
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Harrison, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Markus, Counsel instructed by Malik Legal
Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1. The Respondent (RG) is a national of India born in  1971.   He  is  a
       foreign criminal who has had a deportation order signed against  him.
       As such he does not personally merit an order for anonymity. His case
       does however involve his British child.  The  identification  of  the
       Respondent could lead to the identification of  that  child  and  for
       that reason alone I make an order  for  anonymity  in  the  following
       terms:
           "Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)
           Rules 2008 (SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order.  Unless  the
           Upper Tribunal or a Court directs otherwise, no report of  these
           proceedings or any form of publication thereof shall directly or
           indirectly identify the Respondent (original appellant) in  this
           determination identified  as  RG.  This  direction  applies  to,
           amongst others, all parties. Any failure  to  comply  with  this
           direction could give rise to contempt of court proceedings

    2. On the 7th April 2016 the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Ransley) allowed
       the Respondent's appeal against a decision to refuse  to  deport  him
       with reference to Regulation 19(3)(b) of  the  Immigration  (European
       Economic Area) Regulations 2006 ("the Regs").  The Secretary of State
       now has permission to appeal against that decision, granted by First-
       tier Tribunal Judge Davidge on the 3rd May 2016.

       Background and Matters in Issue

    3. RG came to the United Kingdom in  2003  with  leave  to  enter  as  a
       student. In 2004 he married Ms KS, a Polish  national.  On  the  15th
       November  2015  he  was  granted  a  residence  card  confirming  his
       permanent right of residence as the family member of an EEA  national
       exercising treaty rights.

    4. On the 19th February 2013 RG was convicted at Liverpool  Crown  Court
       of eight counts of voyeurism and offences relating to the Control  of
       Prostitution. In summary he had been involved in  the  administration
       of a number of brothels and escort agencies in  Liverpool.  He  is  a
       professional accountant and had in effect managed  these  businesses.
       There were 40-50 sex workers in his employ and he had taken 30-35% of
       their earnings.  A BBC report on the  crime  estimated  that  he  had
       earned ï¿½94, 730 in a two year period. He was sentenced to a total  of
       2 years 6 months in prison and  was  placed  on  the  Sex  Offender's
       Register for a period of ten years. He was  made  subject  to  a  Sex
       Offender's Prevention Order which would remain  in  force  for  seven
       years.

    5. The decision to deport RG  was  made  on  the  24th  June  2015.  The
       decision included a decision to  certify  under  Regulation  24AA.  A
       challenge to the certification failed on judicial review and although
       the Court of Appeal subsequently set the Order of the Upper  Tribunal
       aside, that came too late to prevent RG's removal. He was deported to
       India on the 16th November 2015.  He was not therefore present at the
       appeal before Judge Ransley.

    6. The appeal proceeded by way of submissions only.  An  application  to
       adjourn to enable RG's wife to give evidence was withdrawn after  her
       evidence was agreed by the Secretary of State's  representative.  The
       parties agreed the legal framework. RG had acquired a permanent right
       of residence in the United Kingdom and as such could only be deported
       if the Secretary of State could show, in accordance  with  Regulation
       21(3), that his deportation was justified  on  "serious  grounds"  of
       public policy. The Secretary of State accepted that this was  a  high
       threshold, but submitted that the seriousness of RG's offences showed
       that test to be met.  Having heard submissions Judge Ransley made the
       following findings:
         . The offences were very serious
         . RG had been assessed to be of "low risk"  of  reoffending  in  a
           NOMS report dated June 2015.  This  had  been  accepted  by  the
           Secretary of State who could not go behind it to submit that  he
           in fact represented a current threat
         . The Secretary of State is not entitled as a matter of law to use
           "general  deterrence"  as  a  justification  for  the  expulsion
           decision
         . Although RGs inclusion on the Sex Offender's  Register  and  the
           imposition of a Sex Offender's Prevention  Order  were  measures
           taken to manage any future risk of reoffending,  those  measures
           themselves were not indicators as to the level of risk
         . RG had completed the relevant Offender Behaviour  programme  and
           had expressed remorse about his behaviour
         . RG has a genuine and subsisting relationship with his  wife  and
           child (born 2012) in the UK
         . The Secretary of State was correct not  argue  that  the  family
           unit (including an  EEA  national  mother  and  British  citizen
           child) should relocate to India
         . The length of RGs residence indicates a  significant  degree  of
           integration into British society
         . His wife and child  provide  a  "protective  role"  and  further
           reduce the risk of reoffending
         . Weight was given  to  the  possibility  that  the  family  could
           relocate to Poland where RG's wife had relatives
         . It was not however accepted that RG would have a  better  chance
           of rehabilitation in Poland than he would in the UK since he did
           not speak Polish

       Having considered all of those factors, the Tribunal found  that  the
       test in Reg 21(3) could not be met and allowed the appeal.

       The Appeal

    7. The Secretary of State's  grounds  of  appeal  are  detailed  but  in
       summary it is contended that the  First-tier Tribunal  erred  in  the
       following material respects:
        i) The First-tier Tribunal misdirected itself in law in treating  a
           low risk of reoffending as  determinative  of  the  question  of
           whether RG poses a  genuine  present  and  sufficiently  serious
           threat. A low risk does not negate the risk entirely;
       ii) The First-tier Tribunal misdirected itself to  the  significance
           of the Sexual Offenders Prevention Order which was explicitly on
           it face imposed to "protect the public from offenders  convicted
           of a sexual or violent offence who pose a risk of sexual harm to
           the public ...";
      iii) The determination's assessment  of  why  the  'serious  grounds'
           threshold is not met is inadequate and contrary to the  decision
           of the Court of Appeal in Muse and Ors v ECO [2012] EWCA Civ  10
           which stated that the decision needs to show  "what  conclusions
           were reached and how they were reached on essential issues";
       iv) There would only  be  a  Zambrano  breach  if  RG's  child  were
           required to leave the United Kingdom. The Secretary of State was
           not requiring the EEA/British members of this  family  to  leave
           the EU, but it was a matter of choice for them if they wanted to
           go to India;
        v) The Tribunal erred in its  assessment  that  his  rehabilitation
           would not be assisted in Poland  because  he  is  not  a  Polish
           national. His wife is Polish and could assist him

    8. The appeal was opposed on all grounds by  Mr  Markus.   He  submitted
       that the Secretary of State now appears  to  be  challenging  matters
       that had expressly been conceded at the First-tier; the Secretary  of
       State was trying to re-argue the case because she did not agree  with
       the decision. It had been accepted by Mr McBride that there was a low
       risk of re-offending; there had been similarly an express  concession
       of the Zambrano point.

       Findings

    9. The legal framework for the deportation of  EEA  nationals  or  their
       family members is set out in Regulations  19  and  21  of  the  Regs.
       Regulation 21 reads:
           "21. -      (1)   In this regulation a "relevant decision" means
           an EEA decision taken on the grounds of  public  policy,  public
           security or public health.
                  (2)  A  relevant  decision  may  not  be  taken  to  serve
                  economic ends.
                  (3)  A relevant decision may not be taken in respect of  a
                  person  with  a  permanent  right   of   residence   under
                  regulation 15 except on serious grounds of  public  policy
                  or public security.
                  (4)  A relevant  decision  may  not  be  taken  except  on
                  imperative grounds of public security in respect of an EEA
                  national who-
                      (a)    has  resided  in  the  United  Kingdom  for  a
                      continuous period of at least ten years prior to  the
                      relevant decision; or
                      (b)   is under the age of  18,  unless  the  relevant
                      decision is  necessary  in  his  best  interests,  as
                      provided for in the Convention on the Rights  of  the
                      Child adopted by the General Assembly of  the  United
                      Nations on 20th November 1989(1).
                  (5)  Where a relevant decision  is  taken  on  grounds  of
                  public policy or public security it shall, in addition  to
                  complying  with   the   preceding   paragraphs   of   this
                  regulation, be taken  in  accordance  with  the  following
                  principles-
                      (a)   the decision must comply with the principle  of
                      proportionality;
                      (b)   the decision must be based exclusively  on  the
                      personal conduct of the person concerned;
                      (c)   the personal conduct of  the  person  concerned
                      must represent a genuine,  present  and  sufficiently
                      serious  threat  affecting  one  of  the  fundamental
                      interests of society;
                      (d)   matters isolated from the  particulars  of  the
                      case or which relate  to  considerations  of  general
                      prevention do not justify the decision;
                      (e)   a person's previous criminal convictions do not
                      in themselves justify the decision.
                  (6)  Before taking a relevant decision on the  grounds  of
                  public policy or public security in relation to  a  person
                  who is resident in the United Kingdom the  decision  maker
                  must take account of considerations such as the age, state
                  of health, family and economic situation  of  the  person,
                  the person's length of residence in  the  United  Kingdom,
                  the person's social  and  cultural  integration  into  the
                  United Kingdom and the extent of the person's  links  with
                  his country of origin."

   10. It is abundantly clear from the  determination  that  the  First-tier
       Tribunal applied this framework, and that it understood the threshold
       that was to be applied  in  assessing  whether  there  were  "serious
       grounds" for RG's removal. At paragraph 20 the determination sets out
       the following submission made on behalf of RG:
           "In all cases the public policy exception  must  be  interpreted
           restrictively, with the result that the existence of a  previous
           criminal conviction can justify expulsion only  insofar  as  the
           circumstances which gave rise to that conviction are evidence of
           personal conduct constituting a present threat (emphasis  added)
           to the requirements  of  public  policy:  Regulation  25(5),  21
           (5)(e)".

       This submission was accepted as a correct statement of the law by the
       HOPO on the day (Mr McBride), by the Tribunal and indeed by  the  SPO
       before me (Mr Harrison).

   11. The Secretary of State's case rested on the fact of RG's  conviction,
       and the  submission  that  the  imposition  of  the  Sexual  Offences
       Prevention Order established  that  there  were  serious  grounds  to
       believe that RG presented a genuine, present and sufficiently serious
       threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of  society.   This
       argument is squarely considered at paragraph 21 (d). The Tribunal was
       not discounting the fact that the order had  been  imposed,  or  that
       there remained a possibility that  RG  presented  some  risk  to  the
       public. The point that is made is that the evidence had to be read as
       a whole. The Secretary of State had already conceded that there was a
       low risk of re-offending (as found in the  specialist  NOMS  report);
       the Tribunal accepted RG's expression of remorse;  it  further  found
       that his wife and child would offer a protective role against any re-
       offending. In those circumstances  it  could  not  sensibly  construe
       there to be a genuine present and sufficiently  serious  risk  simply
       because of the imposition of this order.    Insofar  as  the  grounds
       suggest that the test in Reg 21 could be made out if a low risk  were
       established, they are wrong in law.

   12. There is nothing to the argument that the  determination  was  flawed
       for lack of reasons. A summary of  the  determination's  findings  is
       given above. They are easily understood. The Tribunal found  that  RG
       had committed a serious criminal offence of a sexual nature, that  he
       presented a low risk of reoffending and that  it  was  a  possibility
       that he could move to Poland with his wife and child. Against that it
       balanced the assessment of the probation service, his own evidence as
       to his future conduct, the effect of his removal on his  family,  the
       family's level of integration in the UK and the low prospects of  any
       further rehabilitation in Poland. Those were  all  matters  that  the
       Tribunal could legitimately  take  into  account.  Its  reasoning  is
       perfectly clear.

   13. As to the Zambrano point I am unsure where this takes  the  Secretary
       of State. Mr Harrison to his credit  did  not  seek  to  pursue  this
       ground. The point had been agreed in the First-tier.   The  Secretary
       of State expressly declined to submit that the  whole  family  should
       move  to  India.  The  remaining  questions  were  whether   it   was
       proportionate to expect them to all move to Poland or for mother  and
       child to remain here without father. Those were questions  asked  and
       answered in the determination.

       Decisions

   14. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does  not  contain  an  error
       such that it should be set aside. The decision is upheld.

   15. An anonymity order is made for the reasons given above.
