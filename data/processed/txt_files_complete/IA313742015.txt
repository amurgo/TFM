Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Diwnycz, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Karnik, instructed by RKS Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. I shall refer to the appellant as the respondent and the respondent  as
    the appellant (as they  appeared  respectively  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal).  The appellant, Asim Mehmood, was born on 5 July 1992 and is
    a male citizen of Pakistan.  On 8 September 2015 a decision  was  taken
    to  refuse  the  appellant's  application  for  leave  to  remain   and
    directions also given under Section 10 of the  Immigration  and  Asylum
    Act 1999 for the appellant's removal  from  the  United  Kingdom.   The
    appellant appealed against that decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge Hillis) which, in a decision promulgated on 6 April 2016 allowed
    the appeal on Article 8 ECHR  grounds.   The  Secretary  of  State  now
    appeals, with permission, to the Upper Tribunal.

 2. There are three grounds of  appeal.   First,  the  Secretary  of  State
    challenges the  decision  on  the  basis  that  the  hearing  had  been
    procedurally unfair/irregular.  Secondly, it is asserted that the judge
    had failed to give proper reasons for findings  on  a  material  matter
    and, thirdly, that the judge had failed to apply the correct  tests  in
    his analysis of the appeal on Article 8 ECHR grounds.

 3. In support  of  his  application  for  further  leave  to  remain,  the
    appellant had undertaken an English language test at Queensway  College
    London on 5 September 2012.  There was evidence before the  judge  that
    the result of this test had been found to be "invalid."

 4. The only documentary evidence in respect of  the  test  results  was  a
    spreadsheet indicating the appellant's result had been "invalid".   The
    judge recorded [16] that "there was no  statement  before  me  from  Ms
    Collings or Mr Millington as is often the situation  in  these  appeals
    following the Panorama programme as set out in the  authority  of  Gazi
    (above).  The judge is here referring to R (on the application of GAzi)
    v Secretary of State (ETS - judicial review) IJR [2015]  000327  (IAC).
    The judge went on to discuss Project Fa�ade which is "a summary of  the
    criminal investigation into Queensway College London."  The judge noted
    that this investigation had  not  specifically  addressed  the  alleged
    activities of this  appellant.   At  [18]  the  judge  "concluded  that
    Queensway  College  ...  were  issuing  false  test  certificates   and
    fabricating test results during the period in which the appellant  took
    his tests."  Project Fa�ade indicated that a  "secret  room"  had  been
    used to house "pilots" (imposters)  taking  the  speaking  and  writing
    tests on behalf of candidates located in  the  examination  room.   The
    judge went on to state that, "[Project Fa�ade] offers no evidence  that
    the candidates were aware  of  this  situation  and  complicit  in  the
    deception.  I conclude that the respondent has failed to show,  on  the
    balance of probabilities, that candidates themselves were complicit  in
    the deception."  Further, at [22], the judge wrote, "I  conclude  that,
    even if the test was performed by an imposter,  there  is  no  evidence
    before me on which I can find that the appellant was aware of this fact
    and complicit in any deception that may have taken place."

 5. The judge's findings are problematic.  It is not for the Upper Tribunal
    to interfere in a robust fact-finding exercise such as that with  which
    Judge Hillis was charged with undertaking.  However, Judge Hillis  does
    not appear to have asked himself how likely  it  is  that  an  imposter
    should seek to undertake a test on behalf of another individual  for  a
    reason other than to convey a benefit on that individual.   It  may  be
    argued  that  Queensway  College  itself  might  derive  a  benefit  by
    increasing its pass rates but that would indicate that the College  had
    reason to believe that the appellant himself could not  pass  the  test
    and it is also unclear why it would undertake fraudulent activity which
    might expose it to closure  and  prosecution  for  that  reason  alone.
    Indeed, the college would have been left with  two  pass  results,  one
    undertaken by the appellant himself and one undertaken by the imposter.
    If the judge considered it  appropriate  to  make  a  finding  that  an
    imposter had taken the test whilst the appellant was  unaware  that  he
    had done so then it was, in my opinion, important that he  should  have
    addressed these matters.

 6. Indeed, with those observations in mind,  it  was  not  enough,  in  my
    opinion, for Judge Hillis simply to dismiss the "invalid"  test  result
    on the basis that the Secretary of State had not produced  evidence  to
    show that the appellant had been complicit in the deception.  Moreover,
    it is unclear from the decision what weight the judge attached  to  the
    fact that there were no statements from Ms Collings  or  Mr  Millington
    "as is often the situation in these appeals."  I  acknowledge  that  Mr
    Sobowale, who appeared as the Presenting Officer before the  First-tier
    Tribunal, did not seek an  adjournment  of  the  hearing  in  order  to
    produce those statements but, equally, it may be that  he  was  unaware
    that the absence of the statements would be held against the  Secretary
    of State in the judge's written decision.  Had he  been  so  aware,  it
    seems likely that he would have applied for an adjournment.  Indeed, if
    the judge was troubled by the absence of the statements, he could  have
    adjourned the hearing of his own motion.  In any event, it  is  not  at
    all clear that  the  judge's  concern  regarding  the  absence  of  the
    statements was conveyed to the parties at  the  hearing.   The  judge's
    comments leave open the question as to whether he may  have  reached  a
    different result had the statements been put before him or  whether  he
    was simply dismissing the statements as having little  probative  value
    given that he had seen them in similar appeals.   The  reasoning  which
    supports a decision or judgment should be clear to the parties; that is
    not the case here.

 7. The judge went on to allow the appeal on Article 8  grounds.   However,
    at no point has he considered whether it would have been reasonable  to
    expect family life to have taken place abroad (he simply notes that the
    appellant's wife and child are British citizens) nor has he  considered
    whether the family could accompany the appellant whilst he made an  out
    of country application for entry  clearance  or  whether  it  would  be
    reasonable to be separated from the appellant whilst he travelled alone
    to Pakistan to make such an application.  I am also concerned that  the
    judge appears to have misunderstood the factual matrix.   At  [23]  the
    judge records that "it  is  accepted  by  both  parties  ...  that  the
    appellant and his wife are no longer living together as man and wife at
    present and that there is no subsisting relationship in  the  sense  of
    man and wife at present."  The wife's written  evidence  was  that  she
    depended emotionally upon the appellant but that, following a  previous
    unhappy marriage which ended in divorce, she wished to live apart  from
    the appellant for the time being but wished to live with  him  and  the
    child together as a family at some time in the future.  The  words  "no
    longer" indicate that the judge thought that the couple  had  cohabited
    and had separated with little or no prospect  of  future  cohabitation.
    That was an incorrect reading of the evidence.

 8. In view of what I have said above, I have  decided  to  set  aside  the
    decision.  There needs to be a new  fact-finding  exercise  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal.  I have considered preserving the findings of fact
    made by Judge Hillis but, in light of what I have said above  regarding
    his misunderstanding of the factual matrix, I am not satisfied that the
    findings can stand.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal which was  promulgated  on  6  April
2016 is set aside.  None of the findings of fact shall stand.   This  appeal
is returned to the First-tier Tribunal (not Judge Hillis) for that  Tribunal
to remake the decision.

No anonymity direction is made.
