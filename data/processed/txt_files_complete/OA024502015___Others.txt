Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms Weatherall, Counsel instructed by Kingstons
                    Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms Petterson, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellants applied for a grant of entry clearance  as  the  partner
    and children of the sponsor, a British citizen, pursuant  to  paragraph
    EC-P.1.1 of Appendix FM to the Immigration  Rules.  Their  applications
    were refused on 31 December 2014 on the basis the  Respondent  was  not
    satisfied that the Appellants were related to the sponsor,  or  to  one
    another, as claimed. In addition the Respondent was not  satisfied  the
    Appellants met the requirements of paragraph EC-C.1.1 and E-ECC.2.1 and
    E-ECP.3.3. of Appendix FM to the Immigration Rules.

 2. The ECM reviewed the refusal in the light of the grounds of appeal, and
    evidence filed in support, on 29 May 2015. He  maintained  the  overall
    decision to refuse the application, and each of the  bases  upon  which
    that had been reached.

 3. The appeal was heard by First Tier Tribunal Judge  Kempton,  and  in  a
    Decision promulgated on 1  December  2014  it  was  allowed  under  the
    Immigration Rules.

 4. By a decision of First Tier Tribunal Judge EB Grant of 9 May  2016  the
    Respondent was granted permission to appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal  on
    the basis it was arguable the  Judge  had  fallen  into  error  in  her
    approach  to  "evidential  flexibility"  and  paragraph  245AA  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

 5. The Appellants filed no Rule 24 Notice. Neither party has  applied  for
    permission to rely upon further evidence pursuant to Rule 15(2A) of the
    Upper Tribunal Procedure Rules 2008.

 6. Thus the matter comes before me.

    Error of law?

 7. By the  date  of  the  hearing  the  Appellants  had  served  upon  the
    Respondent evidence of DNA tests undertaken  upon  themselves  and  the
    sponsor. As a result the Respondent  had  formally  conceded  that  the
    Second and Third Appellants were the children of  the  First  Appellant
    and the sponsor. The Judge accepted that concession [12].

 8. The Judge was not  provided  in  evidence  by  either  party  with  the
    payslips and bank statements for the sponsor which had  been  submitted
    by  the  Appellants  in  support   of   their   applications.   Neither
    representative appears to have considered that to be a problem  at  the
    time, and instead the appeal appears to have been conducted before  the
    Judge  on  the  basis  that  it  was  agreed  that  there   were   some
    inconsistencies between the amounts shown as having been  paid  to  the
    sponsor by standing order as his net  pay  in  the  payslips,  and  the
    amounts shown as having been received in his bank  account  by  way  of
    standing order from his  employer.  The  Judge  appears  to  have  been
    content to adopt that approach.

 9. Although the Judge set out in  her  decision  at  some  length  various
    passages from the Immigration Rules which  were  not  relevant  to  the
    disputed issues in the appeal, she  did  not  set  out  in  detail  the
    discrepancies between the payslips and the bank statement  entries,  or
    record how often those discrepancies arose.

10. According to the decision under appeal, there were three  discrepancies
    of 20pence each. Thus the bank statements consistently recorded  weekly
    payments by standing order of �381.19, whereas on 17 January  2014  the
    payslip recorded a payment of �380.99, and on 15 August 2014 and  again
    on 5 September 2014 the payslips each recorded a payment of �381.39.

11. The Judge heard  oral  evidence  from  the  Company  Secretary  of  the
    Appellant's employer, who explained how the discrepancies  had  arisen,
    and that this was through administrative error  when  the  payroll  had
    been administered manually. This was no longer  the  case  because  the
    employer had moved to a Sage payroll system, and she confirmed that the
    P60s issued to the sponsor in relation to his employment (which he  had
    held since 2004) were accurate.

12. It is agreed before me that the Respondent did not  seek  to  challenge
    any aspect of this evidence as untrue. Nor did the Respondent  seek  to
    dispute that the sponsor had in fact earned in excess of the  requisite
    Appendix FM threshold over the requisite period of  time.  This  was  a
    genuine and long standing employment.

13. The position that the Judge was faced  with  was  therefore  a  genuine
    subsisting family relationship between the sponsor and the  Appellants,
    and applications for entry clearance for settlement  by  his  wife  and
    children that both parties agreed failed to meet  the  requirements  of
    the Immigration Rules not because the sponsor did not earn in excess of
    the Appendix FM threshold, but because there was  an  inconsistency  on
    three occasions between the various documents filed in support  of  the
    applications that in value amounted to a discrepancy  of  60pence,  and
    for  which  an  explanation  had  been  provided  by  the  third  party
    responsible for the error  which  the  Respondent  had  not  sought  to
    challenge.

14. It is agreed before me by both parties that  the  Judge's  decision  to
    allow the appeals pursuant to the Immigration Rules  resulted  from  an
    error of law, because both parties were  agreed  before  her  that  the
    Immigration  Rules  were  not  met  because,   however   trivial,   the
    inconsistencies in the documents  as  set  out  above  meant  that  the
    evidential requirements of Appendix FM-SE were not met.  That  decision
    must be set aside, and remade.

   Conclusions

15.   As set out above, the appeals under the  Immigration  Rules  must  be
    dismissed. There is no scope for any other conclusion  based  upon  the
    proposition that the applications were an extremely close "near  miss",
    since the starting point for such a proposition is that the Rules  were
    not complied with; Miah [2012] EWCA Civ 261

16. The grounds of appeal did however raise an  Article  8  appeal.  In  my
    consideration of the Article 8 appeal I have to determine the following
    separate questions:

           . Is there an interference with the right to respect for private
             life  (which  includes  the  right  to  physical   and   moral
             integrity) and family life?

           . If so will such interference have consequences of such gravity
             as to potentially engage Article 8?

           . Is that interference in accordance with the law?

           . Does that interference have legitimate aims?

           . Is the interference proportionate in a democratic  society  to
             the legitimate aim to be achieved?

17. Given the concession made by  the  Respondent  before  the  Judge,  the
    position is that the decisions to refuse entry clearance did engage the
    Article 8 rights of both the sponsor and the Appellants,  since  it  is
    accepted that they enjoy "family life" together  for  the  purposes  of
    Article 8. The interference is however in accordance with the law,  and
    had legitimate aims. There can be no issue  that  the  decisions  under
    appeal were made in the pursuit of a legitimate aim; the protection  of
    the economic  security  of  the  UK,  and  the  maintenance  of  public
    confidence in immigration controls.

18. Although the Judge did not make any reference to this in the course  of
    her decision, and indeed she appears to have been  led  astray  by  the
    manner in which the parties presented their respective  arguments,  the
    real thrust of the Appellants' case ought to have been (as both parties
    now  accept)  that  their  marginal  failure  to  meet  the  evidential
    requirements was relevant to the issue of the  proportionality  of  the
    decisions under appeal; Patel [2013]  UKSC  72.  As  explained  by  the
    President in Chau Le (Immigration Rules - de minimis principle)  [2016]
    UKUT 186 @13, such a marginal failure may be relevant in the Article  8
    context.

19. The evidential requirements set out in  Appendix  FM-SE  do  constitute
    "bright line" rules. They are either met, or, as in this case they  are
    not. As the President warned in Chau Le [17], "bright line" rules  must
    be given their full and literal effect. It might well be  thought  that
    in this example the result is one that is unduly harsh, or austere. The
    Judge was in my judgement of that view [20-21] and I would not disagree
    with her. As the  President  explained  however  the  relief  from  the
    consequences of this result is to be  found  in  three  ways;  (i)  the
    Respondent's ability to  use  her  residual  discretion  to  waive  the
    evidential requirements for this family, (ii) their own ability to make
    a fresh application, or, (iii) their ability to assert that the  result
    is unduly harsh and disproportionate given that a qualified human right
    is in play.

20. The Respondent has not used her residual discretion.

21. The Appellants could indeed make fresh applications, and on the face of
    the evidence before me they would be able to do so successfully if  the
    sponsor's circumstances have not changed. I am told that they have not.
    It is plain that there would  however  be  a  consequential  cost,  and
    delay, in their doing so, from which the Appellants ask to be  relieved
    through my remaking the decisions on the appeals so as to allow them on
    Article 8 grounds.

22. I note that the applications which led to the  decisions  under  appeal
    were  made  in  August  2014.  There  has  therefore  been  a  terrible
    cumulative delay, in the  processing  of  those  applications  and  the
    consequent appeals before both the First Tier Tribunal  and  the  Upper
    Tribunal, so that almost two years have now passed. The Appellants have
    also been put to significant expense both in rebutting the Respondent's
    stance upon whether they were genuinely related to one another, and  in
    the pursuit of these appeals. Given that two children are  involved,  I
    am not satisfied that on these facts the public interest is  served  by
    requiring the Appellants to lodge fresh applications and to  start  the
    process all over again. (I do not consider relevant to my  decision  in
    this respect the fact that the Appellants  had  made  applications  for
    entry clearance in 2013 that were also refused because  the  Respondent
    was not satisfied the financial requirements were  met,  and  that  the
    Appellants lodged these 2014 applications rather  than  pursue  appeals
    against those refusals.)

23. I am satisfied from her comments that  had  the  Judge  approached  the
    appeals upon the correct legal basis that she would have concluded that
    there  were  compelling  compassionate  circumstances  that  meant  the
    refusal  to  grant  entry  clearance  to  the  Appellants  led  to   an
    unjustifiably harsh outcome. I agree, and I therefore allow the appeals
    on Article 8 grounds.

    DECISION

    The Decision of the First Tier Tribunal  which  was  promulgated  on  1
    December 2014 did involve the making of an error of law.  The  decision
    to allow the appeals under the Immigration  Rules  is  accordingly  set
    aside.

    I remake the Decision on the appeals so as to dismiss the appeal  under
    the Immigration Rules, and to allow the appeals on Article 8 grounds.

Direction regarding anonymity - Rule 14 Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)
Rules 2008

Unless and until the Tribunal directs otherwise the Appellants  are  granted
anonymity throughout these  proceedings.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
shall directly or indirectly identify them. This direction applies  both  to
the Appellants and to the Respondent. Failure to comply with this  direction
could lead to proceedings being brought for contempt of court.
