                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. This is the Appellant's appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge J. McIntosh promulgated on the  9th  February  2016  in
      which  he  dismissed  the  Appellant's  appeal  on   asylum   grounds,
      humanitarian protection grounds, under the Immigration Rules and under
      the ECHR.




   Background

   2. The Appellant is a citizen of Iran who was born on the 21st  September
      1986.  The Appellant initially arrived in the United  Kingdom  on  the
      23rd June 2011 and claimed asylum.  His initial asylum application was
      refused on the 15th July 2011, and he sought to appeal  that  decision
      to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Williams
      refused that appeal in September 2011 and that decision was upheld  by
      Deputy Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Alis  on  the  16th  April  2012.   The
      Respondent received further submissions on behalf of the Appellant  on
      the 20th March 2015, which formed the basis of the  decision  appealed
      to the  First-tier  Tribunal  dated  the  14th  September  2015.   The
      Respondent rejected the  Appellant's  further  claim  for  asylum  and
      humanitarian protection.

   3.   It is the Appellant's case that he is an atheist  who  has  rejected
      Islam in a very public way on  social  media,  which  he  claimed  was
      likely to attract the adverse attention  of  the  Iranian  authorities
      were he to be returned.  It is his case that he  has  become  involved
      with a Council of Ex-Muslims of Britain (CEMB) and that  there  was  a
      letter  dated  the  17th  December  2015  from  Maryam  Namazie,   the
      spokesperson of the organisation, confirming that  he  was  an  active
      member within the organisation, together with similar letters that had
      been written dated the 2nd June 2014 and the 12th March 2015.   It  is
      his case that as a result  of  his  activities  on  social  media  and
      attending demonstrations in London he would be detained and killed  by
      the Iranian authorities and that his brother has been  threatened  and
      informed that the authorities will kill the Appellant because  of  his
      decision to leave Islam.  The Appellant also argued that he  would  be
      required to complete military service upon return, because although he
      is  no  longer  of  compulsory  age,  he  would  be  seen  as   having
      deliberately delayed his military service.

   The Decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge McIntosh

   4. Within the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge McIntosh,  the  Judge
      found at [29] that the Appellant's evidence was that  whilst  in  Iran
      neither he nor his family were particularly religious and that  during
      that time he did not come to the attention of  the  authorities.   The
      Judge found that the Appellant's  involvement  with  the  CEMB  as  an
      atheist arose a considerable time after he left Iran  and  that  there
      was nothing significant in the Appellant's conduct to attract  adverse
      attention of the Iranian authorities, having reference to the case  of
      AB and Others (Internet Activity - State of Evidence) Iran [2015] UKUT
      0257 (IAC) at [29].  The Judge found that the Appellant's  involvement
      with the CEMB was minimal and that his activities on social media were
      limited and that in  such  circumstances  his  profile  would  not  be
      regarded as prominent.  He found that the Appellant did not  have  any
      particular political or religious views prior to leaving Iran  and  he
      would have been of little interest to the authorities when he left and
      further found that he was not satisfied that the  Appellant  held  any
      particularly strong views in respect of religion or politics now.

   5. The First-tier Tribunal Judge went on to consider the  effect  of  the
      Appellant's departure from Iran in relation to his risk on return  and
      how the Country Information and Guidance at paragraph  5.1.6  referred
      to a fine being imposed for leaving Iran illegally.  The  Judge  noted
      how Dr Kakhki, a special advisor to the Centre for  Criminal  Law  and
      Justice and Associate for the Centre for  Iranian  Studies  at  Durham
      University had stated in a general report on  the  risk  of  returning
      dated the 5th December 2014 that:

      "According  to  a  new  amendment  of  Article  34  of  Passport   Law
      (21/1/1020) any Iranian who leaves the country  illegally,  without  a
      valid passport or  similar  travel  documents  will  be  sentenced  to
      between one and three years' imprisonment, or receive a  fine  between
      500,000 and 3,000,000 Tomans (approximately �108 to �650)".

   6. The Judge went on  to  find  that  on  the  evidence  before  him  the
      Appellant  did  not  have  a  well-founded  fear  of  persecution  for
      convention reasons as the Appellant did not have an active involvement
      on social media relating  to  his  conduct  as  an  atheist  and  that
      although the Appellant  left  Iran  illegally  there  was  no  adverse
      interest in respect of his departure.  The Judge went on to find  that
      in respect of his failure to complete military service  the  Appellant
      had not indicated that he would be ill-treated  as  a  result  of  his
      failure to complete military service at an appropriate time  and  that
      the Appellant  had  not  established  that  he  would  be  subject  to
      persecution  or  a  real  risk  of  serious  harm  upon  return.   The
      Appellant's  appeal  was  therefore  dismissed  on   asylum   grounds,
      humanitarian protection grounds, under the Immigration Rules and  also
      under the ECHR, the Judge having found that the Appellant did not have
      a family or private life sufficient  to  allow  his  appeal  on  Human
      Rights grounds under Article 8.

   7. The Appellant  has  sought  to  appeal  that  decision  to  the  Upper
      Tribunal.

   The Grounds of Appeal

   8. Within the Grounds of Appeal it  is  argued,  inter  alia,  that  even
      though the Judge found that  the  Appellant's  internet  activity  was
      minimal, which was not accepted, that this did not negate the risk  in
      view of the Upper Tribunal's  decision  in  AB  and  Others  (Internet
      Activity - State of Evidence) Iran [2015]  UKUT  0257  (IAC).   It  is
      argued  that  sur  place  activities  can  be  much  more  significant
      activities before leaving the country  of  origin  and  that  lack  of
      activity prior to flight is no basis to reject a  sur  place  activity
      claim.  It is further argued that the Judge appeared  to  accept  that
      there were dangers relating to illegal exit but then  gave  no  reason
      for finding that the Appellant will not be at risk  at  [32].   It  is
      argued that the Judge has given insufficient reasons in respect of his
      findings that the Appellant will not be at  risk  and  has  failed  to
      properly deal with the case of AB and Others and the findings  of  the
      Upper Tribunal between paragraphs 448 and 450 of that decision.

   The Grant of Permission to Appeal

   9. Permission to appeal in this  case  has  been  granted  by  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Landes on the 15th March 2016, on the grounds  that  it
      is arguable that the  decision  was  insufficiently  reasoned  and  in
      particular that the Judge failed to deal with what  was  said  in  the
      case of AB and Others (Internet Activity -  State  of  Evidence)  Iran
      [2015] UKUT 0257.  It was stated that the Judge had  referred  to  the
      finding that the Appellant had left  Iran  illegally  and  accordingly
      bearing in mind the quote from Dr Kakhki's report the Appellant  would
      arguably be someone who on return fell within the "pinch point"  noted
      in AB and that it was arguable that  even  minimal  activity  did  not
      negate risk and that the Judge's reasoning that the Appellant did  not
      have a well-founded fear of persecution because he  did  not  have  an
      active involvement on social media  relating  to  his  conduct  as  an
      atheist was inadequately reasoned.

   The Rule 24 Reply

  10. Within the Rule 24 reply dated the 24th  March  2016,  the  Respondent
      argues  that  the   First-tier   Tribunal   Judge   directed   himself
      appropriately and that the Judge did have regard  to  the  submissions
      made in respect of the case of AB and that it should be noted that the
      primary finding of AB was that there was not sufficient  evidence  for
      the panel to be able to give formal country guidance on the issue.  It
      was argued that a balanced reading of AB would show that  the  Judge's
      comments were a reasonable reflection of the overall findings.

  11. It is on that basis that the  appeal  came  before  me  in  the  Upper
      Tribunal.

   Oral Submissions

  12. In his oral submissions Mr De Ruano relied upon the written Grounds of
      Appeal and argued that there was a clear material error of law in  the
      way that the Judge dealt with the  Appellant's  risk  upon  return  in
      light of the case of AB and  Others  (Internet  Activity  -  State  of
      Evidence) Iran [2015] UKUT 0257, and said that he could not  add  much
      to the detailed reasons given within paragraphs 4 to  8  inclusive  of
      the Grounds of Appeal, which he relied upon.

  13. Mr Duffy on behalf of the Respondent sought to argue that although the
      case of AB and Others was  authority  for  the  proposition  that  the
      greater the level of activity the greater the risk, he argued that the
      case of AB and Others had not come to clear conclusions and that clear
      country guidance was not given regarding  the  activities  that  would
      lead to risk and that the Judge's analysis of AB and Others was a fair
      reading of the case and that there was no material error.   He  argued
      that even if there was an error, it was not material,  as  the  result
      would have been the same in any event given the low level of  internet
      activity undertaken by the Appellant.

  14. In his submissions in reply, Mr De Ruano submitted that the case of AB
      and Others had indicated that even a low level of activity could  give
      rise to a real risk of persecution and that the Judge's  analysis  did
      reveal a material error of law.

   My Findings on Error of Law and Materiality

  15. The head note in the case of AB and Others (Internet Activity -  State
      of Evidence) Iran [2015] UKUT  0257  (IAC)  reads  "the  material  put
      before the Tribunal did not disclose a sufficient evidential basis for
      giving country or other guidance upon what, reliably, can be  expected
      in terms of the reception in Iran for those returning  otherwise  than
      with a 'regular' passport in relation to whom interest may be  excited
      from the authorities into internet activity as might be revealed by an
      examination of blogging activity or a Facebook account.  However, this
      determination is reported so that the evidence considered by the Upper
      Tribunal is available in the public domain".

  16. However, when one actually reads the decision within  AB  and  Others,
      although  not  giving  full  and  comprehensive  guidance,  the  Upper
      Tribunal did make specific findings which are of significant relevance
      to this case.

  17. The Upper Tribunal found specifically within AB and Others that:

      "455.  We do reject Mr  Rawat's  submission  that  a  high  degree  of
      activity is necessary to attract persecution.  It is probably the case
      that the more active persons are, the  more  likely  they  are  to  be
      persecuted, but the reverse just does not apply.   We  find  that  the
      authorities do not chase everyone who just might be an  opponent,  but
      if that opponent comes to their attention for some  reason  then  that
      person might be in quite serious trouble  for  conduct  which  to  the
      ideas of western liberal society seems of little consequence.

      456.  The fact that people who do not seem to be of  any  interest  to
      the authorities have no trouble on return is not  really  significant.
      Although Iran might be described as exceedingly  touchy  there  is  no
      reason to assume that the State persecutes everyone and the mere  fact
      of being in the United Kingdom for a prolonged period does not lead to
      persecution.  It may lead to scrutiny and that  is  what  concerns  us
      most.  The fact is that although there may be quite a large number  of
      people who choose to go to Iran their  fate  is  of  little  value  in
      determining what risk, if any, might be faced by a person who  is  not
      willing to return.  Clearly an Iranian citizen  is  more  likely  than
      someone not familiar with the country to appreciate the risks that  he
      or she really faces in the event of return.  A person with no profile,
      with nothing to hide and whose biggest fault is to have overstayed  in
      another country may well feel that he  has  done  nothing  to  attract
      attention and will therefore go home.  Such a person may well be right
      and will not produce statistics showing a risk of persecution.

      247.  We accept the evidence that some people  who  have  expected  no
      trouble have found trouble and that does concern us.  We  also  accept
      the evidence that very few people seem to be returned unwillingly  and
      this makes it very difficult to predict with any degree of  confidence
      what fate, if any, awaits them.  There is  clear  evidence  that  some
      people are asked about their internet activity  and  particularly  for
      their Facebook password.  We can think  of  no  reason  whatsoever  to
      doubt this  evidence.   It  is  absolutely  clear  that  blogging  and
      activities on Facebook are very common amongst Iranian citizens and it
      is very clear that the Iranian  authorities  are  exceedingly  twitchy
      about them.  We  cannot  see  why  a  person  who  would  attract  the
      authorities sufficiently to be interrogated and asked to give  account
      of his conduct outside of Iran, would not be asked what he had done on
      the internet.  Such a person could not  be  expected  to  lie,  partly
      because that is how the law is developed and  partly  because,  as  is
      illustrated in one of the examples given above, it is often quite easy
      to check up and expose such  a  person.   We  find  that  the  act  of
      returning someone creates  a  'pinch  point'  so  that  returnees  are
      brought into direct contact with the authorities in Iran who have both
      the time and inclination to interrogate them.  We think it likely that
      they would be asked about their internet activity and likely  if  they
      have any internet activity for that to be exposed and if that is  less
      than flattering of  the  government  to  lead  to  the  real  risk  of
      persecution".

  18. The case of AB and Others therefore does establish  that  people  even
      with a low  degree  of  activity  might  still  come  to  the  adverse
      attention of the Iranian authorities.  Further, as was set out  within
      paragraph 457 of AB, the act of returning  someone  creates  a  'pinch
      point' so that returnees are brought  into  direct  contact  with  the
      authorities in  Iran  who  have  both  the  time  and  inclination  to
      interrogate them and that it is likely that they would be asked  about
      their internet activity and likely that  if  they  have  any  internet
      activity for that to be exposed and if that is less than flattering of
      the government to lead to a real risk of persecution.

  19.  Judge McIntosh's stated at [30] that "I have found that generally the
      Appellant's involvement with the organisation CEMB to be minimal,  his
      activities on social media  to  be  limited  and  therefore  in  those
      circumstances his profile will not be regarded as  prominent"  and  at
      [29] that "the Appellant's involvement with the  CEMB  as  an  atheist
      arose a considerable time after he left Iran.  I find there is nothing
      significant  in  the  Appellant's  conduct  to  attract  the   adverse
      attention of the Iranian authorities". However, these findings do  not
      properly and adequately explain how the Appellant would not be seen to
      be a person who falls within the 'pinch point' who is  being  returned
      to Iran and who would then be likely to be subject to  questioning  by
      the Iranian authorities and asked about his internet activity.   Judge
      McIntosh did not find that the Appellant was  not  involved  with  the
      Council of Ex-Muslims of  Britain  as  claimed  or  that  he  had  not
      publicly stated on the internet that he did not  believe  in  God  and
      that God does not exist as set out within [23]  of  the  Judgment,  or
      that the website link included a photograph of the Appellant.

  20.  The Judge appears to have concluded that  although  the  greater  the
      activity the greater the chance of adverse attention, that thereby the
      Appellant's involvement must be great and his profile must be regarded
      as prominent before he would be at risk upon return.  It is clear upon
      the close reading of AB and Others that is not what the Upper Tribunal
      was stating.  Quite the opposite.  It is possible for someone  with  a
      low profile to be at risk, but each case turns  upon  its  own  facts.
      However, the fact that Judge McIntosh appears to have  required  there
      to be a prominent profile before risk  could  be  established  without
      explaining why the Appellant would not fall within the 'pinch  point',
      does mean that his decision is inadequately reasoned in  this  regard,
      and it does appear that he has applied too high a test.   I  therefore
      do find that this amounts to a material error.  I do  not  accept  the
      submission made by Mr Duffy that any such  error  in  this  regard  is
      immaterial, given that it goes  specifically  to  the  risk  that  the
      Appellant might face upon return and the Judge's  assessment  of  that
      risk.  It cannot be said that the decision must  have  been  the  same
      irrespective of the Judge having misapplied what  the  Upper  Tribunal
      stated in AB and Others, in having  failed  to  deal  with  the  point
      regarding whether or not the Appellant will  fall  within  the  'pinch
      point' of people who would be asked by the Iranian  authorities  about
      their possible internet activity, and the fact that he  could  not  be
      expected to lie in respect thereof.

  21. Further, although Judge McIntosh at [32]  did  refer  to  the  Country
      Information Guidance at paragraph 5.1.6  referring  to  a  fine  being
      imposed for leaving Iran  illegally  and  how  Dr  Kakhki,  a  special
      advisor to the Centre for Criminal Law and Justice  and  Associate  of
      the Centre for Iranian Studies at Durham University had  stated  in  a
      general report on the risk of return dated the 5th December 2014  that
      "according  to  a  new  amendment  of  Article  34  of  Passport   Law
      (21/1/1020) any Iranian who leaves the country  illegally,  without  a
      valid passport or similar  travel  documents,  will  be  sentenced  to
      between one and three  years'  imprisonment,  or  receive  a  fine  of
      between 500,000 and 3,000,000 Tomans  (approximately  �108-�650)",  he
      has also not adequately explained why,  given  his  finding  that  the
      Appellant had left Iran  illegally,  that  he  would  thereby  not  be
      subjected to persecution for convention reasons upon return,  were  he
      to be imprisoned or risk imprisonment simply on the  Judge's  finding,
      upon return for having left Iran illegally.  However, given  the  fact
      that the country guidance case of SB (Risk on Return -  Illegal  Exit)
      Iran CG [2009] UKAIT 00053 held that illegal exiting per  se  did  not
      give rise to a real risk  of  persecution  upon  return,  the  Judge's
      failure to properly explain his findings in respect  of  the  risk  of
      imprisonment or fine for illegal exit and the effect  upon  risk  upon
      return, does not amount in such circumstances to a material error.

  22. However, for the reasons set out above, given that the Judge  has  not
      adequately explained his reasons as to why the Appellant would not  be
      at risk upon return as a result of his internet activity as an atheist
      and in having applied too high a  test,  the  decision  of  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge McIntosh does reveal a material error of law and is set
      aside in its entirety.  Given that the findings regarding  the  extent
      of the Appellant's activities as an atheist and consequently his  risk
      upon return will need  to  be  re-examined  in  its  entirety,  it  is
      appropriate for the  case  to  be  remitted  back  to  the  First-tier
      Tribunal for re-hearing de novo before any First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      other than First-tier Tribunal Judge McIntosh.

Notice of Decision

The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge McIntosh does  reveal  a  material
error of law and is set aside;

The case is remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal for  re-hearing  before
any  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  other  than  First-tier   Tribunal   Judge
McIntosh.

Deputy Judge of the Upper Tribunal McGinty                             Dated
23rd April 2016
