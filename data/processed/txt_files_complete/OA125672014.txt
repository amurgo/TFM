Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr E Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Faton Klimenti (sponsor)



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


    1. The Entry Clearance Officer (ECO) appeals the decision of  First-tier
       Tribunal Judge J S Law, promulgated on 21  April  2015,  allowing  an
       appeal against a decision to refuse the respondent leave to enter the
       United Kingdom as a partner.

  Background

    2. The respondent applied for leave to enter the United Kingdom  as  the
       partner of Faton Klimenti on 25 March 2013. A notification  dated  28
       November 2013 informed the respondent that her application fell to be
       refused because she did not meet the income threshold required  under
       Appendix FM and/or the evidential requirements under  Appendix  FM-SE
       were not met.  Consequently, her application had  been  put  on  hold
       pending the case of MM & Others.

    3. The said application was refused on 18 August 2014 under paragraph EC-
       P.1.1 because the sponsor  did  not  meet  the  income  threshold  of
       �18,600. It is noted that following the ECO's request for  additional
       information, the respondent sent 6 months worth of pay slips and bank
       statements. The total income shown on the pay  slips  was  �6,696.88,
       which equated  to  an  annual  income  of  �13,393.76.   It  was  not
       considered that there were any exceptional circumstances, which would
       warrant a grant of entry clearance outside the Rules.

    4. In appealing the ECO's decision, on 4 October  2014,  the  respondent
       indicated that she  understood  the  decision  to  refuse  given  the
       sponsor's  income  at  the  time   of   the   original   application.
       Nonetheless, it was said that the sponsor had  changed  his  employer
       since the decision and was now working for one employer for 40  hours
       per week at a rate of �7.90 per hour and for a second employer for 14
       hours per week at a rate of �6.31 per hour. This was said  to  amount
       to a total annual income of �21,025.68. Further documentary  evidence
       was enclosed including  pay  slips.  An  indication  was  given  that
       further documents would follow.

    5. An Entry Clearance Manager (ECM)  reviewed  the  decision  to  refuse
       entry  on  12  December  2014,  however  the  original  decision  was
       maintained. The ECM commented on the  additional  evidence  submitted
       with the appeal and noted that  the  sponsor's  employment  began  17
       months after the original application; that he had been  employed  in
       both these temporary jobs for around 4 months and it was unclear what
       his total annual income was. It was said that the  respondent  should
       apply again, providing the required evidence. A request was made that
       the tribunal not take  into  consideration  any  additional  evidence
       provided at the appeal, as such evidence could be used to  support  a
       fresh application.

    6. The respondent requested a paper hearing  of  her  appeal.  The  FTTJ
       allowed the appeal on the basis  that  the  evidence  before  him  of
       continuing employment showed that the Rules were met. The appeal  was
       also allowed on human rights grounds owing to the delay in the appeal
       being heard.

  Error of law

    7. The appeal was received on 28 May 2015, whereas the  FTTJ's  decision
       was promulgated on 21 April 2015. The application  conceded  that  it
       had been made 22 days out of  time  owing  to  "administrative  error
       resulting in the allocation of the case to a caseworker who  was  not
       experienced in this type of application."

    8. The single ground of challenge  was  that  the  FTTJ  had  materially
       misdirected himself  in  accepting  evidence,  which  post-dated  the
       application. While it was  accepted  that  the  FTTJ  might  look  at
       evidence up to the date of the  decision,  this  did  not  alter  the
       substance of the Rules, which required the income  to  have  been  in
       place for a period of twelve months, whereas  the  second  employment
       had been held for only four months. Reference was made to Appendix FM-
       SE 13. Criticism was also made of the FTTJ's decision  to  allow  the
       appeal  under  Article  8  ECHR,  absent  findings   of   exceptional
       circumstances.

    9. FTTJ Macdonald, who refused permission on 27 July 2015, did so on the
       basis  of  the  "unexplained"  and  "significant"  lateness  of   the
       application.

   10. Upper Tribunal Judge Kopieczek noted that FTTJ Macdonald had  refused
       the application as opposed  to  not  admitting  it.  Given  that  the
       application to the Upper Tribunal was in time, there was no basis  in
       the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  for  refusing  to
       admit the application to the Upper Tribunal where it has been refused
       under the First-tier Tribunal Rules rather than not  being  admitted.
       With regard to the grounds, it was said to be arguable that the  FTTJ
       erred in taking into account evidence, which post-dated the  date  of
       decision, both in relation to the Rules and Article 8 ECHR.

   11. This appeal was initially listed for a hearing on 18  December  2015.
       The sponsor did not attend and nor was  he  represented.  Instead,  a
       friend of the sponsor, Mr Hayes,  attended,  intending  to  represent
       him. As that friend was not legally qualified or registered with  the
       OISC, I adjourned the appeal in order for the sponsor  to  attend  on
       the next occasion.

   12. This matter came back before me  on  29  January  2016.  The  sponsor
       attended the hearing  along  with  Mr  Hayes.  After  explaining  the
       procedure to the sponsor, in English,  which  he  spoke  fluently,  I
       heard submissions from Mr Tufan and the sponsor, in turn.

   13. Mr Tufan argued, in simple terms  for  the  sponsor's  benefit,  that
       there was a requirement for specified  evidence  in  the  form  of  6
       months' pay slips, bank statements showing that pay and a letter from
       an employer to be submitted with the visa application. While the FTTJ
       had directed himself appropriately at [6] of  the  decision,  he  had
       erred in taking into account new  evidence  from  the  sponsor  of  a
       second, part-time job, in finding  that  the  financial  requirements
       were met. At [13] the FTTJ had noted a change of circumstances  since
       the application was made. Such compliance had to be shown at the time
       of the application. The remedy was for  a  fresh  application  to  be
       made. Mr Tufan's view was that were an application for  entry  to  be
       made now, the respondent would succeed.

   14. With regard to Article 8 ECHR, Mr Tufan, relied  on  SS  (Congo)  and
       submitted that the FTTJ identified no compelling circumstances  which
       justified the respondent being granted entry  clearance  outside  the
       Immigration Rules.

   15. Mr Klimenti told me that at the  time  of  the  application  for  his
       wife's entry to the United Kingdom he was earning  the  minimum  wage
       and that his  income  was  well  below  the  figure  of  �18,600.  In
       September 2014, they received  the  ECO's  refusal  decision  and  he
       subsequently found two new jobs. Currently, he had only one job which
       paid him around �19,000 a year and he had sent evidence of his latest
       earnings to the Upper Tribunal after learning of the ECO's appeal.

   16. I invited Mr Klimenti to tell me of any reasons why  he  thought  his
       wife ought to be granted entry clearance  if  the  Immigration  Rules
       were not met. He explained that it had been  hard  for  him  to  find
       employment, which paid the �18,600 required. He had been working  for
       the minimum wage for a long time. He was of the view that the minimum
       income threshold was unfair. If his wife was allowed to come  to  the
       United Kingdom she could work as well. It was hard for him with  only
       one person working. The visa application fee was too high as well and
       for this reason he did not want to have to apply again.  He  stressed
       that he had lived in the United Kingdom for 24  years,  paying  taxes
       throughout.

  Decision on error of law

   17. After hearing submissions, I announced that I had  found  a  material
       error of law in the FTTJ's decision. The FTTJ recognized  at  [6]  of
       the decision and reasons that he was constrained by  Section  85A  of
       the 2002 Act and might only consider  circumstances  appertaining  at
       the date of the decision. However, at [11], the FTTJ notes that there
       "was now evidence that his  employment  had  changed...  evidence  of
       these employments were produced in the bundle and  were  relied  upon
       for their appeal." The FTTJ relies on the fact that the ECM commented
       on this new evidence of employment in  the  review.  However,  it  is
       clear from the review, that the ECM has not  accepted  that  the  new
       employment evidence is capable of satisfying the Rules at the date of
       the application, in that the following is said "I would note that the
       sponsors' current employment  began  17  months  after  the  original
       application" and that he had been so employed for only  4  months  at
       the time of the ECM's review.  Furthermore  Appendix  FM-SE  requires
       proof of income to be provided for a period of twelve  months,  where
       the employment has lasted less than six months prior to the  date  of
       application. Evidence of 12 months income, prior to the  application,
       decision or review was not before the ECO/ECM.  Accordingly, the FTTJ
       erred in finding that the requirements of the Rules were  met  either
       at the date of application, the decision or the ECM's review.

   18. In a short paragraph, [14], the FTTJ also allowed  the  appeal  under
       Article 8 ECHR, mentioning the delay, which had enabled  the  sponsor
       to meet the minimum income requirements.  As  indicated  above,  that
       income level was reached  only  after  the  ECO's  decision  but  the
       requirements of Appendix FM-SE were not met.  The FTTJ did not  carry
       out an adequate proportionality assessment or identify any compelling
       circumstances justifying allowing the appeal on this basis.

   19. The decision of the FTTJ is therefore set aside.

  Decision on remaking

   20. I decided to immediately remake the  decision,  however  neither  the
       sponsor nor Mr Tufan had much more to say by way of submissions.

   21. The sponsor accepted that between the date of application  and  ECO's
       decision, he was unable to meet the minimum income threshold. It  was
       only after the decision was made that he was able to obtain  two  new
       sources of income, which combined to give him a high  enough  income,
       averaged out over the following year, that  is  from  September  2014
       until September 2015. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed under  the
       Immigration Rules.

   22. With regard to Article 8 ECHR, I have had regard to what was said  in
       SS (Congo) & Ors at [32];

           "Accordingly, a court or tribunal is required to  give  the  new
           Rules "greater weight than as merely as a starting point for the
           consideration of the proportionality  of  an  interference  with
           Article 8 rights."

   23. In addition, in view of the sponsor's submission on the unfairness of
       the Rules, I have considered what was held in MM v others  at  [151],
       as follows;

           "... the Secretary of State's judgment cannot be  impugned.  She
           has discharged the burden of demonstrating that the interference
           was both the  minimum  necessary  and  strikes  a  fair  balance
           between the interests of the groups concerned and the  community
           in general.  Individuals  will  have  different  views  on  what
           constitutes the minimum income requirements needed to accomplish
           the stated policy aims. In my judgment it is not the court's job
           to impose its own view unless, objectively  judged,  the  levels
           chosen are to be  characterised  as  irrational,  or  inherently
           unjust or inherently unfair. In my view they cannot be. "

   24. Given the delay in this case, I therefore consider  the  respondent's
       human rights claim in line with the test  in  Razgar.  Clearly,  they
       have established a family life. The respondent's decision does amount
       to interference in the proposed family life being carried out in  the
       United Kingdom. I accept that it is  not  reasonable  to  expect  the
       sponsor to relocate to Kosovo, when he  has  resided  in  the  United
       Kingdom for 24 years  and  is  working  hard  to  support  his  wife.
       Consequently the only realistic venue for this family to be  reunited
       is the United Kingdom. It is not in question that the ECO's  decision
       was in accordance with the law. I also find that it was necessary, in
       that the interference was in pursuit of one of  the  legitimate  aims
       set out in Article 8(2).

   25. In determining the proportionality of the ECO's decision, I have  had
       regard to the public interest considerations set out in section  117B
       of the 2002 Act. In terms of section 117B(1), I have attached  weight
       to the fact that the respondent could not meet  the  requirements  of
       the Rules at the relevant time in considering that the maintenance of
       effective  immigration  controls  is  in  the  public  interest.  The
       appellant has produced  an  English  language  certificate  with  her
       application and therefore I accept that she is able to speak English.



   26. With regard  to  financial  independence  in  (3),  I  have  attached
       significant weight to the fact that the financial requirements of the
       Rules were not met at the time of the application, decision or  ECM's
       review.

   27. In MM & Ors it was held that "appropriate weight had to be  given  to
       the judgment of the Secretary of State" in relation to the  level  of
       the income requirements.

   28. The respondent has applied to come to the United Kingdom in order  to
       take up family life. The family life which was established  following
       the marriage took place  at  a  time  when  it  was  known  that  the
       respondent did  not  have  a  right  to  come  here,  that  is  under
       conditions of "known precariousness" as said in [37] of SS (Congo)  &
       Ors. The sponsor would also have been aware that, while  earning  the
       minimum wage he was not in a position to maintain the  respondent.  I
       take into consideration the fact that Article 8 does  not  confer  an
       automatic right of entry and that the said Article imposes no general
       obligation on a state to facilitate the choice made by  a  couple  to
       reside in it. I accept that family life  could  not  reasonably  take
       place elsewhere owing to the sponsor's employment, however  the  fact
       that family life involving the respondent could not realistically  be
       carried out elsewhere does not entitle her to  be  granted  leave  to
       enter the United Kingdom.

   29. Considering all the  relevant  issues,  I  do  not  accept  that  the
       interests of the parties in this case are of such a  pressing  nature
       that a good claim for leave to enter can be established  outside  the
       Rules.

   30. I therefore consider that the obstacles to the family being  reunited
       in the United Kingdom amount to no more than mere difficulties  which
       resulted from their choice to marry at a time when the sponsor  could
       not financially  maintain  the  respondent  in  accordance  with  the
       Immigration Rules. I therefore conclude that the refusal of entry  to
       the appellant was not a disproportionate decision.

   31. The decision of the FTTJ is  set  aside  and  I  substitute  a  fresh
       decision to dismiss the appeal against the refusal of her application
       under Appendix FM and on human rights grounds.

  Decision


    1) The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the
       making of an error on a point of law

    2) The decision of the FTTJ to allow the appeal is set aside.

    3) I substitute a fresh decision  to  dismiss  the  respondent's  appeal
       against the refusal of her application for  entry  clearance  to  the
       United Kingdom as a partner both under  Appendix  FM  and  Article  8
       ECHR.

  No application for anonymity was made and I could see no reason  to  make
  such a direction.
