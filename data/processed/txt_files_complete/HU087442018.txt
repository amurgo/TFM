                          DECISION ON ERROR OF LAW

Introduction

1.    The Appellant is a national of the Philippines who applied as a child
    (two days before her 18th birthday) for entry clearance to join her
    sponsor and mother in the UK. That application was refused for reasons
    given in a letter dated 21 March 2018. The refusal letter is
    incomplete. Neither party was able to furnish the Tribunal with a
    complete copy and it does not appear that this was identified and made
    available to the First-tier Tribunal. What is clear from the refusal
    however, is that it was the Respondent's view that there was
    insufficient evidence to establish that the sponsor had sole
    responsibility for the Appellant and whilst, in the alternative, the
    Respondent concluded that there were no serious and compelling
    considerations that made the Appellant's exclusion from the UK
    undesirable the reasons for that are incomplete. The Respondent's
    review of its decision taken on 22 November 2018 is not informative of
    those reasons.

2.    The Appellant's appeal against the refusal was heard by First-tier
    Tribunal Judge S J Walker ("the judge"), who in a decision promulgated
    on 2 May 2019 dismissed the appeal. The judge gave a comprehensive
    analysis of the evidence and rejected it for the reasons set out at
    [27] to [80].

3.    The Appellant's application for permission to appeal was granted by
    First-tier Tribunal Judge P J M Hollingworth on 13 June 2019. The grant
    is prolix and given in a closely typed lengthy paragraph and thus is
    not easy to follow. While Mr Kotas provided the Tribunal with a copy of
    its decision in Durueke (PTA:AZ applied, proper approach) [2019] UKUT
    197 (IAC) (a decision which concerned the same judge) he did not refer
    to it and following a discussion with the representatives there was no
    dispute that the grant notwithstanding its wordiness did reflect the
    grounds in this case.

 4.         The Respondent did not reply to that grant with a Rule 24
    response.

The Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

5.    The judge heard evidence from the sponsor and a witness. The judge
    accepted that the Appellant's father had had no involvement with her
    upbringing since 2004 and that she had not lived with the sponsor since
    2005. The Appellant was living with her grandparents and her
    grandmother was appointed as her legal guardian. It was the Appellant's
    case that her grandmother was in a fragile condition and could no
    longer care for her in addition to her younger sister. The judge
    considered the evidence and noted various inconsistencies and omissions
    and found that the state of the grandmother's health had been
    exaggerated. The judge proceeded to consider the Appellant's personal
    and domestic circumstances and concluded that she had failed to
    establish that the Rules were met and found that the refusal of entry
    clearance was proportionate.

Discussion

6.    I have considered the submissions of the representatives and the
    authority of WN (Surendran; credibility; new evidence) Democratic
    Republic of Congo [2004] UKIAT 00213 relied upon by Mr Kotas at the
    hearing.

7.    Mr Kotas made a valiant attempt to defend this decision and, whilst I
    acknowledge that the judge gave a number of reasons for rejecting the
    evidence and nor is he required to conduct a forensic analysis of it,
    there is a particular ground in my judgement that establishes in its
    own right that the approach adopted by the judge led to unfairness with
    potentially serious consequences for the Appellant.

8.    It is necessary first to look at the Respondent's (incomplete)
    refusal letter and the position he adopted at the hearing. I agree with
    Miss Dogra that the refusal letter does not challenge the credibility
    of the sponsor insofar as it is not suggested that she was dishonest or
    incredible and nor was the reliability of the documentary evidence
    challenged therein. The crux of the Respondent's refusal was that
    insufficient evidence had been provided by the Appellant to establish
    her case. By the time of the hearing a substantial volume of
    documentation had been filed in support of the appeal which included a
    certificate of residency confirming the Appellant's grandmother had
    been appointed as her legal guardian and the Appellant's
    school/university identity cards that named the sponsor as an emergency
    point of contact. It does not appear that this evidence was submitted
    to the Respondent on application. The judge summarised the Respondent's
    case at the hearing at [20] to [21]. Essentially, his case was that
    responsibility was shared between the sponsor and her mother. It was
    not alleged by the Respondent that the sponsor was dishonest or that
    the documentation relied upon was unreliable.

9.    The judge however did take issue with this documentation and found
    the evidence was wanting in several respects. The judge stated thus:

         "49.     At paragraph 22 of her witness statement the sponsor says
         that the Appellant was enrolled in class 12 SY at Sunny Hillside
         School for the 2017-2018 academic year [~]. At paragraph 15 of the
         Appellant's witness statement she says that the sponsor is the main
         person for her school to call in case of an emergency [~].

         50.      At page 101 there is a (sic) what appears to be a school
         identity card for the Appellant. This states that her
         parent/guardian and the person to be called in an emergency is the
         sponsor. The card shows that the Appellant is in grade 12 so I take
         it that it was issued for the 2017/ 2018 year as this is consistent
         with what is said in the sponsor's statement.

         51.      On the face of it the document at 101 suggests that the
         sponsor was the emergency contact for the Appellant from the
         beginning of that school year.

         52. Similarly, the Appellant has provided a copy of an identity
         card which shows that she is studying at the Polytechnic University
         of the Philippines for the 2018/2019 academic year. It states that
         the card was issued on 5 July 2018. This card also shows that in
         case of emergency the sponsor is to be notified.

         ...

         54.      ... On 11 October 2018 the Appellant sent images of a
         student and school identity cards which appeared to be identical to
         those relied on [~]. However, close inspection reveals one
         significant difference in both cases. Both cards state that in case
         of emergency contact is to be made with the sponsor's mother, not
         the sponsor. Then, on the 29 November 2018 the Appellant sent
         images of the same two cards now in the form that they appear in at
         pages 99 and 101."

10.   The judge was clearly of the view that this was damning evidence and
    made an adverse credibility finding in respect of the Appellant and
    sponsor concluding that they had altered and fabricated evidence at
    [55] & [56]. This adverse finding plainly had an impact on the judge's
    view of other evidence said to emanate from the Appellant's school at
    [57], [59] & [70].

11.   These findings are central to the Appellant's formulation of
    complaint of unfairness. Essentially Miss Dogra submits that the judge
    should have given the sponsor an opportunity to address this issue and
    not to do so caused unfairness. Mr Kotas submits that the judge was not
    obliged to do so as credibility was in issue and it was for the
    Appellant to prove her case. I prefer the submissions of Miss Dogra on
    this point. It is clear from the authority of WN (supra) that it is not
    necessary for obvious points on credibility to be put, where
    credibility is generally in issue in light of the refusal letter or as
    a result of later evidence, but conversely where the point is important
    to the decision but not obvious or where the issue of credibility has
    not been raised or does not obviously arise on new material it is
    generally better for the judge to raise the point if not otherwise
    raised. The Tribunal in WN at ï¿½ 40 further held that there was no hard
    and fast rule but "it is a question in each case for a judgement as to
    what is fair and properly perceived as fair."

12.   Whilst I take account of the submission of Mr Kotas that credibility
    is a broad issue, in my judgement, the Respondent's case did not attack
    the credibility of the Appellant or her sponsor either in the refusal
    letter or at the hearing. The allegation of tampering with the evidence
    was thus not a matter that was raised by the Respondent, but it became
    a concern of the judge either at the hearing or during his
    deliberations. It is in my judgement that, at the very least, this
    concern should have been identified and put to the sponsor to allow her
    an opportunity to address it. To allow her to do so was significant in
    this case as the finding against the Appellant in particular of
    fabricating evidence and thus of being dishonest could, as Miss Dogra
    pointed out, have serious consequences should the Appellant seek entry
    to the UK for any other purpose in the future by the application of
    paragraph 320(7B) of the Rules. Mr Kotas did not contend that that
    would not be a possibility in this case.

13.   In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the Appellant has made out
    her case of procedural unfairness, and the only proper course is to set
    aside the decision and remit the appeal for a hearing afresh.

Direction

The Respondent is to file and serve a complete copy if its refusal letter
of 21 March 2018 on the First-tier Tribunal and the Appellant within 21
days following receipt of this Decision. Any other directions for the
rehearing will be issued by the First-tier Tribunal in accordance with its
case management powers.





Notice of Decision

The decision did involve the making of an error of law sufficient for it to
be set aside and reheard de novo by the First-tier Tribunal (Taylor House)
by a judge other than Judge S J Walker.
