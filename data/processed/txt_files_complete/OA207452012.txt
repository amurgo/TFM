                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


Introduction and Background

 1. The Respondent before the Upper Tribunal was the Appellant  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal.  I will refer to her as the Claimant.

 2. The Entry Clearance Officer (ECO) appeals against  a  determination  of
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal S J Pacey (the judge)  promulgated  on
    24th March 2014.

 3. The Claimant is a female citizen of Bangladesh born 8th August 1986 who
    applied for entry clearance to the United  Kingdom  to  enable  her  to
    settle as the spouse of Mohammed Kobirul Islam  (the  Sponsor)  who  is
    settled in the United Kingdom.

 4.  The  application  was  refused  on  2nd  October  2012.   Because  the
    application had been made prior to the  amendment  of  the  Immigration
    Rules on 9th July 2012, the application was considered  with  reference
    to paragraph 281 of the Immigration Rules.

 5. The  ECO  did  not  accept  that  it  had  been  proved  that  adequate
    accommodation or maintenance would be available for the  Appellant  and
    the application was  therefore  refused  with  reference  to  paragraph
    281(iv) and (v).  The ECO considered that refusal  of  entry  clearance
    would not breach Article 8 of the 1950  European  Convention  on  Human
    Rights (the 1950 Convention).

 6. The Claimant  appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  contending  that
    adequate accommodation and maintenance would be available.   There  was
    no appeal pursuant to Article 8.

 7. The application was reviewed by the Entry Clearance  Manager  (ECM)  in
    the light of the appeal.  The decision to  refuse  entry  clearance  on
    accommodation and maintenance grounds was upheld.  The ECM raised a new
    issue,  not  being  satisfied  that  the  Claimant's  English  language
    certificates were valid, as a result of inconsistencies that  had  been
    discovered in testing in Bangladesh.

 8. The appeal was heard by Judge Pacey (the judge) on 3rd March 2014.  The
    judge found that the Claimant had discharged the  burden  of  proof  in
    showing that adequate accommodation and maintenance would be available.
     The judge found that the ECO had provided no evidence  to  demonstrate
    that the Claimant's English language certificates could not  be  relied
    upon.  The appeal was allowed under the Immigration Rules.

 9. The ECO applied for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.  It was
    contended that the judge had erred in paragraph 4 of the  determination
    by making reference to the Sponsor's gross earnings being sufficient to
    provide adequate maintenance, as it was  the  net  earnings  that  were
    relevant.

10. It was contended that the judge had erred in  paragraph  5  in  stating
    that additional independent corroborating evidence had been provided to
    support the Sponsor's employment and stated income, but the  judge  had
    given no indication as to what evidence had been provided.

11. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Grant who found it arguable that the judge had erred  in  referring  to
    gross income rather than net income, and in  failing  to  set  out  the
    nature of the evidence which had been provided, and without setting out
    his evaluation of that evidence.

12. Following the  grant  of  permission,  the  Claimant's  representatives
    lodged a response pursuant to rule 24 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper
    Tribunal) Rules 2008 indicating that they did not oppose the ground  of
    appeal upon which permission was granted, and accepted that  the  judge
    had erred in making reference to the Sponsor's  gross  earnings  rather
    than his net earnings.

13. Directions were issued that there should be an oral hearing before  the
    Upper  Tribunal  to  ascertain  whether   the   First-tier   Tribunal's
    determination contained an error of law such  that  it  should  be  set
    aside.

The Upper Tribunal Hearing

Error of Law

14. Mr Singh agreed that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  contained
    a material error of law and should be set aside, and the  decision  re-
    made by the Upper Tribunal.

15. I did not need to hear from Mr Smart in relation to the  error  of  law
    issue.  I set aside the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  the
    reasons given  in  the  application  for  permission  to  appeal,  read
    together with the grant of permission.   It  was  not  clear  from  the
    determination that the judge had considered the Sponsor's net earnings,
    which  were  the  relevant  earnings,  nor  what  evidence   had   been
    considered.

16. There had been no challenge to  the  findings  made  by  the  judge  in
    relation to accommodation, and English language and those findings were
    preserved.

Remaking the Decision

17. Mr Singh indicated that he did not intend to call any further evidence.
     Mr Singh placed reliance upon the Sponsor's P60 tax form for the  year
    ending 5th April 2013 which he contended showed that the Sponsor had  a
    net weekly wage of �219.70.

18. Mr Singh deducted from that amount, the Sponsor's rent of �70 per week,
    and his council tax payment of �25.25 per week which gave a  figure  of
    �124.45.  This exceeded what a couple would receive by  way  of  income
    support, which was �111.45 per week.  On that basis Mr Singh  submitted
    that adequate maintenance  was  available  and  the  appeal  should  be
    allowed.

19. Mr Smart did not dispute  Mr  Singh's  calculations  and  had  no  oral
    submissions to make, save to  point  out  that  the  evidence  on  file
    indicated that the Sponsor had two children from  a  previous  marriage
    and there was no evidence as to whether he had to  financially  support
    them.

20. I reserved my decision.

My Conclusions and Reasons

21. I remind myself that in relation to paragraph 281 the burden  of  proof
    is  on  the  Claimant  and  the  standard  of  proof   a   balance   of
    probabilities.  As this is an appeal from a refusal of entry clearance,
    I must consider the circumstances appertaining at the date of  refusal,
    which was 2nd October 2012.

22. The only issue before me relates to adequacy of maintenance.   This  is
    not an appeal in which Article  8  was  raised  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  There has been no challenge to the findings  of  the  First-
    tier  Tribunal  in  relation  to  accommodation  and  English  language
    ability.

23. As  this  was  an  application  considered  under  paragraph  281,  the
    principles to be considered in relation to adequacy of maintenance  are
    those set out in KA  and  Others  (Adequacy  of  maintenance)  Pakistan
    [2006] UKAIT 00065.  The requirement of  adequacy  is  objective.   The
    level of income and other benefits  that  would  be  available  if  the
    family were drawing income support remains the yardstick.

24. The Claimant and Sponsor must therefore prove they have an income,  net
    of accommodation costs, equivalent to  what  a  couple  in  receipt  of
    income support would have received.

25. There is no evidence that the Sponsor has any financial  responsibility
    for two children from his previous marriage.  The fact that he has  two
    children was disclosed to the ECO, there is evidence of this in the ECO
    bundle.  There is a certificate issued by  Oldham  County  Court  dated
    11th July 2006 which confirms the names  and  dates  of  birth  of  the
    Sponsor's two daughters.  There is no indication that the county  court
    made any order for payment of maintenance.  This is not an  issue  that
    was raised either in the refusal, or the  ECM  review,  or  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal.  I therefore find the Sponsor and  Claimant,  must
    prove they have a net weekly income equivalent  to  what  a  couple  in
    receipt of income support would have received, and that amount  at  the
    relevant time was �111.45.

26. The Sponsor's P60 for the tax year ending 5th April 2013 was  contained
    at page 4 of the Claimant's  bundle  that  was  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  This shows the Sponsor's gross  annual  salary  as  �13,004,
    with deductions from that amount of �947.60 for tax,  and  �631.76  for
    national insurance contributions.

27. The Sponsor's net annual income was therefore �11,424.64.  This gives a
    net weekly income of �219.70.

28. The Sponsor had to pay rent of �70 per week.  The evidence of  this  is
    contained in the ECO bundle, which is not indexed or  paginated,  which
    shows the Sponsor's rent book and confirms  that  his  rental  payments
    were �70 per week.

29. The Sponsor's council tax must also be deducted.  Mr  Singh  calculated
    this at �101 per month then divided that by four to give  a  figure  of
    �25.25 per week.  In my view the appropriate calculation is to take the
    annual charge for the twelve  month  period  which  was  �1,013.11  and
    divide this by 52  which  gives  �19.48.   The  council  tax  bill  for
    2012/2013 is contained within the ECO bundle.

30. If the council tax payment of �19.48 is added to the rent of �70,  this
    gives a figure of �89.48 which if deducted from �219.70 gives a  figure
    of �130.22.

31. This is the Sponsor's weekly income after payment of  council  tax  and
    rent, and as this exceeds the sum of �111.45 income support which would
    be paid to a couple, I conclude that it has been proved  that  adequate
    maintenance would be available.

32. As that was the only issue before me I find that the Claimant's  appeal
    succeeds, and the appeal of the ECO is dismissed.

Decision

The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contained an error of  law  and
was set aside.

I substitute a fresh decision.

The appeal of the ECO is dismissed.  The Claimant's appeal is allowed  under
the Immigration Rules.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal made no anonymity  direction.   There  has  been  no
request for anonymity and the Upper Tribunal makes no anonymity order.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As the Claimant's appeal is allowed I have considered whether to make a  fee
award.  Evidence has been provided to  the  Tribunal  that  was  not  placed
before the ECO.  There is therefore no fee award.
