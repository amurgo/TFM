     DECISION PURSUANT TO RULE 40(3)(a) OF THE TRIBUNAL PROCEDURE (UPPER
                            TRIBUNAL) RULES 2008


 1. The appellant is a citizen of India.  He  appealed  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal ("FtT) against a decision dated 29 June 2015 to  refuse  leave
    to remain as a partner (of a  British  Citizen),  and  his  appeal  was
    allowed.

 2. After a hearing before me on 9 August 2017, I set aside the decision of
    the FtT for error of law and the appeal was listed for the re-making of
    the decision.

 3. The appellant and his British Citizen partner now have a child, born on
    [ ] 2017. In the light of that fact, and the  particular  circumstances
    of this appeal, it was conceded on behalf of the  respondent  that  the
    appeal should be allowed  on  Article  8  grounds,  with  reference  to
    Appendix FM of  the  Immigration  Rules,  with  specific  reference  to
    section EX.1, and on behalf of the appellant that course was agreed.

 4. Accordingly, I allow the appeal on Article 8 grounds. Pursuant to  rule
    40(3)(a) of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008,  no
    reasons (or further reasons) are required, the decision being made with
    the consent of the parties.
