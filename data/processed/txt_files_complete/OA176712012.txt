Representation:

For the Appellant:     Miss G Vencatachellum, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a citizen of Jamaica, born on  5  January  1991.   She
    seeks entry clearance as a spouse under paragraph 281 of HC 395.

2.   The      Entry Clearance Officer refused that application on 14  August
    2012, essentially on  the  basis  that  there  was  not  a  genuine  or
    subsisting marriage.  It was a refusal  also  on  the  basis  that  the
    proposed third party support from a Mr  Madourie  was  insufficient  to
    satisfy the Rules as to maintenance.

3.   The appellant sought to appeal  against  that  decision,  which  appeal
    came before First-tier Tribunal Judge  Astle  on  8  April  2013.   The
    appeal was dismissed both in respect of the Immigration Rules and  also
    in respect of Article 8 of the ECHR.

4.   Leave to appeal was granted against that decision.   Thus,  the  matter
    comes before me in pursuance of that grant.

5.   There has  been  presented  for  my  attention  a  detailed  bundle  of
    documents that were before the First-tier Tribunal Judge.

6.   The Judge, having considered the evidence, found that the marriage  was
    indeed genuine  and  subsisting.   She  concluded,  however,  that  the
    proposed  funds  from  Mr  Madourie  were  inadequate  to  satisfy  the
    Immigration Rules.

7.    Complaint  is  made  by  Miss  Vencatachellum,  who   represents   the
    appellant, that the Judge was unduly narrow  in  her  approach  to  the
    finances and had failed to take into account that  there  was  a  joint
    account between Mr Madourie and his  partner  which  would  have  given
    sufficient funds to enable third party support to  have  continued  for
    the foreseeable future, and  certainly  for  the  two  years  that  was
    envisaged.  It is also said that the Judge failed to take into  account
    that Mr Madourie also had money available from his  earnings  and  also
    that the sponsor would be able to find employment.

8.   Contrary to such an argument, I find  that  the  Judge  has  borne  all
    relevant matters in mind.

9.   She has noted that the appellant had two accounts of his own  amounting
    to �825.37 and �284.35.  It is also clear  from  paragraph  22  of  the
    determination that the Judge recognised that the third account with the
    largest balance is that maintained by Santander in joint names.

10.  Shirley Taylor, in  her  statement  of  26  March  2013,  indicated  at
    paragraph 7 as follows:-

         "If my husband wants to support Anita he can do so with his savings
         as our work brings in the capital we need to run our household".


     The Judge was therefore not satisfied, in the absence  of  any  express
    consent by Shirley Taylor to the use of the joint  account,  that  that
    account should be taken into consideration.

11.  Miss Vencatachelum submitted that that was an  unduly  narrow  approach
    to take in relation to joint accounts.  Subsequent to the hearing  Miss
    Taylor has agreed to the use of the joint  account.   It  is  submitted
    that the whole function of having a joint account is that either  party
    could use it for their own purposes.

12.  I do not agree with that interpretation.  The whole purpose of a  joint
    account is that the parties can use it for their own or joint  purposes
    linked clearly with their personal situation and circumstances.   There
    is no reason to suppose that support for a third party, particularly if
    such were to drain the  account  substantially,  would  necessarily  be
    within the ambit of the implied  consent.   I  do  not  find  that  the
    approach taken by the Judge is in error in that regard.

13.  It is clear that the  Judge  has  analysed  matters  with  great  care,
    noticing that the weekly shortfall is �15.10, meaning that �785.20  per
    annum is required to make up the shortfall.

14.  It is clear from paragraph 21 that the Judge sought  to  reconcile  the
    earnings of Mr Madourie and had some difficulty in doing so.  Again, it
    is suggested that the Judge failed to bear in mind the earnings of Miss
    Taylor but it is apparent, as I so find from  paragraph  21,  that  the
    Judge had borne such matters in mind.

15.  It is clear from the statements that had  been  presented,  that  there
    was a degree of tension as to what indeed was left over from the day-to-
    day earnings of the third party sponsor as opposed to his savings.   In
    his own statement Harry Madourie indicated that he was financially able
    to support the appellant using his own earnings and his savings whereas
    in the statement of Shirley Taylor she indicates that he  could  do  so
    with his savings "as our work brings in the capital we need to run  the
    household".

16.  In cases such as this it is always of assistance  to  have  a  detailed
    schedule of earnings and expenditure to enable  the  Judge  to  have  a
    clear indication as to what surplus is available on a weekly or monthly
    basis.  That has not been done.  It is clear that the Judge has sought,
    with some care  in  paragraph  21,  to  obtain  that  result  including
    essentially that Mr Madourie's average income was �300 a month that  he
    could cover his expenses and  those  of  his  partner  from  such  sums
    together with hers.  To what extent there is a  surplus  has  not  been
    outlined in the course of the appeal.  The burden of course  does  fall
    upon the appellant  and  sponsor  to  establish  that  matter.   It  is
    unreasonable to criticise the Judge who has, as I  so  find,  done  her
    best to come to a fair conclusion.

17.  There is a curiosity in the bundle  of  documents  that  was  presented
    before the Judge in the form of a current bank statement  at  Santander
    in the name of Mr Madourie for the period 19 February 2013 to 18  March
    2013.  That shows  a  healthy  balance  whether  that  is  postdecision
    evidence is not clear but in any event that account statement  does not
    indicate what funds in that particular account were available prior  to
    the decision and indeed that account  does not feature in  the  grounds
    of appeal at all.  The only significant bank statement relied  upon  is
    that of the joint bank statement to which reference has been made.

18.  It is to be recognised in fairness to the appellant that the  shortfall
    could be made up from the undisputed accounts which  Mr  Madourie  has.
    The difference  is  not  substantial.   Nevertheless,  it  is  for  the
    appellant, through  her  representatives  in  the  preparation  of  the
    appeal, to adduce clear evidence as to what  funds  are  available  and
    this was not done.

19.  The purpose of an appeal is to determine whether  the  Judge  acted  in
    error of law not to invite me to embark upon the exercise of  merit  or
    to consider whether, in the light of circumstances, the  shortfall  has
    been covered.  As indicated, the Judge has been careful to do what  she
    can to arrive at figures and I do not find that  she  has  been  unduly
    narrow or unreasonable in the approach  which  she  has  taken  to  the
    matter.

20.  It is also contended that the Judge erred in the approach to Article  8
    in that a full balancing exercise was not entered upon in  relation  to
    the sponsor and appellant.  The sponsor is a British  citizen  who  has
    ill-health and it is contended that it was unreasonable of the Judge to
    consider the aspect of proportionality otherwise than to be resolved in
    favour of the appellant coming to the United Kingdom.  I do not  agree.
    In the findings  of  the  Judge  the  appellant  did  not  satisfy  the
    Immigration Rules,  albeit  by  a  small  margin.   There  has  been  a
    consistent application of the law but near-miss, although a factor,  is
    not a decisive factor in Article 8 cases.  The sponsor has  a  home  in
    Jamaica and a family.  There is no evidence that  seems  to  have  been
    presented to indicate that he would not obtain any necessary  treatment
    for his condition in Jamaica.

21.  The Judge highlighted the fact that perhaps better evidence was  needed
    in order to make a better and more holistic assessment  of  Article  8.
    With those comments I entirely agree.  The statements of the  appellant
    and the sponsor do not condescend upon the particulars  as  to  private
    and family life.  There are elements, particularly in the statement  of
    the sponsor, which indicate that he has extended family in  the  United
    Kingdom and, accordingly, it may be unreasonable for him  to  relocate.
    It may be that the approach taken by the Judge was somewhat  brief  but
    it was in the circumstances that the Judge did not consider  there  was
    sufficient material to further the application.

22.  I can detect no error of law in the approach taken by the Judge  either
    to the Immigration Rules or to Article 8.

23.  It is clear that the appellant has been successful as to a  significant
    aspect of her claim, namely that it is the intention of the parties  to
    live together.

  24. Accordingly, I do not find  there  to  be  an  error  of  law  in  the
      determination.  The proper course it seems to  me  is  for  a  further
      application to be made.  However, in the current situation of finance,
      particularly the agreement to the  use  of  the  funds,  that  perhaps
      should not pose too much of a difficulty.  Clearly what has to be made
      clear is that Mr Madourie is, from his earnings and savings,  able  to
      lend that degree of support over the two years as well as managing his
      own affairs.  To that  extent,  a  budget  would  be  helpful  and  of
      assistance to the decision maker.


  25. However for the present appeal I can detect no material error  of  law
      in the decision.
      The findings shall stand. The Appeal in  respect  of  the  Immigration
      Decision is dismissed as is the appeal in respect of Article 8 .
