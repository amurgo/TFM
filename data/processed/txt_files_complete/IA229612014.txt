                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Pacey, promulgated on 25th March 2015,  following  a  hearing  at
    Birmingham, Sheldon Court on 16th March 2015.   In  the  determination,
    the judge allowed the  appeal  of  Mrs  Rajpreet  Kaur,  whereupon  the
    Respondent Secretary  of  State,  subsequently  applied  for,  and  was
    granted, permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal,  and  thus  the
    matter comes before me.

The Appellant's Claim

 2. The Appellant's claim is that she is the primary carer of  Meher  Singh
    Bal, her son, who is a British son, and whose date  of  birth  is  26th
    August 2011, and she herself came to the UK on 14th  January  2005,  as
    the fiancï¿½e of a man whom she did not marry, because  she  subsequently
    married Mr Surjit Singh, Meher's father, on 3rd August 2011, after  her
    initial appeal had expired on 18th January 2008.  Her divorce from  her
    first husband was made absolute on 5th March 2008.  However, given that
    she is an overstayer now, as she would have to leave the  UK,  but  for
    the fact that if she were to leave then Meher Singh Bal, her son, would
    also have to leave, because Mr Surjit Singh, his father, could not care
    for him.  Mr Singh has a  permanent  right  of  residence  in  the  UK.
    Reliance was also placed upon the Appellant's Article 8 rights  and  on
    Section 55 of the 2009 Act in relation to the  best  interests  of  the
    child, Meher Singh Bal.

The Judge's Findings

 3. The judge observed how at the hearing the Appellant reaffirmed that she
    was Meher's primary carer and that her husband did  not  share  in  the
    responsibility of  Meher  (see  paragraph  13).   The  judge  correctly
    identifies the issues before her.  These were twofold.  First,  whether
    in accordance with Regulation  15A(4A),  it  could  be  said  that  the
    Appellant was "the primary carer of a British citizen";  and  secondly,
    whether it could be said that Meher Singh would be unable to reside  in
    the UK or another EEA state if the Appellant, her mother  with  primary
    care, was required to leave (see paragraph 4A(c)).

 4. The judge noted the evidence that Mr Singh worked  on  a  self-employed
    basis and spent a large part of the week working away  to  provide  for
    the family (see paragraph 22).  The judge concluded that,

         "I note that Mr Singh works away from home for a considerable  part
         of the week and so Meher would have to be left 24 hours in the  day
         in the care of someone who is not his parent.  Moreover, Mr Singh's
         work takes him both to London and the West Midlands so it would not
         be possible for him to relocate to be nearer  his  work  and  hence
         able to be with Meher each day, or at least each evening  as  would
         be the case if his work were in just one city" (paragraph 25).

 5. On this basis, the judge concluded that the Appellant was  the  primary
    carer of the child Meher Singh (see paragraphs 27 to 28).

 6. The judge  then  went  on  to  consider  the  provision  in  Regulation
    15(4A)(c) as to whether it could be said that,  "the  relevant  British
    citizen would be unable to reside in the UK or in another EEA state  if
    P were required to leave".  Here the judge held that the word  "unable"
    has to mean something more than that "would find  it  difficult".   She
    went on to say that,

         "If a literal interpretation were used then it would be possible to
         argue that Meher could stay in the UK even  if  both  parents  left
         (which of course is not envisaged) because he could be fostered  or
         adopted or looked after by the state.   This  is  clearly  not  the
         intention of the sub-paragraph.  Interpreting the word  adopting  a
         common sense approach, Meher could not reasonably remain in the  UK
         without his mother" (see paragraph 29).

Grounds of Application

 7. The grounds of application state that the judge wrongly  construed  the
    provisions in Section 15A of the Regulation because the word used there
    is "unable to reside in the UK" and views of the gloss  that  it  would
    not be reasonable to do so was  wrongly  imported  into  the  statutory
    language so as to alter the meaning of  the  provision.   On  3rd  July
    2015, permission to appeal was granted on this basis.

The Hearing

 8. At the hearing  before  me,  Mr  Mills,  appearing  on  behalf  of  the
    Respondent Secretary of State, submitted that in the case  of  Harrison
    [2012] EWCA Civ 1736, the Court of Appeal had  already  made  it  clear
    that the reference to "unable to reside" was a reference  to  a  person
    being "compelled" to leave the UK on account of the removal of  his  or
    her parent.  It simply was not possible to say that the test was one of
    whether it was reasonable to expect the  child  to  relocate  with  the
    parent.  The judge had plainly erred in this respect.  The threshold is
    an extremely high one.  In the circumstances, there was no  reason  why
    the father would be unable to look after  the  child  by  working  less
    hours, or by bringing in outside help.  Second, there was no Article  8
    decision made in relation to the Appellant, as  there  was  no  removal
    directions issued, and so it remained open to the  Appellant  to  argue
    Article 8 when the right time came.  Furthermore, Section 55  also  was
    inapplicable at this stage because the mother was not  being  separated
    from the child, given that there was no removal directions issued.

 9.  For  his  part,  Mr  Vokes  submitted  that  this  case  involved  the
    application of the "Zambrano principle"  which  had  been  affirmed  in
    Derici [2011] EUECJ C-256/11, which confirmed that Regulation  15A  has
    to be considered as a whole and that there must be a person capable  of
    being a primary carer for a British  child,  if  the  intention  is  to
    remove the present primary carer, and this was a  fact-based  exercise.
    The test in Derici  was  whether  the  EU  citizen  has  to  leave  the
    territory of the member state and the European Union as a whole.

10. In this case one had a 3 year old child, who had  lived  entirely  with
    the primary carer, who was the mother, and if  the  mother  was  to  be
    removed, then there was no finding at all that  the  father  was  in  a
    position to look after the child.  However, he  would  have  to  accept
    that the judge had erred in  using  the  language  of  "reasonable"  in
    relation to wording that simply referred to "unable to reside" and this
    had to be accepted as a misdirection by the judge.

11. The important question, submitted Mr Vokes, was whether the error was a
    material one.  It would not be a material  error  because  of  findings
    already made by the judge at paragraph 25, where it  had  been  clearly
    stated that if the mother was removed then 24 hour care would be sought
    for the Appellant child, and given that the father worked  long  hours,
    and worked away from home in London and the West Midlands, he could not
    even be with the child in the evenings.  In  these  circumstances,  the
    child would be "unable to reside" in the UK or EU state if  the  mother
    was removed.

12. In reply, Mr Mills submitted that there did not have to  be  a  finding
    that the father was in a position to look after the  child  because  it
    would be assumed that he would be unless  there  was  evidence  to  the
    contrary.  Secondly, paragraph 67 of  Harrison  makes  it  quite  clear
    that, "it is not a right to any particular quality of  life  ..."  that
    the provisions are addressed  to.   The  question  is  whether  the  EU
    citizen will be compelled to leave.  There is no reason to assume  that
    this will be the case even if the mother was removed because the father
    would be in this country.

Error of Law

13. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law such that I should  set  aside
    the decision (see Section 12(1) of TCEA 2007) and remake  the  decision
    (see Section 12(2) of TCEA 2007).  My reasons are as  follows.   First,
    Section 15A refers to "unable to reside in the UK", and whereas  it  is
    correct that the wording is  not  something  such  as  "would  find  it
    difficult", as the judge found (see paragraph 29), to import a standard
    of "reasonability" which immigration practitioners find in the  context
    of Article 8 balancing exercise analyses, is to alter the  meaning  and
    emphasis of Section 15A(4A) in a manner that effectively  dilutes  that
    provision.

14. Second, this is clear from the Court of Appeal  judgment  in  Harrison,
    which refers to the hardship being such  as  to  require  that  the  EU
    citizen is "compelled" to leave the country where he or she resides.

15. I do not accept Mr Vokes' submission that this is an error, but  not  a
    material one, because it amounts to a formulation of a different  legal
    test, to one which actually is applicable in this present  case.   This
    is, in fact, a classic example of a misdirection in law.

Remaking the Decision

16. I have remade the decision on the basis of the findings of the original
    judge, and the evidence before her, and the  submissions  that  I  have
    heard today.  I am allowing this appeal for the following reasons.

17. First, the case of Derici makes it quite clear that there are two limbs
    to Regulation 15A(4A).  The first is that there is "the  primary  carer
    of a British citizen".  The judge here was clear  in  a  finding  which
    cannot be faulted on the  evidence  before  her.   She  concluded  that
    Meher, being a 3 year old child, was being looked after entirely by her
    mother, the Appellant.  The father,  Surjit  Singh,  was  self-employed
    "and had no set hours of work.  His work took him to  London,  Coventry
    and the Birmingham area" (paragraph 14).  This evidence,  given  before
    the judge was accepted by the judge (see paragraph 25)  and  the  judge
    concluded emphatically to this effect (see paragraph 28).

18. Given these findings, the second  question  is  whether  "the  relevant
    British citizen will be unable to reside in the UK or another EEA state
    if P were required to leave".  The child, Meher Singh Bal, is barely  4
    years of age, has lived entirely  with  his  mother,  in  circumstances
    where there is an absent father, and the findings  of  the  judge  were
    that the primary care given to the child came from the mother alone.

19.  The father, Surjit Singh, was not even around in the evenings  because
    he worked away from  home  so  much.   In  the  circumstances,  if  the
    Appellant  were  to  be  removed  to  India,  then  on  a  balance   of
    probabilities, the British citizen  child  here  "would  be  unable  to
    reside in the UK" because he would be compelled to go with  his  mother
    to India until such time as  the  mother  could  return  back  to  this
    country again.  In the circumstances, the second limb is also satisfied
    and the appeal must be allowed.

Notice of Decision

20. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside the decision of
    the First-tier Tribunal judge.  I remake the decision as follows.  This
    appeal is allowed.

21. No anonymity order is made.
