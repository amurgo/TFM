                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

 1. This is the appellant's appeal against the decision of the  late  Judge
    Upson made following a hearing at Bradford on 30th October 2015.

Background Immigration History

 2. The appellant is a citizen of the Cameroon born on 8th  December  1974.
    He arrived in the UK on 17th December 2001 with entry  clearance  as  a
    student valid until 7th December 2002 and his leave was  then  extended
    on  7th  December  2003.   According  to  the  appellant  he  made   an
    application for further leave to  remain  which  was  refused  but  not
    served.  Subsequently, on 27th June 2007 he  was  detained  and  served
    with removal papers.  He claimed asylum which was refused and he became
    appeal rights exhausted on 23rd July 2007.

 3. On 17th January 2012 he  submitted  an  FLR(O)  application  which  was
    refused on 10th February 2013 on the basis of his marriage to a British
    citizen.  His appeal against  that  decision  was  dismissed  by  Judge
    Wilson on 16th April  2014.   He  made  a  fresh  application  on  26th
    November 2014 on Article 3 grounds and it was this decision  which  was
    the subject of the appeal before Judge Upson.

The Present Application

 4. The appellant suffers from end-stage kidney disease  requiring  ongoing
    long-term renal replacement treatment and he is presently on peritoneal
    dialysis.  His wife is a full-time NHS  nurse  and,  according  to  the
    unchallenged evidence given at the hearing before Judge Upson, provides
    extensive nursing care.  When he wakes up in  the  morning  he  has  to
    disconnect himself from an overnight machine  which  he  cannot  carry.
    His wife gives his Fragmin injections to thin his blood  as  necessary.
    When she comes home from work she gives him his anaemia  injection  and
    at 9pm he reconnects the overnight machine and his wife checks that  it
    is working correctly.

 5. She is a potential kidney donor for the appellant.

 6. There is no issue as to their relationship which  is  accepted  by  the
    Secretary of State.  The couple have been married for  five  years  and
    have known each other for six and a half years.

 7. The appellant's wife has a son who lives with them and who suffers from
    sickle cell anaemia.

The Judge's Determination

 8. The judge recorded that it was conceded that the  appellant  could  not
    qualify under the parent route i.e. paragraph EX.1.(a) of  Appendix  FM
    to the Immigration Rules.  It was however argued that he could  qualify
    under EX.1.(b) i.e. on the basis that he had a genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship with a partner who is in the UK and is a  British  citizen
    settled in the UK or in the  UK  with  refugee  leave  or  humanitarian
    protection and there are insurmountable obstacles to family  life  with
    that partner continuing outside the UK.

 9. The judge said that Judge Wilson's decision was the starting point  for
    his consideration and he had concluded  that  the  appellant  had  come
    nowhere near showing that there were insurmountable obstacles to family
    life with his wife continuing outside the UK*.   The  judge  then  said
    that the  case  turned  on  the  submission  that  the  change  in  the
    appellant's medical  situation  now  provided  for  the  insurmountable
    obstacles set out above.

10. He considered the case of GS India and Others v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 40
    (GS) and said that all of the appellant's  in  that  consolidated  case
    faced situations very similar to that faced by this appellant.  He  was
    satisfied that the medical evidence did not establish that there was  a
    complete absence of any treatment for the appellant in the Cameroon and
    it was likely that there would be treatment even if not of the standard
    and quality to that which he was receiving in the UK.  He had regard to
    Sections 117A to D of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.
     The appellant had given up work in 2008 and he was presently receiving
    expensive treatment to which he was not entitled.   The  appellant  had
    family still living in the Cameroon  and  he  would  therefore  have  a
    support structure there.  It was open to his wife to accompany him.  He
    concluded that the high threshold required  to  succeed  on  Article  3
    grounds had not been met and that in all of the circumstances  of  this
    case it would be proportionate for him to be removed.

The Grounds of Application

11. The appellant sought permission to appeal on the grounds that there had
    been a clear change in circumstances since the first appeal before  the
    Tribunal on human rights grounds had been  determined.   The  appellant
    was presently on the transplant  list  with  a  live  kidney  donor  in
    prospect, his wife, and whereas previously there  had  been  a  finding
    that he would be able to access  treatment  in  the  Cameroon  for  his
    condition on the basis of the evidence presented before this judge from
    a significant source namely the head of the haemodialysis centre at the
    General Hospital in Duala in Cameroon he would not in fact be  able  to
    access such treatment.  It was argued that  the  judge  had  failed  to
    address and weigh in the Article 8 balance the impact of  removal  upon
    the appellant and his family in terms of the denial of treatment by way
    of live transplant that it would cause.  Transplant treatment in the UK
    was of direct relevance to the Article 8 balance.  Although  the  judge
    had considered the various appellants before the Court of Appeal in  GS
    he had failed to refer to GM's case, the only one which  succeeded  and
    in which the appellant had the offer of a  live  donation,  the  proper
    analogy to the present case.  The judge had also failed  to  adjudicate
    upon the clear evidence that transplant treatment was not available  in
    Cameroon.

12. The judge had observed that the appellant's removal from the UK  "would
    allow for a UK citizen to take his place  for  the  treatment  that  he
    seeks to benefit from" but since the transplant treatment that he seeks
    is to refuse his wife's kidney it will not become available to  another
    patient since she is not offering to go through surgery and donate  one
    of her kidneys to the world at large.  Accordingly the present case  is
    stronger than the one in GM which was remitted to  the  Upper  Tribunal
    since the appellant enjoys family life with his proposed donor  whereas
    GM had no family connections.

13. Second the  judge  had  reached  his  conclusion  that  there  were  no
    insurmountable obstacles to family  life  continuing  in  the  Cameroon
    without any consideration of the impact that it  would  have  upon  the
    appellant and his  family,  in  particular  the  failure  to  determine
    whether the appellant would  or  would  not  have  access  to  dialysis
    treatment of any kind.

14. Third he had erroneously assimilated his  conclusions  with  regard  to
    Article 3 into the Article 8 claim whereas they had  to  be  approached
    and applied on their own terms and may yield a different outcome.  What
    was required under Article 8 was a proper fact-sensitive enquiry wholly
    discrete from Article 3, one which  acknowledged  that  he  was  not  a
    health tourist having developed ESKD many years after his entry.

15. Fourth the judge had erred in his consideration of the public  interest
    in Section 117B(3) which was specifically aimed  at  those  who  are  a
    burden on  the  taxpayer  as  a  result  of  their  lack  of  financial
    independence.  There was no evidence that the appellant was  not  self-
    sufficient financially since his wife worked and there was no  evidence
    of state financial support to  the  family.   The  statute  evinces  no
    intention to punish those who are financially  self-sustaining  on  the
    separate basis that they use other  state  resources  whether  that  be
    Social Services or the NHS or otherwise.

16. Fifth the judge had misapplied the case law in  respect  of  Article  3
    which was based on an essential claim of the applicant to stay  in  the
    host state in  order  to  claim  the  benefit  of  social  and  medical
    assistance.  In this case a key element is that in the UK he has access
    to a kidney donor affording him the possibility of life  transformative
    treatment and the reason that it is not available to him in Cameroon or
    anywhere  else  is  because  his  wife  is  based  in  the  UK.   These
    circumstances displace the applicability of the rationale for the D and
    N tests or  alternatively  are  capable  of  amounting  to  exceptional
    circumstances which the judge failed to consider.

17. Finally  the  judge  misapplied  Devaseelan  effectively  treating  the
    earlier  decision  as  determinative  of  his  own.   The  purpose   of
    Devaseelan  is  to  prevent  resolved  factual   matters   from   being
    relitigated but does not apply to findings of law.

18. Permission to appeal was granted by Deputy Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Hill
    for the reasons stated in the grounds on 13th May 2016.

Submissions

19. Mr Toal began his submissions  with  a  consideration  of  the  judge's
    treatment of the decision in GS.  At paragraph 6 of  the  determination
    he acknowledged that the appellant's evidence was that he was ready for
    a transplant except for his albumin levels and, whilst he  was  on  the
    transplant list some further fine tuning of his medication  was  needed
    to reduce protein leak.  It was a key part of the appellant's case with
    which the judge was required to engage.

20. According to the report from the Professor Emeritus at the  Faculty  of
    Medicine  &  Biomedical  Sciences,  University  of  Yaound�,  Cameroon,
    Asonganyi Tazoacha no hospital  in  the  Cameroon  carries  out  kidney
    transplant and so dialysis remains the only outlet for patients to live
    with ESRD.  This evidence was  confirmed  by  Dr  Marie-Patrice  Halle,
    nephrologist and head of the Haemodialysis Centre, Duala, Cameroon in a
    letter dated 12th October 2015.  Kidney transplantation was not carried
    out in the Cameroon and  patients  with  transplanted  kidneys  had  to
    travel  abroad  for  their  follow  up  and  management.   The  judge's
    conclusion at paragraph 29 of his determination that there  was  likely
    to be treatment available for the appellant in Cameroon even if not  of
    the standard and quality to that which he is receiving in  the  UK  was
    not a proper consideration of the facts since  he  entirely  failed  to
    deal with the transplant issue.

21. The judge's consideration of the appellants in GS failed  to  recognise
    that the appellant, GM, was in analogous position to the  appellant  in
    that he too had the offer of  a  transplant  from  a  live  donor,  his
    friend.  The Court of Appeal recognised the transformative effects of a
    transplant from a live donor releasing a patient  from  the  regime  of
    dialysis which is enervating and exhausting.  In failing  to  recognise
    that the sole appellant in the GS cases .........  situation  was  most
    similar to that of the appellant  the  judge  had  erred  in  law.   In
    particular the judge had failed to answer the  question  posed  by  the
    Court of Appeal in GM at paragraph 70 namely:

         "The first concerns the appellant GM.  As I have said in  May  2014
         Guy's  Hospital  indicated  their  willingness   to   assess   GM's
         suitability for a live donor transplant and by 1st July 2014 it was
         clear that the proposed donor Emmanuel Mugisha was compatible.   If
         there is a real possibility of this transplant in the  near  future
         (the details have not been gone into before  us)  there  may  be  a
         question whether GM's removal from the UK,  before  it  is  carried
         out, would violate Article  3  on  the  specific  footing  that  to
         deprive him of such an imminent and transformative medical recourse
         amounts to inhuman treatment".

22. It was an error for the judge not to address this specific  issue.   So
    far as the other appellants in GS were concerned it was  accepted  that
    they could  not  get  treatment  in  their  home  countries  and  would
    therefore die.  Nevertheless none of  them  fell  within  the  kind  of
    exceptional case addressed in D and N.   Mr  Toal  accepted  that  this
    appellant similarly could not meet that test but  could  possibly  meet
    the tests set out at paragraph 70 above  and  his  failure  to  make  a
    finding on that issue was a clear and material error of law.

23. Mr Toal then  turned  to  the  judge's  consideration  of  whether  the
    appellant could succeed within the Immigration Rules  by  reference  to
    paragraph EX.1.(b).   The  evidence  from  Professor  Tazoacha  was  as
    follows:

         "ESRD is managed in Cameroon only by haemodialysis since there  are
         no kidney transplant facilities.  This means that with only Yaound�
         and Douala centres  actually  in  good  service  and  carrying  out
         dialysis twice a week on each  patient  already  on  dialysis,  the
         waiting time for those waiting to get on dialysis  is  quite  long,
         meaning that most patients that can afford it die before they  have
         the opportunity to start dialysis."

    The evidence from Dr Halle  was  that  the  waiting  period  to  access
    haemodialysis was not guaranteed and at the moment most of the  centres
    were oversubscribed with a waiting period of four to six months  before
    a machine can become available.  Normally an ESRD patient needed  three
    to four hour sessions of haemodialysis a week to be stable but  centres
    in the Cameroon could only support two four hour sessions a week due to
    lack of equipment, manpower and high demand.   The  survival  rate  was
    less than 60% within one year.

24. Crucially Dr Halle stated that the appellant would not survive before a
    slot became available since any ESRD patient would not  survive  within
    four  weeks  without  dialysis.   Plainly,  Mr  Toal  submitted,   this
    constituted insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing  in  the
    Cameroon.

25. Third,  the  judge  had  erred  in  his  treatment  of  Judge  Wilson's
    determination in stating that he was bound by it.   In  effect  he  had
    treated it as the finishing point as well  as  the  starting  point  at
    paragraphs 39 and 42 of his determination.

26. The case which was put to Judge Wilson was on a different basis  namely
    that the insurmountable obstacles to family life  continuing  with  his
    wife outside the UK were the fact that his wife was a British  national
    in full-time employment as an NHS nurse, had only visited  Cameroon  on
    one occasion and did not speak the language and that in any  event  her
    son suffered from sickle cell anaemia requiring constant medical  care.
    There was no consideration of the appellant's medical  condition  under
    EX.1.(b).

27. Judge Wilson did consider the fact that the appellant suffered from end-
    stage renal disease in the context of whether removal would affect  his
    moral or physical integrity protected by  Article  8,  it  having  been
    conceded that he could not succeed under Article 3.  It was therefore a
    clear error for Judge Upson to  rely  on  Judge  Wilson's  findings  in
    relation to arguments which were not put before him and not  considered
    by him.  The fact that no proper complaint could be  made  about  Judge
    Wilson's conclusions in respect of physical and  moral  integrity  said
    nothing to the issue of whether the arguments could properly be made in
    the context of the appellant's family life with his British wife.   The
    fact that the appellant will die shortly after arrival in the  Cameroon
    had to be highly relevant to  the  question  of  proportionality  since
    family life would be extinguished within weeks of his return.

28. Finally the judge  had  erred  in  assimilating  his  consideration  of
    Articles 3 and 8 which were distinct.

29. At paragraph 86 of GS Lord Justice Laws said:

         "86. If the Article 3 claim fails (as I would hold it  does  here),
             Article 8 cannot prosper without some separate  or  additional
             factual element which brings the case  within  the  Article  8
             paradigm - the capacity to form and enjoy relationships - or a
             state of affairs having some affinity with the paradigm.  That
             approach was, as it seems to me, applied  by  Moses  LJ  (with
             whom McFarlane LJ and the Master of the Rolls  agreed)  in  MM
             (Zimbabwe) [2012] EWCA Civ 279 at paragraph 23:

                  'The only  cases  I  can  foresee  where  the  absence  of
                  adequate medical treatment  in  the  country  to  which  a
                  person is to be deported will be relevant to Article 8, is
                  where it is an additional factor  to  be  weighed  in  the
                  balance, with other factors  which  by  themselves  engage
                  Article 8.  Suppose,  in  this  case,  the  appellant  had
                  established firm family ties in  this  country,  then  the
                  availability of continuing medical treatment here, coupled
                  with his  dependence  on  the  family  here  for  support,
                  together establish 'private life' under Article  8.   That
                  conclusion would not involve a comparison between  medical
                  facilities here and those in  Zimbabwe.   Such  a  finding
                  would not offend the principle expressed above that the UK
                  is under  no  Convention  obligation  to  provide  medical
                  treatment here when it is not available in the  county  to
                  which the appellant is to be deported.'

         87.  With great respect this seems to me to be entirely right.   It
             means that a specific case has to be made under Article 8.  It
             is to be noted that MM (Zimbabwe) also shows that  the  rigour
             of the D exception for the purpose of Article 8 in such  cases
             as these applies with no  less force when  the  claim  is  put
             under Article 8:

                  '17. The essential principle is that  the  ECHR  does  not
                      impose any obligation under the contracting states to
                      provide those  liable  to  deportation  with  medical
                      treating  lacking  in  their  home  countries.   This
                      principle applies even where the consequence will  be
                      that  the  deportee's  life  will  be   significantly
                      shortened (see Lord Nicholls in N  v  Home  Secretary
                      [2005] 2 AC 296, 304 [15] and N v UK [2008]  47  EHRR
                      885 (paragraph 44)).

                  18.  Although that principle was expressed in those  cases
                      in relation to Article 3, it  is  a  principle  which
                      must apply to Article 8.  It makes no sense to refuse
                      to recognise a 'medical care' obligation in  relation
                      to Article 3, but to acknowledge it  in  relation  to
                      Article 8.'"

30. Lord Justice Underhill at paragraph 111 of GS said:

         "It is that question which this court addressed in  MM  (Zimbabwe).
         Moses LJ with whom the other members of the court agreed, held that
         the no obligation to treat principle  must  apply  equally  in  the
         context of Article 8: see paragraphs 17 to 18 of his judgment which
         Laws LJ sets out at paragraph 89 above.  He then sought to identify
         what role that left for Article 8.  He  acknowledged  that  despite
         that clear cut principle the courts in the UK have declined to  say
         that Article 8 can never be engaged by the health  consequences  of
         removal from the UK, referring to Razgar and also to AJ (Liberia) v
         SSHD [2006] EWCA Civ 1736 (another mental health case): but he drew
         attention to statements in both cases emphasising  how  exceptional
         the  circumstances  would  have  to  be  before   a   breach   were
         established.  In particular he set out at paragraph 20 a passage to
         that effect from the opinion on Lady Hale in  Razgar  which  starts
         with the observation that it is not easy  to  think  of  a  foreign
         healthcare case which would fall under Article 3 but succeed  under
         Article 8.  He concluded at paragraph 23 with a passage which  Laws
         LJ has already quoted but which for ease of reference  I  will  set
         out again ...

         There are possibility  some  ambiguities  in  the  details  of  the
         reasoning in that passage,  but  I  think  it  is  clear  that  two
         essential points are being made.  Firstly the absence or inadequacy
         of medical treatment, even life preserving treatment in the country
         of return cannot be relied on at all as a factor  engaging  Article
         8: if that is all there is, the claim must fail.   Secondly,  where
         Article 8 is engaged by other factors, the fact that  the  claimant
         is receiving medical treatment in this country  which  may  not  be
         available in  the  country  of  return  may  be  a  factor  in  the
         proportionality exercise: but that factor cannot be treated  as  by
         itself giving rise to a breach since that would contravene  the  no
         obligation to treat principle."

31. Accordingly, the judge erred in not engaging with the point made in  GS
    that where Article 8 is engaged, as in this case, the medical treatment
    issue could be a factor in the proportionality exercise.

32. Ms Pettersen's basic submission was that the arguments now  being  made
    were not put before the Immigration Judge, namely  the  fact  that  the
    appellant's wife was a potential donor was not argued before the  judge
    and accordingly there could be no  error  in  his  failing  to  address
    matters which were not put before him.

33. By way of reply Mr Toal submitted  that  this  argument  was  untenable
    since the judge had clearly set out in the determination  that  it  was
    precisely the change of circumstances namely the appellant being on the
    transplant list, which was the basis of the argument being put.

Consideration of Whether there is a Material Error of Law

34. The late judge erred in law and his  decision  is  set  aside  for  the
    following reasons.

35. First it is quite clear that the judge erroneously considered that  the
    six appellants in GS were all in a similar situation in that  they  all
    suffered from end-stage renal failure but he failed  to  consider  that
    the single appellant,  GM,  whose  situation  was  factually  the  most
    similar to that of this appellant was treated differently by the  Court
    of Appeal and indeed his appeal was allowed to the extent that  it  was
    remitted back to the Upper Tribunal for further consideration.

36. The error is material because  it  could  potentially  have  led  to  a
    different result.  There is no challenge to the judge's view that  this
    appellant could not succeed on pure Article 3 medical grounds since  he
    does not meet the threshold set out in D and N.  However the  Court  of
    Appeal clearly signalled at paragraph 70 of GS that there  could  be  a
    question as to whether removal before a transplant in the  near  future
    was carried out could amount to inhuman treatment by depriving  him  of
    an imminent and transformative medical recourse.

37. Second the judge erred in his consideration of the facts in  concluding
    that there was likely to be treatment available for  the  appellant  in
    Cameroon albeit not of the quality to that which he is receiving in the
    UK, when the unambiguous evidence was that he would in fact die  within
    three or four weeks of arrival  there.   This  has  a  bearing  on  his
    consideration of Article 8, which is engaged by virtue of his  marriage
    to a British national, since it is plain from a proper  reading  of  GS
    that the  Court  of  Appeal  considered  that  the  fact  that  medical
    treatment will not be available in the Cameroon could be  a  factor  in
    the proportionality exercise albeit that it could  not  be  treated  by
    itself as giving rise to a breach.

38. Third the judge erred in his consideration of the earlier determination
    of Judge Wilson in relying on it under Devaseelan principles  not  only
    in relation to questions of fact but  also  in  relation  to  arguments
    which were not made at the previous hearing.

39. The errors render the judge's conclusions unsafe not only  in  relation
    to Articles 3 and 8 of the ECHR but also to his  consideration  of  the
    Immigration Rules namely paragraph EX.1.(b) and EX.2.

The Resumed Hearing

40. In compliance with directions  the  appellant  produced  an  additional
    bundle of documents including a witness statement from his wife and  an
    up-to-date letter from the consultant nephrologist at  The  Hull  Royal
    Infirmary.  Dr Imran confirmed  that  Mr  [N]  has  completed  all  the
    investigations required to be active on the transplant list  and  there
    were no issues stopping him from receiving a kidney.  His wife has been
    assessed by the staff as a match, although the team in Leeds  requested
    that she lose some weight before the transplant could go ahead.  In her
    oral evidence Mrs Melville  said  that  she  had  lost  a  stone  since
    December and she intended to lose another stone.Weight loss was for her
    benefit since it reduced potential complications post-surgery,  but  if
    her husband needed the kidney earlier, the team would go ahead with the
    transplant anyway.

Submissions

41. Mr Toal confirmed that he was  no  longer  pursuing  his  arguments  in
    relation to Article 3.

42. His case was that removal would breach Article 8 because the  appellant
    qualified for leave to remain as a partner under  Appendix  FM  of  the
    Rules, including EX.1.

43. He referred to the Immigration Directorate Instructions in relation  to
    guidance on the application of the insurmountable obstacles  to  family
    life test, and submitted that the clear evidence in this case was  that
    there were  such  obstacles  to  family  life  continuing  between  the
    appellant and his wife.  It would take several  months  before  Mr  [N]
    would be able to receive the dialysis he needs to survive and he  would
    die without dialysis within a matter of days.  Plainly his death  would
    make it impossible for  family  life  with  his  partner  to  continue.
    Moreover, even if he was able to obtain haemodialysis in time to  avoid
    dying, the shortcomings of treatment available in Cameroon  would  mean
    that both the appellant and his  wife  would  experience  very  serious
    hardship there.

44. The undisputed evidence was that transplants were not available at  all
    in the Cameroon and, of the eleven  or  twelve  hospitals  which  offer
    dialysis, only one was able to provide peritoneal  dialysis,  which  he
    requires.  The only  peritoneal  dialysis  treatment  available  is  at
    Mbingo  Baptist  Hospital  which  only  provides  treatment  for  acute
    reversible renal failure; this could not sustain him.

45. Mr Toal submitted that the reality was that Mr  [N]  would  die  within
    days of arrival in the Cameroon, days which would  necessarily  involve
    great suffering on his part and by  his  wife  who  would  witness  it.
    Accordingly the appellant met the requirements of the Immigration Rules
    which were a codification of Article 8 and set  out  the  Secretary  of
    State's view of what is required in order to establish a breach.

46. Mrs Pettersen made no submissions.

Findings and Conclusions

47. The requirements of Appendix FMR-LTRP1.1, for leave to be granted under
    the partner route are as follows:

      a) The applicant must  not  fall  for  refusal  under  Section  S/LTR:
         suitability leave to remain; and

      b) The applicant meets the requirements of paragraphs  E/LTRP.1.2-1.12
         and E-LTRP.2.1; and

      c) Paragraph EX.1. applies.

48. It  was  accepted  in  the  reasons  for  refusal  letter  and  in  the
    determination of Judge Wilson that all of those requirements  were  met
    save for paragraph EX.1.

49. EX.1 states that:

         "If  the  applicant  has  a   genuine   and   subsisting   parental
         relationship with a partner who is in  the  UK  and  is  a  British
         citizen... and there are insurmountable obstacles  to  family  life
         with that partner continuing outside the UK."

    Paragraph EX.1.2 says:

         "For the purposes of EX.1(b) insurmountable  obstacles  means  that
         the very significant difficulties  which  would  be  faced  by  the
         applicant or their partner in continuing their family life together
         outside the UK and which could not be overcome or would entail very
         serious hardship for the applicant or their partner."

50. These provisions are discussed in the IDIs  dated  August  2015.   They
    define insurmountable obstacles as:

         "EX.2. For the purposes of EX.1(b) insurmountable  obstacles  means
         the very significant difficulties  which  would  be  faced  by  the
         applicant or their partner in continuing their family life together
         outside the UK and which could not be overcome or would entail very
         serious hardship for the applicant or their partner.

         This means that an insurmountable obstacle can take two forms:

         (i)   A  very  significant  difficulty  which  would  be  literally
             impossible to overcome, so it would be impossible  for  family
             life with the applicant's partner to continue  overseas.   For
             example, because they would not be able to gain entry  to  the
             proposed country of return; or

         (ii) a very significant difficulty which  would  be  faced  by  the
             applicant or their partner in  continuing  their  family  life
             together outside the UK and which could be overcome but  would
             entail very serious hardship for one or both of them."

51. It identifies a number of different factors which might be relevant  to
    the consideration of whether an insurmountable obstacle  exists.   They
    include the ability to lawfully enter  and  stay  in  another  country,
    cultural barriers, the security situation in the country of return and,
    most relevant here

         "the impact of a mental or physical  disability.   Whether  or  not
         either party has a mental or physical disability, a move to another
         country which may involve a period of hardship as the person adjust
         to their new surroundings.  But a  physical  or  mental  disability
         could be such that in some circumstances  it  could  lead  to  very
         serious hardship, for  example  due  to  lack  of  healthcare  that
         amounted to an insurmountable obstacle."

52. The unchallenged facts in this case are that the appellant suffers from
    end stage kidney disease requiring ongoing long-term renal  replacement
    treatment and is presently on peritoneal  dialysis.   He  has  required
    dialysis since  January  2014  and  has  received  peritoneal  dialysis
    treatment which "meets his current  needs  until  such  time  as  renal
    transplantation will hopefully occur."  Without dialysis he  is  likely
    to die within  days,  as  confirmed  in  the  letter  from  Hull  Royal
    Infirmary Nephrology Clinic

53. His wife is a potential donor.  There are currently no issues  stopping
    Mr [N] from receiving a kidney transplant.  His wife  is  on  a  weight
    reduction programme.  She has lost, in the last nine months, about half
    of the weight which the transplant team advise should  be  lost  before
    they transplant can go ahead.

54. It is not disputed by the Secretary of State  that  Mr  [N]'s  survival
    depends upon regular dialysis treatment or renal  transplantation,  and
    although the Secretary of State's original position appeared to be that
    treatment was available in the Cameroon, that  argument  is  no  longer
    being advanced by the Secretary of State.

55. The evidence about availability of treatment in the Cameroon comes from
    four sources.  Professor Tazoacha, in his report dated  18  July  2014,
    states that no hospital in the Cameroon carries out kidney transplants.
     There are eleven public haemodialysis centres but the waiting time for
    those wanting dialysis is so long that most patients that can afford it
    die before they have the opportunity to start dialysis.

56. In a letter dated 12 October 2015 Dr Marie-Patrice Halle, Head  of  the
    Haemodialysis  Centre,  General  Hospital  Douala  said   that   whilst
    peritoneal dialysis treatment was available at Mbingo Baptist  Hospital
    it was for acute reversible renal failure and not for end stage  kidney
    disease.  She said that haemodialysis was available but with a  waiting
    list of four to six months. She confirmed that  kidney  transplantation
    was not available in the Cameroon.

57. A letter from Dennis Palmer of Mbingo Baptist Hospital also states that
    peritoneal dialysis was available for acute kidney injury but  not  for
    chronic dialysis.

58. Finally, a letter from Dr Kalamback, Nephrologist  in  charge  of  BUEA
    Regional Haemodialysis dated 17th September 2015 confirms that  neither
    kidney transplant nor peritoneal dialysis were  available  for  chronic
    cases.

59. Plainly, Mr [N]'s death would make it impossible for family  life  with
    his British wife to continue.  Moreover, the time between  his  arrival
    in the Cameroon and his death would necessarily amount to very  serious
    hardship.His circumstances fall squarely within those envisaged in  the
    IDI's.

60. It is therefore quite clear that the appellant meets  the  requirements
    of paragraph EX.1, the  only  outstanding  issue,  and  accordingly  is
    entitled to succeed under the Immigration Rules.

Decision

61. The original judge erred in law.   His  decision  is  set  aside.   The
    appellant's appeal is allowed. No anonymity direction is made.
