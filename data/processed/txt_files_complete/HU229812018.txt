                                                                   Appellant

                          (anonymity direction made)
                                                                  Respondent


                          DECISION AND REASONS (P)

 1. The Respondent (SO) is  a  national  of  Nigeria  born  in  1988.   The
    Secretary of State seeks to deport him because in 2013 he was convicted
    of conspiring to supply Class B drugs (cannabis) and was sent to prison
    for 27 months.

 2. SO sought to resist automatic  deportation  on  human  rights  grounds,
    submitting that his removal would be 'unduly  harsh'  for  his  British
    family. On the 11th November 2019 the First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  I.M
    Scott) allowed his appeal, having accepted that at least in respect  of
    his stepdaughter 'C1', SO's case was made out. C1 has been experiencing
    significant mental health  difficulties  and  was  in  the  process  of
    seeking gender re-assignment. All of the evidence before  the  Tribunal
    indicated that C1 required a high level of support from her family, and
    that she was particularly close to SO whom the  Tribunal  described  as
    her "closest parent and primary carer". The  Tribunal  found  that  his
    continuing support was "essential to her  emotional  and  psychological
    wellbeing" and  that  in  all  the  circumstances  the  impact  of  his
    deportation would for C1 be unduly harsh.

 3. The Secretary  of  State  sought  permission  to  appeal.  The  central
    complaint was that the First-tier Tribunal erred in law in finding that
    it would be unduly harsh for C1 if her stepfather were to  be  removed.
    The Secretary of State pointed to several  Court  of  Appeal  decisions
    underlining the high threshold inherent in the test, and submitted that
    the First-tier Tribunal had failed to  "consider  adequately  that  the
    appellant's wife may care for the children alone,  as  she  would  have
    done while the appellant was in prison".

 4. Permission was granted on the 29th January 2020 by First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Chohan in the following terms:

          "It was a matter for the judge to consider  whether  it  would  be
         unduly harsh on the appellant's stepchild and other children if  he
         were to be removed. There is no error in that respect, however,  it
         does seem that the judge has not engaged  with  the  strong  public
         interest in deportation".

 5. The matter was then forwarded for listing.

 6. On the 23rd March 2020 the government announced measures to combat  the
    spread of Covid-19. This resulted in the suspension of live hearings at
    Field House. On the 13th April 2020 the file came before me for review.
     On that day I  wrote  to  the  parties[1]  requesting  submissions  on
    whether it would be appropriate to determine the appeal in this case on
    the papers. I also made the following  observations,  inviting  comment
    from the Secretary of State about the scope of the grant of permission:



         "I have read the grant of permission by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
         Chohan which is, with respect, rather opaque.  Judge Chohan appears
         to expressly refuse permission for the Secretary of State to  argue
         that there was any error of law  in  respect  of  the  findings  on
         'undue harshness' but grants permission on the ground  that  First-
         tier Tribunal Judge I.M Scott may not have engaged with the  strong
         public interest  in  deportation.  Given  the  statutory  framework
         (s33(2) UK Borders Act 2007 read with Part 5A of  the  Nationality,
         Immigration and Asylum Act 2002) and the guidance in KO  (Nigeria)v
         Secretary of State for the Home Department [2018] UKSC 53  (to  the
         effect  that  'undue  harshness'  is  a  stand-alone  test  to   be
         determined simply with reference  to  the  child),   the  grant  of
         permission is rather difficult to understand. If there is no  error
         in approach to undue harshness,  it  follows  that  the  First-tier
         Tribunal has already, within the  framework  of  the  rules/s33(2),
         given appropriate weight to the public interest in deportation".

 7. I now have before me a 'Rule 24' response prepared by Mr Ell of Counsel
    on behalf of SO dated 8th March 2020, a 'Skeleton Argument' prepared by
    Mr S. Whitwell of the Secretary of State's Specialist Appeals Team  and
    finally 'Written Submissions'  prepared  by  Ms  J.  Isherwood,  Senior
    Presenting Officer on behalf of the Secretary of State dated 16th April
    2020. What I do not have is a direct response to my directions  of  the
    13th April, as it would appear that these 'crossed' with the endeavours
    of the parties to assist the Tribunal in writing.      I  have  however
    been informed  by  the  Secretary  of  State  that  I  should  read  Mr
    Whitwell's skeleton and Ms Isherwood's  submissions  as  her  response:
    this was communicated by way of an email on the 1st May 2020 by  Senior
    Presenting Officer Mr Diwnycz.  Neither party has made any objection to
    this matter being determined on the papers.

    The Secretary of State's Appeal

 8. I have read the grounds, and the written submissions of Mr Whitwell and
    Ms Isherwood with care.  The Secretary of  State's  case  is  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal erred in law in the following material respects:

      i) In failing to take material matters into  account.  In  particular:
         the fact that the Appellant's wife cared  for  the  children  alone
         when he was in prison and the fact that  a  previous  Tribunal  had
         determined, in 2015, that the Appellant's deportation would not  be
         unduly harsh for C1;

     ii) Failing to give adequate reasons. In particular: the Judge has  not
         explained why it would  be  unduly  harsh  for  C1  to  attend  her
         counselling sessions on her own, or alternatively in the company of
         her mother or grandmother;

    iii) Misapplication of the 'undue  harshness'  test.  The  Secretary  of
         State submits that the Judge has erred in finding the circumstances
         of this case capable  of  reaching  the  high  threshold  of  undue
         harshness.  Reliance is placed on  a  number  of  Court  of  Appeal
         authorities: AJ (Zimbabwe) [2016]  EWCA  Civ  1012,  AR  (Pakistan)
         [2010] EWCA Civ 816, PG (Jamaica) [2019]  EWCA  Civ  1213  and   OH
         (Serbia) [2008] EWCA Civ 694 to submit that the best  interests  of
         the child are not to be treated as routinely outweighing the strong
         public interest in deportation, that the statutory  scheme  expects
         and approves the separation of families as a result of deportation,
         and that the commonplace distress that children will  feel  when  a
         parent is deported is insufficient to meet the very high test.

 9. In respect of ground (i) Mr Whitwell emphasises the significance of the
    findings of a 2015 Tribunal which had concluded that the primary  care-
    giver in the family was the children's  mother;  SO's  deportation  was
    found to present a "huge disruption" for the family but this fell short
    of undue harshness in circumstances where his wife could care  for  the
    children alone.  Mr Whitwell submitted that these  Devaseelan  findings
    were as a matter of law, the starting point for Judge  Scott,  who  had
    not adequately explained  why  she  now  chose  to  depart  from  them.
    Although Judge Scott does refer to the passage  of  time,  Mr  Whitwell
    points out that she does not go on to explain why  that  might  justify
    reaching a different conclusion from her predecessor.   In  respect  of
    C1's exploration of the possibility of gender reassignment Mr  Whitwell
    points out that it is no more than that at this stage, and submits that
    it is unclear why this necessitates the  presence  of  her  stepfather.
    There was suggestion in the evidence that he  attends  the  counselling
    sessions with C1 because it is her preference, and because  her  mother
    is finding it hard to come to terms with the  idea  that  her  daughter
    might become a son. In Mr Whitwell's submission  these  facts  are  not
    capable of disclosing undue harshness.

10. Under the heading  'ground  (ii)'  Mr  Whitwell  submits  that  in  its
    evaluation of the public interest the First-tier Tribunal has erred  in
    failing to recognise that this was an application to revoke an existing
    deportation order: as such paragraphs 390 and  390A  should  have  been
    applied. I am unsure as to why this submission falls under the  heading
    of ground (ii); indeed I am unsure if it is  a  matter  raised  in  the
    grounds at all. I am however prepared to consider it in the context  of
    the Secretary of State's general complaint about the  approach  to  the
    public interest.

11. I note for the record that Ms Isherwood's submission introduce two more
    points that are not pleaded in the grounds. The first is that there was
    no  evidential  basis  for  the  Judge's  conclusion  that  C1  has   a
    relationship with her stepfather capable of meeting the undue harshness
    test.   Again,  permission  was neither  sought  nor  granted  on  this
    point - essentially a rationality challenge -  but  I  am  prepared  to
    consider it as part of the Secretary of State's general assault on  the
    'unduly harsh' findings made by the First-tier Tribunal. The second new
    matter raised by Ms Isherwood is her  submission  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal erred in going on to make findings on proportionality 'outside
    of the rules' on Article 8. I am not going to address that matter  save
    to say that I refuse permission to argue it on the  basis  that  it  is
    irrelevant to this appeal and is in any  event  a  submission  that  is
    wrong in law: Hesham Ali [2016] UKSC 60.

    SO's Response

12. I bear in mind that Mr Ell's 'Rule 24' response was  drafted  prior  to
    the Secretary of State's submission  of  either  the  skeleton  or  her
    written submissions.  In summary SO submits that Judge  Scott  directed
    herself to the correct legal tests (as  expressed  in  the  Immigration
    Rules at paragraphs 398-399) and that there is nothing to indicate that
    she erred in the application of those tests.  The  First-tier  Tribunal
    specifically considers the significant weight to  be  attached  to  the
    public interest in the deportation of foreign  criminals,  and  directs
    itself to the findings of the earlier Tribunal. On the Devaseelan point
    Mr Ell submits that Judge Scott was perfectly entitled to  depart  from
    the findings made in 2015, given the passage of time  and  the  changed
    circumstances of this family, viz the increased reliance of C1 upon SO,
    and her changing mental health needs.  It is further submitted that  on
    the specific facts of the case the First-tier Tribunal was entitled  to
    find that the distress  that  would  be  experienced  by  C1  upon  her
    stepfather's deportation elevated this case above the 'commonplace'.




    Discussion and Findings

13. The real difficulty with this appeal is encapsulated in Judge  Chohan's
    grant of permission, and in my commentary upon it in my  directions  of
    the 13th April 2020 [at �6 above]. The central thrust of the  Secretary
    of State submissions, supported by what Mr Whitwell memorably describes
    as a  "cacophony  of  cases",  is  that  the  public  interest  in  the
    deportation of foreign criminals is very great indeed.    There can  be
    no doubt about that. But in a case such as this, the structure of  Part
    5A Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and the decision of the
    Supreme Court decision in KO make clear that  this  weight  is  already
    accounted for by the test at s117C(5): where the impact of  deportation
    on a child is found - as a matter of fact - to be  unduly  harsh,  then
    the public interest will be outweighed.  The  statements  made  by  the
    Secretary of State about the weight to be attached to her side  of  the
    scales are all perfectly correct in law, but  in  this  case  the  real
    question is  whether  the  First-tier  Tribunal  erred  in  making  the
    findings that it did about C1.

14. The cases pleaded in the grounds, and referenced at my  �8(iii)  above,
    are unanimous in their emphasis on the high threshold to be  surmounted
    by applicants who seek to establish that  their  deportation  would  be
    unduly harsh for a family member. It is not a threshold that can be met
    by showing that a child will be upset, or that he or she will miss  the
    deported parent. Parliament has expressly contemplated  that  child  be
    separated from parent so the ordinary consequences that would flow from
    such a separation are not going to be sufficient to meet the test.  The
    child being extremely distressed is not likely to be sufficient (except
    perhaps where there was strong evidence of psychological damage).  Life
    being made more difficult for the family concerned, for instance in the
    presentation of practical challenges, is not going to pass muster since
    most families will undergo some period of adjustment. Such difficulties
    can properly be described as commonplace.  The outcome  for  the  child
    concerned needs to be serious: it needs to be "bleak" or "severe".  The
    Secretary of State concludes her review of the caselaw [at �13  of  her
    grounds] by asserting that in its light, it can be seen that the  "FTTJ
    has erred in finding that the appellant's deportation would  result  in
    unduly harsh circumstances on his step-child". How might the Judge have
    done so?

15. The first ground is that the Tribunal failed to take  material  matters
    into account. I  start  with  the  Devaseelan  point.  As  Mr  Whitwell
    elucidates in his written argument, SO had already had a  human  rights
    appeal dismissed. In January 2015,  following  a  hearing  in  December
    2014, the First-tier Tribunal (Judge A.E Walker) had found that SO  had
    failed to demonstrate that the test of undue  harshness  was  met.   Mr
    Whitwell correctly submits that these findings had to be  the  starting
    point for First-tier Tribunal Judge I.M Scott, and that  in  accordance
    with the guidance  in  Devaseelan  (Second  Appeals  -  ECHR  -  Extra-
    Territorial Effect) Sri Lanka * [2002] UKIAT 00702 Judge Scott had  to
    provide some explanation as to why, on the  evidence  before  her,  she
    found otherwise. Mr Whitwell acknowledges that  Judge  Scott  addresses
    this matter at her �57-60, but  submits  that  her  reasoning  was  not
    adequate.

16. I am quite satisfied that it was. This was a case involving a child. At
    the date of the appeal before Judge Walker, C1 was 8 years old.  SO had
    been married to her mother for less than two years when he had gone  to
    prison, and had only been back in the family home a  matter  of  months
    when the appeal was heard.  At the date of  the  hearing  before  Judge
    Scott, C1 was 13 years old, and had spent the preceding five  years  of
    her life living with SO.  A considerable amount of time in the life  of
    this young person had therefore elapsed, as Judge Scott points  out  at
    her �60.   She need not articulate the point in any more detail,  since
    its import is obvious - in the context of a family, the passing of five
    years is likely in itself to be  significant.  Indeed  in  granting  SO
    permission to judicially review the refusal to treat his application to
    revoke the deportation  order  as  a   'fresh'  human  rights  claim  -
    litigation which ultimately resulted in the appeal before Judge Scott -
    Upper Tribunal Judge Jackson also refers to the "passage  of  time"  as
    being an important factor in this case[2].    The evidence  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal moreover indicated that in that time  the  dynamics
    within the family had changed. In 2014 the evidence before Judge Walker
    was that the primary carer of the children was their mother. In 2015 it
    indicated that C1 had developed a particularly strong bond with SO, who
    was supporting her with mental health issues that had  emerged  in  her
    early adolescence.   Judge Scott makes reference to  these  matters  at
    her �60 in the context of the social worker's report  and  the  medical
    evidence relating to C1.   Judge  Scott's  decision  to  evaluate  that
    evidence as it stood at the date of the hearing before her was entirely
    in accordance with the guidelines in Devaseelan.

17. I would add that there is another reason why it  would  not  have  been
    appropriate for  Judge  Scott  to  go  further  than  she  did  in  her
    recognition of the decision of Judge Walker. That is that Judge  Walker
    made his decision in 2015, long before the Supreme Court's decision  in
    KO (Nigeria), and  indeed  before  the  Upper  Tribunal's  decision  in
    MAB (para 399; "unduly harsh")  USA  [2015] UKUT 00435  (IAC)  which
    foreshadowed it.  His 'undue harshness' assessment was  therefore  made
    by balancing the interests of the children against the interests of the
    state in deporting SO, an unhelpful muddying of the  waters  for  Judge
    Scott, who was obliged by the later clarification of the law to take  a
    quite different approach.

18. The Secretary of State further submits that the First-tier Tribunal has
    failed to have regard to the fact  that  SO's  partner  cared  for  the
    children alone when he was in prison. That she did  so  adequately  was
    plainly relevant to determining what detriment that they  might  suffer
    from his absence today.   I am not satisfied, having had regard to this
    comprehensive  decision,  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal   failed   to
    appreciate the material  history  of  this  family.   At  its  �37  the
    Tribunal records the evidence of SO's partner that during  his  absence
    "she found it very  difficult  to  support  herself  and  the  children
    financially. His absence was also difficult emotionally"; the  decision
    goes on at �38 to note that the children found SO's  absence  from  the
    family home "very hard". C1 became "very emotional" whilst C2,  then  a
    little boy of about 6, became violent, both at home and at school. What
    has happened since then, explains the First-tier Tribunal  at  its  �41
    and 47, is that C1 has developed mental health issues, and that  SO  is
    the central figure supporting her through  those  difficulties.  It  is
    this latter factor which leads the Tribunal to make the  findings  that
    it does: �76-81.  In those circumstances I am not  satisfied  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal failed to appreciate that SO was  not  living  with
    his family whilst he was in jail;  I  am  further  satisfied  that  any
    finding on their circumstances then - some seven years ago -  is  going
    to be of any real relevance in its evaluation  of  their  circumstances
    now.

19. Ground (ii) is that the First-tier Tribunal has failed to  explain  why
    it concluded that C1 needed SO to attend her counselling sessions  with
    her. There is no merit in that ground.  First,  it  suggests  a  rather
    reductionist reading of the First-tier Tribunal's decision. C1 did need
    SO to take her to her counselling  sessions  but  her  needs  were  not
    limited to that: as the First-tier Tribunal points out at its  �78  and
    �79, it was their "very close bond" which was of significance to her on
    a daily basis. Second, because reasons were offered as to why it had to
    be SO, and those reasons were accepted by the  Tribunal:  C1  does  not
    feel able to discuss her  desire  for  gender  re-assignment  with  her
    mother, who is in turn finding it difficult to cope with her daughter's
    desire to become a son, and C1's maternal grandmother "is  elderly  and
    is not well enough" [at �45].

20. We then reach the nub of the  Secretary  of  State's  case,  at  ground
    (iii): that it simply was not open to  a  rational  decision  maker  to
    conclude that the high threshold of  'undue  harshness'  was  on  these
    facts met. I would observe at the outset that the Secretary of State is
    on somewhat shaky ground in making this submission now. In  2018  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Jackson granted SO permission to judicially  review  the
    negative 'fresh claim' decision, finding it arguable that  this  was  a
    claim with a "realistic prospect of success before a properly  directed
    Tribunal". The Secretary of State thereafter appears to  have  accepted
    that position, since she consented to the matter proceeding to a  fresh
    appeal.   The evidence before Judge Scott being a  good  deal  stronger
    that that available to Judge Jackson in 2018, it is  difficult  to  see
    how it can be said that a claim with a realistic  prospect  of  success
    then can be one that was bound to fail now.

21. The dicta cited by the Secretary of State  in  her  grounds  emphasises
    that the threshold is a high one, and  that  the  commonplace  distress
    ordinarily suffered by any child who faces the loss of  a  parent  will
    not be sufficient to meet it.  C1 was not  however  an  ordinary  child
    suffering that commonplace distress. As the  history  set  out  in  the
    determination explains, she is a child whose early years were marred by
    serious domestic violence at the hands of her biological  father  [�35]
    and who has  since  developed  a  particularly  strong  bond  with  her
    stepfather SO [for instance �25 and �30]. She  experienced  behavioural
    problems when he was sent to prison but she has  overcome  these  since
    his release in 2014 [�27]. Her current difficulties are centred on  her
    desire to change her gender, an  enormously  challenging  psychological
    issue for a young person to be dealing with [�25, 29, 30]. Judge  Scott
    had before her independent evidence of C1's high levels of anxiety  and
    self-harming behaviour, and in particular how it is SO that C1 looks to
    for support. It was he, rather than her mother or grandmother, who  she
    chose to "come out" to, not long after his  release  from  prison.  The
    independent social worker  whom  Judge  Scott  accepted  as  an  expert
    witness put it like this:

         "I am aware that she has a close bond with  her  step-father,  whom
         she idolises. Therefore the hurt she feels and harm that she causes
         to herself is entangled in the threat  of  separation  as  well  as
         aspects of her past and present that continue to  impact  upon  her
         mental wellbeing.   Whilst  it  is  important  that  [C1]  receives
         psychotherapy to fully explore her history and to  support  her  in
         this transitional journey, is it vital  that  aspect  of  her  life
         remains stable through that process.

         [SO] is  the  parental  figure  whom  she  relies  upon.  Therefore
         separation of this relationship  is  not  as  simple  as  a  parent
         leaving the family home, but more significantly losing  a  part  of
         herself  and  the  unique  attachment  that   derives   from   this
         relationship".

    As Judge Scott notes at his �55, this evidence was consonant  with  the
    conclusions of a mental health outreach worker who had also spent  time
    with C1.

22. It is therefore abundantly clear that C1  was  not  an  ordinary  child
    living in ordinary circumstances. The psychological harm that she would
    suffer if her stepfather were to be removed from the  family  home  was
    not the "commonplace" distress or difficulty  that  any  family  member
    would experience when impacted by a deportation. The  consequences  for
    C1 could properly be described as bleak or  severe.   It  follows  that
    Judge Scott's decision was within the range of reasonable responses and
    the Secretary of State's ground is not made out.

23. I deal finally with the point  made  by  Mr  Whitwell  in  his  written
    submissions. That is that this  was  a  human  rights  claim  with  its
    origins in an application for the revocation of the  deportation  order
    made in 2013.  It is clear from the First-tier Tribunal  decision  that
    Judge Scott understood perfectly well that this was a revocation  case:
    the relevant chronology is set out at the beginning  of  the  decision.
    Mr Whitwell is however correct to  note  that  the  Tribunal  fails  to
    direct itself to paragraphs  390  or  390A  of  the  Rules.  I  am  not
    satisfied that anything turns on that, since it is apparent from  those
    provisions that success under paragraph 399 would be  determinative  of
    the outcome of the appeal:

         '390. An application for revocation of a deportation order will  be
         considered in the light of  all  the  circumstances  including  the
         following:

         (i) the grounds on which the order was made;

         (ii) any representations made in support of revocation;

         (iii) the interests of the community, including the maintenance  of
         an effective immigration control;

         (iv) the interests of the applicant,  including  any  compassionate
         circumstances.

         390A. Where paragraph 398  applies  the  Secretary  of  State  will
         consider whether paragraph 399 or 399A applies and, if it does not,
         it will only  be  in  exceptional  circumstances  that  the  public
         interest in maintaining the deportation order will be outweighed by
         other factors.'

24. For the reasons I have set out  above  I  am  not  satisfied  that  the
    Secretary of State has established that the decision of the  First-tier
    Tribunal is flawed for error of law and the decision is upheld.

    Anonymity

25. SO is a foreign criminal who would not ordinarily attract any right  to
    the protection of  anonymity.  This  case  does  however  turn  on  the
    presence in the United Kingdom, and mental  health  of,  his  children.
    Having had regard to the guidance in the Presidential Guidance Note  No
    1 of 2013: Anonymity Orders, I am concerned that the identification  of
    SO could lead to the identification of his children, and that it  would
    therefore be appropriate to make an order in accordance with Rule 14 of
    the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules  2008  in  the  following
    terms:

         "Unless and until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
         Appellant before the First-tier Tribunal  (herein  referred  to  as
         'SO') is granted anonymity.  No report of these  proceedings  shall
         directly or indirectly identify him or any member  of  his  family.
         This direction applies to, amongst others, both the  Appellant  and
         the Respondent.  Failure to comply with this direction  could  lead
         to contempt of court proceedings"

    Decisions

26. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains no material  error  of
    law and it is upheld.

27. There is an order for anonymity.
