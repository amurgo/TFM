                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

                           Decision and directions

1. The appellant appeals with permission against the decision of the  First-
   tier Tribunal refusing him an extended family member  residence  card  as
   the unmarried partner of an EEA national exercising Treaty rights in  the
   United Kingdom, pursuant to  the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
   Regulations 2006 (as amended).

2. Permission to appeal was granted in the light  of  the  judgment  of  the
   Court of Appeal in Khan v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home  Department
   [2017] EWCA Civ 1755.  On Monday January 15  2018,  David  A  Grand,  who
   represent the applicant, asked the Tribunal to find an error of  law  and
   remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal for remaking without an  oral
   hearing.

3. By an order made on 17 January 2018 and sent to the parties  by  post  on
   22 and 23 January 2018, and by email at 11 am on  23  January  2018,  the
   Upper Tribunal directed the respondent to inform the Tribunal  not  later
   than noon today, Wednesday 24 January, whether she opposed  the  remittal
   of this appeal to the First-tier Tribunal without an  oral  hearing.   No
   response was received from the respondent within the time limited.

4. Accordingly, and pursuant to  paragraph  40  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
   (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (as amended), I allow and remit  this  appeal
   to the First-tier Tribunal for rehearing with  no  findings  of  fact  or
   credibility preserved.

DECISION

5. For the foregoing reasons, my decision is as follows:


   The making of the previous decision involved the making of an error on  a
   point of law.
   I set aside the previous decision.  The decision in this appeal  will  be
   remade in the First-tier Tribunal on a date to be fixed.


Date:     10 May 2018               Signed:  Judith A J C Gleeson
