                     Before Upper Tribunal Judge Hanson


Having considered  all  documents  lodged  and  having  heard  the  parties'
respective representatives, Mr R de Mello, of  Counsel,  on  behalf  of  the
Applicant, instructed by Veja & Co Solicitors and Mr R  Dunlop  of  Counsel,
on behalf of the Respondent, instructed by the Government Legal  Department,
at a hearing at Field House, London on 18 March 2016.


            Application for judicial review: substantive decision



(1)    Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Rintoul  granted  permission  to  bring  this
judicial review  claim on the  basis  of  the  applicants  amended  grounds,
dated 24 June 2015, which    claimed the same issues that arose in  relation
to the impugned decision were to  be considered by the Court of Appeal in  a
pending test case. On 31 October 2015   judgment was  handed  down  by  that
court in R (Kiarie & Byndloss) v SSHD   [2015] EWCA Civ 1020. The claims  in
both cases being dismissed.


(2)   On 1 March 2016 the respondent served a supplementary decision  letter
in    which the question of whether it would be a breach of the  applicant's
rights       under       Article  8  ECHR  was  specifically  considered  in
relation to the section 94(B)     certification. The  apparent  omission  of
consideration  of  this  element  formed  the      core  challenge  to   the
decisions under consideration  before  the  Court  of  Appeal       and  was
omitted  from  the  impugned  decision.  The  fact  the  omission  has  been
remedied makes the original challenge academic.



(3)   The amended grounds as pleaded have no arguable merit in light of  the
Court of    Appeal decision.

(4)   At the hearing Mr de Mello provided a document described as a  revised
      skeleton argument and made a series of oral  submissions  relating  to
the   applicants medical condition. It was argued  that  the  delay  between
the two     decisions was such that the respondent should have  invited  the
applicant to     make further representations which  would  have  given  him
the opportunity to     introduce the medical material.

(5)   The decision of the 1  March  2016  was  made  on  the  basis  of  the
material already        available  with  the  application  and  by  specific
reference to the human rights     considerations in the  original  decision.
The applicant has failed to  establish  any     legal  obligation  upon  the
respondent to consult further, especially as  the    supplementary  decision
is not a new decision.

(6)   Mr de Mello submitted that if the Tribunal is against him in  relation
to his      assertion the challenge to the section  94(B)  certification  is
not academic his       second ground is that the respondent  has  failed  to
consider the medical material     properly which has led to a bad  decision.


(7)   As stated above, the challenge to the  section  94(B)  certificate  is
arguably    academic and it has not been made out otherwise. In relation  to
the medical      aspects of the case a number of documents  referred  to  by
Mr de Mello were not   before  the  decision  maker  as  they  were  not  in
existence at that time.  An MRI   scan  is  dated     February  2016  and  a
letter from a doctor in India dated 3 February     2016. A  letter  produced
at the hearing from the doctor in  India  and  a  letter  from      the  NHS
relied upon by Mr de Mello were not before the respondent at all.

(8)   The pleaded grounds of challenge have not been amended to reflect  the
basis of    the submissions made by Mr de Mello  regarding  medical  issues.
There has been   ample time for such an application to be  made.  Mr  Dunlop
objected to      permission being granted to Mr de Mello to amend  the  clam
on  the       basis  of  his      revised   skeleton   argument   and   oral
submissions. The skeleton was     filed late on    the 4 March, on 16  March
the applicant sought to rely upon evidence not all of     which  was  before
the respondent and now at the hearing was attempting  a  third   attempt  to
change the terms of the challenge.

(9)   It is accepted that the  nature  of  a  case  may  change  during  its
lifetime requiring a   party to consider the basis of the  claim  originally
pleaded and to make    changes as required. In this application the  limited
grounds on which       permission was granted were overtaken  by  the  later
judgment of the Court of     Appeal. Previous applications  have  been  made
to amend the claim yet no    application was made  to  amend  the  claim  to
include a challenge on the basis of     the  medical  situation  before  the
hearing. This claim is based  in  part  on       documents  that  have  only
comparatively recently come  into  existence  and  if  it      represents  a
discrete issue upon which  the  applicant  wishes  to  apply  for  leave  to
remain a further application can be made.


(10)  Mr Dunlop had no  notice  of  the  application  before  the  day.  The
overriding  objectives of the Tribunal are to conduct litigation fairly  and
justly.

(11)  There is an obligation upon the parties to help the Upper Tribunal  to
further the      overriding objective. An application of this nature,  which
is an attempt to make  a substantial change to the nature of the  claim,  is
not illustrative of the      applicant's     representatives  assisting  the
Tribunal in this way. The application   to amend is refused  as  (i)  it  is
very late, (ii) the application should have been   made  in proper  form  in
advance of the hearing setting out in detail  the  nature  of     the  claim
(iii) such application made at  this  late  stage  ambushed  the  respondent
who was given no advanced notice of the same, (iv) the application  breaches
the   time limits set out in the directions made  by  the  Tribunal  on  the
grant of    permission for the filing  of  any  additional  evidence  to  be
relied upon.  There is       also no pleaded challenge to  the  decision  of
the 1 March 2016 despite the lack of    the same being commented upon by  Mr
Dunlop in his skeleton argument filed   on the 11 March 2016.

(12)  The interests of justice do not support permission  to  further  amend
being       granted at this stage which is refused. In  light  of  this  the
only challenge before  the Tribunal is that to the impugned decision of  the
26 March 2015 which has not  been shown to have merit.

Order


(13)  I therefore make an Order that  the  judicial  review  application  be
dismissed.


Permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal


(4)   I refuse permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal because there  is
no reason   for that court to interfere with this decision.

Costs


(5)   The applicant shall pay the respondents costs  summarily  assessed  in
 the sum    of ï¿½4805.
