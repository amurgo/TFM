                                     and



               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant appeals with permission against the determination of  the
    First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Farrelly,  promulgated  on  12  July  2016
    dismissing their appeals against the decision of the respondent made on
    8 January 2015 to refuse them leave to remain.


 2. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was granted on  23  November
    2016

 3. On 2 June 2017 I gave the following directions:-

        1. Having reviewed the material on file; and, given the  overriding
           objective and the need for proportionate decision making, I have
           concluded that it is appropriate to seek  to  dispose  of  these
           appeals without the need for a hearing.


        2. NA (Libya) v SSHD  [2017]  EWCA  Civ  143  at  [29]  is  binding
           authority for the proposition that it is  the  position  at  the
           date of promulgation of a decision  which  is  relevant  to  the
           consideration of whether that decision involved the making of an
           error of law, not when the decision was signed by the judge.


        3. As at the date of promulgation, the  two  minor  appellants  had
           spent 7 years in the United Kingdom. That was, in the  light  of
           MA (Pakistan) [2016] EWCA Civ 705 at [40] to  [49],  a  material
           issue that needed to be considered. There is, in my  preliminary
           view, no sufficient  consideration  of  that  issue,  the  judge
           considering article 8 only  in  the  alternative,  and  that  he
           failed  properly  to  consider  the  evidence  relating  to  the
           children and the second appellant.


        4. Accordingly, it is my preliminary view that the decision of  the
           First-tier Tribunal must be set aside and remade. It is also  my
           preliminary view  that,  given  the  lapse  of  time  since  the
           decision was made, that it is appropriate to remit the  decision
           to a differently constituted First-tier Tribunal for  a  hearing
           de novo.


        5. Accordingly, unless either party objects in writing supported by
           cogent argument within 5 working days  of  the  issue  of  these
           directions, it is my provisional intention to allow  the  appeal
           without a hearing on the basis of these directions and remit  it
           to the First-tier Tribunal


 4. There has been no response to these directions by the  respondent.  The
    appellants have responded asking for clarification of the hearing date,
    but raising no objection


 5. Accordingly, I am satisfied that neither party objects  to  the  matter
    being determined without a hearing and has nothing further to say. I am
    satisfied that that the determination of the  First-tier  Tribunal  did
    involve the making of an error of law for the reasons  set  out  above,
    and must therefore be set aside.  Given the nature of  the  error,  and
    the failure to make proper findings in respect o  children,  and  given
    that over a year has elapsed since the findings were made, I remit  the
    appeal to the First-tier Tribunal for  a  fresh  determination  on  all
    issues.


 6. The hearing on 26 July 2017 will not now take place.


Summary of conclusions

     1. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making
        of an error of law and I set it aside.


     2. I remit the  decision  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  a  fresh
        decision on all issues


     3. The appeal must not be before Judge Farrelly
