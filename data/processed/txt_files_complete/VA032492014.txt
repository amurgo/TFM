Representation:
For the Appellant:     No legal representative; sponsor, Shera Sidibeh,
present
For the Respondent:    Mrs S Saddiq, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a  citizen  of  Gambia,  born  on  15  May  1957.   By
    application dated 13 May 2014 she sought a long term  (5  year)  family
    visitor visa.  Her main address and contact  details  in  the  UK  were
    through her daughter, a UK citizen living in Edinburgh.  The  applicant
    is the headmistress of a primary school.  The purpose of her visit  was
    "spending time with my children, I see them once every year."

 2. The Entry Clearance Officer refused the application by notice dated  30
    May 2014.  The decision notes that the appellant had  a  previous  visa
    for the same purpose.  However, the ECO holds that evidence of  funding
    is insufficient, and is not satisfied by the appellant's account of her
    current circumstances in the Gambia that she would leave the  UK  after
    her visit.  Her bank statement, credits and balances do not  correspond
    with her declared monthly income  from  her  employment,  and  she  has
    received a cash payment equivalent to ï¿½8,065 without providing details.
     "I recognise that your sponsor proposes  to  bear  the  cost  of  your
    visit.  However, I must take into account your  personal  and  economic
    circumstances in your home  country  ...  In  the  absence  of  further
    documentation  I  cannot  be  satisfied   ...   that   your   financial
    circumstances are as documented."

 3. As advised in the notice of  decision,  the  only  relevant  ground  of
    appeal in this case is  "....  that  the  decision  is  unlawful  under
    section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 (public  authority  not  to  act
    contrary to the Human Rights Convention) as being incompatible with the
    appellant's Convention rights" (section 84(1)(c) of the 2002 Act).

 4. Thus, even if the appellant were to show that her case was a  good  one
    by the terms of the Immigration Rules, she would still have to  satisfy
    human rights grounds in order to succeed.

 5. In her grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal the appellant said:

         'The appellant's daughter and sponsor ... is a British citizen  and
         resides in the UK ... It is plausible that her ... mother  is  able
         to visit her provided she provides all the required  documents  ...
         and doesn't exceed the time limit ...

         The appellant has other children that reside legally in the UK  and
         she has come to visit them consecutively year after year from  2009
         except the past 2 years ... she has never overstayed her visa ...

         ... The appellant ... has been running a  nursery  school  for  the
         past 22 years, enjoys good health and  social  relations  with  the
         community as well as serving  as  a  senior  member  of  local  and
         international  bodies  ...  [and]  has  no  intention  of  residing
         permanently in the UK.'

 6. On receipt of  the  grounds  of  appeal,  an  Entry  Clearance  Manager
    maintained the adverse decision in terms of a review dated 23  December
    2014.  The copy of  that  review  which  the  respondent  has  provided
    comprises 2 pages.  They are not numbered and do not read continuously.
     The second page begins in the middle of a  sentence.   If  the  review
    contained any reasoning, it  has  gone  missing.   Page  2  contains  a
    request that any evidence provided in future should be afforded  little
    weight.  That part is plainly formulaic, referring to the appellant  as
    "he".

 7. The appeal came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Matthews to be decided
    "on the papers".  Although the  appeal  was  limited  to  human  rights
    grounds, the judge's determination, promulgated  on  26  January  2015,
    correctly made findings in relation to the Immigration  Rules,  because
    these are relevant to any proportionality exercise.

 8. On the basis of evidence considered in particular at paragraphs 13, 14,
    15 the judge found that the application did meet  the  requirements  of
    the Immigration Rules.  That appears to be  an  impeccable  conclusion.
    In the Upper Tribunal, Mrs  Saddiq  did  not  suggest  that  there  was
    anything wrong with it.

 9. The judge then turned to Article 8, and found that  the  appellant  and
    sponsor being mother and daughter, Article 8 was engaged.

10. The determination goes on at paragraph 25:

         "I note the pressing  need  for  fair  application  of  immigration
         control and the ability of the  appellant  and  sponsors  still  to
         remain in contact or to enjoy each other's company in Gambia.  I do
         not find the proposed interference to  be  disproportionate  and  I
         find that the respondent by setting out and applying the  Rules  as
         they are drafted has sought to sufficiently provide for, foster and
         facilitate Article 8 ECHR rights as required."

11. The judge then held that the appellant had "not discharged  the  burden
    of proof" and dismissed the appeal.

12. The appellant sought  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal,
    pointing out that she intended to visit her family  during  the  summer
    vacation, that she had made  similar  visits  in  compliance  with  the
    Rules, that she had adequate financial resources coupled  with  support
    from her children and that her children  could  accommodate  her.   All
    those contentions are consistent with the favourable  factual  findings
    in the determination.

13. On 30 July 2015 First-tier Tribunal Judge Nicholson granted  permission
    to appeal.  He noted that the  judge  had  found  that  Article  8  was
    engaged, and said:

         "Given the obvious contradictions in  the  judge's  decision  -  in
         finding  that  the  respondent  had  applied  the  Rules  ...  when
         rejecting the application,  despite  apparently  finding  that  the
         Rules were met - the grounds are arguable.

         Neither Mustapha (Article 8 in entry clearance) [2015] UKUT 112 nor
         Adjei (visit visas - Article 8) [2015] UKUT 0261 had  been  decided
         at the  time  of  the  judge's  decision  but  both  are  relevant.
         Mustapha decided that ability to meet the requirements of the Rules
         was relevant when  considering  proportionality.   Adjei,  however,
         decided that there was  no  need  to  consider  proportionality  if
         Article 8 was not engaged ... Should this appeal  proceed  further,
         it is difficult to see on what basis Article 8  could  in  fact  be
         engaged and the final outcome may well be inevitable.  Nonetheless,
         since it was accepted by the judge that Article 8 was  engaged  and
         there is an arguable  error  of  law  related  to  proportionality,
         permission should be granted."

14. The  sponsor,  Shera  Sidibeh,  explained  that  the  appellant  has  4
    children, all adult and all now legally residing in the UK.  3 of  them
    are citizens.  She  has  3  grandchildren  here,  2  daughters  of  the
    sponsor, and the daughter of the sponsor's sister.  The first member of
    the family came to the UK in 2004.  The UK  family  members  all  visit
    Gambia from time to time.  They stay with their mother.  She and  their
    father divorced many  years  ago.   He  now  lives  in  the  USA.   The
    appellant has visited the UK 3 or 4  times  since  2009.   The  sponsor
    takes care of ticket and  accommodation  arrangements.   The  appellant
    visits during the school summer holidays.  The present application  was
    quite expensive, and they are all disappointed with the outcome.

15. Mrs Saddiq referred me to a further case - Kaur (visit appeals; Article
    8) [2015] UKUT 487.  Kaur holds that the starting  point  must  be  the
    state  of  evidence  about  the  appellant's  ability   to   meet   the
    requirements of the Rules, but disputes of fact relevant to the Article
    8 assessment must also be resolved, bearing in mind that the burden  is
    on the  appellant.   Unless  an  appellant  can  show  that  there  are
    individual interests at stake covered by Article 8 "of  a  particularly
    pressing nature" so as to give rise to a "strong claim that  compelling
    circumstances may exist to justify  the  grant  of  leave  outside  the
    Rules"  an  appellant  is  exceedingly  unlikely  to   succeed.    That
    proposition must also hold good in visitor appeals.

16. Mrs Saddiq said that the judge should not have found that Article 8 was
    engaged, but to the contrary.  On that basis, the appeal ought to  have
    been dismissed.  There being no error in the outcome, the determination
    should be left to stand.

17. I reserved my determination.

18. The judge found that the requirements to the Rules were met.   That  is
    no longer an issue.  The judge also found that Article 8  was  engaged.
    Based on those 2 findings,  it  is  difficult  to  make  sense  of  the
    eventual outcome.  The judge refers to  the  "pressing  need  for  fair
    application of immigration control" but that must be served by granting
    applications which meet the terms of the Rules, not by refusing them.

19. The burden of proof is on the appellant, but the final decision did not
    depend on discharging any burden.  There was no  remaining  dispute  of
    fact.  What  was  required  was  a  fact-sensitive  judgment,  but  not
    resolution of a matter of proof.

20. The conclusion of the  determination  cannot  be  reconciled  with  its
    earlier findings.  I do not find that it should be left to stand on the
    basis that the same outcome was inevitable, because:

         (a)      a decision should rest on some rational foundation;

         (b)      if the respondent wished to rely on grounds on  which  she
         had been unsuccessful in the First-tier Tribunal, that should  have
         been stated in response to the grant of permission as  required  by
         the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008, rule  24(3)(e).
         The respondent made no challenge prior to the hearing in the UT  to
         the finding that Article 8 was engaged;

         (c)      the outcome was at least within the margins of debate.

21. Mustapha suggests that successful cases are not likely to extend beyond
    the relationships of husband and wife or other close partners or parent
    and minor children, but neither Mustapha nor any other  authority  says
    "never".  The borderline between family and private life depends on the
    facts.  Whether that borderline is  crossed  is  significant,  but  not
    resolutive of whether Article 8 is engaged.

22. The appellant's family comprises her children and grandchildren who are
    all in the UK.  Her proposed visits are not based on any whim,  but  on
    relationships which must be the most important in her life and of  high
    importance to all her descendants.  Her family may all variously  visit
    Gambia, but the most efficient way to maximise contact must be  by  one
    person visiting here.

23. I think the facts of this case were sufficient to justify  the  judge's
    finding that Article 8 was  engaged.   Particularly  in  absence  of  a
    properly framed challenge by the respondent, I see no justification for
    setting that finding aside.

24. On the undisturbed findings that the requirements  of  the  Immigration
    Rules were met and that Article 8 was engaged, the outcome should  have
    been that the appeal was allowed.  This is not a case like  Kaur  where
    an appellant faced with an adverse visit visa decision seeks to succeed
    outside the Rules.  It is difficult to see what public  interest  there
    might be in maintaining a decision which has been  wrongly  reached  in
    terms of the Rules, in a case where Article 8 is engaged.  That is  why
    the conclusion in the First-tier Tribunal determination reads so oddly.
     There was no  "pressing  need  for  fair  application  of  immigration
    control" to justify dismissing the appeal.

25. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.  The appeal,
    as originally brought to the First-tier Tribunal, is allowed  on  human
    rights grounds.

26. No anonymity order has been requested or made.
