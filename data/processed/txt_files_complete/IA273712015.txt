                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS









      Introduction


      1.    The Appellant appealed with permission granted by Upper Tribunal
           Judge Martin on 24 August  2017  against  the  determination  of
           First-tier Tribunal Judge Greasley who had dismissed the  appeal
           of the Appellant who had sought leave to  remain  as  a  Tier  4
           (General) Student Migrant.  The Respondent's decision  had  been
           made on 16 July 2015 following an application made on 15 January
           2013 so the previous version of section 82  of  the  Nationality
           and Asylum Act 2002 applied, i.e., the appeal was  unrestricted.
            The decision and reasons was promulgated on 22 December 2016.


      2.    The Appellant is a national of Bangladesh.   The  Appellant  had
           been granted leave to  enter  as  a  Tier  4  (General)  Student
           Migrant on 10 February 2010.  His application for  an  extension
           of stay was refused because he had submitted a TOEIC certificate
           from ETS, which ETS had notified the Respondent was invalid  due
           to use of a proxy test taker.  The Appellant  was  also  refused
           because his CAS sponsor was no longer approved by  the  date  of
           decision.


      3.    Judge Greasley found that the Respondent had demonstrated  to  a
           high  degree  of  probability  that  the  Appellant  had   acted
           dishonestly through the use of a third party proxy  test  taker.
           He  found  that  the  Appellant's  evidence  in   rebuttal   was
           insufficient and accordingly dismissed the appeal.


      4.    Permission to appeal  was  granted  because  it  was  considered
           arguable that the judge had erred by failing to consider whether
           it was realistic for the Appellant to have  produced  additional
           evidence and also by failing to consider the Appellant's account
           of what happened on the day of the test.


      5.    Standard directions were made  by  the  tribunal.    A  rule  24
           notice opposing the appeal was filed by the Respondent.




      Submissions


      6.    Mr Biggs for the Appellant relied on the permission.  In summary
           he sought to argue that the judge had wholly failed  to  provide
           adequate reasons for his findings.  It was unreasonable to  have
           expected the Appellant to obtain  CCTV  footage  from  the  test
           centre. It was simply impractical. Similarly it was unreasonable
           to have expected the Appellant to be able to produce  a  receipt
           for the test fee after all of this time.  There  was  no  reason
           for such a receipt to have been kept.   The  judge  should  have
           investigated the Appellant's motives, which would have  produced
           a balanced approach to the evidence.  The judge  had  speculated
           about material in the public domain available to the  Appellant,
           and was wrong to have done so.    The determination  was  unsafe
           and should  be  set  aside  and  remade  by  another  First-tier
           Tribunal judge.


      7.    Mr Wilding for the Respondent relied on the rule 24  notice  and
           submitted that there was plainly no material error of law.    In
           the first place the judge had found that  the  burden  of  proof
           resting on the Respondent had been discharged by  the  technical
           evidence produced.  That finding, explained by reference to  the
           reports and the Respondent's witness statements, was dispositive
           in itself.  The findings were reinforced by the evidence  as  to
           the bad record of the colleges involved.   The  CCTV  issue  had
           been raised by the Appellant himself.  The judge  had  discussed
           motive.  The judge was entitled to find that there was a lack of
           evidence of actual attendance.  It had obviously  been  open  to
           the Appellant to produce such materials.  The judge had referred
           to the evidence produced  by  the  Appellant  without  a  narrow
           focus.  The onwards appeal should be dismissed.


      8.    In reply, Mr Biggs briefly emphasised  the  failure  to  examine
           motive  and  speculation  on  the  judge's  part.   The  judge's
           expectations had been unreasonable.




      No material error of law finding


      9.    In the tribunal's view the grant of permission to appeal (albeit
           in  limited  terms)  was  based   on   a   misreading   of   the
           determination.   It  was  full  and  careful,  setting  out  the
           procedural history, the  evidence  and  submissions  in  detail,
           which was appropriate given the nature of  the  appeal.   As  Mr
           Wilding  correctly  submitted,  the  keystone  of  the   judge's
           findings was that the legal  burden  of  proof  resting  on  the
           Secretary of State had been amply  discharged  by  the  evidence
           provided.  The case against the Appellant was proved to  a  high
           degree of probability.  The  judge  then  proceeded  to  examine
           whether the Appellant was able to rebut the case against him, in
           an  impartial  manner  having  overruled  an  attempt   by   the
           Respondent to submit late evidence.


      10.   The Appellant chose to put the possibility of  CCTV  footage  in
           issue: see [26] of his witness statement, mentioned by the judge
           at [36] of his determination.   It  was  for  the  Appellant  to
           obtain such material or at least to try to obtain it and produce
           evidence if he maintained it would  vindicate  him.   The  judge
           accurately recorded that nothing at all was done and it  counted
           against the Appellant.  This was not  a  situation  of  a  judge
           making exigent demands but rather of a judge drawing  a  logical
           conclusion from the Appellant's own evidence.


      11.   It was submitted that the judge had taken an  unreasonable  view
           of the absence of the alleged cash receipt  for  the  test,  but
           that submission has no substance either.  The  receipt  was  for
           ï¿½150, according to the Appellant,  which  it  is  reasonable  to
           regard as a significant sum of money for most students, and  for
           which no other evidence of payment could  exist,  unlike  credit
           card payment  or  bank  transfer.   It  was  important  evidence
           relating to a mandatory requirement for his continuing leave  to
           remain and hence his studies.  The judge was entitled to take an
           adverse view, especially when set against the other deficiencies
           in  the  Appellant's  evidence,  and  the  bad  record  of   the
           Appellant's college.


      12.   Far from ignoring motive, the judge discussed it at [39] of  his
           determination.  His starting point was that  the  Appellant  had
           achieved creditable scores in his IELTS  test  and  had  studied
           English previously (i.e., had no obvious motive to  cheat),  but
           gave reasons for finding that the lack of obvious motive on  the
           Appellant's  part  did  not   dent   the   Respondent's   strong
           technically based evidence, because there could be various other
           plausible explanations for the Appellant's not having taken  the
           test in person.  The  judge  gave  sufficient  consideration  to
           motive in his evaluation of the Appellant's evidence.


      13.   The whole sorry ETS scandal has received extensive publicity and
           there has been a large volume of litigation, with many  reported
           decisions.  The judge was  correct  to  state  that  information
           about the form taken by the examinations has inevitably  reached
           the  public  domain,  which  diminishes  the  weight  which  the
           Appellant's explanation of his attendance attracted.    To  cite
           but one example, the decision in SM and  Qadir  v  Secretary  of
           State for the Home Department (ETS -Evidence - Burden of  Proof)
           [2016] UKUT 00229 (IAC) contains such information and  links  to
           further  information,  including  other  reported   cases,   all
           instantly accessible. The judge's comments were not speculation,
           but an accurate statement of fact from  a  specialist  tribunal.
           It is also plain from [42] of the determination that  the  judge
           took a number of relevant facts and matters  into  account  when
           finding that the Appellant had failed to rebut the  Respondent's
           evidence.


      14.   The tribunal agrees with Mr  Wilding's  submissions  as  to  the
           judge's analysis and findings,  which  were  open  to  him,  and
           cannot be impugned as superficial or unreasonable.  The tribunal
           concludes that Mr Biggs's submissions, like the onwards grounds,
           amount to no more than disagreement with the  judge's  decision.
           The tribunal finds that there was no material error  of  law  in
           the decision challenged.




      DECISION


      The appeal is dismissed


      The making of the previous decision did not involve the  making  of  a
      material error on a point of law.  The decision stands unchanged.
