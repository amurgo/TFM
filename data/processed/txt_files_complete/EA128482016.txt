                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    The appellant appealed the  respondent's  decision  dated  17  October
    2016 to refuse to issue a residence card recognising a permanent  right
    of residence as the family member of an EEA national who had a retained
    right of residence.

2.    First-tier Tribunal Judge Asjad ("the judge") dismissed the appeal  in
    a decision promulgated on 18 February 2018. The judge noted that  there
    was no dispute that the appellant married an EEA  national  on  8  June
    2010 and that the couple divorced on 19 October 2015 (the date  of  the
    Decree Absolute). The judge made the following findings:

                        "7.  I find that the  EEA  Sponsor  (Soares)  was  a
                 self-employed  person  during  the   period   12/03/11   to
                 01/04/2014.  Evidence  of  her  self-employment  has   been
                 provided in the form of a letter from her  Accountants  (at
                 97) that confirms she commenced her self-employment on  the
                 12th  of  March  2011  and  was  trading  as  'Neuza  Maria
                 Hairdresser Beuticia'. There are in addition,  tax  returns
                 for the following periods:

            2011/2012 - pages 6-9
            2012/2013 - page 84
            2013/2014 - page 87

             In  addition,   there   are   National   Insurance   Class   II
                 contributions bills for  the  period:  2011(93),  2012(89),
                 2013(90),  2014(91).  Evidence  that   the   business   was
                 advertised in the Small Business Directory and yell.com was
                 also provided (101 and 103).

                             8.   There is I find  no  evidence  apart  from
                 small reference in  the  Accountants  Letter,  to  the  EEA
                 Sponsor's self-employment in 2015. There are no tax returns
                 or National Insurance Bills for the  period  2014/2015.  It
                 follows that at the  date  of  the  divorce,  the  19th  of
                 October 2015, it has not been shown that  the  EEA  Sponsor
                 was exercising treaty rights in the UK. I accept that  that
                 the Appellant has demonstrated that he has been working and
                 has been self-employed since  that  date  as  a  'Qualified
                 Person' but in the absence  of  any  evidence  of  the  EEA
                 Sponsor's status in 2015 I am unable to find  that  the  5-
                 year period is met in this case."

3.    First-tier Tribunal Judge Froom granted permission to  appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal in the following terms:

                           "1.      The  FtTJ  arguably   failed   to   make
                 sufficient findings of fact regarding the  sponsor's  self-
                 employment/employment in 2015 and arguably erred in failing
                 to give any reason for not relying on the P60 for  the  tax
                 year 2015/2016.
                            2.    It is not clear, although the  FtTJ  could
                 not have known it, that the "date of  termination"  is  the
                 date divorce proceedings  were  commenced  (see  Baigazieva
                 [2018] EWCA Civ 1088). It is therefore necessary to make  a
                 finding as to when that was."

Decision and reasons

4.    It is not necessary to make detailed findings relating  to  the  error
    of law  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  decision  because  Ms  Isherwood
    accepted that the decision involved the making of  an  error  following
    the Court of  appeal  decision  in  Baigazieva.  The  judge  cannot  be
    criticised because the decision was issued after he heard this  appeal,
    but the  Court  of  Appeal  since  found  that  the  relevant  date  of
    assessment for the purpose  of  regulation  10(5)  of  the  Immigration
    (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006  is  the   date   divorce
    proceedings are initiated and not the date  when  the  proceedings  are
    finalised.

5.    The judge found that there was evidence to show that  the  appellant's
    spouse was exercising rights of free movement from March 2011  onwards.
    However, he concluded that there was little evidence to show  that  she
    was a 'Qualified Person' in 2015. The appellant argues that  the  judge
    failed to take into account a copy of a P60 for his  wife's  employment
    during the tax year 2015-2016. The P60 showed that she earned ï¿½9,723.66
    from employment with Cathy Care Ltd in that tax year. The evidence  was
    relevant to a proper determination of the appeal. The failure  to  take
    into account a material consideration also amounts to an error of  law.
    The decision is set aside.

6.    The decision must be remade with reference  to  the  correct  date  of
    assessment, which is the date when divorce proceedings were  initiated.
    In  his  witness  statement,  the  appellant  made  clear  the  divorce
    proceedings commenced in June 2015. In fact, it makes little difference
    in this case because the date of the commencement  of  the  proceedings
    and the Decree Absolute fall within the same tax year  covered  by  the
    P60. Given that the appellant's wife had been earning  an  income  from
    self-employment as a hairdresser  for  several  years.  There  is  some
    evidence to suggest that she continued trading  in  2014  and  2015.  A
    letter from Jecom & Co Accountancy Services dated 01 April 2016  states
    that  the  appellant's  spouse  continued  to  trade  as  Neuza   Maria
    Hairdresser Beauticia in October 2015 (covering  the  period  when  the
    divorce proceedings commenced) and this was reflected in the profit and
    loss account for 2015. The appellant does not appear to have been  able
    to obtain a copy of the accounts or his wife's  tax  returns  for  that
    period. However, it is at least likely that she may have  been  earning
    an income from self-employment  during  2015  in  light  of  the  other
    evidence showing trading over previous years. The  P60  indicates  that
    the appellant's wife was likely to be  supplementing  her  income  with
    employed work at the relevant time.

7.    To require specific evidence to show trading  or  employment  for  the
    exact date in June 2015 would apply too high a standard of proof. I  am
    satisfied that the evidence, as a whole, shows that it is  more  likely
    than not that the  appellant's  wife  was  exercising  rights  of  free
    movement at the date when divorce proceedings were  initiated  in  June
    2015. The appellant was residing in accordance with the regulations  at
    the date divorce proceedings  were  initiated  and  therefore  met  the
    requirements of regulation 10(5). There is evidence to  show  that  the
    appellant was likely to be working at the relevant time in mid-2015 and
    therefore met the requirements of regulation 10(6).

8.    The appellant resided in the  UK  as  the  family  member  of  an  EEA
    national from 2011 and retained a right of residence  in  2015.  Having
    retained a right of residence he has continued to reside in the  UK  in
    accordance with the EEA Regulations  2006.  I  am  satisfied  that  the
    appellant has resided in the UK in accordance with the regulations  for
    a continuous period of five years and that he meets the requirements of
    regulation 15 of the EEA Regulations 2006.

9.    The First-tier Tribunal decision involved the making of an error on  a
    point of law. The decision is set  aside,  remade  and  the  appeal  is
    allowed.
