Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Diwncyz, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    No appearance


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Entry Clearance  Officer  (ECO)  in  Islamabad
    against the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Atkinson)  to
    allow the Respondent's appeal from the refusal of his  application  for
    entry clearance as the spouse of Samina Kausar  (the  Sponsor)  who  is
    settled in the UK.

 2. For the sake of clarity throughout this decision, I shall refer to  the
    Entry Clearance Officer as "the Respondent", and to Mr  Faisal  Ali  as
    "the Appellant" which reflects their respective  positions  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

Background

 3. The Entry Clearance Officer refused the Appellant's application on  two
    grounds:

      a) The Appellant and his Sponsor were not in a genuine relationship.

      b) The Appellant had not met the financial requirements of Appendix  M
         of the Immigration  Rules,  because  he  had  failed  to  meet  the
         requirement to submit specified evidence under  Appendix  FM-SE  of
         the Rules.

 4. So far as the first ground is concerned,  it  would  appear  that  this
    matter is no longer in issue; the  First-tier  Tribunal  made  specific
    findings that it was satisfied that the Respondent and the Sponsor  are
    in a genuine relationship and those findings have not been  challenged.



 5. The challenge by the Entry Clearance  Officer  relates  solely  to  the
    financial requirements part of the Rule.

 6. In his decision the judge set out that he heard reliable evidence  from
    the Sponsor.  He records at [8] that he is satisfied that  the  Sponsor
    has a gross annual salary of �19,267.56 through  her  employment  as  a
    taxi office manager.  The judge then further records that the  Sponsor,
    although paid initially by cheque, was from  June  2014  paid  in  cash
    monthly.  He records she was issued with the requisite payslips and  in
    the tax year to April 2015 the Sponsor earned �17,661.93 with tax  paid
    of �1,696.20 and national insurance contributions of �1,244.21.

 7. The judge then said the following:

         "I reject the submission on  behalf  of  the  Respondent  that  the
         appeal should be  refused  because  the  Appellant  has  failed  to
         provide a bank statement in the form prescribed by Appendix  FM-SE:
         that is that a bank statement must  be  provided  which  shows  the
         Sponsor's salary being paid into that account."

    He followed this up saying:

         "I reject that submission  because  there  is  sufficient  evidence
         before me to show that the financial threshold has been met in this
         case on the basis of the Sponsor's  oral  account  and  from  other
         supporting documentation which is credible."

    He then allowed the appeal.

 8. The Respondent sought and was granted permission to appeal.   Thus  the
    matter comes before me.





The UT Hearing

 9. Mr Diwncyz appeared on behalf of the Entry Clearance Officer; there was
    no appearance on behalf of the Appellant.  Prior  to  the  hearing  the
    Appellant's representatives, Kabir Ahmed & Co Solicitors, wrote to  the
    Tribunal stating "the Appellant wishes to withdraw  his  appeal".   The
    letter went on "we shall therefore not be attending tomorrow's  hearing
    and the Appellant's wife and Sponsor shall not be in attendance".

10. An appeal in the  Upper  Tribunal  may  only  be  withdrawn  with  that
    Tribunal's consent. The terms of Kabir Ahmed & Co's letter suggest they
    are seeking "to withdraw" the matter before me. There appears to  be  a
    lack of appreciation that the appeal before me is brought by the  Entry
    Clearance Officer not the Appellant. In these circumstances  I  do  not
    give my consent to the withdrawal of the appeal.   The  case  therefore
    proceeds.

11. Mr Diwncyz on behalf of the Entry Clearance  Officer  made  submissions
    following the lines of the grounds seeking  permission.   He  submitted
    that the judge is plainly in error because he has failed to follow  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules which set out the documents which
    must be provided.  In those circumstances, he invited me to  find  that
    the judge  erred  and  the  decision  must  be  remade  dismissing  the
    Appellant's appeal.

Consideration

12.  The  relevant  part  of  Appendix  FM-SE  sets  out   the   evidential
    requirements needed  to  meet  the  income  threshold  level  in  entry
    clearance cases.

13. Appendix FM-SE  requires  that  all  the  specified  evidence  must  be
    provided in respect of salaried employment  namely  (a)  payslips,  (b)
    letters from employer who issued the payslips  and  (c)  personal  bank
    statements corresponding to the same periods as the payslips.

14. It is clear that there was no bank statement in  the  prescribed  form,
    before the judge.  Instead of addressing that point directly the  judge
    said that he intended to rely upon the Sponsor's oral evidence together
    with surrounding documentary evidence.  That is plainly wrong.

15. I find that had the judge  set  out  and  followed  the  provisions  of
    Appendix FM-SE he would have been bound  to  conclude  that  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer's decision was in accordance with the  law  and  that
    therefore the Appellant's appeal against that decision must fail.

16. It was simply not open to the judge to remedy  the  deficiency  in  the
    Appellant's documentary evidence, by relying on  the  "credibility  and
    other documents" produced by the Sponsor.

17.  Further  as  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  points  out,   evidential
    flexibility does not apply here.  It is a  policy  designed  to  remedy
    documentary omissions, not one to enable an  Appellant  to  bypass  the
    specific evidence Rule.

18. So far as Article 8 ECHR is concerned, this does  not  appear  to  have
    been raised in submissions before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  but  that
    seems to be as far as it goes.  No submissions have  been  made  before
    me, predicated on the Immigration Rules  not  being  substantially  met
    such as to merit an Article 8 consideration.

19. I find for the foregoing reasons, that the decision of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal contains an error of law requiring  the  decision  to  be  set
    aside and remade.  I hereby remake the decision dismissing  the  appeal
    of Faisal Ali against the  decision  of  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer
    Islamabad refusing him entry clearance as the spouse of Samina  Kausar.



Notice of Decision

The Entry Clearance Officer's appeal is allowed.  The decision of the First-
tier Tribunal is set aside.  The appeal of Mr Faisal Ali against  the  Entry
Clearance Officer's decision to refuse him entry dated 9th February 2015  is
dismissed.

Anonymity direction is not made.

As I have dismissed the appeal of Mr Faisal Ali, no fee award is payable.
