It is plain from the architecture of the  Rules  as  regards  partners  that
EX.1 is "parasitic" on the relevant Rule within Appendix FM  that  otherwise
grants leave to remain. If EX.1 was intended to be a free- standing  element
some mechanism of identification would have been used. The structure of  the
Rules as presently drafted requires it to be a component part of  the  leave
granting Rule. This is now made plain by  the  respondent's  guidance  dated
October 2013.

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms E Martin at Bennett House, Stoke  on  Trent  (14th
                    November  2013);  Mr  N  Smart,   Senior   Home   Office
                    Presenting Officer (15th January 2014)
For the Respondent:    Mr K Thathall of UK Immigration Law Chamber



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1.    This is an appeal against a determination  by  First-tier  Tribunal
      Judge Ghaffar  who  allowed  an  appeal  against  a  decision  by  the
      appellant (hereafter the SSHD) against a decision to  refuse  to  vary
      leave to remain in the  UK  dated  13th  March  2013  pursuant  to  an
      application dated 26th November 2012.


   2.    The SSHD had also taken a decision dated the same date to remove Ms
      Sabir (hereafter the claimant) from the UK  pursuant  to  s47  of  the
      Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006. Judge Ghaffar had failed
      to reach any decision upon the appeal  against  this  element  of  the
      decision. Before me on 14th November 2013 Ms Martin acknowledged  that
      the decision to remove under s47 was unlawful and  she  withdrew  that
      decision.


   3.    Judge Ghaffar found that the claimant did not meet the requirements
      of paragraph 284 of the Immigration Rules and dismissed her appeal  on
      that ground; found that she did meet  the  requirements  of  paragraph
      EX.1 of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules in as much as there  were
      insurmountable obstacles to the claimant and her spouse relocating  to
      Pakistan and allowed the appeal on that ground and allowed the  appeal
      on human rights grounds.


   4.    Permission to appeal was sought by the SSHD, and  granted,  on  the
      grounds that the judge had misdirected herself as to  the  meaning  of
      "insurmountable obstacles" in EX.1 and  had  failed  to  undertake  an
      adequate Article 8 assessment; in particular had  failed  to  consider
      the SSHD's interest in maintaining an effective immigration policy and
      failed to take account of the income threshold.


      ERROR OF LAW (heard and decided on 14th November 2013)


   5.    Mr Thathall, who submitted a helpful and thorough skeleton argument
      for the hearing on 14th November 2013  with  copies  of  the  relevant
      documents to which he  referred  including  the  relevant  Immigration
      Rules and the SSHD's policy as to their interpretation, submitted,  in
      essence, that paragraph EX.1 was  a  free-standing  paragraph  of  the
      Rules  and  that  the  judge's  decision   that   the   couple   faced
      insurmountable obstacles in living together as  husband  and  wife  in
      Pakistan was a decision reasonably open to him on the evidence  before
      him and the facts found. He made particular reference to [16]  of  the
      First-tier Tribunal determination which he said was a finding that the
      claimant would be subjected to a forced marriage if  she  returned  to
      live in Pakistan.


   6.    Ms Martin submitted, in essence, that paragraph EX.1 was not  free-
      standing but had to be read as a requirement  of  R-LTRP.  Furthermore
      she relied upon the grounds seeking permission to  appeal  as  regards
      Article 8 and that  the  judge  had  predicated  his  decision  on  an
      assumption that the couple would be  returning  to  live  in  Pakistan
      rather than considering  the  situation  whereby  the  claimant  would
      return to Pakistan in order to make an application for entry clearance
      under the Immigration  Rules.  She  sought  to  distinguish  Chikwamba
      [2008] UKHL 40 (relied upon by Mr  Thathall)  on  the  basis  that  in
      Chikwamba it was  plain  that  the  claimant  in  that  case  met  the
      requirements of the Rules and it was therefore a 'pointless  exercise'
      to require her to leave the UK to  apply  for  entry  clearance  which
      would be granted.  In  this  case,  the  claimant  did  not  meet  the
      financial requirements of the Rules. The claimant had not applied  for
      asylum.


      Immigration Rules


   7.    The claimant had been granted entry as a visitor  for  six  months.
      She sought a variation to remain on the basis of her relationship with
      the sponsor,  a  British  citizen  settled  and  working  in  the  UK.
      Although the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  dismissed  the  appeal  under
      paragraph 284 of the Immigration Rules on the grounds that  she  could
      not meet the maintenance requirements it is also correct to  say  that
      she could not meet paragraph 284 (1) (a) or (b) because she  had  been
      admitted as a visitor.


   8.    Appendix FM applies to  the  application  made  by  this  claimant.
      Appendix FM Gen is the preamble that sets out the SSHD's view that  it
      reflects the Article 8 balance to  be  struck  between  the  right  to
      respect for  family  and  private  life  and  the  legitimate  aim  of
      protecting the economic wellbeing of society. Section R-LTRP sets  out
      the requirements to be met for limited leave to remain as  a  partner.
      In so far as is relevant to this claimant the Rules are as follows:

         "Section R-LTRP: Requirements for limited  leave  to  remain  as  a
         partner
         R-LTRP.1.1. The requirements to be met for limited leave to  remain
         as a partner are-
         (a) the applicant and their partner must be in the UK;
         (b) the applicant must have made a valid application for limited or
         indefinite leave to remain as a partner; and either
         (c) (i) the applicant must not fall for refusal  under  Section  S-
         LTR: Suitability leave to remain; and
             (ii) the applicant meets all of the requirements of Section E-
         LTRP:
             Eligibility for leave to remain as a partner; or
         (d) (i) the applicant must not fall for refusal  under  Section  S-
         LTR: Suitability leave to remain; and
             (ii) the applicant meets the  requirements  of  paragraphs  E-
             LTRP.1.2-1.12. and E-LTRP.2.1.; and
             (iii) paragraph EX.1 applies.


         Relationship requirements
         E-LTRP.1.2. The applicant's partner must be-
         (a) a British Citizen in the UK;
         (b) present and settled in the UK; or
         (c) in the UK with refugee leave or as a person  with  humanitarian
         protection.
         E-LTRP.1.3. The applicant must be aged 18 or over at  the  date  of
         application. E-LTRP.1.4. The partner must be aged 18 or over at the
         date of application.
         E-LTRP.1.5. The applicant and their partner must not be within  the
         prohibited degree of relationship.
         E-LTRP.1.6. The applicant  and  their  partner  must  have  met  in
         person.
         E-LTRP.1.7.  The  relationship  between  the  applicant  and  their
         partner must be genuine and subsisting.
         E-LTRP.1.8. If the applicant and partner are married or in a  civil
         partnership it must be a valid marriage or  civil  partnership,  as
         specified.
         E-LTRP.1.9. Any previous relationship of  the  applicant  or  their
         partner  must  have  broken  down  permanently,  unless  it  is   a
         relationship which falls within paragraph 278(i) of these Rules.
         E-LTRP.1.10. The applicant and their partner must  intend  to  live
         together permanently in the UK and, in any application for  further
         leave to remain as a partner (except where the applicant is in  the
         UK as a fianc�(e) or proposed civil partner) and in any application
         for indefinite leave to remain as a  partner,  the  applicant  must
         provide evidence that, since  entry  clearance  as  a  partner  was
         granted under paragraph  D-ECP1.1.  or  since  the  last  grant  of
         limited leave to remain as  a  partner,  the  applicant  and  their
         partner have lived together in the UK  or  there  is  good  reason,
         consistent with a continuing intention to live together permanently
         in the UK, for any period in which they have not done so.
         E-LTRP.1.11. If the  applicant  is  in  the  UK  with  leave  as  a
         fianc�(e) or proposed civil  partner  and  the  marriage  or  civil
         partnership did not take place during that period of  leave,  there
         must be good reason why and evidence that it will take place within
         the next 6 months.
         E-LTRP.1.12. The applicant's  partner  cannot  be  the  applicant's
         fianc�(e) or proposed  civil  partner,  unless  the  applicant  was
         granted entry clearance as  that  person's  fianc�(e)  or  proposed
         civil partner.


         Immigration status requirements
         E-LTRP.2.1. The applicant must not be in the UK-
         (a) as a visitor;
         (b) with valid leave granted for a period  of  6  months  or  less,
         unless that leave is as a fianc�(e) or proposed civil  partner,  or
         was  granted  pending  the  outcome  of  family  court  or  divorce
         proceedings; or
         (c) on temporary admission or temporary release  (unless  paragraph
         EX.1 applies).
         E-LTRP.2.2. The applicant must not  be  in  the  UK  in  breach  of
         immigration laws (disregarding any  period  of  overstaying  for  a
         period of 28 days or less), unless paragraph EX.1 applies.


         Section D-LTRP: Decision on application for limited leave to remain
         as a partner
         D-LTRP.1.1. If the applicant meets the requirements in paragraph R-
         LTRP.1.1.(a) to (c) for limited leave to remain as  a  partner  the
         applicant will be granted limited leave to remain for a period  not
         exceeding 30 months, and subject to a condition of no  recourse  to
         public funds, and they will be eligible  to  apply  for  settlement
         after a continuous period of at least 60 months with such leave  or
         in the UK with entry clearance as  a  partner  under  paragraph  D-
         ECP1.1. (excluding in all cases any period of  entry  clearance  or
         limited leave as a fiance(e) or proposed  civil  partner);  or,  if
         paragraph E-LTRP.1.11.  applies,  the  applicant  will  be  granted
         limited leave for a period not exceeding 6 months and subject to  a
         condition of no recourse to  public  funds  and  a  prohibition  on
         employment.
         D-LTRP.1.2. If the applicant meets the requirements in paragraph R-
         LTRP.1.1.(a), (b) and (d) for limited leave to remain as a  partner
         they will be granted leave to remain for a period not exceeding  30
         months and subject to a condition of no recourse  to  public  funds
         unless  the  Secretary  of  State  deems  such   recourse   to   be
         appropriate, and they will be  eligible  to  apply  for  settlement
         after a continuous period of at least 120 months with  such  leave,
         with limited leave as a partner under paragraph D-LTRP.1.1., or  in
         the UK with entry clearance as a partner under paragraph  D-ECP1.1.
         (excluding in all cases any period of entry  clearance  or  limited
         leave as a fianc�(e) or proposed civil partner), or, if paragraph E-
         LTRP.1.11. applies, the applicant will be granted limited leave for
         a period not exceeding 6 months and subject to a  condition  of  no
         recourse to public funds and a prohibition on employment.
         D-LTRP.1.3. If the applicant does not  meet  the  requirements  for
         limited leave to remain  as  a  partner  the  application  will  be
         refused.


         Section EX: Exception
         EX.1 This paragraph applies if
         (a) (i)  the  applicant  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
         relationship with a child who- ....
         ......or
         (b) the applicant has a genuine and subsisting relationship with  a
         partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen, settled  in  the
         UK or in the UK with refugee leave or humanitarian protection,  and
         there are insurmountable obstacles to family life with that partner
         continuing outside the UK."


   9.    In order to establish whether the claimant meets  the  requirements
      of Appendix FM it is necessary to  proceed  through  the  Rules  in  a
      consecutive manner.  If  the  claimant  fails  to  meet  a  particular
      requirement of the Rules in that process, then she fails to  meet  the
      criteria in Appendix FM and  thus  her  application  under  the  Rules
      fails.


  10. The first analysis is in respect of R-LTRP.1.1. In order to meet  this
      she has to meet either R-LTRP.1.1.(a) and (b) and (c)  or  R-LTRP.1.1.
      (a) and (b) and (d). She meets R-LTRP.1.1. (a) and (b). She  does  not
      meet R-LTRP.1.1.(c) because she does not meet all the requirements  of
      E-LTRP: eligibility for leave to remain as a partner. Specifically she
      does  not  meet  E-LTRP.2.1.(a)  because  she  was,  at  the  date  of
      application, in the UK as a visitor.

  11. The claimant does not meet R-LTRP.1.1.(d) because although  she  meets
      the requirements of E-LTRP.1.2-1.12 she does not meet E-LTRP.2.1 - she
      was in the UK as a visitor.

  12. I asked Mr Thathall to direct  me  to  the  relevant  section  in  the
      Immigration Rules that stated that EX.1 was a free-standing  paragraph
      in the Rules such that if an applicant met those requirements leave to
      remain would be granted.  He  was  unable  to  direct  me  to  such  a
      paragraph. He relied upon  the  policy  issued  by  the  SSHD  on  the
      interpretation of Appendix FM but was again unable to direct me to any
      relevant section of the policy document that referred  to  EX.1  as  a
      free-standing route to entitlement for the grant of leave.

  13. The policy referred to by Mr  Thathall  (dated  October  2013)  states
      (1.0, third paragraph) (with emphasis added)

             ".....first caseworkers must consider  whether  the  applicant
             meets the requirements of the rules, and  if  they  do,  leave
             under the rules should be granted. If the applicant  does  not
             meet the requirements of the rules, the caseworker  must  move
             on  to  a  second  stage:  whether,  based   on   an   overall
             consideration of the facts of the case, there are  exceptional
             circumstances which mean  refusal  of  the  application  would
             result in unjustifiably harsh consequences for the  individual
             or their family such that refusal would not  be  proportionate
             under Article 8. If there are such exceptional  circumstances,
             leave  outside  the  Rules  should  be  granted.  If  not  the
             application should be refused.


             The two stage approach has been endorsed ....in  Nagre[1].  In
             the judgement Sales J finds that our regime of  rules  coupled
             with the Secretary of State's published policy on  exceptional
             circumstances  "...fully  accommodates  the  requirements   of
             Article 8" [paragraph 36] and "...there is full coverage of an
             individual's  rights  under  Article  8  in  all  cases  by  a
             combination of the new rules and (so far as may be  necessary)
             under the Secretary of State's residual  discretion  to  grant
             leave to remain outside the Rules" [paragraph 35]. Details  of
             how to consider exceptional circumstances are set out below.


             3.2.7 ........ Paragraph EX.1  is  not  to  be  considered  in
             isolation. It is not a route in itself, but the basis on which
             applicants with family life in the UK can be granted leave  to
             remain.....


             3.2.8 Exceptional circumstances
              Where an applicant does not  meet  the  requirements  of  the
             rules under Appendix FM and/or Appendix FM-SE, refusal of  the
             application will normally be appropriate. However leave can be
             granted outside  the  rules  where  exceptional  circumstances
             apply. Where an applicant fails to meet  the  requirements  of
             the rules, caseworkers must go on to  consider  whether  there
             are exceptional circumstances.
             "Exceptional" does not mean "unusual" or "unique". Whilst  all
             cases are to some extent unique, those unique factors  do  not
             generally  render  them  exceptional...  "exceptional"   means
             circumstances in which refusal would result  in  unjustifiably
             harsh consequences for the individual  or  their  family  such
             that refusal of the application would  not  be  proportionate.
             That is likely to be the case only rarely....."

  14. The question of whether paragraph EX.1 applies  does  not  arise;  the
      conjunctive  link,  "and",  requires  her   to   meet   paragraph   R-
      LTRP.1.1.d(i) and (ii) before requiring her to meet (iii). EX.1 is not
      free-standing but is accessible only to those  who  have  successfully
      navigated their way through the 2nd of the alternative routes  through
      R-LTRP.  Put  another  way,  whereas  there  are  two  parts  of   the
      requirements to be  met  under  R-LTRP.1.1.(c),  under  R-LTRP.1.1.(d)
      there are three.

  15. It  is  plain  from  the  architecture  of  the  Rules  that  EX.1  is
      "parasitic" on a Rule within Appendix FM that otherwise  grants  leave
      to remain. If EX.1  was  intended  to  be  a  free-  standing  element
      irrespective of R-LTRP it would have been identified as R-LTRP.1.1.(e)
      or some other mechanism of identification would have  been  used.  The
      structure of the Rules as  presently  drafted  requires  it  to  be  a
      component part of R-LTRP.1.1.(d).

  16. The First-tier Tribunal judge erred in law in finding that EX.1 was  a
      free-standing paragraph to be considered  irrespective  of  the  other
      requirements of Appendix FM.

   Article 8

  17. Broadly speaking MF (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA  Civ  1192  and  Nagre  make
      clear that the Immigration Rules as now in force are  to  be  read  as
      incorporating Article 8 of the ECHR  but,  of  course,  that  existing
      jurisprudence continues to bind the decision maker and the  courts  in
      its interpretation of those  Immigration  Rules.  Put  another  way  a
      decision purporting to be made in compliance with the Rules will  only
      be sustainable if it is reconcilable with those  legal  principles  as
      well as  the structure of the Rules  itself.  Otherwise  the  decision
      maker will have failed to  apply  the  respondent's  policy,  set  out
      above,  that  refusal  of  the  application   must   not   result   in
      unjustifiably harsh consequences such as to be disproportionate  under
      Article 8.

  18. It is plain that the claimant in this case does not  and  cannot  meet
      the Immigration Rules as set out in Appendix FM.

  19. Paragraph 276ADE considers the requirements to be met by an  applicant
      for leave to remain on the grounds of private life. This claimant does
      not seek to remain on that basis. In any event there is no  suggestion
      that she meets the requirements of the Rules in that respect.


  20. The judge found there were insurmountable obstacles  to  the  claimant
      returning to live in Pakistan with her partner. Although  in  [16]  of
      the determination the judge "accepts the evidence of  the  Appellant's
      brother and ....find[s] that he will not assist the couple" this is  a
      finding far from an acceptance that the claimant will be subjected  to
      forced marriage on her return to Pakistan. She  has  not  applied  for
      asylum. Even if she were to be so subjected there is no  consideration
      of the possibility of her and the sponsor living elsewhere  than  with
      her brother or other family members  save  to  refer  to  the  sponsor
      having a job in the UK. There is no  assessment  of  accommodation  or
      jobs other than an unreasoned  blanket  statement  that  there  is  no
      accommodation or means to maintain them. There is no  indication  from
      the determination of the level or nature of care  that  the  sponsor's
      mother requires or why the other daughter in law could not resume such
      care as she required. Overall  the  assessment  as  to  insurmountable
      obstacles is  bereft  of  sustainable  reasoning  and  on  that  basis
      discloses legal error.


  21.  Furthermore the judge reached her decision on the basis of the couple
      returning to live in Pakistan and gave no consideration to the  return
      of the claimant to Pakistan for a short period of  time  during  which
      she would be able to apply for entry clearance to the UK as a  spouse.
      Of course although the claimant does not meet the requirements now for
      a variation of leave to remain, an  out  of  country  application  for
      entry clearance is subject to  different  requirements  and  would  be
      determined on the basis of the facts at the time of the decision.


  22. The judge has failed to factor  in  to  her  assessment  the  required
      consideration  of  the  SSHD's  interest  in  maintaining  immigration
      control, the failure of  the  claimant  to  meet  paragraph  284,  the
      failure  of  the  claimant  to  meet  the  financial   and   residence
      requirements of the Rules and the failure  to  meet  the  criteria  in
      Appendix FM. She has failed totally to consider the proportionality of
      requiring the claimant to return to Pakistan for just a  short  period
      in order to apply for entry clearance. These also amount to errors  of
      law.

  23. I conclude that  the  errors  of  law  identified  above  are  plainly
      material such as to  require  that  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
      Tribunal is set aside to be re-made.

  24. I gave directions that the following findings of fact are preserved:

     i. The claimant cannot demonstrate that  the  couple  have  an  annual
        income of �18,600;
    ii. The claimant has not met the English language qualification;
   iii. The claimant was in the UK with leave to  enter  and  remain  as  a
        visitor at the date of application;
    iv. The claimant does not meet the requirements of paragraph 284 of the
        Immigration Rules;
     v. The claimant and the  sponsor  are  in  a  subsisting  and  genuine
        marriage;
    vi. The claimant's father has died since her arrival in the UK, leaving
        her brother as head of the family;
   vii. The claimant's  brother  does  not  approve  of  the  marriage  and
        considers she has brought dishonour to the family;
  viii. The sponsor was born in the UK, has lived all his life  in  the  UK
        and lives in his mother's home which is owned outright.


  25. The claimant was further directed  to  file  and  serve  such  witness
      statements as were to be relied upon.


   Resumed hearing on 15th January 2014

  26. I received witness statements from the claimant, her  sister  and  her
      husband and heard oral evidence from each of them. Mr Thathall  relied
      upon his previous skeleton argument; Mr  Smart  submitted  an  extract
      from the  guide  to  visa  processing  times  from  the  UKBA  website
      extracted on 14th January 2014 and my attention was specifically drawn
      to Hayat [2012] EWCA Civ 10 and Gulshan  (Article  8  -  new  Rules  -
      correct approach) Pakistan [2013] UKUT 640 (IAC).


  27. All of the witnesses' evidence was that the claimant could not  return
      to Pakistan for fear of her brother. (Mr Thathall confirmed, as he had
      at the earlier hearing, that an asylum claim had not been  made.)  The
      alleged fear was not explained other than that he was opposed  to  the
      marriage and had wanted her to marry someone else. It was agreed  that
      the claimant had avoided being married  to  anyone  else  despite  the
      desire on the part of her  family  that  she  should  marry.  All  the
      witnesses stated that it was not possible for the claimant  to  return
      to Pakistan for a short period of time whilst awaiting a  decision  on
      the grant of entry clearance (which according to the extract from  the
      UKBA website was likely to be somewhere in the region  of  between  60
      and 120 days) and stay at a sibling's home because her  brother  would
      find out and kill her. All the  witnesses  stated  that  the  claimant
      could not live alone in Pakistan.


  28. The claimant has one step brother (the oldest brother, in the  UK),  2
      brothers (one in the UK and one in Pakistan) and 8 sisters (3  in  the
      UK and five in Pakistan). The step brother (same father) is the oldest
      of the siblings but, it was said, was not the head of the family,  the
      next oldest brother was. The witnesses confirmed that  the  claimant's
      marriage had taken place whilst her father was alive and  he  had  not
      objected to the marriage. Shakila Bibi (the  claimant's  sister)  with
      whom the claimant stayed when she  initially  came  to  the  UK  as  a
      visitor and through whom she met her husband, said that  she  and  her
      husband were the head of her family but  that  the  elder  brother  in
      Pakistan (not the step brother) was the head of the claimant's family.
      She said that when she goes to Pakistan she  lives  in  her  husband's
      family  home.  She  also  confirmed  that  when  married,   the   wife
      effectively becomes a part of the husband's  family.   The  claimant's
      husband said he had no family in Pakistan. It was  asserted  that  the
      claimant was required to remain in the UK in order to look  after  and
      care for her husband's mother. Although medical evidence was  produced
      showing that her husband's mother  had  some  minor  health  problems,
      there was no evidence produced suggestive of the  need  for  a  carer.
      There was no witness statement from the mother.


  29. I was not provided with any or any reasonable or credible  explanation
      why, despite the father agreeing to the wedding several  months  prior
      to his death, the older (full) brother has now been able to usurp  the
      position of the claimant's husband and become the head of her  family.
      I was not given any credible  explanation  why  the  brother  did  not
      accept that the marriage should have taken place; nor was any evidence
      led or given why, the father having agreed to the  marriage  prior  to
      his death and the marriage having taken place, it was now the  subject
      of such disagreement from her brother. Nor was  I  provided  with  any
      credible explanation why the claimant could not stay with siblings  in
      Pakistan whilst  she  awaited  the  outcome  of  her  entry  clearance
      application. Nor was I provided  with  any  detail  of  the  care  the
      claimant provides for her husband's mother and why it is necessary for
      her to be in the UK; there was no suggestion that an alternative carer
      would have to be hired, or that she would  become  reliant  on  social
      services or that her husband would have to give up work to look  after
      her. There was no evidence  before  me  as  to  the  extent  that  the
      claimant's mother in law would have difficulties if the claimant  were
      absent for a few months whilst awaiting the outcome of an  application
      for entry clearance.


  30. There was no evidence from any of the claimant's siblings who live  in
      Pakistan stating she  could  not  stay  with  them  or  outlining  the
      difficulties or the reasons why the older brother does now  object  to
      the marriage or why the older brother has the power or influence to so
      object given that she is in fact married. There was no explanation why
      given that she is married her husband is not now head  of  her  family
      rather than  that  her  brother  continues  as  head  of  the  family;
      particularly since her marriage took place prior to her father's death
      when her brother was not in any sense head of the family.


  31. Applying the lower standard of proof applicable to a protection  claim
      (although the appeal was not argued on that basis) I am not  satisfied
      on the basis of the evidence both oral and documentary:


     a. that the claimant's presence in the UK is necessary for the care of
        her husband's mother either in the short or long term.
     b. That the claimant's brother in Pakistan  is  head  of  her  family,
        given that she is now married and in  the  light  of  her  sister's
        evidence;
     c. That her brother has decided, contrary to  their  father's  consent
        and support, that he does not agree with the  marriage  despite  it
        having taken place when her father was alive and with  his  consent
        and, according to her evidence, support;
     d. That her brother will kill her if she returns to Pakistan;
     e. That she would be unable to stay with a sibling in Pakistan  whilst
        awaiting the outcome of an entry clearance application.

  32. The claimant is not subject to a removal decision but Article 8 is  to
      be considered both on the basis  of  a  theoretical  removal  and  the
      decision as a refusal of leave to remain. In Patel [2013] UKSC 72 Lord
      Carnwath said:


            "55.  Thus the balance drawn by the rules may  be  relevant  to
            the consideration of proportionality......
            56.   Although the context of the rules may be relevant to  the
            consideration of proportionality....this cannot be equated with
            a formalised "near-miss" or "sliding  scale"  principle.....Mrs
            Huang's case for favourable treatment outside the rules did not
            turn on how close she had come to compliance with rule 317, but
            on the application of the family  values  which  underlie  that
            rule and are at the heart of article 8. conversely, a near-miss
            under the rules cannot provide substance to a human rights case
            which is otherwise lacking in merit.
            57.   It is important to remember  that  Article  8  is  not  a
            general dispensing power. It is to be  distinguished  from  the
            Secretary of  States'  discretion  to  allow  leave  to  remain
            outside the rules, which may  be  unrelated  to  any  protected
            human right...."


  33. The public policy of requiring a person to apply under the Immigration
      Rules from abroad is not the only matter weighing in the  SSHD's  side
      of the balance. There are cogent reasons for requiring the claimant to
      return to Pakistan to make an application for entry  clearance  and  I
      conclude it would be proportionate for her to  dos  so.  The  claimant
      arrived in the UK as a visitor. She does not meet the requirements  of
      the Rules and it was clear at the time of the marriage that she  could
      not do so; she would be  expected  to  leave  the  UK  and  return  to
      Pakistan  to  make  an  application   for   entry   clearance   absent
      circumstances such that such a course of action would be  unreasonable
      or harsh, contrary to her right to respect for her family and  private
      life. The likelihood or otherwise  of  her  being  able  to  meet  the
      requirements of the Rules  for  entry  clearance  is  not  a  relevant
      consideration - see SB (Bangladesh) v SSHD [2007] EWCA Civ  28.  There
      has been no evidence before me that could lead to  a  conclusion  that
      the proposed interference (namely her hypothetical removal to Pakistan
      from where she would make an application for entry clearance to return
      as a spouse) in the claimant's right to respect  for  her  family  and
      private life as a woman  married  to  a  British  citizen  living  and
      working in  the  UK  is  anything  other  than  proportionate  to  the
      competing public interest issues.


  34. The appeal is dismissed.




          Conclusions:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of errors on a point of law.

     I set aside the decision.

     I re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing it.
