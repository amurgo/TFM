Representation:

For the appellant:     Mr S Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


For the respondent:    Mr R Halim, counsel, instructed by M & K Solicitors

This decision follows a remote hearing in respect of which  there  has  been
no objection by the parties. The form of remote hearing was by  video  (V),
the platform was Skype for Business. A face to face hearing  was  not  held
because it was not practicable and all  issues  could  be  determined  in  a
remote hearing.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

      1. The Secretary of State for the Home  Department  ("the  appellant")
         has been granted permission to appeal against the decision of Judge
         of the First-tier Tribunal K M Verghis ("the  judge"),  promulgated
         on 8 March 2020, allowing the human  rights  appeals  of  Kamaladas
         Anthonypillai ("the 1st respondent") and  his  spouse  Prashanthini
         Kamaladas ("the 2nd respondent") against the appellant's  decisions
         dated 26 February 2018 (in respect of the  1st  respondent)  and  1
         April 2018 (in respect of the 2nd respondent) refusing their  human
         rights applications on the basis of the  1st  respondent's  alleged
         dishonesty.


      2. The respondents are nationals of  Sri  Lanka.  The  1st  respondent
         entered the UK on 11 September 2006 as a  student.  His  leave  was
         subsequently extended to 16 May 2016, first as a Tier 1 (Post Study
         Work) Migrant and then as a  Tier  1  (General)  Migrant.  The  2nd
         respondent was granted leave to enter  as  a  Points  Based  Scheme
         (PBS) family member in September 2014. The 1st  respondent  applied
         for Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR)  on  16  May  2016  as  a  PBS
         Migrant and but he varied his application on  10  October  2016  to
         that based on his long residence pursuant to paragraph 276B of  the
         immigration rules. The 2nd respondent's applications were  made  as
         the dependent of the 1st respondent.

The appellant's decisions

      3. The  appellant  refused  the  1st  respondent's  application  under
         paragraph 322  (5)  and  paragraph  276B  (ii)  and  (iii)  of  the
         immigration rules. The appellant noted that  the  1st  respondent's
         application for leave to remain as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant, made
         on 2 April 2011, indicated that he had an income of �40,495.78  for
         the relevant tax year, including �24,650 earned from  dividends  in
         respect of the 1st appellant's company (DAS IT Solutions).  In  his
         application for further leave to remain in the same  capacity  made
         on 29 April 2013 the 1st respondent claimed to have  an  income  of
         �44,787.41 for the relevant tax year including dividends of �21,200
         relating to his company. In response to a Tax Questionnaire sent to
         the 1st respondent on 24 May 2017 he provided  a  letter  from  his
         accountants (Multitop Accountant) dated 2 August 2017 stating  that
         they failed to file the 1st respondent's tax returns for 2010/2011,
         2011/2012, 2012/2013, and 2013/2014. The  1st  respondent  declared
         his dividends to HMRC in April 2016 and submitted late tax  returns
         for these years later in the year. The 1st respondent was  required
         to pay an additional �1,252.65 in tax.


      4. The appellant considered the explanation from  the  1st  respondent
         and his accountants - that they were  not  issued  tax  returns  by
         HMRC, but the appellant maintained  it  was  the  1st  respondent's
         responsibility for filing his own tax returns and  to  ensure  that
         his earnings were correctly declared to HMRC on time. The appellant
         relied on the 1st respondent's answer to question  12  of  the  Tax
         Questionnaire - enquiring whether he had checked and signed his tax
         returns prior to them being submitted - to which he  stated  "yes".
         The appellant additionally relied on the 1st respondent's answer to
         question 14 of the Tax Questionnaire in which he confirmed that his
         accountants failed to submit his tax returns despite the fact  that
         he had checked and signed them. The appellant considered  this  was
         inconsistent with the accountants' claim that  the  1st  respondent
         did not receive tax returns and that they only declared his  income
         in 2016. The appellant did not accept that an administrative  error
         led to the failure to submit the tax returns for 4  years  running.
         The appellant additionally relied on the 1st respondent's  evidence
         in an interview dated 28 February 2017 in which  he  said  that  he
         first became aware that his tax returns  had  not  been  accurately
         declared in 2014. The appellant considered that the 1st  respondent
         had little intention of declaring his  tax  returns  based  on  his
         failure to take any action to correct his errors until April  2016.
         The appellant considered that the 1st respondent's presence in  the
         UK was undesirable given  his  alleged  various  misrepresentations
         relating to his earnings.


      5. The appellant refused the 2nd respondent's application for leave to
         remain  as  the  spouse  of  a  settled  person  as  her  husband's
         application for settlement was refused and because  she  failed  to
         meet the eligibility financial requirements in paragraphs E-LTRP3.1
         to 3.4 as she failed to supply all the specified evidence  set  out
         in Appendix FM-SE.

      6. The respondents appealed the appellant's decision to the First-tier
         Tribunal pursuant to  s.82  of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
         Asylum Act 2002.  Their  appeals  were  initially  dismissed  in  a
         decision promulgated on 28 February 2019 but Deputy Upper  Tribunal
         Judge Lever set the decision aside and remitted the matter back  to
         the First-tier Tribunal to be heard afresh.

The Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

      7. At the outset of the hearing the judge indicated the joint view  of
         both parties that the only issue in contention was whether the  1st
         respondent acted dishonestly in respect of his tax  affairs.  After
         summarising the position of both parties and accurately setting out
         the relevant burden and standard  of  proof,  and  indicating  that
         account had been taken of the decisions in Balajigari  [2019]  EWCA
         Civ 673 and SSHD v  Abbasi  [2020]  UKUT  00027  (IAC),  the  judge
         considered the history of the appeal. She noted, at [16], that  the
         appeal had  been  adjourned  from  18  November  2019  as  the  1st
         respondent's accountant had been unable to attend the hearing as he
         was in Sri Lanka visiting an uncle who was unwell. Directions  were
         issued at the adjourned  hearing  requiring  the  1st  respondent's
         solicitors  to  advise  the  Tribunal  and  the  appellant  if  the
         accountant was unable to attend the next hearing and, if  this  was
         the case, the appellant was given the opportunity  to  send  direct
         questions to the accountant via the  1st  respondent's  solicitors.
         The accountant was unable to attend the scheduled hearing  and  the
         appellant failed to send any  questions  to  the  1st  respondent's
         solicitors as per the directions [17].


      8. At [18] the judge indicated that she had  taken  into  account  the
         background evidence  before  her  and  the  fact  that  a  specific
         document was not mentioned did not mean it had not been considered.
         The judge specifically directed herself pursuant to the  principles
         in Tanveer Ahmed [2002] Imm AR 318.

      9. At [19] the judge noted that there was no  dispute  other  than  in
         respect of whether the 1st respondent fell afoul of  paragraph  322
         (5). At [21] the judge stated:

             "the tribunal reminded  itself  of  Abbasi,  that  in  a  case
             involving  a  decision  under  paragraph  322   (5)   of   the
             immigration  rules,  where  an  individual  relies   upon   an
             accountant's  letter  admitting   fault   in   the   incorrect
             submission of tax returns  to  HMRC,  the  1st-tier  or  Upper
             Tribunal is unlikely to place  any  material  weight  on  that
             letter if the accountant does not attend the hearing  to  give
             evidence, by reference to a statement of truth, that  explains
             in detail the circumstances in which  the  error  came  to  be
             made; the basis and nature of any  compensation;  and  whether
             the firm's insurers and/any all relevant regulatory body  have
             been informed. This is particularly so whether letter [sic] is
             clearly perfunctory in nature."

     10. The judge then set out extracts from 2 letters written by  the  1st
         respondent's accountant dated 23 May 2016  and  2  August  2017  in
         which the accountant claimed that there had been an  administrative
         error in failing to file the 1st respondent's tax returns as  those
         returns were not issued by HMRC  at  the  time.  The  letters  were
         supported by screenshots from the HMRC website indicating that  tax
         returns were not issued for the tax year ending 5  April  2011  and
         for the tax year ending 5 April 2013.


     11. The judge then  again  referred  to  Abbasi  at  [26],  noting  the
         accountant's absence, but also that he did  attend  the  First-tier
         Tribunal hearing on 19 February 2019 where he gave evidence and was
         cross-examined. The  judge  noted  that  the  appellant  failed  to
         formulate any questions that could be  put  to  the  accountant  in
         writing in preparation for the hearing. At  [27]  the  judge  found
         that the 1st respondent gave his evidence in "a measured way", that
         he answered all questions put to him without  attempting  to  argue
         his case, and that it was apparent to the  Tribunal  that  the  1st
         respondent did not fully appreciate the mechanisms of tax reporting
         and that he had not understood the difference between his  personal
         and company accounts. The  judge  found  that  the  1st  respondent
         demonstrated "very obvious naivety" and that when the omissions  in
         income reporting were uncovered they  were  quickly  resolved.  The
         judge found that this was an indication that the 1st respondent was
         not attempting to evade tax due. The judge additionally  noted,  at
         [28], that the 1st respondent chose his  accountants  because  they
         were  less  expensive  than  others  and  noted   that   this   was
         unsurprising given that his chosen accountant was not  a  Chartered
         Accountant. The judge recorded evidence given by the 1st respondent
         that the  person  responsible  for  the  company  accounts  at  the
         accountancy firm had been dismissed because of  mistakes  she  made
         and could not be contacted. The judge noted that  the  two  letters
         from  the  accountant  were  brief  but  found   that   they   were
         straightforward  and  not   perfunctory.   Drawing   all   relevant
         circumstances together the judge found, at [29], that the processes
         at  the  accountants  firm  "were  not  robust  and  did  not  meet
         professional standards" and that there were "significant competence
         issues" within the accountants firm  that  were  reflected  in  the
         admissions  made  in  the  accountants  letters.  Whilst  the   1st
         respondent  demonstrated  naivete  this  was  not   the   same   as
         dishonesty. The judge concluded that the appellant  had  failed  to
         discharge the initial burden.


     12.  At [30] the judge repeated that there was no dispute, "but for the
         issue of undeclared income", that the 1st respondent's  application
         under paragraph 276B would have been granted and that  it  followed
         that the 2nd respondent would have met paragraph R-LTRP of Appendix
         FM. The appeals were allowed.

The challenge to the judge's decision

     13. The grounds contend that the judge,  in  concluding  that  the  1st
         respondent was not dishonest, failed to consider relevant  factors,
         namely, that the 1st respondent  had  signed  each  of  his  annual
         accounts and therefore consented to the 'inaccurate tax returns' in
         each of those years, that  he  took  two  years  before  eventually
         settling his tax return, and the  reasons  why  the  appellant  had
         previously been dismissed from employment with Tesco. Had the judge
         considered all this evidence 'in the round' she  would  have  found
         the appellant to be deceitful and dishonest.  The  grounds  further
         contend that the judge fatally erred by not looking at the evidence
         in the round and attaching weight to unsupported testimony from  an
         accountant, contrary to the approach in Abbasi.


     14. The original grounds additionally contended that the  judge  failed
         to consider whether the 1st respondent  satisfied  the  immigration
         rules on other occasions, but in granting permission Tribunal Judge
         Martin  only  found  it  arguable  that  the  judge  erred  in  her
         consideration of whether  the  1st  respondent  acted  dishonestly.
         Permission was not granted  in  respect  of  an  alleged  error  in
         failing to consider the substantive immigration  rules  as  it  was
         clear that  paragraph  322  (5)  was  the  sole  issue  before  the
         tribunal.  The  respondent  did  not  renew  her  application   for
         permission to appeal in respect of these other grounds.


     15. In an email  sent  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  and  the  respondents'
         solicitors on 30 December 2020 Mr  Whitwell  sought  permission  to
         amend the grounds. He wished to challenge the judge's finding  that
         the 1st respondent  should  have  been  given  the  opportunity  to
         provide an innocent explanation by the appellant in respect of  her
         allegation of dishonesty. The judge,  it  was  claimed,  failed  to
         appreciate that the  statutory  appeal  was  the  1st  respondent's
         opportunity to respond to the appellant's decision  and  that  this
         was apparent from the  decision  of  Ashfaq  (Balajigari:  appeals)
         [2020] 00226 (IAC), promulgated on 17 June 2020. To the extent that
         the judge took into account the alleged failure by the appellant to
         give the 1st respondent an opportunity to respond to the allegation
         of dishonesty in  assessing  his  honesty,  the  judge  misdirected
         herself. The amended  grounds  additionally  challenge  the  weight
         attached by the judge at [27] to  the  fact  that  HMRC  issued  no
         penalty against the 1st respondent,  and  contend  that  the  judge
         failed to consider the alternative  possibility  that  the  figures
         given to HMRC were correct and that the claimed earnings  presented
         to UKVI were inflated for the purposes of obtaining an  immigration
         advantage. The amended grounds finally  contend  that  the  judge's
         conclusion at [29] - that even  if  the  1st  respondent  had  been
         dishonest about his income this  would  not  have  been  enough  to
         breach paragraph 322 (5) given  his  continuous  length  of  lawful
         residence - was perverse and  disclosed  no  consideration  of  the
         discretionary element of the immigration rule.


     16. In his oral submissions Mr Whitwell adopted points 1 and 2  of  the
         original grounds and his amended grounds. He  emphasised  that  the
         judge had erred in law in concluding that the appellant  failed  to
         give the 1st respondent an opportunity to deal with the  dishonesty
         issue and that the judge was not entitled  to  treat  the  approach
         taken by HMRC as a "weighty factor".

     17. Mr Halim submitted that the judge weighed up  the  evidence  before
         her, including  the  oral  evidence,  and  properly  assessed  that
         evidence at [27] and [29]. In so doing the judge  took  account  of
         all material evidence before her.  Any  mistake  by  the  judge  in
         relation to the  findings  in  Balajigari  relating  to  procedural
         matters did not affect or undermine the judge's assessment  of  the
         1st respondent's honesty. Even if the judge had erred in law in her
         assessment of the 1st respondent's honesty, there was no basis  for
         asserting that her alternative finding at [29]  was  perverse.  The
         judge had considered all relevant evidence "in the round"  and  was
         entitled to find that paragraph 322 (5) was not engaged.

     18. I reserved my decision.

Discussion

     19. Permission to appeal was initially granted by Upper Tribunal  Judge
         Martin (sitting as a Judge of the First-tier Tribunal)  in  respect
         of Ground 1 only. Paragraphs 1 to 6 and paragraphs 9 and 10 of  the
         'Application To Amend The Grounds Of Appeal' refer to  or  rely  on
         the decision in Ashfaq which was promulgated on 17 June 2020, after
         the grant of permission by Judge Martin. Paragraphs 7 and 8 of  the
         'Application To Amend The  Grounds  Of  Appeal'  rely  directly  on
         Balajigari, which had already been promulgated and referred  to  by
         the judge in her decision, and paragraph 11 simply asserts that the
         judge's conclusion at [29] was perverse. With respect to  paragraph
         7 and 8 and 11 of the 'Application To Amend The Grounds Of Appeal',
         these could have been included in the  original  grounds  but  were
         not. No adequate explanation has been given by Mr  Whitwell  as  to
         why a renewed application was not made for permission to appeal the
         grounds disclosed in paragraph 7, 8  and  11.  The  application  to
         amend  the  grounds  was  sent  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  and   the
         respondents' solicitors at 17:04 on 30 December 2020.  Mr  Whitwell
         sought to explain the significant delay in making  the  application
         by reference to the fact that he was the first officer to  look  at
         the case since permission was granted. I accept that  this  is  the
         case, but it still does not adequately explain why the  application
         was made so  late  in  the  day.  Mr  Halim  took  issue  with  the
         significant delay in seeking to  amend  the  grounds  but  did  not
         indicate that he  was  prejudiced  by  the  application.  In  these
         circumstances I am prepared to grant the appellant's application to
         amend the grounds.


     20. The original grounds of appeal inaccurately  assert  that  the  1st
         respondent  had  signed  each  of  the  annual  accounts  and  "had
         therefore consented to inaccurate tax  returns  in  each  of  these
         years." The 1st respondent did not make "inaccurate  tax  returns";
         the issue with which the judge  had  to  grapple  was  whether  the
         failure to make tax returns in respect of the  relevant  tax  years
         disclosed dishonesty by the 1st respondent. There were  however  no
         "inaccurate tax returns" and no discrepancies between the  dividend
         income disclosed to UKVI and then (eventually) disclosed  to  HMRC.
         The tax returns signed by the 1st  respondent  disclosed  the  same
         income as that disclosed to UKVI. To the extent that  the  original
         grounds rely on an alleged failure by the judge  to  consider  that
         the 1st respondent signed all of the tax returns lodged with  HMRC,
         this discloses no basis for any error of law.

     21. The original grounds further  contend  that  the  judge  failed  to
         consider a delay of two years before the 1st respondent settled his
         tax return. The basis for the alleged  delay  of  2  years  was  an
         answer given by the 1st respondent in his interview conducted on 28
         February 2017. In his statement dated  12  February  2019  the  1st
         respondent explained that, in the interview, he could not  remember
         the relevant year and stated  '2014'  out  of  nervousness,  before
         confirming that it was in fact April 2016. Although the  judge  did
         not specifically mention this part of the witness statement she did
         indicate at [18] that she had taken into account of the  background
         evidence, and at [27] she found that the 1st  respondent  gave  his
         evidence in a measured way and had answered all  questions  without
         attempting to argue his case and that when the omissions in  income
         reporting were uncovered they were resolved quickly.  It  is  clear
         from  the  judge's  detailed  assessment  of  the  1st  respondents
         evidence at [27] and [29] that she  carefully  considered  the  1st
         respondent's evidence 'in the round',  including  his  written  and
         oral evidence, and found he had  provided  credible  and  plausible
         explanations for  the  failure  to  lodge  the  tax  returns.  This
         indicates that the judge found the 1st respondent credible and that
         she accepted his explanation  in  his  statement,  with  particular
         reference  to  her  finding  that  the  omissions  were   "resolved
         quickly". This was a conclusion rationally open to the judge  based
         on the evidence before her  and  for  the  reasons  she  gave.  The
         original grounds further contend that the judge failed to take into
         account evidence relating to the 1st  respondent's  dismissal  from
         his employment with Tesco. No mention is made of such dismissal  in
         the Reasons for Refusal Letter and there was no indication that any
         submissions were made by the Presenting Officer based  on  the  1st
         respondent's former employment with Tesco. The only reference I can
         find on the file relates to  an  'IO  Report'  dated  8  July  2014
         recalling  the  1st  respondent's  explanation  that  he  had  been
         dismissed for taking some tape  from  the  store.  It  is  entirely
         unclear whether this  was  brought  to  the  judge's  attention  or
         whether submissions were made on the point and, bearing in mind the
         vintage of the report and the absence of any  suggestion  that  the
         1st respondent was prosecuted, I am not satisfied  that  the  judge
         failed to take into account a relevant consideration.


     22. The original grounds finally contend that the judge failed to apply
         the principles established in Abassi relating to  the  weight  that
         can be attached to letters from accountants. It  is  clear  however
         from the decision at [4] and, in particular, at [21] and [26]  that
         the judge was acutely aware of the guidance in  Abassi.  The  judge
         was entitled to note  that  the  accountant  had  previously  given
         evidence and was cross-examined in February 2019, and to find  that
         the explanation for the accountant's absence was plausible  (indeed
         the appellant does not suggest in her grounds that  the  accountant
         was fabricating his claim that he was in Sri Lanka due to the  ill-
         health of his uncle). The judge was additionally entitled  to  note
         that the appellant was given an opportunity to put questions to the
         accountant but failed to do so. In these  particular  circumstances
         the judge was therefore entitled, having regard to  her  assessment
         of the two letters from the accountant, to attach  the  weight  she
         did to those letters. The judge's approach does  not  disclose  any
         error of law.

     23. I now consider the amended grounds. Whilst I accept that the  judge
         wrongly indicated at [29] that the 1st respondent should have  been
         given an opportunity to explain his position before  the  appellant
         made her refusal decision (Ashfaq  held  that  the  appeal  process
         fills the procedural fairness gap identified in  Balajigari),  this
         finding was of a procedural nature and, contrary to  the  assertion
         in the amended grounds, did not have any  material  impact  on  the
         judge's assessment of the 1st respondent's  honesty.  At  [27]  and
         [28] the judge carefully considered the manner  in  which  the  1st
         respondent gave his evidence, his action on the discovery that  the
         tax returns had not been submitted, and the reasons  why  he  chose
         Multi-top as his accountants. The judge's  assessment  of  the  1st
         respondent's evidence at [28] was particularly detailed  and  based
         on her assessment "in the round". The judge was entitled,  at  [29]
         to find that the processes at the accountancy firm were "not robust
         and did not meet professional  standards"  and  to  note  that  the
         accountant was not a Chartered Accountant. These findings are quite
         separate from the judge's observation that the  appellant  did  not
         give the 1st respondent an  opportunity  to  explain  his  position
         before making the refusal decision. Any error of law by  the  judge
         was therefore immaterial to her assessment of the 1st  respondent's
         honesty.


     24. Nor is there any merit in the contention that the  judge  erred  in
         law in considering the actions of HMRC in not issuing a penalty  to
         the 1st respondent as a weighty factor. The judge made it clear  at
         [27] that the approach adopted by HMRC was  not  determinative  and
         the issue of  weight  was  ultimately  one  for  her.  The  judge's
         assessment of the 1st respondent's honesty in any event relied on a
         number of different factors. It cannot be said,  having  regard  to
         the decision holistically, and in particular  the  judge's  further
         assessment at [28] and [29], that she gave weight to an  irrelevant
         matter. To the extent that the amended  grounds  contend  that  the
         judge failed to  consider  the  alternative  possibility  that  the
         figures provided by the 1st respondent to  HMRC  were  correct  and
         that he inflated his  earnings  to  UKVI  to  gain  an  immigration
         advantage, this is undermined  by  the  fact  that  there  were  no
         discrepancies between the  figures  disclosed  to  HMRC  and  those
         disclosed to UKVI. Contrary to the situation considered  in  Ashfaq
         at  [14],  there  was  no  "fictitious  inflation  of  income"   or
         "fictitious under-return" on the facts of  the  present  case.  Nor
         does it appear that any  submission  was  made  by  the  Presenting
         Officer at the First-tier Tribunal hearing that the 1st  respondent
         had lodged any inaccurate tax returns.


     25. The ground relating  to  the  alleged  perversity  of  the  judge's
         finding at [29] related to a finding in the alternative even if the
         1st respondent was dishonest. Given that  I  have  found  that  the
         judge's decision does not disclose any error of law  requiring  the
         decision to be set aside in respect of her  finding  that  the  1st
         respondent was not dishonest, this ground falls away.

     26. For the reasons given above I am not  persuaded  that  the  judge's
         decision contains mistakes on points of law requiring it to be  set
         aside.

Notice of Decision
