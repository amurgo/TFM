For the Secretary of State:             Mr Tufan (03.09.15) and Mr Jarvis

For the Respondent/Claimant:    Mr Miah, Counsel instructed by Hattin
Solicitors

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Bird sitting at  Taylor  House  on  3
    February 2015) allowing the claimant's appeal against the  decision  of
    the Secretary of State refusing to grant him asylum as an  undocumented
    Kuwaiti Bidoon and against her concomitant decision to make  directions
    for his removal to Iran.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  make  an
    anonymity direction, but as the claimant asserts a well-founded fear of
    persecution in the country to which he says he  would  have  to  go  if
    refused asylum (namely Kuwait) I consider it  is  appropriate  that  he
    should be  accorded  anonymity  for  these  proceedings  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

The Reasons for the Grant of Permission to Appeal

 2. On 17 March 2015 First-tribunal Judge Levin granted  the  Secretary  of
    State permission to appeal for the following reasons:

         2.   The Appellant's nationality was in dispute.  The  Respondent's
             notice of immigration decision which is  the  subject  of  the
             Appeal states that the removal is to be to Kuwait or Iran.  It
             follows therefore that the Judge's assertion in para 23 of her
             decision that no removal directions to Iran had been  set  was
             factually incorrect.  Given that the  Appellant's  nationality
             was the core finding that the Judge was required to make it is
             arguable that this factual  error  has  infected  the  Judge's
             finding that the Appellant is Kuwaiti and not Iranian.

         3.   It is also arguable that the Judge erred in her  consideration
             of the Appellant's nationality by failing to have  regard  to,
             and to  resolve  with  her  finding  that  the  Appellant  was
             Kuwaiti, the fact that the Appellant declared that he  was  an
             Iranian national in his  visa  application  form  and  in  his
             asylum screening interview and that he entered the UK using an
             Iranian passport.  It is arguable that that the Judge  further
             erred by failing to have regard to, and to  resolve  with  her
             nationality finding, the issue raised  by  the  Respondent  in
             para 33 of the RFRL that the fact that the Appellant travelled
             to the UK using an Iranian passport  constituted  prima  facie
             evidence that he is an Iranian national.

         4.   It is also arguable that  the  Judge  erred  in  allowing  the
             Appellant's appeal under Article 8 given her failure to  carry
             out a detailed proportionality assessment  and  in  particular
             her failure to have regard to the factors set out  at  section
             117B of the 2002 Act.

The Factual Background

 3. On 5 March 2014 the claimant applied for entry clearance as a  visitor,
    tendering an  apparently  valid  and  genuine  Iranian  passport.   The
    application was made to the British High  Commission  in  Kuwait  City.
    The passport had been issued to the claimant by the Iranian Embassy  in
    Kuwait on 24 May 2012 and it was valid  until  25  May  2017.   In  his
    application form, he represented that he had a residency  permit  which
    enabled him to reside in Kuwait as an Iranian national.   He  had  been
    refused a visa to travel to Italy on 12 September 2012, but he had been
    able to use his Iranian passport to travel to Malaysia for a visit on 6
    October 2012 and to the United Arab Emirates on 17 September 2013.   He
    said he was employed full-time as a decoration designer for  a  wedding
    company in Kuwait, and he had started this job  on  4  July  2012.   He
    wished to visit the United Kingdom for eight days, and he  proposed  to
    stay in the Bayswater Inn Hotel in London.

 4. The application was refused on 6 March  2014  as  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer  was  not  satisfied  the  bank  statements  he  had   provided
    accurately reflected his personal and financial circumstances.

 5. The claimant claims to have left Kuwait on 20 June 2014  and  flown  to
    the UK via a stopover in another country.  On 26 June 2014 he requested
    an appointment at the Asylum Intake Unit in Croydon,  and  he  formally
    claimed asylum on 9 July 2014.  He gave a  slightly  different  surname
    from that given in the Iranian passport.  He  said  that  he  had  been
    unemployed in Kuwait.  When asked about how he had entered  the  United
    Kingdom, he said he used a passport provided by an agent.  He  did  not
    know the details of it, including its colour.  He was asked whether  he
    had had his own national passport, and he answered yes: his father  had
    made an Iranian passport  for  him.   He  could  not  produce  his  own
    national passport today as he did not know where it was.  The  passport
    which he had used to enter the UK had been retained by the agent.

 6. At his substantive asylum interview, he said  he  was  not  an  Iranian
    national, but an undocumented, and hence stateless, Kuwaiti Bidoon.

 7. In a letter dated 3 November 2014  the  Secretary  of  State  gave  her
    reasons for refusing to recognise the claimant  as  a  refugee,  or  as
    otherwise requiring international protection.  She did not accept  that
    he was a stateless Kuwaiti Bidoon as opposed to  an  Iranian  national.
    The key part of the Secretary of State's reasoning is to  be  found  in
    paragraphs 33 and 34 of the decision letter, which I reproduce below:

         33.  It is noted that you originally  produced  a  passport  to  an
             Immigration Officer on arrival to the UK and obtained entry to
             the UK.  You did not state to  the  Immigration  Officer  that
             this was not a passport to which you were entitled,  when  you
             had ample opportunity to do so, and you have only claimed that
             it was not a passport and nationality to which  you  were  not
             entitled when you claimed asylum.  It is noted that  paragraph
             93 of the UNCHR Handbook states:

                  'Nationality may be proved by the possession of a national
                  passport.  Possession of such a passport creates  a  prima
                  facie presumption that the holder is  a  national  of  the
                  country  of  issue,  unless  the  passport  itself  states
                  otherwise.  A person holding a passport showing him to  be
                  a national of the issuing country, but who claims that  he
                  does  not  possess  that   country's   nationality,   must
                  substantiate his claim, for example, by showing  that  the
                  passport is a  so-called  'passport  of  convenience'  (an
                  apparently regular national  passport  that  is  sometimes
                  issued  by  a  national   authority   to   non-nationals).
                  However, a mere assertion by the holder that the  passport
                  was issued to him as a matter of  convenience  for  travel
                  purposes only is not sufficient to rebut  the  presumption
                  of nationality.  In certain cases, it might be possible to
                  obtain information from  the  authority  that  issued  the
                  passport.  If such  information  cannot  be  obtained,  or
                  cannot be obtained within reasonable  time,  the  examiner
                  will have to decide on the credibility of the  applicant's
                  assertion in weighing all other elements of his story.'

         34.  It is noted that you assert that your father arranged for  all
             your family to be in possession of Iranian passports in  order
             to access a better standard of living within  Kuwait,  however
             in line with the guidance above from the UNCHR Handbook it  is
             not considered that your explanation for being  in  possession
             of an Iranian passport which has facilitated  your  travel  to
             the United Arab Emirates and Malaysia, as well as the  UK,  is
             sufficient enough to rebut the  presumption  of  your  Iranian
             nationality.

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 8. At the hearing before Judge Bird, the claimant appeared in  person  and
    the Secretary of State was represented by  a  Presenting  Officer.   In
    oral evidence, the claimant said that his father had managed to  obtain
    Iranian passports for all the family.  One of his grandmothers  was  an
    Iranian.  His father had to renew the Iranian residence  permit  issued
    to him by the Kuwaitis every year or every two  years.   Any  documents
    the family had were Iranian documents.  He did not have any Kuwaiti  ID
    documents.  He and his siblings had attended an Iranian school with the
    help of their Iranian documents.  He had travelled out of Iran  with  a
    friend of his father's.  He had gone to Qatar, Dubai and Malaysia.

 9. In her subsequent decision, the judge addressed  the  question  of  the
    claimant's disputed nationality  at  paragraphs  17  and  18,  which  I
    reproduce below.

         17.  The appellant's account was not accepted by the respondent who
             did not accept that the appellant was a  Kuwaiti  Bidoon.   It
             was the respondent's view that the appellant was Iranian.   No
             evidence has been adduced by the respondent to show  that  the
             Iranian passport  on  which  the  appellant  travelled  was  a
             genuinely issued Iranian passport.

         18.  The respondent maintains that because  of  the  passport  upon
             which the appellant travelled he is an Iranian and is  not  an
             undocumented Bidoon from Kuwait.  There is no evidence  before
             me to show that this document  was  genuinely  issued  by  the
             Iranian authorities.   I  find  that  the  evidence  that  the
             respondent relies on to show that the appellant is Iranian  is
             a passport which the appellant presented when he  applied  for
             his entry clearance.  The appellant accepts that  this  was  a
             passport that had been obtained by his father after payment of
             money to an Iranian official at the Iranian Embassy.  There is
             no evidence before me to show that this is a genuinely  issued
             document or that it is accepted  by  the  Iranian  authorities
             that the appellant is Iranian.

10.  Having  resolved  the  disputed  issue  of  the   claimant's   Iranian
    nationality in favour of the claimant, Judge Bird went on to find  that
    on the oral evidence that she had received,  together  with  the  birth
    certificate of the claimant's father which had been produced,  she  was
    satisfied to the lower standard of  proof  that  the  claimant  was  an
    undocumented Bidoon and as such he faced persecution in the country  of
    his birth.  Although the Secretary of State stated he could be returned
    to Iran, the judge held (erroneously) that  no  removal  directions  to
    that country had in fact been made.

The Error of Law Hearing

11. At the hearing before me to determine whether an error of law was  made
    out, Mr Miah sought to defend the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal,
    arguing that the  judge  had  taken  all  the  relevant  evidence  into
    account, and had reached a finding that was reasonably open to her.   I
    ruled that an error of law was made out, and gave  my  reasons  for  so
    finding in short form.  My extended reasons are set out  below.   There
    was then a discussion about the remaking of the decision,  and  it  was
    agreed that there should be a resumed hearing  in  the  Upper  Tribunal
    before me to remake the decision, and that none of the findings of fact
    made by the First-tier Tribunal would be preserved.

Reasons for Finding an Error of Law

12. The reasoning of the judge discloses  a  clear  error  of  law  as  she
    wrongly shifts the burden onto the Secretary of State to prove that the
    Iranian passport tendered by the claimant for the purposes  of  seeking
    entry clearance as a  visitor  was  genuine,  rather  than  the  burden
    resting with the claimant to prove  his  case  that  the  passport  was
    false.  It was a key element of the asylum claim that the claimant  was
    not an Iranian national, but had somehow managed, in  common  with  the
    rest of his family, to pose as an Iranian national using either  forged
    documents or documents which were false in the sense that they conveyed
    a false message.  As I understand it, the claimant's case was that  the
    Iranian passport  he  had  used  for  the  purposes  of  seeking  entry
    clearance as a visitor had been genuinely issued, but it was fraudulent
    in that he was  not  actually  an  Iranian  national;  and  so  he  not
    genuinely entitled to hold an Iranian passport.

13. In accordance with general principles, the burden rests with an  asylum
    claimant to prove, albeit to the lower standard of proof, all  elements
    of the claim.  Thus, the burden rested with the claimant to prove  that
    his apparent Iranian nationality was a fraud, rather than (as the judge
    wrongly directed herself) on the Secretary of State to prove  that  the
    Iranian authorities recognise the claimant to be an Iranian national.

14. Moreover, the judge failed to engage with  the  evidential  presumption
    discussed in paragraph 33 of the refusal decision, and about which  the
    decision of the  judge  is  completely  silent.   The  claimant  showed
    himself to be in possession of an Iranian passport  when  applying  for
    entry clearance as a visitor, and this engenders a presumption that the
    claimant is a national of the country of issue, namely  Iran.   So  the
    burden  of  proof  on  the  claimant  on  this  particular   issue   is
    particularly onerous, as he has to rebut the presumption of legality.

15. I note that at the beginning of paragraph 33 of the refusal  letter  it
    is asserted that the claimant  produced  his  Iranian  passport  to  an
    Immigration Officer on arrival in the UK.  This is in fact disputed  by
    the claimant.  His case is that he presented a  different  passport  to
    that which he used to travel to other countries, and different to  that
    which he used to seek entry clearance as a visitor.  It is not clear to
    me that the Secretary of State actually has any concrete evidence as to
    what passport the claimant used to enter the UK,  and  to  that  extent
    Judge Bird may well have been right to say there was no evidence before
    her to show that the document on which the claimant entered the UK  was
    genuinely issued by the Iranian authorities.  But this does not  change
    the fact that only a few months before his date of claimed entry to the
    UK the claimant used a passport which was on the face of  it  genuinely
    issued by the Iranian authorities, and indeed it is  not  part  of  the
    claimant's case that the passport relied on was forged.  So  the  judge
    has not given adequate reasons for resolving the disputed issue of  the
    claimant's nationality in favour of the claimant, rather than in favour
    of the Secretary of State.

16. The resolution of this issue has a knock-on effect on  the  credibility
    findings in respect of the other aspects of the asylum  claim,  and  it
    also has ramifications for the proper disposal of an alternative  claim
    under Article 8 ECHR.  Accordingly, the error of law is such  that  the
    findings on all issues are unsafe, and the decision must be  remade  in
    its entirety.

The Resumed Hearing

17. It is convenient at this stage to rehearse the  claimant's  account  of
    the circumstances  which  had  led  to  him  fleeing  Kuwait.   At  the
    screening interview, he said he had come to the UK because his life was
    in danger.  He got into an altercation with a police officer  called  J
    who was holding his sister's hand.  The police officer put him in  jail
    for ten days where he was mistreated.  Then he placed him in  jail  for
    another ten days.  He was arrested again but managed to  escape.   This
    pattern had been going on for six months  since  7  January  2014.   He
    could not return to Kuwait as the police officer had said he was  after
    him.  He had told him that he was going to make a false accusation that
    he had tried to kill him.

18. At question 5.1 he was asked whether he had ever been arrested, charged
    with or convicted of an offence in any country.   He  answered  he  was
    arrested on 7 January 2014 but he was not charged with anything as  the
    police officer said he could accuse him of anything he wanted.  He  was
    placed in jail for twelve days.  He was arrested again but he could not
    remember the dates.  He was arrested on the same grounds as before.  He
    was placed in jail for three days.

19. He was asked whether he was subject to an arrest warrant.  He  answered
    that an arrest warrant was issued for attempted murder  as  the  police
    officer saw him carrying a metal bar.  He did not know when the warrant
    was issued.

20. In a letter dated 22 July 2014  the  claimant's  then  solicitors  said
    their client had had the opportunity to review the screening  interview
    notes and wished to amend the answer to question 4.1.  He had not  said
    in answer to question 4.1 that his first period of  detention  was  ten
    days, and his second period of detention  was  ten  days.   The  answer
    recorded for question 5.1 was correct.  The first period  of  detention
    was twelve days, and the second period of detention was three days.

21. The claimant attended a substantive  asylum  interview  on  24  October
    2014. He was asked about the work he had done in Kuwait.   He  said  he
    did not have a permanent job but sometimes he  distributed  newspapers.
    Other times he was a street vendor.  He had a stand.  He  had  recently
    worked with his father's friend.

22. He was asked about the level of education he had  obtained  in  Kuwait.
    He said he had gone to an Iranian school.  As he was smart,  he  learnt
    Arabic, not just the Iranian language.

23. In answer to question 44, the claimant gave a detailed account  of  his
    dealings with the police officer.  As he was going to work one day,  he
    came across someone who was dragging his sister by her  hand,  and  his
    maternal aunt was screaming as the  man  would  not  let  her  go.   He
    approached the man and pushed him.  The man fell  over  thus  releasing
    his sister and she ran away with his aunt.  The man stood up and  asked
    him whether he knew who he was and slapped him.  He showed him  his  ID
    card which showed that he was a member of the CID.   He  threatened  to
    harm him and destroy him.  He ordered him to get into his car.  He took
    him to the CID bureau. There he and his colleagues started to beat  the
    claimant up.  He would not let him sleep at night, but made  him  stand
    on his feet towards the wall.   While  he  was  being  beaten  up,  the
    officer said that there had been a  lot  of  theft  occurring  recently
    without the perpetrators being apprehended.  So he had to choose one of
    those crimes in order to give the police officer  a  justification  for
    his detention.  He also showed him hashish or a drug, saying that  they
    did not know who this drug belonged to, and therefore he had  to  claim
    responsibility for the drug.

24. During his twelve days' detention, his family did not know where he was
    being detained.  They were trying to break his pride by  insulting  him
    and beating  him  up.   Eventually  his  father  asked  his  friend  to
    intervene in order to get him released.

25. After his release, the officer threatened him that he would not give up
    about him.  As a result of the beatings and the insults, he started  to
    have psychological problems.  He could not go  out  of  the  home.   He
    could not go to work in order to support his family who  really  needed
    his support.  After his father insisted that he go out  of  the  house,
    there was an occasion when he was with his friend when the same officer
    stopped his car, and asked them both  to  show  their  ID  cards.   His
    friend was able to show his ID card, but he  could  not.   The  officer
    ordered him to get into his car.  The officer knew that he was  Bidoon,
    and therefore did not have an ID card.   He  took  him  to  the  police
    station where he was detained for five days.  After five  days  he  was
    released.

26. The third incident with the police officer was when  he  was  at  home.
    His sister had gone  out  to  the  grocery  shop.   He  suddenly  heard
    screaming.  When he went out he saw the officer with someone else, in a
    black coloured car, trying to abduct his sister.  He  could  not  stand
    the situation.  So he picked up a piece of metal and went  towards  him
    trying to save his sister.  They set her free, but  they  came  towards
    him accusing him of having an intention to kill because he was carrying
    a piece of metal.  He threw the piece of metal away  and  escaped.   He
    was so afraid that he ran for an hour towards his aunt's home which was
    situated between high buildings.

27. He was asked to give further details about his detention  and  torture.
    He said he was beaten up everywhere, including  on  the  soles  of  his
    feet.  They put salted water on the beaten spots in order to  hide  the
    scars.  This was the scars on his feet.  At question 71  he  was  asked
    whether he had sustained any injuries and scars as a result of the ill-
    treatment and detention.  He said no.  But after two weeks or one month
    he was not able to walk normally.

28. With reference to the third incident, he confirmed  that  the  officers
    had tried to pursue him when he fled the scene.  He was  able  to  flee
    them because he was running fast and going through buildings and he was
    familiar with the area.  He fled to his paternal aunt's house which was
    by car probably five to ten minutes away.  She was married to a Kuwaiti
    national.  He stayed with her until his father could arrange  his  exit
    from the country.  His aunt went to the family home  and  brought  back
    news.  The authorities had gone to his home and they had permission  to
    search the house.  He did not know when the authorities had first  gone
    to the family home to arrest him for intending to do  a  killing.   His
    family were not given a copy of the arrest warrant.

29. Before revealing that he was in possession of a copy of the  claimant's
    earlier visa application, the interviewing officer asked  the  claimant
    whether he ever visited any other  countries  other  than  the  UK  and
    whether he had ever made any applications for a visa.  He  answered  no
    to both questions.  When the interviewing officer revealed that he  had
    a copy of  the  claimant's  visa  application  dated  March  2014,  the
    claimant said he did not know about it.  He was with the agent and  his
    father.  He was not aware that he had  got  fingerprinted  for  a  visa
    application.  He thought it was for stamping a passport.

30. The interviewer then revealed that  he  had  a  copy  of  a  legitimate
    Iranian passport in the claimant's  identity.   The  claimant  answered
    that he did not know what he should do.  He was  only  going  with  his
    father annually to renew their leave to remain in Kuwait.  He had to go
    every year or every two years to renew the  permission.   He  used  his
    Iranian passport to register at school, and also to be able to live  in
    Kuwait, including being able to go to hospital.  When he had to  comply
    with any formalities and when he was asked about  his  ID  card,  after
    seeing his Iranian passport, people in  Kuwait  considered  him  to  be
    Iranian.  He confirmed that the rest of his family were also documented
    with Iranian passports.

31. His  explanation  for  having  previously  denied  visiting  any  other
    countries other than the UK was that  he  understood  the  interviewing
    officer to have asked him whether he had lived abroad.  He had gone  to
    Dubai, Malaysia and Qatar for the purposes of  working.   His  father's
    friend was a wedding contractor, and he  had  gone  with  his  father's
    friend on wedding business, such as for the  marriage  of  one  of  the
    emirs in Qatar.

32. At the resumed hearing, the claimant gave evidence  through  a  Kuwaiti
    interpreter.  He adopted as his evidence-in-chief his witness statement
    which he signed in my presence.  He insisted he was a  Kuwaiti  Bidoon.
    He had married F, a British national, at a  nikah  ceremony  which  had
    taken place in a mosque in Kuwait.  At the time of their marriage,  his
    wife's family were not present as they were not really happy with their
    relationship.

33. He had wanted his wife to be present at the screening  interview.   But
    as his wife's family were not willing to accept their relationship  and
    her nephew was in hospital at the time, they both agreed this  was  not
    the best time for her to speak to her family.  That was why he had  not
    mentioned his wife during the interview.   She  was  not  mentally  and
    emotionally stable, as her nephew had been diagnosed with cancer and he
    had no chance of surviving according to the doctor's diagnosis.

34. The only evidence he had to show that he was a Bidoon was his  father's
    birth certificate which clearly stated his father's  nationality.   His
    father had also provided a signed witness statement  dated  14  January
    2015 (this is in fact the date of the certified English translation) in
    which he stated he was a Bidoon.

35. Now his wife's family had accepted their marriage.  He and his wife had
    had a child together who was born on 8  February  2015.   Although  his
    wife had visited him in Kuwait on a number of occasions, Kuwait was not
    where she wanted to live permanently and also she  had  all  her  close
    family in the United Kingdom.  She would  find  it  very  difficult  to
    adjust to life in Kuwait having been raised in the UK since the age  of
    4.

36. The claimant was cross-examined, and he  also  answered  questions  for
    clarification purposes from  me.   He  produced  the  original  of  his
    father's letter and birth certificate which had been sent  from  Kuwait
    by DHL on 15 November 2014.  The letter from his father was typed,  and
    the birth certificate was a photocopy.

37. He was asked about his work in Kuwait, and it was pointed out  that  in
    his witness statement at paragraph 7 he had not mentioned his  work  in
    the weddings business.  The claimant thought that he had.  The claimant
    confirmed that he had distributed newspapers by car as well as by foot.



38. He was asked how many times he had been detained.  He said it had  been
    twice, but he could not recall the  exact  date.   He  could  not  even
    recall the month in which he had been detained.  It was put to him that
    he appeared to have had a  better  recollection  at  the  time  of  his
    screening interview.  He said that he had been through so much  and  he
    was trying to forget.  He had a child now.  He was doing  the  best  he
    could: the first detention had lasted approximately twelve days and the
    second detention had lasted for approximately five days.  He  had  been
    beaten everywhere with wooden sticks, and he had also been punched  and
    kicked.  He had not been able to walk for a month on his  release.   He
    had also been incontinent for the first few days following his release,
    and he was still suffering from nightmares.

39. His relationship with F had begun in 2013.   She  had  visited  him  in
    Kuwait on three occasions, but he could not remember  when.   He  could
    remember that she had visited him "during their engagement" at the  end
    of 2013.  He was asked whether she had visited in May 2014, and he said
    he could not remember.  He confirmed that their child was a "full  term
    baby".  It was put to him that his wife  must  have  conceived  in  May
    2014.  He agreed that this must be the case. But when it was put to him
    that therefore she must have been with him in Kuwait in  May  2014,  he
    said he could not recall.

40. He was asked about the visit visa application.  It was  the  agent  who
    had applied for a visit visa.  He did not know why the  agent  had  not
    used his Iranian passport to bring him here subsequently.  It  was  put
    to him that he knew he could not qualify for  entry  clearance  as  the
    spouse of a British national, so he had entered the  country  illegally
    with a view to making a false claim for asylum.  He  denied  this.   He
    did not know why his father had not mentioned in  his  letter  that  an
    arrest warrant had been issued after he left the country, and also  why
    his father had not mentioned frequent visits by the authorities to  the
    family home.  Both of these claims were made by his aunt.

41. The first arrest had been unlawful, and so it had  not  been  recorded.
    The second arrest had been lawful, and so it had  been  recorded.   The
    second arrest was on suspicion of  not  having  an  ID  card,  and  the
    suspicion had been allayed by the production of  his  Iranian  passport
    containing his residence permit.

42. His family had not complained about the harassment of his sister by the
    police officer.  This was because he  had  more  power  than  them  and
    nothing would happen.  It also would  create  a  public  scandal  which
    would impugn the family's honour.  The police officer had harassed  her
    on a few other occasions, with the result that his sister had moved  to
    live at his aunt's house in another part of Kuwait.  He had carried  on
    living with his parents until his departure from Kuwait.  He could  not
    recall when his sister had  moved  out  to  live  with  his  aunt.   He
    confirmed that the address of the sender on the DHL  envelope  was  not
    his parents' address, but was probably the address of a friend  of  his
    father's.  He did not know why the letter from his father and the birth
    certificate had been sent from a friend's address, rather than from the
    family's home address.

43. F was called as a witness, and she adopted as her evidence-in-chief her
    witness statement which she signed in my presence.  She had  been  born
    in Iraq on 9 May 1991.  Her family were Iraqi nationals who had resided
    in Kuwait until Kuwait was invaded by Iraqi forces in  1990.   She  had
    been her mother's  carer  since  the  age  of  17,  and  she  regularly
    travelled to Kuwait with her mother for holidays.  As  her  mother  had
    been born and raised in  Kuwait,  she  enjoyed  visiting  her  extended
    family there.  It was during one of those visits that F had  first  met
    her husband N.  Their relationship progressed, and they became  closer.
    N spoke to her in Arabic, a language which she  spoke  fluently.   They
    got married in secret, except that his  sisters  knew  that  they  were
    going to get married. After getting  married,  she  visited  him  on  a
    regular basis, but they were not living together as  a  couple  because
    their respective families were not  aware  of  the  marriage.   On  one
    occasion when she was with him, N seemed really down and upset.  N kept
    reassuring her that there was nothing wrong.  She decided to  speak  to
    his family, and they said that his sister  had  been  harassed  and  he
    tried to save her and as a result he was beaten and detained for twelve
    days in prison without being charged.  Eventually he was released after
    his  father's  friend,  who  had  connections  with  the   police   and
    government, intervened.  She was really upset and wanted to stay with N
    in Kuwait during this difficult time.  But she had to  return  back  to
    the United Kingdom because she had been informed by her family that her
    nephew had been diagnosed with cancer.  On or around 23 June  2014  she
    received a call on her phone, and it was N.  He  said  he  was  in  the
    United Kingdom and he was accompanied by an agent who provided him with
    travel documents which he had used  to  travel  to  the  UK.   She  was
    relieved that N was safe because she was aware of the  difficulties  he
    was encountering in Kuwait.  She had since introduced N to her  family,
    and they had accepted him.  They had moved in together, and  they  were
    currently residing at an address in London NW8.  If N  was  removed  to
    Kuwait, she would not be  able  to  go  with  him  as  her  mother  was
    emotionally and mentally  dependent  on  her.   She  was  her  mother's
    registered carer.  So she could not leave her mother and move to Kuwait
    where she had no close ties.

44. Mr Miah referred F to a letter dated 7 October 2010 from  a  doctor  at
    the Marven Medical Practice addressed To  Whom  It  May  Concern.   The
    letter was in respect of Mrs H, date of birth 18  September  1959,  who
    resided at a flat in London SW1.  The doctor  confirmed  that  she  had
    known this pleasant lady for a considerable amount of years.   She  had
    become heavily dependent on the care of her young daughter  who  stayed
    at home and was involved in the washing of her and taking  her  to  the
    toilet.  Mrs H was unable to perform these functions in  her  home  and
    found it very difficult to mobilise because of  her  chest  and  lumbar
    stenosis problems.  She was awaiting a coronary stent  because  of  her
    debilitating angina.

45. Mr Miah also referred F to a letter at page 27 of the bundle which  was
    from Dr Jalani, associate specialist in  rheumatology  at  Chelsea  and
    Westminster Hospital in London SW10.  It was apparent from this  letter
    that Mrs H now resided at a flat in London NW8, and was now  registered
    with a Health Centre in London NW8.   Dr  Jalani  thanked  the  GP  for
    referring the patient who complained  of  longstanding  back  and  neck
    problems for which she  had  been  seen  in  a  pain  clinic.   He  had
    requested a dedicated MRI scan of the spine and sacroiliac joints.   He
    would  review  her  back  in  the  clinic  with  the  results  of   the
    investigations requested today.

46.  In  cross-examination,  F  said  that  she  now  lived   in   separate
    accommodation from her mother.  The council had re-housed herself,  her
    husband and their child in separate accommodation fifteen minutes  away
    from her mother as the previous accommodation had  become  overcrowded.
    They had been re-housed last month.  She was still receiving a  carer's
    allowance for the care of her mother, and she had now begun a part-time
    job in a supermarket.  She was working sixteen hours a week at �6.50 an
    hour.  The job started last month.

47. She had come with her family to the United Kingdom from Iraq  in  1997.
    She did not know on what basis they had come here,  or  on  what  basis
    they had been allowed to stay.  In 2001 she had been  issued  with  her
    first British passport.  She had been born in Baghdad.

48. She had first met N on a visit to Kuwait at the beginning of 2013.   It
    was on the occasion of her second visit to Kuwait in December 2013 that
    they had undergone an Islamic marriage in a mosque.  She  also  visited
    Kuwait with her mother in March 2014 for a couple of weeks, but had  to
    go back because she had received news  of  her  nephew's  diagnosis  of
    cancer.  She did not have her passport with her so as  to  be  able  to
    show the dates when she was in Kuwait.  She agreed that her  child  had
    been a full-term baby, and she recognised that there was  a  difficulty
    with the dates and that prima facie  the  child  could  not  have  been
    conceived in March 2014, and she was not suggesting that the child  had
    been conceived as late as the end of June 2014.  She  said  that  maybe
    she was in Kuwait in April or May 2014, but she could not recall.   She
    denied that the claimant had arrived in the UK  earlier  than  20  June
    2014.  But she was really finding difficulty with the  dates.   On  the
    occasion of her third visit to Kuwait, she had seen N twice.   He  told
    her that he was having problems, but he did not give her any details as
    he did not want to worry her.  She had spoken to one  of  his  sisters,
    who said he had a problem with an  officer  who  tried  to  harass  his
    sister.  It was put to her that she was lying to  assist  her  husband,
    and she denied this.

49. At the time that she underwent an Islamic ceremony in Kuwait,  she  did
    not have any long-term plans.  She had married him in order to be  able
    to have sexual relations with him.  When  she  left  Kuwait  after  her
    third visit, she thought she might not  see  him  again.   Despite  the
    uncertainty over their future together, she had not thought about birth
    control.

Discussion and Findings

50. Mr Miah submits that the country information and  guidance  on  Kuwaiti
    Bidoon issued by the Home Office on 3 February 2014  is  supportive  of
    his client's claim.  Undocumented Bidoon experience  discrimination  so
    severe that amounts to persecution (1.1.2).   There  is  evidence  that
    some individuals of other nationalities claim to be Kuwaiti  Bidoon  in
    an attempt to gain asylum (1.1.9).  The latest country guidance case NM
    has set out what the key document is that determines whether  a  Bidoon
    is documented or not.  However, there are a range  of  other  types  of
    documentation that Kuwaiti Bidoon might  hold  which  are  relevant  to
    determining their nationality.  In addition, a Bidoon may hold false ID
    documents from another  nationality  (1.1.11).   Some  individuals  may
    claim to be Bidoon, however, they may be nationals of another  country,
    such as Iraq.  These individuals  are  not  stateless  (1.1.25).   Some
    individuals may have regularised their status in Kuwait by admitting to
    having  another  nationality.   The  Kuwaiti  government  treats  these
    claimants as legal foreign nationals and  issues  them  with  civil  ID
    cards.  These individuals are not stateless (1.1.26).

51. The documentary evidence indicating that the claimant falls  into  this
    latter category (the category of an individual who has regularised  his
    status in Kuwait by admitting to having another  nationality)  is  much
    more persuasive and compelling than  the  documentary  evidence  relied
    upon as showing  that  the  claimant  is  an  undocumented,  and  hence
    stateless, Bidoon.

52. The birth certificate is manifestly unsatisfactory as the original  has
    not been produced, but only a photocopy which must  easily  disguise  a
    forgery.

53. The letter purporting to come from the claimant's father is typed,  and
    it was not sent from the father's address.  But even if  credence  were
    to be given to the birth certificate, and thus to the  father's  Bidoon
    origins, this would in  no  way  undermine  the  proposition  that  the
    claimant and the  rest  of  his  family  (including  his  father)  have
    successfully "admitted" to an Iranian nationality, and thus have  been,
    and  continue  to  be,  treated  as  legal  residents  by  the  Kuwaiti
    authorities.

54. On the claimant's own account, prior to the alleged series of incidents
    involving a police officer called J, he was able to live  and  work  in
    Kuwait as a  legal  resident,  and  he  did  not  suffer  any  acts  of
    discrimination or  persecution  that  he  would  have  suffered  as  an
    undocumented Bidoon.

55. Accordingly the core claim lacks credibility from the outset, as it  is
    based on the premise that his  sister  was  a  vulnerable  undocumented
    Bidoon who could  be  sexually  harassed  with  impunity  by  a  police
    officer, because of her lack  of  status.   Similarly,  the  claimant's
    alleged unlawful detention  and  ill-treatment  in  detention  is  also
    predicated on the claimant being perceived as  an  undocumented  Bidoon
    who could be ill-treated with impunity.  Neither of  these  strands  of
    the claim is credible, precisely because the Kuwaiti authorities  would
    perceive the claimant and his sister to be legal  residents  with  full
    civil rights.

56. Moreover, the claimant's account of the alleged catalyst for his flight
    from Kuwait is internally inconsistent, and also inconsistent with  the
    account given by his wife. He has departed from the  account  given  in
    his  screening  interview  (as  amended  and  clarified  in  subsequent
    correspondence) as to the length of his two detentions,  and  generally
    he has been extraordinarily vague  about  the  timing  of  the  alleged
    incidents.  All three alleged incidents involving  the  police  officer
    were very significant  events  in  the  claimant's  life.  Even  if  he
    personally had difficulty in recalling the precise dates on which  each
    of them occurred, or the precise length of the detentions which ensued,
    he could have consulted close family members for assistance in  jogging
    his memory.  If his account of torture on the  occasion  of  the  first
    detention was true, he would have been severely  traumatised  and  very
    likely to require medical assistance on his release.  But the  claimant
    has provided no medical evidence to support  his  claimed  symptoms  on
    release, which are said to  be  ongoing.   In  his  oral  evidence  the
    claimant indicated that he had remained at home until he  left  Kuwait,
    whereas his sister (the one  who  was  being  harassed  by  the  police
    officer) had gone to live with his aunt in order to  stay  out  of  the
    police officer's way.  But previously his case was that it was  he  who
    had gone to live with an aunt after the  third  incident.  He  did  not
    mention this at all in the course of his oral evidence.

57. The claimant and his wife were in agreement that the  child  must  have
    been conceived around May 2014, but neither of them was able to give  a
    credible or consistent account of being together in May 2014.  I accept
    that the claimant is the father of F's child, and  therefore  the  most
    likely explanation is that, having failed to secure entry clearance  as
    a visitor in March 2014, the claimant entered the UK illegally in April
    or May 2014.

58. For the  reasons  given  above,  I  find  that  the  claimant  has  not
    discharged the burden of proving, even to the lower standard of  proof,
    that the core of his claim is true.  There are not substantial  grounds
    for believing that he left Kuwait because he had a genuine, still  less
    well-founded, fear of persecution  at  the  hands  of  a  rogue  police
    officer who was pursuing a vendetta  against  him  for  intervening  to
    prevent him from sexually harassing one of his sisters.  There are also
    not substantial grounds for believing that,  following  his  departure,
    the authorities came to the family home with a warrant for  his  arrest
    on account  of  the  claimant  having  approached  the  police  officer
    brandishing a metal bar.

59. On the issue of risk on return, there are not substantial  grounds  for
    believing that the claimant is, or is perceived to be, an  undocumented
    Bidoon in Kuwait, as opposed to  an  Iranian  national  who  has  legal
    residence in Kuwait.  Accordingly, the claimant does not have  a  well-
    founded fear of persecution on return to  Kuwait.  By  the  same  token
    there are not substantial grounds for believing there is a real risk of
    him facing Article 3 ill-treatment on return to Kuwait.

60. Alternatively, the claimant has not rebutted the evidential presumption
    that he is a national of Iran, and therefore that  he  can  be  legally
    removed to Iran, although he has never lived in Iran.

61. Accordingly, the  claimant  does  not  qualify  for  recognition  as  a
    refugee, and he is not otherwise eligible for international protection.



62. He advances an alternative claim under Article 8  ECHR,  based  on  the
    family life which he has established in the UK with F and their  child.
    As submitted by Mr Jarvis, he is not eligible for leave to remain under
    the partner route in Appendix FM, as F does not fall to be  treated  as
    his partner under Appendix FM.  She does not  count  as  his  unmarried
    partner, as they have  not  been  living  in  a  relationship  akin  to
    marriage for at least two years.  She does not meet the definition of a
    spouse, because they have not contracted  a  civil  marriage.   He  can
    apply for entry clearance from Kuwait to join her here as  her  fianc�,
    but he cannot make an in-country application  to  remain  here  as  her
    fianc�.

63. In any event, there are not insurmountable obstacles  to  the  claimant
    carrying on family life with his wife and  child  in  another  country,
    with Kuwait being the obvious destination, and with Iran or Iraq  being
    possible alternatives.  It is F's very strong preference not to  settle
    in Kuwait, but she knew when she embarked upon a relationship with him,
    and when she chose to  become  pregnant  by  him,  that  there  was  no
    guarantee that she would be able to carry on married life with  him  in
    the country of her choice. The only obstacle of any real substance that
    she has raised is her role as her mother's carer.  But  her  mother  is
    now living in separate accommodation, so  she  must  be  able  to  cope
    independently; or she is coping with the assistance  of  someone  else.
    Alternatively, it would not be unreasonable to  expect  F's  mother  to
    accompany F to Kuwait. F's mother used to live in Kuwait  and  she  has
    strong family connections there.   As  a  British  national,  there  is
    nothing to prevent Mrs H from returning to the UK from time to time  to
    access medical treatment on the NHS.  The fact that F's mother has been
    able to visit Kuwait in recent times with  F  shows  that  her  medical
    condition is not so severe as to prevent her  from  travelling  to  and
    from Kuwait.

64. Turning to an  Article  8  claim  outside  the  Rules,  I  accept  that
    questions one and two of the Razgar test  should  be  answered  in  the
    claimant's favour as the threshold for the engagement of  private  life
    rights is relatively low.  Questions three and four of the Razgar  test
    must be answered in favour of the Secretary of State.  On  the  crucial
    issue of proportionality, the best interests of the couple's child  are
    a primary consideration.  As the child is a British national, he  is  a
    qualifying child for the purposes of Section 117B(6) of the  2002  Act.
    But the child is still very  young,  and  so  his  best  interests  lie
    overwhelmingly in him remaining with his parents wherever  they  happen
    to be. Therefore it is reasonable to expect him to go with his  parents
    to Kuwait, if the couple decide to settle in Kuwait.

65. Alternatively, the couple face the reasonable choice  of  the  claimant
    returning to Kuwait, and making an application for entry clearance from
    Kuwait.  This will lead to a separation of uncertain duration.  But  it
    is  a  reasonable  and  proportionate  outcome  in  the  light  of  the
    following: firstly, the claimant does not presently qualify for limited
    leave to remain on relationship grounds under Appendix FM; secondly, it
    has not been shown that the claimant can be adequately  maintained  and
    accommodated in the United Kingdom without recourse  to  public  funds;
    and, thirdly, in the light of my primary findings of fact on the asylum
    claim,  the  claimant  entered  illegally  in  order  to  carry  on   a
    relationship with F.  So there is a strong public interest in requiring
    him to return to Kuwait (or Iran) in order to  regularise  his  status.
    Alternatively, it is reasonable in all the circumstances for the family
    to relocate to Kuwait.

Notice of Decision

66. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained an error of law,  and
    accordingly the decision is set aside and  the  following  decision  is
    substituted: the claimant's appeal is dismissed  on  asylum  and  human
    rights grounds.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court  directs  otherwise,  the  claimant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
