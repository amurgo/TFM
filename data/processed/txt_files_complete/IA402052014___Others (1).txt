Representation:
For the claimants:     Mr MS Jaufurally, instructed by Callistes Solicitors
For the appellant:     Mr S Walker, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The claimants are  respectively  husband,  wife  and  their  two  minor
    daughters now aged 13 and 8.

 2. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Emerton  promulgated  21.1.16,  allowing  the
    claimants' linked appeals against the reconsideration decisions of  the
    Secretary of State, dated 23.9.14 (with letter of 12.3.15),  to  refuse
    their applications for leave to remain in the UK on private and  family
    life grounds and to remove them from  the  UK.   The  Judge  heard  the
    appeal on 6.1.16.  The appeal was allowed to the  limited  extent  that
    Judge Emerton found the decision made by the Secretary of State was not
    in accordance with the law.

 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Parkes  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    16.6.16.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 21.7.16 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. For the reasons set out herein, I found such error of law in the making
    of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal as to require  the  decision
    of Judge Emerton to be set aside and remade.

 6. The relevant background to the appeal can be summarised as follows:

 7. The first claimant came to the UK as a family visitor in October  2004.
    In March 2005 he was granted leave to remain as student, along with his
    wife and children as dependants. His wife,  the  second  claimant,  and
    their eldest daughter, the third claimant, came to the UK in July 2005.
    The fourth claimant was born in  the  UK  in  2007.  Their  last  leave
    expired in December 2010. Thereafter, they have had no lawful leave  to
    remain in the UK.

 8. On 10.7.12 they applied for leave to remain on the basis of private and
    family life outside the Rules. The application was refused on  4.11.13,
    with no right of appeal.

 9. The date  of  application  is  relevant,  it  was  one  day  after  the
    introduction of the changes to the Immigration Rules to incorporate the
    Secretary of State's response to private and family life rights.  There
    has been considerable legal debate  as  to  whether  applications  made
    before this date should be considered under the old or new Rules.  This
    application was clearly made under the new  Rules.  However,  as  first
    drafted and until 13.12.12 paragraph 276ADE provided an absolute  right
    to remain for a child under the age of 18 who had been in the UK for  a
    continuous period of 7 years. At the date  of  application,  the  third
    claimant, the appellant's elder child, had been in the UK over 7 years.
    Had the application  been  decided  before  December  2012,  the  third
    claimant would have been entitled to remain in the UK, which would have
    had significant bearing on the applications of the other claimants. The
    provision under paragraph 276ADE was tightened up by  the  introduction
    on 13.12.12 of  the  present  additional  requirement  under  paragraph
    276ADE(1)(iv),  "and  it  would  not  be  unreasonable  to  expect  the
    applicant to leave the UK."

10. On 21.1.14 they made a further application for leave to remain  on  the
    basis of private and family life. This  was  refused  on  22.3.14.  The
    claimants applied for Judicial Review.  By  a  consent  order  made  on
    14.7.14,  the  Secretary  of   State   agreed   to   reconsider   their
    applications, resulting in the refusal decision of 23.9.14.

11. At the first listed appeal hearing in the First-tier Tribunal on 6.2.15
    the presenting officer successfully applied for an adjournment to allow
    the Secretary of State to reconsider the refusal decision  and  with  a
    direction of the First-tier Tribunal Judge that the Secretary of  State
    consider that the Immigration  Rules  in  force  at  the  time  of  the
    application in 2012, when the reasonableness test did not apply, should
    have been taken into consideration when making the decision of 23.9.14.



12. Following the  adjournment,  the  Home  Office  sent  a  letter,  dated
    12.3.15, referring to the statement of changes HC  820  which  provides
    that the changes, incorporating the reasonableness test,  "shall  apply
    to all applications decided on or after 13 December 2012, regardless of
    the date the application was made." It follows, as the  letter  states,
    the Secretary of State was correct to  apply  the  reasonableness  test
    when deciding the application on 4.11.13.

13. The Secretary of State's position is that the first judge was wrong  to
    adjourn the hearing of 6.2.15 for that reason; the correct  Rules  were
    applied when the decision was made  and  there  can  be  no  ground  of
    complaint in that regard.

14. However, Mr Jaufurally has pointed me to paragraph 7.4 of the Statement
    of Changes of 12.12.12. In terms, this first states that to the  extent
    that the approach of applying the changes  to  all  applications  which
    fall to be decided on or after 13.12.12,  regardless  as  to  when  the
    application was made, may disadvantage an applicant  whose  application
    made before 13.12.12, it is justified because  the  changes  "correctly
    reflect the Secretary of State's view  of  the  proper  balance  to  be
    struck under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights  (the
    right to respect for private and family life) between individual rights
    and the public interest, and of how best to safeguard  the  welfare  of
    children."

15. However, paragraph 7.4 continues, "Published UK Border Agency  guidance
    will make clear to caseworkers that such cases should  not  be  refused
    because they do not meet a new requirement of  the  family  or  private
    life Rules in force  from  13  December  2012  without  being  given  a
    reasonable opportunity  to  demonstrate  whether  they  meet  that  new
    requirement."

16. It was the submission of Mr Jaufurally that the decision had been  made
    on 4.11.13 without giving the third claimant a  reasonable  opportunity
    to demonstrate whether he met that new requirement; in other words,  to
    prove that it would not be reasonable to remove him  from  the  UK.  Mr
    Jaufurally also submitted that the Secretary  had  taken  too  long  to
    decide the case, thereby prejudicing the appellant.

17. I am not satisfied that there is any practical merit in Mr Jaufurally's
    submissions  on  this  point.  First,  the   change   introducing   the
    reasonableness test took place only a few months after the  application
    was made on 10.7.12. Had the decision been made on 13.12.12 the outcome
    would have been the same and there could have been no meritorious delay
    argument. Whilst there was in fact a delay until November 2013,  almost
    16 months after the making of the application, it cannot be  said  that
    beyond December 2012 such delay was material to  the  outcome  of  this
    issue.

18. Second, in effect the third claimant and indeed all the claimants  have
    had ample opportunity in the intervening period to demonstrate that  it
    was not reasonable to expect him to leave the UK. That is  because  the
    decision of 4.11.13 was not the last word  on  their  applications  for
    leave to remain and they were not removed from the  UK.  There  was  no
    right of appeal against  the  refusal  decision  of  4.11.13,  but  the
    claimants simply made fresh applications for leave to remain on grounds
    of private and family  life  outside  the  Rules.  They  have  had  the
    opportunity both in their applications and in  their  appeal  pleadings
    and hearings to address the reasonableness test. This point was made by
    Judge Emerton at �34 of the decision (though there is an error  in  the
    judge's reference to the date of decision within this paragraph.

19. In the circumstances, I can see no prejudice to any of  the  claimants.
    Incidentally, the regrettable and continuing elapse of time whilst  the
    outcome of the applications has  remained  unresolved  has  necessarily
    increased the length of time the third  claimant  and  indeed  all  the
    claimants have now been in the UK, which is a factor they can rely  on,
    accruing to their advantage.

20. It follows that the judge's conclusion at �34 of the decision that  the
    Secretary of State's decision of 2012 was flawed for failure to  accord
    the opportunity to demonstrate compliance with the reasonableness  test
    under 276AE(1)(iv) was moot and not directly relevant to  the  decision
    under appeal.  The judge also found at �33 that the claimants had  been
    prejudiced by the  failure  to  decide  their  applications  "within  a
    reasonably short period." However, for the reasons  set  out  above,  I
    find there was no procedural unfairness in the decision  and  thus  the
    judge's conclusion on this point is also in error.

21. It follows that Mr Jaufurally's submissions to me and to Judge  Emerton
    that the decision of 23.9.14 was unlawful,  either  because  the  third
    claimant has been prejudiced, or because the old Rules should have been
    considered and/or applied, or because there has been prejudice  by  the
    delay in making the decision of 4.11.13, cannot succeed.

22. The appeal relisted for 24.7.15 was adjourned for lack  of  court  time
    and thus did not come up for  effective  hearing  until  listed  before
    Judge Emerton on 6.1.16.

23. Before Judge Emerton on 6.1.16, Mr Jaufurally made further  submissions
    to the effect that the decision of 23.9.14 failed to adequately address
    the best interests of the child claimants, pursuant to the  duty  under
    section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009.  Other
    arguments advanced included, that it was not reasonable to  remove  the
    third  claimant,  and  that  there  were  exceptional  and   compelling
    circumstances justifying the grant of leave outside the Rules, pursuant
    to article 8 ECHR.

24. Section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration  Act  2009  (the
    "2009 Act") provides:
         "(1) The Secretary of State must  make  arrangements  for  ensuring
         that -


               a) the functions mentioned in sub-section (2) are  discharged
                  having regard to the need to  safeguard  and  promote  the
                  welfare of children who are in the United Kingdom."


    This obliges the Secretary of State to devise  systems  and  structures
    for the purpose specified.  This  duty  is  formulated  in  unqualified
    terms.  Subsection (2) elaborates:


         "(2) The functions referred to in sub-section (1) are -


             (a)  any function of the Secretary of  State  in  relation  to
                  immigration, asylum or nationality;


               b) any function conferred by or by virtue of the  Immigration
                  Acts on an Immigration Officer ...


         (3)  A person exercising any of those functions must, in exercising
         the function, have regard to any guidance given to  the  person  by
         the Secretary of State for the purpose of sub-section (1)".


    The latter is the case-by-case duty to be discharged by  the  Secretary
    of State's decision makers and caseworkers.

25. In Zoumbas v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] UKSC 74,
    at [23], it was held that the Secretary of State "..... does  not  have
    to record and deal  with  every  piece  of  evidence  in  her  decision
    letter".  However,  Judge  Emerton  found,  accepting  Mr  Jaufurally's
    submissions to this effect, that the refusal decision  of  23.9.14  was
    defective because, lengthy and, detailed though  it  was,  it  had  not
    addressed the individual rights of  the  children  and  the  impact  of
    removal on them.  At  �37  the  judge  acknowledge  that  the  decision
    referred to section 55, but considered that it did not  make  any  real
    attempt to apply the duty under section 55 to each of the two children.



26. However, it is clear from �29 of the decision onwards  that  the  judge
    was able to and did carefully assess the circumstances of the children,
    the third claimant by then having attained 10 years' residence  in  the
    UK. The judge took account of the additional various relevant  factors,
    including language, education, as well as other factors. The judge  had
    the advantage of hearing evidence from the  claimants  and  considering
    all the supporting evidence contained in the claimants' bundle.

27. Further, as held in JO and Others (section 55 duty) Nigeria [2014] UKUT
    00517 (IAC),  the case referenced at �38  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    decision, the decision maker must be properly informed of the  position
    of the child affected by the immigration decision and  "thus  equipped,
    the decision maker must conduct a careful examination of  all  relevant
    information and factors," as a pre-requisite to the task of identifying
    the best interests of the children. JO also held that it is  manifestly
    insufficient for a decision maker to pay mere lip service to  the  two,
    inter-related duties imposed by  section  55.   The  substance  of  the
    primary duty must be properly acknowledged, the relevant children  must
    be identified and their best interests must then be considered,  to  be
    followed by a considered balancing exercise.

28. In  Azimi-Moayed  and  others  (decisions  affecting  children;  onward
    appeals)[2013] UKUT 197(IAC) the Tribunal held that (i) Duties to  have
    regard as a primary consideration to the best interests of a child  are
    so well established that a judge should  take  the  point  for  him  or
    herself as an obvious point to be considered, where the issue arises on
    the evidence, irrespective of whether the appellants or  the  advocates
    have done so; (ii) Although in some cases this may require a  judge  to
    explore whether the duty requires further information to be obtained or
    inquiry to be made, the judge primarily acts on  the  evidence  in  the
    case.

29. I have also carefully considered MK (section  55  -  Tribunal  options)
    Sierra Leone [2015] UKUT 00223 (IAC),  drawn  to  by  attention  by  Mr
    Jaufurally. In that case, the  panel,  including  the  President,  held
    that:

         "Where the Tribunal finds that there has been a breach of either of
         the section 55 duties, one of the options available is remittal  to
         the Secretary of State for reconsideration and fresh  decision.  In
         considering the appropriate order, Tribunals should have regard  to
         their adjournment and case management  powers,  together  with  the
         overriding  objective.   They  will  also  take  into  account  the
         facilities available to the Secretary of State under the  statutory
         guidance, the desirability of finality and  the  undesirability  of
         undue delay.  If  deciding  not  to  remit  the  Tribunal  must  be
         satisfied that it is sufficiently  equipped  to  make  an  adequate
         assessment of the best interests of any affected child."

30. The panel also held that it was,

         "... incumbent on the Tribunal to examine carefully the  letter  of
         decision. In doing so, we would observe  that,  in  the  fields  of
         immigration and asylum  decision  making,  the  importance  of  the
         letter of decision cannot be overstated.  In the great majority  of
         cases, this is the only mechanism which conveys to the applicant  -
         and,  where  challenged,  the  Tribunal  -  the  substance  of  the
         Secretary of State's decision, the  main  factors  considered,  the
         underlying reasoning and  the  legal  rules  to  which  effect  was
         purportedly given."

31. The panel also made reference to the need to assess whether the further
    duty enshrined in section  55  of  the  2009  Act,  which  compels  the
    decision maker to have regard to the Secretary of State's guidance, has
    been performed. The statutory  guidance  is  entitled  "Every  Children
    Matters - Change for Children" and was published in November 2009.   It
    is described as "Statutory Guidance to the UK Border Agency  on  Making
    Arrangements to Safeguard and Promote  the  Welfare  of  Children."  It
    prescribes a  series  of  procedures  and  arrangements  applicable  to
    relevant decisions.   It  also  deals  with  matters  such  as  service
    development, the training of staff, effective inter-agency working  and
    information sharing.  However,  it  is  not  necessary  that  there  be
    explicit reference to the guidance, provided it can be inferred from  a
    reading of the decision.

32. In AA(Nigeria) [2016]  00106  UKUT,  it  was  held  that  where  it  is
    contended that the decision maker and/or the  First-tier  Tribunal  has
    acted in contravention of section 55 of the  Borders,  Citizenship  and
    Immigration Act 2009, the Upper Tribunal will scrutinise the degree  of
    engagement with all material evidence and, in particular,  will  search
    for clear findings in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  of  what
    the best interests of any affected child are. Article 24(3) of  the  EU
    Charter of Fundamental Rights (which essentially  mirrors  section  55)
    creates a free standing right (although not absolute) right. Where this
    right is engaged, a failure by the decision maker and/or the First-tier
    Tribunal to acknowledge it and to decide accordingly may  constitute  a
    material error of law.

33. At the time of MK, section 86(3) provided that the Tribunal must  allow
    an appeal where a decision against which the appeal is brought was  not
    in accordance with the law. That provision was removed on 20.10.14  and
    it unclear whether the First-tier Tribunal now has power  to  allow  an
    appeal on those grounds. However, in the light of my decision  on  this
    error of law appeal, it is not necessary for me to resolve that issue.

34. In MK, the Upper  Tribunal  panel  considered  whether  the  First-tier
    Tribunal was empowered to effectively 'remit' a decision to  be  remade
    by the Secretary of State where section  55  had  not  been  adequately
    addressed. Reference was made to the Court of  Appeal  decision  in  AJ
    (India) v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2011]  EWCA  Civ
    1191, in which it was held that the First-tier Tribunal was not obliged
    to make the decision in the appeal in a way which required the decision
    to be remade by the Secretary of State. After considering relevant case
    authorities, at �31 of MK, the panel stated that "in the  typical  case
    the Tribunal will be sufficiently armed and equipped to properly assess
    the child's best interests... It entails an expectation  that,  in  the
    great majority of appeals, the Tribunal will have  sufficient  evidence
    to enable it to conduct this exercise properly."

35. After finding there was no guidance in Court of Appeal  case  authority
    to answer the question, at �34 of MK, the Upper Tribunal panel stated,

         "We would highlight that where either the FtT or the Upper Tribunal
         finds that there has been a breach by the  Secretary  of  State  of
         either, or both, of the duties imposed by section 55  of  the  2009
         Act, a further assessment  of  and  decision  concerning  the  best
         interests of any affected child must be made.  The author  of  such
         decision will be either the relevant Tribunal or the  Secretary  of
         State.  There is no other candidate decision maker. We have  raised
         the question of what test or criterion the Tribunal should apply in
         deciding which of the two candidate agencies should make the  fresh
         decision."

36. The panel then went on to consider that issue, noting that  the  First-
    tier Tribunal had the power to issue directions for  further  evidence,
    and/or to adjourn or postpone an  appeal  hearing.  At  �38  the  Upper
    Tribunal panel held:

         "We consider that there can be no  objection  in  principle  to  an
         order of  the  Tribunal  the  effect  whereof  is  to  require  the
         Secretary of State, rather than the Tribunal, to  perform  the  two
         duties imposed by section 55.  There is no  jurisdictional  bar  of
         which we are aware.  It has long been recognised that  there  is  a
         category of cases in which it is open to both tiers  to  allow  the
         appeal on the basis that the Secretary of State's decision was  not
         in accordance with the law without further order, thereby  obliging
         the Secretary of State, as primary decision maker, to  re-make  the
         decision,  giving  effect  to  and  educated  and  guided  by  such
         correction and guidance as  may  be  contained  in  the  Tribunal's
         determination.  This is not contested on behalf of the Secretary of
         State."

37. Finally, at �38, the Upper Tribunal panel reached this conclusion:
         "Where either the FtT or the Upper Tribunal decides that there  has
         been a breach by the Secretary of State of  either  of  the  duties
         imposed  by  section  55  of  the  2009  Act,  both  Tribunals  are
         empowered, in their final determination of the  appeal,  to  assess
         the best interests of any affected child and determine  the  appeal
         accordingly. This exercise will be appropriate in cases  where  the
         evidence is sufficient to enable the Tribunal to conduct a properly
         informed assessment of the child's best interests.


         "However, there may be cases where the Tribunal forms the view that
         the assembled evidence is insufficient for this  purpose.  In  such
         cases, two options arise.  The first is to  consider  such  further
         relevant evidence as the Appellant can muster  and/or  to  exercise
         case management powers in  an  attempt  to  augment  the  available
         evidence.  The second is to determine the appeal in a manner  which
         requires the Secretary of State to make  a  fresh  decision.  While
         eschewing prescription, we observe that this  course  may  well  be
         appropriate in cases where it appears  to  the  appellate  tribunal
         that a thorough best interests assessment may require interview  of
         an affected child or children in accordance  with  Part  2  of  the
         Secretary of State's statutory guidance.


         "In choosing between the two options identified above, Judges  will
         be guided by their assessment of the realities of the litigation in
         the particular case and the basis on which the Secretary  of  State
         has been found to have acted in breach of either  or  both  of  the
         section 55 duties.  It  will  also  be  appropriate  to  take  into
         account the desirability of  finality  and  the  undesirability  of
         undue delay."

38. It follows from the above that if the  First-tier  Tribunal  found,  on
    analysis of the decision of the Secretary of State, that the section 55
    duties had not been adequately fulfilled by the Secretary of State,  it
    was entirely open to the First-tier Tribunal to go on to make  its  own
    section 55 best interests assessment,  provided  there  was  sufficient
    evidence to do so. However, it  does  not  appear  that  Judge  Emerton
    properly considered whether there was sufficient information before the
    Tribunal  to  make  it  appropriate  to  conduct  a  properly  informed
    assessment of the best interests of  the  children,  before  the  judge
    decided to allow the appeal in the way in which it was allowed.

39. On the basis of the conclusion in MK,  it  is  only  if  the  assembled
    evidence is insufficient to enable the First-tier Tribunal to make  its
    own best interests  assessment  that  the  judge  should  have  elected
    between the two options of either: (1) to deal with such evidence as is
    available, or manage the case so that any necessary  evidence  to  make
    the assessment is adduced; or, (2) "determine the appeal  in  a  manner
    which requires the Secretary of State to make  a  fresh  decision."  In
    choosing between these two options the Tribunal Judge has to be  guided
    by the realities of the litigation and the basis on which the Secretary
    of State has breached her duties under section 55. The judge  may  also
    consider the undesirability.

40. Considering the evidence available to the First-tier Tribunal, I cannot
    see that there was any lack of adequate information to enable the judge
    to make the section 55  best  interests  assessment  for  each  of  the
    children. On the facts of this case, the  judge  was  in  a  very  good
    position to properly assess the best interests of the children, even if
    the assessment contained within the refusal  decision  of  23.9.14  was
    found to be less than adequate. Day in, day out, judges of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal grapple with these very same considerations.

41. In my  view,  there  is  no  reason  why  the  judge,  having  properly
    identified those best interests, and being in  possession  of  all  the
    evidence, not having found that evidence to be inadequate in  any  way,
    should not have gone on to undertake the best interests assessment as a
    primary consideration in any  article  8  Razgar-based  proportionality
    assessment, as clearly the judge  contemplated  doing  at  �40  of  the
    decision. I note that even in MK, the Upper  Tribunal  panel  concluded
    that, notwithstanding having found that the decision in  that  case  by
    the Secretary of State was deficient and breached the section  55  best
    interests duties, it was appropriate for the  Upper  Tribunal  Tribunal
    should proceed to undertake the exercise itself, rather than  remitting
    to the Secretary of State. It can be seen from �41 that this  was  done
    in a relatively short paragraph.

42. As stated above, if the judge felt the  information  available  to  the
    tribunal at the hearing on  6.1.16  was  insufficient,  there  was  the
    opportunity to adjourn, issuing directions for further evidence  to  be
    adduced, or the option, pursuant to MK, to

43. In the circumstances, I reject Mr Jaufurally's submission that  it  was
    entirely open to the judge to 'remit' the decision to the Secretary  of
    State, because as he put it, it was in the range of options open to the
    judge. The judge might well  have  reached  the  point  of  considering
    whether to manage the case so that further evidence  was  adduced,  or,
    alternatively, deal with  the  appeal  in  a  way  which  required  the
    Secretary of State to remake the decision, but in reality  should  only
    have reached that point after making an assessment as  to  whether  the
    evidence then before the Tribunal was sufficient to enable  the  First-
    tier Tribunal to undertake the best interest exercise itself.

44. It follows that the appeal of the Secretary of State should be  allowed
    and the decision of the First-tier Tribunal set aside.

45.  As  is  clear  from  the  discussion  in  MK,  this  was  a  far  from
    straightforward issue for the First-tier Tribunal and  for  any  judge.
    The judge was right to have concern as to the assessment  of  the  best
    interests of the two children.  It  is  also  very  apparent  from  the
    otherwise  careful  and  detailed  decision  that  Judge  Emerton   was
    appropriately cautious and attempted to carefully balance the competing
    factors before finally deciding to allow the appeal in the way in which
    it was allowed. In my view no criticism attaches at all  to  the  judge
    who had to make a difficult decision, even though on my analysis of the
    law ultimately I have found the decision in the appeal  was  wrong  and
    therefore in error of law.

46. The scheme of the Tribunals Court and Enforcement  Act  2007  does  not
    assign the function of primary fact finding to the Upper  Tribunal.  In
    all the circumstances,  I  relist  this  case  for  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, on the basis that this is a case which falls squarely  within
    the Senior President's Practice Statement at paragraph 7.2. The  effect
    of the error has been to deprive the parties of a fair hearing and that
    the nature or extent of any judicial fact finding  which  is  necessary
    for the decision in the appeal to  be  re-made  is  such  that,  having
    regard to the overriding objective in rule 2 to deal with cases  fairly
    and justly, including with the avoidance of delay, I find  that  it  is
    appropriate  to  remit  this  appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    determine the appeal afresh.

Conclusions:

47. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

                    I re-make the decision in the appeal by remitting it  to
                    the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  be   remade   afresh   in
                    accordance with the attached directions.

Consequential Directions

 1. The  appeal  is  remitted  to  be  reheard  afresh,  with  no  findings
    preserved, in the First-tier Tribunal sitting at Taylor House;

 2. The appeal may be listed before any judge, except Judge Emerton;

 3. The estimated length of hearing is 2 hours;

 4. No interpreter is required;

 5. Not later  than  10  working  days  before  the  relisted  hearing  the
    claimants' representatives must serve a  revised  consolidated  bundle,
    paginated and indexed, comprising all subjective and objective evidence
    to be relied on, together with skeleton argument and copies of any case
    authorities relied on. The Tribunal will not accept documents submitted
    on the day of the hearing.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did  not  make  an  order.  Given  the  circumstances,  I  make  no
anonymity order.

Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The outcome of the appeal remains to be decided.
