For the Appellant:     Mr Benitez, Counsel instructed by Kilby Jones
Solicitors LPP
For the Respondent:    Mr Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Albania born in 1990. Her dependents are
    her two sons, born in 2007 and 2012. She appeals  with  permission  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Mark Davies) to dismiss  her
    protection appeal.

    Error of Law

 2. At a hearing on the 7th June 2019 at Manchester  Civil  Justice  Centre
    the Respondent conceded that the decision  of  Judge  Mark  Davies  was
    flawed for material errors of law and that it had to be  set  aside  in
    its entirety.  Since the appeal was settled by consent my  reasons  for
    setting the First-tier Tribunal aside can be stated briefly:

      i) The First-tier Tribunal erred in  failing  to  make  a  finding  on
         whether the Appellant was a vulnerable witness, as required by  the
         Joint Presidential Guidance Note No 2 of  2010:  Child,  vulnerable
         adult and sensitive appellant guidance  ("the  Guidance")  and  the
         decision of the Court of Appeal in AM (Afghanistan) v Secretary  of
         State  for  the  Home  Department  [2017]  EWCA  Civ  1123.     The
         determination records, at �59, Counsel Mr Greer's  submission  that
         she was; this submission does not appear to have been contested  by
         the Respondent's representative on the day, and I am told  that  it
         was in fact agreed at the outset of the hearing that  the  Tribunal
         should recognise her as vulnerable. It did not do so. That was  not
         simply a procedural issue. As AM makes  clear,  the  point  of  the
         Guidance  is   that   decision-makers   take   into   account   any
         vulnerabilities in their assessment of credibility.  That  has  not
         been done in this instance.

     ii) The First-tier Tribunal erred in treating as accepted fact a matter
         in issue between the parties, and  unproven  by  evidence.  In  its
         assessment of whether the Appellant is a victim of trafficking  the
         Competent Authority said this:

             "you stated you lived with your husband  and  other  relatives
             however information from the Albanian authorities  notes  that
             only you, your husband and your children  were  registered  as
             living in a property in Durres".

         That  inconsistency  was  relied  upon  first  by   the   Competent
         Authority, then by the Secretary of State, then by Judge Davies, in
         rejecting the credibility of the Appellant's trafficking narrative.
         The source of the 'information' from the Albanian  authorities  has
         never been  explained.  Nor  has  the  evidence  underpinning  that
         assertion ever been made available to the Appellant, who vehemently
         disputes its accuracy.  Given that this was  a  central  matter  in
         issue between the  parties  it  was  incumbent  on  the  First-tier
         Tribunal to make reasoned findings of fact to resolve it.  No  such
         findings are found in the determination, which simply  proceeds  on
         the basis that the matter  asserted  in  the  'conclusive  grounds'
         decision is fact.  This is an error of law. That the Tribunal erred
         in this way is particularly unfortunate given  its  indication,  at
         �23, that it had read the decision of Deputy Upper  Tribunal  Judge
         Mailer, dated the 23rd March 2018, in  which  the  decision  of  an
         earlier First-tier Tribunal (Judge Tobin) had been  set  aside  for
         precisely the same error.

    iii) The First-tier Tribunal erred in making credibility  findings,  and
         conducting its risk assessment, in  the  complete  absence  of  any
         reference  to  the  country  background  information   before   it,
         including the extant country guidance case of TD and AD (trafficked
         women) CG [2016] UKUT 00092.  Elements of the  Appellant's  account
         are found to be "incredible" and "wholly unbelievable" without  any
         attempt to set the evidence in context. Again,  this  was  also  an
         error made by the First-tier Tribunal the  first  time  around.  As
         Judge Mailer observed, had such country  background  material  been
         taken into account it would  have  been  apparent  that  there  are
         elements of the Appellant's account which are  entirely  consistent
         with the evidence in TD and AD and  the  known  modus  operandi  of
         Albanian trafficking gangs.

    The Re-Made Decision

 3. The decision in the appeal could not be remade at the hearing  in  June
    because no interpreter was available. The  Appellant  was  subsequently
    moved from her accommodation in Stoke-on-Trent to Oxford, necessitating
    the case's transfer to London. It appears that this caused  some  delay
    in listing, and in its final determination, which is to be regretted.

 4. The matter in issue before me is whether  the  Appellant  has  a  well-
    founded fear of persecution in Albania for reasons of her membership of
    a  particular  social  group,  viz  women  who  have  been   trafficked
    (paragraph 20 of the  Respondent's  refusal  letter  accepts  that  the
    Appellant is a member of this group). The burden lies on the  Appellant
    and the standard of proof,  in  respect  of  all  matters,  is  one  of
    'reasonable  likelihood':  DC  (trafficking:  protection/human   rights
    appeals) Albania [2019]  UKUT  00351  (IAC).   The  applicable  country
    guidance remains TD and AD (supra).    I  am  also  asked  to  consider
    whether the refusal to grant her leave is an unlawful decision  per  s6
    of the Human Rights Act 1998.  It is for the Appellant to prove,  on  a
    balance of probabilities, that she has Article 8 rights in this country
    capable of engaging the Convention; after that it is for the Respondent
    to demonstrate that the interference with those rights is proportionate
    and lawful.

 5. I find that the Appellant is a vulnerable witness. I  so  find  because
    she has been diagnosed with chronic daily headache syndrome, depression
    and anxiety, all of which could impact upon her  court  experience  and
    her ability to give clear evidence.   I have taken those  matters  into
    account in my assessment of all of the evidence.

    The Evidence

 6. The Appellant's case is as follows.

 7. In 2006 she was married, upon the arrangement of the two families, to a
    man I shall refer to here as H. He is the father of the Appellant's two
    eldest children.  It was not a happy marriage. H  was  abusive  towards
    the Appellant and was frequently away  abroad,  leaving  her  with  his
    family members in Durres. She lived with H's parents and four brothers.
     The family were supported by state subsidy; they had two cows and some
    land.  She describes her in-laws as "fanatics" who  subjected  her  and
    her children to abuse.

 8. The Appellant last saw H in January  2013  when  he  left  Albania  for
    Greece, where he travelled frequently to  work  in  construction.   The
    Appellant was very unhappy being left with her in-laws.  They  did  not
    treat her well and would undermine her by saying bad things  about  her
    to her sons. Sometimes one of them would tell her that her husband  had
    another family in Greece and that he would leave her.   One day after H
    had left Albania a friend in the neighbourhood told the Appellant  that
    a man she knew had been asking about her. He had seen her  in  a  local
    shop and said that he liked her.  He would have a coffee in  this  shop
    so that he could see  her  when  she  was  doing  her  shopping.    The
    Appellant and her friend were in this shop with this man, whom I  shall
    refer to as T, approached. He spoke with the  Appellant  and  told  her
    that the rumours about her husband having another family in Greece were
    true. He said that he liked her, and that she shouldn't stay  with  her
    husband. He said that he would get the Appellant and her sons somewhere
    safe.  The Appellant was upset and started crying.  When  she  returned
    home she was still crying. An argument erupted - her  friend  told  the
    Appellant's in-laws what they had heard about H and H's father ended up
    punching the Appellant in the face, demanding to know why she had  been
    out for so long.

 9. One week later the Appellant took her children and their belongings and
    left her family home. They met with T who took them in a car  somewhere
    outside of Durres.  It was night when they arrived at a detached  house
    in a run-down area. The property had 4 rooms. There were a lot of young
    girls in one.  T introduced one of these girls as Merita. He said  that
    she was his sister, and that she would help look after the  Appellant's
    children.  That night the Appellant and her sons stayed on their own in
    one of the bedrooms in that house.  After a couple of nights T told the
    Appellant that he and she would go out to celebrate the start of summer
    - it's a festival in Albania on the 14th March.  They went  to  another
    house with  lots  of  young  people  drinking.  T  gave  the  Appellant
    alcoholic drinks which she wasn't used t. They were  there  'til  about
    3am. T said that a friend of his was coming back to stay at  the  house
    and that they would give this guy a lift.  The  Appellant  saw  nothing
    unusual in that. When she got back to the place that they were  staying
    she was tired out. T said that he was going out to buy some cigarettes.
    She went to her room and lay down on a bed but then she  saw  the  door
    open. She went to get up thinking that it was T, but it was his friend.
    This man came in, put his hand over her mouth, and raped her.

10. The Appellant said that she cried all night and all the next  day.  She
    thought that her world had ended. The next evening T came back and  she
    told him what happened. Instead of being angry with his friend T became
    angry with the Appellant. He said that it was her fault  and  that  she
    would have to "pay" for what she had done.  He said that she would have
    do work for him - by work he meant prostitution.  The Appellant  begged
    T - she said that she would do anything else but not that. She  refused
    to eat. For about a week this  went  on  -  the  Appellant  crying  and
    begging T but he was ruthless in his response. At one point he hit  her
    in the face causing her nose and mouth to bleed. During this  time  the
    children were being kept in another house with  Merita.   I  note  that
    when giving this part of her account  to  the  officer  at  her  asylum
    interview the Appellant was crying; she was given a  break  for  a  few
    minutes before continuing.

11. Eventually  the  torture  broke  the  Appellant  down,  who  seeing  no
    alternative to T's demands, agreed. Her first client arrived about  two
    weeks later.  During the day she would be with her children,  and  then
    at night they would go with Merita and the Appellant would  be  put  to
    work. She cannot remember how many men came and went.   Sometimes  they
    paid her and sometimes they paid T directly.  If the money  was  handed
    to her she would give it to T. If they paid her a tip  she  would  keep
    this and hide it in her clothes.  In her asylum interview the Appellant
    said that sometimes T would go out and that it would just  be  her  and
    the girls in the house but she never tried to run because they had  her
    children - she could not go without them.  The girls in the house  told
    her that T had connections with the police and  that  it  was  no  good
    trying to seek help.  T told her that if she tried to run he would kill
    her children.  It was this  threat  that  stopped  the  Appellant  from
    taking her own life, which she thought about on a number of  occasions.
     The Appellant estimates that she was kept in that house working for  T
    between sometime at the end of March 2013 and October/November 2015.

12. In the early winter of 2015 T told the Appellant  that  they  would  be
    going to France. She refused to go without her  children  so  she,  the
    children, Merita and T all flew to France. She does not know the  exact
    dates but she thinks that she was in France for about one month. During
    that time she was again forced to work as a prostitute.  She  overheard
    a conversation between T and Merita where he said that things were  not
    going as well as he had hoped. The  Appellant  was  not  making  enough
    money so T decided that they should all return to Albania.

13. Although there have been some inconsistencies in the evidence about how
    the Appellant got to France (for which see below) she has  consistently
    described being taken back to Albania with her children in a  car  with
    Merita and T.  She believes that that journey took place at the end  of
    November 2015. She said that it was cold and raining. The children  had
    temperatures so she asked  if  they  could  stop  at  a  pharmacy.  The
    Appellant states that normally Merita would follow her into a shop, but
    just as they reached the pharmacy Merita's phone  rang.  The  Appellant
    was therefore permitted to enter the  pharmacy  with  her  children  on
    their own. T and Merita remained in  the  car  outside.  The  Appellant
    describes how the pharmacy had two doors, one on each side of the shop.
    The car  was  parked  outside  one;  having  entered  through  it,  the
    Appellant and the children ran out of the other. Outside  there  was  a
    taxi rank. The Appellant and the children got in the taxi and told  the
    driver to take them to the university. The Appellant's  hope  was  that
    she would there be able to find her sister there.

14. The Appellant did find her sister, who was  a  student.  The  Appellant
    told her sister what had happened and her sister  was  in  shock:  "she
    felt bad. How could you end up like this she said".   Her  sister  said
    that the best thing she could do would be to leave the  country.    Her
    sister had a friend who made the arrangements.  The  children  and  the
    Appellant left Albania, and travelled across Europe, in a lorry.

15. Since the Appellant arrived in this country she has had another  child.
    She describes the circumstances in which she came to be pregnant in  an
    additional witness statement.  She states that in February 2019 she was
    feeling very isolated and depressed. Some of the other women she  lived
    with in her NASS accommodation were going out and they invited her. She
    decided to go along: it was to a nightclub in Stoke-on-Trent.   She got
    very drunk and lost control. She met a man and ended up having sex with
    him in the toilets of the club. She found out  that  she  was  pregnant
    about two months later - she had no further contact with the father and
    he has no idea that he has a child.

16. Two additional witnesses attended the hearing. Both are Albanian  women
    who met the Appellant in NASS accommodation over the years.  They  have
    both been recognised as refugees. Witness 1 lived  with  the  Appellant
    for about a month in south London in 2016. After that  they  stayed  in
    regular contact by telephone.   Witness 1  avers  that  she  has  never
    known the Appellant to be in touch with  her  husband;  she  has  never
    heard a man's voice in the background and she knows  how  stressed  the
    Appellant was after she became pregnant.  She has  not  spoken  to  the
    Appellant about the detail of her claim, she believes the Appellant had
    problems with her family and husband.    Witness 2 also lived with  the
    Appellant for about a month  in  2016.    She  has  stayed  in  regular
    telephone contact with the Appellant and  also  visited  her  when  she
    lived in Stoke. She did not tell the Appellant she was coming  and  saw
    no sign of any man in the  accommodation.  She  knows  the  Appellant's
    children well and has never heard them mention their father. Witness  2
    confirmed that it is her belief  that  the  Appellant  has  suffered  a
    similar trauma to her: asked to clarify what that trauma was  she  said
    that it was trafficking related.

17. Finally, the Appellant avers that since her arrival in this country she
    has been 'disowned' by her family, including her sister.  Asked in oral
    evidence to expand on this evidence the Appellant  confirmed  that  she
    has had no contact with her sister since the day that she left  Albania
    in 2015.  She has made no attempt to contact her, or to try  and  repay
    the money spent by her sister's friend in getting her and the  children
    out of Albania. Her sister has not tried to contact her to ask for  the
    money. The Appellant did not try to let her sister know that  they  had
    arrived safely. She said that when she was in Albania her  family  were
    not particularly interested in her  life  so  there  is  no  reason  to
    suppose they would be now. The Appellant states  that  feels  she  must
    look forward for her children's sake.

    Discussion and Findings

18. My first task is to assess whether it is  reasonably  likely  that  the
    Appellant's account of past persecution in true. Mr Melvin points to  a
    number of difficulties with her evidence to submit  that  even  on  the
    lower standard of proof, the Appellant should not be believed.   I have
    had regard to his submissions, and to those of Ms Benitez.  I have also
    taken into account the guidance in TD and AD and  the  general  country
    background material about the way that traffickers operate in Albania.

19. I remind myself that the  standard  of  proof  is  relatively  low.   I
    confirm that I have considered all of the evidence in  the  round,  and
    that I have borne in  mind  at  all  times  that  the  Appellant  is  a
    vulnerable witness.  I have given due weight to the negative  Competent
    Authority 'conclusive grounds' decision.

20. In the respective submissions of the parties I find two competing  case
    theories. Ms Benitez asks me to find that the Appellant is a victim  of
    trafficking whose confusion in respect of some elements of her  account
    arises from her trauma.  Mr Melvin by contrast asks me to find that the
    entire account is a fabrication designed  to  facilitate  the  family's
    migration to the United Kingdom. He asks that I place particular weight
    on the UKBA records showing H's  attempt  to  enter  the  country.  The
    inference I am asked to draw is that the Appellant and her husband  are
    still together and that he too is in this country.

21. I begin by considering whether  the  account  is  generally  plausible.
    Having had regard to the country background  material  I  am  satisfied
    that in large part, it is. In particular I do not agree with  Competent
    Authority analysis that there was anything odd in the delay between the
    passports being obtained and the flight to France. Nor do I consider it
    implausible that T  also  took  charge  of  the  Appellant's  children.
    Although  it  is  somewhat  unusual,  it  fits  with  the  pattern   of
    traffickers using threats against family to  control  women.       That
    the account is largely plausible adds weight to the Appellant's claim.

22. I next consider the level of detail that the  Appellant  has  given.  I
    found much of  her  evidence  to  be  compelling  and  persuasive.  For
    instance, in her description of how she argued with her in-laws and was
    punched by her father-in-law her evidence was specific, and clear. Much
    of the evidence  recorded  in  her  asylum  interview,  and  subsequent
    witness statements, has the 'ring of truth' about it.

23. I accept as credible the evidence of the two witnesses who spoke on the
    Appellant's behalf. I have no reason to reject their evidence that they
    believe the Appellant to be single, and that neither have any reason to
    believe that she is in  contact  with  her  husband.   I  accept  their
    evidence that as friends they  are  worried  about  the  Appellant,  in
    respect of her mental wellbeing and in respect of her fear of returning
    to Albania.

24. I have further given some weight to the Appellant's demeanour.  I  note
    that the asylum interview had to  be  stopped  because  in  giving  her
    account of rape,  the Appellant became too distressed to  continue.  In
    her evidence before me she also  became  tearful.  That  the  Appellant
    became upset in this way is consistent with her account; it is  further
    consistent with the medical evidence that she has  successfully  sought
    psychological support in the form of counselling.

25. Some of the discrepancies identified by  the  Respondent  take  nothing
    away from the Appellant's claim. For instance,  I attach absolutely  no
    weight to the fact that the Appellant has not been able to  give  clear
    dates: there is no material inconsistency in her saying that  she  flew
    to France in November 2013 when in fact the date of departure was  27th
    October.  Nor am I persuaded that her evidence about who she lives with
    is materially undermined  by  the  Albanian  records  obtained  by  the
    Respondent. The Appellant says that she lived with her husband and  his
    family; the 'family book' eventually produced by the Respondent (at the
    hearing before me) says that she, the children and H lived together  in
    their own house.  In the absence of evidence about  how  accurate  that
    record is I am not prepared to rely upon it. It may be,  for  instance,
    that the family book simply reflects the nuclear unit. The  Appellant's
    evidence that she moved to live - in the apartment above - her  in-laws
    after marriage is also  consistent  with  societal  norms  in  northern
    Albania.  The Respondent and the Competent Authority both held  against
    the Appellant the fact that  her  husband  mentioned  working  for  the
    betterment of his 'family' when he was encountered trying to enter  the
    United Kingdom illegally in 2014. I attach no weight  to  this  matter.
    As the Appellant points out, he has family other than her (his  parents
    etc in Durres;  possibly  another  partner  and  children  in  Greece).
    Finally I am not prepared to reject the Appellant's  account  that  she
    was driven back into Albania because there are no official  records  of
    that journey:  it is quite likely that  traffickers  would  use  routes
    which they knew they could pass without a trace.

26. Before drawing negative conclusions on the evidence I have  once  again
    reminded myself that for the purpose of this appeal the Appellant is  a
    vulnerable witness and that all of her evidence  must  be  assessed  in
    light of her mental health issues, and her  assertion  that  she  is  a
    victim of trafficking. Specifically I have considered whether trauma or
    depression might impact upon her ability to clearly recall  the  matter
    in question. Even taking those matters into account I am satisfied that
    there are some material discrepancies in the Appellant's account  which
    must detract from her overall credibility.

27. There is a  material  inconsistency  in  the  evidence  about  how  the
    Appellant and her children got to France in late  2015.  We  now  know,
    from checks conducted by the Respondent, that the Appellant  flew  with
    her children direct from Tirana  to  Paris.   At  Q179  of  her  asylum
    interview she was asked "How did you leave ALB to go to FRA?" to  which
    she replied "we left the house and we  went  by  car  all  the  way  to
    France". Ms Benitez asked me to accept the evidence in the  Appellant's
    witness statement that this was a misunderstanding  and  that  in  that
    reply the Appellant was in fact describing her journey back to Albania.
      I have considered that explanation, but am unable to accept it.  That
    is because it is clear from the context, and the questions that follow,
    which journey she is being asked about. For instance the question  that
    immediately follows was "did you use documents to travel  to  FRA";  at
    Q190 the Appellant was asked how long the journey  "to  FRA"  took;  at
    Q192 she is asked "where in FRA" she arrived; at  Q199  she  was  asked
    what happened when she arrived "in FRA". Having been repeatedly alerted
    to the fact that she was being asked about the journey to France  I  am
    unable to accept that the Appellant  misunderstood.    I  further  note
    that at Q238 she is asked "how did you travel  from  FRA  to  ALB?"  to
    which she replied "by car again" (my emphasis). Taking a flight out  of
    your country  of  origin  for  the  first  time,  and  getting  through
    immigration control at a French airport, is not likely  something  that
    the Appellant  could  have  forgotten.  I  am  satisfied  that  in  her
    responses to the officer the Appellant deliberately sought  to  conceal
    the fact that she flew with her children to France in October 2015.

28. This leads me to the next issue arising in respect of this part of  the
    account. The Appellant has consistently  stated  that  T  obtained  the
    passports for  her  and  her  children.   At  Q181-188  of  her  asylum
    interview record she states that she and the children were taken to the
    passport office on one occasion, to make the application. She  did  not
    try and alert anyone in the office because she could tell  by  the  way
    that T was talking to the passport office staff that they were  working
    with T.   She is clear that it was only on one  occasion:  "one  day  I
    went there" [Q182] and "only this day he took us" [Q186].  In her  oral
    evidence before me the Appellant equivocated on this point:

         Q.   Were kids with you at passport office in Tirana

         A.   When I applied or picked them up?




         Q.   Either time

      A. When we applied yes they were with me - we needed to  take  photos.
         When we picked them up they were not with me.




         Q.   So you went to the passport office twice?

         A.   No the person picked me up not me. The  first  time  when  the
         application was made me the children Merita and  [T]  went.  Photos
         were to be  taken.  Mine  and  childrens.  When  the  passport  was
         released nor me or the children were present.

29. Although the Appellant eventually reverted to the account that she  had
    given  at  her  asylum  interview,  I   cannot   overlook   the   clear
    inconsistency in the Appellant twice indicating that she  attended  the
    passport office on two occasions.  Her evidence about how the passports
    were obtained, and how she and the children travelled on them, has been
    less than clear. No satisfactory explanation has been offered as to how
    T would have obtained the  documents  necessary  from  the  Appellant's
    husband and/or the proxy enabling them to  travel.  The  Appellant  has
    stated that she did  not  know  where  she  was  staying  whilst  being
    trafficked in Albania, but under cross-examination, however, it  became
    clear that she must have known that she was in Tirana. Not only did she
    hear that mentioned, but was on her account taken from the house to the
    passport office in a car during the day, when it would have been  quite
    evident that she was in the capital.

30. There are also elements of the Appellant's account  which  I  have  not
    found to be plausible.

31. The Appellant states that she decided to run away with T  after  having
    only met him once, in a  shop  whilst  she  was  buying  vegetables.  I
    appreciate that a woman in an unhappy  marriage,  subject  to  domestic
    abuse and humiliation, is more likely to throw caution to the wind when
    planning her escape, but I find it very hard to believe, even  applying
    the lower standard of proof,  that she  would  have  put  her  children
    under the control of a man she had met once before and  knew  virtually
    nothing about.

32. The Appellant states that her family have disowned  her  and  that  she
    would receive no support from them should she return to Albania. I have
    considered the general background  evidence  on  social  convention  in
    Albania (see for instance in TD and AD) and  I  accept  that  for  very
    conservative, uneducated families in Northern Albania it  is  the  norm
    for women to become the 'property' of their husband and his family upon
    marriage. As such I would be prepared to accept  that  the  Appellant's
    parents might reject her if they became aware that  she  had  left  her
    husband or that she had become 'kurva', that is to say 'tainted' by her
    trafficking experience.  Although the Appellant has offered next to  no
    detail about her relationship  with  her  parents,  in  light  of  this
    country background information I am  prepared  to  accept  that  it  is
    possible that this relationship could now be severed or strained.  What
    I am unable to understand is the Appellant's evidence about her sister.
    First, no credible explanation is given about how  the  Appellant  knew
    where to find her sister when she jumped in that cab in November  2015.
    On her evidence she had been in the hands of  traffickers  since  March
    2013, during which time she had no contact with anyone, and yet she was
    able to find her sister, without any difficulty, somewhere  on  campus.
    Second, it is the Appellant's evidence that a man  she  had  never  met
    before, her  sister's  friend,  arranged  her  illegal  departure  from
    Albania and paid smugglers the not unsubstantial 'fare' for her and the
    children to cross Europe and get to the  United  Kingdom.  No  credible
    explanation is offered as to why  this  man  would  do  this,  with  no
    arrangement for the Appellant to stay in  touch,  or  ever  repay  this
    large sum of money.  Third, the Appellant  states  that  after  all  of
    that, she and her sister made no arrangement to stay in touch.   It  is
    simply not plausible that a woman  would  load  her  sister  and  young
    nephews into the back of a lorry and not want to know that they arrived
    at their destination safely.  I  do  not  accept,  even  on  the  lower
    standard of proof, that the Appellant has lost contact with her  sister
    or has in some way become estranged from her. If her sister  was  going
    to cut the Appellant off because she had been trafficked, she would not
    have asked her friend to pay (what is generally) a substantial  sum  of
    money to people smugglers in order to keep her safe.

33. Pulling all of this together  I  suspect  that  some  elements  of  the
    Appellant's claim may be true: her emotional response,  her  depression
    and anxiety, the evidence of her friends and her own detailed testimony
    are indicators of that. Something has plainly happened to this woman to
    make her fearful and upset. She has not however demonstrated that  this
    account is true.    This  account  contains  significant  discrepancies
    which go to the core claim of trafficking.  For  the  reasons  set  out
    above I do not accept as reasonably likely her account of running  away
    with T, being transported by him  to  France,  or  any  aspect  of  her
    sister's involvement.  It  follows  that  I  do  not  accept  that  the
    Appellant  has  demonstrated  that  she  left  her   husband   in   the
    circumstances described, was a victim of trafficking by T, or that  she
    has lost contact with her sister.   Her sister has assisted  her  once,
    and there is no reason why, upon the Appellant's return to Tirana,  she
    would not do so again.

34. What then of the significance of the Appellant's new baby?   Mr  Melvin
    asked me to find that the father is  likely  the  Appellant's  husband,
    whom the Home Office last encountered trying to enter this  country  in
    2014. Mr Melvin postulated that he could  be  living  in  this  country
    illegally, waiting for his wife and children to be granted some form of
    leave then using that to regularise his position. That is  certainly  a
    possibility, and I note that no DNA  evidence  has  been  submitted  to
    establish  that  the  children  have  different  fathers.  As  to   the
    Appellant's account of her night out in a Stoke club this seems  highly
    implausible, particularly when set in the context of the overall claim.
     Would the Appellant, on NASS support with two children, spend money on
    going to a nightclub?  Would  the  Appellant,  who  narrates  a  recent
    personal history of sexual abuse, have sex with a stranger in a toilet?
      Both  of  these  questions  have  particular  resonance   given   the
    Appellant's upbringing in conservative Northern Albania, and I  further
    note the absence of any supporting evidence from  the  women  whom  the
    Appellant claims to have gone out with. She has  called  evidence  from
    women that she lived with four years ago, but none from the women  with
    whom she most recently lived, and who  could  easily  corroborate  this
    significant element of the claim.   I have given weight to the evidence
    of Witness 1 and Witness  2,  both  of  whom  gave  perfectly  credible
    evidence to the effect that as far as they are concerned the  Appellant
    is a single mum. I have considered their evidence  in  the  round,  but
    standing back and viewing the evidence as a whole I  am  not  satisfied
    that the Appellant has demonstrated that her third child was  conceived
    in the manner she has described. I do not have the evidence  before  me
    to make a positive finding one way or the other about the paternity  of
    that child, but I am not satisfied that the father is a stranger.

35. For the foregoing reasons I find  that  the  Appellant  has  failed  to
    discharge the burden of proof and show that she has a well-founded fear
    of persecution in Albania from T or any  other  traffickers.    If  she
    returns to Albania today she will have, at the very least, the  support
    of her sister, who is apparently living independently in Tirana.  As Ms
    Benitez acknowledged in  her  submissions,  any  discrete  claim  under
    paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) of the Rules would stand and fall on  the  same
    factual matrix, a factual matrix I have rejected.

36. Finally, I would note that the Appellant's third child, whose  date  of
    birth is known to the Home Office, should also now be  treated  as  her
    dependant.




    Decisions

37. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set  aside.  I  remake
    the decision in the appeal by dismissing it on asylum and human  rights
    grounds.

38. This is a protection appeal involving three minors. Having  had  regard
    to the guidance in  the  Presidential  Guidance  Note  No  1  of  2013:
    Anonymity Orders and Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)
    Rules 2008 I consider it appropriate to make an order in the  following
    terms:

        "Unless and until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify her  or  any  member  of  her
        family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
        Appellants  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with  this
        direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"


                                                                       [pic]
                                                  Upper Tribunal Judge Bruce
                                                              7th March 2020
