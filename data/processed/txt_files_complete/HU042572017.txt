                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by a national of Nepal, born  in  1993,  against  the
    decision of the Entry Clearance Officer refusing the appellant's  human
    rights claim which had been on the basis that she had neither  met  the
    requirements of Appendix FM as  relates  to  adult  dependants  or  the
    requirements from the Immigration Directorate Instruction  in  relation
    to Gurkhas.


 2. The judge noted that  there  was  no  dispute  the  appellant  was  the
    daughter of a former Gurkha soldier who had died on  23  October  2009,
    who with her mother now resides in the United Kingdom.  The appellant's
    father had been a soldier for six  years  before  being  discharged  on
    medical grounds in  1970.   The  appellant  is  the  youngest  of  five
    children, all of whom are married and live in Nepal.


 3. The  judge  heard  evidence  from  the  appellant's  mother.   Although
    satisfied the appellant's father was a Gurkha he could not be satisfied
    how long that had been  the  case  before  his  discharge.   The  judge
    reached the following conclusions and findings as follows:


         "12. I have  considered  whether  the  Appellant  can  satisfy  the
             requirements of Appendix FM and in particular  Section  EC-DR.
             I am satisfied that she cannot.  Firstly she cannot show  that
             she requires  long-term  personal  care  to  perform  everyday
             tasks.  I  have  seen  no  evidence  that  could  support  his
             proposition.  Secondly I cannot be  satisfied  that  Appellant
             can be adequately maintained and accommodated without recourse
             to public funds.  On the evidence before me, the  only  source
             of income that they can show that they would have is the  ï¿½636
             per  month  in  benefits.   This  would  have   to   pay   for
             accommodation as well as maintenance.  On the evidence  before
             me I cannot be satisfied that this is sufficient  to  maintain
             them  adequately.   Equally  given   the   sponsor's   present
             accommodation is not sufficient for the Appellant, I cannot be
             satisfied that there is adequate accommodation.  As  a  result
             of these factors the Appellant cannot satisfy the requirements
             of either Paragraph E-ECDR.2.4 or 3.1, As a result the  appeal
             fails under Appendix FM.


         13.  I have gone on to consider whether there are  any  exceptional
             factors that means that the appeal should be  allowed  outside
             the rules.  In this regard I have given careful  consideration
             to the guidance given under Annex K of the IDI and I have also
             taken account of the guidance published on 28th December  2017
             (even though it post-dates  the  decision).   Within  these  I
             cannot find any indication that where the Gurkha ex-serviceman
             has passed away, then the adult child of the Gurkha can  apply
             on the basis of link to the widowed partner.  In any  event  I
             am not, on the evidence,  satisfied  of  the  father's  4-year
             service or that the father would have made an application  for
             settlement before 2009, had the  option  been  available.   As
             such on the evidence before e the Appellant does  not  qualify
             under any policy for entry to the United  Kingdom.   In  these
             circumstances there are no exceptional circumstances that mean
             that the appeal should be allowed outside the  rules.   Indeed
             if the sponsor wished to  continue  a  family  life  with  the
             Appellant, this could be continued in Nepal,  where  she  only
             left just over a year  ago.   As  such  the  decision  of  the
             Respondent is proportionate  to  the  legitimate  aim  sought,
             namely the preservation of  the  economic  well-being  of  the
             United Kingdom.  As such this appeal is dismissed."


 4. Permission to appeal has been granted on the basis that it was arguable
    the Tribunal should have made findings on whether there was an  Article
    8 family life between the appellant and her sponsoring mother,  and  if
    so, whether the historic injustice against Gurkhas and  their  families
    was a factor in this case.


 5. The appellant's mother together with a friend,  a  British  citizen  Mr
    Ganesh Sunuwar (they  are  not  related  but  from  the  same  village)
    attended the hearing.  Unfortunately no interpreter  had  been  booked,
    however Mr Sunuwar had a good  command  of  English  and  was  able  to
    assist.


 6. When on review of the issues in the case, Ms Petterson's attention  was
    drawn to the judge having in effect made a finding of family life.  The
    judge had also appeared  to  have  rejected  the  case  without  proper
    consideration of Article 8 grounds by confining  his  consideration  to
    the absence of any specific provision in  the  Immigration  Directorate
    Instructions and  the  absence  of  exceptional  circumstances  without
    giving proper weight to the family life that had been established.   Ms
    Petterson candidly accepted that the judge had erred in relation to the
    proportionality exercise and she agreed the decision required to be set
    aside.  In respect of its remaking, Ms Petterson accepted this could be
    undertaken without further  evidence.   She  conceded  the  appellant's
    appeal.


NOTICE OF DECISION


 7. Accordingly, the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge is set aside
    as it is accepted by the Secretary of State.  We  remake  the  decision
    and as also conceded, this appeal is allowed.


 8. No anonymity direction is made.
