Representation:
Appellant   Mr Chrico, Counsel, instructed by Fadiga & Co
Respondent  Mr Parkinson (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen  of  Nigeria.  On  September  28,  2010  the
    appellant was granted limited leave to remain in the United Kingdom  as
    a Tier 1 Highly  Skilled  Post  Study  Worker.  On  July  9,  2012  the
    appellant applied for a variation of his leave to enter or  remain  but
    the respondent refused this on August 15, 2013 and  at  the  same  time
    took a decision to remove  him  pursuant  to  section  47  Immigration,
    Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

 2. The appellant appealed  this  decision  on  September  2,  2013,  under
    section 82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

 3. The appeal  came  before  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Raymond
    (hereinafter referred to as the "FtTJ") on  July  11,  2014  and  in  a
    decision promulgated on August 12, 2014 he refused the appeal under the
    Immigration Rules and Article 8 ECHR.

 4. The appellant lodged grounds of appeal on August  21,  2014  submitting
    the FtTJ had erred by materially in law by failing to carry out a  full
    Article 8 assessment.

 5. Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Astle refused permission to appeal  on
    September 24, 2014 and the appellant renewed his grounds of  appeal  to
    the Upper Tribunal. Upper Tribunal  Judge  Kebede  gave  permission  to
    appeal.

 6. The matter originally came before me on April  24,  2015  and  at  that
    hearing Mr Parkinson accepted that in  light  of  the  fact  there  was
    evidence the appellant's child was a British citizen  he  was,  from  a
    pragmatic point of view, in agreement with Mr Chirico, there  had  been
    an error in law.

 7. Mr Chrico indicated that he would want the matter remitted back to  the
    first-tier but in light of the respondent's approach I stated  that  at
    this moment in time I was minded to retain conduct of the appeal but  I
    would when inquiries were concluded review the position.

 8. Following the conclusion of those inquiries the matter came back before
    me on August 3, 2015 and on that occasion I had to adjourn the case for
    the emails, relied on by the respondent,  to  be  served  on  both  the
    Tribunal and the appellant's representatives.

 9. The matter returned before me today and I was kindly  provided  with  a
    skeleton argument by Mr Chirico who again repeated his  request  for  a
    remittal. He submitted this Tribunal would have to undertake additional
    fact finding both on the appellant's contribution to UK  life  and  the
    consequences of the appellant's daughter being issued with a passport.

10. Mr Parkinson agreed that the First-tier may well  now  be  the  correct
    venue especially as a fresh issue  had  been  raised  in  the  skeleton
    argument namely section 1(3)(a) of the British Nationality Act 1981.

11. Part 3, Section 7.1 to 7.3 of the Practice Statement states:

         "Where under section 12(1) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement
         Act 2007 (proceedings on appeal to the Upper  Tribunal)  the  Upper
         Tribunal finds that the making of the decision  concerned  involved
         the making of an error on a point of law, the  Upper  Tribunal  may
         set aside the decision and, if it does so, must  either  remit  the
         case to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  under  section  12(2)(b)(i)  or
         proceed (in accordance with relevant Practice  Directions)  to  re-
         make the decision under section 12(2)(b)(ii).

         The Upper Tribunal is likely on each such occasion to proceed to re-
         make the decision, instead of remitting the case to the  First-tier
         Tribunal, unless the Upper Tribunal is satisfied that:ï¿½

          a) the effect of the error has been to deprive a party before the
             First-tier Tribunal of a fair hearing or other opportunity for
             that party's case to be put to and considered  by  the  First-
             tier Tribunal; or

          b) the nature or extent of any judicial  fact  finding  which  is
             necessary in order for the decision in the appeal  to  be  re-
             made is such that, having regard to the  overriding  objective
             in rule 2, it is appropriate to remit the case to  the  First-
             tier Tribunal.

         Remaking rather than remitting  will  nevertheless  constitute  the
         normal approach to determining appeals where an  error  of  law  is
         found, even if some further fact finding is necessary."

12. In light of the Practice Direction and whilst I had  some  concerns  in
    remitting this matter back to  the  first  Tier  Tribunal  due  to  the
    inherent delays existing in the jurisdiction  at  the  present  time  I
    accepted the joint submissions and remitted  the  matter  back  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

13. With consent of the parties  I  record  that  the  respondent  has  not
    suggested the appellant's daughter's passport was obtained  unlawfully.
    Mr Parkinson accepts the passport was issued to her based on the letter
    provided to the appellant by the army.

14. It goes without saying that once that date has been fixed the appellant
    should serve on both the tribunal and the respondent and updated bundle
    of evidence that is to be relied on.

15. I am conscious of the fact this case began its life in 2013  and  would
    ask that the matter be given an earliest listing as possible.

    DECISION

16. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law. I have set aside the decision.

17. The appeal is remitted back to the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  a  fresh
    appeal  hearing  under  Section  12  of  the  Tribunals,   Courts   and
    Enforcement Act 2007.
