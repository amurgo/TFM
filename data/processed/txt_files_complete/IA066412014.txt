                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Tettey instructed by Jackson & Canter
For the Respondent:    Mr A McVeety, Senior Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The representatives have accepted that the determination of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge O Williams is marred  by  error  in  the  light  of  the
    incomplete section at [26].  Mr McVeety candidly acknowledged  that  it
    was not possible to be sure that the ensuing paragraphs  reflected  the
    factors  that  the  judge  had  considered  seriously  undermined   the
    credibility of the appellant, the impact of  which  has  a  fundamental
    bearing on the case.

 2. Accordingly, the appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for  its
    further consideration on all issues.  Those issues may well include the
    respondent's decision on an asylum claim that has now been made by  the
    appellant for which he has been interviewed.

Signed
                    Date 13 November 2014
