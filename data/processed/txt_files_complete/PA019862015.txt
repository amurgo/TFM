For the Appellant:     Ms N Loughran, of Loughran & Co, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr A Mullen, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals against a determination  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge S Gillespie, promulgated on 20 February 2017, on 2 grounds:

      (1) The judge failed to consider the test in HJ & HT [2010] UKSC 31 at
      �82: the tribunal must ask itself whether  the  appellant  is  gay  or
      would be treated as gay by potential persecutors.  The judge erred  at
      �41 by failing to consider whether the appellant would be treated as a
      Christian by the authorities in  Iran.   HJ  and  HT  was  applied  to
      religious belief in MN and others [2012] UKUT 00389.

      (2) The judge said at �47 that the appellant's son [T] was approaching
      his 17th birthday and well on the way to becoming an adult.  The judge
      "failed to consider the best interests of the child in isolation  from
      other factors" (Kaur [2017] UKUT 00014, headnote  3)  and  "failed  to
      consider the best interest of the child at the date of the hearing".

 2. FtT Judge Keane granted permission on 3 April 2017.

 3. The grant is partly on the basis that the judge did  not  arrive  at  a
    finding whether the appellant is a Christian convert.  That  is  not  a
    point raised in ground (1). It aims rather at the  possibility  of  the
    appellant being seen as a Christian, even if he is not.

 4. Ms Loughran said that although the decision is not  entirely  explicit,
    it is plainly to the  effect  that  the  appellant  is  not  a  genuine
    convert, and that the argument based on perception is not a  good  one.
    She correctly conceded  that  there  is  nothing  in  ground  (1),  and
    advanced only ground (2).

Submissions for appellant.

 5. Ground 2 showed a clear error of failure to consider the best interests
    of the child.

 6. At paragraph 46 the judge  found  family  life  to  exist  between  the
    appellant and his son [T]. The assessment which followed  at  paragraph
    47 was on proportionality only. There was no separate assessment of the
    best interests of the child, as plainly required by the case law: Kaur,
    above, and HS (2010) CSIH 97 at paragraph 19:

      Whether it is in the best interests of these two children to remain in
      the UK must depend upon their particular circumstances, which were not
      explored.

 7. This case was analogous.

 8. No account was taken of the written statement and  oral  evidence  from
    [T]. The statement (FtT inventory 3,  item  2)  was  clear  as  to  the
    serious effect on the child of the past separation from his father, the
    benefit gained from his presence in the UK, e.g. in his school  outlook
    and improved grades, and the devastation he would experience if he were
    to be further separated from his father by his removal  to  Iran.  That
    was simply not weighed in the scales.

 9. The judge said that child had indefinite leave to  remain,  when  there
    was plain evidence before him  that  the  child  has  been  granted  UK
    citizenship. The authorities are clear on the great significance to  be
    attached to such citizenship: ZH (Tanzania) (2011) UKSC 4.

10. The judge got the facts wrong, overlooked significant evidence, and did
    not take account of the best interests of the child.

Submissions for respondent.

11. As the judge observed, the child was approaching his 17th birthday  the
    time of the hearing. Family ties do not end when  a  child  becomes  an
    adult, but considerations of the best interests of  the  child  through
    maintaining a link with a parent do fade as maturity approaches.

12. The judge did not make a specific finding on where the  best  interests
    of the child lay, but he reached a proportionality  outcome  which  was
    well justified.

13. The judge did not fail to make a  finding  on  the  evidence  from  the
    appellant's son. He looked at the history of family migration  and  the
    massive shift by the appellant's relatives from blaming him  for  their
    misfortunes and migration, to supporting him  after  they  had  secured
    their own position. Paragraph 38 explained why the  evidence  from  the
    appellant's son was given little weight. The judge was entitled to find
    the  evidence  vastly  overstated.  There   been   no   evidence   that
    realistically it would have any adverse impact  on  the  child  if  his
    father were  to  leave  the  UK.  In  absence  of  any  likely  serious
    detriment, the decision should stand.

14. It might have been  a  counsel  of  perfection  to  narrate  a  finding
    explicitly in terms of the best interests of the  child,  but  in  this
    case the omission was not an error of law.

Response for appellant.

15. There had not been an absence of evidence of the detrimental effects on
    the child likely to arise from the appellant's  removal.  It  was  very
    plainly set out in his witness statement.

16. There had been extensive evidence for the appellant set out in multiple
    inventories.  That included documents 4 and 6 of inventory  3,  medical
    reports showing that the appellant's son suffered from serious issues -
    depression; drinking alcohol; not getting up out of bed, not  attending
    school; school report of inability to focus and  lethargy;  nightmares;
    very low mood; some deliberate self-harm, some suicidal ideation.

17. The absence of a finding on the best  interests  of  the  child  was  a
    material error of law requiring  the  decision  to  be  set  aside  and
    remade.

Discussion and conclusions.

18. The judge erred in fact by saying that  [T]  has  indefinite  leave  to
    remain, when at the time of the hearing he had become a UK citizen.  Ms
    Loughran said this was highly significant, given the recognition in the
    case law of the high value to be attached to citizenship when  deciding
    cases about the best interest of children.

19. This case is not about a UK citizen child potentially having  to  leave
    the UK. The child lives in Newcastle with his mother and  the  rest  of
    the family. The appellant presently lives  in  Glasgow.   There  is  no
    question of the child returning to Iran  with  the  appellant,  if  the
    appellant returns, or of his losing any of the benefits of citizenship.
    The distinction between indefinite  leave  to  remain  and  citizenship
    makes no difference to the outcome for the child.  The slip  is  of  no
    significance.

20. At paragraphs 36 and 37 the judge records that  an  older  son  of  the
    appellant had portrayed in medical evidence the nightmarish effects  of
    his father's behaviour,  but  14  months  later  in  other  proceedings
    provided a statement that he missed his father dearly  and  would  like
    very much to see him. The judge continued at paragraph 38:

      In the present appeal, all [the appellant's] children and  his  former
      wife have  made  statements  saying  how  much  they  would  wish  the
      appellant to be given refuge in the UK. I am completely  sceptical  of
      their claims given it is alleged he was responsible for them having to
      leave Iran in fear in the first place.

21. The grounds do not challenge that finding. On the evidence and  in  its
    reasoning, it is soundly justified. It encompasses  the  evidence  from
    [T] and disposes of the challenge so far as based on  overlooking  that
    evidence and failing to make a finding upon it.

22. Ms Loughran has advanced the  case  for  the  appellant  again  at  its
    highest, but the  judge's  findings  of  fact  leave  no  scope  for  a
    conclusion that the appellant's departure from the UK  would  have  any
    significant adverse effect upon [T], or  that  his  continued  presence
    would be significantly to [T]'s benefit.  The evidence designed to show
    that was both vague and exaggerated, and was comprehensively  rejected.



23. The judge should ideally have said something explicitly to  the  effect
    that the child's best interests were not materially affected by whether
    the appellant was granted leave to remain in the UK.   However,  it  is
    plain from the findings he did make that there was nothing to show that
    the best interests of [T] favoured a grant of leave to  the  appellant,
    and the outcome would have been the same.  The error  is  of  form  not
    substance, and not such as to require the decision to be set aside.

24. The decision of the FtT shall stand.

25. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
