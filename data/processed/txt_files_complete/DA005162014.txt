For the appellant:     Mr C Avery, a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Secretary of State:     Mr R Abdar, instructed by Kesar & Co,
solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. The Secretary of State appeals with permission against  the  decision
       of the First-tier Tribunal (First-tier Tribunal Judge Pedro) allowing
       the claimant's appeal against her decision on 14 March 2014 to make a
       deportation order by virtue of section 5(1) of  the  Immigration  Act
       1971.  The claimant is a citizen of the Netherlands, and is therefore
       also an EEA citizen.  He entered the United  Kingdom  in  1996  as  a
       minor, to join  his  mother  here.   He  was  granted  first  an  EEA
       residence permit, and on 23 July 2005, indefinite leave to remain  as
       his mother's dependent, in accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the
       Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006  (as  amended).
       He has  permanent  resident  status  under  regulation  15  of  those
       regulations.





  Regulation 21:  'serious grounds' and 'imperative grounds' for removal





    2. Pursuant to regulation 21 of the EEA regulations, EEA citizens may be
       removed from the United Kingdom only on  grounds  of  public  policy,
       public security or public health, and not to serve economic ends.




    3. Where  a  permanent  right  of  residence  has  been  acquired  under
       regulation 15, then the power to remove is further constrained by sub-
       paragraphs 21(3), 21(4), 21(5) and 21(6) thereof of the  Regulations.
       Sub-paragraphs 21(3) and 21(4) concern, respectively, the position of
       those with permanent residence, and those who  have  resided  in  the
       United Kingdom for 'a continuous period of at least 10 years prior to
       the relevant decision' or are minors:

           "Decisions taken on public policy, public  security  and  public
           health grounds
           21. ...(3)  A relevant decision may not be taken in respect of a
                person with a permanent right of residence under  regulation
                15 except on serious grounds  of  public  policy  or  public
                security.
                (4)    A relevant  decision  may  not  be  taken  except  on
                imperative grounds of public security in respect of  an  EEA
                national who-
                    (a)     has  resided  in  the  United  Kingdom   for   a
                        continuous period of at least ten  years  prior  to
                        the relevant decision; or
                    (b)    is under the  age  of  18,  unless  the  relevant
                        decision is necessary in  his  best  interests,  as
                        provided for in the Convention on the Rights of the
                        Child adopted by the General Assembly of the United
                        Nations on 20th November 1989.

    4. Sub-paragraphs 21(5) and 21(6) set out  the  matters  which  must  be
       taken into account when considering the  proportionality  of  removal
       and the personal conduct and circumstances of the EEA citizen:

           "21    (5)  Where a relevant decision is  taken  on  grounds  of
                public policy or public security it shall,  in  addition  to
                complying with the preceding paragraphs of this  regulation,
                be taken in accordance with the following principles-
                    (a)    the decision must comply with  the  principle  of
                        proportionality;
                    (b)    the decision must be  based  exclusively  on  the
                        personal conduct of the person concerned;
                    (c)    the personal conduct of the person concerned must
                        represent  a  genuine,  present  and   sufficiently
                        serious threat affecting  one  of  the  fundamental
                        interests of society;
                    (d)    matters isolated from the particulars of the case
                        or  which  relate  to  considerations  of   general
                        prevention do not justify the decision;
                    (e)    a person's previous criminal convictions  do  not
                        in themselves justify the decision.

                (6)    Before taking a relevant decision on the  grounds  of
                public policy or public security in relation to a person who
                is resident in the United Kingdom the  decision  maker  must
                take account of considerations such as  the  age,  state  of
                health, family and economic situation  of  the  person,  the
                person's length of residence  in  the  United  Kingdom,  the
                person's social and cultural  integration  into  the  United
                Kingdom and the  extent  of  the  person's  links  with  his
                country of origin. ..."



    5. The First-tier Tribunal did not hear detailed argument on the correct
       standard to be applied in this appeal since (see paragraph 8  of  the
       determination) the Secretary of State at  the  hearing,  and  in  her
       letter of decision of 17 March 2014, accepted that the  claimant  met
       the integration criteria and that 'As a result  it  is  necessary  to
       establish that your deportation is warranted on imperative grounds of
       public security'.






    6. The writer of the deportation decision in March 2014 did not have the
       benefit of the guidance given in the decision of the  Upper  Tribunal
       in MG in August 2014 as to how to apply the decision of the  European
       Court of Justice in Secretary of State for the Home Department  v  MG
       (Judgment of the Court) [2014] EUECJ C-400/12.






    7. I am not aware that any further deportation decision has  been  taken
       since August 2014.


  Background


    8. The claimant is a Netherlands citizen of  Ghanaian  origin,  who  has
       been in the United Kingdom, albeit with one significant interruption,
       since 1996.   He was born on 16 April 1988; when he  arrived  in  the
       United Kingdom to join his mother, he was 8 years old.


    9. The claimant has an unedifying record of United Kingdom  criminality.
       He pleaded guilty to all but one of the  recorded  offences.   He  is
       first recorded as having come to adverse attention on 20 April  2004,
       when he received a warning for assault occasioning actual bodily harm
       contrary to section 47 of the Offences Against the Person  Act  1861.
       He was  then  just  17  years  old.   On  13  January  2006,  he  was
       reprimanded for the possession of  cannabis,  a  class  C  controlled
       drug, contrary to section 5 of the Misuse of Drugs  Act  1971.   That
       was his first recorded adult offence.




   10. In 2004/5, he went to Ghana to see his father and spent approximately
       9 months there.




   11. On 12 April 2006, the claimant committed two offences of robbery, for
       which he was sentenced at Harrow Crown Court on 14 September 2006  to
       a community order, supervised by the probation  service.  On  19  May
       2006, the claimant was found in possession  of  cannabis  and  on  17
       November 2006, he received a conditional discharge for that  offence.
       On 15 July 2006, the claimant committed a further  cannabis  offence,
       for which on 17  July  2006  at  Thames  Magistrates  Court,  he  was
       sentenced to �80 or one day in prison.  He did not pay the fine.   On
       18 November 2006, the claimant was found in possession of a  class  A
       drug, cocaine, as well as cannabis.  On 23 February 2007,  at  Thames
       Magistrates Court he was sentenced to a further community order under
       probation supervision. On 30 December 2008, the claimant was arrested
       for travelling on the railway without paying.  He  was  convicted  of
       that offence at Stratford Magistrates Court on 11 May 2009.  There is
       no record of his plea.  He was fined �150 plus costs of  �30  and  �4
       compensation.




   12. There was then a hiatus in the claimant's criminal record until on  9
       March 2010, he was arrested found in possession of larger supplies of
       unspecified Class A drugs, more than required for his  personal  use.
       He was bailed to appear at Winchester Crown Court, but while on bail,
       on 22 March 2010, he  committed  an  attempted  robbery  contrary  to
       section 8 of the Theft Act 1968.  On 14 July 2010 he was sentenced to
       a total of 4 years' imprisonment, 2 years to be  served  concurrently
       on four drugs offences of possession with intent to supply,  and  two
       years to be served consecutively for the robbery.  The  claimant  was
       now 22 years old.




   13. On 15 March 2012, the claimant was served with a deportation  notice,
       against which he appealed.  He was granted bail on 5 April  2012  and
       on 2 October 2012, his appeal was allowed, on the basis that  he  had
       shown remorse, and his girlfriend  was  pregnant.  The  claimant  was
       still on licence in relation to the 4  year  sentence.   On  22  June
       2012, the  claimant  was  arrested  in  possession  of  cannabis  and
       cannabis resin and was fined �75 at East  London  Magistrates  Court,
       with costs of �85 and a �15 victim surcharge. On 16 November 2012, he
       was sent a warning letter by the Home Office to his release  address.






   14. On 9 January 2013, the claimant's partner gave birth to his first and
       only child, a daughter.  On 26 January 2013, while still on  licence,
       the  claimant  in  one  incident  committed  a  further  offence   of
       possession of  cannabis  with  intent  to  supply  and  four  driving
       offences.  He appeared  before  Cambridge  Magistrates  Court  on  28
       January and his driving licence was endorsed  for  driving  otherwise
       than in accordance  with  a  licence.   He  was  later  sentenced  by
       Cambridge Crown Court to 21 months'  imprisonment  on  the  remaining
       charges of failing to provide a specimen  for  analysis,  failing  to
       comply with a no entry sign, driving while uninsured, and  possession
       of cannabis with  intent  to  supply.    His  relationship  with  his
       girlfriend appears to have broken down at around this time.




   15. On 20 March 2014, a further deportation decision was taken.  That  is
       the decision which is the subject of the present appeal. On  23  June
       2014, the claimant was released again on  licence,  to  live  at  his
       mother's address.  His former partner and child  live  elsewhere  but
       visit regularly and the claimant is said to be 'amazingly  close'  to
       his baby daughter, who he sees daily and  takes  on  outings  to  the
       park.  His ex-partner has another daughter, who is very fond  of  the
       claimant. He has two sisters: one  has  Down's  syndrome,  while  the
       other assists in her sister's care and supports their mother as well.
       The claimant's licence for the latest offence expired on  2  December
       2014.  For that six-month period,  the  claimant  complied  with  the
       terms of his licence.  No further offences have been relied  upon  in
       the first two months of 2015.

  The First-tier Tribunal decision


   16. In his decision, the First-tier Tribunal Judge  confirmed  (paragraph
       4) that he had carefully considered all of the evidence  before  him.
       He took into account the previous determination in  relation  to  the
       earlier deportation decision, taking  that  as  his  starting  point,
       applying  Devaseelan  (STARRED  Secretary  of  State  for  the   Home
       Department v D (Tamil) [2002] UKIAT 00702).   He adopted the findings
       of the first Tribunal as to the length of time that the claimant  had
       been in the United Kingdom before the relevant decision  and  applied
       the higher 'imperative grounds of public policy' test to the proposed
       deportation, relying on the concession by the Secretary of State  and
       the 2012 finding that the 10-year period had been established.    The
       judge applied regulation 21(5) and 21(6).




   17. The First-tier Tribunal judge then considered the recent evidence  of
       rehabilitation and the claimant's private  and  family  life  in  the
       United Kingdom. He  took  into  account  a  NOMS  (National  Offender
       Management  Service)  report  prepared  in  June  2013  which  showed
       positive indications:  the claimant had not  recently  committed  any
       violent offences and had taken various courses under  the  Moving  On
       Project.  There were said to be 'strong indications of his  inability
       to refrain from committing further offences' but he had  expressed  a
       desire to abstain completely from  drugs  and  that  'his  choice  of
       lifestyle  needs  an  overhaul  given  the  added  responsibility  of
       fatherhood', referring to the birth of his  child,  just  before  the
       final offence which had led to the second deportation decision.




   18.  In  considering  proportionality,  the  judge  gave  weight  to  the
       claimant's links to his daughter, his partner and  her  other  child,
       his mother and his disabled sister as part of his overall family life
       in the United Kingdom.  The judge stated that he  believed  that  the
       birth of the child might have become a catalyst  for  good  and  that
       removal of the claimant would not now be proportionate.  The core  of
       the judge's reasoning is at paragraphs 16-17 of the decision:




           "16.   The  claimant's  full  integration  into  United  Kingdom
           society was already considered and decided upon by the  Tribunal
           in the determination promulgated on 2  October  2012.   By  that
           time, the Tribunal was satisfied that full integration had  been
           established.  That integration and the claimant's  prospects  of
           full rehabilitation can only have been extended and enhanced  by
           the birth of his child and the conduct he has  shown  since  his
           release in taking on board his full responsibility as  a  father
           and the love and devotion he has shown to that child.  He has no
           known links with the Netherlands and he  clearly  has  firm  and
           established links and family life  in  the  United  Kingdom.   I
           would add that he must surely be aware that any decision I  make
           on his appeal may give  him  one  last  final  chance  to  prove
           himself and that any deterioration in his behaviour and  conduct
           may well result in him  facing  removal  on  a  future  occasion
           involving separation from his child and family members.  I would
           hope that he would very seriously take this on board.




           17.      Having   carefully   considered   the   principle    of
           proportionality and all other factors to be considered  pursuant
           to regulation 21(5) and (6), I find that I am not satisfied that
           the Secretary of State's decision to remove the  claimant  meets
           the high threshold  required  to  be  considered  imperative  on
           grounds  of  public  security.   Therefore,  I  find  that   the
           Secretary of State's decision does breach the claimant's  rights
           as an EEA national under the community treaties  in  respect  of
           residence interest eh United Kingdom and I allow his appeal. "

  Secretary of State's grounds of appeal

   19. The Secretary of State appealed.  Despite her failure  to  raise  the
       point at the hearing or in her deportation decision, or  formally  to
       withdraw the concession made at the hearing, she now  contended  that
       the First-tier Tribunal had erred in treating as settled the question
       whether the claimant was entitled to the higher 'imperative  grounds'
       test for removal of EEA citizens with 10 years'  residence  preceding
       the decision to deport.  She contended that the proper  approach  was
       to  apply  the  'serious  grounds'  test  in  rule  21(3),  not   the
       'imperative grounds' test in rule 21(4), and that  the  Secretary  of
       State had demonstrated sufficient ongoing risk from this  appellant's
       criminality to meet the 'serious grounds' test.




   20. The Secretary of State accepted that the claimant was integrated into
       United Kingdom society but argued that the degree of his  integration
       was not as great as contended, having regard to the serious nature of
       his offending behaviour, over a very long period.  The  small  family
       network in which the claimant moved was not sufficient  to  establish
       integration in the wider society, particularly as  the  relationships
       in question had been  in  existence  throughout  the  period  of  his
       offending behaviour.  He had been aware that he was about to become a
       father when the final offence was committed, and  his  baby  daughter
       should not be a 'trump card' on that basis.




   21. The Secretary of State contended that  the  claimant's  assertion  of
       remorse and of having addressed his offending behaviour was the  same
       assertion which had been successfully made to the  2012  Tribunal  in
       respect of the first deportation order: his  subsequent  conduct  did
       not support those assertions and the second Tribunal,  on  Devaseelan
       principles, should have treated the later offences as new  facts  and
       reassessed his rehabilitation and remorse on that basis.  The  First-
       tier  Tribunal  had  failed  to  engage  with   the   core   of   the
       proportionality assessment: in the light of  the  claimant's  serious
       offending  and  his  continued  failure  to  address  his   offending
       triggers, combined with the lack  of  genuine  integration,  and  the
       independent assessment that he remained a risk, as recently  as  June
       2013, the proposed deportation was proportionate.




   22. First-tier Tribunal Judge Brunnen considered the proposed grounds  of
       appeal to be arguable and granted permission.




   23. The claimant did not serve a Rule 24 Reply.




   24. That was the basis on which this appeal  came  before  me.   I  heard
       submissions and reserved my decision, which I now give.


  Error of law hearing

   25. For the Secretary of State, Mr Avery argued that the decision of  the
       European  Court  on  the  Upper  Tribunal  reference  in  MG's   case
       (Secretary of State for the Home Department v  MG  (Judgment  of  the
       Court) [2014] EUECJ C-400/12) established that in principle, a prison
       term was capable of disrupting the 10-year period  required  for  the
       'imperative grounds' protection level, although the  effect  of  such
       sentences could be mitigated, depending on the circumstances.  In the
       present case, the First-tier Tribunal judge had erroneously taken the
       opposite approach, treating the 10 year period as established by  the
       2012 determination.  It  was  difficult  to  see  how  a  sustainable
       decision could be made if that were an erroneous basis in approaching
       regulation 21(4).  Mr Avery made no reference to the concession  made
       at the hearing by the presenting officer  that  'imperative  grounds'
       was indeed the correct test, nor to  an  express  statement  to  that
       effect in the second deportation decision.





   26. Mr Avery relied on the guidance given by the  Upper  Tribunal  in  MG
       (prison-Article 28(3) (a) of  Citizens  Directive)  [2014]  UKUT  392
       (IAC), applying the guidance given by the European Court, which  also
       considered the decision of the Court of Appeal in Secretary of  State
       for the Home Department v FV (Italy) [2012] EWCA Civ  1199.   In  the
       Upper Tribunal decision in MG, they indicated that the European Court
       decision was difficult and that they  would  have  been  prepared  to
       grant permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal had it been sought.






   27. Mr Avery asked me to find a material error of law  and  substitute  a
       decision dismissing the claimant's appeal.






   28. For the claimant, Mr Abdar argued that he was entitled to the  higher
       'imperative grounds' level of protection.  He had come to the  United
       Kingdom in 1996 and had acquired that protection by 2006.   Once  the
       protection was achieved, it could not be  lost.   Mr  Abdar  accepted
       that it would be possible for the claimant to be  deported  lawfully,
       in appropriate circumstances, even if he had  that  higher  level  of
       protection, but submitted that the facts of the present case did  not
       reach the 'imperative grounds' standard, having proper regard to  the
       integration and proportionality tests  in  sub-paragraphs  21(5)  and
       21(6). Mr Abdar contended that the 10-year protection, once acquired,
       could not be lost, and if the Tribunal agreed, then there was plainly
       no material error of law in the First-tier Tribunal determination.






   29. In the event that the Tribunal found that only the 'serious  grounds'
       protection level  was available on the facts of this appeal, Mr Abdar
       submitted that the First-tier Tribunal had  taken  into  account  the
       claimant's integration and all relevant  factors.  The  claimant  had
       been in the United Kingdom for almost 20 years and the  Secretary  of
       State's grounds gave that insufficient weight. The claimant's absence
       in 2004/5 was not such as to break the continuity of  his  residence:
       EU law permitted absences of up to two years  and  the  claimant  had
       been absent for less  than  a  year.  He  asked  me  to  dismiss  the
       Secretary of  State's  appeal  and  uphold  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       determination.

  Discussion

   30. The first question is the standard of protection applicable  to  this
       appellant.   Given  the  claimant's   history   before   the   second
       deportation decision on 20  March  2014,  the  Secretary  of  State's
       statement in her deportation decision,  and  her  concession  at  the
       hearing that the 'imperative grounds' test was the correct one  seems
       generous, since for the 10 years immediately preceding the  decision,
       that is to say, between 20 March 2004 and 20 March 2014, the claimant
       had been absent in Ghana for 8/9 months  in  2005/6,  in  prison  for
       almost 2 years of a 4-year sentence between June 2010 and April 2012,
       and in prison again from January 2013 - 23 June 2014,  a  further  18
       months.  However, in my judgment, the First-tier Tribunal did not err
       in law, given that the Secretary of State did not put the question of
       the 'imperative grounds' test in issue, in proceeding  on  the  basis
       that such was the correct test.




   31. The First-tier Tribunal's decision took  into  account  all  relevant
       material and the evidence of the claimant,  his  ex-partner  and  his
       mother as to proportionality.  The decision reached was open  to  the
       First-tier  Tribunal  on  that  evidence,  if  integration  and   the
       'imperative grounds' test were not in  issue.   Accordingly,  I  find
       that there is no material error of law in  the  determination  and  I
       uphold it.


       Conclusion

       The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve
       the making of an error on a point of law.

       I do not set aside the decision.
