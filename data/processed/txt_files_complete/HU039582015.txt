               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Marfat of Newcastle Legal Centre
For the Respondent:    Mr D Mills, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


      1. The appellant was born on 15th August 1974 and is a Libyan citizen.




      2. On 3rd July, 2015 the respondent refused  to  grant  the  appellant
         leave to remain in the United Kingdom and the appellant appealed to
         the First-tier  Tribunal.   His  appeal  was  heard  by  First-tier
         Tribunal Judge  Howard  on  2nd  September  2016.   The  appellant,
         dissatisfied with the judge's  decision  to  refuse  to  allow  his
         appeal, sought and obtained permission to challenge it.

      3. The matter was called for hearing before me today when,  on  behalf
         of the Secretary of State, Mr Mills invited me to allow the  appeal
         outright,  given  the  errors  in  the  determination,  which  were
         accepted.  This determination appears as a matter of record only.

      4. The appellant's appeal is allowed under the immigration rules.




Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

The First-tier Tribunal made an anonymity direction under  Rule  13  of  the
Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Immigration  and  Asylum  Chamber)
Rules 2014.  I have decided not to continue the anonymity  direction,  there
being no basis for doing so.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

I have allowed the appeal and to the extent that any fee has  been  paid,  I
order that it should be repaid to the appellant.

Upper Tribunal Judge Chalkley
