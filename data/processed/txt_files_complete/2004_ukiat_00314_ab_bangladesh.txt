                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    The appellant appeals to the  Tribunal  with  permission  against  the
      determination of an Adjudicator, Warren L Grant, in which he dismissed
      his appeal against the  respondent's  decision  of  28  October  2000,
      refusing entry clearance.

2.    The appeal first came before the Tribunal on 25 September 2003.   Miss
      E Shaw, of Turpin Miller & Higgins, Solicitors, appeared on behalf  of
      the appellant and, appeared at all the subsequent hearings  also.   On
      25 September 2003, Mr M Blundell  appeared  on  behalf  of  the  Entry
      Clearance Officer.  Mr Blundell, raised concerns about  the  issue  of
      whether  the  appellant  could  properly  be  said  to  be   intending
      settlement in the United Kingdom when it seemed he proposed  to  spend
      half his time with his first wife in Bangladesh.  This clearly  raised
      issues as to the proper interpretation of paragraph 281  HC  395,  and
      accordingly the matter was adjourned to give the  representatives  the
      opportunity to argue the point.

3.    The Tribunal reconvened, on 18 December 2003.  On this occasion,  Miss
      Holmes appeared on behalf of the Entry Clearance Officer.

4.    Miss Shaw referred us to  grounds  tow  to  four  of  the  grounds  of
      appeal.  She also referred us to relevant paragraphs in  her  skeleton
      argument.  She referred us to Shah v Barnet  London  Borough  Council.
      This was not an immigration case.  The  absences  in  this  case  were
      temporary as the appellant intended to return.  He did not have to  be
      ordinarily resident in just one place.

5.    As regards the intention  to  live  together,  the  Immigration  Rules
      contemplated, validly polygamous marriages, which were not prohibited,
      as long as the non-British wife did not come into the United  Kingdom.
      The issue was not the sponsor's second marriage, but the fact  of  her
      marriage to her husband, whose marriage to her  was  polygamous.   The
      effect of the immigration rules was that the appellant could not  call
      the first wife over to the United  Kingdom.   It  was  a  question  of
      interpretation of the rules on marriage, and the purpose of the  rules
      was not to be read  as  demanding  that  they  spent  all  their  time
      together.  The word "continuously" was not used.

6.    As regards the human rights issues again she referred to the  skeleton
      argument.  In law, the sponsor could go and live  in  Bangladesh,  but
      she was a British citizen, with a number of  children,  some  of  whom
      were very young.  The sponsor had been widowed and the  appellant  was
      therefore complying with the requirements of his religion.  Article 14
      was also engaged.  His marriage had been arranged within  the  family,
      and he was very unlikely to leave and there would be a stigma  if  the
      marriage broke down.  They had spent little time together  before  the
      marriage and only four weeks afterwards, which explained his ignorance
      about  various  matters.   There  had  been  brief  telephone   calls.
      Assumptions should not be made about the  kind  of  conversation  they
      would have had.  With regard to the son's name Sylheti  was  a  spoken
      language only,  and  when  it  was  written  in  English,  it  was  an
      approximation of what was spoken and Shazan and Shahjahan sounded very
      much the same.  At interview, the appellant would have  been  speaking
      in Sylheti.  She accepted that on the face of it,  the  appellant  did
      not have enough knowledge of his son, but this was an explanation.

7.    As regards the support, she had income  support  and  housing  benefit
      with modest outgoings.  Documentation had been provided.  She  already
      received benefit which she would still receive, and the  question  was
      one of additional recourse to public funds.   The  children  had  free
      school meals and uniforms.  A schedule of weekly expenditure had  been
      provided.  She lived frugally but did her best.  Twenty five pounds  a
      month was put aside and was put into a  savings  account.   She  would
      cope on a tight budget, and the fact of the matter was that there  was
      money left over.  There were savings of over ï¿½1,000.00.   It  was  not
      entirely clear how those funds had come  about.   There  were  several
      savings accounts, and money shifted between them.  There was a surplus
      of income with which she could maintain the appellant.  He would  have
      permission to work.  His job offer had lapsed, given  the  passing  of
      time.  An unskilled worker scheme had recently  been  set  up  and  he
      could benefit from that and there would be a decrease in the sponsor's
      reliance on public funds.   As  regards  accommodation,  there  was  a
      report in the bundle, which had not been before  the  Adjudicator  and
      showed that it was adequate.

8.    This hearing was then adjourned to enable consideration  to  be  given
      to the issue of polygamy and whether as a matter of law, the appellant
      could join his wife in the United Kingdom in any event.   The  hearing
      was resumed on 7 May 2004.  Miss Holmes again  represented  the  Entry
      Clearance Officer.

9.    Miss Shaw referred us to the definition of  "ordinary  residence"  and
      the 1971 Immigration Act.  She had made her submissions on that.  This
      was not the same as domicile.  She referred us also to the  case  law,
      in the bundle including Kane, Haria and Ng.  As regards  the  validity
      of marriage point, if both were domiciled in Bangladesh, the  marriage
      was valid, though it was a question of whether both were domiciled  in
      Bangladesh.

10.   Miss Holmes made the point that there was no proof  of  any  intention
      to return.

11.   Miss Shaw argued that the sponsor had not  changed  her  domicile  and
      had kept Bangladeshi  citizenship,  as  she  could  have  acquired  UK
      citizenship.  This was relevant to the issue of domicile.  If it was a
      significant issue, it was though that she had changed her domicile  of
      choice and it could be necessary to hear evidence.

12.   Were considered that it would be of assistance to hear  oral  evidence
      from the sponsor on this point, and the appeal was adjourned.

13.   Subsequently, a letter was received from  Miss  Holmes  dated  2  July
      2004, indicating that the Secretary of State would not be arguing that
      the marriage of the appellant and the  sponsor  was  invalid  nor  was
      there any intention of cross-examining the sponsor.  The  appeal  came
      before the Tribunal again on 12 July 2004, Mr Deller  represented  the
      Entry Clearance Officer, as Miss Holmes was unavoidably absent due  to
      a family illness.  It was agreed that Miss Holmes  would  be  given  a
      week in which to put in her final submission with Miss Shaw to have  a
      further week thereafter to put in her own response.   We  subsequently
      received the submission from both representatives and, of course  have
      taken them fully into account in producing our determination.

14.   The marriage between the appellant  and  the  sponsor  is  the  second
      marriage for each of them.  The sponsor was a widow at the time of her
      marriage to the appellant, and he was still married  and  living  with
      his first wife, together with their three sons  and  three  daughters.
      His application to  join  the  sponsor  in  the  United  Kingdom,  was
      dismissed on the basis  that  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  was  not
      satisfied that the couple intended to  live  together  permanently  as
      husband  and  wife,  nor  that  the  appellant  would  be   adequately
      maintained and accommodated without recourse of public funds.

15.   The Adjudicator heard evidence from the sponsor.   He  noted  that  at
      interview the appellant was initially not able to remember the date of
      his marriage to the sponsor, and nor did he know the name of her first
      husband or the date of his death.  He did not know  when  the  sponsor
      had first gone to the United Kingdom, nor did he know how many of  her
      children went with her.  He did not know the date of birth of his  son
      by the sponsor and could not remember his name,  and  when  given  the
      correct name of the child, he thought that was her son  by  her  first
      husband (who died two years before this son was born).  He  said  that
      he telephoned her  from  his  shop  but  he  could  not  remember  her
      telephone number, and he did not know the ages of  her  children.   He
      thought that the sponsor was supported by her  son  and  daughter  who
      were both working.  He claimed to have a job lined up  but  could  not
      remember what it was nor the name of the restaurant which had  offered
      it to him.

16.   When the sponsor gave evidence, she said that she lived  with  several
      of  her  children  and  supported  herself  and  her  family  with   a
      combination of income support and child benefit.  She was asked  about
      deposits paid into her bank account and said that it was money paid to
      her by her two children who were working who would deposit money  into
      her account and take it back later.  She adopted a schedule of  weekly
      expenses that was to be found in her bundle and said that at  the  end
      of each month she had twenty five pounds left over which she put  into
      her savings account.  She lived  in  a  four  bedroomed  house.   Four
      children slept in the big bedroom, tow in another room  and  two  plus
      the baby in another room and she shared her bedroom with her  youngest
      child.  The marriage had been arranged  by  her  mother  and  mother's
      brother so that she would have someone to  look  after  the  children.
      She said that her son by the appellant was called [          ],  which
      was the name given by the appellant to the Entry Clearance Officer but
      she could not spell it in English, she said.  All of her children were
      of school age apart from her two year old son, and  two  children  who
      lived out of the house.

17.   Evidence was also given by [         ]  the  appellant's  nephew,  who
      said he did not believe the appellant would leave the sponsor once  he
      had been allowed to come to join us because it was  not  the  sort  of
      thing done in their family.  He said that he knew the person  who  had
      offered the appellant a job but  the  job  was  no  longer  on  offer,
      because the restaurant was not successful.   He said that the landlord
      would accept the appellant as a joint tenant of the  house,  and  that
      the house was not overcrowded because  the  children  were  all  quite
      young.

18.   The Adjudicator found that the sponsor  genuinely  believed  that  the
      appellant had been introduced to her as a marriage partner in order to
      help her to look after her large family.   He accepted that it was  an
      arranged marriage and that it  would  be  quite  wrong  to  judge  the
      parties by European standards.  He noted the fact that it  was  not  a
      marriage between complete strangers as the parties are related to each
      other  outside  marriage.   Tough  he  would  not  have  expected  the
      appellant to know  the  dates  of  birth  of  each  of  the  sponsor's
      children, he found it impossible to believe that he did not  know  the
      true name of his own son by the sponsor, and he  found  the  sponsor's
      evidence in this regard to be disingenuous.  He noted  that  even  the
      sponsor could not explain why the appellant thought that the  name  on
      the birth certificate was that of one of her own sons from  her  first
      marriage.  He also noted the fact that the appellant did not know  the
      child's date of birth, and found that his indicated a lack of interest
      by the appellant in the sponsor and taken together with the fact  that
      he did not know the name of her first  husband  or  the  date  of  his
      death, a factor which caused the match to be arranged, and nor did  he
      know her telephone number or even part of it, he  concluded  that  the
      appellant had not shown an intention to live with the sponsor  as  man
      and wife.

19.   With regard to the issue of accommodation, the Adjudicator  noted  the
      absence of any environmental health consultants' report,  which  would
      have informed him whether the appellant could indeed  be  accommodated
      as a joint tenant in the sponsor's house and also noted  that  he  had
      been given no idea of the sizes of the rooms in the  house  which  led
      him  to  conclude  that  the  requirement  of  the  rules   concerning
      accommodation had not been satisfied.  As regards  maintenance,  given
      the fact that the sponsor had to feed and  clothe  herself  and  seven
      children, he found it incredible that there was any money left over at
      al land did not consider that the appellant could be maintained out of
      six pounds a week which the account provided showed that  the  sponsor
      saved.  He noted that the sums deposited in the sponsor's bank account
      were deposited by her children,  and  then  removed  by  them  and  he
      concluded that the money  was  not  hers  and  was  not  available  to
      maintain the appellant.

20.   We have before us now the written submissions of the  representatives.
       In addition, we have  three  skeleton  arguments  on  behalf  of  the
      appellant and attached documentation.  The polygamy issue is no longer
      before  us,  and  as  is  agreed,  in  their  representative's  latest
      submissions, the issues before us are firstly the issue of whether the
      couple intend to live together permanently, secondly, whether there is
      adequate financial  support  without  additional  recourse  to  public
      funds,  thirdly,  whether  there  is  adequate  accommodation  without
      recourse to public  funds,  and  fourthly,  whether,  given  that  the
      appellant intends to divide his time equally  between  Bangladesh  and
      the United Kingdom, he can be said to be seeking to be  "admitted  for
      settlement".

21.   We consider first the issue of whether or not  the  couple  intend  to
      live together permanently.  In this regard,  a  particularly  relevant
      issue is the fact that  the  appellant  intends  to  divide  his  time
      effectively equally between Bangladesh, where his  first  wife  lives,
      and the  United  Kingdom  where  the  sponsor  lives.   The  question,
      therefore arises as to whether, in  accordance  with  the  wording  of
      paragraph 281  of  HC  395,  each  of  the  parties  intends  to  live
      permanently with the other, as his or her spouse and the  marriage  is
      subsisting.

22.   In the skeleton argument that Miss Shaw put  in  under  cover  of  her
      letter of 10 December 2003, the  point  is  made  that  under  Section
      33(2A) of the Immigration Act 1971:  "references  to  a  person  being
      settled in the United Kingdom are references to his  being  ordinarily
      resident there..."

23.   she goes on to quote from the decision of the House of Lords  in  Shah
      v Barnet London Borough Council [1983]  1  AER226.   This  is  a  case
      concerning  foreign-born  students  who  had  applied  for,  and  were
      refused, local authority grants for their further education.  They had
      all been resident in the United Kingdom for the requisite period,  but
      in each case, the local education authority claimed that they had  not
      been "ordinarily"  resident,  as  required  by  Section  1(1)  of  the
      Education Act 1962 in order to qualify for a mandatory grant  for  the
      purpose of university study.  At page 235 Lord Scarman concluded  that
      the phrase "ordinarily  resident"  refers  "to  a  man's  abode  in  a
      particular place or country which he has adopted voluntarily, and  for
      settled purposes, as part of the regular order of  his  life  for  the
      time being, whether of long or short duration".

24.   It was said that the construction of the phrase "ordinarily  resident"
      in Section 1 of the 1962 Act, and also in Regulation 13 of  the  Local
      Education Authority Awards Regulations  1979,  was  to  be  considered
      according to its natural and ordinary meaning,  without  reference  to
      the immigration legislation.  The reason why  the  phrase  was  to  be
      construed without reference to the immigration legislation was because
      the material provisions of the Act and regulations made  no  reference
      to any restriction on the awards of grants  based  on  an  applicant's
      place of origin, domicile or nationality.

25.   In the appeal before us, of course the context is very  much  that  of
      immigration, Lord Scarman went on in Shah  to  say  there  must  be  a
      degree of settled purpose, and the purpose may be one, or there may be
      several and it may be specific  or  general.   Miss  Shaw  also  cited
      Secretary of State for the Home Department and Haria [1986] IAR165 and
      R v IAT Ex Parte Ng [1986] IAR 23, as authorities for the  proposition
      that the question is whether, when someone is spending time  way  from
      the United Kingdom they retain substantial  contact  with  the  United
      Kingdom and whether there is a clear and definite intention to return.
       Miss Holmes argued that it is not just the issue of  permanence  that
      is relevant but also the issue of "living" with the other.  She argued
      therefore that it is not just the fact that it must be an  arrangement
      required to be permanent but that the parties have  to  live  together
      permanently as man and wife, which is not possible  when  one  of  the
      parties  to  the  marriage  is  absent  six  months  of  the  year  in
      Bangladesh.

26.   It will be seen  that  none  of  the  authorities  to  which  we  have
      referred are specifically on the point with which we have to deal.  We
      bear in mind the reference also by Lord Scarman, at page 234 in  Shah,
      that the  natural  and  ordinary  meaning  of  the  words  "ordinarily
      resident", is  "that  the  person  must  be  habitually  and  normally
      resident here, apart from temporary or occasional absences of long  or
      short duration".

27.   The matter was considered by Mr  Justice  Collins  in  Chugtai  [1995]
      IAR559, in particular, at pages 567 and 568.  There Collins  J  quoted
      extensively from Shah and made the  point  that  it  was  obviously  a
      question of fact in each case.  He noted the example given in argument
      of a person who had a contract for a definite  period  of  time  which
      might amount to a number of years, to work out of the United  Kingdom,
      which, he concluded would not necessarily  prevent  that  person  from
      being ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom throughout that period
      and that they may might also, at the same time, be ordinarily resident
      wherever it was that they were working  on  the  contract.   In  those
      circumstances, it seemed to him that this person, if they came back to
      the United Kingdom within the two year period (that being the  context
      of the appeal before Collins J) because that was the only way in which
      they could preserve their right to remain in the United Kingdom, would
      be seeking admission on that occasion for the purposes of  settlement.
      He noted also at page 567, that it was perfectly possible for  someone
      to be ordinarily resident in two countries at one and the same time.

28.   It has not been shown to us that the statutory framework or the  legal
      context in which the words "ordinarily resident" are used  requires  a
      different meaning from that considered by Lord Scarman in Shah and  by
      Collins J in Chugtai.  Lord Scarman, at page 235 in  Shah,  emphasised
      that all that was necessary was that the purpose of living  where  one
      did had a sufficient degree of continuity to be properly described  as
      settled.   The  interpretation  placed  on  the   phrase   "ordinarily
      resident" by the House  of  Lords  in  Shah,  is  such  that  we  find
      ourselves bound to conclude that the appellant in this  case  must  be
      properly regarded as a person who is seeking leave to enter the United
      Kingdom with a view to settlement in the United Kingdom.

29.   Can it be said, however, that the couple intend  permanently  to  live
      with each other as each other's spouse?  Can it be said that a  couple
      who intend to be married to each other  but  to  live  apart  for  six
      months of each year intend to live together permanently, each with the
      other as his or her spouse?  Although the arrangement  proposed  would
      appear to be permanent, the living together, clearly, is not  intended
      to be permanent, since it will only happen for six months of the year.
       Obviously the rule cannot properly be interpreted so as to preclude a
      couple who, for example, intend that in the course of their  marriage,
      there might be enforced periods of  separation,  perhaps  because  the
      spouse entering the United Kingdom, would need to go  back  and  visit
      family in their country origin from time  to  time  or  possibly  work
      abroad from time to time, from satisfying its provisions.  We do  not,
      however, consider that an arrangement such as that  proposed  in  this
      case whereby the proposed living arrangement involves an intention  to
      live together for only half of each year in the United Kingdom, due to
      the fact that the appellant proposes to spend the other half  of  each
      year with his first wife in Bangladesh, can be regarded  as  involving
      an intention to live permanently with each  other.   The  appeal,  is,
      accordingly, dismissed on this point.

30.   Otherwise, with regard to the issue of intention to live together,  we
      have noted above the Adjudicator's reasoning in this regard.  Clearly,
      as Miss Shaw points out in her submissions, the birth of the child  is
      a very relevant factor in this regard.  On the other hand,  there  are
      the various matters that troubled the Adjudicator concerning  lack  of
      knowledge of relevant matters which implied a lack of interest in  the
      sponsor and in the marriage.  Against that, on the other hand, is  the
      fact that they are fist cousins and  there  is  clearly  a  degree  of
      cultural impetus in favour of the marriage.  On balance, the  Tribunal
      considers that on this  purely  factual  issue,  had  we  not  decided
      against the appellant on  the  legal  point,  the  evidence  shows  on
      balance that there is an intention on a factual basis to live together
      on the part of the couple.  As we say, however, that is irrelevant  in
      the light of our finding on the point of law, discussed above.

31.   We turn to the question  of  maintenance.   The  evidence  before  the
      Adjudicator was that the sponsor saves ï¿½25 a month and has savings  of
      just over ï¿½1,000.00.  As the  Adjudicator  pointed  out,  however,  it
      appeared that the sums deposited in the sponsor's  bank  account  were
      put there by her children and then removed by them, and  he  concluded
      that it was not money available to maintain  the  appellant.   In  the
      view of the Tribunal, the Adjudicator was entitled to  find  that  the
      twenty five pounds a month saved by the sponsor, and as it would seem,
      evidenced, at least, in part, by the savings she has  accumulated,  is
      not such, as to enable the requirements of the immigration rules to be
      satisfied.  It is a very small amount from which to maintain an adult.
       We do not consider that there is force  in  the  contention  of  Miss
      Shaw's submissions that the appellant was in the past  offered  a  job
      and that he might obtain work in the restaurant industry on the  basis
      of the Sectors Based Scheme on which information  is  provided  in  an
      annex to Miss Shaw's submissions.  The fact that  these  opportunities
      exist by no means indicates that on a balance of probabilities it  has
      been shown that the appellant would succeed  in  availing  himself  of
      such an opportunity.  We therefore  dismiss  the  appeal  as  concerns
      maintenance.

32.   The next issue  is  that  of  accommodation.   We  have  derived  some
      assistance from the decision in Thompson which again  was  annexed  to
      Miss Shaw's submissions  where  it  was  conceded  by  the  Presenting
      Officer that if accommodation  were  not  statutorily  overcrowded  by
      reason of an appellant coming to join  a  sponsor,  the  accommodation
      would be adequate for the purposes of the  rules.   We  consider  that
      that concession was properly made, and are of the  view  that  it  has
      equal relevance to the case put before us.  We  therefore  allow  this
      appeal as concerns accommodation.

34.   The final issue is that of Article 8 of the Human  Rights  Convention.
      Here it is contended that that Article, in conjunction with Article 14
      would be breached, because the immigration rules unduly impact  o  the
      appellant, due to his religion, which dictates  that  he  divides  his
      time equally between his two wives.  The tribunal has not had drawn to
      its  attention  any  evidence  to  support  the  contention  that  the
      appellant's religion dictates that he so spend  his  time.   There  is
      mention at paragraph 13 of an earlier skeleton argument of Miss Shaw's
      that there is an obligation under the  Quran  that  though  polygamous
      marriages are permitted, the wives are to be treated equally.   We  do
      not read that as importing a  requirement  that  a  man  such  as  the
      appellant married to two wives has to spend six  months  of  the  year
      with each of them.  It is an interpretation that he proposes  to  make
      rather than a mandatory requirement, on the face of it.

34.   Otherwise, the argument concerning  Article  8  is  that  a  permanent
      separation of husband and wife would  be  disproportionate  and  would
      constitute a breach of Article 8.  In this context however has  to  be
      borne  in  mind  the  very  relevant  factor  of  the  importance   of
      maintaining a fair and proper system of immigration control.  This  is
      an important aspect of that balance.  It is open to the  appellant  to
      apply to visit his wife in the United Kingdom and equally, there is no
      evidence to show that it  is  impossible  to  seek  to  visit  him  in
      Bangladesh, although we accept that in  her  financial  circumstances,
      there might be difficulties of some significance.  However, we do  not
      consider that it can properly be said, that refusing  entry  clearance
      in this case would comprise a disproportionate interference  with  the
      appellant's Article 8 rights.

35.   For the reasons stated above, therefore, this appeal is dismissed.
