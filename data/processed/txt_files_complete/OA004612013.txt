               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Singer, Counsel, instructed by Haq Hamilton
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms Everett, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals with  permission  against  the  determination  of
    First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Thorne  promulgated  on  9  November  2013
    dismissing his appeal against the decision of the  respondent  dated  5
    November 2012 to refuse him entry clearance to the  United  Kingdom  to
    join his parents pursuant to paragraph 301 of the Immigration Rules.

 2. This matter seriously came before me on 19 December 2013 when, for  the
    reasons set out in the decision of that date, I found that there was an
    error of law in the determination of Judge Thorne and  gave  directions
    as to how the decision was to be remade.  A copy of  that  decision  is
    attached to this determination as an annexe

 3. The sole issue here is, as both Ms Everett for the  respondent  and  Mr
    Singer for the appellant accepted, a narrow one: does the sponsor  have
    sufficient income to support the appellant such that there would  be  a
    no additional recourse to public funds.  It is not disputed  that  this
    is to be determined in line with Ahmed [2013] UKUT 84 (IAC) at [11]:-


       11. As adequacy of accommodation was out of  the  picture  following
       the earlier decision, the present hearing was concerned solely  with
       the maintenance requirement.  Expressed mathematically, the  formula
       to be fulfilled is


       A - B ? C[1]


       where:


       A is the projected income
       B what needs to be spent on accommodation and
       C the income support (or equivalent) figure (which we term  in  this
       decision "the benefit threshold")

 4. Both representatives  were  in  agreement  that  this  was  the  proper
    approach to be followed.  They were also agreed that it was appropriate
    as the starting point when assessing the sponsor's income to average it
    over the six months prior to the date of decision and, for the purposes
    of benefit calculations, to express that figure as a weekly amount.

 5. The sponsor has two sources of employment: Compass Group  Security  and
    G4S Security.  In addition to that, he is in receipt of  child  benefit
    at the rate of �188.40 per month.  That is not in dispute.

 6. As Mr Singer accepted, the  total  figures  for  income  given  in  the
    schedule include payments which straddle the  date  of  decision  given
    that the sponsor is paid in arrears.  It is  evident  from  the  papers
    from G4S that the pay is calculated on a calendar month basis and  then
    paid approximately fifteen days into the next month.

 7. I do not consider that these sums could therefore be taken into account
    given that the income, although relating to a period before the date of
    decision was not in fact received by the sponsor prior  to  that  date.
    On that basis, the relevant income for the 6 month period is �13,410.15
    which amounts to �515.78 per week assuming 6 months is 26 weeks.

 8. From this weekly income has to be deducted the applicable rent which in
    this case is �330 per fortnight or �165 per  week.   Therefore  on  the
    basis of the formula in Ahmed, it is necessary for the applicable level
    of income support (or equivalent) figure must be greater than �350.78.

 9. Ms Everett  submitted  that  the  appropriate  basis  for  the  benefit
    threshold should be that established in KA (Pakistan), that is,  adding
    the family premium and the relevant premium for  each  child  under  18
    (including the appellant) to the applicable amount  of  income  support
    payable to a couple.

10. Mr Singer submitted that on the contrary,  the  appropriate  method  of
    calculating the benefit threshold  is  adding  the  child  tax  credits
    payable in respect of the children to the income support payable to the
    couple, as family  premiums  in  respect  of  children  are  no  longer
    payable.

11. The starting point with any assessment must be the level of benefits to
    which the particular family in question would be  entitled  as  at  the
    date of decision. The rationale underlying KA(Pakistan) is that no  one
    should be expected to live  on  an  income  less  than  what  has  been
    established by  the  government  as  the  minimum  level  on  which  an
    individual ( or a family) can be expected to live.  That, certainly  at
    the time of KA (Pakistan) was calculated by reference to income support
    levels.  As has been recognised, the situation has now moved  on  since
    2004.

12. As currently constituted, the family premium which  was  payable  under
    income support in respect of each child under 18 and  which  was  taken
    into account in KA (Pakistan) has not been available since  April  2004
    for new claimants unless the claim began before 6 April  2004  and  the
    child was included in that claim before 2004 and he had  not  yet  been
    awarded child tax credit.

13. On that basis it would be an entirely artificial exercise  to  consider
    the income support figure on the basis of adding the applicable  amount
    for a couple to the child premium amounts payable for each of the three
    children who were in this case part of the family and were  aged  under
    18.

14. In the circumstances therefore I am persuaded that, in line with  Ahmed
    the appropriate means for calculating the relevant  amount  of  support
    that is of the benefit threshold, is on the assumption that  child  tax
    credit would be payable to the family.

15. The applicable figures derived from the grounds of appeal  (subject  to
    the correction made by Mr Singer to the amount of income support) are:

         Income support             �111.45

     Child tax credit           �170.83

     Child benefit              �60.50

     Total                 �342.78

16. On that basis, in this case, applying the  correct  benefit  threshold,
    and taking into account the arrival of the appellant, the  sponsor  has
    sufficient income available such  that  he  satisfies  the  Immigration
    Rules as to the adequacy of maintenance  and  accommodation,  it  being
    accepted that there is sufficient accommodation available to the family
    which is not overcrowded.

17. Accordingly, for the reasons set out above  the  determination  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal did involve the making of an error of law and I set
    it aside.  I remake the determination by allowing the appeal under  the
    Immigration Rules.

18. As I have allowed  the  appeal  under  the  Immigration  Rules,  it  is
    unnecessary for me to consider whether the appeal should be allowed  on
    article 8 grounds, or on any other grounds.

SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS

    1. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the  making
       of an error of law and I set it aside.

    2. I remake the decision by allowing the appeal under  the  immigration
       rules.

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr J Singer, Counsel, instructed by Haq Hamilton
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr J Whitwell, Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals with  permission  against  the  determination  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge  Thorne  promulgated  on  9  September  2013,
    dismissing  the  appellant's  appeal  against  the  decision   by   the
    respondent made on 5 November 2012 to refuse him entry clearance to the
    United Kingdom to join his mother and father ("the  sponsor")  pursuant
    to paragraph 301 of the Immigration Rules.

 2. The appellant was born on 1 April 1995 and is a  citizen  of  Pakistan.
    His father, Mukhtar Ahmed, lives and works in the United Kingdom.   The
    appellant's mother, Zulekha Ahmed and three of the appellant's siblings
    live in London.

 3. The appellant's case is that as at the  date  of  decision  his  father
    earned sufficient money to maintain him and provide  accommodation  for
    him in the United Kingdom with the rest of the family  which  would  be
    adequate and this would be  achieved  without  there  being  additional
    recourse to public funds.

 4. Although the application was lodged on 16 August 2012, it was not until
    26 November 2012 that the  respondent  refused  the  application.   The
    respondent concluded:-

      i) in the absence of any mention of the appellant's  mother,  that  he
         was not seeking to join or accompany her;

     ii) that the family would require a total of �453.80 per week in  order
         to maintain them in line with income  support  rates  that,  taking
         this with the �165 rent per week that the sponsor  would  therefore
         require �618.80 per week  to  support  his  family,  equivalent  to
         �32,177.60 income, considerably more than the �2,333 per month  net
         income claimed;

    iii) that he was not satisfied  that  the  sponsor  could  maintain  and
         accommodate the appellant without recourse to public funds.

 5. The appeal against that decision came before Judge  Thorne  sitting  at
    Hatton Cross on 23 August 2013.  The appellant was represented on  this
    occasion by the sponsor but  not  by  any  legal  representative.   The
    respondent conceded the relationship  between  the  appellant  and  his
    mother and that the only  live  issues  related  to  accommodation  and
    maintenance [16].   Judge  Thorne,  after  hearing  evidence  from  the
    sponsor and considering documents adduced by him found:-

      i) that there was no adequate evidence such as an independent  housing
         report of  the  availability  of  suitable  accommodation  for  the
         appellant in the UK[26];

     ii) that on the sponsor's evidence he would have been residing with his
         wife and four children and, at DWP rates, would require net  yearly
         income of �32,177.60 for maintenance substantially greater than his
         stated gross income of �29,927.40 [28];

    iii) there was no reliable evidence of the sponsor receiving  any  money
         from his elder son  or  that  the  credit  surpluses  in  the  bank
         accounts were genuinely funds available to him;

     iv) that the decision  was  not  in  breach  of  the  United  Kingdom's
         obligations pursuant to Article 8 of the  Human  Rights  Convention
         [32]; and

      v) therefore the matter fell to be dismissed on all grounds.

 6. The appellant and sponsor then instructed Haq Hamilton  Solicitors  who
    applied on the appellant's behalf for permission to appeal submitting:-

      i) that the judge made a material error in failing  to  apply  KA  and
         Others (Adequacy of maintenance) Pakistan [2006]  UKAIT  00065  and
         the principles as laid down in Uvovo (00 TH 01450); [3];

     ii) that the judge made a material error of fact with  respect  to  the
         correct calculations of the theoretical income in  respect  of  the
         relevant level of income support given that the relevant level  was
         not by calculating the number of children  dependent  for  whom  an
         allowance is payable in respect of income support but rather on the
         basis that, as is now the case, the applicable level of  child  tax
         credit payable to a family where both parents  are  in  receipt  of
         income support  [4]  that  figure  being  [17]  �170.83  per  week,
         including child benefit, that would be paid to the family would  be
         �337.28 per week [22];

    iii) that even accounting for the  rent  paid  [24]  the  sponsor's  net
         income  was  �376.84  a  week  and  therefore  there  would  be  no
         additional recourse to public funds were the appellant to join  his
         family;

     iv) that the respondent had failed properly to apply Section 55 of  the
         UK Borders Act [28].

 7. On 6 November 2013 Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Latter  granted  permission,
    stating that:

         "It is arguable that the First-tier Tribunal may have erred in  law
         in its assessment of whether  the  appellant  would  be  adequately
         maintained and by failing to give adequate reasons for finding that
         the accommodation requirements of the Rules were not met".

 8. The respondent replied to that pursuant to Rule  24  stating  that  the
    judge had made reasoned findings that the income was not sufficient and
    that there was apparently  an  unchallenged  finding  on  accommodation
    being inadequate.

 9. Mr Singer submitted that the  judge  had  erred  with  respect  to  his
    assessment of the adequacy of maintenance.  Firstly, as  there  was  no
    indication in the refusal notice that what was in issue was the size of
    the accommodation but rather whether there was sufficient funds to meet
    the cost.  He submitted further that  the  judge  had  erred  in  there
    requiring to be or appearing to require a property report.  Mr Whitwell
    accepted that the judge's analysis of the accommodation was  flawed  in
    that it appeared not to take into account  the  fact  that  there  were
    three  rooms  available  and  that  they  would  accordingly   not   be
    statutorily overcrowded.  He submitted that, however,  this  error  was
    not material as the judge's analysis of the  income  available  to  the
    family was one open to him.

10. I am mindful of the fact that the sponsor for  reasons  best  known  to
    himself was not legally represented before Judge Thorne, a fact  which,
    given the complexity of the issues regarding the calculation of benefit
    was at best ill-advised.

11. The respondent appears to  have  reached  the  figure  quoted  for  the
    relevant level of income support on the basis of a calculation assuming
    that there would be an allowance under income support for each  of  the
    appellant's four siblings as they were living with the  parents.   That
    assumption was incorrect and as was accepted  by  the  judge  that  the
    older child was not living with the family and second  because  at  the
    relevant date the child was over the age of 18.  It is also unfortunate
    that the judge did not  refer  either  to  Ahmed  (benefits:  proof  of
    receipt; evidence) [2013] UKUT 00084 (IAC) or  for  that  matter  Yarce
    (maintenance: benefit)  [2012]  UKUT  00045  (IAC)  given  that  it  is
    generally accepted, the situation and the means by which  benefits  are
    calculated has moved on and become considerably more complex since  the
    decision in KA was promulgated.  The correct approach  is  set  out  in
    Ahmed at 11:
       11. As adequacy of accommodation was out of  the  picture  following
       the earlier decision, the present hearing was concerned solely  with
       the maintenance requirement.  Expressed mathematically, the  formula
       to be fulfilled is


       A - B ? C[1]


       where:


       A is the projected income
       B what needs to be spent on accommodation and
       C the income support (or equivalent) figure (which we term  in  this
       decision "the benefit threshold")

12. In this case, the sponsor's net income  plus  the  child  benefit  paid
    should have been added together, the  cost  of  rent  and  council  tax
    deducted and the benefit threshold  calculated.   In  Ahmed  the  Upper
    Tribunal said at [27]:-

         This calculation  in  the  form  put  forward  [difficulties  using
         figures in respect of allowances for each dependent child]  is  not
         without its conceptual difficulties,  although  they  may  be  more
         theoretical than real.  The  system  of  support  for  families  on
         benefit with children has largely moved on and will continue to  do
         so.   The  calculations  as  submitted  to  us   are   sufficiently
         consistent for KA for present purposes and we  are  satisfied  that
         other, more contemporary, ways of approaching the calculation (such
         as using child tax credit figures) would not lead to  a  materially
         different income when construing the benefit  threshold.   However,
         while we are satisfied with the present method of carrying out  the
         calculations is a valid one in the circumstances of this  case,  we
         are not intending to hold it out as a model  or  to  exclude  other
         methods of calculation in respect to the KA principle while perhaps
         being more consistent with the reality of the benefit system as  it
         now is or indeed how it may evolve in the future.

13. In fairness to the respondent and to Judge Thorne, none of this was put
    to him but it is incumbent on a judge  to  follow  relevant  case  law.
    That said, I am satisfied that he may, as the grounds put forward, have
    misdirected himself with respect to the  means  by  which  adequacy  of
    maintenance is calculated in failing to apply Yarce or Ahmed  as  noted
    above.  I am satisfied  also  that  an  error  of  fact  arose  in  the
    calculation of the relevant DWP figure in that the judge has failed  to
    give reasons why he adopted that calculation (including  an  additional
    child) rather than other models as canvassed in Ahmed.  That does  not,
    however,  mean  that  the  error  was  material  but  turning  to   the
    alternative method of calculation, that is on the basis  of  child  tax
    credit, set out in the grounds of appeal at [21].

14. The net income for the sponsor is unclear given  that  the  P60s  given
    relates to the tax year ending 5  April  2012,  more  than  six  months
    before the date of decision. There was little evidence put  before  the
    Tribunal as regards the sponsor's income as at the  date  of  decision.
    There was only partial coverage of subsequent income by means  of  wage
    slips.  Taking the figures given by the sponsor at their  highest,  the
    income disclosed was �29.927.40.  On the basis of the tax and  national
    insurance rates payable in the tax year 2011/12  the  gross  income  of
    �29.927.40 equates to a net income of �436.77 per week.  To  that  must
    be added child benefit of �60 a week.  It is not necessary  to  include
    the figure for child benefit in this given that this figure would  also
    have to be added to the calculation of the relevant  level  of  benefit
    payable.  The difference in income is therefore  even  on  the  figures
    given to the judge, greater than the rent payable.

15. It follows on this basis that the  judge  could  have  reached  another
    figure with regards to income even on the basis of the figures that  he
    accepted.

16. In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the judge's error with regard
    to the calculation of income was material in that there could,  on  the
    basis of the figures before him, have been another outcome.

17. It is therefore necessary to remake the decision with  respect  to  the
    calculation of the adequacy of  income  with  regard  to  the  date  of
    decision. It is not, however, possible to do so on  the  basis  of  the
    material supplied I therefore direct that the matter be reconvened  for
    a further hearing on this issue in accordance with the directions which
    follow.

Directions

    1. That the appellant prepare an schedule of the sponsor's  income  and
       expenditure for the period of the six months prior to  the  date  of
       decision, including details of any benefits received by  him  and/or
       his wife and children;

    2. The schedule is to be accompanied by an indexed bundle of  documents
       establishing the various items of income and expenditure set out  in
       the aforementioned  schedule;  and,  copies  of  the  relevant  bank
       statements including (if relied upon) savings;

    3. These documents are to be served on the respondent and on the  Upper
       Tribunal at least 5 working days before the next hearing.
