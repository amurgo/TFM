For the Secretary of State:     Mr M Diwnycz, Senior Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. Mr Mohammad Monirul Hassan is a national  of  Bangladesh  born  on  1st
    October 1977.  On 4th February 2010 he was granted leave to  enter  the
    UK as a student.  His leave was valid until 14th May 2011.  On 6th July
    2011 he was granted further  leave  to  remain  in  the  UK  until  3rd
    February 2012.  On 15th May 2012 he was further granted leave to remain
    in the UK until 15th September 2012 as a Tier 4 (General) Student.   He
    completed his course of study on 15th September 2012 and on  that  date
    submitted a combined application for leave to remain in  the  UK  as  a
    Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant under the points-based system and  for  a
    biometric residence permit.  Those applications  were  refused  by  the
    Secretary of State on  29th  May  2013.   The  Respondent  successfully
    appealed to the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Doyle), in  a  determination
    that was  promulgated  on  14th  November  2013  on  the  papers.   The
    Secretary of State now appeals that determination.

 2. Paragraph 245DD  of  the  Immigration  Rules  (HC  395)  sets  out  the
    requirements an applicant must satisfy to qualify for leave  to  remain
    as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant.   For  this  appeal,  the  relevant
    requirement is found at paragraph 245DD(b):

         "The applicant must have a minimum of 75 points under paragraphs 35
         to 53 of Appendix A."

    Paragraph 36 of Appendix A provides that the available points  are  set
    out in Table 4.  The basis upon which the application  was  refused  is
    set out in the notice of immigration decision dated 29th May 2013.   It
    was noted that the Respondent had claimed 25 points for  having  access
    to funds as required under Appendix A of the Immigration Rules but that
    the Secretary of State was not satisfied that he had produced specified
    documents required so as to be awarded points in this area.  There were
    two reasons given in relation to his application which was based on his
    claim to have access to funds of 200,000 being made available to him by
    his spouse Mrs Rokeya Hassan.  Firstly it was stated that  he  did  not
    sign the declaration for the provision of third party funds as required
    under paragraph 41-SD(b)(i) and secondly, he did not provide  a  letter
    from  a  legal  representative  to  validate  the  signatures  on   the
    declaration for the provision of third party funds, as  required  under
    paragraph 41-SD(b)(ii).  It is plain from  the  refusal  document  that
    those were the only matters raised in  respect  of  that  part  of  the
    application.

 3. Mr Hassan, the Respondent sought to appeal that decision  and  provided
    Grounds of Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.  In those grounds it  was
    stated  at  paragraph  2  that  the  declaration  contained   all   the
    information that was required showing the lawyer's name,  address,  his
    practising jurisdiction, his confirmation  to  the  validation  of  the
    declaration, the date of it, the name of the third party  with  address
    and the name of the applicant with address, official stamp  et  cetera.
    It was noted that it was signed by the third party and validated by the
    lawyer which was the main objective.  As to the  second  issue  it  was
    stated that the signature on the declaration was a "minor omission" but
    that the declaration contained all the  information  required  to  show
    that the fund was available to  the  applicant  from  the  third  party
    namely his wife.  He further submitted  that  the  Secretary  of  State
    should have made a simple enquiry about his signature before making the
    refusal decision based on what he described as a "minor formation error
    of the document" according to their own  policy  guidance  set  out  at
    paragraph 17 of  the  Tier  1  Entrepreneur  policy  guidance  and  the
    evidential flexibility policy.

 4. The appeal came before the First-tier Tribunal  (Judge  Doyle)  on  the
    papers on 11th November 2013.  In a determination promulgated  on  14th
    November 2013 he considered the  bundle  of  documents  that  had  been
    produced on behalf of the Appellant in the light of the matters set out
    in the refusal letter.  In respect of the two issues raised  the  judge
    set out his conclusions at paragraphs 12(a to g).  He had noted earlier
    in the determination that the third party whose funds were relevant for
    this application was the Appellant's wife resident in  Bangladesh.   He
    noted at paragraph 11(c) that she maintained a bank  account  with  the
    Janata Bank in Dhaka and at the date  of  the  application  the  credit
    balance on the account was �227,522.  On 12th September  2012  she  had
    sworn a declaration that �200,000 was available from her  bank  account
    as an initial investment in her husband's business in  the  UK.   In  a
    letter of the same date, Mohamed Shafiqul Islam, an advocate and notary
    public from Dhaka, notarised that  declaration.   The  bank  statements
    that were  produced  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  were  noted  at
    paragraph 11(f) namely that for the period of 18th  July  2012  to  2nd
    September 2012 confirmed  that  the  credit  balance  in  that  account
    exceeded �227,000.  He further noted at  11(g)  that  the  Janata  Bank
    Limited is the second largest commercial  bank  in  Bangladesh  and  is
    owned by the government of Bangladesh and was  also  regulated  by  the
    Bangladesh Bank.

 5. The judge noted at paragraph 12(a) that the case related to  the  funds
    available from a third party and thus paragraph  41-SD(b)(i)  and  (ii)
    applied.  He noted that the "Respondent's criticism is that of the nine
    requirements set out there, the Appellant did not sign the  declaration
    for the provision of third party funds, and did not  provide  a  letter
    from  a  legal  representative  to  validate  the  signature   of   the
    declaration."  The judge recorded the following:-

         "(b) The Respondent is  incorrect  about  the  second  observation.
             Contained in the papers before me there is  a  letter  from  a
             practising advocate in Bangladesh  confirming  the  method  of
             signature of the declaration and that the signature  is  valid
             in Bangladeshi law.  The author of that letter is  the  notary
             public who notarised the affidavit.  However the Respondent is
             correct  that  the  Appellant's  signature  is  not   on   the
             declaration.  At page 2 of  the  declaration  the  information
             required by the  Immigration  Rules  is  set  out.   Name  and
             address of the filing  lawyer  is  produced,  details  of  his
             practising jurisdiction, and confirmation of the validation of
             the declaration are set  out,  along  with  the  date  of  the
             declaration, the name of the third  party  with  address,  the
             name of the applicant with address  and  so  on.   It  is  not
             disputed that the Appellant's signature is  missing  from  the
             declaration.

         (c)  It is not surprising that the Appellant's signature is missing
             from the declaration because  the  declaration  was  sworn  in
             Dhaka.   The  declaration  is  not  the  declaration  of   the
             Appellant, but the declaration of his wife (the third  party).
             The Immigration Rules quite clearly state that  the  applicant
             should sign the declaration.  The question for me  is  whether
             or not  the  absence  of  the  applicant's  signature  on  the
             declaration (that is not his) is fatal to the application."

 6. The judge went on to state that the Secretary  of  State  had  made  no
    attempts to contact the  Appellant  so  that  his  signature  could  be
    appended to a document that would otherwise fulfil the requirements  of
    the Immigration Rule.  The  judge  made  reference  to  the  evidential
    flexibility policy under the points-based system which was incorporated
    into the Rules at paragraph 245AA on 6th September 2012.  He also  made
    reference to the case of Rodriguez  (flexibility  policy)  [2013]  UKUT
    00042 (IAC) and the discretionary powers to request further information
    from applicants in any case and the exercise thereof in accordance with
    established legal principles.  At paragraph 12(f) he made reference  to
    the Tier 1 Entrepreneur policy guidance which placed an  obligation  on
    the Respondent to contact the Appellant if there was an  error  in  the
    documentary evidence.  He thus found that on the evidence placed before
    him the Secretary of State had not followed her own policy  guidelines.
    At paragraph (g) the judge said this:-

         "I consider the evidence that is  placed  before  me.   It  is  not
         disputed that the Appellant's spouse is able to provide  access  to
         �200,000 to fund the Appellant's proposed business.  In reality the
         Respondent  has  refused  this  application  solely  on   a   minor
         technicality.  The reason to refuse is something that could  easily
         have been remedied, but  the  Respondent  chose  not  to  seek  the
         remedy."

    He reached the conclusion that having taken into account the  terms  of
    the Immigration Rules and the evidence and having taken a "holistic and
    balanced view of the evidence"  he  reached  the  conclusion  that  the
    Appellant fulfilled the requirements of the Immigration Rules.  Thus he
    allowed the appeal under the Rules.

 7. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal that decision on two
    grounds and permission was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Blandy
    on 5th December 2013.

 8. Mr Diwnycz on behalf of the Secretary of State relied upon the grounds.
     He submitted that on the findings of fact made by the judge and having
    reached the conclusion that this  was  a  case  that  fell  within  the
    evidential flexibility guidelines or policy he should not have  allowed
    the appeal outright but should have allowed the appeal  to  the  extent
    that it was not in accordance with the law and remitted the appeal back
    to the Secretary of State and thus made a material error  of  law.   Mr
    Hosein on behalf of the Appellant was in agreement with the  submission
    made by Mr Diwnycz that the judge, on the findings of fact that he made
    by reaching the conclusion that there had  been  a  minor  technicality
    which, had the  Secretary  of  State  applied  the  flexibility  policy
    correctly that it would have been open to Mr Hassan to remedy it before
    refusing the application, would have required the judge to have allowed
    the appeal only to the extent of remitting it back to the Secretary  of
    State.

 9. It is common ground between the parties that on the  findings  of  fact
    made by the judge, that he fell  into  error  by  allowing  the  appeal
    outright rather than allowing the appeal to  the  extent  that  it  was
    remitted to the Secretary of  State.   In  those  circumstances  it  is
    accepted that an error of law is  established  and  that  the  decision
    allowing the appeal should be set aside  and  be  remade  allowing  the
    appeal to the extent that it is remitted to the Secretary of  State  to
    allow the applicant to rectify the errors identified  relating  to  his
    signature.  Mr Diwnycz on behalf of the Secretary  of  State  does  not
    seek to challenge any of the findings of fact made  by  the  judge  nor
    does he seek  to  argue  that  the  evidential  flexibility  policy  or
    paragraph 245AA does not apply in the way the judge found it  to  apply
    in this particular case.

10. The judge  reached  the  conclusion  from  the  evidence  that  he  was
    satisfied that the applicant had provided  bank  statements  from  18th
    July 2012 to 2nd September 2012 confirming a credit balance  of  a  sum
    exceeding �227,000 (see paragraph 11(f)) and that his wife, whose  name
    the third party funds were in, had sworn a declaration to  that  effect
    and that in all other respects the declaration met the requirements  of
    the Rules.  However it was common ground that the applicant's signature
    was not on the declaration (see paragraph 12(b) of the  determination).
    That is accepted also by Mr Hosein.  Whilst the judge found that it was
    not surprising that his signature  was  missing  from  the  declaration
    because the declaration was sworn in Dhaka and that the declaration was
    not the declaration of the applicant but that of his  wife,  the  Rules
    did require the declaration to be signed by him (see paragraph  12(c)).
    The judge however reached the conclusion that this was a case where the
    difficulties with the documents were such that  in  terms  of  applying
    evidential flexibility  or  in  the  alternative  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 245AA, that this was the type of document  that  should  have
    triggered a request from the Secretary of State but  that  it  had  not
    happened on the facts of this case, which the judge  found  did  apply.
    Mr Diwnycz does not seek to challenge the findings made by the judge in
    respect of whether or not the evidential flexibility policy  did  apply
    or paragraph 245AA and thus I proceed on the  basis  that  this  was  a
    proper finding made by the judge.

11. That related to his signature on the declaration, however it  seems  to
    me that this omission also extended to the validation of the  signature
    on the declaration by the legal representative.   The  judge  did  find
    that the letter from the practising advocate  in  Bangladesh  confirmed
    the method of signature of the declaration and the signature was  valid
    in Bangladeshi law (see paragraph 12(b)).   As  the  judge  found,  the
    Appellant's signature was not on the document and it follows  that  the
    notary therefore could not have validated his signature.  If there  was
    an omission which the applicant should  have  had  the  opportunity  to
    rectify it extends to that document also as it concerns the same  issue
    namely the Appellant's missing signature.   Therefore  the  appropriate
    course is to set aside the decision to allow the appeal outright and to
    substitute in its place a decision to allow the appeal  to  the  extent
    that it is remitted to the Secretary of State to give the Appellant the
    opportunity to rectify that omission before a decision is taken.

Decision

12. The making of the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
    making of an error of law.  The decision  is  remade  as  follows,  the
    appeal is allowed to the extent that it is remitted to the Secretary of
    State.
