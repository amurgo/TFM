For the claimant: Mr G Lee, instructed by Deanmason LLP Solicitors
For the appellant:     Mr I Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This  is  the  appeal  of  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  against  the
    determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal   Judge   Kempton   promulgated
    14.11.14, allowing on Article 8 grounds the claimant's  appeal  against
    the decision of the Entry Clearance Officer, dated 30.8.13,  to  refuse
    entry clearance to  the  United  Kingdom  for  family  reunion  as  the
    daughter of a refugee, pursuant to paragraph 352D  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.  The Judge heard the appeal on 29.10.14.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Cox granted permission to appeal on 8.1.15.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 16.2.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Kempton should be set aside.

 5. The grounds of application for permission to  appeal  submit  that  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal was flawed by: the giving of weight
    to immaterial matters (in two instances);  failing  properly  to  apply
    relevant case law; misdirection in  law;  and  in  failing  to  provide
    adequate reasons for material findings.

 6. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Cox granted permission  on  all
    grounds but specifically found that it was arguable that the First-tier
    Tribunal Judge materially misdirected himself  in  law  by  failing  to
    consider the Immigration Rules relating  to  Article  8  claims  before
    going on to make an Article 8 assessment outside the Rules.  Judge  Cox
    also found that the judge arguably failed to adequately explain why the
    several factors identified in  the  claimant's  favour  outweighed  the
    legitimate public interest in removal. Further, the finding at  �16  to
    the effect that in the past year the claimant's "symptoms have worsened
    and now require  intervention,"  is  not  supported  by  the  preceding
    discussion of the medical evidence from �15. It is clear from �19  that
    very significant weight was attached to the purported worsening of  the
    claimant's medical condition.

 7. I find that the determination is flawed in some, but not  all,  of  the
    respects asserted in the grounds  of  appeal,  directly  affecting  the
    validity of the Article 8 assessment. The only  part  of  the  decision
    that can stand is the finding at �18 that the claimant  does  not  meet
    the requirements of paragraph 352D for entry clearance to join a parent
    with refugee status. That part of the decision has  not  been  appealed
    and Mr Lee accepted that the  claimant  could  not  succeed  under  the
    family reunion provisions.

 8. First and most significantly,  I  note  that  from  �18  onwards  Judge
    Kempton proceeded to consider the Article 8 ECHR  claim  following  the
    Razgar steps, but omitted to consider  that  part  of  the  Immigration
    Rules which  specifically  addresses  family  life  claims.  The  judge
    properly considered  paragraph  352D  and  recognised  that  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer's reliance on 352A was incorrect. However, the  judge
    failed to consider whether the claimant could meet  the  provisions  of
    Appendix FM, such section EC-DR, entry clearance as an adult  dependant
    relative. That failure invalidates the subsequent Article 8 assessment,
    since it is only necessary to consider the claim outside the  Rules  if
    the Rules are not met. As stated in R (Ganesabalan) v SSHD [2014]  EWHC
    2712 (Admin), "The Immigration Rules are the important first stage  and
    the focus of Article 8 assessments. Indeed it will be an error  of  law
    not to address Article 8 by reference to  the  Rules,"  reliance  being
    placed on Halleemudeen v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 558.

 9. In considering  this  issue,  Mr  Lee  submitted  that  the  judge  had
    effectively considered the Rules by the assessment of paragraph 352D. I
    do not accept that argument. The purpose of Appendix FM,  as  explained
    in GEN1.1 is to set out "the requirements to be met and, in considering
    applications under this route, it reflects how, under Article 8 of  the
    Human Rights Convention, the balance will be struck between  the  right
    to respect for private and family  life  and  the  legitimate  aims  of
    protecting national security, public safety and the economic well-being
    of the UK," etc.

10. Whilst the claimant has a heart problem and requires a  pacemaker,  she
    has no entitlement to free medical treatment  in  the  UK.  Whilst  the
    quality of medical  services  available  to  her  in  Pakistan  may  be
    inferior to those of the  UK,  appropriate  treatment  is  nevertheless
    available. Her father admitted in evidence that there  was  nothing  to
    prevent him going back to be with her during medical treatment.  Whilst
    medical circumstances may be relevant in the round with other  evidence
    in an Article 8 assessment, it would have been relevant to clarify in a
    balanced proportionality decision whether the medical  conditions  were
    sufficient to meet the requirements for an  adult  dependant  relative,
    which is the level the Secretary of State considers  as  the  threshold
    level of care needed to overcome the public  interest  in  the  balance
    between the private and family life rights of  an  adult  relative  and
    that public interest in immigration control.

11. One of the difficulties with the decision of the First-tier Tribunal is
    that the judge appears to have forgotten that this is an out of country
    case and therefore that the relevant circumstances  to  be  considered,
    whether under the Rules or Article  8  outside  the  Rules,  are  those
    prevailing at the date of decision, 30.8.13, and not those at the  date
    of hearing. I note from the careful handwritten record  of  proceedings
    that the oral evidence did not address this important  distinction.   I
    also note that even at the date of application the claimant was already
    19  years  of  age,  an  important  factor  to  have  been  taken  into
    consideration.

12. In that light, I agree with the complaint in the grounds of reliance on
    alleged worsening in the claimant's  symptoms  over  the  'past  year.'
    Further, it is difficult to decipher from the  decision  what  evidence
    was relied on. However, Mr Lee was able to  point  me  to  the  medical
    examination at A39 dated 19.10.14,  suggesting,  apparently,  that  the
    claimant needed a pacemaker. I also note from the  oral  evidence  that
    the claimant had decided not to proceed with a  pacemaker.  Her  letter
    states that she is fine but lonely. If the evidence does  amount  to  a
    worsening  of  symptoms,  it  was  not   directly   relevant   to   the
    circumstances prevailing at the date of decision.  Whilst  the  present
    circumstances  may  be  compassionate,  engendering  sympathy,  it   is
    difficult to understand why the judge  placed  such  reliance  on  this
    issue in the Article 8 assessment, as is clear she did from �9  of  the
    decision, and how it demonstrates a disproportionate interference  with
    family life.

13. The grounds assert that the judge placed  significant  reliance  on  or
    given weight to immaterial matters. There are  a  number  of  allegedly
    unwarranted and unjustified assertions and assumptions in the decision,
    unsupported by evidence or cogent reasoning. For example,  at  �13  the
    judge finds it reasonable to assume that the  claimant  has  a  genuine
    fear of being found to be a daughter of her mother,  and  that  she  is
    from an Ahmadi family. The First-tier  Tribunal  decision  purports  to
    rely on judicial knowledge but does not justify the finding that family
    members of Ahmadis are per se subject to persecution. The claimant  did
    not assert that she was in fear or at risk, or if she  did  it  is  not
    recorded in the decision. Her statement at  A11  expresses  the  belief
    that she would be killed or kidnapped, and that she was  vulnerable,  a
    theme reflected in the witness statement  of  the  parents.  Mr  Jarvis
    submitted that it borders on speculation for the judge to 'assume' that
    the claimant has a genuine  fear,  especially  since  fear  must  be  a
    subjective experience. On the whole, however, I  am  satisfied  it  was
    reasonable for the judge to equate the evidence to a fear on  the  part
    of the claimant.

14. Similarly, at �17 it is  asserted  that  the  judge  makes  assumptions
    unsupported by evidence and for which cogent reasoning is  said  to  be
    absent. The judge assumes that as the eldest child of her  parents  and
    the only daughter amongst three siblings,  the  claimant  must  have  a
    particular bond with her mother. As the grounds assert, the judge  "may
    have  imported   personal   and   cultural   expectations   of   family
    relationships into the appellant's personal circumstances."  Whilst  it
    is of marginal importance in the overall assessment, I  do  agree  that
    the judge appears to have preferred her personal opinion over  specific
    evidence.

15. At �18 of the decision the judge cited Kugathas and the well-know dicta
    that without evidence of further elements of dependency involving  more
    than the normal emotional  ties,  relationships  between  adult  family
    members is not within family life protected by Article 8 ECHR. But  the
    judge went on to say, without evidential foundation, that the  claimant
    has ties with minor brothers "who will wish to be re-united with  their
    sister," and at �20 "This appellant ought to be with  her  parents  and
    her siblings who are also deprived of their right to family life by her
    continued exclusion from the UK." These comments and discussion  assume
    that the claimant continues to have family life with  her  parents  and
    siblings, but does identify what evidence demonstrates  more  than  the
    normal emotional times and does not take any adequate  account  of  the
    fact that the claimant has been living  apart  from  the  family  since
    before they left for the UK. The evidence was  that  she  had  been  at
    college studying for a degree since 2011 and  resided  term-time  since
    the commencement of those studies in a student hostel and went  to  her
    aunt's  during  holidays.  The  witness  statements  do  not  help   me
    distinguish the period of time up to the date of decision and from when
    the claimant was living away from home. In  examining  the  handwritten
    record of proceedings I can see that her father claimed  that  she  had
    lived with him during the year before he and his son came to the UK  in
    2013. However, on cross-examination it  was  made  clear  that  it  was
    during one school holiday when the hostel was closed and  the  claimant
    did not want to go to her aunt's, as she usually did, some 45Km away. I
    do not accept the submission made by Mr Lee  at  the  outset  that  the
    judge's finding at �19 that she had never lived apart from her  parents
    until her mother had to flee Pakistan can be justified on the  evidence
    as being accurate or open to the judge to make. It is  clear  that  she
    left home to study at college and apparently  did  not  return  to  the
    family home until after her mother had left Pakistan and the length  of
    her stay with her father on that one occasion is not entirely clear.

16. This does not necessarily mean that there can be no extant family  life
    between the claimant and her family members in the UK; each case should
    be analysed on its own facts, to decide  whether  or  not  family  life
    exists, within the meaning of Article 8(1). It has been recognised that
    family life may continue between parent and child even after the  child
    has attained his majority: see Etti-Adegbola v Secretary of  State  for
    the Home Department  [2009]  EWCA  Civ  1319.  However,  it  should  be
    remembered that there is no presumption that  a  person  has  a  family
    life, even with the members of a person's immediate family.  The  court
    has to scrutinise the relevant factors, including identifying  who  are
    the near relatives of the claimant, the nature  of  the  links  between
    them and the appellant, the age of the appellant, where and  with  whom
    he has resided in the past, and the forms of contact he has  maintained
    with the other members of the family with whom  he  claims  to  have  a
    family life. It appears to me that the judge has made a presumption  of
    family life without identifying those  factors  which  justify  such  a
    conclusion. I find that the judge has failed to identify  or  reference
    the evidence and provide rational reasons for  concluding  that  family
    life continued sufficient to engage the protection of Article  8  in  a
    person who was an adult before the date of application in 2013.

17. There appears to be no valid reason for the judge to recite section  E-
    ILRDR in the decision.

18. I also note that whilst the judge set out section 117B, she  failed  in
    the proportionality balancing exercise between  on  the  one  hand  the
    rights of the claimant and her family members  and  on  the  other  the
    legitimate and necessary public interest  in  protecting  the  economic
    well-being of the UK through immigration control, to take into  account
    that immigration control is in the public interest and that it  appears
    that  the  claimant  neither  speaks   English   nor   is   financially
    independent, both of which considerations are specifically directed  at
    those who seek to enter (or remain in) the UK. The  decision  fails  to
    factor in any direct reference to section 117B other than to set it out
    in full before embarking on the reasons for the decision. The  Tribunal
    is required to have regard to these public interest  considerations  in
    the proportionality balancing exercise.

19. In the circumstances, taken as a whole,  I  find  that  the  Article  8
    assessment, sympathetic as it is to the claimant's circumstances, comes
    dangerously close to the  supplanting  of  a  fact-based  and  reasoned
    analysis with a subjective assessment. It may be that there lies within
    parts of the oral or documentary evidence  facts  which  supported  the
    conclusions drawn, but it is  difficult  to  determine  that  from  the
    decision itself. It is not necessary for the judge to set out or recite
    all the evidence relied on, but it must be clear on what factual  basis
    the judge has reached the conclusions drawn. As a  whole,  I  find  the
    Article 8 assessment cannot withstand scrutiny and is flawed so that it
    amounts to an error of law requiring the decision to be set  aside  and
    remade.

20. When a decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside,  section
    12(2) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 requires either
    that the case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  with  directions,
    or it must be remade by the Upper Tribunal. The scheme of the Tribunals
    Court and Enforcement Act 2007 does not assign the function of  primary
    fact finding to the Upper Tribunal. Where the findings are  unsupported
    and inadequately justified on crucial issues at the heart of an appeal,
    as they are in this case,  effectively  there  has  not  been  a  valid
    determination of those issues. The errors of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    vitiates the findings of fact and the conclusions from those facts,  so
    that there has not been a valid determination  of  the  issues  in  the
    appeal.

21. In all the circumstances, I relist this appeal for a fresh  hearing  in
    the First-tier Tribunal, on the basis that this is a case  which  falls
    squarely within the Senior President's Practice Statement at  paragraph
    7.2. The effect of the error has been to deprive the Secretary of State
    of a fair hearing and that the nature or extent of  any  judicial  fact
    finding which is necessary for the decision in the appeal to be re-made
    is such that, having regard to the overriding objective in  rule  2  to
    deal with cases fairly and justly,  including  with  the  avoidance  of
    delay, I find that it is appropriate to remit this appeal to the First-
    tier Tribunal to determine the appeal afresh.

Conclusion & Decision:

22. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

     I remit the decision to the First-tier Tribunal to be remade afresh.

Consequential Directions

23. The appeal is to be reheard in the First-tier Tribunal for  a  de  novo
    hearing with no findings preserved;

24. The appeal should be listed at Hatton Cross, with a time estimate of  2
    hours;

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I no fee award.

Reasons: The outcome of the appeal remains to be decided.
