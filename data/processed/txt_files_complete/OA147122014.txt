                       (ANONYMITY DIRECTION not made)
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr S Staunton, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

For the Respondent:    Mr M Atif, Sponsor


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Respondent (now referred to  as  the  Claimant)  is  a  citizen  of
    Pakistan who applied for entry clearance to the  United  Kingdom  as  a
    partner of a person present and settled here under Appendix FM  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  The application was refused because  the  Secretary
    of State was not satisfied that the Claimant met  the  requirements  of
    the Rules under Appendix FM and in particular  the  related  evidential
    requirements under Appendix FM-SE.   The  Claimant  appealed  and  that
    appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Sangha who concluded that
    the Claimant did meet the requirements of Appendix FM and  allowed  the
    appeal under the Immigration Rules.

 2. The Secretary of State lodged grounds of appeal pointing out that  only
    wages paid into a bank account and appearing on the statements  may  be
    counted towards the Sponsor's  gross  income  in  accordance  with  the
    evidence of financial requirements at paragraph 1(n) of Appendix  FM-SE
    which is in the following terms:

         "(n) The gross amount of any cash income may be counted  where  the
             person's specified bank statements show the net  amount  which
             relates to the gross amount shown on their pay  slips  (or  in
             the relevant specified evidence provided in  addition  to  the
             specified  bank  statements  in  relation  to   non-employment
             income).  Otherwise only the net amount shown on the specified
             bank statements may be counted."

 3. The grounds go on to say that it was not open to the judge to draw  his
    own conclusions based on  the  credibility  of  the  Sponsor  or  other
    documents in the absence of those specified.  As such it was  submitted
    that the judge had erred in law.

 4. Permission to appeal was duly granted. The Claimant  did  not  lodge  a
    Rule 24 notice. Thus the matter came before me on the above date.

 5. Given that the Sponsor was not legally represented I  did  my  best  to
    explain the procedure to him.  For the Secretary of State it  was  said
    that the issue was a fundamental if narrow  one.   The  income  of  the
    Sponsor was well over the ï¿½18,600 required but the income from  Flaming
    House was not paid into the bank account and if  that  income  was  not
    taken into account the threshold was not met.  As such  the  judge  had
    committed a material error in law by allowing the appeal  as  he  could
    not simply ignore the Immigration  Rules.   I  was  asked  to  set  the
    decision aside and remake the decision.

 6. For the Appellant Mr Atif started to explain the background to the case
    and errors that had been made  by  the  Secretary  of  State.   He  had
    nothing to say on the point taken by Mr Staunton for the  Secretary  of
    State.  I inferred that he was submitting that  Judge  Sangha  had  not
    made a material error in law.

 7. I reserved my decision.

 Conclusions

 8. It has to be said that  the  requirements  of  Appendix  FM-SE  can  be
    extremely  precise  and  exacting.   The  particular  provision   which
    requires attention is as set  out  above.   No  doubt  there  are  good
    reasons why the requirements are in the terms they are.   That  is  not
    the issue before me.  Cash income can be counted but must be  disclosed
    in the bank statements.  That did not happen in this case.  The Sponsor
    does not present any contrary arguments.  The judge  glossed  over  the
    strict requirements of the Rules  primarily  because  the  Home  Office
    Presenting Officer said that there were other documents in  support  of
    the evidence given by the Sponsor with regard to his earnings from  the
    second employment.  Unfortunately for the Claimant,  having  regard  to
    the specific terms of the Rules, that is simply not good  enough.   The
    Rules must be complied with.  It  was  not  argued  on  behalf  of  the
    Sponsor in this case that they were complied with  and  indeed  on  the
    facts presented before the First-tier Judge that was not the submission
    that could be made.  Because the judge found that the Immigration Rules
    were satisfied when they were clearly not so satisfied allows for  only
    one possible conclusion - the judge made a material error  in  law  and
    his decision must be  set  aside  and  the  decision  reversed.   I  am
    therefore doing that and substituting a fresh decision  dismissing  the
    appeal.

 9. I should say that after conclusion of the case and after  dictation  of
    this decision I received submissions in the form of 10 pages from Salma
    Khan the lawyer for the  Claimant  Mrs  Babu.  It  appears  that  these
    submissions were sent to Field House on the day of the hearing at 17.46
    and arrived the day after the hearing. They  are  therefore  very  late
    indeed and while I must have regard to fairness to the Claimant I  must
    also have regard to fairness to the  Secretary  of  State  and  to  the
    importance of compliance with the procedural rules. I  have  regard  to
    the overriding objective and parties' obligation to cooperate with  the
    Upper tribunal as set out in paragraph  2  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008. In these circumstances and for the sake of
    clarity  I  should  say  that  I  have  not  considered  these  further
    submissions. The remedy for Mrs Babu is to lodge a  fresh  application.
    There is no need for an anonymity order.

Notice of Decision

10. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

11. I set aside the decision.

12. I remake the decision in the appeal by dismissing it.



No anonymity direction is made.
