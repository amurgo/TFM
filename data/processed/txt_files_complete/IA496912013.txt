Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr M Iqbal of Counsel instructed by ABS Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. At the time of  the  hearing  before  me  in  the  Upper  Tribunal  the
    appellant was represented by  Counsel,  Mr  Iqbal,  instructed  by  ABS
    Solicitors.  I should point out that, subsequently, the  appellant  has
    appointed new representatives, Rainbow  Solicitors.   The  letter  from
    Rainbow Solicitors dated 30th December 2014 requests that  my  decision
    should be sent to them and not previous representatives.

 2. On 29th September 2014 Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Lever  gave
    permission to the appellant to appeal against the decision of Judge  of
    the First-tier Tribunal Scobbie who dismissed the  appeal  against  the
    decision of the respondent taken on 5th November 2013 to  refuse  leave
    to remain for the appellant as a Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) Migrant under
    the points-based system.

 3. The grounds of application contended that the judge erred  because  his
    decision was based on "complete speculation" as to  what  the  relevant
    Rule in force on 5th April 2012 was.  It was argued that the respondent
    should have produced a copy  of  the  relevant  Rules  and  any  policy
    guidance for the judge to study.  Judge Lever thought it arguable  that
    the judge had to be satisfied as to the exact requirements in the Rules
    as a matter of fairness bearing  in  mind  the  lengthy  delay  in  the
    respondent reaching a conclusion on the appellant's application.

 4. At the hearing before me Mr Iqbal  submitted  additional  grounds.   He
    argued that, as the respondent had entered a response under Rule 24  on
    14th October 2014 (which  asserted  that  the  judge  had  not  made  a
    material error) he was able to vary the  grounds.   Mr  Tufan  did  not
    object to the fresh  arguments  put  forward  by  Mr  Iqbal  and  so  I
    proceeded on the basis that I could consider them having in  mind  that
    they might be regarded as Robinson obvious albeit that, for the reasons
    which I set out, below, I do not accept that they can  lead  to  a  re-
    hearing of this appeal.

Submissions

 5. Mr Iqbal acknowledged that, if the matter  were  as  simple  as  giving
    consideration to the financial information provided by the appellant at
    the date of his application on 5th April 2012, then the judge's failure
    to have the relevant Rules before him when  hearing  and  deciding  the
    appeal might not be material.  That was because the judge evidently had
    in mind the correct version of the Rules in force by reference  to  the
    terms of the respondent's refusal which summarised them.   However,  he
    submitted that the sequence of events leading up to the hearing  before
    Judge Scobbie on 5th August 2014 should have led the judge to  conclude
    that the appellant had varied his original leave application before the
    respondent had made a substantive decision  upon  it  on  5th  November
    2013.

 6. In order to understand Mr Iqbal's argument it is necessary  for  me  to
    set out the relevant background.  The  appellant  came  to  the  United
    Kingdom with a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant visa on  27th  February
    2009.  That was valid until 31st  January  2011  and  was  subsequently
    extended to 28th June 2012.  He then made the Tier 1 (Post-Study  Work)
    Migrant application on 5th April 2012 which forms the subject  of  this
    appeal.  That application was initially refused by  the  respondent  on
    1st October 2012.  The appellant appealed that decision and  a  hearing
    was due on 13th December 2012.  However, the  respondent  withdrew  the
    refusal decision on 10th December 2012 "having  reviewed  the  evidence
    available  ...".   At  that  time  the  appellant   had   a   different
    representative, LaWise.  In February and March 2013 LaWise wrote to the
    respondent requesting to know when the appellant would  receive  a  new
    visa as a post-study work migrant.  It appears that, in May  2013,  the
    appellant received an email from the respondent declaring him to be  an
    overstayer so LaWise wrote  to  the  respondent  again  and  threatened
    judicial review.  Eventually, the refusal decision of 5th December 2013
    was sent.  In essence this has the same  reasons  for  refusal  as  the
    earlier letter namely that the appellant had provided  bank  statements
    which did not cover the full 90 day period required by the  Rules  from
    6th January 2012 to 4th April  2012.   It  was  pointed  out  that  the
    statements submitted with the application did not cover the period from
    6th January to 9th January 2012 and, in any event, on 9th January 2012,
    the level of available funds fell below �800.

 7. In summary, Mr Iqbal's argument is  that,  in  the  appellant's  bundle
    submitted for the hearing which was due to take place on 13th  December
    2012, the appellant had submitted not only his original bank statements
    from 9th January 2012 but also statements of his mother's account  with
    ICICI Bank covering the period from 1st November  2011  to  30th  April
    2012 containing funds which his mother had confirmed could be available
    to her son during the relevant period.  As this bundle had been  served
    on the respondent, it should have been taken as an application to  vary
    the application (which was outstanding because of the  withdrawal)  and
    thus to show  that  the  appellant  could  comply  with  the  financial
    requirements of the Rule in force on 5th April  2012.   In  support  of
    this argument Mr Iqbal relies  upon  the  Upper  Tribunal  decision  in
    Qureshi (Tier 4 - effect of variation - App  C)  Pakistan  [2011]  UKUT
    00412 (IAC).  In that case the appellant had varied her application  by
    sending to the respondent a new CAS and a fresh  bank  statement  which
    was accepted by the Upper Tribunal as variation of the application  and
    enabled them to allow the appeal.  Mr Iqbal also relies upon the  Court
    of Appeal decision in Ali [2013] EWCA Civ 1198 as further  support  for
    the argument that Section 85A of the 2002 Act  does  not  preclude  the
    Tribunal from taking into account post-application  evidence  (in  that
    case an award of degree) if adduced before the decision was made.

 8. Mr Iqbal contends, in the light of the above,  that,  as  the  original
    refusal was withdrawn, the appellant's application remained outstanding
    and so the  respondent  should  have  regarded  it  as  varied  by  the
    additional information provided in support of the appeal which did  not
    proceed.

 9. Mr Iqbal's arguments are now set out in a skeleton argument  which  was
    sent to the Upper Tribunal on 18th  November  2014.   A  copy  of  this
    skeleton argument was not, so far as I am aware, sent to the respondent
    although it repeats those arguments put before me at  the  hearing  and
    which were responded to by Mr Tufan as follows.

10. Mr Tufan (who coincidentally was the  Presenting  Officer  in  Qureshi)
    thought  that  the  Upper  Tribunal  decision  in  Qureshi   could   be
    distinguished from the present case  as  it  related  to  a  change  of
    college whereas, in this case, the application was simply being revised
    by fresh financial information.  He emphasised that it was the date  of
    application which  was  relevant  and  thus  the  appellant  could  not
    succeed.  He also submitted that, although Judge Scobbie did not have a
    copy of the relevant Rule in front of him, the right decision had  been
    reached as the appellant had not shown that he had the relevant  amount
    of �800 for a continuous 90 day period.  This was  the  requirement  of
    the Rule in force at the time of the application which was made one day
    before the Tier 1 scheme was withdrawn.

11. Mr Iqbal concluded his submissions by requesting that the matter should
    go forward to a re-hearing before the First-tier Tribunal on the issues
    he had raised.

Conclusions

12. If it were not for the argument put forward by Mr Iqbal at the  hearing
    I would have had little hesitation in concluding that the  decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge does not show a material error on a point
    of law.  That is because, although the judge did not have the full text
    of the relevant Rule when he came to hear and to decide the appeal, his
    application of the restrictions on evidence to be produced set  out  in
    Section 85A of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  was,
    nevertheless, correct and meant that the appellant had not  shown  that
    he had the required funds for the relevant period on the basis set  out
    in the refusal letter of 5th November 2013.

13. Mr Iqbal's arguments appear attractive because the original refusal  of
    the appellant's application was withdrawn by the respondent just before
    the appeal hearing was due to take place at which the appellant was  to
    submit information to fill the gaps in the 90 day period not covered by
    the appellant's own  bank  statements  and  to  provide  proof  of  the
    additional funds needed to make up any deficiency in the �800  required
    throughout that period.  A copy of the  original  bundle  submitted  is
    included in the bundle used at the hearing  before  Judge  Scobbie  and
    contains a letter of support from  the  appellant's  mother  with  bank
    statements covering the period from 1st November  2011  to  30th  April
    2012.  No conversion of the amounts in the account  has  been  provided
    however.  Mr Iqbal asks  that  the  submission  of  the  mother's  bank
    account as evidence  of  third  party  support  should  be  seen  as  a
    variation to the appellant's application.

14. I do not agree with Mr Iqbal's contention.  The submission of  evidence
    for a hearing is one thing but the variation of  a  formal  application
    cannot, I conclude, be inferred from the production of those documents.
     It is certainly arguable that if those additional bank  documents  had
    been put before the Tribunal on the basis of the  first  refusal,  they
    would not have  been  admissible  as  they  were  submitted  after  the
    application.  When the appellant was notified  of  the  withdrawal  his
    application again became open before the  respondent  and  so,  on  the
    basis set  out  in  Qureshi,  the  respondent  might  have  accepted  a
    variation although that is by no  means  certain  particularly  bearing
    mind that the circumstances in Qureshi are significantly  different  to
    those in this appeal. In that case the appellant varied an  application
    to extend leave as a student on the basis of a change  of  college.  In
    this appeal it is said  that  the  provision  of  additional  financial
    information can be regarded as a variation. But the application  itself
    remains the same, it is only the supporting evidence which is  changed.
    That is not, I conclude, a "variation".

15. It is also my conclusion that, if the appellant wanted to make a formal
    request for variation of his application he should have written to  the
    respondent with the additional information and made  a  formal  request
    that his application be varied to take account of the  funds  available
    to him through his mother.  It has to be borne in  mind  that,  as  the
    respondent had withdrawn the original decision, she had  no  reason  to
    consider the documents submitted for the appeal which, consequent  upon
    the withdrawal,  was  not  to  proceed.   Only  a  subsequent,  formal,
    application  to  vary  would  have  put  the  matter  before  her   for
    consideration.  This did not happen and, in any event, I  have  already
    indicated that the supply of additional evidence does not amount  to  a
    variation of the application.

16. Additionally, for the reasons already given, it cannot be said that the
    respondent acted with any unfairness.  Thus,  my  conclusion  is  that,
    although the Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  consider  any
    variation argument nor did the judge have a copy of the  relevant  Rule
    before him, there is no material error in the decision to  dismiss  the
    appeal.  There could have been no other result for the reasons  I  have
    given and so the decision shall stand.



Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not show an error  on  a  point
of law and shall stand.

Anonymity

Anonymity was not requested before the Upper Tribunal nor do I  consider  it
appropriate.
