For the Appellant:     In person
For the Respondent:    Ms A Holmes, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant, a citizen  of  Bangladesh  born  on  12  September  1982
    appeals, with permission, against a decision of Judge of the First-tier
    Tribunal Herlihy who in a determination promulgated on  25  April  2014
    dismissed the appellant's appeal against a decision of the Secretary of
    State made on 8 October 2013 to refuse to vary his leave to remain as a
    Tier 1 Entrepreneur and to seek his removal from the United Kingdom.

2.     The application had been refused under paragraph 322(1A)  of  HC  395
    because two documents dated 28 May 2013 issued by  the  Brac  Bank,  on
    which the appellant wished to rely and which purported to show  that  a
    Mr Moazzam Hussain Khan who held the sum  of  �238,014  with  the  bank
    intended to invest �200,000 for the appellant's business had been found
    not to be genuine.  The letters, from the Tongi  branch of the bank had
    claimed that  the sums available were held in the Gulshan branch of the
    Brac Bank in two accounts being account  numbers  1501301954802005  and
    1501301954802004 been issued by the bank.

3.   When these certificates were sent to the Brac Bank  the  had  confirmed
    that they had not been issued from the Tongi branch.

4.   At the hearing before Judge Herlihy the  appellant  asserted  that  the
    document verification report was wrong  and  that  the  documents  were
    genuine.  The appellant had explained that his sponsor was initially to
    be his uncle.  He had changed sponsor to get a new sponsor  who  was  a
    friend of his father.  The appellant said that he discussed the refusal
    letter with  the  sponsor  and  with  his  father  and  that  they  had
    quarrelled.  He has stated that he hoped the sponsor would sponsor  him
    again.  The appellant was asked why  the  sponsor  did  not  provide  a
    letter from the bank to confirm the statement had been  issued  by  the
    Tongi branch and that it was the correct account.  The  appellant  said
    that he had not asked the sponsor to  obtain  such  a  letter  but  the
    sponsor would be able to provide it.  He  confirmed  that  he  had  not
    obtained any evidence from the bank but said  that  he  had  spoken  to
    someone from the bank who had confirmed that everything was OK and that
    the sponsor had a fixed deposit account.

5.   The judge noted the terms of the determination of the  Tribunal  in  RP
    (Proof of Forgery) [2006] UKAIT 00086 and JC (Part 9 HC 395 - Burden of
    Proof) China [2007] UKAIT 00027 and the Court of Appeal judgment in  AA
    (Nigeria) [2010] EWCA Civ 773.  She noted that the burden of proof  lay
    on the  respondent  to  prove  that  the  documents  were  false.   She
    concluded that the respondent  had  discharged  the  burden  of  proof.
    Having considered the issue of the appellant's rights under  Article  8
    of the ECHR in the light of the Supreme Court decision in Patel  [2013]
    UKSC 27 the judge found that the appeal should  be  dismissed  on  both
    immigration and human rights grounds.

6.   The appellant appealed.  Permission to  appeal  was  granted  by  Judge
    Osborne on 11 June  2014.   In  granting  permission  to  appeal  Judge
    Osborne stated that it was arguable that the evidence relied on by  the
    respondent   amounted  any  more  than  a  prima  facie  case  in   the
    respondent's favour and it was  incumbent  upon  her  to  make  further
    enquiries in order to establish the position to the necessary standard.

7.   At the hearing of the appeal before me  the  appellant  protested  that
    the bank had been prejudiced against him, that  the  judge  should  not
    have taken into account the terms of the  letter  from  the  Brac  Bank
    which stated that "the attached certificates and  statements  have  NOT
    BEEN ISSUED from Tongi branch" and indicated that he might now be  able
    to produce further evidence to show that the account was  genuine.   He
    confirmed that he had told Judge Herlihy that  he  had  not  asked  the
    sponsor to produce any further evidence  when  he  had  given  evidence
    before her.

8.   Ms Holmes stated that the judge  had  reached  conclusions  which  were
    fully open to her on the evidence.

9.   I find there is no material error of law in the  determination  of  the
    judge who correctly set out the burden of proof in a case where forgery
    is alleged.  She had considered the evidence both of the appellant  and
    that on which the Secretary of State  relied  and  reached  conclusions
    which were open to her - she was entitled to  find  having  taken  into
    account the letter from the bank that the accounts were not genuine.

10.  I therefore find that  there  is  no  material  error  of  law  in  the
    determination of the Immigration Judge and I  dismiss  this  appeal  on
    both immigration and human rights grounds.
