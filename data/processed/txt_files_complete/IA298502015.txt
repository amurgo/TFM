Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr E Tufan, a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the respondent:    No appearance or representation


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. The Secretary of State appeals with permission against  the  decision  of
   the First-tier Tribunal  to  allow  the  claimant's  appeal  against  her
   decision to refuse to exercise  discretion  and  grant  the  claimant  an
   extended family member residence permit,  as  the  dependant  of  an  EEA
   citizen,  his  aunt,  who  is  a  citizen  of  the  Netherlands,   albeit
   incorrectly described in the First-tier Tribunal  decision  as  a  Polish
   citizen.

2. Applying the decision of the Upper  Tribunal  in  Sala  (EFMs:  Right  of
   Appeal: Albania) [2016] UKUT 411 (IAC):

         There is no statutory right of appeal against the decision  of  the
         Secretary of State not to  grant  a  Residence  Card  to  a  person
         claiming to be an Extended Family Member.

3. The appellant therefore has no right of appeal.



DECISION

The First-tier Tribunal had no jurisdiction to hear the appeal. It erred  in
law in doing so.

I set aside the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  substitute  a
decision that there is no valid appeal.
