Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is the remaking of the decision in the  appeal  of  the  Appellant
    following my error of law decision promulgated on 5 July 2018 in  which
    I concluded that the First-tier Tribunal had made  material  errors  of
    law and that its decision had to be set aside.  I  then  adjourned  the
    appeal with directions (error of law decision annexed, below).

 2. In essence I concluded that the First-tier Tribunal judge had failed to
    deal adequately with the effect of her conclusion that the  Appellant's
    partner could not be expected to go and live with  him  permanently  in
    Pakistan, and that she had also  failed  to  address  the  question  of
    whether the Appellant should return alone and make an  entry  clearance
    application (the Chikwamba point).  I made it clear that there  was  no
    longer  any  dispute  about  the   genuineness   of   the   Appellant's
    relationship with his partner nor whether the latter  could  indeed  be
    expected to go and live in Pakistan.

The evidence now before me

 3. In addition to the Respondent's bundle and the Appellant's bundle  that
    was before the First-tier Tribunal, I now have a new  bundle  from  the
    Appellant's  representatives,  indexed   and   paginated   1-46,   with
    additional documents attached  thereafter.   I  admitted  new  evidence
    under Rule  15(2A)  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  Procedure  Rules  without
    objection from Ms Kenny.  The Appellant and his partner  both  attended
    the hearing and gave oral evidence, a full note of which  is  contained
    in the Record of Proceedings.

  Submissions

For the Respondent

 4. Ms Kenny accepted that the oral evidence had  been  fairly  consistent.
    She also accepted that the Appellant had had at least some  involvement
    with his partner's two children.  However she submitted that  this  was
    not strong enough for him to succeed in his appeal.  She noted that  he
    did not live with the children, although acknowledged that this  was  a
    matter beyond his control.  He had no  involvement  with  their  school
    lives  and  she  noted  the  lack  of  evidence   from   the   relevant
    institutions.  Ms Kenny submitted that  if  the  Appellant  left  there
    would be no practical consequences for the children as they  live  with
    their grandmother.  She submitted that even permanent  separation  from
    them would not be disproportionate.  The partner's son,  who  Ms  Kenny
    accepted suffers from a number of additional  challenges,  was  getting
    help from professionals.  In respect of the partner, Ms Kenny  accepted
    that she suffers from medical conditions but submitted that  she  could
    obtain help from her own mother.  It was submitted that  the  Appellant
    could and  should  return  to  Pakistan  to  make  an  entry  clearance
    application.

For the Appellant

 5. Ms Elliott-Kelly relied on her detailed skeleton argument.  In  essence
    she submitted that the conclusion of the First-tier Tribunal judge that
    it would be harsh for the partner to go  and  live  in  Pakistan  on  a
    permanent basis, and my unchallenged interpretation of this that it had
    the effect of showing "insurmountable obstacles" in her doing so, was a
    very significant factor in this case.  It showed that, at  least  on  a
    hypothetical basis, the Appellant could satisfy EX.1(b) of Appendix  FM
    to the Immigration Rules.  This was relevant because it meant that  his
    lack of  status  and  his  inability  to  satisfy  the  minimum  income
    threshold (an accepted fact) were,  in  essence,  rendered  of  neutral
    effect.  It also meant that the Respondent  was  essentially  accepting
    that a permanent separation of the Appellant from his partner would  be
    disproportionate. Therefore, the only way in which the Respondent could
    possibly justify the decision under appeal in the context of Article  8
    was if the Appellant should be expected to return to Pakistan alone and
    make an entry clearance application.  Ms Elliott-Kelly referred  me  to
    the Court of Appeal judgment in Tikka [2018] EWCA Civ 642, at paragraph
    20.  She noted that if the Appellant tried to make an  entry  clearance
    application from Pakistan it would be bound to  fail:  firstly  because
    the minimum income threshold could not be met;  secondly,  and  in  her
    submission importantly, EX.1 of Appendix FM does  not  apply  to  entry
    clearance  applications.   This  would  have  the  consequence  of  the
    Appellant being effectively permanently  separated  from  his  partner.
    This would allow the Appellant to succeed in his appeal.

 6. As regards the two children's circumstances and the  partner's  health,
    Ms Elliott-Kelly submitted  that  these  issues  simply  added  further
    strength to the Appellant's case although she did not have to  rely  on
    these circumstances in order for him to succeed.  It was submitted that
    even  a  temporary  separation,  were  the  Appellant  to  seek   entry
    clearance, could not be justified in light of what  were  described  as
    "compelling"  factors.   It  was  in  the  children's  best  interests,
    particularly those of the partner's son, for the  Appellant  to  remain
    part of their lives.  Neither child had been told  of  the  Appellant's
    immigration circumstances and any separation at all would cause serious
    distress.  The partner's son's conditions would exacerbate  this.   The
    partner herself suffered from a number of health issues and had  had  a
    number of flare ups in recent times.  She  could  not  reasonably  seek
    assistance from her mother who was already looking after  the  children
    by virtue of court orders.  These orders  prevented  the  partner  from
    living with her children,  and  therefore  her  mother  as  well.   The
    inability to meet the minimum income requirement would have been  fatal
    to an entry clearance application but not to an in-country  application
    on the basis that EX.1 was satisfied.  The unlawful  residence  of  the
    Appellant was not in and of itself sufficient to refuse  an  in-country
    application either because, once again, of the effect of EX.1.   I  was
    referred to paragraph 51 of Agyarko [2017] UKSC 11.   Ms  Elliott-Kelly
    submitted that there was no sensible reason for the Appellant to return
    to Pakistan to make an entry clearance application.

 7. At the end of the hearing I reserved my decision.

Relevant findings of fact

 8. There is no longer any dispute about  the  nature  of  the  Appellant's
    relationship with his partner.  I find that they are, and have been for
    a number of years, in a genuine and subsisting  relationship  and  that
    they began cohabiting relatively soon after the relationship  began  in
    November 2014.  I find that the partner has two children both  of  whom
    reside with their maternal grandmother  by  virtue  of  orders  of  the
    family court.  I do not have the precise details of  these  orders  but
    suffice it to say that they require  the  children  to  live  with  the
    grandmother and prevent the partner from  having  unsupervised  contact
    with the children or to live with them under the  same  roof.   I  find
    that the partner's son is eleven years old  and  has  recently  started
    secondary school.  I find that he  has  a  diagnosis  of  ADHD  and  is
    awaiting assessment for  possible  autism  as  well.   I  find  that  a
    psychologist has also raised issues of particular attachment issues.  I
    accept the partner's oral evidence that  her  son  had  an  Educational
    Health Care plan whilst at primary school.

 9. I turn to the evidence relating to the  Appellant's  relationship  with
    the children.  On a general note I found the evidence of the  Appellant
    and his partner to be highly consistent, both in its written  and  oral
    form.  Both were quite  properly  tested  in  cross-examination  by  Ms
    Kenny.  There were very  few,  if  any,  discrepancies.   None  of  the
    evidence was in any way inherently improbable.  Applying the balance of
    probabilities I find both to have given credible evidence to me.

10. I find that the Appellant does indeed have a significant involvement in
    the children's lives and has done since  approximately  2015.   I  find
    that he sees them both every weekend.  He quite candidly accepted  that
    he did not have particular involvement in their school lives, but in my
    view nothing turns on this.  He does not  see  them  during  the  week,
    something which I find to be entirely plausible, and the weekends,  the
    time when  he  does  see  them,  are  spent  in  pursuance  of  leisure
    activities rather than schoolwork, again something that I  find  to  be
    plausible.   I  find  that  whilst  the  Appellant  does  have  a  good
    relationship  with  the  partner's  daughter,  as  she  sees  her   own
    biological father on a regular  basis,  their  bond  is  somewhat  more
    limited, as perhaps indicated by the fact that she  calls  him  by  his
    first name rather than, for example "dad".   However,  this  stands  in
    sharp contrast to the Appellant's relationship with his partner's  son.
    It is quite clear to me  that  there  is  a  particularly  strong  bond
    between the two, with the son now referring to  the  Appellant  as  his
    "dad".  In many cases a strong relationship may  still  carry  only  so
    much weight. In this case the son's condition (ADHD) and  likely  other
    challenges, in conjunction with the complete absence of his  biological
    father from his life, and the fact that he is  only  just  starting  in
    secondary school (a considerable step for any child) lead  me  to  find
    that the son places very significant reliance on his relationship  with
    the Appellant.  I find that the son does indeed see the Appellant as  a
    father figure, indeed the only father figure that he has ever known.

11. It is extremely likely in my view that the son  would  experience  very
    great distress leading to considerable detriment to his  emotional  and
    quite possibly his educational wellbeing were the Appellant  to  leave.
    This is all compounded by the fact, as  I  find  it  to  be,  that  the
    Appellant's very precarious situation in  this  country  has  not  been
    raised with the children.  I fully understand the reasons  behind  this
    (particularly relating to the son) and the departure of the  Appellant,
    even on a temporary basis, would come as a real shock thus exacerbating
    what would already and in any event be a very difficult scenario.

12. In respect of  the  partner's  mother,  I  find  that  she  is  in  all
    likelihood unable, even  if  willing,  to  offer  meaningful  practical
    support to her daughter.  She is  already  taking  care  of  two  young
    children, one of whom clearly faces significant challenges in his life.
     Beyond this, it is impossible for the partner to stay at her  mother's
    home (because the children are there) or for the mother  to  stay  with
    the partner (because the children would need  to  come  with  her).   I
    accept the partner's evidence that she has no other family  members  or
    indeed friends who would be able to step in and assist her.

13. This leads on to my findings on the partner's own health.  There  is  a
    good deal of medical evidence before me.  I find it all to be reliable.
     It is clear  that  the  partner  suffers  from  a  number  of  medical
    conditions not least of which is a liver  condition.   There  are  also
    issues relating to cysts on her  ovaries,  leg  pain,  and  generalised
    pain.  On the evidence before me I find that the "flare ups"  described
    by the partner in her oral evidence have in fact  occurred  to  such  a
    serious extent in the last three or  four  months  that  she  has  been
    admitted into hospital on three occasions.  I accept that during  these
    episodes she is very seriously disabled in terms of  functionality  and
    her ability to undertake certain aspects of personal care  and  general
    day-to-day activities around the house.  I accept her evidence that  it
    is the Appellant, and the Appellant alone, who assists her  with  these
    issues, particularly during the more difficult episodes.

Conclusions

14. The Appellant is, strictly speaking, still unable to satisfy the  Rules
    because he had not been cohabiting with his partner for  at  least  two
    years prior to the making of the human rights claim on 11 May 2016.  On
    that basis alone the Appellant has been and is unable to rely  on  EX.1
    in light of the case of Sabir (Appendix FM - EX.1  not  free  standing)
    [2014] UKUT 00063 (IAC). The Appellant's case  therefore  falls  to  be
    considered on Article 8 grounds outside the context of the Rules.

15. The essential test is whether the Respondent's decision strikes a  fair
    balance between the Appellant's rights on the one hand and  the  public
    interest on the other.  In respect of  the  latter  the  Rules  are  of
    considerable significance as they represent the  Respondent's  view  of
    where that balance lies.

16. There is in this case clearly family life as between the Appellant  and
    his partner.  It is also clear to me  that  there  is  family  life  as
    between the Appellant and the  partner's  two  children  especially  in
    relation to her son, on the facts that I have found them  to  be.   The
    absence of cohabitation with the children is, in the  circumstances  of
    this case, really beside the point.

17. The Respondent's decision was clearly an interference  of  sufficiently
    serious gravity for Article 8 to be engaged.

18. The Respondent's decision was in accordance with the  law  and  pursued
    the legitimate aim of maintaining effective immigration control.

19. I turn to the  question  of  proportionality.   Having  regard  to  the
    mandatory factors set out in section 117B of the NIAA 2002 and  in  the
    light of relevant case-law, I adopt a "balance sheet" approach.




Factors in the Respondent's favour

20. The Appellant is, and has been since 2005, an overstayer.   The  public
    interest in this, as in  any  case,  is  a  very  weighty  factor.   In
    addition, the Rules are there to be met and an inability to do so is  a
    matter that reinforces the general public interest.  In this  case  the
    Appellant is unable to meet  all  of  the  requirements  of  the  Rules
    because of the "partner" issue discussed above.  There is of  course  a
    general expectation that people should be able to meet the requirements
    of the Rules or, if they cannot, leave the United Kingdom  to  make  an
    appropriate entry clearance application from abroad.  I of course  bear
    in mind the fact that the Appellant's relationship with his partner was
    established at a time when he was in this country unlawfully.   On  the
    face of it, this clearly reduces the weight attributable to his  family
    life with his partner and her  two  children.  Although  the  financial
    independence factor under section 117B(2) would appear to count against
    the  Appellant,  the  satisfaction  of  EX.1  then  suggests  that  the
    inability to meet the relevant income threshold  can  be  'neutralised'
    (see discussion, below). For current purposes, I will count the lack of
    income against the Appellant.

  Factors in the Appellant's favour

21. Although he is unable to meet each and every  requirement  of  Appendix
    FM, something more needs to be said about this issue.  In light of what
    the  First-tier  Tribunal  judge  said,  and  my   interpretation   and
    preservation thereof,  there  are  "insurmountable  obstacles"  to  the
    partner going to live with  the  Appellant  on  a  permanent  basis  in
    Pakistan.  That point was not contradicted by the Respondent either  at
    the error of law hearing or at any time before  the  remaking  hearing.
    With respect to Ms Kenny, some aspects of her submissions  have  rather
    given the impression that this issue remains live.  I conclude that  it
    is not, and this is so for two reasons.  First, because of what  I  set
    out in clear terms in my error  of  law  decision  at  [16]  and  [26].
    Second, and in any event, the circumstances of this case  clearly  show
    that insurmountable obstacles exist.  The Appellant's partner  has  two
    children, neither of which are permitted to live with her.  She  has  a
    loving parental relationship with both of them.   It  would  be  wholly
    against the children's best interests for their mother  to  effectively
    abandon them in this country and go and live in Pakistan.  There is  no
    question that the partner is in some way at "fault" for the  children's
    situation (the background to their residence at her  mother's  has  not
    been explored at any stage and in fairness, Ms Kenny has not sought  to
    rely on what would  be  an  unattractive  submission).   The  partner's
    daughter sees her biological father and is clearly well  cared  for  by
    her loving grandmother, but would certainly need to have her mother  in
    her life.  As for the son, his additional challenges and the fact  that
    he has no contact with his biological father  whatsoever  would  render
    the effective  disappearance  of  his  mother  from  his  life  utterly
    unconscionable and certainly disproportionate.

22. In these circumstances the Appellant's partner cannot leave the  United
    Kingdom and could not have left at any time  during  the  relationship.
    This being the case, the Appellant  can  show  that  he  hypothetically
    meets the requirements of EX.1 of Appendix FM.  This has the effect  in
    turn of, as it were, 'neutralising' his inability to meet  the  minimum
    financial threshold and lack of immigration status  (see  R-LTRP.1.1(d)
    of the Appendix).  It  follows  from  this  that  the  Appellant  would
    succeed in an in-country application for leave to  remain  if  such  an
    application were now made.

23. Although certain aspects of Ms Kenny's submissions might have indicated
    that the Respondent was suggesting that a permanent separation  between
    the Appellant and his partner would be  proportionate,  that  does  not
    logically follow from the existence of insurmountable obstacles and the
    significance of this to the framework  of  the  Rules  themselves.   If
    significant weight is to be attached to the Rules, as it must, this  is
    so whether they operate in favour of or against a particular appellant.
    Here, they in fact act in his favour  by  permitting  him  to  say,  in
    effect, that the Respondent's decision must be disproportionate  unless
    there is a good reason why he should go back to Pakistan alone and make
    an entry clearance application.  This is because the Rules reflect what
    the Respondent regards as being the fair balance between the rights  of
    the  individual  and  the  public  interest.  Those  Rules  (including,
    importantly, EX.1) provide that an individual  will  succeed  in  their
    application (an application which is course  predicated  entirely  upon
    Article 8) if, along  with  other  criteria,  EX.1  is  satisfied.  The
    significance of such  compliance  with  the  Rules  has  recently  been
    highlighted by the Court of Appeal in TZ  (Pakistan)  [2018]  EWCA  Civ
    1109, at paragraph 34.

24. I now turn to the  Chikwamba  point.   Although  Ms  Elliott-Kelly  has
    submitted that the Chikwamba issue does not even arise in  the  context
    of this appeal, in my view it is prudent to deal with  its  merits  for
    the sake of completeness.

25. In my view there are two reasons why no sensible reason exists for  the
    Appellant to make an entry clearance application from Pakistan,  or  to
    put it another way, it would be  disproportionate  to  require  him  to
    pursue this particular route.  Either reason suffices.

26.  First,  as  it  now  stands  and  in  light  of  the  conclusion  that
    insurmountable obstacles exist, the Appellant meets all of the relevant
    provisions of Appendix FM as  regards  an  in-country  application  for
    leave to remain.  The only barrier to him succeeding within the context
    of the Rules in this appeal  is,  as  has  been  discussed  previously,
    because his partner could not be considered a "partner" as at the  date
    of the human rights claim in 2016.  That particular barrier  would  now
    of course fall away were a fresh  hypothetical  in-country  application
    made.  However, if the Appellant were to go back to Pakistan  and  make
    an entry clearance application from there it  is  entirely  clear  that
    this would be doomed to failure.  This is because he simply  could  not
    meet the minimum income threshold and also,  unlike  in  an  in-country
    application, could not rely on EX.1 because  this  does  not  apply  to
    entry clearance  applications.   Therefore,  he  would  effectively  be
    marooned in Pakistan thus giving rise to the very significant chance of
    a permanent separation from his partner.   The  "safety  net"  of  EX.1
    would not be available and the Respondent's ability to try and  justify
    a temporary separation would face its own insurmountable obstacle.

27. Second, even a temporary absence would have significant consequences in
    the context  of  this  case.   The  Appellant's  partner  suffers  from
    significant health conditions which have caused her to be  hospitalised
    on several occasions in recent months.  She is unable to turn to anyone
    else for meaningful support.  There would  be,  I  conclude,  genuinely
    adverse consequences for her  if  the  Appellant  were  to  leave.   In
    respect of the children, as has been said previously, they are entirely
    unaware of the Appellant's immigration circumstances.  If  he  were  to
    leave without warning  or  explanation  this  would  cause  significant
    distress and be adverse to their best interests.   Alternatively,  even
    if they were to be told  of  what  was  happening,  their  age  and  in
    particular the son's difficulties would  still  be  contrary  to  their
    overall wellbeing.  The best interests/section 55 factor is  of  course
    highly significant.

Neutral factor

28. The Appellant speaks excellent English and this is, as the law  stands,
    a neutral factor.

Overall evaluative judgment

29. Having weighed up all relevant factors I conclude that this is  a  very
    strong Article 8 claim with compelling features such that the Appellant
    can show that the Respondent's decision does not strike a fair  balance
    between his protected rights on the one hand and the  important  public
    interest on the other.

30. In essence, the combination of the  insurmountable  obstacles  and  the
    absence of a reasonable entry clearance option  goes  to  outweigh  the
    important public interest matters.

31. In these circumstances I allow the Appellant's appeal.



Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
law and I set it aside.

I remake the decision by determining that the Respondent's  refusal  of  the
Appellant's human rights claim is unlawful under  section  6  of  the  Human
Rights Act 1998.

I therefore allow the Appellant's appeal.

TO THE RESPONDENT

FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make  a  fee  award
of �140.00. the Appellant has succeeded in  his  appeal  and  there  are  no
sound reasons to reduce the award.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.



                            DECISION AND REASONS

32. This is a challenge by the Appellant against the decision of First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Kaler (the judge), promulgated 27 February 2018, in
    which she dismissed his appeal against the Respondent's refusal, dated
    27 October 2016, of his human rights claim.  That refusal followed an
    application made on 11 May 2016, which was based on the following
    circumstances.  The Appellant had a British citizen partner, with whom
    he lived.  The partner has two children from a previous relationship.
    Due to particular circumstances, those children live with their
    grandmother rather than the partner, although the latter saw her
    children on a regular basis.

The judge's decision

33. The judge accepted that the Appellant and his partner had been in a
    genuine and subsisting relationship since 2014, and that they had
    cohabited since at least August 2015.  The Appellant had at all
    material times been in this country on a precarious basis.  At [15],
    the judge found that it was open to the Appellant to return to Pakistan
    and make an entry clearance application from there.  A temporary
    separation would not have a disproportionate impact on his relationship
    with his partner.

34. The judge goes on to find that the Appellant did not have a parental
    relationship with either of his partner's children.  At [18] she
    states:

"They have come to know the Appellant as the mother's partner but they do
not live together as a family, and have never done so.  I do not accept
that they have established family life with the Appellant.  I am not
persuaded that the absence of the Appellant would have a significant impact
on the wellbeing of these children.  That [X] is developing a closer bond
with the Appellant is noted but his best interests lie in his being in a
loving and protected environment with his grandmother, and not in having
regular contact with the Appellant."

35. At [19] the judge accepted that it would be "harsh" to expect the
    partner to leave the United Kingdom, given the circumstances of her two
    children.  Finally, the judge attaches considerable weight to the
    Respondent's guardianship of the public interest and concludes that the
    interference with the Appellant's family life was proportionate.  On
    this basis the appeal was dismissed.

The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

36. The grounds make the following points.  It is said that the judge
    failed to consider to what extent the Appellant could meet the various
    requirements of the Rules (specifically Appendix FM) as at the date of
    hearing.  This, it is said, was relevant to whether the Respondent's
    decision was proportionate.  It is also asserted that the judge failed
    to deal adequately with the two children's best interests insofar as
    they related to the Appellant's presence in their lives.  There is no
    challenge to the judges conclusions on paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi).

37. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Page by a
    decision dated 26 April 2018.

The hearing before me

38. Ms Revill referred me to paragraph 34 of TZ (Pakistan) [2018] EWCA Civ
    1109.  The question of whether there would be insurmountable obstacles
    to the partner going to live in Pakistan was relevant to an Article 8
    claim outside of the context of the Immigration Rules.  She also
    referred me to the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Tikka [2018] EWCA
    Civ 642.  Here, as in that case, any entry clearance application was,
    she submitted, bound to fail: in the present case the partner's income
    was well below the minimum threshold of �18,600 required under Appendix
    FM.  This was a relevant factor that the judge had failed to consider.
    The ability, or otherwise, of an individual to satisfy the relevant
    Rules was, in the light of recent case law, relevant.  I was referred
    specifically to the cases just mentioned and Agyarko [2017] UKSC 11.

39. Ms Revill submitted that the judge's approach to the best interests
    issue was insufficient.  Whilst it was clearly the case that the
    children's best interests lay in living with their maternal
    grandmother, the judge should also have considered whether or not those
    interests had an additional element to them, namely whether this
    included having contact with the Appellant (him being their mother's
    partner).  She submitted that what is said in [18] is inadequate.

40. Ms Isherwood submitted that the combination of [6], [16], [17] and [18]
    of the judge's decision is adequate in respect of the best interests
    question.  In relation to [19], she accepted that the judge was
    concluding that the partner could not be expected to leave the United
    Kingdom, and this was the effect of the use of the term "harsh".
    However, it was open to the judge to conclude that the Appellant could
    go to Pakistan and make an entry clearance application.  It was
    unattractive to say that an individual who simply could not meet the
    Rules would be in a stronger position than an individual who
    potentially could and took it upon themselves to go and make an entry
    clearance application.

41. In reply Ms Revill submitted that the possibility of making an entry
    clearance application was not determinative of an Article 8 claim
    outside the context of the Rules.  The same applied to the question of
    whether insurmountable obstacles existed.

42. At the end of the hearing I reserved my decision.

Decision on Error of Law

43. After careful thought, I have concluded that there are material errors
    in the judge's decision. This conclusion is based upon the following
    matters.

44. With respect, the findings and conclusions of the judge in respect of
    the overall Article 8 assessment are not all entirely clear. She has
    not, for example, stated in clear terms that the Appellant was unable
    to meet the requirements of Appendix FM. However, from the finding at
    [13] that cohabitation had only begun in August 2015, I deduce that the
    requirements could not be relied on. The human rights claim (the
    relevant application) was made on 11 May 2016, and therefore there had
    not been at least two years of cohabitation prior to the application.
    In turn, the Appellant's partner was not in fact a "partner" within the
    meaning of GEN.1.2(iv) of appendix FM. This was itself a decisive, if
    technical, factor in respect of the ability (or rather inability) to
    satisfy the rules, including EX.1.

45. In light of the above, the judge was considering the Article 8 claim
    outside of the context of the Rules. In so doing, the judge was
    required, as an initial step in the overall exercise, to assess to what
    extent, if at all, the Appellant could meet the various requirements of
    the Rules as at the date of hearing (see, for example, paragraph 48 of
    Agyarko and paragraphs 31-34 of TZ (Pakistan)).

46. She had, by virtue of her finding on cohabitation, concluded that the
    Appellant was in a genuine and subsisting relationship and was, as at
    the date of hearing, able to show that his partner was indeed his
    "partner" within the meaning of the rules.

47. Two important matters then arise. The first is whether or not there
    would be "insurmountable obstacles" to the Appellant's family life
    continuing outside of the United Kingdom (i.e. in Pakistan). There is
    no specific finding by the judge on this important matter. This in
    itself would be a significant error of law. However, by common consent
    at the hearing, it was agreed that the reference in [19] to it being
    "harsh to expect the Sponsor to leave the UK" denotes a conclusion that
    such obstacles did in fact exist, and that the basis on which I am
    considering the judges decision.

48. Whilst her implicit conclusion could not have permitted the Appellant
    to succeed in his appeal with reference to the Rules themselves (by
    virtue of what I have said in paragraph 13, above), it was clearly a
    highly relevant factor in the overall proportionality exercise. That
    relevance is highlighted, if not increased, by the fact that it was
    only the operation of GEN.1.2(iv) of appendix FM which, having regard
    to the implicit conclusion, defeated the Appellant's claim within the
    context of the rules,

49. In my view, the judge has failed to factor in this important conclusion
    when conducting the proportionality exercise. The very brief reference
    in [19] to it being "harsh" to expect the sponsor to leave United
    Kingdom is insufficient. If the conclusion was in fact taken into
    account, there are inadequate reasons for why this appears to have
    carried no weight in the overall assessment. There is an error here.

50. As rightly acknowledged by Ms Revill, the insurmountable obstacles
    conclusion would not have been determinative in the Appellant's favour.
    However, it was very clearly a highly material issue.

51. The second matter arising relates to the financial requirements under
    Appendix FM. The judge was of the view that the Appellant could return
    to Pakistan alone and make an entry clearance application (see [15]).
    However, at [6] the judge noted the evidence of that the Appellant's
    partner earned just �16,200 a year. It appears as though the Appellant
    was not himself earning. Therefore, on the evidence before her, the
    minimum income threshold of �18,600 was clearly not met. There is
    unfortunately no finding to this effect. In any event, taking the
    claimed income as an accurate reflection of the couple's circumstances,
    any application for entry clearance would clearly be doomed to failure,
    at least under the Rules.

52. It is of course the case that any application for entry clearance would
    not only be considered under the rules but in light of the Respondent's
    residual discretion under Article 8. The question arising in that
    scenario is as follows: given the judge's conclusion that the Appellant
    partner could not follow him to Pakistan to live, given that the
    couple's income was insufficient to meet the financial requirements
    under Appendix FM, and in the absence of any suitability issues, would
    entry clearance have to be granted to the Appellant in order to be
    compatible with his protected Article 8 rights? This set of
    circumstances has not been dealt with by the judge. It may be that this
    is because there has not been a more logical, methodical approach
    undertaken, in line with the pathway recommended in TZ (Pakistan),
    amongst other cases.

53. The answer to the question just posed is not certain, but was relevant
    to the Chikwamba issue. In my view, the judge has failed to engage with
    this issue, and this represents a second material error in her
    decision.

54. The two errors identified above are sufficient for me to set the judges
    decision aside.

55. In respect of the best interests issue, I am less convinced by the
    merits of Ms Revill's argument. [16] - [18] do indicate that the judge
    had relevant matters in mind and addressed the relevant relationships
    in the children's lives. Having said that, there was evidence before
    the judge to indicate that at least one of the children had, by the
    date of the hearing, established somewhat more of a connection than is
    perhaps recognised in the decision (see [5] and [6]. In saying this, I
    bear in mind that the particular child as conditions which might have
    been relevant to his perception of the Appellant and the impact of a
    separation.



Disposal

56. Having set the judges decision aside, I will retain it in the Upper
    Tribunal and remake the decision at a resumed hearing in due course.

57. There is now no dispute about either the nature of the Appellant's
    relationship with his partner, the fact that she cannot be expected to
    go and live in Pakistan, or the factual circumstances relating to the
    partner's children.

58.  The issues to be addressed at the resumed hearing will include whether
    the Appellant should return to Pakistan alone and make an entry
    clearance application. The question of the full extent of the
    children's best interests can also be the subject of evidence and
    submissions. Oral evidence will be permitted, but only on a limited
    basis. I issue directions to the parties, below.



Notice of Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

I adjourn the appeal for a resumed hearing before me in due course.



Anonymity direction made because this appeal concerns  children  subject  to
an order of the Family Court.





Signed   [pic]         Date: 1 July 2018

Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Norton-Taylor



Directions to the parties

   1.  Any further evidence relied on by either party shall  be  filed  with
      the Upper Tribunal  in  accordance  with  rule  15(2A)  of  the  Upper
      Tribunal Procedure Rules and served on the other side no later than 21
      days before the resumed hearing;

   2. On the Appellant's side, no oral evidence will be permitted unless  an
      updated witness statement is produced, addressing the  issues  of  the
      children's best interests and  the  possibility  of  making  an  entry
      clearance application.
