For the Respondent:    Miss J Isherwood, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh born on 9 April  1979  and  he
    made an application for entry clearance to the United  Kingdom  as  the
    partner of Halima Begum which  was  refused.  The  respondent  was  not
    satisfied that the appellant met the requirements of  Appendix  FM.  In
    particular the respondent was  not  satisfied  the  appellant  met  the
    eligibility requirements of the partner under EC-P1.1(d) because he was
    not satisfied  the  claimed  relationship  between  the  appellant  and
    sponsor  was  subsisting  or  that  they  intended  to  live   together
    permanently in the United Kingdom.

 2. E-ECP2.6 and 2.10.  In addition the sponsor was not satisfied that  the
    appellant met the financial requirements  set  out  in  E-ECP3.1.   The
    sponsor was paid in cash and whilst bank statements and wage slips  had
    been provided, the corresponding deposits   were  made  into  the  bank
    account at least ten days after  payslip  date.   The  Entry  Clearance
    Officer had "concerns" regarding the claimed employment and income. The
    sponsor's salary slips showed the exact same amount  of net  pay  which
    should vary slightly, depending on  the  change  of  tax  payable  each
    month. No P60s for employment had been provided. It was  accepted  that
    the sponsor may be employed  by  SF  London  Limited  but  it  was  not
    accepted that her income was as claimed.  The application  was  refused
    under paragraph EC-P1.1(d) of Appendix FM (E-EEC-E.3.1)

 3. A further reason for refusal was that appellant had submitted  an  ESOL
    entry level certificate in both speaking and listening  from  City  and
    Guilds dated 5 September 2012 from Test Centre 82146 as evidence of the
    English language proficiency but the Entry Clearance  Officer  was  not
    satisfied these documents demonstrated  the  appellant  had  passed  an
    English language test in speaking and listening at a minimum  level  A1
    of  the  Common  European  Framework  of   Reference   for   Languages.
    Investigations had confirmed  that  the  documents  submitted  did  not
    reliably demonstrate that she had passed the stated qualification.  The
    application was refused under paragraph EC-P.1.1(d) of Appendix FM   of
    the Immigration Rules.

 4. An Entry Clearance Manager's review on 28 April 2014 upheld  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer's decision and found  that  it  was  noted  that  the
    appellant had included two City and  Guilds  certificates  as  evidence
    that she satisfied the requirements of the Immigration  Rules  but  the
    Entry Clearance Officer had pointed out that  investigations  conducted
    by City  and  Guilds  and  UK  Immigration  and  Visas  Dhaka  revealed
    inconsistencies  in  testing  in  Bangladesh.   As  a  result  of   the
    investigation  the  ECO  was  not  satisfied  that  the  documents  the
    appellant had provided demonstrated she had obtained the qualifications
    mentioned on the certificate.  The inconsistencies had  been  addressed
    by City and Guilds who agreed to offer retesting to all  affected  visa
    applicants and the visa was issued with a letter alongside her  refusal
    notice explaining this and she was  offered  a  gratis  retest  but  no
    retest had been submitted.

 5. In a decision dated 29 September 2014 Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal
    Dean dismissed the appellant's appeal  on  the  basis  that  there  was
    insufficient telephone  evidence  before  him  to  demonstrate  to  the
    required standard that the appellant and sponsor were in  communication
    after the sponsor left  Bangladesh  in  2012.   The  evidence  did  not
    advance the appellant's claim that his relationship  with  his  sponsor
    was subsisting.

 6. The appellant appealed on the basis in part that telephone cards  could
    be taken into account and the telephone call record cover page  clearly
    mentioned the sponsor's name and address and her  account  number  with
    the company but the judge failed  to  acknowledge  this  evidence.  The
    judge failed to make any further findings in relation to the  financial
    requirements and the English language requirement but concluded on  the
    basis of EC-P1.1(d) of Appendix FM  of the Rules that  the  appellant's
    appeal should be dismissed.

 7. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Shimmin
    on the grounds that the judge erred in failing to give  weight  to  the
    phone cards and take into account the telephone call  records  and  the
    recent travel to see the appellant.  It was  arguable  that  the  judge
    should have given weight to the phone cards and telephone call records.



The Hearing

 8. At the hearing Mr Chowdhury stated that he had  no  appellant's  bundle
    and therefore attempted to submit a further bundle which he stated  was
    a copy before the First-tier Tribunal.  This, as it transpired, was not
    the case as there were documents included which were not in the  bundle
    before the judge.  It appeared that the indexed bundle before the First
    Tier Tribunal Judge included pages 1-31 with a Talk Home Call log  from
    1st February 2014 to 14th May 2014.  In addition there were two  copies
    of greetings cards without envelopes and a copy of a  TalkTalk  account
    for telephone number 0203 6591073.  This included a  summary  of  calls
    from 1 March 2013 to 31 March 2013 and a TalkTalk account  number  with
    the appellant's sponsor's address as being Flat 1, 29 Parkside  Estate,
    Rutland Road, London E9.   The  latter  documentation  in  relation  to
    telephone calls comprised two pages.

 9. Mr Chowdhury submitted that the judge had  stated  that  the  telephone
    cards carried very little weight and this did not follow  the  guidance
    of Goudey (Subsisting marriage evidence) Sudan [2012] UKUT 00041  which
    confirmed that the evidence  of  a  matrimonial  relationship  did  not
    require the production of particular evidence of  mutual  devotion  and
    that evidence of telephone cards was capable of being corroborative  of
    the contention of the parties that they communicated by  telephone even
    if such data could not confirm the particular number  the  sponsor  was
    calling in the country in question.  It was not a requirement that  the
    parties also wrote or texted each other.

10. It was clear from paragraph 10 that the judge accepted  the  call  logs
    but the judge rejected this  evidence  and  did  not  place  sufficient
    weight upon it.

11. In paragraph 12 the judge failed to consider post-dated evidence  which
    could be taken into account when deciding that two  years  had  elapsed
    after the marriage and before the sponsor had made a  decision  to  try
    and visit  him.  the parties had been  in communication and  there  was
    no such separation. The judge had also stated at paragraph 15 that  the
    appellant's wife had failed to give credible evidence  in  relation  to
    her visits but in fact there was no discrepancy in  the  evidence.   Mr
    Chowdhury also stated that the address of 120 Park  Street  could  have
    been confused with 129 Rutland Road because in fact the address was 129
    Parkside Estate.  I pointed out to Mr Chowdhury that it  appeared  that
    the telephone numbers on the mobile phone log differed from that  given
    in the Visa Application Form of the sponsor's mobile phone.

12.  Mr  Chowdhury  submitted  that  there  had  been  difficulty  in   the
    appellant's  sponsor's  instructing  solicitors  but   there   was   no
    contradiction to Miss Isherwood's submission that no complaint had been
    made or indeed no evidence  had  been  produced  in  this  regard.   Mr
    Chowdhury also submitted that the judge had failed to consider the  two
    further grounds of projection by the Entry Clearance Officer, that  was
    maintenance and language certificates.

13. The sponsor was twice asked when she commenced work with SF Limited and
    she confirmed that it was in October 2012 for the first time.

14. Miss Isherwood contested that the appellant could succeed on the  basis
    of the financial requirements because she could not show that  she  had
    earned �18,600 in the previous year.

15. Miss Isherwood submitted that there were some money receipts after  the
    date of decision but Mr Chowdhury disputed them although once again the
    receipts in the further evidence that Mr Chowdhury had compiled did not
    coincide with those in the Entry Clearance Officer's bundle.

Conclusions

16. Had the judge only relied on the  evidence  that  the  telephone  cards
    added little weight to the claim the marriage  was  subsisting  because
    the cards did not have the name or personal details of the  person  who
    used the cards, I would have agreed that there was an error of law.  It
    would appear that these telephone cards were returned to the appellant.
    However, the judge in a determination which ran from paragraphs 7 to 20
    looked at the totality of the evidence before him and  considered  that
    the appellant had not submitted evidence to the  required  standard  to
    demonstrate that he satisfied the relationship requirements.

17. The judge did not confine  himself  merely  to  the  criticism  of  the
    telephone cards (which were  not  re-presented  before  me)  but  noted
    discrepancies in the sponsor's evidence.  He recorded that the  sponsor
    had submitted a witness statement in which she  had  incorrectly  given
    the year of the marriage being that as 2014 although the marriage  took
    place in 2012, and he noted at [9] of his decision  that  'as  evidence
    that the marriage is subsisting the appellant submitted 'two  greetings
    cards, four money receipts and some telephone cards'.  He  stated  with
    respect to the telephone cards that 'they did  not  have  the  name  or
    personal details of the person who used the cards'.  The  judge  stated
    that the phone cards  added  "little  weight  to  the  claim  that  the
    marriage is subsisting" [9]. Goudey is  proposition  that  evidence  of
    telephone cards is capable of being corroborative of the contention  of
    the parties that they communicate but in these circumstances the  judge
    considered that it was not the case.  He considered the evidence of the
    relationship of the parties in the round and specifically  referred  to
    the sponsor's oral evidence.

18. At paragraph 10 he considered the UK  mobile  telephone  logs  for  the
    period 1st February 2014 to 14 May 2014.  The judge stated  that  'this
    has no account holder name and address and therefore I find  that  this
    does not advance the appellant's claim that his relationship  with  the
    sponsor is  subsisting'.   Indeed,  I  note  that,  the  mobile  number
    attached to this log did not have the same number that the sponsor gave
    in her VAF as her mobile number. There was nothing to  link  this  with
    the sponsor.   The grounds of appeal submitted that the  appellant  and
    sponsor contacted each other 'regularly' through internet  video  calls
    and telephone calls but the telephone evidence prior  to  the  decision
    and from 2013 was for one month only.

19. There were two pages of telephone evidence (Talk Talk  Telephone  bill)
    which had the appellant's sponsor's name  and  address  and  the  judge
    referred to this at [18].  It is this evidence that had  the  sponsor's
    name and address but this judge identified the inconsistency  given  in
    the oral evidence of the sponsor with  regards  her  address  and  thus
    rejected this evidence.    The judge clearly recorded at [18] that  the
    sponsor when first asked her address responded it was 120 Park  Street.
    Mr Chowdhury submitted that this was not a far cry  from  129  Parkside
    Estate, Rutland Road, but the judge found that this conflicted with the
    one telephone bill given by the sponsor.  I note that the sponsor had a
    Bengali interpreter at the hearing.

20. Having already noted the telephone cards  and  telephone  records  from
    2013 and earlier in the year, cards and financial remittances the judge
    reasoned at [11]

    'No other evidence of communication,  whether  written,  electronic  or
    telephonic has been submitted  to  establish  that  the  appellant  and
    sponsor remain in contact and I therefore find that when taken  in  the
    round, the evidence before me undermines the appellant's claim that his
    relationship with the sponsor is subsisting'.

21. The judge did take the evidence of telephone contact into  account  but
    placed little weight on it and overall rejected  the  evidence  as  the
    appellant and sponsor appeared to have not maintained the contact.

22. The judge did consider the visits made by the sponsor to Bangladesh  in
    that she arrived in Bangladesh on 12 June 2014 and  left  on  3  August
    2014 but considered that there had been  considerable  lapses  in  time
    since the marriage. It was submitted that the application had been made
    in May 2013 but it was the lack of effort to visit and the  explanation
    for the lack of visits which the judge detailed as being problematical.
     The judge also took into account the oral evidence to the effect  that
    the sponsor did not visit Bangladesh until she knew of the date of  the
    appeal.

23. It is correct to state, as Mr Chowdhury did, that the visa  application
    was submitted in May 2013  but  this  does  not  preclude  the  sponsor
    visiting the appellant.  In  particular,  the  judge  at  paragraph  15
    identified that the sponsor stated that  she  had  to  wait  two  years
    because she was working and not given holidays  but  then  contradicted
    her evidence stating that in fact she was given holidays.

24. In  particular,  the  judge  found  that  overall  the  sponsor  was  a
    "reluctant witness  who  gave  too  implausible  explanations  for  not
    visiting her husband in Bangladesh" [16]. The judge did not state as it
    claimed in the application for permission to  appeal  that  the  couple
    lost contact with each other between May 2012 and June 2014.

25. Clearly the judge found that  the  intermittent  money  receipts  added
    little by way of assistance  to  support  the  claim  of  a  subsisting
    relationship. The judge had referred to the  four  money  receipts  and
    even if he did not specifically  identify  these  separately  into  his
    reasoning he clearly found that overall  the  contact,  including  just
    four money receipts from  2012/2013,  were  insufficient.   An  overall
    reading on this is clear.

26. The respondent's decision was made on 6th August 2013 and  although  it
    was submitted that the judge did not post decision evidence contrary to
    Naz (subsisting marriage - standard of proof) Pakistan [2012] UKUT  40,
    that is not the case.  At paragraph [10]  the  judge  referred  to  the
    mobile phone call log from 1st February 2014 to 14th May  2014  and  to
    the visit made by the sponsor to Bangladesh following the decision. The
    judge chose not to place much weight on this evidence for  the  reasons
    set out but he nonetheless took it into account.

27. From the telephone evidence produced, including that  with  a  landline
    number, albeit postdating  the  decision,  there  was  not  one  direct
    telephone link between the sponsor and the appellant. In  Goudey  there
    was evidence not just of telephone cards but also of regular  financial
    remittances and a 'considerable volume of material' which could not  be
    said to be the case before the first tier tribunal.   At [10] of Goudey
    the court held that 'the material gives corroborative support  for  the
    wife's testimony in  the  appeal.   It  is  clear  that  a  great  many
    telephone calls have been made using the  telephone  cards  during  the
    prior of the relationship'.  That cannot said to be the case  here  and
    there was no indication that the judge had imposed his own view of  how
    the parties should communicate.  The  judge  heard  evidence  from  the
    sponsor  and   found   that   the   evidence   before   him   contained
    'inconsistencies and discrepancies' and 'implausible  explanation'  and
    that 'looking at the totality of the evidence' the  appellant  did  not
    succeed.

28. The decision was made on the evidence presented and I do not accept  Mr
    Chowdhury's submission  that  a  finding  on  the  subsistence  of  the
    marriage will preclude any further application and it is  open  to  the
    appellant and sponsor to make a further application  on  the  basis  of
    further evidence.  That said I am only considering whether the decision
    contained an error of law. There was also criticism that the judge  had
    made  no  findings  with  respect  to  the   financial   and   language
    requirements. That said, I note the independent tax records from  HMRC,
    indicate that the sponsor earned only  �12,881 in the  tax  year  2012-
    2013.  I note the application was made on 5th May 2013.  However  as  I
    found no error of  law  regarding  the  deficiencies  in  the  evidence
    regarding the relationship, I find this failure by  the  judge  is  not
    material.

29. Overall the judge rejected on  the  balance  of  probabilities  on  the
    evidence put forward by the  sponsor  regarding  the  relationship  and
    based this on the oral evidence in  conjunction  with  the  documentary
    evidence. It was open to the judge to come to the conclusions  that  he
    did on the evidence which was presented to him and overall I find  that
    the reasoning is adequate.

30. I find no error of law which is material and the decision will stand.
