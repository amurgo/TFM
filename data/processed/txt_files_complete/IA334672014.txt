                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department
    with permission, against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge
    Bruce) in which it allowed A N N P's appeal against  the  Secretary  of
    State's decision to refuse her leave to remain  on  the  basis  of  her
    family/private life and to remove her to Vietnam.

 2. For the purposes of continuity I shall refer, in this decision, to  the
    Secretary of State as "the Respondent" and A N N P as "the  Appellant",
    which  reflects  their  respective  positions  before  the   First-tier
    Tribunal.

 3. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis that it was arguable that
    the FtT Judge may have erred in;

      i) misdirecting herself on the meaning of "financially independent" in
         Section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002
         (as amended)

     ii) failing to take into account and weigh in the balance, the  Article
         8 rights of the Appellant's 6 year old child residing in Vietnam;

    iii) attaching too great  a  weight  to  the  relationship  between  the
         Appellant and her UK partner which began, and continued,  when  the
         Appellant was unlawfully in the UK;

     iv) failing to give adequate reasons for finding as she did "that there
         was absolutely no prospect in future" that the Appellant  would  be
         able to return to the UK;

      v) giving too much weight to the rights of an unborn child.

 4. By the time of the hearing before me, the Appellant had given birth  to
    her son EDK on 3rd August 2015. (Birth certificate produced). EDK is of
    course a British child.

Background

 5. The Appellant is a Vietnamese  national  born  29th  August  1983.  She
    entered the UK on 14th February 2010, in possession of a  Student  Visa
    valid until 30th October 2011. She completed an IELTs course.

 6. In January 2011 she met a Mr N a British citizen. They entered  into  a
    relationship and were married on 23rd July 2012. The Appellant did  not
    leave the UK when her visa expired in 2011 but overstayed.

 7. The Appellant claimed that she was  subject  to  sexual,  physical  and
    emotional abuse from Mr N. She left him therefore on 26th November 2013
    and reported the abuse to the police.  On  30th  January  2015  he  was
    convicted on two charges of ABH. He is now serving a term of four years
    six  months  imprisonment.  The   Appellant   has   initiated   divorce
    proceedings against him, but this process has become protracted because
    of his lack of cooperation.

 8. In January 2014 she met Mr K another  British  citizen.  They  began  a
    relationship and moved in together in March 2014. At the  time  of  the
    hearing before the FtT, the Appellant was pregnant with Mr K's child  -
    the baby EDK was born on 3rd August 2015.

 9. Mr K is employed as a graphic designer and earns  approximately  �1,200
    to �2,000 per month. The Appellant applied for leave to remain  outside
    the Immigration Rules but this was on the  basis  of  her  relationship
    with her husband Mr N. This application was refused on 3rd October 2013
    with no right of appeal. She applied again on 18th March for  leave  to
    remain but the application was  voided  on  22nd  April  2014.  It  was
    resubmitted on 29th April 2014 and refused by the  Respondent  on  24th
    July 2014. It is the appeal against this refusal which  was  heard  and
    allowed by the FtT.

10. When the appeal came before the FtT, it was accepted by  the  Appellant
    that she could not meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules.  The
    sole issue therefore was whether her removal would be contrary  to  her
    Article 8 ECHR ,private/family life rights. The FtT  judge  found  that
    circumstances of the Appellant's case were such that it required her to
    look outside the "complete code" of the Rules.  This  she  did  and  in
    doing so went on to allow the appeal under Article 8.

Error of law/Consideration

11. I heard submissions from both parties. After hearing those submissions,
    I find I am able to deal with points (i) and (ii), set out in paragraph
    3 above, briefly, since I find they are not material to the conclusions
    reached by the FtT. I say this for the following reasons. I accept that
    the FtT  Judge  wrongly  described  the  Appellant  at  [19]  as  "self
    sufficient". She is not; nor is she  financially  independent.  She  is
    wholly dependent upon the financial resources of her British partner Mr
    K. However the FtT found as a fact, he has adequate financial resources
    to maintain her and is willing to do so.  There  is  no  evidence  (and
    there was none before the FtT) that there is  any  reliance  on  public
    funds. I  am  satisfied  therefore  that  although  the  FtT  erred  in
    describing the Appellant as 'self sufficient', when plainly she is not,
    nevertheless it was entitled to take into account the fact  that  Mr  K
    was both financially capable  of  and  willing  to  maintain  her  when
    deciding what weight to give to  the  public  interest  in  maintaining
    immigration control. This error is not material.

12. Equally, I am satisfied that nothing turns on the FtT's failing to take
    into account evidence that the Appellant has a 6 year old child  living
    with  his  grandparents  in  Vietnam.  That  child   is   outwith   the
    jurisdiction. I fail to see how the uncertain future prospect  of  that
    child  joining  his  mother  in  the  UK,   amounts   to   a   material
    consideration. The time  for  any  consideration  of  that  prospective
    application will be if and when such an application is made. Presumably
    any such application will be made for him to enter as  the  Appellant's
    dependent child and will be successful only if the relevant Immigration
    Rules are met.

13. I turn now to the remaining grounds upon which permission was  granted.
    These revolve around the central pillars of the Appellant's case as put
    before the FtT. The Judge in reaching  her  conclusions  properly  took
    into account the fact that the Appellant was pregnant. I  have  already
    noted above, by the time of the hearing before me,  the  Appellant  had
    recently given birth to her child EDK. The child's father  Mr  K  is  a
    British citizen. The child , therefore, is also a British citizen.

14. The Judge considered it to be artificial to discount the fact  that  at
    the time of the hearing before her, the child was unborn. It is hard to
    see that the Judge was wrong in that. What else should she do in  these
    circumstances? I suppose she could have said  that  as  the  child  was
    unborn,  his  prospective  presence  should  be   excluded   from   her
    assessment, but as she said that would  be  wholly  artificial.  I  see
    nothing wrong in that reasoning. Indeed by the  very  nature  of  these
    matters, by the time of the hearing before me the child  was  born.  It
    seems to me that much of the argument on this point  is  now  academic.
    The Judge, found with reasons that the  Appellant  had  a  relationship
    with the child's father Mr K, to which she gave little weight, but gave
    great weight to the fact of the Appellant's pregnancy no doubt  because
    she kept in mind the fact that a British child would  be  born  in  the
    reasonably foreseeable future. The interests of that child fell  to  be
    weighed in the balance as a primary consideration

15. Weighing those factors into the balance, she found that it would not be
    reasonable to expect the Appellant's partner to give  up  his  job  and
    home because if he did, she was satisfied, there would be  no  prospect
    of his being employed in Vietnam and therefore there would not  be  the
    financial support available to look after his British child.  It  would
    not be reasonable in those circumstances to expect the child to  follow
    his Vietnamese mother  and  give  up  the  advantages  of  his  British
    citizenship.

16. It has been said that the Judge erred by saying that  "there  would  be
    absolutely no prospect of the Appellant ever being able  to  come  back
    and this family reunited here". Whilst I agree  that  the  use  of  the
    words "absolutely no prospect" may be categorised as over  stating  the
    case, this is only when they are taken in isolation. A full reading  of
    the decision leads me to the  conclusion  that  the  Judge  was  simply
    trying to emphasise the point she was making. The sentence  has  to  be
    read in the full context of the paragraph. When so read, it seems to me
    that the Judge was saying on the evidence before her, that there was no
    realistic prospect of the Appellant's partner  relocating  to  Vietnam,
    finding employment there at a level equivalent to at least �18,600 in a
    country where he doesn't  speak  the  language  and  where  he  has  no
    contacts. Should he  follow  this  course,  then  clearly  it  is  most
    unlikely the family could return to the UK as a family unit because  it
    would be most unlikely that the Appellant would be  able  to  meet  the
    financial requirements of the current rules.

17. In short I do not find the decision contained such error to warrant  it
    being set aside. The findings made by the FtT were ones reasonably open
    to it. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains no error of law
    requiring it to be set aside and remade.

Decision

18. The appeal of the Secretary of State is dismissed. The decision of  the
    First-tier Tribunal allowing A N N P's appeal against the Secretary  of
    State's decision to refuse her leave to remain stands.

19. An anonymity direction has been made, that direction remains.

Direction regarding anonymity - Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules
2008 Rule 14

The appellant is granted anonymity throughout these proceedings, unless  and
until the Tribunal directs otherwise. No report of these  proceedings  shall
directly or indirectly identify her or any  member  of  their  family.  This
direction applies both to the Appellant and to the  Respondent.  Failure  to
comply with this direction could lead to contempt of Court proceedings
