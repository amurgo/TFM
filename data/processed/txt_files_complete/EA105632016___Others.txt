For the Appellant:     Mr P. Nath, Counsel instructed by direct access
                    (Imperium Chambers)
For the Respondent:    Mr N. Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellants are all nationals of  Nigeria  who  assert  a  right  of
    residence in the United Kingdom under Regulation 7 of  the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations  2016  ('the  Regulations').  They
    assert that they are, respectively, the  wife  and  three  minor  step-
    children of a Mr  [NM],  a  French  national  who  is  accepted  to  be
    exercising treaty rights in the United Kingdom

 2. On the eve of the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal there were two
    matters in issue. The first was  whether  the  Appellants  were,  as  a
    matter of law, the 'family members' of Mr [M]: the Respondent  had  not
    accepted that the proxy marriage contracted  between  Mr  [M]  and  the
    first Appellant Mrs [I] was a valid marriage.  The second,  alternative
    issue, was whether the couple were in a 'durable relationship'.

 3. In its determination the First-tier Tribunal (Judge McGrade)  dismissed
    the appeal on all grounds.

 4. The Appellants now have permission to appeal to this Tribunal,  granted
    by Upper Tribunal Judge Hemingway on the 4th March 2019.




    Ground (i): The Proxy Marriage

 5. The Respondent's position at the date of the refusal on the 23rd  March
    2016 was that the purported marriage was not valid. The Appellants  had
    submitted a 'proxy marriage certificate'  issued  in  Nigeria  and  the
    refusal letter explains that this is not regarded as a legal  marriage.
    No reasoning was offered for that conclusion, other than  to  point  to
    the fact that this had been the judgment  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge in December 2013 when an earlier appeal had, on the  same  facts,
    dismissed.

 6. In a witness statement dated the 8th February 2019  the  barrister  who
    appeared for the Appellants before Judge McGrade, a Ms Kareesha Turner,
    describes the events on the morning of the hearing as follows:

         "I appeared against Ms Lecointe. Ms Lecointe was very  helpful  and
         we had a brief discussion out of court so as to narrow the down the
         issues. Ms Lecointe indicated that she  will  be  focusing  on  the
         relationship but that the proxy marriage is not disputed anymore.

         We started the hearing shortly  after  10am  and  as  part  of  the
         preliminary matters, I  mentioned  to  the  Judge  that  the  proxy
         marriage is not being disputed anymore as we (the HOPO and  myself)
         had a discussion outside but also because the position of the  SSHD
         is incorrect with  regards  the  legality  of  proxy  marriages  in
         Nigeria. Judge McGrade asked Ms Lecointe to confirm the position of
         the SSHD who acknowledged in open court  that  the  SSHD  would  no
         longer be disputing the proxy marriage"

 7. This discussion, and Ms Lecointe's concession, is not recorded in Judge
    McGrade's determination. Having recorded the evidence before him,  with
    obvious dissatisfaction, Judge McGrade concluded [at ï¿½10]:

         "The First Appellant  has  produced  what  she  indicated  a  proxy
         marriage certificate.  The obvious difficulty with this certificate
         is that [NM] claims that they were not married  by  proxy,  but  in
         person.  Given one of the parties to  the  alleged  proxy  marriage
         denies being married by proxy, and has given evidence that  he  and
         his wife were married in person in Nigeria, I am unable  to  attach
         any weight to this certificate and to hold that  the  parties  were
         married by proxy or otherwise."

 8. The Appellants now challenge that finding on two grounds. The first  is
    that the First-tier Tribunal impermissibly went behind  the  concession
    made by Ms Lecointe. The second  is  that  as  a  matter  of  law,  the
    Nigerian proxy marriage was in  fact  valid.   As  I  note  above,  the
    refusal letter contained no explanation as to why  this  had  not  been
    accepted, other than the fact that in 2013 a  First-tier  Tribunal  had
    held it to be so. The Tribunal had on that occasion  applied  the  same
    logic as the Upper Tribunal  in  Kareem  (proxy  marriages  -  EU  law)
    Nigeria [2014], logic subsequently held by the Court of  Appeal  to  be
    wrong in Awuku v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017] EWCA
    Civ 178.

 9. For the Secretary of  State  Mr  Bramble  was  unable  to  definitively
    confirm that Ms Lecointe had agreed to 'narrow the issues' as described
    by Ms Turner, since he had  not  been  supplied  with  any  information
    directly from her. He was however able to say that he would not  oppose
    that  particular  head  of  challenge,  since  he  had  before  him  Ms
    Lecointe's note of the hearing, which indicated that she had asked  not
    a single  question  about  the  marriage  in  cross-examination.  This,
    coupled with the fact that Ms Turner is a barrister  who  has  sworn  a
    witness statement, was sufficient evidence to establish that the matter
    had been agreed in the terms she narrates in that statement.   Moreover
    it would appear that  at  no  stage  had  the  Respondent  alleged  the
    marriage to be a marriage  of  convenience.  The  Respondent  therefore
    agreed that this challenge to the First-tier  Tribunal's  findings  was
    made out.




    Ground (ii): Durable Relationship

10. The evidence before the First-tier Tribunal was to the effect that  the
    First Appellant and her children had been living with Mr [M]  for  some
    eight years.   Ms Turner had invited the Tribunal to find that as  well
    as qualifying as 'family members' it must also be  the  case  that  the
    Appellants, in the alternative, qualified as 'extended family  members'
    by virtue of the fact that the two adults in the family had been  in  a
    durable relationship for all of that time.

11. The First-tier Tribunal rejected that proposition in  trenchant  terms,
    identifying what it found to be numerous and serious  discrepancies  in
    the evidence.

12. The Appellants submit that the Tribunal's conclusions about the  nature
    of the relationship was flawed for misunderstanding/  misrepresentation
    of the evidence. It is submitted that the inconsistencies identified in
    the  determination  were  not  inconsistencies   at   all,   but   more
    significantly that the findings made were flawed for a failure to weigh
    all of the relevant evidence in the balance. It is submitted that  that
    the  Tribunal  erred  in  failing  to  assess  the  quality   of   this
    relationship in light of the applicable policies  and  evidence.  There
    was a wealth of evidence to support the  contention  that  this  was  a
    family unit, and none of this evidence is addressed in the decision.

13. Mr Bramble was, once again, in a position where he could not defend the
    determination. He accepted that the file contained a  large  bundle  of
    evidence going to cohabitation and family life, with documents  placing
    the individuals in question in the same  address  for  the  past  eight
    years. He agreed that whatever might be said about  the  discrepancies,
    it was an error for the First-tier Tribunal to fail to consider all  of
    that other evidence in its assessment.

14. Given the lack of findings on the large volume  of  material  evidence,
    the parties invited me to remit this matter to the First-tier Tribunal.
    I agree to do so.




    Decisions

15. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains errors of law and
    it is set aside.

16. The decisions in the appeals will be remade in the First-tier  Tribunal
    by a Judge other than Judge McGrade.

17. There is no order for anonymity.
