      Officer)
For the Respondent:    Mr Howells, Counsel, instructed by NC
      Brothers & Co Solicitors



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. Whereas the  respondent  is  the  appealing  party,  I  shall,  in  the
    interests of convenience and consistency, replicate the nomenclature of
    the decision at first instance.


 2. The appellant, born February 10,  1991  is  a  citizen  of  Nepal.  The
    appellant applied under the Immigration Rules (Appendix FM)  for  entry
    clearance as an adult dependant on November  1,  2012.  The  respondent
    refused her application on January 3, 2013 on the  basis  she  did  not
    meet the Immigration Rules and there were no exceptional  circumstances
    that merited consideration outside of the Rules under article 8 ECHR.

 3. On January 28, 2013 the appellant appealed under Section 82(1)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  arguing  the  application
    should have been allowed under the Immigration Rules  or  alternatively
    under article 8 ECHR. The respondent considered the grounds  of  appeal
    on June 6, 2013 and reiterated that the discretionary guidance relating
    to children of ex Gurkhas did not apply in this case.

 4. The matter was listed before Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  Howard
    (hereinafter referred to  as  "the  FtTJ")  on  July  14,  2014.  In  a
    determination promulgated on August 6, 2014 he allowed the  appellant's
    appeal under article 8 ECHR.

 5. The respondent appealed that decision on August 14,  2014  arguing  the
    FtTJ had erred by  not  following  the  approach  set  out  in  Gulshan
    (Article 8-new rules-correct approach) [2013] UKUT 640.

 6. Permission to appeal was granted by Designated Judge of the  First-tier
    Tribunal French on August 27, 2014 who found the FtTJ  may  have  erred
    by:

      a. Considering article 8 ECHR without any  prior  findings  under  the
         Rules.
      b. Failing to consider whether there were good  arguable  reasons  for
         going beyond the Rules.
      c. By failing to consider concepts such as "compelling  circumstances"
         or "unjustifiable harshness" when considering proportionality

 7. Designated Judge of the First-tier Tribunal French added that there may
    be an issue as to whether the error was material but that  was  not  an
    issue to be decided at the stage permission was given.

 8. No Rule 24 response was filed by respondent.


 9. I was informed the sponsor was in attendance but she did not attend the
    actual hearing.


    SUBMISSIONS ON ERROR IN LAW

10. Mr Whitwell relied on the grounds of appeal  and  submitted  there  had
    been an error in the FtTJ's approach. He sought to expand his  grounds,
    albeit without permission, by drawing to my  attention  errors  in  the
    FtTJ's approach. In particular, he submitted  the  FtTJ  had  erred  in
    suggesting the facts were similar to those  in  Ghising  (Family  life-
    adults-Gurkha policy) [2012] UKUT 160 because in this appeal the person
    settling in the United Kingdom was not a Gurkha but his widow  and  she
    had not been granted status under the HM Forces policy as had been  the
    case in Ghising. The FtTJ had erred in assuming he would  have  settled
    here  because  there  nothing  before  the  FtTJ  that  supported  this
    suggestion. These errors affected the proportionality assessment.

11. Mr Howells submitted the FtTJ did not make any error.  He  argued  that
    the grounds of appeal were limited to whether the FtTJ had erred in his
    approach. He submitted the test in Gulshan was incorrect as it  firstly
    did not reflect the findings  made  by  the  Master  of  the  Rolls  at
    paragraphs [38 to [46] of MF (Nigeria) v the Secretary of State for The
    Home Department [2014] 1WLR 560 or the Court of  Appeal's  observations
    at paragraphs [128] to [131] of MM (Lebanon) & ors [2014] EWCA Civ 985.
    This appeal had only proceeded on the basis of human rights and it  was
    clear the Immigration Rules do not have regard to the policy on Gurkhas
    and the FtTJ was bound to consider the case outside of  the  Rules  and
    his findings were properly set out  in  his  determination.  There  was
    therefore no error and even if his approach had been incorrect  it  was
    not material.

    ASSESSMENT OF ERROR IN LAW

12. At the date of her application the appellant was  almost  21  years  of
    age. Her father had been a Gurkha  soldier  and  her  mother  had  been
    granted leave to settle in New Delhi under  the  Secretary  of  state's
    concession afforded to widows of ex-Gurkhas and not under the HM Forces
    rule. She was eventually granted leave to settle in the United Kingdom.

13. The respondent submitted there were no instructions to Entry  Clearance
    Officers to consider adult children of widows under  any  discretionary
    criteria.

14. At the original hearing no oral evidence was  called  and  the  hearing
    went by way of submissions albeit the FtTJ was provided with  a  bundle
    of documents containing witness  statements  from  the  appellant,  her
    mother and her mother's landlord.  The  FtTJ  had  before  him  various
    documents including the sponsor's bank statements. The sponsor  was  in
    receipt of disability living allowance  (high  rate  for  mobility  and
    middle rate for care) totalling ï¿½444.80 every four  weeks.  Her  income
    matched her outgoings albeit she seemed to spend slightly more than she
    received and as at May 30, 2014 her account was just in credit with  no
    overdraft facility.

15. The FtTJ did not set out the submissions but  Mr  Howells  informed  me
    that it had been conceded at the hearing  that  the  Immigration  Rules
    could not be  met.  I  had  Mr  Howell's  skeleton  argument  and  this
    confirmed it was only an article 8 appeal.

16. The  respondent  was  granted  permission  because  the  FtTJ  had  not
    demonstrated any engagement  with  the  Rules  and  in  particular  the
    requirement that the FtTJ should demonstrate that he  felt  there  were
    circumstances that merited dealing with the case outside of the  Rules.
    The FtTJ did not have regard to the fact the Rules  were  not  met  and
    allowed the appeal based on Mr  Howells's  submissions  concerning  the
    Gurkha policy.

17. The respondent's grounds of appeal were limited and attacked the FtTJ's
    approach rather than his actual findings. Mr Howell has submitted  that
    in the absence of any application to amend the grounds I am confined to
    the grounds submitted. Mr Whitell did not  seek  leave  to  extend  his
    grounds although he did set out the other issues in his submissions.

18. Mr Howells submitted there was no requirement to conduct the two  stage
    approach set out in Gulshan and following the decision in MM  (Lebanon)
    & ors [2014] EWCA Civ 985 I  agree  with  him.  However,  in  order  to
    consider the case outside of the Rules the FtTJ  has  to  be  satisfied
    that there are exceptional and compelling circumstances that would make
    refusal of entry unjustifiably harsh.

19. The  FtTJ  considered  the  evidence  in  the  case  and  gave  reasons
    (unchallenged) for allowing the appeal. He was  satisfied  that  family
    life existed and gave  reasons  for  this  in  paragraph  [13]  of  his
    determination.  He  then  considered  interference  and  whether   such
    interference was necessary before considering  what  the  court  in  MM
    (Lebanon) & ors [2014] EWCA Civ 985 emphasised was necessary  namely  a
    proportionality assessment.

20. Having given his reasons for find there  was  family  life  and  having
    identified this as a Gurkha case (rightly or wrongly) he then  set  out
    why he felt refusing entry was disproportionate including having regard
    to the public interest. The respondent's grounds of appeal were limited
    and if it had been argued more widely then there may well have  been  a
    stronger argument but that was not the position I was faced with.

21. Although I accept that the FtTJ did not set out the law or the  correct
    approach I am satisfied that he found circumstances he viewed  as  both
    exceptional and compelling and that they merited consideration  outside
    of the Rules because refusal would be unjustifiably harsh. Accordingly,
    any error in approach was not material because he  would  have  reached
    the same conclusion in any event.

22. I therefore find there has been no error in law.

    DECISION


23. There is no material error of law and I uphold the original decision.

24. Under Rule 14(1) The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (as
    amended) the  appellant  can  be  granted  anonymity  throughout  these
    proceedings, unless and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise. No
    order has been made and no application  has  been  made  to  alter  the
    position.
