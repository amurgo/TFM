                             DECISION ON APPEAL

Mr H Mohammed (solicitor, Mohammed & Co, Preston) for the appellant
Miss K Prendergast for the respondent

   This is an appeal from a  decision  of  an  adjudicator  (Mr  TR  Jones),
   sitting at Salford on 16 September 2002, dismissing an asylum  and  human
   rights appeal by a homosexual citizen of the Ukraine, who by then was 18.
   Leave was given on the basis of grounds relating to the general situation
   of such persons in that country. The appellant had at  first  asserted  a
   fear of the "Mafia" [Ukrainian rather than Sicilian gangsters]; but  this
   was not pursued before us.

2. One ground which was not in the original ones concerned  the  appellant's
   relationship with Mr Alistair Clarke (ironically  the  draftsman  of  the
   grounds): a homosexual citizen of this country, whom he met in a  Chinese
   restaurant in Manchester. We gave leave to  add  it  (claiming  that  the
   appellant's removal would amount to a disproportionate interference  with
   his family or private life, since that article 8 point had  in  any  case
   been dealt with by the adjudicator.


3. The main complaint in the grounds of appeal is that the  adjudicator  did
   not consider a report entitled 'The situation of gay men and Lesbians  in
   Ukraine'. It is said to be an English  summary  of  a  report  originally
   published there in 2000, in Ukrainian  and  Russian  by  an  organization
   called 'Nash Mir' ['Our World'] in Lugansk. It was sponsored by the Royal
   Netherlands Embassy, and the Soros Foundation, and was referred to before
   us as the 'Soros report', though it does not emanate from  them.  It  was
   before the adjudicator, though rather late in the  day  (sent  in  on  12
   September), and (we were told on instructions from Mr Clarke) referred to
   at the hearing; but he did not mention it when touching on the background
   evidence at � 27.

4.  The  appellant's  own  sexual  history  included,   according   to   the
   adjudicator, "two passing homosexual relationships  in  Ukraine,  meeting
   other men but not residing with them". He was unclear about whether  they
   were legal, and said he had been embarrassed to reveal them at first.  He
   did not tell the adjudicator about any problems he might  have  had  over
   this, rather than from the "Mafia": a statement put before  us  suggested
   that one of the men concerned had blackmailed him to get what he  wanted,
   and that he himself had been beaten up, and got no help from the  police.
   We cannot see why the adjudicator was not told  about  this;  but,  since
   these were transitory relationships, it is  no  more  than  part  of  the
   general picture of life for homosexuals in the Ukraine.

5. Going on to the Soros report,  we  should  say  at  once  that  it  seems
   (especially after we were referred by Miss Prendergast to those  passages
   which do not particularly help the appellant's case) to be  an  admirably
   balanced work. We shall pick out those referred to by  both  sides  which
   seem to be of any serious relevance.

   Page     number     summary

   3  1     "... the opinion that gays and lesbians  should  be  allowed  to
              live as they like, so long as they remain not too visible, is
              most widespread in our modern Ukrainian society. According to
              our own experience, active  homophobia  is  not  widespread":
              mass prosecution, beatings and  blackmail  are  history,  but
              public  displays  of  affection  between  men  are  "all  but
              unthinkable"
   3   2      Attitudes  differ  considerably   between   the   cities   and
              countryside.
   3   3      Officials  are  reluctant  to  acknowledge  the  existence  of
              homosexuals.
   4-5            Former President Leonid Kravchuk regards the  problems  of
              sexual minorities as having a  low  priority  (and  expresses
              personal distaste for their practices)
   5        The  judicial  system  is  weak,  without  enough  human  rights
              expertise: there is no mention of sexual orientation  in  the
              legislation.
   6  1     "Same-sex families" are neither forbidden  nor  acknowledged  by
              the legislation.
      2     Consensual sodomy is not punishable by law: the age  of  consent
              for both heterosexual and homosexual relations  is  the  same
              (16). The current CIPU report at � 6.65 shows the Ukraine was
              the first of the former Soviet republics to legalize  sodomy,
              in 1991.
   7  1     "The overwhelming majority of gays and lesbians has not yet come
              out of the closet" - though at the  same  time  "55%  of  the
              people polled do reveal their sexual orientation -  at  least
              to their  acquaintances  and  friends  who  are  outside  the
              lesbian and gay community"
      2     There is a general atmosphere of distrust  towards  homosexuals,
              but a process of improvement in  society's  attitude  towards
              them  is  clearly  underway:  "fears   concerning   Ukrainian
              society's intolerance towards gays and lesbians are  far  too
              exaggerated".
   8        Many more  respondents  in  the  countryside  had  met  violence
              (14.8%) or blackmail (11.5%) as a result of "coming out" than
              the national average (7.3% in either case)


6. The other source of evidence to which we  were  referred  was  an  e-mail
   sent on 26  February  2003  by  Andriy  Maymulakhin  of  'Our  World'  to
   supporters  in  this  country.  It  refers   to   a   particular   police
   investigation in Dnepropetrovsk, Ukraine of a murder, it would seem of  a
   homosexual, which took place there in the summer of 2002.  The  complaint
   is that police officers, in the course of an investigation which  perhaps
   inevitably was centred on the homosexual community  in  that  city,  used
   psychological pressure, blackmail and other threats, with  some  evidence
   of physical violence. A number of individual case-histories are given.

7. On the article 8 ground, we drew Mr Mohammed's attention  to  the  course
   of action suggested by the Court of Appeal in Amjad Mahmood  [2000]  INLR
   1, and asked him whether the appellant could not return to Kyiv (formerly
   Kiev) and apply in the usual way from there  for  a  visa  to  rejoin  Mr
   Clarke here. Mr Mohammed agreed  that  he  would  be  able  to  do  that.
   Although the two of them might not have  been  living  together  in  this
   country for long enough (two years) to satisfy the  requirements  of  the
   Immigration Rules, we note what is said in Amjad Mahmood  about  such  an
   application not being necessarily bound to succeed for it to be the right
   course; and also about the entry clearance officer on such an application
   himself being bound to give effect to article 8.

8. We do not see any reason in the context of these  two  people's  history,
   dating back to last year, why a temporary separation should be considered
   disproportionate  to  the  legitimate  purpose  under  article   8.2   of
   maintaining an  effective  system  of  immigration  control.  States  are
   entitled, as shown by Amjad Mahmood, to insist on an orderly  process  of
   family, or similar reunions, without  necessarily  giving  preference  to
   those who have contracted relationships in this country  over  those  who
   have to wait, sometimes for  longer  than  they  should,  to  apply  from
   outside.

9. So long as this appellant would face  no  real  risk  on  return  to  the
   Ukraine, which is the main question we have to decide, then we do not see
   why he should not be required to apply from there to rejoin Mr Clarke. We
   do not think, especially in the light of Ullah [2002] EWCA Civ 1856, that
   any potential breach of article 8  in  the  Ukraine  could  prevent  this
   appellant being returned there, since, so long as he faced no  real  risk
   of persecution or article 3 ill-treatment in the  Ukraine,  there  is  no
   reason why he should not pursue his chosen form  of   private  or  family
   life by way of such an application.


10. Refugee Convention/article 3 Human Rights Convention

   We should like to repeat our view that the Soros report, though  prepared
   by a pressure-group, is an exceptionally  well-balanced  piece  of  work,
   which might well put to shame the productions of a number of  well-known,
   and supposedly independent country experts. It  is  clear  from  it  that
   homosexuals still have a number of problems in the Ukraine, especially in
   the countryside. This appellant said in his statement of evidence form he
   had last lived in Rostov on Don, one of the largest cities, and would  be
   returned, if at all, to the capital Kyiv. The investigation practices  of
   the Dnepropetrovsk police are clearly regrettable, though there may  well
   be problems in following up a murder which they seem  at  least  to  have
   suspected had taken place within what public attitudes no  doubt  made  a
   somewhat close community. We were not, however, referred to  anything  in
   the Soros report or elsewhere to show that they are likely to be  typical
   of police attitudes generally in the Ukraine.

11. The picture we do get from the Soros report is of a country where  there
   is no legal discrimination against homosexuals, who wish to  engage  only
   in consensual practices,  but  where  public  attitudes  remain  somewhat
   unreconstructed. This is no doubt  inevitable,  where  legislation  leads
   public opinion, rather than following it: but, just as  in  this  country
   not all that long ago, a process  of  general  enlightenment  is  clearly
   taking place. On the basis of the Soros report, we see  no  present  real
   risk for homosexuals in cities such as Kyiv or Rostov on Don, unless they
   deliberately advertize themselves as such.
