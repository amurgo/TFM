Representation:
For the Appellants:    Ms Johnrose, of Broudie Jackson Canter solicitors

For the Respondent:    Mr Tan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


     1. The Appellants appeal against the decision of First  Tier  Tribunal
        ("FTT")  Judge  A  J  Parker  promulgated  on  26  September  2019.
        Permission to appeal  was  granted  by  FTT  Judge  Shareaf  on  18
        December 2019.


     2. On 30 September 2020 Upper Tribunal Judge Kekic found there was  an
        error of law in the decision of the FTT Judge. She found that there
        were errors of law in relation to the protection claim made by  the
        Appellants and set the judgement aside and adjourned the case for a
        rehearing.

     3. The rehearing of the protection claim came  before  us  on  10  May
        2021.

     4. We were provided  with  a  bundle  totalling  263  pages  from  the
        Appellants. Both Appellants gave live evidence at the  hearing  and
        we were referred to the relevant pages of the bundle.

Background

     5. The Appellants are cousins. They are from Iraq and are  of  Kurdish
        ethnicity from Kirkuk.  They arrived in the UK on 24 September 2018
        and claimed asylum on the basis of the risk of violence  from  non-
        state agents if returned to Iraq.



The law




     6. The law in relation to protection claims and Iraq is  contained  in
        the Country Guidance case  of  SMO,  KSP  and  IM  (Article  15(c);
        Identity Documents) Iraq CG [2019] UK  400  (IAC)  and  AAH  (Iraqi
        Kurds - Internal relocation) CG Iraq [2018] UKUT 212 (IAC). In  SMO
        at section H the UT revisits the Country Guidance at �425:




         425.     We were not asked to revisit  Part  B  of  the  existing
              country guidance, which will remain in place.  As a result  of
              the durable changes in Iraq, however,  the  remainder  of  the
              guidance issued in AA (Iraq) requires significant revision and
              the guidance in BA (Iraq) can no longer stand.  As  we  have
              explained,  the   more   recent   guidance   issued   in AAH
              (Iraq) requires  only  limited  revision,   reflecting   the
              resumption of direct flights to the IKR and  the  introduction
              of the INID, amongst other matters.  The amended guidance,  in
              full, is as follows:


              B.       INDISCRIMINATE VIOLENCE IN IRAQ: ARTICLE 15(C) OF THE
                 QUALIFICATION DIRECTIVE


              30.    There continues to be an internal  armed  conflict  in
                 certain  parts  of  Iraq,  involving  government   forces,
                 various militia and the remnants of ISIL.   Following  the
                 military defeat of  ISIL  at  the  end  of  2017  and  the
                 resulting reduction  in  levels  of  direct  and  indirect
                 violence, however, the intensity of that conflict  is  not
                 such that, as a  general  matter,  there  are  substantial
                 grounds for believing that any civilian returned to  Iraq,
                 solely on account of his presence there, faces a real risk
                 of being subjected to indiscriminate violence amounting to
                 serious harm within the scope of Article 15(c) QD.


              31.    The only exception to the general conclusion above  is
                 in respect of the small mountainous area north of Baiji in
                 Salah al-Din, which is marked on the map at Annex D.  ISIL
                 continues to exercise doctrinal control over that area and
                 the risk of indiscriminate violence there is  such  as  to
                 engage Article 15(c) as a general matter.


              32.    The situation in the  Formerly  Contested  Areas  (the
                 governorates of Anbar, Diyala, Kirkuk, Ninewah  and  Salah
                 Al-Din) is complex, encompassing  ethnic,  political  and
                 humanitarian issues which differ by region.   Whether  the
                 return of an individual to such an area would be  contrary
                 to  Article  15(c)  requires  a  fact-sensitive,  "sliding
                 scale" assessment  to  which  the  following  matters  are
                 relevant.


              33.    Those with an actual or perceived association with ISIL
                 are likely to be at enhanced  risk  throughout  Iraq.   In
                 those areas in which  ISIL  retains  an  active  presence,
                 those who have a current personal association  with  local
                 or national  government  or  the  security  apparatus  are
                 likely to be at enhanced risk.


              34.       The impact of any of the  personal  characteristics
                  listed  immediately  below  must  be  carefully   assessed
                  against the situation in  the  area  to  which  return  is
                  contemplated, with particular reference to the  extent  of
                  ongoing ISIL activity and the behaviour  of  the  security
                  actors in control of that area.  Within the  framework  of
                  such an analysis, the other personal characteristics which
                  are  capable   of   being   relevant,   individually   and
                  cumulatively, to the sliding scale  analysis  required  by
                  Article 15(c) are as follows:


                  �           Opposition to or criticism of the  GOI,  the
                     KRG or local security actors;


                  �           Membership of a national, ethnic or religious
                     group which is either in the minority in the  area  in
                     question, or not in de facto control of that area;


                  �           LGBTI individuals, those not  conforming  to
                     Islamic mores and wealthy or Westernised individuals;


                  �           Humanitarian  or  medical  staff  and  those
                     associated  with  Western  organisations  or  security
                     forces;


                  �           Women and children  without  genuine  family
                     support; and


                  �           Individuals with disabilities.


              35.    The living conditions in Iraq as a whole, including the
                 Formerly Contested Areas, are unlikely to give rise  to  a
                 breach of Article 3 ECHR  or  (therefore)  to  necessitate
                 subsidiary protection under Article 15(b) QD.  Where it is
                 asserted that return to a particular part  of  Iraq  would
                 give rise to such a breach, however, it is to be  recalled
                 that the minimum level of severity required  is  relative,
                 according to the personal circumstances of the  individual
                 concerned.  Any such circumstances require  individualised
                 assessment in the context of the conditions of the area in
                 question.

     7. Therefore, the analysis of this case must be fact specific  as  the
        general situation is not such as to place any individual at risk of
        an Article 3 breach (para 35)  or  engaged  Article  15(c)  of  the
        Qualification Directive (para 31). The  Appellants  do  not  submit
        that they have any of the characteristic outline  in  paragraph  34
        above that might place them at additional risk.


     8. The Appellants in this  case  submit  that  they  are  at  risk  of
        violence from non-state agents, the test for which is contained  in
        R (Bagdanavicius) v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home  Department
        [2005] UKHL 38, [2005] 2 AC 668
             "The plain fact is  that  the  argument  throughout  has  been
             bedevilled by a failure to grasp the distinction in  non-state
             agent cases between on the one hand the risk of  serious  harm
             and on the other  hand  the  risk  of  treatment  contrary  to
             article  3.  In  cases   where   the   risk   'emanates   from
             intentionally inflicted acts of the public authorities in  the
             receiving country' (the language of D v United Kingdom 24 EHRR
             423, 447, para 49) one can use  those  terms  interchangeably:
             the intentionally inflicted acts would without more constitute
             the proscribed treatment. Where, however,  the  risk  emanates
             from non-state bodies, that is not so: any harm  inflicted  by
             non-state agents will not constitute article  3  ill-treatment
             unless in addition the state has failed to provide  reasonable
             protection. If someone is beaten up and seriously injured by a
             criminal gang, the member state  will  not  be  in  breach  of
             article 3 unless it has failed in its positive duty to provide
             reasonable protection against such  criminal  acts.  ...  Non-
             state agents do not subject people to  torture  or  the  other
             proscribed forms  of  ill-treatment,  however  violently  they
             treat  them:  what,  however,  would  transform  such  violent
             treatment into article 3 ill-treatment would  be  the  state's
             failure to provide reasonable protection against it."
     9. In relation to the issue  of  documentation  the  UT  in  SMO  gave
        guidance in relation to the issue of documentation:


             36.    Return of former residents of the Iraqi Kurdish Region
             (IKR) will be to the IKR and  all  other  Iraqis  will  be  to
             Baghdad. The Iraqi authorities will allow  an  Iraqi  national
             (P) in the United Kingdom to  enter  Iraq  only  if  P  is  in
             possession of a current or expired Iraqi passport relating  to
             P, or a Laissez Passer.


             37.    No Iraqi national will be returnable to Baghdad if not
             in possession of one of these documents.


    10. In relation to the CSID documents:


              C.   CIVIL STATUS IDENTITY DOCUMENTATION


              40.    The CSID is being replaced with a new biometric  Iraqi
                 National Identity Card - the INID.  As a  general  matter,
                 it is necessary for an individual to have one of these two
                 documents in order to live and travel within Iraq  without
                 encountering treatment or conditions which are contrary to
                 Article 3 ECHR.   Many of the checkpoints in  the  country
                 are manned by Shia militia who are not controlled  by  the
                 GOI and are unlikely to permit  an  individual  without  a
                 CSID or an INID to pass.  A valid Iraqi  passport  is  not
                 recognised as acceptable proof of  identity  for  internal
                 travel.


              41.    A Laissez Passer will  be  of  no  assistance  in  the
                 absence of a CSID or  an  INID;  it  is  confiscated  upon
                 arrival and is not, in any event,  a  recognised  identity
                 document.  There is insufficient  evidence  to  show  that
                 returnees are issued  with  a  'certification  letter'  at
                 Baghdad Airport, or to show that any such  document  would
                 be recognised internally as acceptable proof of identity.


              42.    Notwithstanding the  phased  transition  to  the  INID
                 within Iraq, replacement CSIDs  remain  available  through
                 Iraqi Consular facilities.  Whether an individual will  be
                 able to obtain a replacement CSID whilst in the UK depends
                 on  the   documents   available   and,   critically,   the
                 availability of the volume and page reference of the entry
                 in the Family Book in  Iraq,  which  system  continues  to
                 underpin the Civil Status  Identity  process.   Given  the
                 importance of that information, most Iraqi  citizens  will
                 recall it. That information  may  also  be  obtained  from
                 family members,  although  it  is  necessary  to  consider
                 whether such relatives are on the father's or the mother's
                 side because the registration system is patrilineal.


              43.    Once in Iraq, it remains the case that an individual is
                 expected to attend their local  CSA  office  in  order  to
                 obtain a replacement document.  All CSA offices  have  now
                 re-opened, although the extent to which records have  been
                 destroyed by the conflict with ISIL  is  unclear,  and  is
                 likely to vary significantly depending on the  extent  and
                 intensity of the conflict in the area in question.


              44.    An individual returnee who is not from Baghdad is  not
                 likely to be able to obtain a replacement document  there,
                 and certainly not within a reasonable time.   Neither  the
                 Central Archive nor the assistance facilities for IDPs are
                 likely  to   render   documentation   assistance   to   an
                 undocumented returnee.


              45.    The likelihood of  obtaining  a  replacement  identity
                 document by the use of a proxy, whether from the UK or  on
                 return to Iraq, has reduced due to the introduction of the
                 INID system.  In order to obtain an  INID,  an  individual
                 must attend their local CSA  office  in  person  to  enrol
                 their biometrics, including fingerprints and  iris  scans.
                 The  CSA  offices  in  which  INID  terminals  have   been
                 installed are  unlikely  -  as  a  result  of  the  phased
                 replacement of the CSID system - to issue a CSID,  whether
                 to an individual in person or to a proxy.    The  reducing
                 number of CSA offices in which  INID  terminals  have  not
                 been installed will continue to issue CSIDs to individuals
                 and  their  proxies  upon  production  of  the   necessary
                 information.

    11. The issue of whether the Appellants have access to their  passports
        or CSID cards is therefore a live one in this matter.


Evidence


    12. Both Appellants gave live evidence and were  cross-examined.  REO's
        evidence was that he and his cousin  worked  in  a  Shisha  Bar  in
        Kirkuk. On 20 July 2018 the manager of the Shisha bar was shot  and
        killed outside the bar where both men were working.  They  did  not
        witness the actual shooting as they were inside the bar but saw the
        aftermath of the murder of the manager of the bar.

    13. It was said that the owner was killed by 'mafia' who were linked to
        the Kurdish PUK party. The First Appellant's evidence was that as a
        result of the incident and subsequent  threats  to  their  families
        both Appellants decided to leave Kirkuk and live with relatives  in
        the village of Hanjira about 10 days after the killing.

    14. They then obtained passports and left Iraq on 18  August  2018  for
        Turkey using an agent  to  help  them  obtain  safe  passage.  From
        Turkey, where they stayed for about 7 days, they travelled  to  the
        UK finally arriving by  plane  on  24  September  2018  where  they
        claimed asylum.

    15. In relation to their identity  documents  the  REO  said  that  his
        passport was given to the agent once they were in  Turkey  and  was
        meant to be returned to his family in Iraq. In relation to his CSID
        Card he said it was in Iraq with his family.

    16. REO said that he had lost all contact with  his  family,  including
        his uncle who had assisted him by providing evidence to be used  in
        this case. He had not had contact with any member of his family for
        a year and had tried to find them on social media without  success.
        He stated that the reason he did not have contact with  his  family
        is in case their phones were taken and contact details were found.

    17. MGO explained the same scenario but that he had given his  passport
        to the agent and left his CSID in Iraq with his family.

    18. One of the issues explored in the hearing  was  the  issue  of  the
        death certificate of the Manager at page 30-31 on  the  bundle.  It
        was accompanied by a copy of the envelope that sent it to  the  UK.
        There is also a report to the Ministry of Interior by  the  Counter
        Terrorism Police in Kirkuk detailing some of the  features  of  the
        car that had  the  killers  in.  There  was  inconsistency  in  the
        evidence as to when the Manager was buried and it was  put  to  the
        Appellants that the death certificate was issued after the date  on
        which the Appellants said they attended the funeral of the Manager.
        MGO explained that the documents had been provided by the family of
        the deceased and said they were genuine.

Discussion

    19. We are prepared to accept that the death certificate and report are
        genuine. However, they do not assist the Appellants. All they  show
        is that the Manager died of severe  bleeding  from  shooting.  They
        also undermine the credibility and chronology of the evidence given
        by the Appellants. In their screening interviews  on  24  September
        2018 both Appellants gave significant detail about what  they  said
        had happened in Iraq. REO in answer to question 80 in the screening
        interview stated that they were taken to the village  by  relatives
        for safety "So from 24th July 2018 to 15th August  2018  we  stayed
        there". MGO stated the same in answer to question 53.

    20. However, both Appellants now maintain  in  witness  statements  and
        oral evidence that they only left for the village 10 days after the
        incident. In their  witness  statements  they  explain  that  their
        family received threats 10 days after the incident and that is  why
        they left Kirkuk. It is unclear which version if  either  is  true.
        The witness statements written in October 2020  give  detail  about
        threats received by the families in the 10-day period which  caused
        them to leave Kirkuk.

    21. The crucial evidence that is lacking is any  credible  evidence  of
        threats to the Appellants themselves from the 'mafia' or any  other
        individuals. Their case at its highest is that being in the back of
        the Shisha bar unable to see what was happening at the  front,  the
        manager whom they worked for was gunned down.  As  a  result,  they
        have been targeted by the same  people  who  killed  him.  However,
        there is no credible evidence of this or any plausible  explanation
        for the threats. The highest it was put in  closing  was  that  the
        threats were from the 'mafia' who it was speculated could have been
        looking for an item or an individual or information.

    22. In HK v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2006] EWCA  Civ
        1037 Neuberger LJ, said, at paragraphs 28 and 29: ?


           "28. Further, in many asylum cases,  some,  even  most,  of  the
           appellant's story may seem inherently unlikely but that does not
           mean that it is untrue. The ingredients  of  a  story,  and  the
           story as a  whole,  have  to  be  considered  against  available
           country  evidence  and  reliable  expert  evidence,  and   other
           familiar factors, such as consistency with  what  the  appellant
           has said before, and with other factual evidence (where there is
           any).

            ?
           29. Inherent probability, which may be helpful in many  domestic
           cases, can be a dangerous, even a wholly  inappropriate,  factor
           to rely on in some asylum cases. Much of the  evidence  will  be
           referable to societies with customs and circumstances which  are
           very different from those of which  the  members  of  the  fact-
           finding tribunal have any (even second-hand) experience.


    23. We have considered the evidence along  with  the  Country  Guidance
        background which shows that Iraq remains  a  state  in  transition,
        where violence  and  lawlessness  are  prevalent.  In  SMO  the  UT
        explains that:


             3.        The situation in the Formerly Contested Areas  (the
             governorates of Anbar, Diyala, Kirkuk, Ninewah and  Salah  Al-
             Din) is  complex,   encompassing   ethnic,   political   and
             humanitarian issues  which  differ  by  region.   Whether  the
             return of an individual to such an area would be  contrary  to
             Article  15(c)  requires  a  fact-sensitive,  "sliding  scale"
             assessment to which the following matters are relevant.


    24. The Appellants explained that their  families  had  allegedly  been
        threatened when they were looked for by the Mafia.  No  details  of
        the threats or any plausible explanation is given as  to  why  they
        were targets or might remain so. The purported threats came with no
        information as to what the mafia were looking for or  whether  they
        would return. However, their evidence of the risk posed to them  is
        simply not credible even applying the lower standard  of  proof  as
        per Tanveer Ahmed.

    25. There is no evidence given about the alleged PUK connection of  the
        perpetrators and no explanation as to why  the  Appellants  thought
        they were associated with the PUK. In any event that  fact  is  not
        relevant as it is not made out that threats were in  fact  made  or
        that the Appellants face violence on return.

    26. Setting the evidence of  the  Appellants  against  that  background
        there is not made out on the evidence that  they  are  at  risk  of
        violence on return to Iraq.

Documentation

    27. In relation to documents available for travel,  in  the  Iraq  CPIN
        June 2020, Annex I: Information obtained  from  the  Home  Office's
        Returns Logistics Department - April 2020, states:


             CSID cards are being phased out and  replaced  by  INID  (Iraq
             National Identification) cards. It is not  currently  possible
             to apply for an INID card outside of Iraq. As  a  result,  the
             Iraqi embassy in London are advising their nationals in the UK
             to apply instead for a 'Registration  Document  (1957)'  which
             they can use to apply for other documents such as passports or
             an INID card once they have returned to Iraq.


             The registration document (1957) must be applied  for  on  the
             applicant's behalf by a nominated representative in  Iraq.  In
             order to  start  the  application,  the  individual  requiring
             documentation would normally provide at least one  copy  of  a
             national identity  document  (see  above  list  Q1,  FAS)  and
             complete a power of attorney (to nominate a representative  in
             Iraq) at the Iraqi  embassy  along  with  the  embassy  issued
             application  forms.  If  they  have  no  copies  of   identity
             documents they also would need to complete a British power  of
             attorney validated by the FCO and provide parents names, place
             and date of birth to their nominated representative in Iraq.


             Once  issued  the  nominated  representative  will  send   the
             registration document (1957) to the applicant in the  UK.  The
             process takes 1-2 months.


             The HO cannot  apply  for  documentation  other  than  Laissez
             Passers on someone's behalf but  the  embassy  is  willing  to
             check to see if the individual  already  holds  documents  and
             provide copies if necessary.


    28. In SMO, KSP & IM (Article 15(c); identity  documents)  (CG) [2019]
        UKUT 400 at [375] the Tribunal in its  analysis  of  the  evidence
        states:

             The Laissez Passer has been a feature of the Iraq CG landscape
             for  years.  In AA  (Iraq),  the  Tribunal  considered   the
             feasibility  of  return  in  some  detail,   which   in   turn
             necessitated consideration of the ways in which an  individual
             might obtain a passport or a Laissez Passer. At that stage, Dr
             Fatah explained that an individual  who  wished  to  obtain  a
             Laissez Passer was required to produce "either a CSID  or  INC
             or a photocopy of a  previous  Iraqi  passport  and  a  police
             report noting that it had been lost or stolen is  required  in
             order to obtain a Laissez-passer". Further enquires made by Dr
             Fatah with the Iraqi Consulate in London suggest that this  is
             no longer the case, and that an individual must simply be able
             to establish their nationality in order to  obtain  a  Laissez
             Passer. In the absence of documentation, an Iraqi national can
             request family members in Iraq to  present  documents  to  the
             Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs  to  prove   the   individual's
             nationality or, failing that, "legal procedures will  then  be
             started to prove the Iraqi nationality of  the  failed  asylum
             seeker through a list of questions in relation to  their  life
             in Iraq". These details are checked against Iraqi records, and
             once verified the individual will be issued  with  a  document
             enabling the individual to return to Iraq. Dr Fatah goes on to
             state in his report that the website of the Iraqi Ministry  of
             Foreign Affairs states that the resulting  document  is  valid
             for six months and that it 'permits a single entry into Iraq'.

    29. The issue in this case is whether the Appellants could have  access
        to either their CSID cards or passports. If they do not then it was
        submitted that AAH (Iraqi Kurds) Iraq  CG [2018]  UKUT  212  (IAC)
        explains that it is not possible for them to  internally  relocate,
        AAH at 13:


             "13.   The position today is that the KRG and the GoI remained
             locked in territorial dispute over areas in Ninewa, Salahadin,
             Diyala and particularly in Kirkuk. To summarise the  situation
             in these disputed territories Dr  Fatah  adopts  the  language
             used by the United States' Institute of  Peace,  stating  that
             they are characterised by a "tangled web of administrative and
             security arrangements between the  Iraqi  government  and  the
             Kurdish regional authorities  that  sit  atop  poorly  defined
             internal boundaries and amid a toxic legacy of mistrust".  The
             international community have, for the most part, condemned the
             independence  referendum  as  destabilising  and  unnecessary.
             Turkey  and  Iran,  neighbouring  countries  with  significant
             Kurdish populations, have expressed alarm. Both  the  GoI  and
             the KRG are attempting to shore up their respective  positions
             by claiming territory, and populations, as  either  inherently
             'Arab'  or  'Kurdish'.  For  example,  the  Yezidi  community,
             largely abandoned in the face of the ISIL onslaught,  are  now
             embraced by Erbil as "Kurdish brothers", the implication being
             that lands formerly occupied by  this  minority  around  Mount
             Sinjar should fall within the IKR. Similar disputes are played
             out in Kirkuk, long the  scene  of  demographic  manipulations
             such as the  "Arabisation"  programme  under  Saddam  Hussain.
             These factors continue to have  significant  implications  for
             civilians on the ground: Kurds from Kirkuk  are  for  instance
             free to come and go within the IKR as they are  considered  by
             Erbil to be residents, but they are not  permitted  to  switch
             their place of formal registration  from  Kirkuk  to  anywhere
             else in the territory, since to do so would be to diminish the
             official Kurdish population in that disputed  city.  There  is
             also substantial disagreement between the two governments over
             the export of, and revenue from, oil. All observers agree that
             the future  is  uncertain  and  that  the  security  situation
             remains precarious. Dr Fatah considers that the greatest  risk
             is found in  those  governates  with  mixed  populations:  the
             general rule of thumb is that the bigger the majority  of  one
             group over another, the more stable the security situation."


    30. We were also referred to  the  CPIN  2020  at  7.2  and  7.2.5.  as
        evidence that internal relocation is not possible for  undocumented
        migrants if returned to Baghdad.


    31. On their own evidence the CSID cards are with their families and it
        may be the case that their passports have also been returned. It is
        therefore a question of whether they have in fact lost contact with
        their families such that they cannot obtain the documents.


    32. The Appellants' evidence was that they were in contact  with  their
        uncle who assisted them in this case but  have  now  lost  contact.
        They remained in contact for significant time whilst in the UK  but
        no evidence of further threats to the families  in  that  time  has
        been provided. They say they have been unable to  find  any  family
        members on social media. There is no evidence of  efforts  made  to
        contact their families or to obtain travel documents through  them.
        That could have been by post, email, phone,  social  media  or  any
        other method. However, there is no  evidence  of  any  attempts  to
        locate their families. It is therefore not made out that they  have
        lost contact with their families.

    33. In our judgement the evidence of loss of contact is  not  credible.
        It coincides too conveniently with their need to be unable  to  get
        travel documents to allow them to stay in the UK. We do not  accept
        that they are unable to contact their families nor has any evidence
        of their attempts to make contact been provided.  It  is  therefore
        not made out that they cannot  access  either  the  CSID  Cards  or
        passports or any other details/information required to enable  them
        to  obtain  the  required  documentation  such  as  a  registration
        document (1957). It is not made out the Appellants  will  not  have
        the support of family members in Iraq to enable them to  return  to
        their home area and continue their lives there.

    34. As a result, their protection claim fails.


Decision

    35. We dismiss the appeal.
