                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State appeals against the decision of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Samina Iqbal sitting at Hatton Cross on 21 March  2016)
    allowing the claimant's appeal against the decision of the Secretary of
    State to refuse to  issue  him  with  a  permanent  residence  card  as
    confirmation of his right to reside in the  United  Kingdom  under  the
    Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations  2006  in  accordance  with  Regulation
    15(1)(f); that is, as a person who has resided in the United Kingdom in
    accordance with the Regulations for a continuous period of five  years;
    and who is, at the end of that period, a family member who has retained
    the right of residence.   The  First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  make  an
    anonymity direction, and I do not consider that the  claimant  requires
    anonymity for these proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

The Relevant Factual Background

 2. The claimant is a national of  Nigeria,  whose  date  of  birth  is  15
    December 1980.  On 8 January 2009 the claimant sought a residence  card
    as the spouse of Kerstin Mertens Riemer (alias Riemer  Kerstin  Mertens
    or Kerstin Riemer), a German national.  The claimant was issued with  a
    five year residence card which was valid until 5 November 2014.

 3. On 17 November  2014  his  solicitors  applied  on  his  behalf  for  a
    permanent residence card.  They enclosed a decree absolute issued on 25
    January 2012 showing that the marriage which he had contracted with  Ms
    Riemer on 21 June 2008 had been dissolved.  As evidence of Ms  Riemer's
    exercise of treaty rights at  the  date  of  divorce,  the  appellant's
    solicitors provided bank statements from Ms Riemer which  only  ran  up
    until 22 July 2011, and two letters from HMRC addressed  to  Ms  Riemer
    dated 17 May 2013 and 21 February 2014 respectively, neither  of  which
    showed that Ms Riemer had been exercising treaty rights at the date  of
    divorce.

 4. On 16 March 2015 the Secretary of State gave her reasons  for  refusing
    the application.  She noted that Ms Riemer's bank statements  ended  on
    22 July 2011.  He had provided two sets of pay  slips  from  Heathfield
    Solutions Limited.  He had provided one set, set  A,  dated  26  August
    2011 to 28 June 2013, and a second set, set B, dated 5  September  2011
    to 5 July 2013.  It was acknowledged that the pay slips  straddled  the
    date of divorce.  But the pay slips indicated payment by cash, and were
    unsupported by bank statements  showing  wages.   Also,  the  two  HMRC
    letters did not record the claimed employment.  In addition, there were
    two internal anomalies in the pay slips.  One of them was that  at  the
    2012 year end, set A pay slip dated 30 March 2012 stated  that  pay  to
    date was �6,000, whilst set B pay slip dated 5 April 2012 said that pay
    to date was �4,000.  The pay slips were therefore found to be irregular
    and inconsistent with legitimately issued pay slips.  So the pay  slips
    from Heathfield Solutions Limited were found to have been produced  for
    his immigration  purposes  alone,  and  were  found  to  be  unreliable
    evidence without weight.

 5. The Secretary of State went  on  to  identify  additional  reasons  for
    reaching the conclusion that the claimant had manipulated  his  and  Ms
    Riemer's employment  to  gain  advantage  by  providing  false  sponsor
    employment pay slips and a false employer's letter.

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 6. For the purposes  of  the  hearing  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  the
    claimant's solicitors compiled a substantial  claimant's  bundle  which
    contained the letter from HMRC addressed to Ms Riemer dated 22 February
    2016.  This letter set out her employment  history.   HMRC  now  had  a
    record of Ms Riemer being employed by Heathfield Solutions  Limited  in
    the tax year ending April 2012, and the tax year ending April 2013.

 7.  In  her  subsequent   decision,   Judge   Iqbal   records   that   the
    representatives agreed at the hearing that the main issue  was  whether
    Ms Riemer was  working  for  the  relevant  period,  and  if  the  HMRC
    documents covered this period.

 8. At paragraph [21], she addressed the allegation that the  claimant  had
    provided false sponsor documents.   She  held  that  this  was  a  bare
    assertion, in respect of which the  respondent  had  not  provided  any
    evidence.  Accordingly, she was not persuaded that the  documents  were
    not genuine.

 9. At paragraph [24], she held that the claimant had attempted to  provide
    evidence to demonstrate each part of his wife's working  life  for  the
    relevant period, but unfortunately his relationship with Ms Riemer  had
    completely broken down such that he was unable to provide  any  further
    documentation.  She found that  the  HMRC  letters  of  2013  and  2014
    confirmed  the  ex-wife's  previous  employment  with  Ordained   Steps
    Limited.

10. At paragraph 27, she addressed the evidence of Ms  Riemer's  employment
    history in the tax year ending  2012,  which  was  the  year  when  the
    marriage was terminated.  She held that the evidence in the HMRC letter
    of 22  February  2016  showed  that  she  was  employed  by  Heathfield
    Solutions Limited, as well as by Gladys Gatfield  and  Michael  Connor,
    during that period.  The evidence certainly demonstrated that  she  was
    lawfully employed during the relevant period; and certainly at the date
    of divorce on 25 January 2012 she  was  in  employment  and  exercising
    treaty rights.

The Grant of Permission to Appeal

11. On 20 September 2016 First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Shimmin  granted  the
    Secretary of State permission to appeal on the grounds it was  arguable
    that the judge had reached a finding in respect of the former  spouse's
    employment which was not supported by the evidence.

The Error of Law Hearing on 19 October 2016

12. At the hearing before me to determine whether an error of law was  made
    out, Mr Bramble took me through the HMRC letters  and  the  pay  slips.
    Having considered this evidence alongside  the  case  advanced  in  the
    refusal letter, I was persuaded that a material error of law  was  made
    out such that the decision should be set aside and re-made.  I gave  my
    reasons for so finding in short form, and my extended reasons  are  set
    out below.

Reasons for Finding an Error of Law

13. The judge failed to engage with all the evidence bearing upon the issue
    of whether the ex-spouse was exercising treaty rights at  the  date  of
    divorce, and she did not engage with the reasoning of the Secretary  of
    State in the refusal letter as to why it could be inferred that the pay
    slips were not genuine.  The judge also failed to give adequate reasons
    for  treating  the  HMRC  letter  of  22  February  2016  as  providing
    conclusive evidence that the ex-spouse had been employed throughout the
    relevant period by Heathfield Solutions Limited.

14. Although the burden of proof rested with  the  Secretary  of  State  to
    prove forgery, the burden rested with the claimant to prove that his ex-
    spouse was exercising treaty rights at the date of  divorce,  and  thus
    that the pay slips from  Heathfield  Solutions  Limited  were  reliable
    evidence of such employment.

15. Moreover, it is not true that the Secretary of State's case  was  based
    on bare assertion.  The fact that the pay slips purportedly  issued  by
    the same employer contained significant anomalies was enough in  itself
    to call into question whether they were genuinely issued, and certainly
    whether they were documents which could be relied  on.   Moreover,  the
    pay slips did not disclose the payment of  any  tax  on  the  sponsor's
    earnings, and so their inherent probative value was much less  than  if
    she was purportedly paying tax on a PAYE basis.

16. There is a clear inconsistency between, on  the  one  hand,  the  judge
    accepting the evidence of the claimant that he was  unable  to  provide
    any further documentation because his relationship with the sponsor had
    completely broken down, but at the same time treating as conclusive the
    HMRC letter of 22 February 2016 which was addressed to Ms  Riemer,  and
    so could only have come into the appellant's recent possession with  Ms
    Riemer's consent and co-operation.  While she had helped  him  in  this
    regard, she had still not produced bank statements after July  2011  to
    show  money  going  into  her  account  consistent  with  her   claimed
    employment with Heathfield Solutions Limited.

17. Moreover, the judge failed to assess the probative value  of  the  most
    recent HMRC letter both in the context of what it actually  showed  and
    also in the context of the earlier HMRC letters.  If the ex-spouse  was
    genuinely employed by Heathfield  Solutions  Limited  at  the  date  of
    divorce, why did HMRC not have a record of such employment in  2013  or
    2014?  Moreover, consistent with the pay slips, the HMRC letter  of  22
    February 2016 showed that no tax had been paid on a PAYE  basis  either
    in the tax year ended April 2012, or in the tax year ended April  2013.
    All that the HMRC letter  showed  was  that  at  some  point  after  21
    February 2014 the same information as was contained in one of  the  two
    sets of pay slips had been provided to HMRC.  There is nothing  in  the
    letter of 22 February 2016 to indicate that HMRC had sought  to  verify
    the ex-spouse's asserted employment history with  Heathfield  Solutions
    Limited.

18. In short, the judge has failed to give  adequate  reasons  for  finding
    that the HMRC letter of 22 February  2016  demonstrates  that  the  ex-
    spouse was employed at the time of divorce.

19. Accordingly, the decision is vitiated by a material error of  law  such
    that it must be set aside and re-made.

The Resumed Hearing on 25 January 2017

20. For the purposes of the resumed hearing to  remake  the  decision,  the
    claimant's solicitors filed additional  documentary  evidence.  In  the
    light of this evidence, Mr Bramble was minded to accept  that  the  ex-
    spouse was in employment at the date of divorce.

Discussion and Findings on Remaking

21. The additional evidence provided  included  a  letter  from  Heathfield
    Solutions Limited dated 23 December 2016. In  response  to  an  enquiry
    from the claimant's solicitors, they confirmed that the  ex-spouse  had
    been employed by them between August 2011 and November 2013 as a member
    of their administrative team.

22. Regulation 16(2) provides that, in the case of a  worker,  confirmation
    of the worker's engagement  from  his  employer  or  a  certificate  of
    employment is "sufficient proof" that the person is a qualified person.


23. Mr Bramble did not submit that this letter might be fraudulent. In  the
    absence of the Secretary of State pursuing a case of fraud based on the
    anomalies in the documentary  evidence  previously  identified  in  the
    refusal letter and also by Mr Bramble at the error of  law  hearing,  I
    find that the employer's letter is sufficient to  plug  the  evidential
    gap identified by me in my error of  law  decision.  The  claimant  has
    discharged the burden of proving on the balance of  probabilities  that
    his ex-spouse was employed by Heathfield Solutions Limited at the  date
    of divorce, and so she was a qualified person when their  marriage  was
    terminated.


Notice of Decision

24. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained an error  of  law  so
    the decision has been set aside and remade, and the following  decision
    has been substituted: the claimant's appeal under the Regulations  2006
    is allowed.
