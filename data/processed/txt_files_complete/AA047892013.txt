For the Respondent:    Mr Melvin, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellant, a national of Sri Lanka, date of birth [ -  ],  appealed
    against the Respondent's decision, dated 8 May 2013, to refuse leave to
    remain  and  to  make  removal  directions  under  Section  10  of  the
    Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, a form IS151A having been served on 15
    April 2013.  The appeal against that decision  came  before  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Warner (the judge) who dismissed the appeal  on  Refugee
    Convention and Article 3 ECHR grounds on or about 4 September 2013.

2.   As a result of other proceedings the matter came before me on  16  June
    2015 when, for reasons given in a decision promulgated on or  about  21
    July 2015, I found that the Original Tribunal decision could not  stand
    because the judge had not provided adequate or sufficient reasoning  to
    sustain the conclusion that  there  was  no  risk  of  proscribed  ill-
    treatment or persecution on a return to  Sri  Lanka.   Accordingly  the
    matter would have to  be  remade.   As  a  result  of  that  hearing  I
    indicated that the findings of fact made  by  the  judge  should  stand
    unless material evidence when remaking the case  tended  to  show  that
    matters of fact had moved on or had changed since 2013: Insofar  as  it
    was pertinent to the assessment of risk on return.

3.   The appeal proceeded and the Appellant gave evidence  and  was  subject
    to extensive cross-examination by Mr Melvin for the Secretary of State.
     On behalf of the Appellant  a  second  bundle  was  provided  for  the
    purposes of the hearing and that included a second witness statement of
    the Appellant, dated 15 June 2015,  a  letter  from  the  International
    Centre for Prevention and Prosecution of Genocide of  5  June  2015,  a
    letter from the Transnational Government of Tamil Eelam dated  28  July
    2015, a letter from an attorney at law Mr P Anton, dated 12 June  2015,
    and correspondence from the Appellant's mother, dated 16 July 2014,  13
    November 2014, 5 June 2015 and 3 July 2015 together  with  translations
    and copies of the envelopes.

4.   The Appellant asserted that his father was still  detained  in  prison,
    as he had been since 2011, and his mother's letters, which  partly  re-
    presented his case, essentially maintained that position.

5.   It was said that the Appellant's  brother  joined  the  LTTE  in  2001.
    Between 2002 and approximately  2006,  with  the  peace  process  being
    ongoing, nevertheless the  Appellant's  brother  being  a  Tamil  Tiger
    fighter had led to adverse interest by the Sri Lankan Army (SLA).   The
    Appellant's sister was detained by the SLA but ultimately released  and
    left Sri Lanka for India where she remains.   The  Appellant's  brother
    was injured and has not been seen since about  2008.   The  Appellant's
    father was arrested in October 2011 for having  made  adverse  comments
    about the authorities in a TV interview with Al-Jazeera.

6.   The Appellant returned to Sri Lanka in November 2011 and shortly  after
    his return was arrested and detained until released  on  payment  of  a
    bribe on 9th February 2013.  The bribe was paid by his mother  but  his
    costs of/or his agent's fees to leave Sri Lanka in March 2013 was  paid
    for  by  an  uncle.   The  Appellant  claimed  that  he  has   attended
    demonstrations and Remembrance Day events in  the  United  Kingdom  and
    that he joined the Transnational Government of Tamil Eelam (TGTE) which
    appears to be a confederation, in various countries around  the  world,
    of Tamil people supporting the principles of nationhood, homeland and a
    right to self-determination.

7.   The TGTE aspires to a separatist political position for the  north  and
    eastern provinces of Sri Lanka.  The London  office  is  based  at  227
    Preston Road, Wembley, Middlesex  HA9  8NF.   It  is  unclear  what  in
    particular the Appellant has been doing for TGTE other than that he has
    volunteered to organise or help with the organisation of several public
    events in the UK in support of the TGTE objectives  to  contributed  to
    the best of his ability to campaign against "the  ongoing  genocide  in
    Sri Lanka" and providing independent investigation against  war  crimes
    committed.  The TGTE is, as the tone of their letter of 28  July  2015,
    opposed to the Sri Lankan government and its objectives.  The Appellant
    has  also  given  written  evidence  for  onward  transmission  to   an
    international NGO called the International Centre  for  Prevention  and
    Prosecution of Genocide (ICPPG).

8.   The ICPPG is based at the same address as the TGTE  and  reported  that
    the Appellant is a person who has been persecuted.

9.   It was said the TGTE became a proscribed organisation in Sri  Lanka  in
    March 2014.  I have not seen whatever was the  evidence  the  Appellant
    which has been sent to the UNHCR OISL Commission.  It is  clear  to  me
    that the ICPPG is a pro-Tamil organisation set up in the UK.  The  TGTE
    letter of 28 July 2015 claimed that the Appellant has not only attended
    almost all of the TGTE public  meetings  but  has  an  active  role  in
    organising events and public demonstrations.   As  to  what  those  may
    have amounted to is not within the evidence before me.

10.  A letter from an attorney Mr P Anton Punethanayagam  MP  does  no  more
    than record at some stage a visit by the Appellant's  mother  informing
    him that the Appellant's father was detained. He advised her to make  a
    complaint to the Human Rights Commission which it seems she did not do.



11.  The Respondent relies on a letter from  Mr  Magarry  of  the  Migration
    Section of the British High Commission in Colombo which: First,  speaks
    of checks carried out upon attorney endorsement documents either in the
    form of letters or credentials, indicating that letters from  attorneys
    confirming the existence of a live court case or  a  warrant  had  been
    checked and some had been found to be  false,  in  that  there  was  no
    arrest warrant;  Secondly, in a limited number of cases the  attorney's
    credibility was open to doubts as a result of discrepancies, in  others
    the attorney's credentials were found to be false and others  were,  if
    they exist, uncontactable.  The Respondent stated:

         "This clearly shows that  the  vast  majority  (86.7%)  of  letters
         provided by Sri Lankan attorneys that  we  have  verified  are  not
         credible.  (This includes 23% attorney's letters, 20%  of  attorney
         credentials, 30% of other documents submitted though attorneys were
         not contactable and 13% of attorney letters were suspicious).

         Where there are no supporting documents  to  verify,  our  findings
         inclined us to be cautious about accepting the  assertions  in  the
         letters  of  Sri  Lankan   attorneys.   Correspondence   from   the
         Appellant's mother of 7 June 2013, 16 July 2014 and  correspondence
         in July 2015 indicates a claim  of  three  monthly  visits  to  the
         Appellant's father in jail.  There is a dearth of information about
         such steps to obtain the father's release or the viability of  four
         years' detention without trial or even being charged.


12.  The problem in relation to Mr Melvin's submission  that  the  detention
    of the Appellant's father is not credible was that the  judge  accepted
    that evidence of continuing detention as at August 2013 and  there  was
    no contrary evidence to that of the Appellant.  The  documents  I  have
    referred to suggest that the Appellant's  father  is  not  detained  or
    could not have been for this period of time without trial.

13.  In the circumstances therefore it did not seem to me it was open to  Mr
    Melvin to go behind the judge's finding on that issue  whatever  doubts
    he or I might have about the matter.  There simply is  no  evidence  to
    contradict the Judge's finding.   I  agree  with  Mr  Melvin  that  the
    Appellant's involvement with the ICPPG is vague  indeed  and  does  not
    explain what might have been the evidence the Appellant provided of, or
    its relevance to, the claims of genocide.

14.   Similarly  the  TGTE  did  not  appear  to  be  an   organisation   of
    significance nor is there evidence of it being penetrated  by  the  Sri
    Lankan Security Services.  I am aware of the Sri Lankan lawyer's letter
    of 18 June 2013 from a  Mr  Thiruarual  Bal,  attorney  at  law,  which
    confirmed that he for a time represented the Appellant at or about  the
    time of his arrest in November 2012.  It is  unclear  from  the  letter
    whether or not having advised that  a  human  rights  claim  should  be
    advanced he did nothing about it for he had no  part  in  securing  the
    release of the Appellant in February 2013.   As far as I can  tell  the
    matters of which he had direct knowledge  must  have  related  back  to
    events in 2011/2012.

15.  In the circumstances  I  was  satisfied  that  there  was  no  contrary
    evidence adduced by the Respondent to raise material doubts  about  the
    judge's finding that the Appellant's father remained  in  jail.   There
    was no issue that the Appellant's father spoke  out  on  Al-Jazeera  TV
    about his missing son.  I do not accept Mr Melvin's view that it  would
    be absurd to uphold the finding two and  a  half  years  ago  when  the
    Appellant was put on notice  that  they  needed  to  show  the  current
    situation in Sri Lanka two years on and had failed to provide  it.   It
    seemed to me that it was always open to the United Kingdom  authorities
    to make enquiries into this  matter  if  they  wish  to  challenge  the
    finding of fact made.  In the light of the case  of  Devaseelan  [2004]
    UKIAT 282 there was not evidence  to  suggest  that  that  picture  has
    materially changed.  It  was  not  of  course  necessary  to  keep  re-
    establishing matters that  were  positively  found  in  favour  of  the
    Appellant.

16.  I have noted that there  has  been  no  substantive  challenge  to  the
    report of Professor Sundara or  to  the  conclusions  on  the  evidence
    provided by Mr Premavasan  or  Miss  Balasingam  who  the  judge  found
    credible witnesses.  Similarly there has been no substantive  challenge
    to the evidence relating to the marks on the Appellant's body  and  the
    likely causes of them.  The judge carefully considered the case  of  GJ
    and in the submissions made to me it was not  essentially  argued  that
    there was even now in the light of more recent case  law  any  material
    change from the position identified in GJ and Others  [2013]  UKUT  319
    (IAC).

17.  It did not seem to me with reference to the GJ risk categories, in  the
    submissions on behalf of the Appellant that the Appellant directly fell
    as claimed within paragraph 356(7) of GJ in that the Appellant's family
    had given evidence to the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation  Commission
    (LLRC) and the Appellant on return would become at real risk of adverse
    attention as a potential or actual war  crimes  witness.   It  was  not
    known what  the Appellant has given evidence on and  it  is  not  known
    what indeed his statement to the TGTE said.

18.  The more likely GJ category was under paragraph 345(7)(a)  whether  the
    Appellant is likely to be perceived as a threat to the integrity of Sri
    Lanka's single state or took  a  position  vis-�-vis  Tamil  separatism
    within the diaspora outside of Sri Lanka.   The  Appellant's  sustained
    period of detention between November 2011 and February 2013 in which it
    was said the Appellant was ill-treated,  fingerprint  details  recorded
    and a photograph taken  therefore  claims  to  be  at  risk  on  return
    irrespective of any sur place activities of which  the  information  is
    very  general  and  unparticularised.   I  note  what  is  said  in  GJ
    concerning the Sri Lankan government's objective of seeking to identify
    those who are working for or would support Tamil separatism.

19.  I note  the  remarks  made  in  MP  and  Others  [2014]  EWCA  Civ  829
    concerning ongoing human rights  concerns  and  those  identified  with
    links to the LTTE albeit it seemed to me  that  the  Appellant's  links
    were at a low level.  If he was regarded as significant in terms of the
    management and organisation of the LTTE it was unlikely he  would  have
    been released on payments of  a  bribe.   The  significance  of  senior
    personnel in the LTTE to  the  Sri  Lankan  government  can  hardly  be
    understated.  Whilst I  accept  that  release  on  payments  of  bribes
    occurred and may still occur in  Sri  Lanka  it  must  be  relevant  to
    consider the true extent or level of interest likely to  arise  in  the
    person sought released:  Either before release or  likely  expectations
    after release of conduct adverse to the Sri  Lankan  authorities.   The
    Appellant's evidence gave little explanation of how the Appellant might
    choose to act on return and/or to what extent he  would  be  unable  to
    carry out the activities he wished for  fear  of  persecution  or  ill-
    treatment.

20.  It was hard to see why  the  Appellant  would  have  been  released  on
    payment of a bribe, if  he  was  of  significance  to  the  Sri  Lankan
    authorities, bearing in mind the length of time they held him for,  the
    scope to elicit evidence from him of his activities and the absence  of
    any attempt to ever prosecute the Appellant.

21.  I apply the low standard of  proof  identified  in  Sivakumaran  [1998]
    ImmAR 147, Ravichandran [1996] ImmAR 97 and Karanakaran [2000] EWCA Civ
    11, and looking at the  evidence  in  the  round  including  background
    evidence relied by the Appellant, recited in the skeleton argument  and
    in the bundle of documents which is extensive.

22.  I find to that  low  standard  of  proof  this  is  a  case  where  the
    Appellant's activities in the United Kingdom whilst  not  determinative
    would be a matter of interest to the Sri Lankan authorities on  return.
    I find the likelihood is that there would be a continuing  interest  in
    the Appellant given his age, ethnicity, the involvement of other family
    members with the LTTE and the continuing detention of  his  father.   I
    attach limited weight to the Appellant's mother's correspondence, which
    is substantially self-serving, written in  response  to  correspondence
    about particular subjects.  I also take  fully  into  account  the  Sri
    Lankan 2014 Human Rights Report which fully set out concerns about  the
    Sri Lankan Government and their approach to perceived  threats  to  the
    Sri Lankan state.  In the light of the findings of  fact  made  by  the
    judge I therefore find to that low standard of proof that it was likely
    that on return, his background would be looked into and then  he  would
    be detained.

23.  Accordingly it seemed to me that on the evidence and  the  findings  of
    fact made by the judge, which are undeniably favourable on  the  issues
    of credibility, that  the  Appellant's  father's  detention  cannot  be
    dismissed as being without credibility. I agreed with  Mr  Melvin  that
    the Appellant either through representation or otherwise has sought  to
    bring himself within the country guidance  in  a  particularly  obvious
    way.  I did not find that the involvement of the Appellant's father  in
    making a complaint to the LLRC by itself  presented  a  danger  on  the
    return of the Appellant to Sri Lanka for that was  an  aspect  that  is
    particularly directed at his father.  I  note  the  Appellant's  mother
    commented about the police insisting that the Appellant's  father  will
    be released when the Appellant is surrendered to them (see  the  letter
    of 5  June  2015).   I  have  some  concerns  that  the  issue  of  the
    Appellant's release following the  payment of a bribe was now  said  to
    be contingent upon reporting conditions which  the  Appellant  has  not
    complied with.  It seemed strange that those matters should  have  been
    raised belatedly (see the  Appellant's  mother's  letter  of  3rd  July
    2015).

24.  In this case therefore the sur place activities do not seem  to  me  of
    themselves to have been likely to have brought  the  Appellant  to  the
    attention of the Sri Lankan  authorities.   Rather  I  find  that  such
    activities outside Sri Lanka on a return would be  a  matter  that  was
    investigated to a degree.  Whilst attendance at demonstrations  by  the
    diaspora alone is not likely to create a real risk or reasonable degree
    of likelihood that a person will attract adverse  attention  on  return
    nevertheless  it  cannot  be  excluded  that  the  combination  of  the
    Appellant's father's activities, his brother's activities, interest  in
    his family generally and those of  the  Appellant  would  generate  the
    likelihood of detention and further investigation.

25.  I find that the Appellant faces the real risk of  ill-treatment,  there
    being no evidence to suggest that the Sri  Lankan  authorities  holding
    detainees or persons in prison generally have improved conditions  such
    as to remove the risk of Article 3 ill-treatment.  In the circumstances
    therefore I find that there is the risk of persecution because  of  the
    Appellant's Tamil  ethnicity,  his  perceived  political  opinion,  his
    activities such as they have been or associations  with  the  LTTE  and
    were the authorities to become aware of his associations with the TGTE,
    would be additional interest in the Appellant's activities.

26.  The Original Tribunal's decision cannot stand.  The following  decision
    is substituted.  The appeal on Refugee Convention and  Article  3  ECHR
    grounds is allowed.
