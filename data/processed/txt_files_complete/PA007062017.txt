For the Appellant:     Mr K Maguire, Advocate, instructed by Karis
Solicitors Ltd, London
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, a citizen of Albania,  appeals  against  a  decision  by
    First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Walters,  promulgated  on  10  April  2017,
    dismissing her appeal against refusal of asylum.

The grounds of appeal to the UT.

 2. The points raised in the grounds appear  in  three  paragraphs  of  the
    application:

    �7 - the judge did not mention the respondent's acceptance that she had
    been subjected to domestic violence by Mr B C;

    �8 - the judge did not assess the appellant's claim to be at risk  from
    her own family;

    �9 - the judge did not consider the claim in  the  context  of  country
    information placed before him about the scale of gender based  violence
    in Albania and the impracticality of  internal  relocation  as  a  lone
    woman starting afresh.

Submissions for appellant.

 3. The decision narrated  the  evidence,  but  failed  to  make  findings,
    although much appeared to be accepted.  No reason was given for finding
    at �34 no risk of being tracked down and harmed by B C or his family in
    Albania.  One discrepancy was mentioned at �36, but  it  was  not  said
    what was made of it.  The appellant's claim of risk from her own family
    was before the FtT in her  witness  statement,  which  she  adopted  in
    evidence, but the judge did not deal with it.  The unreasoned  finding,
    and the omission, together or separately, required a remit for a  fresh
    hearing in the FtT.

Submissions for respondent.

 4. The appellant's submissions sought to add to the grounds,  in  that  �7
    simply says that a matter was not  mentioned,  without  specifying  any
    error.  In any event, the  point  was  not  in  issue,  and  the  judge
    obviously accepted it.  The grounds made no challenge to the conclusion
    that there was no risk from B C and his family,  based  on  absence  of
    reasoning or on anything else.  Reference to  the  evidence  about  the
    attitude of the appellant's own family showed that she said she was not
    welcome, but she did not say she would return to her  family,  and  she
    did not say they would want to track her down  and  ill-treat  her,  or
    would be capable of doing so.  She had advanced no case  of  risk  from
    her family, so that was why the decision did not deal with  it.   There
    had simply been no evidence of risk to the appellant in Albania  either
    from the family of B C, or from her own.

Discussion and conclusions.

 5. Mr Maguire sought to make of the grounds as much as they  might  yield,
    but even if the further points he identified were to be allowed in,  it
    is not shown that the making of the decision of the  FtT  involved  the
    making of any error on a point of law.

 6. The case on risk from B C and his family was as straightforward as  the
    judge found at �34-35: accepting her  main  contentions,  they  had  no
    ongoing interest in her, and there was no real risk of  their  tracking
    her down and harming her, because they had no reason to do so.

 7. The alleged omission to deal with risk from  her  own  family  was  the
    principal trigger for the grant of permission: but on reference to  the
    evidence, the appellant had not raised any such case for the  judge  to
    deal with. He noted at �32 confirmation for the appellant's cousin that
    her family maintained their stance of  disowning  her.   That  did  not
    suggest  risk.   At  best  for  the  appellant,  it  was  relevant   to
    relocation.

 8. Mr Maguire did not seek to add to �9 of  the  grounds.   The  issue  of
    internal relocation is dealt with at �37: the  appellant  is  a  highly
    educated young woman [she has  a  master's  degree,  which  is  also  a
    teaching qualification] who has demonstrated her independence by living
    alone in rented accommodation for 4  years  while  studying  at  Tirana
    University.  That is brief, but adequate; on the  evidence,  any  other
    conclusion would be surprising.

 9. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

10. An anonymity direction was  made  in  the  FtT.   The  matter  was  not
    addressed in the UT, so anonymity has been maintained herein.
