                                 Respondents
                          Determination and Reasons
1. The Appellant is a citizen of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. He
comes from Kosovo. He appeals, with leave, against the determination of an
Adjudicator, Mr Anthony Hughes, dismissing his appeal on asylum and human
rights grounds against the decision of the Respondent on 13th January 2001
to give directions for his removal as an illegal entrant. Before us today
his is represented by Mr Blum, instructed by Lawrence Lupin and the
Respondent is represented by Mr D Buckley. We have heard extensive, and
very helpful, submissions from Mr Blum but have not needed to call on Mr
Buckley.
2. The Appellant's appeal before us is limited to Article 8. Broadly
speaking, the Appellant's claim is that his medical condition is such that
his removal to his home country would be a breach of Article 8 in that it
would be an interference with his private life, which cannot be justified
as proportionate in the circumstances. We remind ourselves of the terms of
s 77(4) of the 1999 Act. That is to say that, in making his case under
Article 8, the Appellant needs to show that his removal was inhibited by
that Article at the date of the decision, now some 18 months ago.
3. The Appellant's history is as follows. He arrived in the United Kingdom
from Kosovo on 1st April 1999. He claimed asylum on arrival. His uncle was,
and so far as we know still is, in this country and the Appellant has said
that the decision to come here was made because he was told that other
members of his family were here already. On arrival, it appears that the
Appellant made some efforts to discover where the other family members were
but, as he says in his statement, as time went on without him discovering
where they were, he became suspicious. About a year had passed before the
Appellant discovered that in fact his mother and other members of his
family had been murdered before he left Kosovo. As a result of discovering
this, the Appellant had a row with his uncle and they are, and have been
ever since, estranged. He felt that his uncle had let him down and indeed
betrayed him. That was as we have said when he had been here about a year.
In his statement, the Appellant says that it was in February 2000.
4. The paragraph of the Appellant's statement recording what happened after
that is by no means easy to understand. The paragraph reads as follows:
"After receiving this information [that is to say, the details of what had
happened to his family] I was very upset. I stopped going to college and
lost interest in eating. I was on medication for nightmares and depression.
I was then moved to alternative accommodation and I was not able to go to
my doctor. My uncle was given exceptional leave to remain in the UK and for
some reason the Social Services decided to split us up. I was 17 at this
time."
That last sentence appears to indicate a date after November 1999, for the
Appellant became 17 on the 11th of that month.
5. However, the other statements are difficult to reconcile with what the
Appellant told Dr Stuart Turner earlier this year and also with other
documents which are before us. Dr Turner's report on this issue is as
follows:
"I asked about any treatment. He told me that when he first came here, he
went to the doctor five or six times. He was given some medication, but
doesn't remember the name. He still sees a doctor. He is taking mirtazapine
(this is an anti-depressant drug)."
6. There is a letter relating to his referral to a doctor dated a few days
after he had arrived. That letter says that the Appellant has a stomach
problem which was being treated in Kosovo, but has not been treated since
the family left the country.
7. Further, there is a letter dated 22nd November 2000, that is many months
after the Appellant discovered about his family's fate, and that letter
appears to be written in the context of the Appellant's first attempts to
enter college. There appears to be no evidence other than the Appellant's
rather confused paragraph in his statement relating to medication for
nightmares and depression at the relevant time or at any stage immediately
after the Appellant discovered about his family.
8. The phrase "I stopped going to college" related to February 2000 is very
difficult indeed to understand. "I lost interest in eating" is easy to
understand, but it is difficult to know at this stage what that meant.
9. Following the refusal of the Appellant's claim, he was served with a One-
Stop Notice in which he was invited to say whether there were, apart from
his asylum claim, any matters that he relied upon in making his appeal. The
One-Stop Notice was issued on the Appellant's behalf by his present
solicitors. We would not criticise it for its brevity, but it is notable
that it does not mention Article 8. Further, although the Appellant's
knowledge of his uncle's treachery and his family's fate had by then
occurred some months ago, it is not mentioned in the Notice, even though it
was subsequent to the Appellant's original claim and was exactly the sort
of thing which might have been thought to add weight both to the asylum
claim and to any human rights claim. The position is not that we regard the
solicitors who put in that Notice as in any way negligent, but, so far as
we are concerned, the documents served by the Appellant at around the date
of the decision do not suggest that the Appellant was at that date so ill
that his return would have been a breach of the Convention.
10. Soon after the date of the decision, the Appellant was referred by his
solicitors to Dr Seear, whose report is before us. Dr Seear concluded,
having examined the Appellant, that he was suffering from post-traumatic
stress disorder. He writes as follows:
"In summary, may I with great respect conclude that the Appellant has been
severely traumatised and shows a severe form of anguished PTSD."
11. Amongst other factors in the report, we draw attention to the
following. The doctor particularly noted the feeling of betrayal by the
Appellant's uncle. He attributed the Appellant' condition at the time he
saw him at the end of March 2001 to the way in which the Appellant felt he
had been treated by his uncle. He records that the Appellant found that it
was "Very, very hard for him to survive here". Nevertheless, the doctor,
having made his diagnosis, concluded that the Appellant's mental state
would inevitably deteriorate, probably disastrously, if he were to be
returned to the former domicile. As we pointed out to Mr Blum, although we
have a great respect for the doctor's conclusions, it is by no means easy
to see how that conclusion ties in with what the doctor had said about the
Appellant's current state.
12. Some months later, indeed on 23rd November 2001, the Appellant was
referred to Dr Stuart Turner. Dr Stuart Turner is, as we are aware in this
Tribunal, an expert on post-traumatic stress disorder. His conclusion was
that the Appellant was not suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder at
that date. He was instead suffering from major depressive disorder, severe,
as he put it, without psychotic features. Dr Turner based his report and
his diagnosis on a number of factors. He noted that there were pre-
migration and post-migration factors. The pre-migration factors were, as he
put it, a beating followed by failure to return to his family home. The
post-migration factors were learning about the killing of his mother and
other members of his family. The doctor's conclusion on the history was
this:
"In my opinion, the history that he gives is entirely consistent with his
psychiatric state."
Like the Adjudicator, we must have some reservations about the report in
those terms because the Adjudicator found (and this has not been contested)
that the Appellant had not been beaten as he claimed. The doctor's advice
was treatment with drugs and counselling. On the effect of return, Dr
Turner wrote as follows:
"He has a relatively severe depression and, in my opinion, this could
easily get worse in such a situation. He also has fairly frequent suicidal
thoughts. In my opinion, his suicide risk would also increase. At the
moment, my opinion is that there is a need to sort out his treatment regime
and try to improve his mental state. Forcible return would, in my opinion,
lead to deterioration."
13. That is the medical evidence. We have to emphasise that that evidence
all post-dates the date of the decision. Mr Blum points out that the
Appellant's own account is that he was very upset when he discovered about
his uncle's treatment of him and his having hidden the fate of his
relatives. But it is right to say that there is no diagnosis relating
either to that date or to the date of the decision specifically. Dr Seear's
report is the earlier, but Dr Seear discovered in the Appellant a mental
disorder which Dr Turner found was not present when he examined him some
months later. Whether that is because the Appellant's condition has changed
and that he no longer is subject to post-traumatic stress disorder but was,
or whether it is because Dr Seear's diagnosis was one which, although open
to him, was not in fact correct, we do not know.
14. Mr Blum argues that, at the date of the decision, it was
disproportionate to return the Appellant to Kosovo because he would not be
able to obtain proper medical treatment for his condition. In support of
that, Mr Blum has produced not only the municipal profile on Prizren (which
is the Appellant's home area)-that report is dated September 2001-but also
a specific report, produced for the benefit of this Appellant, by James
Korovilas, who has some experience of working in Kosovo. Although he gives
a great deal of information about the situation in Kosovo generally, it is
surprising that he does not say that he has examined either or both of the
diagnoses of the Appellant. He refers specifically to the difficulty of
getting treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder in Kosovo, which might
suggest that he had looked at Dr Seear's report, but it may merely mean
that he was asked what the position would be in respect of a person who had
that condition. Nevertheless, the author of this report specifically states
"There is almost no possibility of the Appellant finding appropriate
medical services in Prizren". We do not know what the author of the report
thought would be appropriate medical services for the Appellant.
15. Nobody doubts that the Appellant has a medical condition which requires
treatment. At the moment, as we understand it, and certainly at the date of
the determination, it was being treated by drugs. As we have said, at the
date of the decision itself there is no credible evidence that it was being
treated, or required treatment. If we were to look at the matter at its
best, the Appellant has a condition which has a varied diagnosis and has
treatment by drugs. If he is returned to Kosovo, he may have to travel to
get treatment. He may have to pay for his drugs. The question is then
whether those factors render his return disproportionate to the aim of
immigration control.
16. We have been, in reaching a conclusion on that, shown two precedents.
One is the case of M (01/TH/03623), heard by the Tribunal in December 2001.
That is a case which, in our view, does not assist this Appellant at all
and indeed it does not assist us in any way to make a conclusion about this
Appellant. The Appellant in M had herself been very badly treated and the
Tribunal regarded the facts of that case as wholly exceptional.
17. Of more relevance is the decision of the European Court of Human Rights
in Bensaid. That decision was notified on 6th February 2001. Bensaid was a
schizophrenic. He had a diagnosis which, we have to say, was very much more
serious than that of the Appellant before us. He had suicidal thoughts.
There was medical evidence indicating that, if he were returned to Algeria
and particularly if he was not able to follow his then current treatment
regime, there would be significant and lasting adverse affect on him.
Nevertheless, the European Court of Human Rights held that his return to
Algeria, despite those factors, was not a breach of either Article 3 or
Article 8. In paragraph 48, the Court noted as follows:
"Nor in the circumstances has it been established that his moral integrity
would be substantially affected to a degree falling within the scope of
Article 8 of the Convention. Even assuming that the dislocation caused to
the Application by removal from the United Kingdom, where he has lived for
the last 11 years, was to be considered by itself as affecting his private
life, in the context of the relationships and support framework which he
enjoyed there, the Court considers that such interference may be regarded
as complying with the requirements of the second paragraph of Article 8,
namely as a measure in accordance with the law."
That demonstrates that not only under the medical aspects of the case, but
under other aspects too, Bensaid's situation was rather stronger than the
present Appellant's. In looking at the medical matters, the Court noted
that the parties had argued firstly, that the Appellant's removal would
deprive him of medical treatment, and that the Government had argued that
his removal was nevertheless proportionate. The Court thought that the
evidence on medical matters did not establish that the Appellant's removal
would breach the Convention. It seems to us that the facts in this case are
sufficiently similar for us simply to say that we follow Bensaid. The fact
that the Appellant may have difficulty in getting treatment, may have to
travel for it, may have to pay for it and the fact that if he does not have
the treatment his condition may conceivably deteriorate, are not matters
which show that his removal would be disproportionate.
18. As we have said, we are grateful to  Mr  Blum  for  taking  us  in  some
detail through the  complex  material  in  this  case.  Our  conclusion  is,
however, that on the basis of the evidence before us, taken as a whole,  the
Appellant has failed to show that the  Appellant's  human  rights  would  be
breached by his removal to his own country. His appeal is dismissed.
