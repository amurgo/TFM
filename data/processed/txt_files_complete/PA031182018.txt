Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms Brakaj, Iris Law Firm
For the Respondent:    Mr Bates, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

        1. The Appellant, a citizen of Iran,  entered  the  United  Kingdom
           illegally, and on 3 August 2007 made a  protection  claim.  That
           claim was refused, and his appeal was dismissed by  decision  of
           Immigration Judge Dennis promulgated on 22 January 2010. In  the
           course of that decision, Judge Dennis rejected as a fiction  the
           Appellant's account of why he had left Iran, his account of  the
           arrest  of  his  father,  and  the  consequential  discovery  of
           political material at the family home. He was found to be of  no
           interest to the authorities.
        2.  Undaunted,  the  Appellant  submitted  a  series   of   further
           representations to the Respondent over the following years which
           were eventually accepted as  amounting  to  a  fresh  protection
           claim, but this too was refused on 8 February 2018.
        3.  The  Appellant's  appeal  against  the  refusal  of  this   new
           protection claim was heard and allowed by  First  Tier  Tribunal
           Judge Gumsley in a decision promulgated on 14  August  2018.  It
           was accepted that the Appellant's sur place act of  acquiring  a
           tattoo whilst living in  the  UK,  of  a  KDPI  emblem,  however
           cynically undertaken, had placed him at real risk of harm as one
           who would be likely  to  be  perceived  as  engaged  in  Kurdish
           political activities, or, a supporter of Kurdish rights.
        4. The Respondent's unduly lengthy and repetitive  application  for
           permission to appeal was granted by First  tier  Tribunal  Judge
           Birrell on 18 September 2018 on the basis the  Judge  had  given
           inadequate reasons for concluding that the  tattoo  in  question
           would come to the attention of the Iranian authorities.
        5. No Rule 24 Notice has been lodged in response to  the  grant  of
           permission to appeal. Neither party has applied pursuant to Rule
           15(2A) for permission to rely upon further evidence.
        6. There is no cross-appeal by the Appellant.
        7. Thus the matter came before me.


      The grant of permission
        8. The grant of permission was made on the  basis  of  the  reasons
           challenge that the Judge who granted  permission  had  distilled
           from what are conceded before me to be extremely poorly  drafted
           grounds; namely  an  arguable  failure  by  the  Judge  to  give
           adequate reasons as to why he had concluded that the Appellant's
           tattoo  would  ever  come  to  the  attention  of  the   Iranian
           authorities.
        9. I should say at  the  outset  that  in  my  judgement  there  is
           absolutely no merit in the complaint identified in the grant  of
           permission. So much was tacitly conceded before me by Mr  Bates'
           decision to decline to advance this complaint  in  argument.  In
           the circumstances I can deal with it briefly.
       10. The Judge accepted that the Appellant's  tattoo,  although  both
           multi-coloured and of significant size, would not be  ordinarily
           visible in the course of daily life because it would  be  hidden
           by his clothing. He accepted that the tattoo comprised an emblem
           of the KDPI, entitled as such with the  letters  KDPI  in  block
           capitals placed below the  emblem.  He  concluded  that  if  the
           tattoo did come to the attention of the Iranian authorities then
           it would be likely to give rise to the perception on their  part
           that the Appellant embraced  both  that  organisation,  and  its
           political aims. Thus it would give rise to an  adverse  interest
           in the Appellant, and indeed the perception of him  as  one  who
           held political views opposed to the Iranian regime,  because  he
           would be perceived to be involved in  Kurdish  politics  and  to
           support the movement for Kurdish rights.
       11. There is no suggestion that these findings were not open to  the
           Judge on the evidence before him. In my judgement they were  not
           only adequately reasoned, but they were entirely consistent with
           the recent country guidance of HB (Kurds) Iran  CG  [2018]  UKUT
           430, albeit that decision was not then available to the Judge.
       12. Those findings therefore raised the issue of how, if at all, the
           Appellant demonstrated the existence of a  real  risk  that  the
           tattoo would come to  the  attention  of  anyone  outside  those
           members  of  his  intimate  family  circle  who  might  see  him
           sufficiently undressed so as to render the tattoo visible, since
           they, being both Kurds and members of his intimate family circle
           might be thought to be unlikely to report the tattoo's existence
           to the Iranian authorities. The Judge posed  and  answered  that
           question, noting that the Appellant had not yet  undertaken  the
           compulsory military service required of adult male  citizens  of
           Iran, and that since there was no  obvious  reason  to  conclude
           that he already held, or, that he  was  entitled  to  obtain,  a
           valid exemption from such military service - there  was  a  real
           risk that upon return to Iran he would be identified as one  who
           was obliged to undertake his military service, and in  addition,
           that he would be compelled to do so.
       13. It is not suggested before me that there is any  error  in  that
           line of reasoning, or, that the  relevant  findings  of  primary
           fact were not open to the Judge upon the  evidence  before  him.
           Indeed when pressed Mr Bates accepted that if the Appellant were
           indeed required to undertake military service that he  would  be
           unable to keep the tattoo in its current form concealed.
       14. In consequence,  the  Judge  correctly  concluded  that  if  the
           Appellant were required to undertake military service  in  Iran,
           he would be unable to keep his tattoo concealed. Not only  would
           it be seen, but the sight of it in that context would bring  him
           to the adverse attention of the Iranian  authorities.  I  reject
           any suggestion that these conclusions are inadequately reasoned.


      The challenge advanced at the hearing
       15. The argument advanced by  Mr  Bates  was  quite  different.  His
           argument rested  upon  the  Judge's  adverse  finding  that  the
           Appellant, although a  Kurd,  had  purchased  and  acquired  the
           tattoo as a cynical act, motivated not  by  any  genuinely  held
           political belief or faithfulness to Kurdish politics, but simply
           in an effort to create a claim to asylum  where  none  otherwise
           existed [45]. Since the tattoo did  not  reflect  any  genuinely
           held political view, it represented no core belief. Thus, it was
           argued, the Appellant could reasonably  be  expected  to  either
           have it removed entirely, or, concealed by  undertaking  further
           tattooing so that it  held  a  form  that  would  no  longer  be
           recognisable as a KDPI  emblem,  and  thus  attract  no  adverse
           attention. No doubt the tattoist's equivalent of turning a sword
           into a ploughshare.
       16. Given the Appellant would attract no adverse  attention  without
           the tattoo in the form that it held at the date of the  hearing,
           and given that the Iranian authorities did not yet know  of  its
           existence, then should his appeal fail, it was argued  that  the
           only sensible inference open to the Judge was that the Appellant
           would be bound to have the  tattoo  removed  or  altered  before
           returning to Iran, so that at the date of his actual  return  he
           would face no risk of harm. Since a tattoo could in principle be
           removed, or, overinked, and thus its appearance was in principle
           capable of a complete change, it was argued that  a  tattoo  did
           not and could not constitute an immutable characteristic of  the
           bearer.
       17. The difficulty with this argument, as the Judge noted,  is  that
           the Respondent had conspicuously failed to offer any evidence to
           discharge any evidential burden that lay upon him  to  establish
           that such steps were possible in relation to this  tattoo.  Even
           if it was a theoretical possibility that this  tattoo  could  be
           removed  or  over-inked,  there  was  no  evidence  as  to  what
           treatment would be required to effect this,  its  cost,  or  its
           duration. Mr Bates accepted that such evidence  was  not  placed
           before the Judge, but he invited me to take the  view  that  the
           Judge ought to have taken judicial notice of the  fact  that  in
           general a tattoo might  be  removed  without  injury  (with  the
           luxury of time and funding), or, that it might  be  successfully
           overinked, so that its original form,  colouring,  and  outlines
           could no longer be discerned so that the viewed could no  longer
           identify the original.
       18. I am not persuaded that this was an  appropriate  approach,  any
           more than  was  the  Judge.  There  was  no  evidence  that  the
           Appellant could afford to  pay  for  any  available  alternative
           works that would successfully remove  or  disguise  the  tattoo.
           There was also no evidence that the Respondent would  delay  his
           removal whilst such works were undertaken. Self  evidently  they
           had not been undertaken at the date of the hearing. Moreover  Mr
           Bates accepted that neither the Tribunal nor the Respondent  had
           any power to force the Appellant to have his tattoo removed, or,
           overinked. Unless voluntarily undertaken by the  Appellant  such
           an act would constitute an assault. Nevertheless he pressed  the
           point that to permit a claimant to succeed in circumstances such
           as this was to simply invite  every  failed  asylum  seeker,  or
           would be refugee without a meritorious claim,  to  make  a  very
           modest investment  in  a  cheap  tattoo  of  some  political  or
           religious symbol (the Appellant had said he paid �80 for his).
       19. In my judgement the answer, as the Judge identified, lay in  the
           Tribunal's obligation to assess the position at the date of  the
           hearing. As at the date of the hearing the Appellant undoubtedly
           bore a tattoo of the emblem identified by the Judge. As Mr Bates
           accepted, there was no error in  his  conclusion  that  if  that
           tattoo came  to  the  attention  of  the  authorities  upon  the
           Appellant's return to Iran it would be likely to give rise to an
           adverse (and potentially extreme) reaction that would give  rise
           to a real risk of harm, sufficient to amount to persecution  and
           a breach of his Article  3  rights.  Thus  he  was  entitled  to
           succeed in his protection appeal.
       20. In my judgement the answer is not to be found in any resort to a
           floodgates argument, but it is to be found (as in  my  judgement
           the Judge clearly recognised) in  the  jurisprudence  concerning
           the proper approach to sur place acts cynically and deliberately
           undertaken  to  found  a  protection  claim  where  none   would
           otherwise exist. Thus, Danian [2000] ImmAr 96, and YB  (Eritrea)
           [2008] EWCA Civ 360, and in particular the comments of SedleyLJ;

                "13.  A  relevant  difference  is  thus  recognised  between
                activities in this country which, while not  necessary,  are
                legitimately pursued by a political dissident against his or
                her own government and may expose him or her to  a  risk  of
                ill-treatment on return, and activities  which  are  pursued
                with the motive not of expressing dissent but of creating or
                aggravating such a risk. But the difference, while relevant,
                is not critical, because all  three  formulations  recognise
                that opportunistic activity sur place is not an  automatic
                bar to asylum. The difficulty is in knowing when the bar can
                eventually come down. To postulate, as in Danian, that  the
                consequence of a finding that the claimant's activity in the
                UK has been entirely opportunistic is that 'his  credibility
                is likely to be low' is, with respect, to beg the  question:
                credibility about what?. He has  ex-hypothesi  already  been
                believed about his activity and (probably) disbelieved about
                his motive. Whether his consequent fear  of  persecution  or
                ill-treatment is well-founded is then an objective question.
                And if it is well-founded, then to disbelieve him when  he
                says it is a  fear  he  now  entertains  may  verge  on  the
                perverse"

       21. Mr Bates confirmed that he sought to advance no  other  argument
           that might be capable of distillation from the grounds.
       22. It follows that in my judgement the  Respondent  has  failed  to
           establish any error of law in the approach taken by the Judge to
           the sur place claim that requires his decision to be  set  aside
           and remade. In consequence I dismiss the appeal.



   DECISION


   The Determination of the First Tier Tribunal which was promulgated on 14
   August 2018 contained no material  error  of  law  in  the  decision  to
   dismiss the Appellant's appeal which requires that decision  to  be  set
   aside and remade, and it is accordingly confirmed.



Direction regarding anonymity - Rule 14 Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)
Rules 2008
      Unless and until the Tribunal  directs  otherwise  the  Appellant  is
        granted anonymity throughout these proceedings. No report of  these
        proceedings  shall  directly  or  indirectly  identify  him.   This
        direction applies both to the  Appellant  and  to  the  Respondent.
        Failure to comply with this direction  could  lead  to  proceedings
        being brought for contempt of court.
