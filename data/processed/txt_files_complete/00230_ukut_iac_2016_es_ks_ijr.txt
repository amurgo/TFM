(i)   The amendment of a judicial review claim form preceding the  lodgement
      of the Acknowledgement of Service does not require the  permission  of
      the Tribunal.  Such permission is required in all other instances.

  ii) In deciding whether to exercise  its  discretionary  power  to  permit
      amendment, the Tribunal will have regard to the overriding  objective,
      fairness,  reasonableness  and  the  public  law  character   of   the
      proceedings.   The  Tribunal  will  also  be  alert  to  any  possible
      subversion or misuse of its processes.

 iii) Every application to amend should be made  formally,  in  writing,  on
      notice to all other parties and paying the appropriate fee which, with
      effect from 21 March 2016, is �255.

  iv) Where an amendment is  permitted  in  the  course  of  a  hearing  the
      Tribunal may, within its discretion, not require compliance  with  the
      aforementioned requirements.

   v) There is a sharp distinction between an application to  amend  grounds
      and an application to amend the Respondent's decision under challenge:

   Applications to Amend: Decision of The Honourable Mr Justice McCloskey,
                                  President


Introduction

(1)   These two cases have been selected for the purpose of giving  guidance
      on the correct approach to be adopted in  applications  to  amend  the
      grounds in judicial review proceedings.

Guidance

   2) The starting point is that the Upper  Tribunal  has  a  discretion  to
      permit judicial review grounds to be amended: see Rule 5 (3)  (c)  and
      Rule 32 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)  Rules  2014.  This
      discretion, in common with every discretion, must be exercised fairly,
      reasonably, taking into account all material factors and giving effect
      to the overriding objective  enshrined  in  rule  2  of  the  Tribunal
      Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008.   In  most  cases  the  main
      question for the Tribunal  will  be  whether  the  proposed  amendment
      discloses an arguable ground.  If yes, it will normally be appropriate
      to permit the amendment.  However, there may be  cases  where  one  or
      more of the considerations enshrined  in  the  concepts  of  fairness,
      reasonableness and  the  overriding  objective  point  to  a  refusal.
      Furthermore, the Tribunal must be satisfied that  its  procedures  are
      not being subverted and that its process is not being  misused.  Thus,
      for example, any pleading of  a  scandalous,  frivolous  or  vexatious
      nature will not  be  permitted.  Any  issue  of  delay  must  also  be
      identified and considered.

   3) The general approach outlined above is consistent with the established
      principle that such amendments as may be required to ensure  that  the
      issues really in  dispute  between  the  parties  secure  adjudication
      should normally be permitted.  This is a well recognised formula found
      in the procedural rules of both courts and tribunals and noted in, for
      example R (P) v Essex County Council  and  Another  [2004]  EWHC  2027
      (Admin), at [35].


   4) The exercise of the discretion to amend should also take into  account
      the public law character of the proceedings.   Thus,  where  relevant,
      one of the factors to be weighed may be the broader importance of  any
      significant issue of law - for example,  an  important  and  recurring
      question of statutory construction - raised by the proposed amendment.



   5) From the moment of initial  lodgement,  the  tribunal  exercises  full
      control over the content of the claim form and grounds. However, it is
      open to an applicant to subsequently lodge  a  claim  form  containing
      amended grounds, serving same on  the  respondent,  without  making  a
      formal  application  for  permission  to  amend,  provided  that  this
      precedes the lodgement of the respondent's Acknowledgement of  Service
      ("AOS").  From this date, the only mechanism for amending the  grounds
      is a formal application to amend the claim form or grounds which  must
      be made formally in writing and paying the appropriate fee.  By virtue
      of the Upper  Tribunal  (Immigration  and  Asylum  Chamber)  (Judicial
      Review) (England and  Wales)  Fees  Order  2011,  the  prescribed  fee
      (formerly �80.00) is �255.00, with effect from 21 March 2016: see  the
      Civil  Proceedings,  Family  Proceedings  and  Upper   Tribunal   Fees
      (Amendment) Order 2016. This is the fee prescribed for applications on
      notice.  This is the appropriate fee because, save as outlined in  [6]
      below, every application to amend the grounds in a claim form must  be
      made on notice to the respondent.



   6) It is appropriate to consider certain other scenarios.  One  is  where
      an order granting permission to apply for judicial review  contains  a
      provision requiring the applicant to amend the  grounds.   In  such  a
      case, the necessary judicial supervision and act  having  occurred,  a
      formal application to amend  is  not  required,  absent  any  judicial
      direction to the contrary.  Another scenario is that of  an  amendment
      approved and ordered by the tribunal in the course of a  hearing,  for
      example an oral renewal hearing  or  a  substantive  hearing.   Unless
      otherwise directed by the Judge, no formal application to  amend  will
      be required in such a case.  However, if such application is directed,
      the appropriate practice will normally be to direct a  without  notice
      application to amend, since the respondent's representations  relating
      to any proposed amendment will usually have been made at the  hearing.
      This is of some  significance,  since  a  without  notice  application
      incurs a substantially  smaller  fee,  namely  �100.   This  does  not
      exclude the possibility that an on notice application  (requiring  the
      higher fee of �255) may be directed in some cases.

   7) It is appropriate to highlight  one  discrete  situation,  namely  the
      effect of an order which grants permission on  limited  grounds  only.
      It is possible for the excluded grounds to be revived, in whole or  in
      part, by a later application to amend.  Where an application  of  this
      kind materialises it will be determined by reference  to  the  general
      principles rehearsed in [2] - [4] above.   Such  an  application  does
      not, in principle, differ from an oral renewal application  consequent
      upon an outright refusal to grant permission  to  apply  for  judicial
      review.  According to the guidance provided  in  R  (Smith)  v  Parole
      Board [2003] 1 WLR 2548, where an application of this species is made,
      there is a broad judicial discretion in deciding whether there is good
      reason to take a different view from the  initial  Judge.   Where  the
      initial judge heard detailed argument, however, it is  suggested  that
      "significant  justification"  would  be  required  before   taking   a
      different view: see [16].  Notably, in  Smith,  there  had  been  some
      three hours of oral argument before the Judge at the permission stage.

   8) There is a sharp distinction between an application to amend a  ground
      or grounds of challenge and an application to amend  the  respondent's
      decision under challenge.  The most detailed treatment of  this  issue
      is found in R (Rathakrishnan)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
      Department [2011] EWHC 1406 (Admin).  The substance of what Ouseley  J
      decided is that where the respondent  has  agreed  to  reconsider  the
      decision under challenge it is not appropriate,  save  in  exceptional
      circumstances, to stay proceedings for judicial review of the original
      decision rather than conclude them.

   9) I consider that this applies a fortiori  in  circumstances  where  the
      respondent has agreed to the quashing of the impugned decision: see  R
      v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home  Department,  ex  parte  Al  Abi
      [Unreported, 1997/WL/1105932].  This is akin to what has become  known
      as the "Salem" principle, considered by this Tribunal  recently  in  R
      (Raza) v Secretary of State for the Home Department (Bail - Conditions
      - Variation - Article 9 ECHR) IJR [2016] UKUT 132 (IAC), at [3] -  [4]
      especially.

  10) It is also appropriate to record what this tribunal said in R  (HN)  v
      Secretary of State for the Home Department (JR - Scope - Evidence) IJR
      [2015] UKUT 437 (IAC), in Chapter (iii) under the rubric  "Application
      to Amend".  It was held, inter alia (per the headnote) :

        i) It is intrinsically undesirable that judicial review proceedings
           be transacted in circumstances where material evidence on  which
           the applicants seek to rely  has  not  been  considered  by  the
           primary decision maker.


       ii) There is a strong general prohibition in contemporary litigation
           against rolling review by the Upper Tribunal in judicial  review
           proceedings.

      iii) Where a judicial review applicant is proposing to  make  further
           representations to the Secretary of State in circumstances where
           a new decision will foreseeably be induced, it will normally  be
           appropriate to refuse permission or to dismiss  the  application
           substantively on the ground that it will be rendered moot and/or
           an alternative remedy remains inexhausted and/or  giving  effect
           to the prohibition against rolling review.

      The last of these three principles  will  bite  on  certain  kinds  of
      applications to amend.  HN was upheld by the Court of Appeal:   see  R
      (on the application of HN and SA) (Afghanistan) v Secretary  of  State
      for the Home Department [2016] EWCA Civ 123.


  11) Finally, judges should be alert  to  the  possibility  that,  in  some
      cases, the respondent may incur costs in consequence of  an  amendment
      being permitted.  This could arise, for example, where  to  permit  an
      amendment results in a hearing date being vacated and/or requires  the
      preparation of a substantially amended pleading.  Thus  the  price  of
      securing an amendment may  sometimes  involve  the  payment  of  costs
      consequently incurred by the respondent.  Of course, in any case where
      the price of permitting an amendment  of  an  applicant's  grounds  is
      likely to be a hearing date being  vacated,  fairness,  reasonableness
      and the overriding objective may combine to  defeat  the  application.
      Every case will be unavoidably fact sensitive.

DECISION

  12) In the first of these two cases [Spahiu] the initial judicial decision
      embodied a refusal of permission to apply for judicial  review  and  a
      refusal to permit amendment of the grounds.  As the  analysis  in  [5]
      above makes clear,  this  latter  aspect  of  the  Judge's  order  was
      superfluous.  The Applicant has now made an application  for  an  oral
      renewal hearing and seeks to rely on  the  proposed  amended  grounds.
      Giving effect to the general rule noted in [5] above, I consider  that
      the Applicant should be permitted to rely on the  additional  grounds.
      They effectively formed part of the application as lodged  since  they
      were added prior to the first judicial adjudication.  Furthermore,  no
      significant issue of delay or prejudice is identifiable.  Finally,  no
      further fee is payable.

  13) In the second application [Salehi] the Applicant, having been  granted
      permission to apply for judicial review, now applies for permission to
      introduce a new ground of challenge.  The Applicant is  challenging  a
      decision of the Secretary of State proposing to remove him to  Hungary
      under the terms of the Dublin Regulation.  Two  comparable  challenges
      in the Administrative Court have been selected and listed together for
      the purpose of giving guidance on returns to Hungary generally.  Other
      cases have been stayed in the meantime.   Given  these  considerations
      and  having  regard  to  the  overriding  objective,  I  consider  the
      appropriate course to  be  to  defer  adjudication  of  the  amendment
      application until the Administrative Court decisions become available.



  14) I would merely add that experience shows that in cases  of  this  kind
      the  advent  of  post-decision  material  and  associated   litigation
      activity,  sometimes  relatively  frenzied,  is   a   not   unfamiliar
      phenomenon: see for example HN and SA.
