                     ERROR OF LAW FINDING AND DIRECTIONS


     1. This is an appeal against a decision of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
        Kelly ('the Judge') promulgated on the 11 March 2016,  following  a
        hearing a Bradford on the 24 February  2016,  in  which  the  Judge
        allowed Mr Mustafa's appeal against the refusal of his  application
        for leave to remain on human rights grounds.
     2. The Judge dismissed the appeal against the refusal of the rejection
        of the protection claim [53] and the refusal of the application for
        ILR made in 2007 [54]. There  is  no  cross  appeal  against  these
        decisions which shall therefore stand.



Background


     3. Mr Mustafa is a citizen of Iraq who was born on the 7 July 1969. He
        entered the United Kingdom  in  July  2000  with  his  partner.  Mr
        Mustafa was convicted of an offence of harassing his partner on  20
        September 2006 for which he received a conditional discharge for  a
        period of two years and was  made  the  subject  of  a  restraining
        order.  On 7 February 2013 Mr Mustafa was convicted of possessing a
        Class B controlled drug for which, on  5  September  2013,  he  was
        sentenced to nine months imprisonment.
     4. On 16 January 2014 the Secretary of  State  decided  to  deport  Mr
        Mustafa. An appeal against the decision to deport  was  allowed  by
        Judge Kelly as 'not being in accordance with the law'. The decision
        was remade and, again,  refused.  The  appeal  against  the  second
        refusal also coming before Judge Kelly.
     5. Permission to appeal Judge Kelly's more recent decision was granted
        to the Secretary of State on Grounds 2-4 of the application but not
        Ground 1 which was refused as the First-tier Judge considering  the
        permission application found that Judge  Kelly's  approach  to  the
        police evidence did not  disclose  an  arguable  legal  error.  The
        Secretary of State challenged the refusal to  grant  permission  on
        Ground 1 which the Upper Tribunal has considered as  a  preliminary
        issue, to enable it to establish  the  Grounds  the  error  of  law
        hearing is to consider.




The Grounds - preliminary issue.



     6. Ground 1 is pleaded as follows:

             "Ground 1 - the Judge's approach to the evidence of DC Laud


             5.   At {�42} the FtJ rejects the evidence  of  DC  Laud  with
                  respect to her witness statement and the  police  evidence
                  relating to the HO's assertion that the A is connected  to
                  organised crime including human  trafficking  {�17}.   The
                  Judge commits a material error in  his  approach  to  this
                  evidence both in failing to assess  it  at  all,  even  if
                  based upon anonymous sources and secondly applying Article
                  6 ECHR.


             6.   It is  clear  from  the  reported  decision  of  Bah  (EO
                  (Turkey) - liability to deport) [2012]  UKUT  00196  (IAC)
                  that this evidence is admissible; must be weighed  in  the
                  balance and, in deportation proceedings, in  not  informed
                  by Article 6 ECHR jurisprudence:


                      53. We  are  not  aware  of  any  authority  for  the
                      proposition that  evidence  which  is  relevant  must
                      nevertheless be excluded if it is hearsay evidence or
                      it is based, directly or indirectly, on evidence from
                      unnamed or  anonymous  sources  or  if  it  leads  to
                      difficulties for the appellant in  dealing  with  it.
                      Mr. Jacobs cannot rely on jurisprudence  relating  to
                      the right of fair trial in Article 6 of the ECHR (see
                      Al-Khawaja and Taheery v United Kingdom  (Application
                      Nos. 26766/05 and 22228/06) (2012) 54 EHRR 23, [2012]
                      Crim L. R. 375) because it is well  established  that
                      deportation   proceedings   are   neither    criminal
                      proceedings nor involve the determination of a  civil
                      right or obligation (Maaouia  v  France  (Application
                      No. 39652/98) (2001) 33 EHRR 42).


                      54. Clearly, these matters affect the  weight  to  be
                      given to such evidence - the greater  the  difficulty
                      in assessing its reliability the less the weight that
                      can properly be given to it. Moreover, whether or not
                      the  proceedings  come  within  Article  6,  in   our
                      judgment, they need  to  meet  minimum  standards  of
                      fairness in order to be in accordance with the law.


                      55. However, both these considerations  are  separate
                      from the admissibility of the evidence. Indeed,  rule
                      51 suggests that the only criteria for  admissibility
                      or otherwise is whether the evidence is relevant  and
                      has been made available to both parties. The question
                      is whether an individual's deportation  is  conducive
                      to the public good. The Tribunal is entitled to  have
                      regard to such evidence before it as is  relevant  to
                      that question, giving such  weight  as  it  considers
                      appropriate  bearing  in  mind  the  quality  of  the
                      evidence and the difficulty in challenging it when it
                      is hearsay evidence or from anonymous sources. We  do
                      not accept that the admission of such evidence  would
                      deny an appellant a fair hearing.


             7.   The  Judge  therefore  materially  erred  in  effectively
                  excluding the evidence for DC Laud and this  has  infected
                  his assessment of the  SSHD's  case  that  deportation  is
                  conducive to the public good in this  case  -  a  decision
                  which,  pursuant  to  section  82  of   the   Nationality,
                  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  (as  amended  by  the
                  Immigration Act 2014) Is not  open  to  him  to  overturn,
                  though it is possible to apply for judicial review against
                  such a decision, which the appellant has not done.


             8.   The Judge has therefore further erred  in  the  reasoning
                  for excluding the DC's evidence"

     7. The relevant paragraphs of the impugned decision [38-42] are in the
        following terms:

             "38.  The  respondent  asserts  (as  paragraph   24   of   the
                  explanatory letter) that the  appellant  "regularly  beat"
                  his wife and that there were three  offences  of  battery,
                  which "were combined into a single charge  of  harassment,
                  with the following Modus Operandi:


                      "During argument MUSTAF punches his wife in the mouth
                      causing her  mouth  to  bleed,  on  another  occasion
                      assaults his wife after an argument  by  banging  her
                      head on the floor then repeatedly punches her in  the
                      stomach causing abdominal injuries requiring hospital
                      treatment.  When discharged  from  hospital  offender
                      slaps  her  across  the  face  causing  her  to  fall
                      unconscious"


             39.   The  above  summary  of  the  circumstances,  supposedly
                  leading  to  the   conviction   of   the   appellant   for
                  "harassment" on the 20th September 2006 is  taken  from  a
                  statement made by one  Detective  Constable  Rachel  Laud,
                  dated  15th  January  2014  [see  enclosure  'J'  in   the
                  respondents bundle of documents].  This in turn appears to
                  have been  taken  from  a  police  report.   However,  the
                  appellant denies having pleaded 'guilty' to  a  charge  of
                  harassment upon anything like this factual basis.  He says
                  the charge arose from his persistent attempts  to  contact
                  his wife.  It is thus necessary to resolve  this  conflict
                  in the evidence.


             40.  I find it to be wholly implausible that  the  prosecution
                  would accept a plea of 'guilty'  to  a  single  charge  of
                  "harassment" if the facts were as claimed by DC Laud.   It
                  is even more implausible that  the  appellant  would  have
                  been conditionally discharged if those had been the facts.
                   Offences of violence  that  result  in  injury  requiring
                  hospital treatment are treated very  seriously  indeed  by
                  the criminal courts, and they usually result in either  an
                  immediate custodial sentence or, at the very least a "high
                  level community order"  [see  the  'Definitive  Guidelines
                  relating to the offence of grievous bodily and actual harm
                  published by the Sentencing Council]. It follows from this
                  that both the charge and sentence  that  was  imposed  are
                  very much more consistent with the appellant's' account of
                  the offence.  Indeed,  it  is  worthy  of  note  that  the
                  appellant was dealt with in such a way that he  no  longer
                  stands convicted of the offence in question  [see  section
                  14 of the Powers of the Criminal Courts  (Sentencing)  Act
                  2000].


             41.  "Further information" about the appellant -  that  he  is
                  supposedly  involved   in   trafficking   people,   drugs,
                  firearms, and illegal cigarettes - is said by the decision
                  maker to have "come to light" after I allowed  his  appeal
                  against the original decision to deport him, made on  16th
                  January 2014 [see paragraphs 17 and 18 of the respondent's
                  decision, served on the 2nd May 2015].  I am bound to  say
                  that I find  this  claim  rather  surprising,  given  that
                  Detective Constable Laud made her statement  on  the  15th
                  January 2014 (i.e. the day before the earlier hearing from
                  which the appeal was allowed) and that she made it at  the
                  request of "the Home Office Immigration Enforcement  Team"
                  due to the appellant "being considered for deportation".


             42.  Be that as it may, if a fraction of the allegations  that
                  are   contained   within   DC   Laud's   statement    were
                  substantiated by evidence, then I would very rapidly  have
                  arrived at the same conclusion as the  respondent;  namely
                  that  the   appellants   deportation   is   overwhelmingly
                  "conducive to the public good".  As it is, there is not  a
                  shred of evidence to support them.  The  statement  of  DC
                  Laud would not be admissible in a court of law.   This  is
                  for good reason.  Its source is anonymous.   Its  veracity
                  and reliability cannot therefore be assessed, and  neither
                  can the possibility be excluded  that  it  is  based  upon
                  nothing more that malicious rumour and gossip.  It  is  no
                  doubt  for  these  reasons   that   reliance   upon   such
                  information  in order to support an allegation of criminal
                  conduct would also fall foul of the fundamental right of a
                  person "to examine and  have  examined  witnesses  against
                  him" [Article 6(3)(d) of the 1950 European Convention  for
                  the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental  Freedoms].
                  Whilst I appreciate I am not concerned  with  evidence  in
                  criminal proceedings, the  idea  that  interference  in  a
                  person's fundamental human  rights  may  be  justified  by
                  "information" of this kind is  one  that  I  suspect  most
                  right-minded people would find truly appalling.   It is  I
                  believe  significant  in  this  context  that  the  entire
                  structure of both Part 13 of  the  Immigration  Rules  and
                  Section 117C of the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum
                  Act 2002 is predicate upon criminal  conduct  having  been
                  proved in a criminal court of law.   I am fortified in  my
                  view of this so called "information" by the fact that  the
                  OASys report (to which the decision maker  fails  to  make
                  reference) assesses the appellant as posing a low risk  of
                  causing serious harm both within  prison  and  within  the
                  community.  I do not therefore attach any weight at all to
                  the statement of DC Laud."

     8. The observation by Judge Kelly that the evidence  from  the  police
        officer  would  not  be  admissible  in  a  court  of  law  is  too
        generalised. This appears to have been one of a number of  findings
        the Judge made in relation to this evidence that suggests the Judge
        may have closed his  mind  to  the  need  to  properly  assess  the
        evidence.  This is relevant for if the  Judge  had  considered  the
        evidence with the required degree of  anxious  scrutiny  and  given
        adequate reasons for the findings made, the weight to be  given  to
        the evidence would be a matter for the Judge.
     9. The Judge makes no reference  to  rule  14(2)(a)  of  the  Tribunal
        Procedure Rules 2014 which allows the First-tier Tribunal to  admit
        evidence whether or not that evidence  would  be  admissible  in  a
        civil trial in the  United  Kingdom.  The  Judge  appears  to  have
        admitted the evidence and so the question of what may have been the
        case elsewhere is arguably irrelevant to the weigh to be  given  to
        the evidence. Similarly the Judge comments upon section 14  of  the
        Criminal Courts Act  without  acknowledging  that  for  immigration
        purposes, such as deportation appeals, convictions can be  referred
        to and do stand as convictions.
    10. The Judge also undermines the weight to  be  given  to  the  police
        evidence by reference to the OASys report.  Mr Chohan was asked  if
        the author of the  report  was  aware  of  this  material  but  the
        chronology shows he could not have been. The OASys report is  dated
        21 November 2013. The police statement is dated  15  January  2014.
        Unless it was shown the author of the OASys report was aware of the
        intelligence the police hold, and this has not been shown to be the
        case, the point made by the Judge can have arguably little merit.
    11. The Judge comments upon the relationship  between  the  information
        relating to the assaults by Mr Mustafa upon  his  partner  and  the
        conviction on a guilty plea to a charge of  harassment.  The  Judge
        does not claim to have been made aware of the facts of the criminal
        case or what developed in relation to the same.  It may  have  been
        that the wife refused to come to court leaving the prosecution with
        little choice other than to accept a lesser charge. The comment the
        conviction is more representative of Mr Mustafa's  version  of  the
        basis of the plea may be arguably correct but this does not mean he
        did not assault his wife  in  the  manner  stated.  The  Judge  has
        arguably speculated beyond the evidence.
    12. In paragraph 41 the Judge comments upon the claim by  the  decision
        maker that the information in the police  officer's  statement  had
        only recently come to light.  The  Judge  provided  no  sustainable
        basis for finding this is not the  case  for  even  if  the  police
        officer's witness statement was prepared at the request of the Home
        Office for use in the deportation proceeding, and may be  dated  15
        January 2014 , this does  not  indicate  when  the  decision  maker
        became aware of the same.
    13. In paragraph 42, of the decision the Judge states  he  attached  no
        weight to the police  evidence.   Such  a  conclusion  is  arguably
        irrational. The Judge may have been entitled to place little weight
        upon the evidence if such a stance could be adequately reasoned but
        dismissing the evidence out of hand illustrates an unwillingness to
        properly consider the evidence.
    14. The comparison of the evidence  to  convictions  is  also  arguably
        wrong. A criminal conviction can only arise if the Crown has proved
        its case beyond reasonable doubt which is a  higher  standard  than
        that applicable in these appeals which is to  the  civil  standard.
        It is possible to accept the evidence in a civil case even if it is
        accepted the higher criminal standard is unlikely to be reached.
    15. This is a material issue for Mr Mustafa's conduct is  an  important
        element of the case. A person who has  acted  as  asserted  in  the
        police statements arguably presents a real risk to the public which
        may be of importance when assessing the weight to be given  to  the
        legitimate aim relied upon by the Secretary of State.
    16. For the above reasons the challenge on Ground  1  is  arguable  and
        permission shall be granted to the Secretary of State to pursue all
        grounds.



Discussion



    17. It was accepted by the advocates that if permission  was  given  to
        the Secretary of State on the pleaded grounds, and for the  reasons
        set out above, the findings in relation to the police evidence  and
        the failure to attach any weight to the same,  means  the  decision
        cannot stand and must be set aside.
    18. As a proper assessment of all the evidence required as part of  the
        Article 8 assessment has not occurred  this  element  cannot  stand
        either.
    19. The decision is set aside.  There shall be no preserved findings in
        respect of the human rights claim. The dismissal of the  appeal  on
        protection grounds and in  relation  to  the  refusal  of  ILR  are
        distinct issues and the findings  in  relation  to  these  elements
        shall be preserved.  This is a case which warrants remittal to  the
        First-tier Tribunal to enable the parties to have a proper  hearing
        of their case.
    20. The following directions shall apply to the  future  management  of
        this appeal:


        DIRECTIONS

          a. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall be set aside.


          b. The appeal shall be remitted for re-hearing to the  First-tier
             Tribunal (IAC) sitting at Manchester on a date and time to  be
             fixed by the Listing Officer at Manchester, taking account  of
             the  operational  requirements  of   that   centre   and   the
             availability of Mr Chohan. Time estimate 2 hours.


          c. The scope of the hearing shall be limited to reconsidering the
             human rights element of the claim only.


          d. The Secretary of State must no later than  28  September  2016
             inform the Resident Judge at Manchester if it is  intended  to
             call the police officer to give  oral  evidence  and,  if  so,
             whether   any   procedural/confidentiality    issues    arise.
             Consideration can then be given to the need for a CMR.


          e. Further directions relating to the provision  of  bundles  for
             the final hearing shall be issued by  the  Manchester  Hearing
             Centre.


          f. No interpreter shall be provided unless specifically requested
             by Mr Mustafa's representatives in which case they must  state
             (a) the language required (b) any  specific  dialect  (c)  the
             reason why an interpreter is needed in light of  Mr  Mustafa's
             clear use and understanding of English.

Decision

    21. The First-tier Tribunal Judge materially erred in law. I set  aside
        the decision of the original Judge. The appeal shall be remitted to
        Manchester for a rehearing of  the  human  rights  element  of  the
        appeal only.


   Anonymity.


    22. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005.


        I make no such order pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal  Procedure
        (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.

Upper Tribunal Judge Hanson
