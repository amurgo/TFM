                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant, Nazima Nazir, was born on 5 January 1992 and is a female
    citizen of Pakistan.  She appealed to the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge
    Batiste) against the decision of the respondent  (the  ECO,  Islamabad)
    dated 12 September 2014 to refuse her  entry  clearance  as  a  partner
    under Appendix FM of HC 395  (as  amended).   The  First-tier  Tribunal
    dismissed her appeal under the Immigration Rules and on Article 8  ECHR
    grounds.  The appellant now appeals,  with  permission,  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 2. It is agreed by the parties that the appellant was unable to  meet  the
    financial requirements of the Immigration Rules.  The appeal before the
    Upper Tribunal concerns Article 8 ECHR only and the First-tier Tribunal
    Judge's analysis of that ground.  The judge wrote at [12 - 15]:

         12.  I have gone on to consider the case outside the Rules as  they
             are not a complete code in this case  given  that  it  is  not
             disputed the appellant  and  sponsor  are  in  a  genuine  and
             subsisting relationship I find  the  refusal  to  grant  entry
             clearance does amount to an interference with the  appellant's
             right to family life.  I also accept that the interference has
             consequences of such gravity as potentially to engage  Article
             8.  Equally I am satisfied that the decision is in  accordance
             with  the  law  and  for  a  legitimate  purpose  namely   the
             maintenance of  proper  immigration  controls  to  secure  the
             economic welfare of the country.  The real  issue  is  whether
             the decision is proportionate.  I have carefully balanced  the
             evidence in this case.

         13.  It is argued  on  the  appellant's  behalf  that  because  the
             sponsor had provided all other evidence  as  to  his  earnings
             being over ï¿½18,600 the weight to be attached to the legitimate
             aim of the Secretary of  State  is  reduced.   I  accept  this
             argument in principle given the public interest for people not
             to be a burden on the taxpayer.  I also  recognise  that  they
             are in a genuine relationship and it is claimed by the sponsor
             that the appellant can speak reasonable English.   In  support
             of this a TOEIC certificate was produced that did  demonstrate
             relatively low achievements in her English language tests.  It
             is clear from these documents that whilst  the  appellant  can
             speak some very limited English, it is at a very basic level.

         14.  However balanced against that is the  fact  that  there  is  a
             method  by  which  the  appellant  could   come   within   the
             Immigration Rules if his claimed income is correct.  It  would
             be simple enough for him to pay his claimed cash  income  from
             his work as a tax driver into his bank account to  enable  the
             requisite bank statements to  be  provided.   In  evidence  he
             accepted that despite the issues in this appeal he  has  still
             not sought to alter his  banking  methods.   As  a  result  he
             accepted that he was still unable to  demonstrate  his  income
             through his bank statements.  It is  surprising  that  he  has
             still not sought to alter his banking methods.

         15.  Given that the Rules are designed to provide a method for  the
             appellant to be allowed entry clearance and it the appellant's
             own decision to follow a  financial  approach  that  means  he
             cannot provide the requisite documents [it is clear  from  the
             context that the judge is speaking of the sponsor here and not
             the appellant]  I  am  satisfied  that  the  decision  of  the
             respondent is proportionate to the legitimate aim  sought.   I
             note the established case law that there is no such thing as a
             'near-miss' when it comes to the Rules.  This case may  amount
             to a near-miss but I  am  satisfied  that  the  decision  with
             regard to the Rules is correct as the requirements of Appendix
             FM-SE are not met and equally I am satisfied that the decision
             is proportionate given that they have not  lived  together  in
             the United Kingdom hitherto and have an established method  to
             demonstrate that they do comply with the Rules.   This  appeal
             is therefore dismissed.

 3. The grounds assert that  the  judge  has  failed  properly  to  analyse
    Article 8 or to make  proper  findings  of  fact  in  relation  to  the
    husband/wife relationship.  The appellant relies on Mostafa (Article  8
    in entry clearance) [2015] UKUT 112 (IAC).  That ground has  no  merit.
    As I have shown from the passage which I have quoted above,  the  judge
    has considered Article 8 and has, indeed, worked his  way  through  the
    established  five-step  process  suggested  in  Razgar  2004  UKHL  27.
    Further, it is difficult to identify other aspects of the  relationship
    between the appellant and the sponsor regarding  which  the  judge  was
    required to make detailed findings  of  fact.   He  accepted  that  the
    relationship was genuine and that the couple have not lived together in
    the United Kingdom hitherto.   I  consider  that  the  judge  has  made
    sufficient findings of fact on which he was able to base his Article  8
    analysis.  Given the factual matrix in this case, Mostafa adds  little.
    Had the judge refrained from making any Article  8  analysis  then  the
    principle set out in Mostafa he may have erred in law by so refraining.
     What is clear about the judge's analysis is that he has  taken  a  dim
    view of the failure of the United Kingdom sponsor to help  himself  and
    the appellant by changing his own financial and banking  procedures  in
    order to comply with the Immigration Rules.  In such circumstances,  it
    is difficult to see why the respondent or the Tribunal should  step  in
    and use Article 8 ECHR to assist an appellant  who,  whilst  she  might
    have taken steps to comply with the Immigration Rules has, for  reasons
    best known to herself and the sponsor, chosen not to do so.  To put  it
    another way, it would be  inappropriate  to  categorise  the  sponsor's
    failure to take the simple steps of changing his  financial  procedures
    as an exceptional circumstance requiring the grant of  leave  to  enter
    under Article 8.  I admit that the judge's assessment of Article  8  is
    brief but it is, on the facts of this case,  adequate  in  my  opinion.
    The judge reached an outcome which was plainly available to him on  the
    evidence and there is nothing said  in  the  grounds  or  in  the  oral
    submissions before the Upper Tribunal which compel  the  setting  aside
    and remaking of this decision.
