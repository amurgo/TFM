For the Appellant:     Mr D Krushner, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

The appellant, a national of Somalia born on 1 January 1937,  appeals,  with
permission, against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  dismissing  her
appeal against the respondent's decision to  refuse  to  issue  her  with  a
permanent residence card under  the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
Regulations 2016 ("the EEA Regulations"), as  the  direct  dependent  family
member of an EEA national who has exercised Treaty rights in the  UK  for  a
continuous period of five years.

The appellant was issued with a family permit on  15  November  2005,  valid
until 15 May 2006 and subsequently with a  residence  card  valid  until  11
December 2011. Following several unsuccessful applications for  a  permanent
residence card, she was issued with a residence  card  on  22  October  2014
valid until 22 January 2019. On 15 December 2017 the appellant  applied  for
a permanent residence card, but her  application  was  refused  on  3  April
2018.

The appellant's application was considered under  regulation  15(1)(b)  with
reference to regulation 7(1)(c) of the 2016 Regulations and was  refused  on
the basis that the respondent was not satisfied that the appellant  was  the
dependent direct family member of her EEA national sponsor,  her  son  [AA].
The respondent considered that the evidence showed that  the  appellant  was
not living with the EEA national sponsor and did not  accept  that  she  was
financially dependent upon him.

The appellant's appeal against that decision was  heard  in  the  First-tier
Tribunal by Judge Easterman on 29 October 2018. The case put  to  the  judge
was that the appellant was staying with the sponsor's sister, her  daughter,
and that the sponsor provided the appellant ï¿½200 a month which  he  gave  in
cash to his sister for their mother's support. The appellant had  previously
lived with the sponsor and had managed to  arrange  for  the  Department  of
Work and Pensions to pay her a pension credit which was  still  being  paid.
The appellant, who was 81 years of age and had mental health  problems,  had
no income other than that provided by the  DWP  and  the  sponsor.  She  had
moved out from the sponsor's house in  2009  when  she  started  to  develop
dementia and went to live with her daughter. Her daughter  was  not  working
and neither was  her  husband.  They  lived  with  their  four  children  in
temporary council accommodation. It was argued on behalf  of  the  appellant
that she was only receiving the pension credit  because  she  was  dependent
upon her son, the sponsor, and that that  should  therefore  be  taken  into
account when assessing dependency.

Judge Easterman was not satisfied, on the  evidence  before  him,  that  the
sponsor was making  a  regular  payment  in  cash  to  his  sister  for  the
appellant's support. He did not accept that the payments from the DWP  could
be counted as demonstrating dependency on the sponsor and he concluded  that
the appellant was dependent on  the  state  and  not  on  the  EEA  national
sponsor. He considered the argument, that the  appellant  was  dependent  on
the sponsor because she received pension credit from the state,  was  wholly
circular. He did not accept the dependency and considered  the  respondent's
decision to be in  accordance  with  the  EEA  Regulations.  He  accordingly
dismissed the appeal.

Permission to appeal that decision was sought and  granted  on  the  grounds
that the judge had arguably erred by finding that the  appellant  could  not
rely upon public funds to show dependency.

At the hearing Mr Krushner relied upon the cases  of  Centre  public  d'aide
sociale de Courcelles v Marie-Christine Lebon  (Free  Movement  of  Persons)
[1987]  EUECJ  R-316/85,  Maria   Frascogna   v   Caisse   des   depots   et
consignations. [1985] EUECJ R-157/84  and  Lim  (EEA  -dependency)  Malaysia
[2013] UKUT 437 in submitting that the appellant's  receipt  of  a  benefit,
namely pension credit, did not prevent her from establishing  dependency  on
the sponsor, when it was because of her dependency  upon  the  sponsor  that
she was able to obtain the benefit in the first  place.  He  submitted  that
the judge had erred by finding otherwise at [25] to [28].

Mr Walker agreed that the judge had materially erred in law in that  respect
and he agreed with the submissions made by Mr Krushner. He agreed  that  the
appellant had demonstrated dependency upon the sponsor and that  the  appeal
ought therefore to be allowed.

In view of Mr Walker's concession, there is no  need  for  me  to  make  any
detailed  findings.  The  evidence,  and  the  caselaw  relied  upon  by  Mr
Krushner, supports the appellant's claim that  she  is  a  dependent  direct
relative, and therefore a family member of her  EEA  national  sponsor,  her
son [AA], for the purposes of regulation 7(1)(c) of  the  2016  Regulations,
and has been so for the relevant period of time such as to  entitle  her  to
permanent residence under the EEA Regulations 2016.  Judge  Easterman  erred
in law in concluding that her receipt  of  pension  credit  disentitled  her
from a finding of dependency and his decision is accordingly set aside.

DECISION

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  involved  the  making
of an error on a point of law. The decision is set aside and is  re-made  by
allowing the appellant's appeal under the EEA Regulations 2016.
