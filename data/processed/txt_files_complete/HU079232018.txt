For the Appellant:     Mr A Govan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms S Rashid, Advocate, instructed by Solacexis,
Solicitors, London


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. Parties are as above, but the rest of this determination refers to them
    as they were in the FtT.

 2. The SSHD has permission to appeal against a decision by FtT Judge Mill,
    promulgated on 12 July 2018, allowing the  appellant's  appeal  against
    deportation.

 3. The main points in the grounds are these:

         "...

         2. ... the FtT found at [26-29 & 31] that the appellant  could  not
         meet  the  requirements  of  the   immigration   rules   to   avoid
         deportation.

         3. ... the FtT erred at [40] by relying on Kaur [2017]  UKUT  00014
         to give considerable weight to the appellant's private  and  family
         life, notwithstanding the operation of section 117B(5) of the  2002
         Act.

         4. ... the FtT at [43] "misapplied" findings of a previous tribunal
         about risk of reoffending,  which  had  to  be  given  weight;  the
         appellant had gone on to offend further and  presented  an  ongoing
         risk.

         5. ... the FtT had found it would  not  be  unduly  harsh  for  the
         appellant's new fiancï¿½e to relocate to Pakistan.

         6. ... there was no basis for the finding at [48] of  low  risk  of
         reoffending; his history showed him to be a persistent offender.

         7.   ...  in  any  event,  rehabilitation  carried  little  weight;
         Olawareju [2018] EWCA Civ 557 at [17].

         8.  The FtT misdirected itself at [50] by  emphasising  factors  of
         little significance in a deportation  case;  NA  (Pakistan)  [2016]
         EWCA Civ 662.

         9. ... the finding at [51] of very significant obstacles to  return
         to Pakistan was speculative, and did  not  justify  a  "near  miss"
         under paragraph 399A of the rules or meet  the  threshold  of  very
         compelling circumstances."

 4. Mr Govan submitted that as the  FtT  found  that  the  requirements  of
    paragraphs 399 and 399A of the rules were not met, and  there  were  no
    very compelling circumstances over and above  those  circumstances,  it
    had no basis on which to allow the appeal. He relied  upon  Hesham  Ali
    [2016] UKSC 60 as well as on NA (Pakistan) and Olawareju.

 5.  Ms  Rashid  relied  upon  her  skeleton  argument  and  made   further
    submissions.  Her key points were these:

      i) No error in referring to Kaur; Rhuppiah [2018] UKSC 58,  which  did
         not involve children, confirmed  the  flexibility  inbuilt  to  the
         concept of  little  weight;  no  error  in  giving  weight  to  the
         appellant's private and family life.

     ii) Detailed consideration and reasoned base for the assessment of  low
         risk of re-offending.

    iii) Public interest appropriately considered by FtT at [41];  Olawareju
         distinguishable - offending from an earlier age and  more  serious;
         the FtT did  follow  the  approach  set  out  in  NA  at  [36];  NA
         distinguishable, as facts therein merited strong public interest in
         deportation, and this appellant's offending not analogous.

     iv) No speculation by FtT about obstacles to integration, as  witnesses
         were all found to be credible and reliable, their  evidence  having
         been tested in cross-examination; conclusion about  proportionality
         open to FtT.

      v) No material error of law; decision evidence based, and within scope
         of discretion.

 6. I reserved my decision.

 7. The inter-relation of  the  scheme  of  the  rules  and  article  8  is
    explained in Hesham Ali, in particular at [37, 38 & 53].

 8. Kaur is a very different case from the present one.  It establishes  no
    principle by which the FtT was entitled to give the appellant's private
    and family life such weight as to avoid deportation.  There is no  such
    principle in Rhuppiah either.

 9. NA is a specimen case of a tribunal going wrong by failing to  approach
    its  decision  through  the  lens  of  the  rules,  making  a  separate
    assessment outside the rules without  appreciating  the  force  of  the
    public  interest,  and  identifying  circumstances   which   were   not
    exceptional, and not rationally capable of meeting the rules.

10. The weight to be given to the public interest is established  not  only
    by the rules but by statute: 2002 Act section 117C(1), the  deportation
    of foreign criminals is in the public interest.

11. Section 117C(2) provides that the more serious the offence, the greater
    the public interest in  deportation,  but  that  does  not  enable  the
    appellant to avoid the principles discussed in NA by distinguishing the
    seriousness of his offending.

12. While each case turns ultimately on its own facts,  it  is  instructive
    that other than as to the  nature  of  the  offending,  NA  at  [51-53]
    discloses circumstances similar to the present case.

13. Olawareju illustrates that risk of reoffending is only one facet of the
    public interest.  That point cannot be washed  away  by  distinguishing
    the facts.  Again, on comparison, that case is like  the  present  one,
    including the absence of a basis for finding very significant obstacles
    to integration.

14. The FtT correctly found at [32] that the appellant  did  not  meet  the
    exceptions within the rules to resist  deportation.   Within  the  same
    sentence the FtT began  to  go  wrong,  embarking  on  "a  freestanding
    article 8 claim outwith the immigration rules".  No such  exercise  was
    open to the FtT.  From  that  point  on,  its  decision  is  hopelessly
    confused.

15. The FtT said at [34] that there had to be very compelling circumstances
    over and above the exceptions in paragraphs 339 and 339A, but  it  went
    on to allow the appeal without identifying any such circumstances.

16. Apart from not speaking "fluent Urdu" the matters discussed by the  FtT
    at [51] are to do with the appellant's life in the UK, not obstacles to
    integration  into  Pakistan.  There  is  nothing  which  justifies  the
    conclusion in the last sentence.

17. Ms Rashid has done her bests to extract any  points  which  might  turn
    matters back in the appellant's favour, but in reality, there are none.

18. Having found that the requirements of paragraphs 399 and  399A  of  the
    rules were not met, and there were  no  very  compelling  circumstances
    over and above those, the only rational  outcome  the  FtT  could  have
    reached, applying the rules and section 117C of the 2002  Act,  was  to
    dismiss the appeal.

19. The decision of the FtT is set aside, and  the  appeal,  as  originally
    brought to it, is dismissed.

20. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
