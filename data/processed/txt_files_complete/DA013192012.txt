Representation:

For the Appellant (Secretary of State): Mr I Jarvis, Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Secretary of State:     Mr R Singer, Counsel, instructed by Nasim &
Co Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS



 1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against  the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal (First-tier Tribunal Judge Fitzgibbon QC and Mr G H
    Getlevog).   For  ease  of   reference,   I   shall   throughout   this
    determination refer to the Secretary of State,  who  was  the  original
    Secretary of State, as "the Secretary of State", to Mr Koufie, who  was
    the original appellant,  as  "the  claimant",  and  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal as "the panel".

 2. The claimant, who is a national of Ghana, was born on 14  August  1975.
    His immigration history is set out  in  the  panel's  determination  at
    paragraph 2, and is as follows.  He entered this country on 23  October
    2000, with a student visa initially valid until 16 October 2000,  which
    was extended by the Secretary of State until 30 January 2004.  He  made
    an application for further leave to remain on the basis of his marriage
    in January 2004 to a British  citizen,  Ms  Sharon  Wilson.   After  an
    initial refusal the Secretary of State granted  this  application,  and
    the claimant was granted leave to remain until 28 February 2008.  Then,
    he made two applications in 2008 for indefinite leave to remain as  the
    spouse of a British citizen, but each application was  refused  because
    he had not paid the fees.  He applied again on  13  December  2010  and
    paid the fees.  This application was refused at the same  time  as  the
    Secretary of State made the decision to  deport  him,  under  paragraph
    322(5) of the Immigration Rules (that is on  the  ground  that  it  was
    undesirable to permit him to remain in the United Kingdom in the  light
    of his character, conduct or associations).

 3. After the claimant (whilst here, as noted by the panel, without  leave)
    had made his application for indefinite leave  to  remain  in  December
    2010, but before the Secretary of State had made  a  decision,  he  was
    sentenced to fifteen months' imprisonment on 12 January 2012 at Teeside
    Crown Court, following a plea of guilty to  an  offence  of  converting
    criminal property (money laundering).  The sentencing  remarks  of  the
    Judge (HH Judge Taylor) are set out at  paragraph  27  of  the  panel's
    determination, as follows:

         "I accept that you are a hardworking young businessman.   You  knew
         none of the other fraudsters in the case.   Your  involvement  came
         about as the result of the involvement with a man...  who  was,  or
         masqueraded as, a solicitor, who should be  standing  in  the  dock
         alongside everyone else except he has escaped  the  jurisdiction...
         You have been involved in legitimate land deals in Africa  and  you
         have been involved with him.  You have pleaded guilty to laundering
         �60,000.  Your difficulty on the face of it is that you,  a  matter
         of weeks before you laundered the �60,000 had an earlier advance of
         �60,000 from the same man.  He had requested the money back  within
         days and you gave the money back, and it is good for you  that  you
         did, but you were suspicious of that.  Within days another  �60,000
         arrives, it goes into your account and I accept  that  you  thought
         some of it was going towards land deal transactions, but from  that
         account money went back out to him and was used  by  you  also.   I
         have already said... that Courts always take a dim  view  of  money
         laundering.  The three of you are lower down the scale."

 4. The panel noted that it was clear from the sentencing remarks that  the
    judge regarded the claimant's offence as a serious one, although he did
    refer to the "courage"  shown  by  those  including  the  claimant  who
    pleaded guilty.

 5. The parole report was  positive,  speaking  of  his  remorse,  and  his
    willingness to take responsibility for his offence, and he was found to
    have a low risk of re-offending.  The claimant  was  also  of  previous
    good character.  Also, although he was on bail for over a  year  before
    he was sentenced, he did not commit any further offences either then or
    during the period since his release from custody (see paragraph  28  of
    the panel's determination).

 6. This was an automatic deportation under Section 32 of  the  UK  Borders
    Act 2007, but the claimant's appeal was  on  the  basis  that  he  came
    within the exception in Section  33(2)(a)  of  the  Act,  in  that  his
    removal in pursuance of the deportation order would breach  his  rights
    under Article 8 of the ECHR.

 7. For reasons  which  will  be  discussed  below,  the  panel  found,  at
    paragraph 45 of its determination, that the claimant  did  come  within
    the exception in Section 33(2)(a) "in that deportation would breach his
    ECHR rights", and the claimant's appeal was accordingly allowed.

 8. The Secretary of State now appeals against  this  decision,  permission
    having been granted by Designated First-tier Tribunal Judge  Murray  on
    20 June 2013.



The Hearing

 9. I heard submissions on behalf of both parties, and was also assisted by
    a skeleton argument which had been carefully prepared by Mr  Singer  on
    behalf of the claimant.  I made a contemporaneous note of the arguments
    advanced before me, which is contained in the  Record  of  Proceedings,
    and so I shall not set out below everything which was said  during  the
    course of the hearing.  However, I have had regard to everything  which
    was said, and to all the documents  contained  within  the  file,  when
    reaching my decision, whether or not the same is specifically  set  out
    below.

10. I should record at the  outset  that  the  arguments  which  were  ably
    advanced on behalf of the Secretary of State by Mr Jarvis were for  the
    most part not contained within the grounds, and  that  Mr  Jarvis  made
    little or no attempt to develop any of the  arguments  which  had  been
    contained in the grounds.  Although Mr Singer had had no advance notice
    of these arguments, and initially expressed his concern that Mr  Jarvis
    was relying on arguments  which  had  not  been  contained  within  the
    grounds, after having heard what these arguments  were,  he  considered
    that he could deal with them, and that if Mr Jarvis on  behalf  of  the
    Secretary of State wished to raise them, he could.

11. In light of this very fair approach taken on behalf of the claimant  by
    Mr Singer, I allowed Mr Jarvis to develop the arguments as he choose.



Secretary of State's Submissions

12. I set out the gist of the Secretary of State's submissions,  as  argued
    before me.  As already noted, the submissions are very  different  from
    those advanced within the grounds.

13. Mr Jarvis agreed with what had been said on the  claimant's  behalf  in
    the skeleton argument prepared by Mr Singer, that the issue boiled down
    to a challenge over proportionality.  This was a  decision  made  under
    Section 32 of the UK Borders Act 2007,  and  at  paragraph  20  of  its
    determination, the panel had found that the claimant did not  meet  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules.  Accordingly, he had to rely  on
    an argument under Article 8 outside the Rules.

14. Under the Rules, even if a person seeking to avoid deportation had been
    sentenced to a period of over a year  in  prison,  he  would  still  be
    permitted to raise Article 8 arguments in reliance on the  interference
    with a relationship, but this  would  only  be  considered  if  he  had
    previously  had  valid  leave  for  fifteen  years.    So   while   the
    Presidential Tribunal in MF (Article 8 - new rules) Nigeria [2012] UKUT
    00393 had decided that there should be  a  two  stage  approach,  being
    first consideration  under  the  Rules  and  then  consideration  under
    Article 8 outside the Rules, that Tribunal had  also  stated  that  the
    Rules were indicative of a ramping  up  of  the  Secretary  of  State's
    position and this had to be taken  into  account.   The  Tribunal  must
    acknowledge the  Secretary  of  State's  position  through  the  Rules,
    although that was not the end of the discussion.

15. When this panel set out the Article 8(2) statutory  argument,  that  is
    the Article 8 argument outside the Rules, it made no reference  to  the
    Secretary of State's policy.

16. In looking at Article 8(2) the panel, in understanding  the  weight  of
    the public interest against the claimant, needed properly to  recognise
    what that pubic interest consisted of, even if  ultimately  it  was  to
    find that the claimant's rights outweighed the public interest in  this
    case.  If the panel did not  properly  appreciate  the  nature  of  the
    public interest, then that was a material error of law.

17. In the Rules,  the  Secretary  of  State  says  that  the  question  of
    interference has no real bearing unless an applicant  had  had  fifteen
    years' valid leave.  That was a strong declaration of what  was  now  a
    relatively  new  executive  policy,  and  for  the  Tribunal   not   to
    acknowledge this later on in the judgment was not properly to recognise
    the nature of the Secretary of State's case.  Although the  new  policy
    would not bind the Tribunal,  it  must  be  weighed  into  the  balance
    properly, otherwise the proportionality exercise had not properly  been
    carried out.

18. Equally, (and this argument also was not contained within the grounds),
    Mr Jarvis's reading of the claimant's immigration history was  that  he
    had been an overstayer from 2008.  The panel in its judgment says  that
    there were no particular immigration history issues (at paragraph  33),
    which must be wrong.  If it was the  case  that  the  claimant  was  an
    overstayer from 2008, and this was not dealt with in the determination,
    then this also was a material error of law.

19. Although the panel noted that the offence was  a  serious  offence  (at
    paragraph 20) what the panel had not done - which was a criticism  made
    generally by the Court of Appeal in SS (Nigeria) [2013]  WLR(D)  192  -
    was to recognise properly that,  in  the  words  used  by  Laws  LJ  at
    paragraph 28 of SS (Nigeria) "the weight to be attached in an Article 8
    case to the state's  policy  of  deporting  foreign  criminals  may  be
    greater where the policy is made, not by the executive government,  but
    by the legislature".  Where referring, as it did in paragraph 31 of the
    determination, to the various previous Court of Appeal  decisions,  the
    panel had not appreciated that these decisions had been made  when  the
    executive's policy on deportation had been expressed solely through the
    Rules.  So when the panel was  relying  on  an  analysis  of  society's
    revulsion towards serious crime, this was on the basis of the policy as
    it then was, rather than as it is now, as laid out by Parliament.

20. What the Court of Appeal was saying in SS (Nigeria) was  that  where  a
    decision was taken on the basis of an express parliamentary declaration
    of social policy, the public interest was not  just  expressed  through
    public or society's revulsion, but by Parliament.  At paragraph  41  of
    SS (Nigeria), decision makers were reminded that when  considering  the
    applicability of Article 8,  a  policy  of  minimal  interference  with
    Parliament's  will  should  be  recognised.   The  public  interest  in
    deporting foreign criminals had  greater  weight  because  it  was  now
    derived from legislation.

21. To this extent, this Tribunal in MF had missed the  point,  because  it
    was not just the importance which the Secretary of  State  attached  to
    the deportation of foreign criminals which had to  be  recognised,  but
    the importance which Parliament attached to this.

22. While it was accepted on behalf of the Secretary of State  that  unless
    and until the decision in MF was overturned, this Tribunal had to adopt
    a two stage approach, the Tribunal must also recognise first  that,  in
    accordance with  the  decision  in  MF,  considerable  weight  must  be
    attached to the executive's view, but also, secondly, as  expressed  in
    SS (Nigeria), even greater weight should be attached to the  importance
    of deporting  foreign  criminals,  because  that  was  what  Parliament
    intended.

23. Even if an applicant relied on Article 8, he  or  she  could  still  be
    deported if his/her sentence was one of twelve months' imprisonment  or
    more.  This was a significant ramping up of the  lawful  expression  of
    the public interest.  So, for example, when the panel  contrasted  this
    offence, where the claimant had received a sentence of imprisonment  of
    a little over a year, with the sentence in RU  (Bangladesh)  where  the
    applicant had  been  in  prison  for  fifteen  years,  it  should  have
    appreciated that under  the  legislative  scheme  now,  the  length  of
    sentence does not have the same role to play as it did then,  when  the
    policy of the executive was a discretionary one expressed  through  the
    Rules.

24. For these reasons, it was argued on behalf of the  Secretary  of  State
    that the  panel  had  not  properly  understood  the  strength  of  the
    Secretary of State's case.



Submissions on behalf of the Claimant

25. Insofar as the Secretary of State intended to rely on the arguments set
    out in the grounds, which had not been developed by Mr  Jarvis  in  his
    submissions, the claimant relied upon the skeleton  argument  which  Mr
    Singer  had  prepared  prior  to  the  hearing.   Essentially,  in  the
    skeleton, it was argued, in reliance on a number of authorities such as
    R (Iran) [2005] EWCA Civ 92 and Miftari v SSHD [2005] EWCA Civ 481 that
    the only basis upon which an error of law could be  found  was  if  the
    panel had failed correctly to apply the relevant  legal  principles  or
    had failed to have regard to the facts before it.

26. Reliance was also placed on the decision in Mukarkar v SSHD [2006] EWCA
    Civ 1045, where it had been noted, at paragraph 30, that "the mere fact
    that one Tribunal had reached what may seem an unusually generous  view
    of the facts of a particular case does not mean that  it  has  made  an
    error of law, so as to justify an appeal under the old  system,  or  an
    order for reconsideration under the new".

27. Insofar as the Secretary of State wished to argue that the decision was
    perverse,  perversity  was  "a  question  which  has   always   to   be
    scrupulously disentangled from the question whether the second decision
    maker simply entertains a strong disagreement with  the  first"  -  see
    Sedley LJ in RP (Zimbabwe) v SSHD [2008] EWCA Civ 825.

28. Even though the Secretary of State had not developed the arguments  set
    out in the grounds, Mr Singer felt he should deal with  them.   Insofar
    as it was suggested that the "seriousness test" had not  properly  been
    considered, clearly the panel had looked at this.  They had had in mind
    the unchallenged evidence from the claimant's wife, who was 54 and  had
    lived in the UK for 40 years since emigrating from Jamaica.  She was  a
    British citizen, and she had an elderly  infirm  mother  for  whom  she
    cared, and a strong bond with her son and grandchild.   The  panel  had
    had in mind that the obstacles to  the  claimant's  wife  leaving  this
    country to go to Ghana where she had never been were so serious  as  to
    be beyond mere hardship, difficulty or obstacle.  Otherwise  the  panel
    would have said so.  As the panel made clear at paragraph 43, this  was
    a case where the consequence of deporting this  claimant  was  that  he
    would  be  separated  from  his  family  in  this  country.   This  was
    accordingly a factor which had to be balanced against  the  factors  in
    favour of his being deported.

29. Insofar as it was now argued on behalf of the Secretary of  State  that
    the panel had given insufficient weight to the claimant having been  an
    overstayer, at paragraph 33, the panel had merely stated that "there is
    no complaint about his immigration history", which  was  correct.   The
    panel did not say he had had a blameless immigration history, far  from
    it, because at paragraph 2 of the determination his immigration history
    had been set out, including the facts that  he  had  made  applications
    which had failed in 2008 and that his application in 2010 had been made
    while he was in this country without leave.  So it was plain  from  the
    determination that the panel was  aware  of  his  immigration  history.
    There was a two year period when the claimant did not  have  leave  and
    did not apply to regularise his position, but the panel  was  aware  of
    this.  Its observation was that the Secretary of State had not made any
    specific complaint with regard to this factor.  Although the claimant's
    immigration history is referred to in the refusal letter it is not even
    relied on in this  letter  as  a  factor  justifying  his  deportation.
    Further, the Presenting Officer was not recorded as  having  relied  on
    this factor in his argument before the panel.

30. Dealing with the arguments advanced on behalf of the Secretary of State
    relying on the Court  of  Appeal  decision  in  SS  (Nigeria),  it  was
    submitted that the panel's decision had dealt properly with the  public
    interest in deporting foreign criminals.  Obviously, the panel had  not
    referred specifically to the decision  in  SS  (Nigeria)  because  that
    decision had not been promulgated by the time  of  this  decision.   SS
    (Nigeria) was not promulgated until 22 May 2013, which was  some  eight
    days  after  this  decision  had  been  promulgated.   Nonetheless,  at
    paragraph 7 of the determination, this panel had set out  the  relevant
    provisions of sections 32 and 33 of the UK Borders Act  2007  including
    in particular section 33(7) which is the section referred to by Laws LJ
    in SS (Nigeria) as the relevant public interest  provision  enacted  by
    Parliament.  At  paragraph  25  of  the  determination,  in  the  first
    sentence, the panel had stated in terms that "we recognise  that  there
    is a powerful public interest in the deportation  of  foreign  national
    offenders and that Section 32 of the 2007  Act  gives  effect  to  it".
    While the panel does not specifically say in terms that it took account
    of the fact that the public interest  in  the  deportation  of  foreign
    criminals was not now just contained within the Rules but was the  will
    of Parliament, it is obvious from paragraph 25 that this was  in  their
    minds.  The fact that this provision was enshrined in  legislation  and
    not just in the Rules was also referred to at paragraph  41,  where  it
    was stated that the panel took full account of the Secretary of State's
    view of the public interest which was "now enshrined in  the  automatic
    deportation legislation".

31. It did not appear, because there is no record within the determination,
    that the Secretary of State's representative at the hearing had  argued
    that the panel should give even more weight to the Secretary of State's
    view because it was now enshrined within  legislation.   This  argument
    did not seem to have been  advanced,  beyond  a  general  reference  to
    Section  32,  which  is  what  this  Tribunal  was  dealing  with,  but
    nonetheless the panel gave specific reference  to  the  fact  that  the
    policy was now contained within primary legislation.

32. Insofar as  a  judgment  now  has  to  be  seen  to  be  "SS  (Nigeria)
    compliant", this decision was.  Also, it should be noted that  although
    the Court of Appeal in SS  (Nigeria)  focuses  on  the  fact  that  the
    Secretary of State's policy, which was now enshrined in legislation was
    that it would be conducive  for  the  public  good  to  deport  foreign
    criminals, it is also the law, as expressed by Parliament, in the  same
    part of this statute, that exceptions  can  apply  and  that  in  these
    cases, an applicant should not be deported.  So Parliament  has  itself
    decreed that there can be exceptions where although it is conducive  to
    the public good to deport a foreign criminal,  nonetheless  he  or  she
    should not be deported.

33. In this case, the  panel  was  well  aware  that  the  legislature  was
    endorsing the Secretary of State's policy and this was  properly  taken
    into account.  The argument advanced on  behalf  of  the  Secretary  of
    State that more weight should have been  given  to  this  factor  is  a
    complaint about weight, and matters of weight  are  for  the  Tribunal.
    The arguments advanced on behalf of the Secretary of State did not make
    out an arguable error of law.  This was a well thought  out  and  well-
    structured determination and the panel  reached  a  decision  that  the
    legitimate public aim which clearly existed and had  been  endorsed  by
    Parliament, when balanced against the  claimant's  family  and  private
    life rights, was outweighed by those Article 8 rights such that removal
    was disproportionate.  The panel had looked at the  totality  of  these
    facts, balanced them fairly and by no means perversely and had  reached
    a conclusion which was reasonable and lawfully open to it.

34. In reply, Mr Jarvis stressed that overstaying was a  criminal  offence,
    and its seriousness could not be waived by a Presenting  Officer.   The
    panel had an obligation to take full account of this factor, even if it
    had not been specifically argued before it.  Although it  was  referred
    to when the panel was setting out the claimant's  immigration  history,
    the panel had not  made  reference  to  this  factor  when  considering
    proportionality.  This was missed, even though it was clearly relevant.



35. Although the panel had at paragraph 41 referred  to  the  Secretary  of
    State's view of  the  public  interest  being  now  "enshrined  in  the
    automatic  deportation  legislation",  this  still  referred   to   the
    Secretary of State's view.  The point which was being made on behalf of
    the Secretary of State was that this was  not  just  the  Secretary  of
    State's view enshrined in legislation, but was the will of  Parliament.
    Mr Jarvis appreciated that this was "a subtle point",  but  nonetheless
    this was what the Court of Appeal was saying in SS (Nigeria).  This was
    not just the Secretary of State's view.  The Court of  Appeal  was  not
    saying that exceptions were irrelevant, but that the balance should  be
    got right, after proper weight had been  given  to  Parliament's  will.
    Again, the failure of the Presenting Officer to make this  argument  in
    terms was besides the point.  The Court of Appeal in SS  (Nigeria)  was
    declaring what the law had always been and  therefore  any  failure  to
    make this point in argument did not mean that that law should not  have
    been applied.



Discussion

36. I deal first with the argument advanced in the grounds, which  was  not
    developed before me in argument.  It is suggested in the  grounds  that
    when considering whether or not the claimant's wife could reasonably be
    expected to accompany him to Ghana, the panel had "failed  to  consider
    that 'what must be shown was more  than  a  mere  hardship  or  a  mere
    difficulty or  mere  obstacle.   There  is  a  seriousness  test  which
    requires the obstacles or difficulties to go beyond matters  of  choice
    or inconvenience'"  (as per VW (Uganda) [2009] EWCA Civ 5).  It is then
    said that the panel had "failed to consider whether family  life  could
    be continued through visits and other  means  of  modern  communication
    particularly with [the claimant's wife's] grandchild and son".

37. In my judgment,  there  is  no  merit  in  this  argument.   The  panel
    considered the position  of  the  claimant's  wife  very  carefully  at
    paragraph 40 of the determination and had in mind that  the  claimant's
    wife, who is aged 54, had lived in the UK for 40 years, since  she  had
    emigrated from Jamaica.  She was a British citizen, had  no  connection
    of her own with Ghana and cared for her elderly and infirm mother,  who
    lived here.  She also had a son in this country who  was  described  as
    "immature"  and  was  "closely  involved   with   her   granddaughter's
    upbringing".  Having considered these factors, and  concluded  that  it
    would not be reasonable to expect the claimant's wife to accompany  him
    to Ghana, the panel made a finding, which was open  to  it,  that  "the
    proposed deportation of the [claimant] will effectively end [his] nine-
    year marriage and will terminate  his  contact  with  his  stepson  and
    granddaughter" (paragraph 43).  It was for the panel to  make  findings
    of fact, which it did, and this particular finding is, in my  judgment,
    properly reasoned.

38. I turn now to consider the arguments which were advanced on  behalf  of
    the Secretary of State for the first time before me by Mr Jarvis.   The
    main thrust of Mr Jarvis's submissions was that  the  panel  failed  to
    have sufficient regard to the fact that it was not just the  policy  of
    the Secretary of State that the deportation of foreign  criminals  such
    as this claimant was conducive to the public good, but that this was an
    expression of the will of Parliament.  The second argument advanced  by
    Mr Jarvis was that the panel erred by not putting  any  weight  on  the
    undoubted fact that this claimant was an overstayer.

39. Prior to giving his judgment in SS (Nigeria),  Laws  LJ  had  expressed
    similar views in the case of Richards v SSHD [2013]  EWCA  Civ  244,  a
    judgment given in January this year.  Although  Mr  Jarvis  handed  the
    Tribunal a copy of this judgment, he did not refer to it  in  argument.
    At paragraph 21, Laws LJ stated as follows:

         "What in my judgment needs  emphasis  is  that  the  strong  public
         interest in deporting foreign  criminals  is  now  not  merely  the
         policy of the Secretary of State but the  judgment  of  Parliament.
         That gives it special weight, which the courts ought to  recognise,
         as no doubt the Strasbourg Court will.  This approach sits with the
         well-established approach to proportionality questions in  European
         Union law where acts of the primary legislator enjoy a wider margin
         of discretion (see R v  Secretary  of  State  for  Health  ex-parte
         Eastside Cheese [1999] 3 CMLR 123 per Lord Bingham,  especially  at
         paragraph 48)."

40. Mr Jarvis places particular reliance on the finding  of  the  Court  of
    Appeal in SS (Nigeria), as expressed by Laws LJ at paragraph 54:

         "I would draw particular attention to the  provision  contained  in
         s.33(7):  'section  32(4)  applies  despite  the   application   of
         Exception 1...', that is to say, a foreign  criminal's  deportation
         remains conducive to the public good notwithstanding his successful
         reliance on Article 8. I  said  at  paragraph  46  that  while  the
         authorities demonstrate that there is no rule of exceptionality for
         Article 8, they also clearly show that the more pressing the public
         interest in removal or deportation, the stronger must be the  claim
         under Article 8 if it is to prevail. The  pressing  nature  of  the
         public interest here is  vividly  informed  by  the  fact  that  by
         Parliament's express declaration the public interest is injured  if
         the criminal's deportation is not effected. Such a result could  in
         my judgment only be justified by a very strong claim indeed."

41. Mr Jarvis asks this Tribunal to find that the panel's consideration  of
    the facts in this case was not, as he puts it "SS (Nigeria) compliant".
     He asks the  Tribunal  to  find  that  the  panel  did  not  accord  a
    sufficiently wide "margin of appreciation" to the fact that  Parliament
    decreed that the deportation of offenders such  as  this  claimant  was
    conducive to the public good and that this was a factor which should be
    accorded very great weight.

42. Although Mr Jarvis appreciated that the panel  had  clearly  recognised
    that the policy of the Secretary of State was now enshrined in  an  Act
    of Parliament, that was not the same as appreciating that this  was  in
    effect the will of  Parliament,  rather  than  just  the  Secretary  of
    State's policy as endorsed by Parliament.  While Mr Jarvis  appreciated
    that this was perhaps a "subtle" distinction, nonetheless he asked  the
    Tribunal to consider that it was a proper distinction to make.

43. I have within this determination  attempted  to  set  out  Mr  Jarvis's
    argument on this point fully, because it is an important one which must
    be considered in light of the guidance given by the  Court  of  Appeal.
    However, in this case, I do not think this  argument  is  well-founded.
    It is undoubtedly the case, as Laws LJ stated both in Richards  and  SS
    (Nigeria) that any fact-finder must accord great  weight  to  the  fact
    that Parliament has enacted that the deportation of  foreign  criminals
    such as this claimant is conducive to the public good.  It is not  open
    to an applicant to argue that in his  or  her  case  it  would  not  be
    conducive to the public good to deport him because, for example, he  no
    longer presented a risk of further offending.  Parliament  has  decided
    that the deportation of foreign criminals is conducive  to  the  public
    good and a fact-finder must give weight to this factor.

44. However, in this case, the panel did precisely this.  At paragraph 7 of
    its determination the panel set out the relevant  sections  of  the  UK
    Borders Act, and it is apparent from this paragraph that the panel  had
    regard in particular to  the  provisions  of  Section  32(4)  that  the
    deportation of this claimant was conducive to the public good  (because
    this is what Parliament has decreed) and also to Section 32(5) that the
    Secretary of State must make a deportation order  in  respect  of  this
    claimant (because he is, in the  terms  of  this  statute,  a  "foreign
    criminal") unless he comes within one of the exceptions set out  within
    Section 33.  By Section 33(2)(a) such a person should not  be  deported
    where his deportation would be in breach of his Convention  rights  (in
    this case his Article 8 rights), although by Section 33(7)  that  would
    not mean that his deportation would not  be  conducive  to  the  public
    good.  In other words, even though  Parliament  has  enacted  that  the
    deportation of people such as this claimant will be  conducive  to  the
    public good, it has also recognised that  there  will  be  cases  where
    there are factors relating to an individual's Article  8  rights  which
    outweigh the need for deportation.  It follows  that  the  courts  must
    continue to carry out a balancing exercise.

45. It is apparent from paragraph 41 of the panel's determination, in which
    it is said that "we take full account of the Secretary of State's  view
    of the public interest, now  enshrined  in  the  automatic  deportation
    legislation" that the panel appreciated that the Secretary  of  State's
    view of the need to deport foreign  criminals,  which  is  to  say  the
    public interest in  deporting  foreign  criminals,  was  a  view  which
    represented the will of Parliament.  However, as  provided  by  Section
    33, this does not mean that there will never be cases where the Article
    8 factors which must be considered will outweigh this public  interest.
    To this end, the panel was both entitled and obliged to  consider  just
    how strong in this case the  public  interest  was  in  deporting  this
    particular claimant.  Although it is clearly  (because  Parliament  had
    said it is) in the public interest, and is conducive to the public good
    to deport this claimant, it is not as conducive to the public  good  as
    it would be were his offence more serious,  as  was  the  offending  in
    other cases cited within the determination.

46. In my judgment, this was a  thorough  and  detailed  determination,  in
    which the panel analysed all  the  competing  factors  with  care,  and
    reached a decision on proportionality which was entirely open to it.

47. I can deal briefly with the other argument advanced on  behalf  of  the
    Secretary of State by Mr Jarvis.  It is simply not correct to say  that
    the panel did not have in mind that this claimant  was  an  overstayer.
    This is stated in terms at paragraph 2 of the determination.  The panel
    was fully aware of this claimant's immigration history.   However,  the
    panel was entitled, when considering the weight to be given to the fact
    that he was an overstayer, to take account of the fact  that  this  was
    not a factor to which the Secretary of State herself appeared to attach
    much weight.  Not only was this not raised as a serious factor  in  the
    refusal letter, but the Presenting Officer did not rely on this  factor
    when addressing the panel.  The panel was not obliged to  repeat  later
    in the determination the matters which had  already  been  set  out  at
    paragraph 2.

48. In my judgment, it is precisely because the panel was so aware  of  the
    fact that Parliament has now decreed that deportation of people such as
    this claimant is in the public interest that it found, at paragraph 45,
    that "this case is finely balanced".  Otherwise, the factors suggesting
    that the claimant's deportation would be  disproportionate  might  well
    have been found to outweigh the public interest even more clearly  than
    they did.  However, even after taking  full  account  of  the  will  of
    Parliament, when enacting that deportation  of  foreign  criminals  was
    conducive to the public good (as I find the panel  did)  it  was  still
    able to find at paragraph 45 that it was "not satisfied that the public
    interest in the deportation of this [claimant] outweighs his  right  to
    continue to exercise his right to family life with his wife in the UK."
     In light of this finding, which I consider the panel was  entitled  to
    reach, the panel had no alternative other than to go on to  find  "that
    he comes within the exception in Section 32(2)(a), in that  deportation
    would breach his  ECHR  rights".   The  panel  considered  the  factors
    relating to proportionality entirely properly, and there is no arguable
    error of law in its determination.  It follows that  the  Secretary  of
    State's appeal must be dismissed.







Decision

There being no material error of law  in  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
Tribunal, this appeal by the Secretary of State is dismissed.
