                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Pedro, promulgated on 5 December 2018. Permission to appeal was granted
    by Upper Tribunal Judge Grubb on 19 February 2019.

Anonymity

   2. No direction has been made previously, and there is no reason for  one
      now

Background

 3. On 30 May 2017, the appellants sought EEA family permits  in  order  to
    enter the United Kingdom as the direct  dependent  relatives  of  their
    son, Shajee [K] and his German wife.   The  application  of  the  first
    appellant was refused on 20  February  2018  and  that  of  the  second
    appellant on 30 November 2017.

 4. Hitherto, they had unsuccessfully sought family permits to  join  their
    other son, Wajeeh and his EEA national partner.  Their  appeal  against
    that decision was dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge Turquet  in  a
    decision promulgated on 18 October 2016.

 5. The Entry Clearance Officer's decisions made reference to  the  earlier
    unsuccessful appeal. The  reasons  for  refusal  were  that  there  was
    insufficient evidence to show that the sponsoring household would be in
    any position to support  the  appellants;  that  the  appellants'  bank
    account  was  in  credit  which  called  into  question   the   claimed
    dependency, there was no evidence that the rent  or  bills  were  being
    paid by the sponsor and it was not accepted that the  regular  payments
    from the sponsor were required for the appellants' essential needs.

The hearing before the First-tier Tribunal

 6. At the hearing before the  First-tier  Tribunal,  the  appellants  were
    unrepresented, however their sons  Shajee  and  Wajeeh  attended,  gave
    evidence and provided a bundle of supporting evidence. In reaching  his
    decision, the judge took into consideration the 2016 decision of  Judge
    Turquet and adopted the findings in rejecting the claims of  dependency
    on the sponsor.

The grounds of appeal

 7. In the grounds of appeal it was contended  that  the  judge  failed  to
    assess the documentary evidence which was not before the previous judge
    as to the financial position of the  appellants  at  the  time  of  the
    application; that the judge erred in his approach to the principles  in
    Devaseelan (Second  Appeals,  ECHR,  Extra-territorial  Effect)  [2002]
    UKIAT 702; erred in requiring historic evidence  of  dependency;  found
    that there had been an abuse of rights where that point was not  relied
    upon by the respondent; failed to apply the correct test of  dependency
    and lastly erred in relying on the 2016 decision which itself contained
    errors of law.

 8. Permission to appeal was granted on  all  grounds  with  the  following
    comment;

    "In reaching his finding that the appellants have not shown  they  were
    dependent for their "basic needs" upon their son  and  daughter-in-law,
    it is arguable that the judge  placed  undue  weight  upon  an  earlier
    appeal decision which related to different sponsors  (a  different  son
    and EEA partner) and failed properly to consider the detailed  evidence
    submitted in this appeal."

The hearing

 9. Mr Enuezie submitted that he would mainly be  arguing  that  the  judge
    erred in his application of Devaseelan and his failure to take  account
    of the appellants' documents. He said that  Devaseelan  did  not  apply
    because the sponsor, circumstances and documents  were  all  different.
    Furthermore, it was not reasonable nor relevant for the judge to expect
    the appellants to produce evidence going back as far as 2013.  All  the
    appellants needed to demonstrate was present dependency.


  10. Mr Enuezie further argued that the judge was  wrong  to  describe  the
      appellants' evidence as self-serving  when  it  was  from  independent
      sources. Indeed, it was accepted  that  the  first  appellant  was  in
      receipt of a monthly pension. He submitted that while the  judge  said
      that the evidence was contrived to boost the appeal he did not set out
      in clear terms why he came to that decision and materially misdirected
      himself in law.


  11. Ms Willocks-Briscoe submitted that the judge was entitled to take  the
      previous decision as the starting point because the appeal was on  the
      same basis and  the  findings  were  applicable.  The  previous  judge
      concluded that the appellants failed to show they were supported. This
      was  the  starting  point  and  there  had  not  been  a   change   in
      circumstances  since  that  original  decision.  The  judge  was   not
      satisfied the evidence presented a true and accurate reflection of the
      outgoings [12], gave little weight to letters and receipts and was  of
      the view that the  situation  presented  to  bolster  the  appellants'
      position. The  appellants  circumstances  had  not  changed  only  the
      sponsor and the decision made was open to the judge.


  12. In reply, Mr Enuezie contended that the judge was required to consider
      the evidence and make a determination. The previous decision  did  not
      find that there was fraud but  that  insufficient  evidence  had  been
      provided. There were no credibility issues. The judge was not entitled
      to reject the evidence without  reasons.  How  could  he  say  nothing
      changed if he did not examine the evidence. The only source of  income
      was the pension and the rent and groceries  were  properly  documented
      unlike the previous appeal. Lastly,  the  appellants  could  not  have
      envisaged they needed to provide evidence from 2005-2013 and it was an
      error to insist on this evidence.


  13. At the end of the hearing I decided that the First-tier Tribunal  made
      material errors of law because the previous decision was dismissed for
      want of supporting evidence and the judge erred in just  adopting  the
      previous findings with very little consideration of the new  material.
      There was no option but to set  the  decision  aside  and  remake  the
      decision.

Decision on error of law

14. In dismissing the  appellants'  previous  appeal,  Judge  Turquet  took
    account of inconsistencies between the account  put  forward  by  their
    son, Wajeeh and the visa application form [20] and noted the absence of
    supporting evidence showing that the appellants had been  supported  by
    Wajeeh prior to 2013[21].

15. Judge Turquet also found there to be a  lack  of  supporting  documents
    relating to  the  appellants'  outgoings  [23].  The  present  sponsor,
    Shajee, was not a  witness  in  the  earlier  proceedings  [22].  Judge
    Turquet concluded that as of 6 September 2016, the appellants  had  not
    satisfied her that they were dependent on their son Wajeeh.

16. The findings  of  Judge  Turquet  in  2016  regarding  the  appellants'
    financial circumstances and sponsorship by a different person were  not
    the starting point  for  their  appeal  two  years  later  involving  a
    different sponsor. Owing to the judge's  adoption  of  Judge  Turquet's
    findings, he failed to adequately  consider  the  documentary  evidence
    before him, much of which addressed the  lack  of  supporting  evidence
    referred  to  in  the  earlier  decision.  Indeed  at  [12]  the  judge
    summarises the appellants' evidence in the following way," I find  that
    I can give little weight to the various letters and receipts that  have
    been produced as they do not sway me from  the  conclusion  that  Judge
    Turquet reached in the 2016 decision."  That treatment of the  evidence
    and an earlier comment dismissing the new  evidence  as  "self-serving"
    without further comment was unsatisfactory.

17. The judge was required to assess the evidence provided in  the  appeal,
    which included evidence of the appellants' expenses in the form of rent
    receipts, utility bills, medical bills,  receipts  for  groceries,  the
    rent deed and statement from their landlord. In addition, there  was  a
    summary of the appellants  expenditure  and  the  proportion  that  was
    covered by the remittances from the sponsor.

18. There is no requirement of historical dependency under the Regulations,
    what is in issue in a case involving a family member is the position at
    the time of the hearing. Judge Pedro erred  in  finding  at  [11]  that
    "there was the same absence of evidence before  me  to  show  that  the
    appellants were being supported by Wajeed, as claimed from  2005  until
    2013." The appellants' dependency on a different sponsor five years  or
    more prior to the hearing is of no consequence in 2018. The  appellants
    were claiming present dependency on Shajee and  his  wife  and  claimed
    that they had been dependent upon him only since late 2016.

Remaking

19. Having found material errors of law in the decision of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, I proceeded to remake the decision.

20. Ms Willocks-Briscoe requested time to consider the additional  evidence
    submitted on behalf of the appellants on 12 March 2019,  under  section
    15 (2A) of the Upper Tribunal Procedure Rules 2008.  When  the  hearing
    resumed, both representatives were in agreement with  the  relationship
    between the appellants and the sponsors and that financial  support  is
    being provided. The only matter in issue was whether the support of the
    sponsors was necessary for the appellants' essential needs.

21. Mr Shajee [K] gave evidence.  He relied on his earlier statement and in
    response to Mr Enuezie's questions, he explained  that  the  appellants
    had changed address and as a consequence the rent had gone  up  to  PKR
    15,000 per month since 1 February 2019. The pension  was  unchanged  at
    PKR 11,068 per month.

22. Mr [K] explained that his parents had  to  move  because  the  landlord
    wanted to demolish the property as it was too  old  and  unsafe.  Rents
    were higher in the new area whereas the rent for the previous  property
    was lower because of the age and condition of the property. When  asked
    how the appellants would manage if he did not support them,  he  stated
    that they would be homeless and have no money for medicines  or  living
    costs.  He confirmed the appellants did not live with anyone else.

23. During cross-examination, Mr [K] explained that his father was a police
    constable before he retired and his government  pension  did  not  come
    with a pension pot which he could access for  more  funds.  His  father
    used to have a pension book stating how much money he would receive but
    that had been replaced by a direct payment into his  bank  account.  Mr
    [K] did not know anything more about the terms of the pension  and  had
    not seen any other documents relating to it. Ms Willocks-Briscoe  asked
    Mr [K] why his parents  had  rented  such  an  expensive  property.  He
    replied that it was not particularly expensive,  it  was  just  average
    rent for the area. He referred to the  evidence  of  the  rent  in  the
    bundle. With regard  to  the  lack  of  challenge  to  Judge  Turquet's
    decision, Mr [K] explained that this was because the circumstances  had
    changed. When asked why his parents did not use  a  bank  card  to  pay
    their expenses, Mr [K] stated that they live in  rural  area  where  no
    shop accepts card payments. Finally, he explained he had  prepared  the
    summary of expenses  in  the  appellants'  bundle.  There  was  no  re-
    examination.

24. Ms Willocks-Briscoe submissions relied on the  decisions  refusing  the
    family permits. She argued that no documents relating  to  the  pension
    have been provided and  such  documents  might  show  evidence  of  the
    ability to draw down further funds.  The pension documents  could  have
    easily been provided. An ability to draw down funds would  have  direct
    bearing on whether the need for material support  had  been  made  out,
    applying Lim [2015] EWCA Civ 1383. She accepted the evidence of support
    shown in the money transfer receipts. With  regard  to  the  change  of
    circumstances since the last hearing, she  argued  that  there  was  no
    evidence that average property prices were around PKR15,000, there  was
    no evidence regarding the accommodation or eviction.  Furthermore,  the
    receipts were not addressed to anyone in particular.

25. Mr Enuezie submitted that it was accepted that the first appellant  was
    in receipt of a pension. One could not envisage that an issue regarding
    draw down possibilities would arise in these proceedings. Such evidence
    which one could get easily in the United Kingdom might  not  be  easily
    obtainable in Pakistan. The first appellant had a pension book and then
    direct payments, there was no  evidence  that  there  was  a  lump  sum
    available to be drawn upon. While he understood the  situation  in  Lim
    where the parents had funds they did not access as they wished to leave
    a legacy. In this case there was no evidence of the availability  of  a
    lump sum.  Mr Enuezie  acknowledged  that  there  was  no  evidence  of
    average  income  or  rents  in  Rabwah,  however  the  authorities  say
    essential needs must be met by the sponsor. The appellants reside in  a
    rural  area  and  had  to  find  a  suitable  property.   It  was   not
    extravagant, it is part of their essential needs. At this point Mr  [K]
    alerted Mr Enuezie to a  weblink  he  had  referenced  in  his  witness
    statements with regard to average living costs in Pakistan.

26. The above-mentioned weblink estimated that it would cost �65 per  month
    for food alone, per  person.  Finally,  the  appellants'  accommodation
    costs exceeded their personal income and they required the  support  of
    the sponsor. In addition they had health issues for which  they  needed
    financial assistance.

27. At the end of the hearing I reserved my decision.

28. In reaching my decision,  I  have  taken  into  consideration  all  the
    evidence before me and  the  submissions  made.  I  have  assessed  the
    appellants' circumstances as at the date of the hearing before me.  The
    burden is on the appellants to prove, on the balance of  probabilities,
    that they are dependent on the EEA sponsor for their  essential  living
    needs.

29. The evidence before me was that the appellants' sole source of  income,
    other than from  remittances,  is  the  first  appellant's  pension  of
    PKR11,078 per month which is equivalent to around �60 per month at  the
    time of the  hearing.  The  pension  payment  is  shown  in  the  first
    appellant's bank statements. The same bank statements  also  show  that
    the pension payments are withdrawn in full each month.  The  appellants
    were taken by surprise with the submission that there was  no  evidence
    regarding a pension fund or the  ability  to  draw  down  a  lump  sum.
    However, there is no evidence to suggest that a government  pension  in
    Pakistan would have these features.

30. There is no dispute that the sponsors send regular remittances  to  the
    appellants and have been doing so for well over two years. I  note  the
    ECO's  concerns  regarding  the  sponsors'  ability  to   support   the
    appellants, however there was reliable evidence in the  form  of  P60's
    and payslips showing that the sponsors' joint income is close to �2,000
    per month after tax. I therefore accept that they are able  to  sponsor
    the appellants to the tune of around the  two  hundred  pounds  plus  a
    month sent via Western Union.

31. The appellants' previous rent was PKR7,000 per month and has  increased
    to PKR15,000 per month. According to the receipts and bills enclosed in
    the appellants' bundle their other expenses come to  around  a  further
    PKR40,000 (�217) per month. Contrary to the submissions  on  behalf  of
    the respondent, a  link  was  provided  to  the  Numbeo  website  which
    provides figures for living  costs  for  various  countries,  including
    Pakistan. No criticism was made of this source by Ms  Willocks-Briscoe.
    Having examined the website, I could see no reason not to  attach  some
    weight to its data. Numbeo indicates that  average  rents  in  Pakistan
    outside of cities are between PKR11,000 and PKR  25,000,  depending  on
    the size of the property. The appellants' current rent does not  appear
    extravagant  in  comparison.  The  tenancy  agreement   for   the   new
    accommodation was enclosed in the Rule  15(2A)  bundle  along  with  an
    affidavit from the landlord stating that the appellants were obliged to
    pay the electricity and gas bills.  There  was  no  criticism  of  that
    evidence and I could see no reason to reject  it.  The  Numbeo  weblink
    estimates that basic utilities cost  around  PKR8,000  per  month.  The
    appellants' expenditure on utilities at  their  previous  house  was  a
    little less than this sum. The appellants' remaining expenditure is  on
    food, medicines and  clothing.  Receipts  for  these  items  have  been
    provided. In particular, I note that PKR7612 (�41) was  spent  on  food
    for the month for them both. The weblink recommends  a  budget  of  PKR
    12,000 (�65) per person on food per month.

32. In view of the reliable evidence of the appellants'  income,  rent  and
    other expenses, it is obvious that the pension income of PKR11,000  per
    month is insufficient to meet their rent of PKR15,000  per  month,  let
    alone their other expenses. I have carefully considered the findings in
    Lim, however there is no evidence that the appellants  have  access  to
    savings, a retirement fund and property like the claimant in that case.
    It is apparent from the bank statements that the appellants  spend  all
    their income as soon as its paid in and that they are  reliant  on  the
    remittances from abroad to meet the majority of their essential  needs.
    On balance, I am satisfied that the appellants are dependent  upon  the
    sponsor and meet the requirements of Regulations 7 and 12 of  the  2016
    Regulations.

Conclusions


The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  involved  the  making
of an error on a point of law.

I set aside the decision to be re-made.

I  substitute  a  decision  allowing  the  appeal  on  the  basis  that  the
appellants met the requirements of the Immigration (European Economic  Area)
Regulations 2016.
