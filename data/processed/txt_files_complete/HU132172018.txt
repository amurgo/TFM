For the Appellant:     Ms J Bond, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Ms J Isherwood, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant appeals  against  the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Coutts dismissing her appeal against the refusal of an application  for
    further leave to  remain  on  the  basis  of  her  human  rights.   The
    Appellant appealed against Judge Coutts' decision of 24th October  2018
    and permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge  McWilliam
    in the following terms:

         "Whilst Ground 2 fails to have regard to AM (s 117B) Malawi  [2015]
         UKUT 0260, I grant permission on the issue  raised  in  respect  of
         Rhuppia [2018] UKSC 58.  The case was  decided  after  the  hearing
         before  the  FTT,  so  the  judge  cannot  be  criticised  for  not
         considering the s.117A(2) point; however, ultimately the  issue  is
         whether the judge erred in respect of  proportionality  and  it  is
         arguable that he did.  Permission is granted on all grounds."

 2. I was not provided with a Rule 24 response from the Respondent but  was
    given the indication that the appeal was resisted.

Error of Law

 3. At the close of the hearing I reserved my decision which  I  shall  now
    give.  I do find that there is a material error of law in the  decision
    such that it should be set aside.  My reasons for  so  finding  are  as
    follows.

 4. In respect of the Grounds of Appeal as framed by Ms Bond,  I  indicated
    at the outset of the hearing (and there was no argument to the contrary
    from the Secretary of State) that Ground 1 was correctly framed in that
    it  did  reveal  that   the   First-tier   Tribunal   was   under   the
    misapprehension of fact that the  Respondent's  decision  refusing  the
    application for further leave to remain on the basis of the Appellant's
    human rights was premised upon the Appellant's son now being an  adult;
    whereas, the  refusal  was  in  fact  based  upon  the  fact  that  the
    Appellant's son had apparently formed an independent life  for  himself
    and was living separately from the Appellant (it was emphasised, and so
    I note, that the previous grant of leave to the Appellant  and  to  her
    son, who was then a minor and who is not party to these proceedings  he
    having been granted a further period of leave, was given to him when he
    was already an adult having turned 18 years of age  but,  albeit  still
    living with his mother, the Appellant at that time).  I indicated to Ms
    Bond that whilst Ground 1 highlighted an  error  of  law,  on  its  own
    however that error would not result in a material  error  of  law  such
    that the decision should be set aside unless it was  demonstrated  that
    the misapprehension of fact would have had a material impact  upon  the
    outcome of the appeal.

 5. Turning to Ground 2, and the basis upon which Judge  McWilliam  granted
    permission to appeal, I note, as did Judge McWilliam, that the  Supreme
    Court's decision  in  Rhuppiah  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2018] UKSC 58 was promulgated after the decision  of  Judge
    Coutts in the First-tier Tribunal, and consequently Judge Coutts  would
    not have considered the limited degree of  flexibility  within  Section
    117A(2)(a) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  which
    enables the statutory  provision  in  Section  117B(5)  (regarding  the
    precariousness of a person's private life in the UK), to be  overridden
    by, what had been described by Lord  Justice  Sales  in  the  Court  of
    Appeal  and  approved  by  Lord  Wilson  in  the  Supreme   Court,   as
    "particularly strong features" of a person's private life.  As  such  I
    take note of [49] and [50] of Rhuppiah v Secretary  of  State  for  the
    Home Department [2018] UKSC 58, wherein the Supreme  Court  noted  that
    "particularly strong features" may result in weight being  given  to  a
    private life in question notwithstanding  Section  117B(5),  and  which
    owing to the recent promulgation of the binding decision  in  Rhuppiah,
    would not have been taken into  account  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal.
    Such "particularly strong features" of private life  in  this  instance
    may have been, for example, the Appellant's  residence  in  the  United
    Kingdom (albeit unlawfully) since November 2000 till date (a period  of
    almost 18 years residence), as well as other features.  Thus I do  find
    that there is an error of law in respect of Ground 2.

 6. Turning to  Ground  3,  and  the  assertion  that  the  proportionality
    exercise has not been  accurately  conducted  in  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal has failed to give sufficient weight to the  Appellant's  care
    work and has erred in respect of whether the Appellant can re-enter the
    UK (see ��62 to 67 of the First-tier  Tribunal's  decision),  may  have
    resulted in material errors of law, I  do  find  that  this  ground  is
    somewhat more tenuous than the previous  two  in  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal has noted the Appellant's care work, albeit  that  the  First-
    tier Tribunal does not appear to have considered whether this care work
    would result in weight being reduced in respect of the public  interest
    in the Appellant's removal (that may be gauged by  the  extent  of  her
    failure to meet the Immigration Rules in question)  such  matters  will
    only be of limited utility in light of the decision from the  President
    of the Upper  Tribunal  in  Thakrar  (Cart  JR)  Article  8:  Value  to
    Community) [2018] UKUT 336 (IAC) which commented most recently upon the
    judgment of the Court of Appeal in UE (Nigeria) and Others v  Secretary
    of State for the Home Department [2010] EWCA Civ 975 and the concept of
    a person's service to the community impacting upon the  proportionality
    assessment that may take place as  a  consequence.   I  also  note  the
    submission that the First-tier Tribunal's finding  that  the  Appellant
    would be on a level playing field in terms of re-entry  to  the  United
    Kingdom may also suffer from error in that I am told by Ms  Bond,  that
    care work does not fall under the Tier 2 Shortage Occupation Scheme and
    albeit that the UK suffers  from  a  shortage  of  care  workers,  this
    category of work does not  fall  into  the  shortage  occupation  codes
    within the Immigration Rules.  In any event, there may be an error here
    in this respect notwithstanding that Grounds 1 and 2  demonstrate  that
    the decision should be set aside.

 7. Before I conclude, I record my thanks to Ms. Isherwood  whom  performed
    her submissions admirably under difficult circumstances during a heated
    and emotional hearing.  Although Ms. Bond apologised on behalf  of  the
    Appellant's son for his outburst, and I decided to let the matter  lie,
    I must make clear that such events are never to be repeated,  as  there
    is no good  reason  for  any  person  hindering  a  party  from  making
    submissions as they are employed or instructed to do, as the  case  may
    be.

 8. In light of the above findings, I set aside the decision of the  First-
    tier Tribunal in its entirety.

Notice of Decision

 9. The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is allowed.

10. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside in  its  entirety.
    This matter is to be remitted to be heard by a differently  constituted
    bench.

Directions

11. The appeal is to be remitted to IAC Hatton Cross.

12. No interpreter is required.

13. I anticipate that the Appellant and her son may wish to give evidence.

14. The time estimate for this appeal is two hours.

15. No special directions have been sought and I do not see any  reason  to
    issue any.

16. No anonymity direction has been requested and none is necessary  in  my
    view.
