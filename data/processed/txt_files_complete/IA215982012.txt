                               HUMAIRRA MAHIN

                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                             SECRETARY OF STATE

                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     None
For the Respondent:    Mr Tarlow


                              NOTICE (Rule 17A)

The matter was listed for hearing and there  was  no  appearance  by  or  on
behalf of the applicant and no explanation for  his  non-attendance.  It  is
appropriate to proceed in the circumstances under rule 38.

Mr Tarlow advised me that the appellant had in fact been  removed  from  the
United Kingdom on 23rd November 2012. Accordingly  he  invited  me  to  find
that the appeal had been  abandoned  under  s  104(4)  of  the  Nationality,
Immigration and Asylum Act, 2002.

I am satisfied that this is the case.

In the premises the Tribunal is required to issue a Notice that the appeal
has been treated as abandoned under rule 17A of the Procedure Rules.

This appeal is treated as abandoned accordingly.








Signed
                               Upper Tribunal Judge Warr


                               3 March 2014
