                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal,  with  permission,  by  the
    Appellant with regard to a determination  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge Cohen) promulgated on 20th  March  2014.  In  his  determination
    Judge Cohen dismissed the Appellant's appeal against  the  decision  of
    the Secretary of State to refuse to issue her with a residence card  as
    the extended family member of an EEA national.

 2. This appeal was in my 2pm list. Shortly before 2 pm I was notified of a
    telephone message indicating that counsel in the case had been  delayed
    at Hatton Cross First-tier Tribunal hearing centre and  asking  that  I
    take the other case first and not hear this case until 3.30.  I  agreed
    to take the other case first but declined to wait until  3.30  to  call
    this case on given that it had been listed at 2 pm. I asked my clerk to
    contact the Appellant's solicitors  notifying  them  that  I  would  be
    hearing the case once I had dealt with the first case. This prompted  a
    fax from the solicitors asking for an adjournment  on  the  basis  that
    counsel was detained and the  person  dealing  with  the  case  at  the
    solicitors had been called to hospital urgently and there  was  no  one
    else who could cover. This was  highly  unsatisfactory.  The  case  was
    listed some time ago and listed  at  2  pm.  Counsel  should  not  have
    accepted the brief if there was any prospect of his not being  able  to
    be present in time for the hearing.

 3. I considered adjourning the  case  but  took  the  view  that,  as  the
    Appellant was present and the matter was listed for an initial  hearing
    which meant I had to first decide whether the First-tier  Tribunal  had
    made an error of  law  and  if  so  whether  and  to  what  extent  the
    determination should be set aside, I could deal with it on the basis of
    the grounds which had  been  settled  by  Counsel.   If  it  should  be
    necessary to redecide the appeal I would then  consider  adjourning  to
    allow the Appellant to be represented. I  did  not  consider  that  the
    Appellant was prejudiced by Counsel's absence.  I explained all this to
    the Appellant.

 4. The basis of the Appellant's claim was that she, a Mauritian  national,
    had sought a residence card as the extended family member of her sister-
    in-law, a Lithuanian national married to her brother.

 5. The Appellant came to the UK in 2005. She had leave as a student  which
    finally expired in March 2010. After its expiry she sought a  residence
    card on the same basis as now and was refused.  She  appealed  and  her
    appeal was dismissed. That decision was upheld by the  Upper  Tribunal.
    She then overstayed and submitted the current application on 25th April
    2013. The basis of the application is identical to  that  submitted  in
    May 2010.

 6. The Letter of Refusal in the current application was also on  the  same
    basis as the previous  application,  namely  that  she  had  failed  to
    provide evidence that she had resided with or was financially supported
    by her Sponsor prior to arriving in the UK or since.

 7. At paragraph 3 of the determination the Judge referred to the  previous
    determination (Judge Denson) in which he noted that the evidence of the
    Appellant and  her  brother  contradicted  that  of  the  Sponsor.  The
    Sponsor, the EEA national, gave evidence that she  had  not  maintained
    the Appellant before she came to the UK. In Mauritius the Appellant had
    resided with and was presumably maintained by her parents. Also at that
    time there was found to be insufficient evidence that the EEA  national
    was exercising Treaty rights.

 8. The Judge then described events at the  hearing  before  him  including
    that he had heard evidence from the  Appellant,  her  brother  and  her
    sister-in-law, the EEA national, who was referred to as the Sponsor. At
    paragraph 12 of the determination Judge Cohen said:-

         "The Sponsor  was  a  highly  unimpressive  witness.  She  appeared
         evasive and gave changeable answers. She was hostile. She initially
         indicated that she only supported the Appellant after she  came  to
         the UK and then sought to change evidence that  she  had  supported
         the Appellant in Mauritius and was sent �200-�300  and  then  �100-
         �150 every six months through various relatives".

 9. In the  section of the determination  headed "Decision"   at  paragraph
    16 the Judge said this:-

         "My starting point is  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
         Immigration Judge Denson. He  found  that  the  Appellant  and  her
         brother had given  discrepant  evidence  to  that  of  the  Sponsor
         concerning when financial support started. The former two witnesses
         indicated that financial support from the  Sponsor  started  whilst
         the Appellant was still in Mauritius whereas the Sponsor  indicated
         that it only started once the Appellant  arrived  in  the  UK.  For
         reasons which appear bizarre to  me,  the  Appellant  has  made  an
         identical application only for exactly the same scenario to  unfold
         at the appeal before  me.  The  Appellant  and  her  brother  again
         attempted to  claim  that  financial  support  started  whilst  the
         Appellant was still in  Mauritius  whereas  the  Sponsor  initially
         indicated before me that she only started supporting the  Appellant
         when she arrived in the UK. I find the latter evidence  to  be  the
         truth. I adopt the findings of Immigration  Judge  Denson.  I  find
         that the Appellant was not being supported by the Sponsor when  she
         was in Mauritius and I find that the Appellant's appeal  under  the
         Regulations is bound to fail."

10.  At  paragraph  18  the  Judge  described  the  Sponsor  as  a   highly
    unimpressive witness and that her evidence damaged the  credibility  of
    the appeal as a whole.

11. At paragraph 19 the Judge noted again that the Appellant  had  made  an
    identical application to that which was refused in 2010 with  no  fresh
    evidence and the same discrepancies had arisen again.

12.  At paragraph 20 the Judge indicated that she found the Appellant,  the
    Sponsor and the Appellant's brother lacking  in  credibility  and  that
    they gave substantially discrepant accounts going to the  core  of  the
    appeal. The core finding of the appeal was that the Appellant  did  not
    form part of the Sponsor's household at the  time  that  she  lived  in
    Mauritius and nor was she financially dependant on her  at  that  time.
    The appeal was bound to fail.

13. The Judge then went on to consider Article 8 and gave detailed  reasons
    why removal to Mauritius would not be a disproportionate breach of  the
    Appellant's right to private or family life.

14. The grounds have been settled by Counsel,  although  I  note  different
    counsel from the one who represented at the hearing. Before the  First-
    tier Tribunal the Appellant  was  represented  by  Mr  Skymer  and  the
    grounds settled by Mr Paul Turner.

15. I find the grounds to be at best displaying an ignorance of EEA law and
    at worst misleading.

16. Paragraph 11 of the grounds suggests  that  the  Judge's  reasoning  is
    unclear and that he has not  properly  understood  the  nature  of  the
    appeal before him. That is completely unfounded and not borne out by  a
    scrutiny of the determination. The Judge has grasped the issue  in  the
    appeal completely, namely whether or not the Appellant is the  extended
    family member of her Lithuanian sister-in-law.  Paragraph  12  suggests
    that the Judge had misunderstood the law on the basis that he dismissed
    the appeal because the Appellant was not dependent upon or a member  of
    the household of the EEA national in Mauritius. With respect,  that  is
    the law. Paragraph 13 of the grounds states:-

         "It is submitted that this is not the correct law and that there is
         no obligation that an extended family member have been part of  the
         same household in the non-EU country."

17. The grounds then go on quote what  purports  to  be  the  relevant  law
    namely Regulation 8 of the 2006 Regulations. However, Regulation  8  is
    misquoted. The grounds cite Regulation 8 as follows:-

         "8.---(1) In these Regulations "extended  family  member"  means  a
         person who is  not  a  family  member  of  an  EEA  national  under
         regulation 7 (1) (a), (b) or (c) and who satisfies  the  conditions
         in paragraph (2), (3), (4) or (5).

             (2) A person satisfies the condition in this paragraph if  the
             person is a relative of an EEA national,  his  spouse  or  his
             civil partner and----

             (a) the persons is residing in a EEA State is  dependent  upon
             the EEA national or is a member of his household;

             (b) the person satisfied the condition in paragraph (a) and is
             accompanying the EEA national to the  United Kingdom or wishes
             to join him there: or

             (c) the person satisfied the condition in paragraph  (a),  has
             joined the EEA national in the United Kingdom and continues to
             be dependent upon him or to be a member of his household."




18. I will not recite the remainder of Regulation 8 as it is irrelevant for
    the purpose of this appeal.

19. Regulation 8 however is not as set out in  the  grounds.  Regulation  8
    provides:-


     8.- "Extended family member"
    (1) In these Regulations "extended family member" means a person who is
    not a family member of an EEA national under regulation 7(1)(a), (b) or
    (c) and who satisfies the conditions in paragraph
    (2), (3), (4) or (5).
    (2) A person satisfies the condition in this paragraph if the person is
    a relative of an EEA national, his spouse or his civil partner and-
    (a) the person is residing in  a country other than the United Kingdom
and is
    dependent upon the EEA national or is a member of his household;
    (b) the person satisfied the condition in paragraph (a) and is
accompanying the EEA national
    to the United Kingdom or wishes to join him there; or
    (c) the person satisfied the condition in paragraph (a), has joined the
EEA national in the
    United Kingdom and continues to be dependent upon him or to be a member
    of his household"

20. It is clear therefore that if anybody has failed to grasp the issues in
    the case and apply the correct law it is not First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    but Counsel. In  order  to  bring  herself  within  the  definition  of
    extended family member the Appellant would have to show she was  either
    dependent upon or a member of the household of her Lithuanian sister-in-
    law when in Mauritius. That she has failed to do now twice. The grounds
    do not challenge the finding itself, which  was  clearly  open  to  the
    Judge on the evidence. Contrary to the assertion in  the  grounds,  the
    Judge applied the correct law. The Appellant quite simply does not meet
    the requirements of Regulation 8.

21. The grounds also suggest that the  Judge  failed  to  apply  Devaseelan
    [2003] Imm AR 1 correctly. It is perfectly clear from the  contents  of
    paragraphs 16 and 19 that the Judge did approach Devaseelan  correctly.
    It was the Judge's starting point and as the Judge  pointed  out  there
    was no fresh evidence and no difference in the way  the  case  unfolded
    before him than it had previously.

22. The grounds also suggest that the Judge's approach  to  Article  8  was
    incorrect. Again I can detect no error. As the Judge points out,  while
    the Appellant has been in the UK for some time she  has  no  continuing
    right to be here. She is 33 years of age and in  good  health  and  has
    spent the majority of her life in Mauritius.  There  have  (twice  now)
    been significant credibility findings against her and her  parents  are
    in Mauritius.

23. I therefore find that the grounds upon which permission to  appeal  was
    granted to be wholly without merit. Contrary to what  is  suggested  in
    the grounds the Judge applied the correct law,  gave  adequate  reasons
    and did not misdirect himself with regard to the evidence.

13.  I uphold the determination of the First-tier Tribunal  and  the  appeal
    to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.
