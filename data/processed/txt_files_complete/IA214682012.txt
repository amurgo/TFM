For the Appellant:     No appearance
For the Respondent:    Ms J Isherwood (HOPO)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge D'Ambrosio promulgated on 28th December 2012, following a hearing
    at Glasgow on 11th December 2012.   In  the  determination,  the  judge
    dismissed the appeal of Muhammad Zubair Khan.   The  Appellant  applied
    for, and was granted, permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal,  and
    thus the matter comes before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Pakistan, who was  born  on  12th
    December 1978.  He appeals  against  the  decision  of  the  Respondent
    Secretary of State dated 24th September 2012, to refuse his application
    to remain in the UK as a Tier 1 (Post-Study  Work)  Migrant  under  the
    points-based system, and against  the  decision  to  remove  him  under
    Section 47 of the 2006 Act.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim is that he has a UK recognised degree at  masters
    level in business management.  His certificate  was  awarded  in  April
    2011.  The Respondent was wrong to not award him all the points that he
    claimed (paragraph 22).  His appeal should be allowed.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge found that the Appellant does not rely on  the  bachelors  or
    masters degree or PhD.  He relies upon a postgraduate diploma, which he
    claims is "equivalent to a degree".  The  judge  found  that  this  was
    irrelevant.  The Rules  make  it  quite  clear  that  his  postgraduate
    diploma is not one of the qualifications for  which  he  can  claim  20
    points (see paragraph 14).  The judge also found  that  parliament  was
    entitled to decide that for Tier 1 (Post-Study  Work)  Migrants  points
    are awardable only for precisely those qualifications which  parliament
    considers to be acceptable (paragraph 15).  The appeal was dismissed.

Grounds of Application

 5. The grounds of application state  that  the  Respondent's  decision  to
    remove the Appellant from  the  country  by  way  of  directions  under
    Section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and  Nationality  Act  2006,  was
    wrong.  This is because the Appellant made his application on 4th April
    2012.  This was then refused on 24th September 2012.   Since  then  the
    Appellant has been living under Section 3C of the Immigration Act  1971
    and  then  under  Section  3D  of  the  Immigration  Act   1971.    The
    Respondent's decision, on 24th September 2012, included a  decision  to
    remove the Appellant from the United Kingdom by way of directions under
    Section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and  Nationality  Act  2006.   No
    paragraph 395C  removal  factors  were  addressed  when  the  variation
    decision  was  taken.   Therefore,  it  was  clear  on  a  balance   of
    probabilities that the Respondent's decision was not in accordance with
    the law.  Reliance was placed upon  Ahmadi  (s.47  decision:  validity;
    Sapkota) [2012] UKUT 00147 (IAC).

 6. On 13th March 2013, permission to appeal was granted on  the  basis  of
    the case of Ahmadi [2012] UKUT 00147.

 7. On 8th April 2013, a Rule 24 response was entered to  the  effect  that
    the Respondent concedes that the Section 47 point is such as to  amount
    to a material error in law.  However, "for the avoidance of  doubt  the
    Respondent  does  not  consider  that  other  matters  raised  in   the
    application disclose  a  material  error  in  law  in  respect  of  the
    immigration decision" (see paragraph 4).

The Hearing

 8. At the hearing before me on 17th June 2013, there was no attendance  by
    the Appellant or by a representative  on  his  behalf.   Nor,  was  any
    explanation given for this non-attendance.  On the  other  hand,  Ms  J
    Isherwood, a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer, was in  attendance,
    and she repeated the arguments in the Rule 24  response  of  8th  April
    2013.  The only Grounds of Appeal  were  in  relation  to  Section  47.
    This, however, was conceded  by  the  Respondent  Secretary  of  State.
    There was no challenge to the substantive  decision.   The  substantive
    decision dismissed the Appellant's appeal.  Ms Isherwood  asked  me  to
    allow the appeal with respect to Section 47.

Error of Law

 9. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that I  should  set  aside  that  decision  and  remake  the
    decision (see Section 12(2) of TCEA 2007).  My reasons are as  follows.
    Under Ahmadi [2012]  UKUT  00147,  it  is  clear  that  the  Tribunal's
    decision with respect to Section 47 of the 2006 Act, which decision was
    made at the same time as a substantive decision  by  the  Secretary  of
    State, was wrong  in  law.   The  case  of  Ahmadi  [2012]  UKUT  00147
    establishes that two decisions must be made at  separate  times.   This
    matter is conceded by the Respondent Secretary of State in the Rule  24
    response of 8th April 2013.   Accordingly,  I  allow  the  appeal  with
    respect to the Section 47 decision.  However,  I  dismiss  the  appeal,
    such as it is, against the substantive decision  of  the  Tribunal.   I
    remit this matter back to the  Secretary  of  State  to  make  a  fresh
    Section 47 decision.

Decision

10. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside the decision of
    the original decision.  I remake the decision as follows.  This  appeal
    is allowed with respect to Section 47 of the 2006 Act.  This matter  is
    remitted back to the Secretary of State  for  a  fresh  decision  under
    Section 47 of the 2006 Act.

11. No anonymity order is made.
