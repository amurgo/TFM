                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Traynor, promulgated on 31st May 2018.  In the determination, the
    judge dismissed the appeal of the Appellant,  whereupon  the  Appellant
    subsequently applied for, and was granted, permission to appeal to  the
    Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of India, was born on 31st March  1983,  and
    is a female.  She appealed against the decision of the Respondent dated
    19th October 2017, refusing her application for leave to remain in  the
    UK on human rights grounds, as the spouse of  her  sponsoring  husband,
    [GM].

The Issues

 3. The essential issues in the appeal were the financial circumstances  of
    the sponsoring husband, and his ability to show that he earned  �18,600
    to meet the threshold requirement in such cases.  Second, there was the
    issue in relation to Article 8, particularly given that  the  Appellant
    alleged that she had a child now in this  country,  who  is  a  British
    citizen.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge held that, in an application that was to  be  determined  "on
    the papers" the appeal was before it of practically all  the  necessary
    documentations.  The burden of proof was upon the Appellant.   Equally,
    the Respondent Secretary of State had not furnished  a  bundle  either.
    In the circumstances, the Appellant could not discharge the  burden  of
    proof that was upon her.

Grounds of Application

 5. The grounds  of  application  state  that  the  Appellant's  sponsoring
    husband had twice e-mailed over documents to the Home Office.   He  did
    so first on 31st October 2017 and then he did so again  on  21st  March
    2018.  When he telephoned, the people on the other side were less  than
    helpful.  Then on 4th June 2018 he sent over a recorded delivery set of
    documents  specifically   for   the   attention   of   Judge   Traynor.
    Importantly, the grounds make it clear that six sets of e-mail  bundles
    were e-mailed over, there were six replies  confirming  that  documents
    had been received.  Yet, the judge had come to the conclusion that  the
    necessary bundles had not been furnished.

 6. On 1st August 2018, permission to appeal was granted by the Tribunal on
    the basis that it was arguable that the judge was not in possession  of
    all the requisite papers and  that  unfairness  can  be  seen  to  have
    arisen.

 7. On 25th  September  2018,  a  Rule  24  response  was  entered  by  the
    Respondent Secretary of State to the effect that,

         "the Respondent does not oppose  the  Appellant's  application  for
         permission to appeal and invites  the  Tribunal  to  determine  the
         appeal with a fresh oral (continuance) hearing  to  consider  where
         the Appellant had produced relevant evidence to show that  she  now
         had a child in the United Kingdom, and the effect of  that  on  the
         decision" (see paragraph 2).

Submissions

 8. At the hearing before  me  on  5th  October  2018,  the  Appellant  was
    unrepresented.  However, she entered  the  courtroom  with  her  little
    child, accompanied by her husband, [GM].  He  chose  to  spoke  on  her
    behalf in clear  and  fluent  English.   He  repeated  the  grounds  of
    application.  He submitted that he had more than  once  sent  over  the
    necessary documents, and received confirmation,  and  yet  the  judge's
    decision shows that no documentation  reached  his  desk  when  he  was
    considering the appeal.  For his part, Mr Diwnycz  submitted  that  the
    communication shows the Appellant contacting the  Sheffield  office  of
    the Respondent, and it was unfortunate that the documentation had  gone
    astray.  He relied upon the Rule 24 response and submitted that he  did
    not oppose the Appellant's application for permission to appeal.

Error of Law

 9. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that I should set  aside  the  decision.   I  come  to  this
    conclusion notwithstanding the evidence, which shows the judge to  have
    been at no fault whatsoever in not having the  necessary  documentation
    before him, as it was simply not forwarded to him on the  day  when  he
    considered the appeal "on the papers".  What is clear, however, is that
    the Appellant did send documents over by e-mail on  31st  October  2017
    and then again on 21st March  2018.   That  gave  ample  time  for  the
    documents to be forwarded to the judge for  his  consideration  of  the
    appeal in May.

10. Second, this means that the judge's decision cannot be upheld,  because
    of  the  fundamental  reliance  that  it  places  upon  the   lack   of
    documentation from the Appellant, so as to be unable to  discharge  the
    burden of proof that is upon her.

11. Thus, the judge observes how "the Respondent had failed  to  provide  a
    bundle of documents" and that "in  addition,  it  was  noted  that  the
    Tribunal did not have any of the documents which the Appellant  claimed
    to have sent with a Notice of Appeal ..."  (paragraph  8).   The  judge
    went on to record, that having been handed the papers for the appeal on
    2nd May 2018, "no further documentation had  been  produced  by  either
    party" (paragraph 9).  On this basis, the judge concluded that,

         "notwithstanding the fact that the Respondent has so far failed  to
         comply with the directions to provide a bundle of  those  documents
         which the Appellant supplied in support of the  application,  I  am
         nevertheless  satisfied  that  there  is   sufficient   information
         available to me to enable me to fairly  and  justly  determine  the
         issues in this appeal without further  reference  to  the  parties"
         (paragraph 9).

    In  the  light  of  the  Appellant  having   specifically   sent   over
    documentation, that conclusion, it is now clear, was one  that  led  to
    procedural unfairness for the Appellant.

12. In terms of the findings by  the  judge,  the  judge  was  clear  that,



         "it is not without note that  the  burden  of  proof  is  upon  the
         Appellant to establish upon a balance  of  probabilities  that  the
         Respondent's  decision  in  refusing  her  application  under   the
         Immigration Rules was not  in  accordance  with  those  Rules  ..."
         (paragraph 17).

    Plainly, if the documentation was not forwarded to the  judge  then  he
    was bound to have come to the conclusion that the Appellant had  failed
    to discharge the burden of proof, although that  was  contrary  to  the
    Appellant's own actions where meticulous care had been taken to  ensure
    that documentation was with the judge.

13. In the same way, the judge concluded that "the Appellant  had  provided
    no evidence to show that she was pregnant or any medical  documents  to
    show when her baby was expected" (paragraph 18).  The judge noted  that
    "no evidence has been provided by the Appellant either to confirm  that
    she was pregnant or that she has given birth" (paragraph 18).

14. Thereafter, the judge considered

         "The fundamental reason for refusing the  Appellant's  application,
         namely that it had not  been  established  by  way  of  appropriate
         documentary evidence that the Appellant's husband  earns  at  least
         �18,600 as the minimum income threshold ..." (paragraph 19).

    The Appellant claims that such documentation was indeed sent.

15. Inevitably, with the conclusion that, "the Appellant  elected  for  her
    appeal to be considered on papers and therefore  it  is  all  the  more
    important  that  she  should  submit   the   relevant   and   necessary
    documentation which establishes her circumstances" (paragraph 20),  the
    failure to consider the documentation that had been sent in  compliance
    with the directions by the Appellant, obviously led to a decision  that
    was procedurally unfair to the Appellant.

16. I note that there is a degree of consensus between  the  Appellant  and
    the Respondent Secretary of State, confirmed by Mr Diwnycz today at the
    hearing, that they do  not  oppose  the  appeal.   This  matter  should
    therefore be returned back to the First-tier Tribunal for a hearing  on
    the basis of the documentation that should be looked at.

Notice of Decision

17. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside the decision of
    the original judge.  I remake the decision as follows.  This appeal  is
    allowed under practice statement 7.2(a) because the effect of the error
    has been to deprive a party before the First-tier Tribunal  of  a  fair
    hearing or other opportunity for  that  party's  case  to  be  put  and
    considered by the First-tier Tribunal.  The appeal is to be heard by  a
    judge other than Judge Traynor.

18. No anonymity direction is made.

19. This appeal is allowed.
