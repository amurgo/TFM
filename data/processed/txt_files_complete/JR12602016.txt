applicant appeared in person on 27 April 2017.

Mr colin thomann appeared on behalf of the Respondent at both hearings.


APPROVED JUDGMENT

UTJ GLEESON:  The applicant has permission to challenge by  judicial  review
   the respondent's decision on 5 November 2015  to  revoke  his  indefinite
   leave to remain in the United Kingdom on the grounds  that  he  has  used
   deception.  The applicant is a Bangladeshi citizen: he has  with  him  in
   the United Kingdom his Bangladeshi citizen wife, who still has indefinite
   leave to remain and their child, who was born  here  in  2010  and  is  a
   British citizen.





Background

2. The applicant has been in the United Kingdom since August 2002,  studying
   first for a law degree at  the  University  of  London,  then  the  Legal
   Practice Course, taken at  the  University  of  Thames  Valley  (now  the
   University of West London) with a view to qualifying as a solicitor.  The
   applicant had leave to remain continuously as a student or on  post-study
   leave until 30 September 2012.  All of the applicant's  applications  for
   leave to remain were made before previous leave expired.

3. The deception in question relates  to  the  applicant's  reliance  in  an
   application in January 2012 on an ETS/TOEIC test which he claims to  have
   taken on 15 November 2011 at Elizabeth  College.   The  applicant  relied
   upon that test result to gain his last period of Tier 4  (General)  leave
   on 14 January 2012, which helped to establish the 10-year period he  then
   relied upon when applying for indefinite leave to remain.

4. The respondent considers Elizabeth College to be a  'fraud  factory'  and
   that no test taken there at that time, even where sat in person,  can  be
   regarded as genuine.  It is the applicant's case that his certificate  is
   genuine and that he did attend and take the test personally at  Elizabeth
   College. The applicant was granted indefinite  leave  to  remain  in  the
   United Kingdom in May 2013, along with his wife, and their  daughter  was
   then recognised as a British citizen.   She is 7 years old now.

5. From 2007-2009, when he had post-study leave, the applicant ran  an  OISC
   advice practice, before resuming his studies in 2009, hoping to achieve a
   Masters' degree in Law (LLM).   Those studies were interrupted by  health
   problems, which the applicant describes simply as 'stress', and  when  he
   began again in 2012, the applicant was affected by the tightening of  the
   Rules as to English language competence and qualifications.   His College
   required him to sit an ETS/TOEIC test before they would provide a CAS.

6. The applicant is not a qualified  solicitor,  nor,  presently,  is  he  a
   solicitor in training. He has undertaken  several  post-graduate  diploma
   courses, and a number of unpaid internships with law firms, but  has  not
   been offered a training contract by any of them.  The applicant  ascribes
   this to 'high competition'.

7. The Elizabeth  College  fraud  was  discovered  during  the  respondent's
   Immigration and Intelligence Directorate  Project  Fa�ade  investigation,
   for which an interim report was produced in 2014. On 11 January 2015, the
   applicant came to adverse notice when he was arrested for taxi touting.

8. The respondent's look-up tool identified the applicant as  one  of  those
   who used a 'pilot' or proxy test taker, and his ETS TOEIC certificate was
   withdrawn on that basis. The applicant's indefinite leave to  remain  was
   revoked on 5 November 2015.  He was served with notice of  revocation  of
   indefinite leave and of his liability to removal.  His wife's  indefinite
   leave and his daughter's British citizenship were not affected.

9. On 27 April 2015, the applicant applied for naturalisation as  a  British
   citizen, but failed to respond to two biometric information letters  from
   the  respondent.   On  19  July  2015,   the   respondent's   immigration
   enforcement team attempted to visit him at his home, but could  not  gain
   entry.  On 22  January  2016,  the  respondent  refused  the  applicant's
   application for naturalisation. There is no challenge to the  refusal  of
   naturalisation or to the Article  8  ECHR  element  of  the  respondent's
   decisions.

10. On 18 November 2015, with the  assistance  of  Dynamic  Solicitors,  the
   applicant challenged the revocation of his indefinite  leave  to  remain,
   based upon his Article 8 ECHR private and family life.   The  applicant's
   solicitors served a Pre-Action Protocol letter on 3  December  2015,  and
   the respondent replied, maintaining her decision,  on  7  December  2015.
   The respondent has invited  the  applicant  to  make  a  paid  Article  8
   application, but the applicant has not done so.

11. On 4 February 2016, the applicant, acting  in  person,  issued  judicial
   review proceedings, challenging only the revocation of  indefinite  leave
   to remain.

Permission for judicial review

12. Permission for judicial review was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge  Blum
   at an oral renewal hearing on 4 May 2016 on the basis that:

      "1.   In circumstances where the respondent would have been aware  (i)
      of the criticism levelled against the methodology employed by  ETS  in
      determining whether a proxy tester was used (R on the  application  of
      Gazi v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  (ETS  -  judicial
      review) IJR [2015] UKUT 00327 (IAC)) especially at [8]-[15], and  (ii)
      the applicant's educational background (he was awarded an LLB in  2004
      and completed the Legal Practice Course in 2007), it is arguable  that
      the respondent was required to give the applicant  an  opportunity  to
      make representations prior to her decision to revoke his ILR.

      2.    It is additionally arguable that, in light of the  criticism  in
      Gazi and the fact that the respondent was in possession of the  expert
      report form Dr Harrison since  at  least  March  2015,  there  was  no
      'worthwhile evidence' before the respondent of deception practised  by
      the applicant, and that the respondent was not rationally entitled  to
      conclude  that  the  applicant  exercised  deception,   a   conclusion
      underpinning the challenged decision.

      3.    Although it did not form part of the judicial review grounds the
      Upper Tribunal may  also  wish  to  consider  whether  the  respondent
      lawfully applied section 76(2) of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
      Asylum Act 2002, given that the applicant did not appear  to  rely  on
      his ETS test result in his ILR application, although regard will  need
      to be given to section 7.12 of the ILR application form."

13. Mr Sharma for the applicant accepted that following Abbas, ground  3  is
   unarguable, and it was not pursued at the hearing.

Upper Tribunal hearing

14. The Upper Tribunal is seised therefore only of the question whether  the
   respondent's revocation of the applicant's indefinite leave to remain  in
   the United Kingdom was lawful.  The existence of the Secretary of State's
   power to revoke indefinite leave under section  76  of  the  Nationality,
   Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (as amended) depends on deception  having
   been used. In the light of the decision of Mr Justice  William  Davis  at
   [7] in R on the Application of Abbas v Secretary of State  for  the  Home
   Department [2017] EWHC 78 (Admin), it was common ground  that  the  Upper
   Tribunal is required to make a finding of precedent fact  as  to  whether
   the applicant used deception.

15. This application had previously been adjourned by consent, to await  the
   outcome of a number of relevant Upper Tribunal decisions, which have been
   reported as R on the application of Saha & Another v Secretary  of  State
   for the Home Department (Secretary of State's  duty  of  candour)  [2017]
   UKUT 17 (IAC) (Saha), Mohibullah, R (on the application of)  v  Secretary
   of State  for  the  Home  Department  (TOEIC  -  ETS  -  judicial  review
   principles) [2016] UKUT 561 (IAC)  (Mohibullah),  and  MA  (ETS  -  TOEIC
   testing) Nigeria [2016] UKUT 450 (IAC) (MA (Nigeria)).

16. All of those decisions now having been promulgated, the application  has
   been restored for substantive judicial review.

Evidence

17. The applicant's evidence consists of his witness statement and his  oral
   evidence.  He has not called for the sound files for his test  and  there
   is no independent evidence to show whether he took the test personally.

18. The respondent  relies  on  evidence  which  she  says  shows  that  the
   Elizabeth College ETS/TOEIC testing was a 'fraud factory', as follows:

     a) Project  Fa�ade  -  criminal  inquiry  into  abuse  of  the  TOEIC,
        Elizabeth College, London  (Criminal  Investigations  (Immigration)
        dated 15 May 2015.  This document, prepared by Detective  Inspector
        Andrew Carter of  the  Immigration  and  Enforcement  Criminal  and
        Financial  Investigation  Team,  would   have   been   within   the
        respondent's knowledge when she made her decision in November 2015.

     b) witness statements and supporting documents from Rachel  Green  (17
        February 2017) and Adam Sewell (6 January 2017);

     c) expert evidence from Professor Peter French  (20  April  2016)  and
        Richard Heighway (26 July 2016); and

     d) ETS' responses to questions from the Government  Legal  Department,
        provided on 9 March 2016.

Applicant's evidence

19. The applicant gave oral evidence against a witness statement  signed  on
   Monday 20 March 2017.  He produced further documents at the hearing.   In
   the interests of justice and the overriding  objective,  there  being  no
   objection from Mr Thomann on behalf of the  respondent,  I  admitted  the
   additional evidence and the witness statement.  In his witness statement,
   which the applicant prepared himself, he  gave  his  address  as  "Warnar
   Place, London E2" (in context, Warner Place in Tower  Hamlets).   At  the
   hearing, he adopted his statement and asked that it stand as his evidence
   in chief.

20. The applicant's witness statement reminds  me  that  he  has  cooperated
   with the Rules and apart from the  present  difficulty,  he  has  neither
   overstayed nor been in the United Kingdom without leave at  any  time  in
   the last 15 years.

21. Due to  unspecified  health  issues,  for  which  there  is  no  medical
   evidence before me, the applicant did not complete his  LLM  examinations
   as originally planned.  He deferred them to  July/August  2012,  and  was
   caught by the change in the Rules in July 2012,  such  that  the  College
   where he wished to study then required a certificate of English  language
   competence.  The applicant had studied in English since arriving 10 years
   earlier, but had never previously been required to take a language  test.



22. The applicant was living in Bow, London E3 and he searched  for  a  test
   centre on the internet.  In the final week of October 2011, the applicant
   selected Elizabeth College in Stewart's Road, SW8, about 10 minutes' walk
   from Vauxhall Underground Station, and 40 minutes to 1 hour from his home
   in Bow.  In his oral evidence, the applicant  accepted  that  there  were
   other testing centres,  much  nearer  his  home,  which  had  test  dates
   available in December 2011.

23. The applicant described his two visits to the College, the first to  pay
   his fee in cash, and the second to sit the test, in his witness statement
   at [11]-[15]:

      "11.  The College was at First Floor.  Sign Board was  placed  outside
      the building.  I went up-stair and spoke to the  receptionist.   There
      were persons working as receptionist.  There was a que  [sic]  at  the
      receipt [sic] and 2 people were already waiting  for  call.   A  white
      girl called me.  She checked my Passport (ID documents) and  proof  of
      address from the bank statement.  She took copy of  my  documents  and
      asked to complete registration form which I did.  Afterward, she asked
      for fee which I paid for the sum of �175 in cash. She given me receipt
      for the payment and booked my test for 15 November 2011.

      12    On 15 November 2011, I west [sic] to the  College  for  test  at
      9.30.  I reported at the reception.  I was asked to confirm name, date
      of birth, address and test ID.  I was asked to wait.  There were about
      9-10 other test takers/students.

      13.   There were 2 parts in the test.  Each part has  2  modules.  1st
      part was for speaking and writing test and 2nd part was listening  and
      reading test.

      14.   I was sent to a room to do the listening and  reading  test.   I
      was given headphone with speaker.  The test was computer based.  First
      part took place in the  morning  session  and  the  2nd  part  in  the
      afternoon.

      15.   After 20 days I received my Test Certificate which I provided to
      my College (London East Bank College). ...

      21.   I confirm under oath that I have never exercised [sic] deception
      or misrepresentation.  The Home Office has revoked my indefinite leave
      to remain without giving me an opportunity to explain my position.

      22.   I request the immigration judge to kindly order the Home  Office
      for the reinstatement of my Indefinite Leave to remain as my  life  is
      on hold and I am caused undue mental distress, depression and anxiety.
       My career is destroyed because I could  not  pursue  for  a  Training
      Contract to qualify as a Solicitor of England and Wales  for  which  I
      have invested huge amount of money, efforts, time and hard work."

24. The applicant was tendered for  cross-examination.   His  oral  evidence
   was given very quietly, and I had to ask him to speak up  several  times.
   Sometimes, it seemed that he  misunderstood  the  question,  as  he  gave
   answers which would  have  been  appropriate  for  a  different  question
   altogether.  I reframed the question (sometimes twice) and the  appellant
   then answered it. The following is a summary of the evidence he  gave  in
   cross-examination.

25. The applicant confirmed that he had lived in Bangladesh until he was  35
   years old, and that English is not his first  language,  as  is  apparent
   from some grammatical infelicities in his witness statement (see above).

26. The applicant confirmed that he  had  not  previously  sat  any  English
   language examinations nor been tested  for  his  language  competence  in
   English.  His University of London LLB studies were undertaken at Holborn
   College,  which  provided  tuition.   He  attended  Holborn  College  for
   lectures.  He obtained his  qualification  on  the  basis  of  a  written
   examination only.  The applicant had not disclosed to the respondent, nor
   had he brought with him for the  Upper  Tribunal  hearing,  the  academic
   transcript showing the detail of the marks  achieved  when  he  took  his
   Masters degree.  The applicant said he had it at home.

27. The applicant did bring to the Upper Tribunal hearing a number of  other
   previously undisclosed  academic  records  which,  in  the  interests  of
   justice and without objection from Mr Thomann, were  exchanged  over  the
   short adjournment and admitted as bundle 3. They  confirm  that  in  July
   2007, the applicant obtained a Post-Graduate Diploma  in  Legal  Practice
   from Thames  Valley  University  in  July  2007,  which  he  passed  with
   distinction.

28. The applicant stated that during the period 2007-2009,  when  he  had  a
   post-study work visa, he had a practice as an OISC  immigration  adviser.
   In 2009, he began his LLM studies and was no longer entitled to  work  in
   that role, so he closed his OISC practice.  The applicant  said  that  he
   had been unable to complete the LLM because of health problems, but  when
   pressed, he simply cited 'stress' as the problem.  There was  no  medical
   evidence to support his assertion  that  he  was  not  medically  fit  to
   complete his studies until 2012.

29. The applicant asserted under cross-examination that  the  revocation  of
   his indefinite leave to remain had prevented  him  obtaining  a  training
   contract enabling him to qualify as a solicitor.  When it was pointed out
   to the applicant that his indefinite leave was not granted until May 2013
   and was revoked in November 2015, the applicant  corrected  his  evidence
   and accepted that the revocation of his indefinite leave had  nothing  to
   do with his inability to obtain a  solicitors'  training  contract.   The
   applicant was disappointed; he felt that the firms had taken advantage of
   him, giving him hope without any real intention of providing  a  training
   contract.

30. The applicant was asked about the process which  led  to  his  selecting
   Elizabeth College for his English language test,  in  October  2011.   He
   said that he needed an English language qualification at Level B2  before
   his leave expired on 15 January 2012.  The applicant  explained  that  he
   had approached several providers of English language qualifications,  and
   that certainly, there had been providers nearer to his home in  Bow  than
   Elizabeth College, which was in Vauxhall, a journey of 40  minutes  to  1
   hour by underground and on foot.

31.  The  applicant's  evidence  at  this  point   was   confusing   as   he
   misunderstood the question and it had to be repeated several times.   His
   evidence, when clarified, was  that  the  dates  which  the  East  London
   centres could offer were  for  tests  in  late  December  2011.   He  was
   concerned that the  result  would  not  come  through  in  time  for  his
   application which had to be in by 15 January 2012 at the latest.

32. The applicant visited Elizabeth College a few weeks before he  took  his
   test, and paid in cash.  He has never disclosed the receipt, but  claimed
   in his evidence that he still had it at home.  He thought the amount  was
   �175. It had not occurred to him to pay by  cheque,  card  or  BACS,  and
   Elizabeth College had not suggested that to him.

33. Mr Thomann put to the applicant that the real reason  he  had  travelled
   nearly an hour from  his  home,  to  pay  the  fee  and  produce  his  ID
   documents, was that he was arranging with Elizabeth College for  a  proxy
   test taker and that a cash payment was essential, so that there should be
   no record of the amount paid.  The question was  asked  twice,  and  each
   time the applicant appeared to respond to a different question from  that
   which was asked:  the first time, he said, 'No, they said it  would  take
   15-20 days for the certificate after the examination'.  The second  time,
   asked directly whether the payment was in cash so that there was no trace
   of paying the proxy test taker, the applicant said that he did  not  know
   why he had paid in cash:  Elizabeth College had not asked him  for  cash,
   he just paid that way.

34.  The applicant said he had attended Elizabeth  College  on  15  November
   2011 and sat the  test  personally.   He  had  no  recollection  of  what
   questions were asked.  The applicant said he had noticed nothing untoward
   at the centre.  He only knew that he had personally taken the  test,  and
   that others did so at the same time. The applicant's  evidence  was  that
   there were 9 or 10 other candidates  there  on  15  November  2011.   The
   applicant was shown the respondent's look-up tool which  showed  that  65
   people had attended each session  on  that  day.   He  then  changed  his
   answer, saying that he meant that there were 10 people in the room  where
   he took the test, including him.  That answer is inconsistent  both  with
   his witness statement, which described 10 people  waiting  in  reception,
   and his immediately preceding oral evidence.

35. Mr Thomann put to the applicant  that  Elizabeth  College  was  a  fraud
   factory, organising proxy test takers for those who  were  nervous  about
   not getting the desired outcome from the test.  The applicant said he did
   not know that.  He had confidence that he could do the test himself.   He
   was asked to confirm that English was his second language:  the applicant
   responded that he had confidence that he could do the  test  himself.   I
   asked him to answer the question and he confirmed that  English  was  his
   second language.  He said everyone made mistakes in  their  English,  but
   all the courses he had taken were in English.

36. Mr Thomann put  to  the  applicant  that  the  English  in  his  witness
   statement was peppered with grammatical errors: the applicant said he was
   stressed and ill when preparing it.  I asked him  what  illness  he  had:
   the applicant said, he meant that he was stressed.

37. The applicant was asked why he and his representatives  had  not  called
   for the voice recording of his test, which was available  from  ETS.   He
   said:

      "I didn't think so I need it.  I was unaware and I didn't ask for  the
      voice recording.  I sat the test myself.  I did  sit  the  examination
      myself sir."

38. Mr Thomann put to the applicant that  he  had  produced  no  receipt  or
   supporting evidence to confirm that he had taken the test personally, and
   that, in fact, it was not he who sat the test that  day.   The  applicant
   said he did not know who to call to find out.  He continued:

      "You see the College what happened, why is happened this, I forgot  to
      write about going back to the College."

   Mr Thomann concluded his cross-examination by putting  to  the  applicant
   that it was untrue that he went to Elizabeth College on 15  November  and
   sat the examination.  The applicant replied that it was true.

39. In re-examination, Mr Sharma confirmed with the applicant  that  he  had
   worked as an OISC adviser until 2009, during the period when he had Post-
   Study Leave.  In 2009,  he registered as an LLM student and  stopped  his
   OISC practice.  The applicant said there was  no  particular  reason,  he
   just wanted to study further.  He had brought money over from  Bangladesh
   at that time to enable him to  continue  his  studies.   He  had  already
   passed the LLB and the LPC, both of which were taught  in  English.   The
   applicant was now unsure whether, in fact, he had the College receipt  as
   he had stated earlier in his evidence: he had changed many things.

Respondent's evidence

Project Fa�ade

40. The respondent in her decision relied on the  May  2015  Project  Fa�ade
   report, a  nationwide  Home  Office  criminal  undertaken  following  the
   February 2014  Panorama  investigation,  which  identified  a  number  of
   colleges  and  test  centres  which  had  corrupted  the  TOEIC  process,
   including allowing proxy test takers. The Project Fa�ade report explained
   that the Home Office entered into a licence agreement with ETS  in  April
   2011, to provide English language  testing  for  certain  types  of  visa
   applicants. ETS Global then entered into  agreements  with  a  number  of
   private test centres, as well as administering tests  overseen  by  their
   own staff at 2 secure public test centres.

41. The Project Fa�ade review comprised 21 separate criminal  investigations
   into specific test centres, prioritised according to a number of factors,
   including high test volumes, audits which highlighted cheating, and other
   intelligence  and  information  indicating  widespread   abuse   of   the
   examination. The report makes clear that it is an interim report and that
   the criminal investigations into ETS/TOEIC test centres were ongoing.

42. ETS' own investigation used voice analysis software, corroborated  by  2
   human  assessors,  and  identified  33725  invalid   scores   and   22694
   questionable scores.  In contrast, at ETS Global's public test centres in
   Bloomsbury and Westminster, between 11 April 2011 and  9  February  2014,
   there  were  1039  tests,  of  which  3  were  found  invalid  and   none
   questionable. In the majority of the private test centres, the  level  of
   cheating was high. In some private test centres, thousands of tests  were
   invalidated: in one centre, 88% of the results were rated 'invalid'.

43. Between 18 October 2011 and 26 September  2012,  Elizabeth  College  had
   administered 2919 TOEIC speaking and writing tests.  ETS identified  2074
   (69%)  results  as  invalid  and  1845  (31%)  as  questionable.   Audits
   conducted at the centre reflected widespread cheating:  one invalid  test
   taker admitted having used a proxy; the ETS auditor identified a  suspect
   proxy sitting a test during the  audit  visit;  and  financial  enquiries
   established that payments from six TOEIC candidates, well  in  excess  of
   the test fee, were made into a named director's account.

44. None of the Elizabeth College results were accepted as  genuine.    None
   of the ETS  voice  samples  checked  against  the  voices  of  candidates
   interviewed under caution was a match.

Mr Adam Sewell

45. Adam Sewell is the lead  Home  Office  Analyst  in  relation  to  Secure
   English Language Testing  analyst  since  February  2014.   He  has  been
   responsible for collating,  analysing  and  presenting  data  within  the
   respondent's Immigration and Intelligence Directorate in Sheffield, since
   13 January 2014.

46. Mr Sewell's statement, dated 6 January 2017,  introduced  and  explained
   the updated Home Office Elizabeth College report he prepared  in  January
   2017, the conclusions of which were that:

      "Key Judgements
      1.    The majority of tests at Elizabeth College  were  not  conducted
           under genuine test conditions.
      2.    The results  reported  by  Elizabeth  College  are  not  a  true
           reflection of the English ability of the candidates."

47. The January 2017 paper  stated  that  Elizabeth  College  operated  8410
   TOEIC tests between 18 October 2011 and 29  September  2012,  which  were
   compared to those of Pearson Test Centres, which the respondent considers
   is an organisation conducting genuine tests. Candidates were recorded  by
   Elizabeth College as having English language ability at the higher end of
   the score range, consistent with those of candidates at other TOEIC  test
   centres where abuse was known to  have  taken  place,  and  significantly
   better than those at Pearson test centres.

48. Proxy test takers had now been identified by ETS  at  Elizabeth  College
   in 201 of the 2014 speaking and writing sessions, indicating  that  abuse
   was widespread and occurred throughout the entire period  that  Elizabeth
   College offered TOEIC tests.  As regards listening and reading tests, the
   summary says this:

      "8.   Analysis of listening and  reading  test  results  at  Elizabeth
      College shows several abnormal patterns that are not  consistent  with
      tests conducted under genuine test conditions.  Some of these patterns
      are extreme and can only be attributed to the deliberate  manipulation
      of test results.  The  batching  and  clustering  of  results  towards
      specific areas of the score range that correspond to the  requirements
      of immigration rules indicates that results were manipulated in  order
      to  provide  candidates  with  the  scores  that  they  required   for
      immigration purposes.

      9.    These concerns were not limited to a small  number of individual
      candidates but were  widespread  throughout  the  entire  period  that
      Elizabeth College test centre was offering TOEIC tests."

49. The summary is supported by graphs illustrating  the  results  obtained:
   the difference between the Pearson and the Elizabeth College test results
   is striking, with the Pearson College results  being  distributed  across
   all grades, but the Elizabeth College grades focused only on those grades
   which would meet the respondent's English language  requirements  of  160
   points (the applicant scored 160 too).  Appended to Mr Sewell's report is
   a detailed day by day summary of the test sessions at Elizabeth  College.
   On 15 November 2011, when the applicant claims to have  taken  his  test,
   there were 4 sessions:  two groups of 65 sat Speaking and Writing  tests,
   and two groups of 26 and 45 sat Listening  and  Reading.   On  any  view,
   there were more than 9 or 10 people at the test centre that day.

50. The Elizabeth College evidence and Mr Sewell's reliability as a  witness
   were considered by the Upper Tribunal in Saha at [58]-[59]:

      "(57)       In his statement Mr Sewell describes himself as an Analyst
      within the  Home  Office  Immigration  and  Intelligence  Directorate.
      Through  questioning  we  satisfied  ourselves   about   Mr   Sewell's
      credentials to give the evidence contained in his statement. We accept
      that from February 2014 he has had the designation of Lead Analyst  in
      relation to Secure English Language Testing ("SELT"), following  which
      he  completed  his  training  in  Government   intelligence   analysis
      techniques.

      (58)       Since February 2014, Mr Sewell and the members of the  team
      which he leads have been engaged in analysing  data  provided  to  the
      Home Office by ETS.  His  witness  statement  contains  the  following
      especially material passage:

           " Wider analysis of tests conducted  by  the  Elizabeth  College
           Test Centre and the results of voice analysis conducted by [ETS]
           reveals that there  was  widespread  abuse  of  testing  by  the
           Elizabeth  College  Test  Centre.   Multiple   candidates   that
           reportedly sat speaking and writing tests at the  same  time  in
           the same classroom as the Applicant were  deemed  to  have  used
           proxy test takers by [ETS]  .  This  shows  that  the  Elizabeth
           College Test  Centre  was  not  operating  genuine  tests  under
           genuine test conditions at the time that the Applicant claims to
           have undertaken [his] tests. Therefore none of the results  from
           these test sessions could be  considered  genuine  even  if  the
           candidate had sat the test in person." ...

      (59)       Having subjected Mr Sewell's evidence to  careful  scrutiny
      we  find  no  reason  to  reject  any  of   its   essential   tenets."
                             [Emphasis added]

Rachel Green's evidence

51.  Rachel  Green  is  a  Senior  Executive  Officer  in  the  respondent's
   Litigation Operations, and a Team Manager with management  responsibility
   for two case-working teams.  Ms Green has worked for  the  respondent  in
   that capacity at Lunar House in  Croydon  since  November  2006.   Before
   that, she was an asylum  caseworker,  charged  with  interviewing  asylum
   claimants and making decisions on their claims.  Ms Green has  worked  in
   Asylum Processes, in which capacity she produced  instructions  for  UKVI
   staff.

52. Since November 2016, Ms Green has been the Central Lead on ETS  for  the
   respondent's Appeals, Litigation and Subject Access Directorate (ALS), in
   which role she coordinates the respondent's ETS handling  strategy.   Her
   witness statement dated 17 February 2017  is  directed  at  enabling  the
   Upper Tribunal to understand  how  evidence  of  an  invalid  TOEIC  test
   result, obtained from ETS, is obtained via what the respondent  describes
   as her 'revised look-up tool'.

53. The revised lookup tool was  developed  in  April  2016,  following  the
   hearing in SM and  Qadir,  and  is  an  Excel  spreadsheet  enabling  the
   respondent to search a list of thousands of test certificates provided by
   ETS, by date, test  centre,  morning  or  afternoon,  total  tests  at  a
   particular test centre, and by 'count and %' which shows  the  number  of
   tests which ETS designated as 'released' (deemed  reliable  or  valid  by
   ETS), questionable, or  invalid,  and  as  a  percentage  of  the  total.
   Finally, there are average test scores which Ms  Green  says  'shows  the
   mean average [sic] of all the scores from  the  selected  data'.  All  of
   these analyses are of ETS' assessment of the testing.

54. Annexed to Ms Green's statements at Annex A are  a  full  screenshot  of
   the revised look up tool.  Annex  B  is  a  percentage  analysis  of  the
   results for 15 November 2011 at Elizabeth College, the date the applicant
   claims to have attended his test. Annex C shows the detailed results  for
   15 November 2011, bringing up all the test results for that time and that
   day at Elizabeth College.

55. The results are stark.  Annex A is merely illustrative.  Annex  B  shows
   that there are 0 'released' results at Elizabeth College for 15  November
   2015; 103 questionable, and 27 invalid, which is 27%  of  all  the  tests
   taken that day.  The average test scores  on  that  day  were  153.9  for
   speaking and 160.2 for writing.

ETS responses (Jones Day solicitors)

56. The respondent in these proceedings is engaged in  litigation  with  ETS
   and she produces a schedule of responses to questions she  has  posed  to
   ETS via their solicitors, Jones Day.  The covering letter does  not  make
   it  clear  whether  those  answers  were  obtained  in  the  respondent's
   proceedings against ETS or for the purpose of the present proceedings.

57. The answers given go to the process of reviewing recorded  voice  files,
   and the training of the reviewers.  At [20], Jones Day say that:

      "...the voice files are automatically linked to the  personal  details
      that are entered onto the computer at the start of the test and  coded
      accordingly.  There is no ability for the  test  centre  to  make  any
      amendments to those responses.  As such, the voice  files  of  a  test
      taker cannot be submitted as the speaking test of another individual."



58. At [22], the firm responds that there was  no  expected  false  negative
   rate and no benchmarks.

Expert evidence

59. The headline conclusion in the Project Fa�ade paper was that between  18
   October 2011 and 26 September 2012, which  includes  the  date  when  the
   applicant  claims  to  have  sat  his  test,  there  was  'organised  and
   widespread' abuse of TOEIC testing at Elizabeth College.  In  particular,
   of those ETS voice  samples  which  were  compared  with  the  voices  of
   candidates interviewed under caution,  not one  matched,  suggesting  the
   use  of  proxy  test  takers.   The  Project  Fa�ade  report  noted  that
   'financial enquiries had established' that 6 candidates had  paid  monies
   well in excess of the test fee into  a  named  director's  account.   One
   taker of an 'invalid' test had admitted using  a  proxy  test  taker  and
   named the agent.

JP French Associates

60. The bundles contain two reports from JP  French  Associates,  the  first
   dated 5 February 2015 by Dr Philip Harrison, and the second,  17  January
   2017, by Professor Peter  French.   In  JP  French's  website,  the  firm
   describes itself thus:

      "J  P  French  Associates  is  the   country's   longest   established
      independent forensic speech and acoustics laboratory.  We are  experts
      in forensic voice analysis, transcription,  authentication  and  audio
      enhancement, as well as providing a number of  other  forensic  speech
      and audio services.  Our experience in producing  reports  and  giving
      evidence is unrivalled in the UK.  In criminal cases, we work for both
      prosecution and defence.  We also provide advice and training services
      to law enforcement agencies and lawyers across the world."

61. Dr Philip Harrison (BEng MA  PhD  MIOA),  who  wrote  the  2015  report,
   describes himself as is a forensic consultant, specialising in the  areas
   of acoustics, phonetics and the analysis of  evidential  recordings.   He
   has worked at J P French Associates for 18 years  and  has  expertise  in
   authentication, enhancement, transcription  and  speaker  comparison.  He
   carries out research in the fields of forensic speech and audio analysis:
   in the efficacy of acoustic analysis software, measuring the  performance
   of biometric systems and evaluating methods for expressing  the  strength
   of forensic speech evidence.

62. At [7], under the heading Summary and  Conclusions,  Dr  Harrison  noted
   that  false  positive  errors  can  occur  in  automated  systems,  where
   recordings from two tests may  be  identified  as  being  from  the  same
   speaker,  when  in  fact  they  are  different  speakers.  Dr    Harrison
   continued:

      "At the level of principle, the overall method  [of  auditory-acoustic
      phonetic comparisons] is a reasonable approach, given the magnitude of
      the task.  However, there is  a  lack  of  technical  information  and
      detail within the statements of Mr Millington  and  Ms  Collings  [the
      respondent's witnesses in  SM  and  Qadir],  concerning  the  specific
      implementation. That means that  it  is  not  possible  adequately  to
      scrutinise the method or assess its overall reliability.   Also  there
      is no explicit acknowledgment that the human verification method  -and
      therefore the overall exercise - is almost certain to have resulted in
      false positive results. ...

      In conclusion:

     1.  Given  the  large  number  of  [TOEIC]  tests  examined,  and  the
        limitations of both automatic and human speaker comparison methods,
        it is almost certain that the set of verified  match  results  from
        ETS will contain false positive errors;

     2. Insufficient information has been provided to allow  an  assessment
        of the likely reliability of the method employed  by  ETS  and  the
        potential number of false positive results;

     3. Making recordings available from tests in which  concern  has  been
        raised about the accuracy of the result  would  allow  them  to  be
        subject to  independent  scrutiny  via  auditory-acoustic  phonetic
        speaker comparison analysis."

63. Professor Peter French (BEd, BLing, PhD, FRSA, FIOA)  describes  himself
   as an experienced expert in the field of forensic  speech  and  acoustics
   and chairman of J P French Associates.  He has worked in the field for 30
   years and, as well  as  carrying  out  research,  has  been  involved  in
   implementing quality regulation and  accreditation  for  forensic  speech
   science. In his 20 April 2016 report, considered and accepted in Saha  in
   January 2017, the summary of Professor French's opinion  is  set  out  at
   [4]:

      "4.   Conclusions
           1. The conditions used for trained listener  pair  confirmation,
              in conjunction with  the  (albeit  unspecified)  conservative
              thresholds  set  for  ASR   match   identification   (witness
              statement of Peter Millington, paragraph 31),  would,  in  my
              view, have resulted in substantially  more  false  rejections
              [of the proxy server allegation] than false positives.
           2. Even though there is still material missing from the body  of
              information called for by Dr Harrison,  I  am  not  convinced
              that the provision of  such  information  could  be  used  to
              establish a closely specified percentage of false positives.
           3. If  the  2%  error  rate  established  for  the  TOEFL  pilot
              recordings were to apply to  the  TOEIC  recordings,  then  I
              would estimate  the  rate  of  false  positives  to  be  very
              substantially less than 1% after the process of assessment by
              trained listeners had been applied.  ...
           4. Even if the TOEIC recordings were on average somewhat shorter
              and poorer in quality than the TOEFL pilot  test  recordings,
              on the basis of the information that  has  been  provided,  I
              would still estimate the number of false positives  emanating
              from  the  overall  process  of  ASR  analysis  followed   by
              assessment by two trained listeners to be very small."

Kroll Ontrack Legal Technologies Limited:  Mr Richard Heighway's report

64. A report from Mr Richard Heighway of Kroll  Ontrack  Legal  Technologies
   Ltd (Kroll)  is  headed  'strictly  private  and  confidential'  and  was
   prepared for MA's case.  I have seen no evidence that either Mr  Heighway
   or Kroll have been approached to give permission for this  report  to  be
   reused in unrelated proceedings, for which presumably no  additional  fee
   has been paid.

65. At [19], in the Conclusions to the Kroll report, Mr  Heighway's  opinion
   is  that  it  would  be  extremely  difficult  to  manipulate  the  audio
   recordings of a candidate, either deliberately or accidentally.  He  sums
   up thus:

      "19.1.19    With the information available  to  me,  I  conclude  that
      without a highly  computer  literate  person  being  involved,  it  is
      unlikely that the TOEIC system would attribute a genuine test  taker's
      recording to a different candidate, or that  a  genuine  test  taker's
      recording would be submitted by multiple candidates."

Professor Peter Sommer

66. Professor Peter Sommer is Professor of Digital  Evidence  at  Birmingham
   City University and a Visiting Professor at de Montfort  University.   He
   has previously been both a visiting  Senior  Research  Fellow  and  later
   visiting Professor at the London School of  Economics,  and  has  held  a
   Visiting Readership at the Open University.

67. He gave evidence to the Home Affairs  Committee  on  30  December  2016,
   having been instructed in June 2016  by  Bindmans  LLP  on  behalf  of  a
   client, Mohammed Mohibullah, who was challenging  by  judicial  review  a
   decision regarding an ETS/TOEIC test at Synergy  College  which  ETS  had
   designated as invalid. Mr Sommer and two other experts in that case  were
   instructed to seek to agree a joint report,  and  did  so.   The  experts
   identified a number of possible fraudulent methods:

         . impersonation by a 'pilot' or proxy at the test centre, probably
           assisted by test centre staff to waive the required procedures;
         . use of remote  control  software,  a  method  discovered  during
           Project Fa�ade, an investigation into Elizabeth College, whereby
           the candidate appeared in person, but using TeamViewer,  control
           of his test response was exercised in another room  by  a  proxy
           test taker.  As TeamViewer allows control of the host  computer,
           the proxy could be anywhere in the world that  had  an  internet
           connection;
         . misleading data input by test centre  staff  or  associates,  or
           human error by staff;
         . file manipulation, where computer records are changed by  direct
           intervention by test centre staff or associates, either  on  the
           client  or  the  management  computer,  such   that   fraudulent
           information was supplied to ETS.

68. The principal  conclusions  in  the  Sommer  evidence,  in  relation  to
   processes at Synergy College, are at [21]-[23] in his report:

      "21.  We identified a number of relatively simple security precautions
      that could have been taken by ETS to reduce the  risk  of  local  test
      centre fraud:  the use of live webcam verification, the use of a  live
      video camera in the examination room, and the arbitrary testing of the
      Client and Management computers for absence of modification.

      22.   It is important to stress that because  of  the  lapse  of  time
      between the questioned events and our inquiries as  experts,  a  great
      deal of information, including that on computers at the test  centres,
      was no longer available.  Moreover, we saw some resistance from ETS in
      supplying, via its London solicitors,  information  which  we  thought
      might exist.

      23.   I am not able to say, based on the information available to  me,
      that any fraudulent behaviour definitely took  place,  still  less  to
      point to a precise method.  However, I understand that  various  forms
      of fraud including the use of proxies have been clearly established in
      a number of cases and that these involved activities by test  centres.
      There seems to be every  reason  to  suspect  that  other  techniques,
      including those computer-related ones referred to  above,  could  have
      occurred."

69. Professor Sommer considered  that  the  respondent  had  not  given  the
   excluded candidates a chance to  query  their  results,  and  had  placed
   considerable  pressure  on  the  educational   institutions   where   the
   candidates were registered.  His opinion was that the respondent had  not
   tested the reliability of the information ETS  supplied  to  her  and  on
   which her decisions were based, and that an opportunity should have  been
   given to the affected persons to retake  a  sound,  reliable,  TOEIC-like
   test once the unreliability of their test results was known.

Submissions

70. For the respondent, Mr Thomann relied on  his  skeleton  argument.   The
   chronology in this application was not in dispute.   The  respondent  had
   revoked the applicant's indefinite leave because she considered  that  on
   15 November 2011, he had caused a proxy test taker to take and  pass  his
   speaking and writing test at Elizabeth College. That decision  was  borne
   out by the evidence available to the respondent now as to  how  Elizabeth
   College  operated,  including  specific  evidence   about   the   present
   applicant.

71. Mr Thomann suggested that the  applicant's  evidence  as  given  at  the
   hearing in the Upper Tribunal was  consistent  with  that  of  a  nervous
   candidate who might well  have  feared  failing  a  genuine  test.    His
   written and oral evidence had been littered  with  grammatical  mistakes,
   and he had never previously sat an English  examination.   The  applicant
   was just 8 months away from being able to apply for indefinite leave  and
   there was a great deal riding on the outcome of a test which would enable
   him to bridge that with a further period  of  study.   The  appeal  of  a
   guaranteed pass  might  be  strong  in  such  circumstances,  whatever  a
   candidate's actual English language ability.

72. In October 2011, when the applicant  began  making  enquiries  about  an
   English language test, he only had two and a  half  months  left  of  his
   leave to remain before he needed to  renew.   The  applicant  lived  near
   several local test centres, and Mr Thomann suggested that his  choice  to
   travel to Vauxhall from Bow, taking almost an hour, was inexplicable  and
   unnecessary if he proposed to sit a genuine test.

73. Further, the applicant had travelled across London to Elizabeth  College
   to make a cash payment in advance, allegedly  for  the  examination  fee.
   There might be many reasons for his doing that, but Mr Thomann  submitted
   that it was another indication consistent with a fraudulent  transaction.
   The Tribunal should consider that the journey may well have been made  to
   pay additional sums in  cash  for  the  'pilot'  proxy  test  taker:  the
   applicant had not produced a receipt for  the  cash  payment,  and  there
   would be no electronic record of the actual sum paid.

74. Mr Thomann reminded me that the applicant had not sought to support  his
   account by asking for the ETS voice recordings, from which he could  have
   proved (if such was indeed the case) that he had taken the test  himself.
   The applicant was unable to remember any of  the  questions  set  in  the
   test, despite having a detailed  (but  inaccurate)  recollection  of  the
   number of people at the test centre, the reception area,  and  so  forth.
   That was a marked contrast to which the Tribunal  should  attach  weight.
   The applicant's evidence was that he had noticed nothing untoward on  the
   day of the test, despite the high levels of fraud which had  subsequently
   been found to exist at Elizabeth College.

75. Additionally, Mr Thomann  submitted  that  the  Upper  Tribunal  in  the
   present case was entitled to rely on the finding in  Saha  that  no  one,
   whether they sat their TOEIC test at the College or  used  a  proxy  test
   taker, should be regarded as having gained a genuine qualification.

76. Applying the ordinary civil standard  of  proof,  Mr  Thomann  submitted
   that the Tribunal was entitled to conclude that it was more  likely  than
   not that the applicant did not sit the test and that his  account  was  a
   fabrication. Overall,  Mr  Thomann  submitted  that  the  respondent  had
   discharged the burden on her of showing that the precedent fact  required
   to trigger section 76 of the 2002 Act was present.

77. Turning to the decisions in the lead cases, for which  this  application
   had been held back, Mr Thomann referred to  the  decision  of  the  UTIAC
   President, Mr Justice McCloskey in MA at [57]:

      "(57)       Second, we acknowledge the suggestion that  the  Appellant
      had no reason to engage in the deception which we have  found  proven.
      However, this has not deflected us in any way from reaching  our  main
      findings and conclusions. In the abstract, of course, there is a range
      of reasons why persons proficient  in  English  may  engage  in  TOEIC
      fraud. These include, inexhaustively,  lack  of  confidence,  fear  of
      failure, lack of time and commitment and contempt for the  immigration
      system. These reasons could conceivably overlap  in  individual  cases
      and there is scope for other explanations  for  deceitful  conduct  in
      this sphere. We are not required to make the further  finding  of  why
      the Appellant engaged in deception and to this we add that this  issue
      was not explored during the  hearing.  We  resist  any  temptation  to
      speculate about this discrete matter."

78. There was nothing unusual  or  untoward  in  the  immigration  decision-
   making context in a decision being made on  deception  on  the  documents
   alone, without an interview or a hearing.  In relation to the applicant's
   allegation that it was procedurally unfair for  the  respondent  to  have
   revoked his indefinite leave without giving  him  an  opportunity  to  be
   heard, that issue was academic if the Tribunal found,  having  heard  the
   applicant and all the evidence today, that the precedent fact, deception,
   was proved.  Even if the decision were remade on this ground  alone,  the
   outcome would be the same on the ample evidence of fraud now  before  the
   Tribunal and in the respondent's possession.  Nothing would be gained  by
   quashing the decision on that basis.

79.  The  respondent's  door  remained  open   to   further   material   and
   submissions, including human rights submissions.   She  had  demonstrated
   that already, by being prepared to reconsider her position following  the
   applicant's Pre-Action Protocol letter.

Applicant's submissions

80. Mr Sharma for the applicant  relied  on  his  skeleton  argument.    The
   question for the Upper Tribunal in deciding on  whether  deception  as  a
   precedent fact had been proved was to be decided to  the  ordinary  civil
   standard of balance of probabilities.  The applicant  would  rely  on  PS
   (paragraph 320 (11) discretion:   care  needed)  India  [2010]  UKUT  440
   (IAC), albeit that decision dealt with an entirely different context;  on
   Shen (paper appeals: proving dishonesty) [2014] UKUT 236  (IAC);  and  on
   Shehzad v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016] EWCA Civ  615
   which established that the respondent's generic  evidence  established  a
   case to answer on ETS/TOEIC and dishonesty.

81. There was then an evidential burden  on  the  applicant  to  proffer  an
   innocent explanation which satisfied the minimum level  of  plausibility,
   and if so, the respondent would bear the burden of showing that the prima
   facie  innocent  explanation  should  be  rejected,  on  the  balance  of
   probabilities. Even an unsatisfactory performance in  oral  evidence  (SM
   and Qadir at [86]) might  not  prevent  a  Tribunal  considering  such  a
   witness to be a witness of truth.

82. In this application, the applicant had not been  given  the  opportunity
   of  providing  an  innocent  explanation.   At  [82]  in  the  Mohibullah
   decision, the Upper Tribunal had criticised an appellant who was aware of
   the gist of the respondent's allegations for 4 months before she took her
   negative decision, but did nothing. The present applicant  had  not  been
   given even the gist of the allegation at any time before the respondent's
   adverse decision was made.  The challenge here was a  process  challenge,
   not a substantive challenge:  the  applicant  would  rely  on  R  on  the
   application of Thapa v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2014]
   EWHC 659 (Admin) at [4] and [5] in which Helen Mountfield  QC  considered
   whether judicial review was appropriate even  where  an  out  of  country
   right of appeal existed.  It does not appear to me that the  decision  in
   Thapa is of much assistance in the present case.

83. Mr Sharma recites the change in the judicial headnote for SM and  Qadir.
    The only  relevant  headnote  is  that  which  currently  appears.    He
   submitted that the respondent's decision making process  was  flawed  and
   reserved the right to make submissions about the  respondent's  evidence.
   Mr Sharma sought permission to relyon the assessment  by  Upper  Tribunal
   Judge Lindsley of Professor French's report in  Kadivar  v  Secretary  of
   State for the Home Department [IA/42545/2104].  The applicant  would  ask
   the Upper Tribunal to quash the decision under challenge, with  costs  in
   favour of the applicant and any other appropriate order.

84. In oral submissions, Mr Sharma accepted that the respondent  had  raised
   a case to answer and that the generic evidence in this  application  went
   further than that which was considered in SM and Qadir or in Shehzad. The
   applicant's witness statement  had  been  delivered  late  and  contained
   responses to the respondent's submissions.

85. Mr Sharma argued that the applicant had raised an  innocent  explanation
   which satisfied the minimum level of plausibility: he  had  completed  an
   LLB degree and the Legal Practice Course, and had practised  as  an  OISC
   representative for 2 years, all of which argued that he  had  significant
   English language capability.  The applicant had taken a number  of  other
   examinations set and marked in English.

86. There was no reason for the applicant to remember  the  questions  asked
   in this particular test. The applicant's evidence, although the  Tribunal
   might consider it poor, was no worse than that of the  applicants  in  SM
   and Qadir, or Abbas, and should be treated as  credible.   The  applicant
   was one person, dealing with the case alone.  The respondent had a  deep-
   rooted, heartfelt interest in the outcome of these applications  overall,
   and  the  advantage  of  being  in  contact  with  Jones  Day,  who  were
   representing ETS in litigation between the respondent and that company.

87. Mr Sharma relied on the judgment of Lord Justice Richards in  R  on  the
   application of Giri v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2015]
   EWCA Civ 784 at [20], which distinguished the power of the  Secretary  of
   State under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1971 from that under section
   10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999:

           "20.  The position would be different if we were  concerned  not
           with the exercise of the power under section 3 of the  1971  Act
           to grant leave to remain but with a decision to remove a  person
           under section 10 of the 1999 Act on the ground that  he  or  she
           had used deception in seeking leave to remain (see paragraph  13
           above). In that event, as a matter  of  statutory  construction,
           the very existence of  the  power  to  remove  would  depend  on
           deception having been used; and in judicial  review  proceedings
           challenging  the  decision  to  remove,  the  question   whether
           deception  had  been  used  would  be  a  precedent   fact   for
           determination by the court in accordance with Khawaja. ...

           In practice, however, the issue will rarely arise in that  form,
           because decisions under section  10  are  immigration  decisions
           carrying a right of appeal to the tribunal, which can review for
           itself the facts on which the decision under appeal  was  based,
           and the existence of that alternative remedy means that judicial
           review is not available in the absence of special or exceptional
           factors: see, most recently, the decision of  this  court  in  R
           (Mehmood and Ali) v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department
           [2015] EWCA Civ 744."

   There was here a question of precedent fact,  which  the  Upper  Tribunal
   must determine, that is to say, whether the applicant had used deception.



88. Mr Sharma observed that in the present case, the applicant did not  have
   any alternative remedy.  The applicant had lost his indefinite  leave  to
   remain and if that decision were upheld, he  would  no  longer  be  in  a
   position where he could show 10 years' continuous  lawful  leave  in  the
   United  Kingdom.   The  applicant  would  not  be  able  to  reapply  for
   indefinite leave to remain.   He would be repatriated, and refused  entry
   to the roll of solicitors in England and Wales.  Mr Sharma submitted that
   those  consequences  were  much  greater  that  what  faced  the  average
   unsuccessful immigrant.

89. Mr Sharma considered it  unfair  to  criticise  the  applicant  for  not
   seeking copies of the recordings of his voice for the test he claimed  to
   have taken: he submitted that this formed part of the respondent's second
   evidential burden, to make her case, rather than the applicant's duty  to
   provide a plausible explanation. The respondent had not produced any copy
   of the ETS test certificate, nor any independent documents  from  ETS  or
   voice recording of the applicant's tests, to support her allegation  that
   the applicant had not taken the examination himself.

90. Mr Sharma argued that the applicant was a confident individual  who  had
   studied previously, and passed, difficult courses in  English,  including
   an advocacy course.  He had no need to take a fraudulent TOEIC  test,  as
   his LLB degree exempted  him  from  taking  one.  In  January  2012,  the
   respondent did not require such a test for a Tier  4  visa:  it  was  the
   College where the applicant wanted  to  study  which  had  required  this
   qualification. Once the ETS/TOEIC test result had been used to  obtain  a
   CAS, the applicant was obliged to send it  to  the  respondent  with  his
   application, although it was  not  otherwise  required  to  evidence  his
   English language ability.

91. I reminded Mr Sharma of the grammatical infelicities in the  applicant's
   witness statement, and the occasions during the applicant's evidence when
   questions had been repeated and reframed,  or  where  the  applicant  had
   answered a different question, or spoken too softly for his answer to  be
   heard.  Mr Sharma responded that poor English in the applicant's  witness
   statement was nothing to the point, and everyone made grammatical errors,
   including some which he identified in the respondent's  detailed  grounds
   of defence.

92. Mr Sharma accepted that the applicant's actual English language  ability
   was not necessarily  determinative  of  the  question  of  deception:   a
   candidate's motive for deceiving was not limited in that way and  it  was
   not for the Court or Tribunal to  seek  to  identify  the  reason  why  a
   candidate had chosen to use a proxy test taker (see  MA  at  [57]).   The
   real question was whether there was enough evidence to suggest that  this
   particular individual did use a proxy:  if so, he would  never  become  a
   solicitor.

93. Despite there being no challenge to the findings of fact in the  grounds
   for review, and not having objected to any of the post-decision evidence,
   Mr Sharma sought to go behind the factual matrix.  He argued that:

     i)    the ETS look-up tool which was relied upon was the  respondent's
        summary of the ETS evidence, not the evidence of  ETS  itself,  and
        the underlying evidence on  which  the  respondent's  decision  was
        based had not been produced;
    ii)    it could  not  be  correct  that  over  an  11-month  period  at
        Elizabeth College, 100% of the qualifications obtained were  either
        invalid or questionable. If that were true, Mr Sharma accepted that
        it would be outrageous, but that finding was so stark that, on  the
        balance of probabilities, it should be rejected;
   iii)  in  any  event,  on  the  day  on  which  the  applicant  sat  his
        examination,  many  of  the  qualifications   were   rated   merely
        'questionable' rather than 'invalid' (though  the  applicant's  was
        rated 'invalid'); and
    iv) that the evidence about there being 10 people taking the test, when
        the test results showed 65 people had done so, could  be  explained
        in a number of ways, for example by the candidates being split into
        smaller groups, 10 to a room.

   The difficulty as far as the last point is concerned is that such was not
   the applicant's evidence.

94. Mr Sharma relied on Kadivar [IA/42545/2014], an unreported  decision  of
   Upper Tribunal Judge Lindsley promulgated on 8 July 2016.   No  objection
   was taken on behalf of the respondent, and in the interests of justice, I
   take  that  decision  into  account.   Kadivar  was  a  case  where   the
   respondent's Presenting  Officer  accepted  that  the  applicant  gave  a
   credible account and was a reliable witness.   That applicant was able to
   give some details about the speaking test. At [20]-[21] in Kadivar, Judge
   Lindsley considered Professor French's  report,  which  said  that  there
   would be a certain  number of false positives; that ETS held no  data  on
   the quality of the sound on the recordings; and so on.  Given the lack of
   evidence  that  Mr  Kadivar  had  in  fact  cheated,  and   his   general
   credibility, Judge Lindsley did not  accept  that  the  generic  evidence
   produced was sufficient to enable her to find, on the facts  and  to  the
   civil standard of balance  of  probabilities,  that  the  respondent  was
   entitled to conclude that he had used deception.  If the  Upper  Tribunal
   in the present case found the applicant to be  a  credible  and  reliable
   witness, Mr Sharma submitted that the same approach should be adopted  in
   this application.

95. Mr Sharma relied on the evidence of  Professor  Sommer  in  relation  to
   Synergy College, which indicated that ETS' process in dealing with  proxy
   test taking was imperfect and that even  genuine  candidates  could  fall
   foul of procedures used to determine who had used a 'pilot' or proxy test
   taker.

96. Mr Sharma expanded on his skeleton argument as to  procedural  fairness.
   The applicant was not told, before the  revocation  decision  was  taken,
   that he was considered to be a person who had used deception by  using  a
   'pilot'  at  Elizabeth  College.   The  applicant  had  been   given   no
   opportunity to suggest an interview or provide other  evidence.   Had  he
   had that opportunity, the applicant could have made the arguments he made
   now.  In the Pre-Action Protocol  reply,  the  respondent  had  indicated
   that she was prepared to consider further submissions, which  was  surely
   an indication that she accepted that her decision making was inadequate.

97. In reply, Mr Thomann for the respondent submitted that this  was  not  a
   case where an applicant had provided  a  plausible  explanation  for  the
   difficulties in his evidence.  The applicant's Counsel  had  produced  an
   ingenious suggestion as to why the applicant said 10 people were there on
   the day, when the College's records showed 65 people, but the  difficulty
   was that such submission did not reflect the evidence which the applicant
   had given.

98.  As  regards  fairness,  Mohibullah  held  that  fairness  was  context-
   specific.  There  was  nothing  to  be  gained,  on  the  facts  of  this
   application, by a fairness dispute.

Discussion

99. I begin by considering the guidance  of  Mr  Justice  William  Davis  in
   Abbas as to the correct approach to be taken:

   "7.      It is agreed that the relevant principles to be applied  are  as
   follows:
      . ...
      . Whether deception was used by  the  Claimant  in  this  case  is  a
        precedent  fact  for  the  court  to  determine  because  the  very
        existence of the Secretary of State's power as  exercised  in  this
        case depended on deception having been used.
      . The legal burden of proving that the Claimant used  deception  lies
        on the Secretary of  State  albeit  that  there  is  a  three-stage
        process. The  Secretary  of  State  first  must  adduce  sufficient
        evidence to raise the issue of  fraud.  The  Claimant  has  then  a
        burden of raising  an  innocent  explanation  which  satisfies  the
        minimum level of plausibility. If that burden  is  discharged,  the
        Secretary of State must establish on  a  balance  of  probabilities
        that this innocent explanation is to be rejected.
      . There is one civil standard of proof (which is the standard  to  be
        applied). The seriousness of the consequences does  not  require  a
        different standard of proof but flexibility in its application will
        involve consideration of the strength and quality of the  evidence.
        The more serious the consequence, the stronger must be the evidence
        adduced for the necessary standard to be reached."

100. Mr Sharma does not dispute that the  first  stage  of  the  three-stage
   process is met.  The next question is whether the applicant has raised an
   innocent explanation which satisfies the minimum level  of  plausibility,
   to the civil standard of proof of balance of probabilities.

101.  The  applicant  says  that  the  respondent's   decision   is   unfair
   procedurally, and that he  should  have  been  given  an  opportunity  to
   explain and comment on the  evidence  before  his  indefinite  leave  was
   cancelled.  He has had that opportunity today: but a full opportunity  to
   give whatever evidence he considered might assist him, the applicant  has
   not produced a satisfactory explanation.  The respondent was entitled  to
   rely on the evidence before her that the applicant had taken  a  test  at
   the 'fraud factory' Elizabeth College and there is no unfairness  in  her
   taking account of that in the present application.

102. The  standard  of  English  required  by  the  College  from  whom  the
   applicant sought to obtain a CAS was CEFR B2, which requires him to  show
   the ability to understand  the  main  ideas  of  complex  text,  on  both
   concrete and abstract topics,  including  technical  discussions  in  his
   field of specialization;  to  interact  with  a  degree  of  fluency  and
   spontaneity that makes regular interaction  with  native  speakers  quite
   possible without strain for either party; and to produce clear,  detailed
   text on a wide range of subjects and explain a  viewpoint  on  a  topical
   issue giving the advantages and disadvantages of various options.

103.  It  is  right  that   this   applicant   had   successfully   obtained
   qualifications on a number of courses taught in English, and examined  on
   paper.  He had also practised as an  OISC  representative  for  2  years.
   However, in his witness statement, as in his oral evidence, the applicant
   made multiple grammatical errors.   His  oral  evidence  was  given  very
   quietly, with the applicant having to be reminded to speak  clearly,  and
   the applicant misunderstood questions on a number  of  occasions,  giving
   answers to a different question.  It could not be said  that  interacting
   with the applicant during his evidence  was  without  strain  for  either
   party.

104.  I  remind  myself  that  the  applicant's  actual   English   language
   competence, whether at the date of decision or now, is not  determinative
   of this application.  It is  not  for  the  Upper  Tribunal  to  seek  to
   establish for itself the level of competence which the applicant  has  in
   the English language, or what other reason he might have had for choosing
   to pay someone else to take his test for him, as the respondent  and  ETS
   say that he did. As stated in Abbas, there are many reasons why a  person
   might choose a dishonest, rather than an honest, way to obtain an English
   language qualification.  This applicant had much to gain from a guarantee
   of a successful  English  language  test,  given  how  close  he  was  to
   obtaining indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom.

105. The applicant's proffered explanation is  no  more  than  an  assertion
   that he did indeed sit the test himself and had confidence he could  pass
   it.  His explanation for choosing Elizabeth College, now a  known  'fraud
   factory', to which he  travelled  across  London  to  sit  the  test,  is
   unsatisfactory: there was a test  centre  locally,  with  available  test
   dates just a few weeks later and if the applicant was as confident of his
   English language competence as he now asserts, he could more conveniently
   have taken his test there.

106. The applicant has not explained why he has  not  put  in  evidence  the
   receipt for his cash payment, which he says he still  has  at  home,  and
   which could establish that he did indeed pay only the test fee,  and  not
   any additional money for a 'pilot' test taker to take  the  test  on  his
   behalf.  Further, the applicant has not taken the opportunity to call for
   the voice records of his test and prove (if he can)  that  the  voice  on
   those records is his.

107. The applicant has been aware since November 2015 of  the  gist  of  the
   case against him, and he has been legally advised.  I bear in  mind  that
   the applicant is not a layman: he has  two  law  degrees  and  the  Legal
   Practice qualification, and has practised as an OISC representative.  The
   applicant can be taken to know the value of evidence.    The  applicant's
   evidence comes to this: that he chose a college far away from home,  went
   there to pay in cash for his test in  advance  but  has  not  produced  a
   receipt for that payment, remembered incorrectly how many people attended
   the College on the day of his test, cannot remember any of the  questions
   he was asked on the day and that he 'has confidence he can  do  the  test
   himself'.

108. Overall, I  am  not  satisfied  that  the  applicant  has  provided  an
   explanation which meets even the modest test of  evidential  plausibility
   required to shift the burden of proof to  the  respondent  at  the  third
   stage.

109.  Even  if  there  were  such  a  burden  on  the  respondent  in   this
   application, I have no doubt that she would  be  able  to  discharge  it.
   Having regard to  the  evidence  before  her  in  relation  to  Elizabeth
   College, and the finding that the applicant was one of those  whose  test
   was rated 'invalid', the respondent was entitled  to  conclude  that  the
   applicant had used deception.   At the date of decision,  the  respondent
   had available to  her  the  2014  interim  Project  Fa�ade  report  which
   indicated that an ongoing criminal inquiry relating to Elizabeth  College
   had established that not one of the speaking and writing tests for  TOEIC
   at that College  was  regarded  as  reliable.   69%  of  the  tests  were
   identified as invalid, and the remaining 31% were considered by ETS to be
   questionable.

110. The evidence which has become available since the respondent  made  her
   decision, that of Mr Sewell and the Project Fa�ade report,  is  that  the
   results from Elizabeth College were so unreliable  that  no  test  result
   from that College, even if an applicant sat the test  himself,  could  be
   regarded as genuine.  I place weight on the evidence  of  TDI  Carter  of
   Project Fa�ade that none of the ETS voice samples matched the  voices  of
   candidates being interviewed under caution; that money had passed into  a
   director's account, far in excess of the  test  fee,  from  6  identified
   TOEIC candidates; that one test taker had admitted  using  a  'pilot'  (a
   proxy test taker) and that on 15 May 2012, ETS had conducted an audit and
   found someone who appeared to be a 'pilot' actually sitting a test.   The
   evidence of fraud at Elizabeth College, both in the materials before  the
   Secretary of State, and the later materials produced under cover  of  the
   statements of Ms Green and Mr Sewell, and in the  evidence  of  Professor
   French and Mr Heighway, is overwhelming.

111. It follows that, even if  the  applicant  had  satisfied  me  that  the
   decision taken on the evidence before  the  respondent  at  the  date  of
   decision was unsafe, if the decision  were  taken  again  today  and  the
   respondent had regard to the evidence now known to her, the outcome would
   be the same.  The applicant claims to have  taken  a  test  at  Elizabeth
   College where the evidence is that there were no genuine  tests  at  all.
   The respondent would be entitled to regard that as evidence of deception.
   Judicial review is a discretionary remedy and it would  be  inappropriate
   to quash the present decision if the outcome would certainly be the same,
   as I find to be the case here.

112. For all of the above reasons, this application fails and is dismissed.

Costs and appeal

113. As the applicant appeared in person,  I  have  explained  to  him  that
   under paragraph 44(4A) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
   2008 (as amended), he could ask the Upper Tribunal to  consider  granting
   permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal.

114. I explained that in any event, I am required  to  consider  for  myself
   whether I should grant permission to  appeal  to  the  Court  of  Appeal,
   pursuant to paragraph 44(4B) Upper Tribunal Rules.  I also  explained  to
   the applicant that he may, if he wishes, seek to  renew  his  application
   directly to the Court of Appeal but that the time for so doing is 28 days
   from the date when my decision on permission to appeal is given.

115. The applicant told me that he  did  not  wish  to  seek  permission  to
   appeal the Upper Tribunal's decision and would accept the outcome of  the
   application.

116. I have refused permission, because I am not  satisfied  that  there  is
   any arguable error of law in the judgment I have just handed down.

117. Costs will follow the event.  The applicant will pay  the  respondent's
   reasonable costs of these proceedings, to be assessed if not agreed.
