Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr McVite
For the Respondent:    Mr D K Marrington of Alam Ahmed Ltd


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant in this appeal is the Entry Clearance Officer to  whom  I
    shall refer as "the claimant".  The respondent is Zaheer  Muhammad  who
    was born on 30th December, 1974, and who is a citizen of Pakistan.   On
    29th July, 2012, the respondent  completed  an  application  for  entry
    clearance as a partner under Appendix FM of  Statement  of  Changes  in
    Immigration Rules, HC 395, as amended ("the Immigration Rules").

2.   The claimant considered the respondent's application but refused it  on
    1st November, 2012.  In doing so, the claimant said this:-

         "You state at question 1.28 that your sponsor  is  responsible  for
         the financial support of a child, Muhammad Anis born 05/07/12.  You
         state that 'being new born, child is  breast-fed'.   You  completed
         your application form on 29/07/2012.  The certificate provided with
         your application states the child was stillborn.   Your  statements
         on your application lead me to doubt that you either are  aware  of
         this fact or understand it, leading me to strongly doubt  that  you
         are in regular contact with your sponsor or that  your  sponsorship
         is subsisting and  genuine.   You  have  provided  no  evidence  of
         ongoing contact or communication with your sponsor,  notably  at  a
         difficult time in your sponsor's life, furthering doubts  regarding
         your relationship.  I am therefore not satisfied your  relationship
         with your sponsor is genuine and subsisting or that you  intend  to
         live together permanently in  the  UK.   I  therefore  refuse  your
         application under paragraph  EC-P.1.1(d)  of  Appendix  FM  of  the
         Immigration Rules.


         Your sponsor is not  exempt  from  the  financial  requirements  as
         defined at paragraph E-ECP.3.3.  I am not able to take into account
         any potential employment you have available to you in the UK or any
         offers of financial support from third parties.  In order  to  meet
         the financial requirements of the Rules your sponsor needs a  gross
         income of at least �18,600 per annum.


         You state your sponsor has a gross income  of  �18,980  per  annum.
         Where the person is in salaried employment in the UK at the date of
         application and has been employed by their current employer for  at
         least six months, their gross annual income will be  the  total  of
         the gross annual salary from their employment  as  it  was  at  its
         lowest level in the six months prior to the  date  of  application.
         Your sponsor's stated income is based on a single pay slip  showing
         a gross payment of �365 for one week.   Your  sponsor's  other  pay
         slips indicate a salary of �194.56 gross per week.  This equates to
         �10,117.12 per annum gross.


         In order to qualify, you and your  sponsor  require  �37,207.20  in
         savings in order to meet  the  financial  requirements.   You  have
         provided no evidence of savings at this level.  I therefore  refuse
         your application under paragraph EC-P1.1(b) of Appendix FM  of  the
         Immigration Rules.


         In addition, in respect of salaried employment in the UK all of the
         following evidence (original documents) must be provided:-

           . The P60 for the relevant period or periods (if issued).

           . Wage slips covering:

             (i)  a  period  of  six  months  prior  to  the  date  of  the
                  application if the applicant has been  employed  by  their
                  current employer for at least six months; or

             (ii) a period of twelve  months  prior  to  the  date  of  the
                  application if the applicant has been  employed  by  their
                  current employer for less than six months.

           . A letter from the employer confirming:

             (i)  the person's employment and gross annual salary;

             (ii) the length of their employment;

             (iii)    the period over which they have been or were paid the
                  level of salary relied upon in the application; and

             (iv) the type of employment (permanent, fixed term contract or
             agency).

           . A signed contract of employment.

           . Monthly personal bank statements  corresponding  to  the  same
             period as the wage slips, showing that  the  salary  has  been
             paid into an account in the name of the person or in the  name
             of the person and their partner jointly.

         These documents are specified in the Immigration Rules in  appendix
         FM-SE and must be provided.  You have  not  submitted  all  of  the
         required documentation to  demonstrate  your  sponsor's  income  as
         claimed.  You have not provided six  months'  pay  slips  and  your
         income is not seen in your statement.  No  contract  of  employment
         has been provided.   I  therefore  refuse  your  application  under
         paragraph EC-P.1.1(b) of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules."

3.   The respondent appealed that decision  and  his  appeal  was  heard  by
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Ince sitting at  Bradford  on  7th  November,
    2013.  In the judge's  determination,  promulgated  on  19th  December,
    2013, the judge found the sponsor to be a credible witness and  on  the
    basis of the  evidence  she  heard,  concluded  that  the  couple  have
    demonstrated  that  the  relationship  between  them  is  genuine   and
    subsisting.  In respect of maintenance, the judge noted that  were  the
    couple to make an application now they would apparently fall within the
    Rules because the sponsor has been in  full-time  employment  for  more
    than six months earning  a  weekly  wage  of  �365  gross.   The  judge
    appeared to proceed to consider the respondent's Article 8  rights  and
    noted that there appeared to be no dispute  that  family  life  existed
    between the couple having found the marriage to be  genuine  and  noted
    that the sponsor was a UK citizen and noted too that the appellant  now
    appears to meet the requirements of the Rules. The judge concluded that
    she should allow the appeal, "under the Immigration Rules Appendix FM."
     The judge went on at paragraph 38 to say this:-
              "Notwithstanding that the couple, as at the date of  decision,
             did not  strictly  satisfy  the  maintenance  requirements  of
             Appendix FM they do now and therefore,  in  relation  to  this
             issue, I allow the appeal under Article 8."

4.   The claimant challenged the judge's decision,  pointing  out  that  the
    evidence before the Tribunal did not show that the sponsor  could  meet
    the income threshold requirements for the period of six  months  before
    the date of the application.  They assert that  the  Tribunal  made  no
    finding on this point.  Neither did the judge explain how the  decision
    in MM (no citation is given  in  the  determination)  was  relevant  in
    concluding that the sponsor meets the requirements of  the  Immigration
    Rules. The judge does not apply the  comprehensive  Rules  relating  to
    specified evidence contained  within  Appendix  FM-SC.   The  challenge
    suggested that given that the  respondent  clearly  did  not  meet  the
    conditions of the Immigration  Rules,  the  Article  8  assessment  was
    similarly flawed.

5.   At the hearing before me Mr McVite relied on the grounds and  asked  me
    to  note  that  the  appeal  had  been   allowed   under   Article   8.
    Notwithstanding this, at paragraph 20 of the  determination  the  judge
    noted a concession made by the sponsor's representative.  At  paragraph
    20 the judge recorded the following:-

         "Ms Aktar conceded that the [respondent] could not  succeed  under
         Appendix FM in relation to the financial matters or in relation  to
         family life.  Accordingly, those parts of the  appeal  fell  to  be
         considered under the residual Article 8 provisions."

6.   Notwithstanding that the maintenance  provisions  were  not  satisfied,
    the judge then purported  to  allow  the  appeal  under  the  Rules  at
    paragraphs 37 and 38, where the judge said:-

         "37. I therefore conclude that this is nothing other than a genuine
             marriage, that the marriage is subsisting and that each of the
             couple has the intention to live permanently with  the  other.
             I  therefore  allow  the  appeal  on  this  issue  under   the
             Immigration Rules Appendix FM.


         38.  Notwithstanding that the couple, as at the date  of  decision,
             did not  strictly  satisfy  the  maintenance  requirements  of
             Appendix FM, they do now and therefore, in  relation  to  this
             issue, I allow the appeal under Article 8."

7.   The determination is a confused document. In considering  the  question
    of proportionality the judge has wrongly assumed that as at the date of
    the hearing the respondent does meet the requirement of the Rules, when
    very clearly he does not.

8.   For the respondent, Mr Marrington accepted that  the  judge  had  erred
    and should not have allowed the appeal under the Immigration Rules.  He
    suggested, however, that the judge was entitled  to  allow  the  appeal
    under Article 8, because at the date of the  hearing  the  sponsor  was
    earning sufficient and at paragraph 16 of the determination he noted an
    exceptional circumstance, namely the fact that the couple's  child  was
    stillborn.

9.   I reserved my determination.

10.  It was conceded at the hearing  before  the  judge  on  behalf  of  the
    respondent, that the appeal could not  succeed  under  Appendix  FM  in
    relation to financial matters nor in relation to family  life.   As  at
    the date of the hearing, the judge found that the sponsor  was  earning
    sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Rules, but what the judge
    did not do was to consider whether the documents specified in  Appendix
    FM-SE had been provided without making a find that they had been.   The
    judge was not, therefore, in a position to find that the respondent met
    the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules  as  at  the  date  of  the
    hearing.

11.  Given  that  the  parties  could  not  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules, the appeal could not succeed under Article 8.  I  do
    not accept that the tragic stillbirth  of  the  parties'  child  is  an
    exceptional  circumstance.   I  know  from  my  own   bitter   personal
    experience that it is a most tragic and upsetting  experience  for  any
    couple to lose a child, whether because of a miscarriage or because  of
    a stillbirth where the mother has carried the foetus for a  full  term.
    I do not seek in any way to under undermine this couple's very sad  and
    tragic loss but, regrettably, it is not an uncommon event.  In my  view
    it  is  not  an   event   which   renders   the   claimant's   decision
    disproportionate to the need to maintain effective immigration control.

12.  For the reasons I have given, I set aside the determination  of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Ince, having found it contains errors on a point of
    law and I remake the decision myself.  The respondent's appeal  against
    the decision of the Entry Clearance Officer to refuse  to  grant  entry
    clearance as a partner under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules dated
    1st November, 2012 is dismissed.
