                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Afghanistan born on 1 January  1995.   He
    came to the UK as a boy of 14 or so and  claimed  asylum.   The  asylum
    claim was made on or about arrival and it was ultimately refused by the
    Respondent on 9 April 2010.  The Respondent made no removal decision at
    that stage however. Instead, in line with then policy, she granted  him
    a period of discretionary leave to remain until 30 June  2012.   Within
    time, the Appellant applied for an extension of that leave, or rather a
    variation of it, on the basis of his  asylum  claim.  There  were  then
    further immigration decisions made by the Respondent in relation to the
    Appellant on 28 August 2013.  The decisions were twofold. A decision to
    refuse  to  vary  leave  to  remain,  and  a  decision  to  remove   to
    Afghanistan.  Both of those decisions were immigration decisions and as
    such the Appellant appealed against them both.

 2. His appeal hearing was heard by Judge Clapham on 23 September 2014.  In
    the course of the decision promulgated on 14 October 2014 the  Tribunal
    dismissed  the  asylum  claim  and  dismissed  the  appeal  under   the
    Immigration Rules.  There is no  challenge  by  the  Appellant  to  the
    judge's decision in relation to the  asylum  claim  or  the  Article  3
    claim.

 3. The judge did, however, allow the appeal on Article 8 grounds and it is
    that decision which was challenged by the Respondent in an  application
    for permission to appeal which was granted by Judge T R P  Hollingworth
    on 5 December 2014. So the matter comes before me today.

 4. It is accepted now (although it was not accepted  before  the  Tribunal
    below) that the Appellant could not and  cannot  succeed  under  either
    paragraph 276ADE or Appendix FM.  The Appellant's Article  8  claim  is
    limited to his private life.  It was based on friendships that  he  had
    made since his arrival in the UK and the studies that he had undertaken
    and in particular the relationship that he  had  formed  with  a  young
    woman who was described as his girlfriend.  It was not  suggested  that
    the young couple cohabited, or that they were formally engaged.

 5. The decision of the judge made no formal reference to Section  117A  or
    Section 117B of the 2002 Act, although his decision post dated 28  July
    2014. It is possible, however, in paragraph 50 to see  that  there  was
    reference to the  public  interest  in  the  maintenance  of  effective
    immigration controls and although there  is  no  express  reference  to
    Section 117B(1) in my judgment that is a  complaint  of  no  substance,
    because it is plain that the judge had in mind the  operative  part  of
    that Section.

 6. Where the judge does appear to have gone badly wrong in my judgment  is
    his failure to consider sub-Sections (4) and (5)  and  the  distinction
    that must exist between them.  In my judgment the Appellant's status as
    one with a grant of discretionary leave to remain  was  a  "precarious"
    immigration status. Therefore sub-section (5) was operative and  little
    weight should have been given to the private life  he  had  established
    during that time.  The judge appears to have equated "precarious"  with
    "unlawful" from the comments that  he  made  in  paragraph  51  of  the
    decision and in doing so I am satisfied he made an error of law.

 7. I am also satisfied that that error  of  law  is  material  because  it
    infects the whole of the context in  which  the  judge  considered  the
    proportionality of the removal  decision,  considering  as  he  was  an
    Article 8 appeal outside the Immigration Rules under Razgar principles.
     What he had before him was the not uncommon situation  where  a  young
    man with the benefit of a period of leave  had  gained  qualifications,
    had gained a fluency in English of some degree, (the judge described it
    as reasonable proficiency in English) and  had  formed  a  relationship
    with a girl.  That relationship was not, however, of the quality of  an
    engagement to be married, still less was it a marriage.  The judge made
    no findings even as to its length, although that  was  no  doubt  dealt
    with in the witness statements before him.

 8. The position is in my judgment, applying the guidance to be found in MM
    (Lebanon) [2014] EWCA Civ 985 that his Article  8  appeal  fell  to  be
    considered in the context of his inability to satisfy  the  Immigration
    Rules at the date of the hearing (or today) for a  grant  of  leave  to
    remain as a fiancï¿½e, or as an unmarried partner. He was plainly able to
    make an  application  for  entry  clearance  from  Afghanistan,  if  so
    advised, with the support of his girlfriend.  That  was  a  matter  for
    another day if indeed he ever made that application  from  outside  the
    country.  It was not suggested before the judge, and therefore  it  was
    not open for him to find, and he did not find, that no such application
    for entry clearance could ever succeed. Accordingly, taking  everything
    in the round, in my judgment the decision on the Article 8  appeal  has
    to be set aside and remade so as to dismiss the human rights appeal.

Notice of decision


      The Determination did contain an error of law in the decision to allow
      the Article 8 appeal, which requires that decision to be set aside and
      remade. I remake that decision so as to dismiss the Article 8 appeal.


Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
