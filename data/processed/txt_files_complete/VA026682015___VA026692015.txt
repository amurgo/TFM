                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Although this is an appeal by the Secretary of State on behalf  of  the
    Entry Clearance Officer, I shall refer to the parties as in the  First-
    tier Tribunal. The Appellants are husband and wife and are citizens  of
    Pakistan. Their appeals against  the  refusal  of  entry  clearance  as
    visitors was allowed by First-tier Tribunal Judge Lagunju in a decision
    promulgated on 19th February 2016.


 2. The First-tier Tribunal Judge found, on the basis of  the  evidence  at
    the time of the decision, that the Appellants were genuine visitors who
    intended to return to Pakistan at the end of their  stay.  Contrary  to
    the  decision  of  the  Respondent,  the   Appellants   satisfied   the
    Immigration Rules.


 3. However, the Appellants' appeals were  limited  to  Article  8  grounds
    under Section 84(1)(c) of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act
    2002.  The  judge  quite  rightly  made  findings  in  respect  of  the
    Immigration Rules since this was relevant to  proportionality.   Having
    concluded that the Rules were satisfied, the judge went  on  to  assess
    the Article 8 claim and made the following findings.

         "I am  satisfied  on  the  strength  of  the  documentary  evidence
         provided, coupled with the explanation provided in  the  ground  of
         appeal that the Appellants have shown that they  have  very  strong
         and significant ties  to  Pakistan  including  property,  finances,
         young children and employment.  According to  the  Sponsor  in  his
         letter the Appellants  are  relatively  wealthy  and  have  a  good
         quality of life in Pakistan. I am  satisfied  that  the  Appellants
         have shown that they are genuine visitors who will  return  at  the
         end of their visit. I  am  also  satisfied  that  the  Respondent's
         decision to refuse entry clearance amounts  to  a  disproportionate
         interference in the enjoyment of their private lives, which in this
         instance includes a short visit to see ailing family members."


 4. The Respondent applied for permission to appeal on the ground that  the
    judge erred in law in failing to consider whether Article 8 was engaged
    and had he done so he  would  have  concluded  that  it  was  not.  The
    Appellants  had  failed  to  establish  family   life   because   their
    relationship with their  grandparents  was  not  one  where  there  was
    dependency more than normal emotional ties.  The Respondent argues that
    the judge failed to have regard to Adeji  (visit  visas  -  Article  8)
    [2015] UKUT 0261 (IAC) which states at paragraph 13:

         "A person  who  satisfied  the  Tribunal  that  he  does  meet  the
         requirements of para 41 of HC 395 does not succeed on that account.
          He still has to demonstrate that refusal  represents  an  unlawful
         infringement of rights protected by Article 8 of the ECHR."

5.   The Respondent submits  that  the  judge  failed  to  make  a  reasoned
    finding that the decision interfered with the current status quo of the
    Appellants' relationship with their grandparents and  furthermore,  the
    proportionality assessment was  inadequate.   The  Appellants  had  not
    demonstrated that the interference with their right  to  family  and/or
    private life resulting from the refusal, had given rise to  such  grave
    consequences such as to engage Article 8.




6.   Permission to appeal was granted  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  E  B
    Grant on the ground that the judge had arguably misdirected himself  in
    law because Article 8 was not engaged on the facts of the appeal. There
    was no family life between the adult Appellants and their  grandparents
    and the private life limb of Article 8 cannot found a  right  of  entry
    following SS (Malaysia) [2004] UKAIT 00091.

7.   First-tier Tribunal Judge Grant stated: "The grounds and  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal seem to overlook a decision of the  Tribunal
    in Abbasi & Another (visit -  bereavement - Article 8) [2015] UKUT  463
    where the Tribunal found that the refusal of a visa to foreign national
    seeking to enter the United Kingdom for a finite  purpose  of  mourning
    with family members the recent death of a close relative  and  visiting
    the grave of the deceased is capable of constituting a disproportionate
    interference with the rights of the persons concerned  under  [Article]
    8.  It is difficult to see a distinction between visits for bereavement
    reasons and finite visits to  the  seriously  ill  who  might  soon  be
    deceased though there may well be a valid distinction between  the  two
    scenarios.  Given that in Abbasi the Tribunal found  that  [Article]  8
    can be engaged on private life grounds, it was incumbent on the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge to make a finding whether the entry  visa  for  the
    limited purpose of a hospital visit was protected by [Article] 8.
    The First-tier Tribunal did arguably err in law in failing to make  any
    specific finding on the private life of the appellants and how  it  was
    engaged by the refusal in the appeal and failed to go on and conduct  a
    structured proportionality balancing exercise taking into  account  the
    public interest considerations and the facts as  found  by  the  judge.
    Permission to appeal is granted on all grounds, including  the  impact,
    if any, Abbasi may have on the outcome of the appeals."

8.   Mr Duffy submitted  that  whether  someone  satisfied  the  Immigration
    Rules was relevant to proportionality and he accepted that there was no
    challenge to the judge's finding that the Appellants could satisfy  the
    Immigration Rules.  The Appellants had made an application to visit ill
    family members in hospital.  They had not shown that  they  had  family
    life.  Paragraph 24 of Mostafa was particularly  relevant  because  the
    family members here were not close family members as envisaged  by  the
    Tribunal in Mostafa, therefore  in  that  respect  the  Appellants  had
    failed to show that there was family life and therefore Article  8  was
    engaged.

9    Following Abbasi it was possible to assess  whether  there  were  grave
    consequences as a result of the refusal of  entry  clearance.  Even  if
    there was family life, the issue would be whether the consequences were
    of such gravity to engage Article 8.  He submitted that the Tribunal in
    Mostafa said that it was unlikely to be the case  unless  there  was  a
    really  close  relationship.  It  would  appear  that  the  Appellants'
    grandmother had died pending the hearing of this appeal  and  therefore
    it was clear she was gravely ill. Any future application could probably
    succeed following Abbasi given that  there  was  no  challenge  to  the
    findings that the Appellants were genuine visitors.

10.  Mr Duffy submitted that I must consider the circumstances  existing  at
    the time of the decision in  deciding  whether  the  refusal  of  entry
    clearance engaged Article  8  and,  if  so,  whether  it  was  in  fact
    proportionate in the circumstances.


Discussion and conclusion

11.  The judge quite properly assessed whether the Appellants  were  genuine
    visitors and there is no dispute in relation to his findings of fact in
    that regard. The Appellants satisfied the Immigration Rules. The  issue
    is whether the judge in effect allowed the appeal on that basis  rather
    than carrying out a proper consideration of Article 8.

12.  The judge concluded  that  the  Appellants  satisfied  the  Immigration
    Rules and that there  was  a  disproportionate  interference  with  the
    enjoyment of their private life. He found that  private  life  in  this
    instance included a short visit to see ailing  family  members.  Whilst
    this conclusion is brief, it is a conclusion which was open to  him  on
    the evidence. I find  that  any  error  in  failing  to  demonstrate  a
    structured approach to Article 8 is  not  material  for  the  following
    reasons.

13.  The judge quite clearly finds that a short visit to see  ailing  family
    members can amount to family and/or private life for  the  purposes  of
    Article 8.  The  judge  only  uses  the  word  private  life,  but  the
    Appellants clearly have a family relationship with their grandparents.

14.  In Mostafa, the Tribunal  concluded  that  it  will  only  be  in  very
    unusual circumstances that a person other than a close relative will be
    able to show that the refusal of entry clearance comes within the scope
    of Article 8(1). In practical terms it was  likely  to  be  limited  to
    cases where the relationship is that of husband, wife  or  other  close
    life partner or a parent and a minor child.

15.   However,  in  looking  at  the  family  and  private  life  of   these
    Appellants, the judge has quite clearly recognised that they do have  a
    relationship with their grandparents and that for the purposes  of  the
    visit the relationship is limited to seeing their grandparents, who are
    gravely ill and hospitalised, and probably likely  to  die.  The  judge
    therefore considers the visit on  the  basis  that  this  is  the  only
    opportunity the Appellants will have to see their  grandparents  before
    they die.

16.  The  refusal  of  entry  clearance  in  a  case  like  this  does  have
    consequences of such gravity because the Appellants will  be  prevented
    from having one last visit and prevented from saying goodbye  to  their
    grandparents if entry clearance is denied.  The circumstances  of  this
    case are exceptional in that respect.  No more exceptional  than  those
    recognised in Abbasi where a short visit  to  attend  the  funeral  and
    visit the grave of a deceased relative was considered to be  sufficient
    to engage Article 8.


17.  Accordingly, I am of the view that there was no error  of  law  in  the
    judge's conclusion that their private life in this instance was a short
    visit to see ailing family  members  and  therefore  Article  8(1)  was
    engaged. There was no public interest element to the balancing exercise
    of proportionality because the  Appellants  satisfied  the  Immigration
    Rules. Given the medical evidence  that  the  Appellants'  grandparents
    were suffering from serious illnesses, the judge's conclusion, that the
    refusal of entry clearance was disproportionate on the particular facts
    of this case, was one which was open to him on the  evidence.   I  find
    that there was no error of law in the judge's  decision  to  allow  the
    appeal on human rights grounds.

18.  Alternatively, if the judge has made an error of law in failing to  set
    out the five stage approach of  Razgar  and  specifically  dealing  and
    spelling out what those grave consequences were, although it is obvious
    on reading the decision what they were, then the error is not  material
    because the appeal was properly allowed on Article 8 grounds.

19.  I can see no difference between the case of Abbasi  and  this  one.  It
    seems  disproportionate  to  enable  Appellants   to   visit   deceased
    relatives, but not those who are seriously ill and about to die. It  is
    clear from the evidence that has been submitted post decision that  was
    in fact the case because the Appellants' grandmother died on  6th  June
    2016. It is of no comfort that  any  subsequent  application  to  visit
    would probably be allowed following the case of Abbasi.

20.  However, for the purposes of determining this  appeal,  I  cannot  take
    into account the  death  of  the  Appellants'  grandmother.  The  judge
    recognised the seriousness of the situation and took into account  that
    the grandparents were suffering from  illnesses  which  required  their
    hospitalisation and this was likely  to  be  the  last  time  that  the
    Appellants would be able to see them.  It is on  that  basis  that  the
    judge found that Article 8 was engaged and that the  refusal  of  entry
    clearance was disproportionate because the Appellants could satisfy the
    Immigration Rules.

21.  In summary, I conclude that there was no error of law  in  the  judge's
    decision to allow the  appeal  on  Article  8  grounds.  Any  error  in
    reasoning or structure was not material to the decision  to  allow  the
    appeal.  Accordingly, I dismiss the Respondent's appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal and the decision of First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Lagunju  shall
    stand.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

The file indicates that a fee is payable but no fee was in  fact  paid.   It
is unclear whether the Appellants have in fact paid the �80  requested.   If
they have paid that fee  I  make  a  fee  award  of  that  amount.   If,  as
indicated on the file  that  the  payment  was  not  taken  because  it  was
declined, then of course the Appellants are not  entitled  to  recover  that
amount.
