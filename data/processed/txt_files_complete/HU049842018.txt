of the
     Specialist Appeals Team

                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Appellant's  appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Woolley promulgated on 16th November 2018  in  which  he
    dismissed the Appellant's human rights appeal.

 2. The Appellant applied for entry clearance as the partner of the Sponsor
    under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.  He is a citizen  of  India
    who is married to a British national.  He had  previously  been  issued
    with a visa to come to the UK as a Tier 4 (General) Student  from  17th
    November 2009 to 18th April 2013. He had thereafter been refused  leave
    to remain on 1st March 2013.

 3. At the appeal before the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  the  Sponsor  was
    required to show a gross income of at least �18,600 per annum.  Her own
    personal earnings were �9,125 per annum.   However,  she  was  also  in
    receipt of money from Coventry  Social  Services  for  her  role  as  a
    special guardian to two children and received �12,000 from that special
    guardian role.  Those two children are now aged 14 and 12. The  Sponsor
    has a special guardianship order from  the  Family  Court  at  Coventry
    dating back to 2011 in respect  of  them.   As  part  of  that  special
    guardianship, she has parental responsibility  for  the  two  children.
    But the special  guardianship  order  did  not  in  itself  remove  the
    parental responsibility of the parents but obviously meant that she had
    primary responsibility. There is also in this case regular  contact  as
    documented within the bundle between the children's natural mother  and
    then on a supervised basis every six weeks

 4. The First-tier Tribunal Judge when dealing with the appeal looked first
    at the financial requirements under paragraphs E-ECP 3.1 and E-ECP  3.2
    of the Immigration Rules and found that  the  money  from  the  special
    guardianship allowance could not be  taken  into  account  under  those
    provisions of the Immigration Rules when determining the level  of  the
    Sponsor's income.

 5. However, the Judge  noted  that  Mrs  Hodgson's,  who  represented  the
    Appellant at the First-tier Tribunal, primary submission was in respect
    of the provisions of GEN 3.1 and Article 8.  The judge noted  that  GEN
    3.1 of Appendix FM had been introduced to govern the position where the
    relevant financial conditions were not met and that required  there  to
    be exceptional circumstances, which could render refusal of  breach  of
    Article 8, because such a refusal could result in  unjustifiably  harsh
    consequences for the applicant, their partner or the relevant child and
    that in those circumstances the decisionmaker can  take  into  account,
    the source of income,  the  financial  support  or  funds  set  out  in
    paragraphs 21A(2) of Appendix FM-SE. It was  argued  by  the  Appellant
    that that encompassed the special guardianship allowance.

 6. However, after having set out the requirements of GEN 3.1,  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge at paragraph 29 stated that:

         "It is noteworthy that this gloss  is  not  present  in  Article  8
         itself.   Similarly,  there   is   no   mention   of   'exceptional
         circumstances' or even 'unjustifiably harsh  consequences'  in  the
         Article, although Lord Bingham in Razgar recognised that successful
         applications under Article 8 might be the  exception  (and  Agyarko
         (Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department  [2017]  UKSC  11
         recognised that something  very  compelling  must  be  required  to
         outweigh the public interest)".

 7. The Judge then went on to discuss the case of Hesham  Ali  and  MM  and
    Others v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2014] EWCA Civ 985
    and concluded that she had to carry out a full Razgar assessment of the
    Appellant's rights under Article 8, as  a  separate  exercise  to  that
    envisaged in GEN 3.1, which he then proceeded  to  do  before  then  at
    paragraph 44 considering GEN 3.1 of Appendix FM.  The  Judge  concluded
    ultimately that there was no breach of  the  Appellant's  human  rights
    under Article 8 having conducted that exercise.

 8. The Appellant now seeks to appeal against that decision for the reasons
    set out within the Grounds of Appeal.  That document  is  a  matter  of
    record and is therefore not repeated  in  its  entirety,  here  but  in
    summary it is argued that the Judge wrongly made a decision  under  the
    Rules without properly considering  GEN  3.1  of  Appendix  FM  of  the
    Immigration Rules and misapplied that provision. It was  also  arguable
    the judge then failed to consider GEN 3.2 and made a decision which  is
    said to be unreasonable.

 9. Permission to appeal in this  case  had  being  granted  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Keane on 8th February 2019 who said that "in  particular
    that  in  omitting  Sections  GEN  3.1,  GEN  3.2  the  Judge   omitted
    considerations of matters which dependent  upon  the  Judge's  findings
    might arguably have borne materially on the outcome of  his  assessment
    in the proportionality decision under appeal".

10.  At  the  appeal  hearing  before  me  today  the  Appellant  has  been
    represented by Mr Reynolds of Counsel and the Secretary  of  State  was
    represented by Mr Tarlow, the Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.

11. The Secretary of State in this case had submitted a Rule 24 reply dated
    12th March 2019 in which it was argued that the Respondent opposed  the
    Appellant's  appeal  and  that   the   Judge   had   directed   himself
    appropriately.  It was argued that the Judge had considered there  were
    any exceptional compelling circumstances that would need  the  Tribunal
    to consider whether the Appellant could  benefit  from  Appendix  FM-SE
    paragraph 21A and the Judge had given valid reasons for  finding  there
    were not.  It was submitted that it is immaterial  that  the  FTTJ  had
    done so within the context of the Rules or under Article 8, as there is
    nothing the Appellant can point to that the FTTJ has failed to consider
    under the Rules that he has not considered in his Article 8 assessment.

12. Notwithstanding that Rule 24  reply  Mr  Tarlow  quite  properly  today
    noting his duties to the Tribunal has conceded that in  this  case  the
    fact that the Sponsor has a special guardianship order in her favour in
    respect of the  two  minor  children  for  whom  she  has  care  is  an
    exceptional circumstance, which ought to have been properly  considered
    and taken into account by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge,  which  he
    concedes was not fully taken account of and given sufficient weight  by
    the Judge in his decision. He concedes  that  this  does  amount  to  a
    material error of law.

13.  As conceded by Mr Tarlow, the Sponsor in this case could not simply go
    and live in India with the Appellant, as to do so would  have  required
    specific permission by the Family Court. The Special Guardianship order
    would have allowed the Sponsor to take the  children  abroad  only  for
    periods of up to four weeks at a time and there is an order for regular
    supervised contact  between  the  two  children  and  their  biological
    mother.  Mr Tarlow concedes that there was an issue there  that  should
    have been properly considered, which was not and that thereby the judge
    failed to properly consider GEN 3.1 and  the  decision  does  therefore
    contain a material error.

14. It is also apparent having looked at the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge that although the Judge set out the  provisions  of  GEN
    3.1 at paragraph 28 and went on at paragraph 29 of the decision to find
    that the 'gloss' as he described it in GEN 3.1 of Appendix FM  requires
    that "there  must  be  exceptional  circumstances  which  could  render
    refusal a breach of Article 8 because such a refusal  could  result  in
    unjustifiably harsh consequences  to  the  Applicant,  the  Sponsor  or
    relevant child by any breach", there  was  no  mention  of  exceptional
    circumstances or justifiably harsh consequences in  Article  8  itself,
    although the judge said that Lord Bingham  in  Razgar  recognised  that
    successful applications under Article 8 might be the exception and that
    the Supreme Court in case of Agyarko v Secretary of State for the  Home
    Department [2017] UKSC recognised something  very  compelling  must  be
    required to outweigh the public interest.

15. The Judge therefore considered that he had to  conduct  a  full  Razgar
    assessment of the Appellant's rights under  Article  8  as  a  separate
    exercise to that envisaged in GEN 3.1.  He proceeded to  do  so  before
    then considering at paragraph 43 that as there had not been a breach of
    Article 8 and  the  refusal  did  not  result  in  unjustifiably  harsh
    consequence for the Appellant, Sponsor or child,  he  was  not  allowed
    under GEN 3.1  to  take  account  of  other  sources  of  income  under
    paragraph 21A(1).

16. However, the wording of GEN.3.1(1) is

         "a) the financial requirement in paragraph E-ECP  3.1,  E-LTRP  3.1
         (in the context of an application for limited leave to remain as  a
         partner), E-ECC 2.1 or E-LTRC 2.1 applies and is not met  from  the
         specified sources referred to in the relevant paragraph; and

         b) It is evident from the information  provided  by  the  Applicant
         that there are exceptional circumstances which could render refusal
         of entry clearance or leave to remain a breach of Article 8 of  the
         European Convention on Human Rights,  because  such  refusal  could
         result being unjustifiably harsh consequences  for  the  Applicant,
         their partner or relevant child; then

           the  decision  maker  must  consider  whether  such   an   actual
         requirement is met to be taken account of the  sources  of  income,
         financial support or funds set out in paragraph 21A(2) of  Appendix
         FM-SE."

17. In that regard what GEN 3.1(1)(b) is looking at is whether or not there
    are exceptional circumstances which could render refusal  a  breach  of
    Article 8 because such refusal  could  result  in  unjustifiably  harsh
    consequences.  The difference in wording between GEN 3.1 and GEN 3.2 is
    that whereas in GEN 3.1 that the operative word is "could", in GEN  3.2
    which is a general catchall provision thereafter the operative word  is
    "would", such that  GEN  3.2(2)  reads  that  where  sub-paragraph  (1)
    applies the decision maker must consider

          "On the basis of the information provided by the Applicant whether
         there are exceptional circumstances which would render  refusal  of
         entry clearance or leave to enter or remain in breach of Article  8
         of the European Convention on Human Rights,  because  such  refusal
         would result in unjustifiably harsh consequences for the Appellant,
         their partner, a relevant child  or  another  family  member  whose
         Article 8 rights it is  evident  from  that  information  would  be
         affected by the decision to refuse the application".

18. It is GEN 3.2 which is the general  catchall  provision.   GEN  3.1  is
    based upon whether there 'could' be a breach of Article  8  because  of
    exceptional circumstances such that then  other  sources  of  financial
    income can be taken into account other those which are permitted to  be
    considered for the purposes of E-ECP 3.1 and 3.2.

19. GEN 3.1 did  not  require  the  judge  to  conduct  a  full  Article  8
    assessment in that regard and reach findings on whether  or  not  there
    would  actually  be  a  breach  of  Article  8  in  that  regard.    In
    consideration of whether or not  there  are  exceptional  circumstances
    which could render refusal of entry clearance  or  leave  to  remain  a
    breach of Article 8 because of unjustifiably harsh consequences, as  Mr
    Tarlow quite properly concedes, the judge has not properly  dealt  with
    that  issue  by  not  applying  the  correct  test  and  not   properly
    considering the effect of  the  special  guardianship.   As  Mr  Tarlow
    properly concedes that is a material error of law.

20. It is further apparent that when considering  proportionality,  one  of
    the factors the Judge took account of was whether  the  fact  that  the
    appellant met the requirements of the Immigration Rules at the time  of
    the application.  In that regard the judge has  also  effectively  'put
    the cart before the horse' because in determining that the requirements
    of the Immigration Rules were not met the judge has not  taken  account
    of the test under GEN 3.1 at that stage. It was only after  considering
    Article 8 that he has then considered if GEN 3.1, being a provision  of
    the Immigration Rules was met.

21. In light of the material errors in this case I find that  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal Judge should be set aside.

22. In circumstances where the  correct  test  has  not  been  applied  and
    findings need  to  be  made  on  issues  such  as  unjustifiably  harsh
    consequences and exceptional circumstances, I think it  is  appropriate
    that the case be remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal for rehearing
    in its entirety.

23. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  does  contain  material
    error of law and is set aside  in  its  entirety.   The  matter  to  be
    remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal for rehearing before a  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge other than First-tier Tribunal Judge Woolley.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge Woolley does contain  material
error of law and is set aside in its entirety.  The case  is  remitted  back
to the First-tier Tribunal for  rehearing  before  any  First-tier  Tribunal
Judge other than First-tier Tribunal Judge Woolley.

The First-tier Tribunal Judge did not make  any  directions  in  respect  of
anonymity and no such direction has been sought before me  and  therefore  I
do not give any directions for anonymity.
