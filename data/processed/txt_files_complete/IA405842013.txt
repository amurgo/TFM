For the Appellant:     Ms A. Fujiwala, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr B Singh, HSBS Solicitors

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    The Claimant is a national of India, born on 25 May 1969.  He  arrived
in the United Kingdom on 8 January 1995 and claimed asylum  on  2  May  1995
but this application was refused and his appeal against  this  decision  was
dismissed in 1997. Thereafter, the Claimant remained in the United  Kingdom.
He married a British  national  but  that  relationship  subsequently  broke
down. The Claimant was granted discretionary leave to remain on  13  January
2010 for  3  years.  He  applied  for  further  leave  to  remain  but  this
application was refused on 18 September 2013. The Claimant appealed  against
this decision and his appeal  was  heard  and  allowed  by  the  First  Tier
Tribunal on 10 April 2014. The Respondent sought and obtained permission  to
appeal to the Upper Tribunal and her appeal was subsequently  allowed  in  a
decision promulgated on 8 August 2014 and remitted back to  the  First  Tier
Tribunal. In so doing, Upper Tribunal Judge Jordan found that this  did  not
mean further findings of fact needed to be made and preserved those made  by
the First Tier Tribunal at [29]-[31].

2.    The appeal then came  before  First  Tier  Tribunal  Judge  C.  A.  S.
O'Garro for hearing on 15 May 2015. In a decision  promulgated  on  18  June
2015, she allowed the appeal. The  Respondent  again  sought  permission  to
appeal from the Upper Tribunal on the basis that: (i) the  Judge's  approach
to paragraph 276ADE(vi) was misconceived in respect of her understanding  of
'ties' in light of the decision in Bossadi [2015] UKUT 00042 (IAC) at  [16];
(ii) at [46] she considered the Claimant's case under Article 8 outside  the
Rules without identifying any circumstances not covered by  the  Rules  that
would warrant consideration; (iii) she  erroneously  applied  the  Chikwamba
principle to the proportionality exercise, contrary to Chen IJR [2015]  UKUT
000189 at [39] and (iv) the Judge's approach to section 117B  was  erroneous
in light of the decision  in  AM  (Malawi)  [2015]  UKUT  0260.  (IAC)  This
application was granted on 25 August 2015 on three grounds: (i),  (iii)  and
(iv).

Hearing

3.    At the hearing before me, Ms Fijiwala submitted  that  the  Judge  had
failed to properly engage with paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules  or
the decision in Bossadi [2015] UKUT 00042 at [13]. She  submitted  that  the
Judge had defined the meaning of "ties" too restrictively given that at  43]
she found that the Claimant had parents and sister in India, who  would  not
be able to support him and at [42] that he had little  or  no  knowledge  of
how things  are  done  in  India  due  to  his  absence  and  necessary  for
integration.

4.    Ms Fijiwala sought to rely on Ground  2  of  the  grounds  of  appeal,
albeit in granting permission to appeal First Tier  Tribunal  Judge  Ransley
found this to have little merit. She submitted that  SS  Congo  [2015]  EWCA
Civ 387 held at [44] that there was a 3 stage approach  in  considering  the
case outside the Rules and there has to be substantive consideration of  the
Rules first and there has to be  a  reasonably  arguable  case  to  consider
outside the Rules. She submitted that the length  of  residence  is  already
considered under the Rules and the Judge's finding at [45] that an  18  year
stay constituted an exceptional circumstance was not justifiable given  that
the Respondent has set the Rule at 20 years. Even if it was correct for  the
Judge to consider Article 8 outside the Rules  she  should  have  considered
the public interest set out in the Rules over and above section 117  of  the
NIAA 2002.

5.    In respect of Ground 3 and the Judge's reliance  on  Chikwamba  [2008]
UKHL 41 at [63]-[64] of the determination, she submitted that the Judge  has
not properly engaged with it in light of the decision  in  Chen  IJR  [2015]
UKUT 00189 at [39]. She submitted that it was a 2 limb consideration and  it
needed to be shown by an individual that entry clearance from  abroad  would
be granted and there  was  nothing  at  [63]-[64]  to  show  that  an  entry
clearance application would  be  successful,  especially  as  there  was  no
evidence that the Claimant's partner would meet  Appendix  FM  in  terms  of
maintenance and accommodation. It had not been shown  that  there  would  be
interference with family life caused by temporary removal.

6.    In respect of Ground  4  and  section  117B  of  the  NIAA  2002,  she
submitted that at [59] the Judge finds there  was  no  evidence  before  her
that the Claimant could speak English but she made an  assumption  based  on
the length of his residence and because at [60] that  he  has  been  working
with his brother. She relied on  AM  (Malawi)  [2015]  UKUT  0260  (IAC)  in
support of the contention that this did not give rise to  a  positive  right
to remain and that the Judge had  further  erred  in  attaching  significant
weight to the Claimant's financial independence,  whereas  in  light  of  AM
(Malawi) these should have been taken as neutral factors. She  responded  to
the Rule 24 response, in that 20 years has to be completed before  the  date
of application and so paragraph 276ADE(iii) does not apply  because  at  the
time of the application the Claimant had been in the UK only 18 years.

7.    On behalf of the Claimant, Mr Singh relied on his reply  at  [7]-[11].
He submitted that the Judge re-assessed  and  took  all  the  evidence  into
consideration and provided a detailed analysis of the case. He  pointed  out
that the Claimant had been granted  3  years  Discretionary  Leave  but  his
marriage broke down and there  had  been  no  deception  on  his  part.  His
credibility was accepted by the  previous  First  Tier  Tribunal  and  Judge
Jordan maintained those findings at [29]-[31]. The Judge at  [43]  addressed
paragraph 276ADE gave reasons for her finding. The Claimant  has  only  been
once to India and he does not know the norms.  These  were  the  exceptional
circumstances considered  by  the  Judge.  He  submitted  that  the  caselaw
supported her decision and that she looked  at  Appendix  FM.  He  submitted
that the Judge  had  gone  on  to  consider  Article  and  the  decision  in
Ganesabalan at [46]. He submitted that there was  no  reasoning  as  to  why
these findings are not correct and that when the caselaw  is  looked  at  in
its totality there was no error of law.

Decision

8.    I found a material error of law in Judge's decision and I now give  my
reasons for so finding. I find that the Judge did fail  to  correctly  apply
paragraph 276ADE (vi) of the Immigration Rules, in respect of the  issue  of
whether the Claimant has ties with  India,  including  social,  cultural  or
family ties. The Judge held at [42] that: "after  20  years  of  absence  he
would have little or no knowledge of how things are done in India  in  terms
of employment, borrowing money and setting up a home which are the  elements
necessary for integration." And at [43] "The appellant  parents  still  live
in India but they are retired living on limited  income.  In  fact  he  said
that he sent money regularly from his earnings to support them. I find  that
they would be able to offer him little or no  support  on  his  return.  His
sister is married and as she is now attached to her husband's  family  which
is the culture in India, she would be in no position to  offer  any  support
for the appellant. I find that the  appellant  will  be  expected  to  start
afresh looking to re-establish himself in a country where  he  has  no  real
ties." Whilst I accept that the Claimant's sister may be unable  to  support
him, I consider that  the  Judge  misdirected  herself  in  respect  of  his
parents. As the Judge acknowledged at [42] setting up a home is one  of  the
key elements necessary for re-integration however, she failed  to  make  any
finding as to why the Claimant would be unable to live with his  parents  at
least in the short term. I further find that she erred in finding that  they
would be able to offer him little  or  no  support  on  his  return,  absent
detailed consideration of this question and the role of  emotional  support,
albeit they would be unable to provide financial support. Whilst  the  Judge
at [39]-[41] of her decision referred  to  the  relevant  jurisprudence  viz
Ogundimu [2013] UKUT 00060 (IAC); YM  (Uganda)  [2014]  EWCA  Civ  1292  and
Bossadi [2015] UKUT 00042 at [13] I do not consider  that  she  conducted  a
rounded assessment that is both objectively and subjectively founded.

9.    In respect of Ground 2 of the grounds of appeal, I  agree  with  First
Tier Tribunal Judge Ransley that this has little merit. At  [45]  the  Judge
made an express finding that the Respondent has failed to properly  consider
the Claimant's exceptional circumstances in  that  he  has  resided  in  the
United Kingdom for over 18  years  at  the  date  of  decision  and  has  an
established private and family life. These were findings of  fact  preserved
by Upper Tribunal Judge Jordan from the  decision  of  First  Tier  Tribunal
Judge Trevaskis and it was open to First  Tier  Tribunal  Judge  O'Garro  to
find that these constituted exceptional  circumstances,  particularly  given
that the Claimant was eligible at the time of  the  hearing  before  her  to
make an application for leave to remain pursuant  to  paragraph  276ADE(iii)
based on 20 years continuous residence.

10.   In respect of Ground 3 and the Judge's reliance  on  Chikwamba  [2008]
UKHL 41 at [63]-[64] of the  determination,  Ms  Fijiwala's  submission  was
that the Judge has not properly engaged with this  issue  in  light  of  the
decision in Chen IJR [2015] UKUT 00189  at  [39];  that  it  was  a  2  limb
consideration and it had not been shown that  entry  clearance  from  abroad
would be granted or that  there  would  be  interference  with  family  life
caused by temporary removal. I have considered the decision in  Chen  but  I
do not find it of assistance on the  facts  of  this  case.  In  R  (on  the
application of Thakral) v The Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department
IJR [2015] UKUT 00096 (IAC) Mr Justice Nicol made clear at [11]  that:  "The
Chikwamba principle is only engaged if, in the terms of paragraph  [30]  (a)
of Hayat,  the  SSHD  has  refused  the  application  in  question  "on  the
procedural ground that the policy requires that the  applicant  should  have
made the application from his home state." The Claimant sought to  vary  his
discretionary leave to  remain.  He  made  this  application  prior  to  the
commencement of his relationship with Ms W and to date, the  Respondent  has
not  considered  the  effect  of  this  relationship  with  regard  to   the
Claimant's immigration status at  all.  Consequently,  the  Chikwamba  issue
simply did not arise for consideration before the  Judge.  Moreover,  it  is
clear from the jurisprudence as a whole, from Chikwamba  onwards,  that  the
issue is a fact sensitive one and the Judge was not  in  possession  of  all
the material facts, such as whether or not the  requirements  of  R-LTRP  of
the Immigration Rules in respect of partners were met.  She  further  failed
to make any finding as to the prospective length and  degree  of  disruption
of family life between the Claimant and Ms W.  For  these  reasons,  I  find
that the First Tier Tribunal Judge materially  erred  in  finding  that  the
Chikwamba principle was engaged as part of  the  Article  8  proportionality
exercise.

11.   I further find that the Judge erred materially in law for the  reasons
put forward at Ground 4 regarding the application  of  section  117B(2)  and
(3) of the NIAA 2002.  There was no evidence before  the  Judge  to  justify
her  finding  at  [59]  that  the  Claimant  "must  have  achieved  a   good
understanding of English Language" due to his long residence and  employment
in the United Kingdom. She acknowledged as much but  based  her  finding  on
assumption, which is impermissible. She was entitled to find  at  [60]  that
the Claimant is financially independent because she heard evidence from  him
and his brother that she accepted as credible,  that  he  had  been  working
with his brother in his business. Ms Fijwala relied on the  decision  in  AM
(Malawi) [2015] UKUT 0260 (IAC) in support of the contention that  this  did
not give rise to a positive right to remain and that the Judge had erred  in
that these should have been taken as "neutral  factors."  However,  this  is
not an entirely correct understanding of  AM  (Malawi)  at  [18]  where  the
Upper Tribunal held that the Respondent is not precluded from  relying  upon
fluency in English or financial  independence  as  public  interest  factors
against the claimant  unless  the  claimant  could  demonstrate  fluency  or
financial independence to the level of  the  requirements  set  out  in  the
Immigration Rules. There was no English  language  test  certificate  before
the Judge and the  witness  statements  of  the  claimant  and  his  brother
indicates that he  earns  �1000  per  month,  which  is  below  the  �18,600
required to sponsor a partner, albeit I note that this  amount  would  apply
to his partner rather then to the  claimant  directly.  In  any  event,  the
Judge neither referred to nor applied the principles set out in AM  (Malawi)
and thus materially erred in law for this reason.

12.   Given that this appeal has been heard by the First  Tier  Tribunal  on
two occasions and has come before the Upper Tribunal  on  two  occasions,  I
have decided to re-make the decision myself rather than to remit the  appeal
to the First Tier Tribunal for a third occasion, as  I  consider  there  are
sufficient findings  of  fact  upon  which  I  can  reach  a  decision.  The
established findings of fact, preserved by Upper Tribunal Judge  Jordan  are
at [29]-[31] of the decision of First Tier Tribunal Judge Trevaskis:

    (i)    the Claimant and his witnesses are credible and consistent;

    (ii)   the Claimant has been residing in the United Kingdom since 1995;

    (iii)  he was granted discretionary leave in 2010 for 3 years primarily
    based upon his family life with his wife, however, it is clear that  he
    had a close and supportive relationship  with  his  brother  which  had
    existed since his arrival in the United Kingdom and  that  was  also  a
    material part of his family and private life at the time of  the  grant
    of that leave;

    (iv)   his relationship with  Ms  W  post  dated  his  application  for
    further discretionary leave in  January  2014  but  they  met  and  the
    relationship had blossomed and they had decided to  live  together  and
    marry by the time of the refusal decision on 18 September  2013.  There
    is no evidence the respondent has  considered  the  existence  of  that
    relationship or its relevance to his case.

13.   I further find that the finding of First Tier Tribunal  Judge  O'Garro
at [33] that the Claimant has submitted credible evidence that he  is  in  a
subsisting relationship with his partner has  not  been  challenged  by  the
Respondent.

14.   The issues before me are:

    (i)    whether the Claimant meets the requirements of  the  Immigration
    Rules;

    (ii)   whether or not  removal  of  the  Claimant  to  India  would  be
    proportionate,  it  having  been  accepted  that   the   Claimant   has
    established a private and family life with his partner, brother and his
    brother's family in the United Kingdom.

15.   Whilst at the date of the hearing and decision of  Judge  O'Garro  the
Claimant did not meet the "partner" requirements of Appendix FM he  now  may
meet  those  requirements  due  to  the  passage  of  time.    However,   R-
LTRP.1.1.(b)  provides  that:  "the  applicant  must  have  made   a   valid
application for limited or indefinite leave to remain  as  a  partner."  The
current appeal is in respect of an application  to  vary  his  discretionary
leave to remain and to date, the Claimant has not made  an  application  for
leave to remain with his current partner under the provisions of the  Rules.
Therefore, this is not a matter before me and even if  it  were  before  me,
the evidence does not establish that the financial  requirements  of  R-LTRP
are met.

16.   I turn next to the issue of the Claimant's  residence  in  the  United
Kingdom since his arrival in the  United  Kingdom  on  8  January  1995.  He
entered clandestinely thus there is no record  of  his  entry,  however,  he
made an asylum claim in May 1995 and the Respondent in her refusal  decision
appears to treat his date of entry as  8  January  1995.  He  has  thus  now
resided in the United Kingdom for more than 20 years.  The  current  version
of paragraph 276ADE provides:

    "Requirements to be met by an applicant for  leave  to  remain  on  the
    grounds of private life

    276ADE (1). The requirements to be met by an  applicant  for  leave  to
    remain on the grounds of private life in the UK are that at the date of
    application, the applicant:

         (i)      does not fall for refusal under  any  of  the  grounds  in
         Section S LTR1.2 to S-LTR 2.3. and S-LTR.3.1. in Appendix FM; and

         (ii)     has made a valid application for leave to  remain  on  the
         grounds of private life in the UK; and

         (iii)    has lived continuously in the UK for  at  least  20  years
         (discounting any period of imprisonment); or

         (iv)     is under the age of 18 years and has lived continuously in
         the  UK  for  at  least  7  years  (discounting   any   period   of
         imprisonment)  and  it  would  not  be  reasonable  to  expect  the
         applicant to leave the UK; or

         (v)      is aged 18 years or above and under 25 years and has spent
         at  least  half  of  his  life  living  continuously  in   the   UK
         (discounting any period of imprisonment); or

         (vi)     subject to sub-paragraph (2), is aged 18 years  or  above,
         has  lived  continuously  in  the  UK  for  less  than   20   years
         (discounting any period of imprisonment) but there  would  be  very
         significant obstacles  to  the  applicant's  integration  into  the
         country to which he would have to go if required to leave the UK".

17.   First Tier Tribunal Judge O'Garro declined to find in  the  Claimant's
favour in respect of paragraph 276ADE(iii) on the basis that at the date  of
application he had resided in the United Kingdom for 18  years  rather  than
20 years. However, I have had regard to paragraph 276A0 of the  Rules  which
provides:

    "For the purposes of paragraph 276ADE(1)  the  requirement  to  make  a
    valid application will not apply when the Article 8 claim is raised:

         (i)      ...

         (ii)     ...

         (iii)    in an appeal (subject to the consent of the  Secretary  of
         State where applicable).

Article 8 was considered by the Respondent in her  refusal  decision  of  18
September 2013 and was clearly raised by the  Claimant  in  his  grounds  of
appeal to the First  Tier  Tribunal  dated  1  October  2013  and  thus  the
requirement to make a valid application for  leave  to  remain  pursuant  to
paragraph 276ADE, which he has not done to date, does not apply.

18.   Therefore, I find that the Claimant has resided in the United  Kingdom
since 8 January 1995 and has therefore resided in the United Kingdom for  in
excess of 20 years. In respect of  the  continuity  of  his  residence,  the
evidence indicates that he has only left the  United  Kingdom  once,  for  a
visit to his parents in India in January 2011. This was at a  time  when  he
had discretionary leave to remain both upon departure and  return  and  thus
the continuity of his residence was not interrupted.  It  follows  that  the
Claimant meets the requirements of  paragraph  276ADE(iii)  and  his  appeal
against he decision of the Respondent dated 18 September 2013  falls  to  be
allowed on this basis. In light of  my  finding  that  the  appeal  succeeds
under the paragraph  276ADE  (iii)  Immigration  Rules  I  do  not  need  to
consider whether he  meets  the  requirements  of  paragraph  276ADE(vi)  or
whether or not removal of the Claimant to India would be a  disproportionate
interference with his right to family and private life, contrary to  article
8 of ECHR.

Decision

19.    The  Claimant's  appeal  against  the  Respondent's  decision  of  18
September 2013 is allowed under the Immigration Rules.
