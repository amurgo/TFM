Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr C Lim, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.  The  appellants,  husband  and  wife,  are  citizens  of   India,   born
   respectively on 19 November 1986 and 18 November  1988.  They  have  been
   given permission  to  appeal  against  the  determination  of  First-tier
   Tribunal Judge Callow dismissing their appeals against  the  respondent's
   decision to refuse the first appellant's application for leave to  remain
   in the United Kingdom as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant and  the  second
   appellant's application as the Partner of a Tier 1 Migrant.

2. The first appellant (from hereinafter referred  to  as  "the  appellant")
   entered the United Kingdom on 31 August 2009 with leave  to  enter  as  a
   Tier 4 General Student and was granted further leave to remain as a  Tier
   1 Post Study Work Migrant until 13 July 2013. On 12 July 2013 he  applied
   for further leave to remain as  a  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)  Migrant.  His
   application was refused on 5 September 2013.

3. The application was refused under paragraph 245DD(b) of  the  immigration
   rules  on  the  grounds  that  the  appellant  was  unable  to  meet  the
   requirements to be awarded a minimum of 75 points under  Appendix  A.  He
   was awarded zero points for access  to  funds  as  the  evidence  he  had
   provided, namely a bank statement from Barclays Bank, did  not  meet  the
   criteria specified under paragraph 41-SD(a)(ii) since it  did  not  state
   his name and his team member's name but only stated the business name and
   he had failed to demonstrate that he had invested the money.

4. The appellant appealed against that decision and the appeal was heard  in
   the First-tier Tribunal by Judge Callow. The focus of the appeal was upon
   the documentary evidence consisting of the bank statement which  was  for
   an account in the name of Kavit Consultancy Ltd issued by  Barclays  Bank
   on 11 July 2013 which recorded a balance of �50,000 made up of a transfer
   of �25,000 from a current account  said  to  be  the  appellant's  and  a
   further �25,000  transferred  by  the  appellant's  entrepreneurial  team
   member Kwinkalkumar Patel. The  statement  was  endorsed  by  the  branch
   manager, confirming that Kwinkalkumar Patel was one of two  directors  on
   the account and  had  full  access  to  the  funds.  There  was  a  short
   adjournment of the hearing to enable Mr Lim and the appellant  to  attend
   at Barclays Bank in order to obtain  a  letter  on  official  letter-head
   confirming the availability to the appellant of the funds in the business
   account. Mr Lim produced a statement to the Tribunal confirming that  the
   bank would not issue a letter as they considered  the  statement  already
   produced as being on official letter-head and as being in accordance with
   their guidelines. The judge, referring to  paragraph  41-SD(c)(i),  found
   that the bank statement did not meet the relevant evidential requirements
   and accordingly dismissed the appeal under the immigration rules. He went
   on to consider Article 8 but dismissed the appeal on that ground as well.

5. Permission to appeal that decision was sought on behalf of the  appellant
   on the ground that the judge had erred by finding that the  document  did
   not meet the criteria in paragraph 41-SD(c)(i) as a "letter" and that  he
   should have considered the document under the provisions of paragraph 41-
   SD(c)(ii) which related to bank statements.

6. Permission to appeal was initially refused but was  subsequently  granted
   on a renewed application on 11 April 2014.  With  that  application,  the
   appellant produced a copy of a similar bank  statement  endorsed  by  the
   branch manager with confirmation that he was one of the directors on  the
   account. It was stated that he had not realised that he was in possession
   of the document as the original had been retained by the Home Office.

Appeal hearing and submissions

7. At the hearing we pointed out to the parties that  the  judge's  findings
   appeared to have proceeded on the basis of the  wrong  immigration  rule,
   namely paragraph 41-SD(c), rather than paragraph 41-SD(a).  The  contents
   of both were broadly similar but the latter  was  the  relevant  rule  in
   force at the time of the refusal decision. That same error also  appeared
   in  Mr  Lim's  grounds  of  appeal  before  us.  Accordingly  we  invited
   submissions on the matter.

8. Mr Lim did not disagree but submitted further that the  judge  had  erred
   in law by considering only the requirement in the immigration rules for a
   bank letter and by  failing  to  recognise  that  the  immigration  rules
   required in the alternative a bank statement. The judge did not have  the
   benefit of the bank statement adduced with the permission application but
   that was not the appellant's fault as the Home Office  had  retained  the
   documents produced with his application and had failed to return them  to
   him. The bank statement contained all the necessary information  to  meet
   the  evidential  requirements  of  the  rules  and  confirmed  the  funds
   available to the appellant. Mr Lim went on to submit that the  evidential
   flexibility requirements of the rules required the Home  Office  to  have
   made further enquiries of the appellant as to the availability of  funds,
   but they did not do so. The signed endorsement from the bank  manager  on
   the bank statement provided reasonable grounds for considering  that  the
   appellant had the funds and therefore enquiries should have been made  of
   him. Even if that issue was not raised before the judge, he  should  have
   considered the matter. Mr Lim said that he now had a letter from the bank
   confirming that the appellant had the available funds. He sought to admit
   the letter, which he advised us was dated 10 June 2014.  Given  that  the
   letter had not been before the First-tier Tribunal we did not consider it
   relevant to the error of law issue.

9. Mr Bramble accepted that there had been an  error  of  law  in  that  the
   judge had relied on the wrong rule. However he submitted that  the  error
   was not material as the appellant could not in any  event  have  met  the
   requirements of the rules.  With  regard  to  paragraph  41-SD(a)(ii)  he
   accepted that the appellant had submitted, together with his application,
   his business bank statement endorsed by the bank  manager  and  that  the
   document had therefore been before the Secretary of State,  although  not
   before the First-tier Tribunal. The  bank  statement,  however,  did  not
   conform to the evidential requirements in paragraph 41-SD(a)(ii)(4) as it
   was in the business name and not in the names of the entrepreneurial team
   members. Neither could it be considered as a letter for the  purposes  of
   41-SD(a)(i) as it did not state the appellant's  name  and  that  of  his
   partner and it did not confirm the amount of money available. By  putting
   the money into an account in the name of the business, the appellant  had
   brought himself into paragraph  45  and  therefore  needed  to  meet  the
   requirements of paragraph 46-SD, which he could not do.  With  regard  to
   paragraph 245AA the evidential flexibility provisions did  not  apply  to
   the appellant's circumstances.

10. In response,  Mr  Lim  submitted  that  the  document  fell  within  the
   evidential flexibility provisions as it was in the wrong format, but  the
   bank would not issue a letter at the time. The respondent ought  to  have
   requested a typed letter from the bank. The bank had now  issued  such  a
   letter.

Consideration and findings.

11. As we advised the parties, we  preferred  the  submissions  made  by  Mr
   Bramble and considered that, whilst Judge Callow erred by looking at  the
   wrong immigration rule and by failing to consider the  alternative  to  a
   letter from the bank,  namely  a  bank  statement,  as  provided  for  in
   paragraph 41-SD(a)(ii),  the  appellant  could  not  in  any  event  have
   succeeded under the correct  rule  and  the  error  was  accordingly  not
   material.

12.  Mr Lim's grounds before us maintained that the appellant  was  able  to
   meet the requirements of paragraph 41-SD(c)(ii) as he had produced a bank
   statement showing a balance of �50,000 in  funds  available  to  him.  As
   established at the hearing, the relevant rule was in fact  paragraph  41-
   SD(a)(ii). That rule provided,  at  paragraph  41-SD(a)(ii)(4)  that  the
   account had to be in the names of the entrepreneurial team members. Given
   that the bank statement was not in the name  of  the  appellant  and  his
   partner, but in the name of  the  business  Kavit  Consultancy  Ltd,  the
   document plainly did not meet the evidential requirements of  the  rules.
   Mr Lim made no submissions challenging that conclusion.

13. Neither did Mr Lim seek to  make  any  particularised  challenge  to  Mr
   Bramble's  submission  that  the  document  also  failed  to   meet   the
   requirements of paragraph 41-SD(a)(i). Clearly the  document  was  not  a
   letter falling within those provisions. In fact the only document  before
   Judge Callow was that at page 10.1 of the appeal bundle,  namely  a  bank
   statement referring to the appellant's business partner and endorsed with
   confirmation from the branch manager that his  partner  was  one  of  two
   directors on the account. Whilst the bank statement showed  two  deposits
   of �25,000 made into the account, only one of those  deposits  identified
   the source of the funds, namely his business partner. Although Mr Bramble
   accepted that the Home Office had been provided  with  a  bank  statement
   endorsed with a similar confirmation in the appellant's name that was not
   before the judge at the time and was only provided by the appellant  with
   the permission application. In any event, that bank statement  again  did
   not identify the appellant as the source of one of the �25,000  deposits.



14. Mr Lim did not challenge Mr  Bramble's  submission  that  the  appellant
   had, by putting money into an  account  in  the  name  of  the  business,
   brought himself into paragraph 45 of the rules and thereby subject to the
   evidential requirements of paragraph 46-SD,  which  he  could  not  meet.
   Clearly Mr Bramble was correct in so submitting.

15. The focus of Mr Lim's challenge before us was  in  fact  the  evidential
   flexibility provisions of paragraph 245AA of the rules. However that  was
   not a matter raised before Judge Callow. When we put that to Mr Lim,  his
   response was that the judge ought nevertheless  to  have  considered  the
   matter himself. We do not agree. It was not an obvious point and  had  it
   been one that the appellant was pursuing it was up to his  representative
   to make relevant submissions before the judge. In any event  neither  the
   grounds seeking permission to appeal put before the  First-tier  Tribunal
   nor those before the Upper Tribunal sought to  challenge  Judge  Callow's
   determination in that respect.

16. We do not, in any event, find any merit in the submission and  we  agree
   with Mr Bramble that the appellant's circumstances did  not  fall  within
   the provisions of  paragraph  245AA.  We  do  not  agree  that  the  bank
   statement at page 10.1 of the appeal bundle  could  be  considered  as  a
   letter in the wrong format or even that a combination  of  that  document
   and the bank statement produced with the permission application could  be
   so considered. The reason why the document did not meet the  requirements
   of paragraph 41-SD(a)(i) was that, aside from the matter of format, there
   was clearly significant and relevant information missing. That was not  a
   matter that could be resolved through those provisions by the  submission
   of subsequent documentation from the bank, as Mr Lim sought to do.

17. In all of the circumstances,  and  on  the  evidence  available  to  the
   judge, we find that he was entitled to conclude that  the  appellant  was
   unable to meet the evidential requirements of the rules.  Indeed  he  was
   unable to conclude otherwise. Accordingly the grounds of appeal  disclose
   no material errors of law in his decision.

DECISION

18. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  did  not  involve
   an error on a point of law such that it should be set aside.  Accordingly
   we do not set aside the decision. The  decision  to  dismiss  the  appeal
   stands.
