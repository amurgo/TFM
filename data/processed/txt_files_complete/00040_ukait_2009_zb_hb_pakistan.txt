For the Respondent:          Mr D. Hunt-Jackson, Home Office Presenting
Officer




   A marriage that is otherwise valid is not rendered void by  demonstration
   of the incapacity of one of the parties at the time of the ceremony;  but
   a marriage that is valid may, in special circumstances (which may or  may
   not relate to capacity) not be entitled to recognition as such.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The first appellant is a citizen of Pakistan and the  second  appellant
    is her infant son.  They appeal to the Tribunal against the decision of
    the respondent on 16 April 2007 refusing them entry  clearance  to  the
    United Kingdom as the wife and son of the sponsor.

 2. The grounds for the refusal, which we treat in more detail below,  were
    that the respondent was not satisfied that the first appellant and  the
    sponsor intended to live together permanently as husband and  wife  and
    that the marriage was subsisting; or  that  either  of  the  appellants
    would be maintained and accommodated  adequately  without  recourse  to
    public funds.  At an earlier hearing in relation to  this  appeal,  the
    respondent's representative indicated that she proposed in addition  to
    argue that the marriage between the appellant and  sponsor  was  either
    not valid or not entitled to recognition in the  United  Kingdom.   The
    hearing did not, as a result, proceed on that occasion.  Mr Mohammed on
    behalf of  the  appellants  raised  two  principal  objections  to  the
    respondent's course of action.  He said, first, that the respondent was
    not entitled to raise a substantial new issue so late,  and,  secondly,
    that he suspected that the  Tribunal  was  tolerating  conduct  in  the
    management of appeals by the respondent that it would not  tolerate  in
    the case of an appellant.  We fully understand Mr Mohammed's concern in
    raising those points, but we are quite satisfied that neither  of  them
    has any substance.  So far as concerns the first, it is  not  right  to
    say, as Mr Mohammed does in his letter, that the decision of  Glidewell
    J in R v Immigration Appeal Tribunal ex parte Kwok on Tong  [1981]  Imm
    AR 214 has been superseded.  On the contrary, it is clearly  good  law,
    and has recently been re-emphasised by the Tribunal in RM [2006]  UKAIT
    00039.  Those are not the only authorities for the proposition that the
    respondent's notice of decision is not a pleading:  provided  that  the
    appellant is given a proper opportunity to deal with any new points, it
    is open to the respondent to open  new  points,  and  the  Tribunal  is
    obliged to deal with them, because it cannot allow an appeal against  a
    non-discretionary decision unless satisfied that the decision was  'not
    in accordance with the law (including Immigration  Rules)':  those  are
    the words of s 86(3)(a) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act
    2002.

 3. The second point is more troubling.  It is fair  to  say  that  at  the
    hearing before us  Mr.  Mohammed  did  not  press  it.   Certainly  the
    Tribunal as presently constituted for the purposes of this appeal would
    be surprised  to  hear  that  the  respondent  or  her  representatives
    consider that they are treated with greater tolerance  in  breaches  of
    the Rules than appellants are.  It would need a great deal more than  a
    simple assertion to establish that proposition, and it is in any  event
    not relevant to deciding this appeal.  We say no more about it:  it  is
    clear that the appellants need to deal with the points  raised  by  the
    respondent at various stages, and they have now had  adequate  time  to
    deal with them.  We should say at this point that both  representatives
    before us agreed that  we  should,  following  the  conclusion  of  the
    hearing, proceed to determine the appeal on the basis of  the  evidence
    available to us, all of which is in writing.

 4. The sponsor is severely disabled.  There is evidence about the level of
    his disability, to which we shall refer in due course.  He was born  in
    February 1980, and so at the date of the  decision  against  which  the
    appellants appeal he was 27 years old.  He and the first appellant  are
    second cousins.  He went to Pakistan for about ten weeks in the  Spring
    of 2003, during which time it is said that he and the  first  appellant
    became engaged to be married.  He  went  again  on  4  May  2004.   The
    sponsor and the first appellant went through a ceremony of marriage  on
    9 May and the sponsor remained in Pakistan until 8  June.   The  second
    appellant was born to  the  first  appellant  on  1  March  2005.   The
    appellant has been to Pakistan again since the decision  under  appeal,
    remaining for about a month.

 5. The notice of refusal in this case is quite full, and Mr  Mohammed  did
    not suggest to us that it is inaccurate in recording the evidence as it
    was before the Entry Clearance Officer.  The major part  of  it  is  as
    follows:

      "You married your sponsor on 09.05.04 and I  note  that  your  sponsor
        stayed in Pakistan until 08.06.04 which is the time  you  saw  him.
        You claim that since your sponsor has  been  in  the  UK  you  have
        remained in regular contact via telephone, every  second  or  third
        day between an hour and two hours  at  a  time  (Q13).   Given  the
        distance between you and your sponsor it should be reasonable in  a
        subsisting and genuine relationship for an open discussion to  take
        place about your lives, history and backgrounds.  The fact that you
        demonstrated little knowledge of your sponsor does  not  correspond
        with the assertion of  frequent  contact  nor  does  it  reflect  a
        subsisting and genuine relationship.  At interview you  were  asked
        about your sponsor's medical condition; however,  you  displayed  a
        significant lack of knowledge in this regard.   As  stated  in  his
        Doctor's  letter  dated  08.02.07,  your   sponsor   suffers   from
        "...Misocephaly  [swelling  of  the  brain]  with   severe   mental
        retardation as well as physical disability.   He  also  has  severe
        learning difficulties and attend day  care  centre  because  he  is
        totally unable to look after himself physically".  I also note your
        legal representatives in the UK have stated that your  sponsor  has
        limited comprehension and communication.  Given  the  magnitude  of
        his disability and the effect it has  on  his  life  it  should  be
        reasonable to expect that you would have some  knowledge  regarding
        this.  When you were asked about your sponsor's illness, you merely
        stated he was disabled (Q16).  You were then asked  to  explain  in
        what way he was disabled, to which you stated that "he has weakness
        in his arms and also mentally sometimes he  is  fine"  (Q17).   You
        also stated that he could change his  own  clothes  and  take  food
        (Q28) however this goes against the  diagnosis  of  his  doctor  as
        mentioned in his  letter  dated  08.02.07.    You  were  unable  to
        correctly state what care and  medication  he  receives  (Q28-Q29).
        When you were asked how you maintain such contact with your sponsor
        when he has limited communication  skills  you  admitted  that  you
        actually speak to your  mother-in-law  and  not  your  husband  via
        telephone (Q13 & Q24-Q25).  At interview you were  also  given  the
        opportunity to tell us what you know about  your  sponsor  and  his
        life in the UK that was not related to  his  illness,  however  you
        were unable to answer these questions  (Q36-Q37).   You  were  then
        specifically  asked  about  your  sponsor's  likes,   hobbies   and
        interests.  You stated that he liked to play and  had  no  interest
        (Q38).  You  were  asked  about  what  you  and  your  sponsor  had
        discussed about the area he lives in the UK and where you and  your
        son propose to reside.  You were only able to tell us that he had a
        double storey house (Q41-Q43).  Given that you have been married to
        your sponsor for almost three years, such a  paucity  of  knowledge
        does not correspond with the assertion  of  frequent  contact.  281
        (iii) HC 395.

      You were also asked at interview to tell us why  your  parents  agreed
        with this marriage for you.  You stated this was because you  liked
        your sponsor (Q44).  You were then asked to tell us what it was you
        liked about him and the only reason you have was that "his eyes are
        beautiful" (Q45).  You were unable to  explain  how  you  and  your
        sponsor have maintained a relationship while he has been in the  UK
        given that you are unable to speak to him and only  speak  to  your
        mother-in-law (Q26).  Your response to this question was  that  "He
        [sponsor] was our relative and that is why this all  happened."   I
        have taken into consideration  the  fact  that  your  marriage  was
        traditionally arranged and that you and your  sponsor  are  related
        outside marriage.  However, these points  in  your  favour  do  not
        outweigh my doubts concerning your  intentions  to  live  together,
        given your lack of knowledge regarding your  sponsor  and  lack  of
        intervening devotion.  281 (iii)

      I acknowledge that you and your sponsor have  a  child  together  born
        01.03.05.  However, I have to take  into  consideration  that  your
        sponsor has not sought to visit you or  the  child  since  he  left
        Pakistan on 08.06.04, one month after the wedding.  I  consider  it
        reasonable that, were you genuinely intending to live together,  he
        would have stayed in Pakistan with  you  for  more  than  just  one
        month, given that he has no employment commitments  or  would  have
        returned for at least a visit.  Furthermore you  have  also  failed
        to provide a credible explanation as to why it has taken you almost
        three years after marriage to submit to this application to joining
        your sponsor, other than "I submitted the case  but  it  got  late"
        (Q36).  I do not consider this to be the reasonable  conduct  of  a
        couple who genuinely intend to live together. 281 (iii) HC 395.

      My doubts regarding the subsistence of  your  relationship  have  been
        compounded by your lack of knowledge regarding  your  spouse's  ill
        health.  I consider that were  you  in  a  genuine  and  subsisting
        relationship you would be better aware of his medical problems.   I
        accept that without being informed of  these  you  cannot  possibly
        know  however  this  then  calls  into   question   your   spouse's
        intentions.  If he considered this to be a genuine marriage I would
        expect him or his family to have  discussed  his  medical  problems
        with you. 281 (iii) HC 395.

      For all the reasons stated above I am not satisfied that each  of  the
        parties intends to live permanently with the other as  his  or  her
        spouse and the marriage is subsisting. 281 (iii) HC 395

      Letters from the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) show that  your
        sponsor is in receipt of �91.85 Income Support per week and  �76.65
        Disability Living Allowance (DLA) per week.

      ...

      Your sponsor is unable to work for the foreseeable future due  to  his
        illness  and  there  is   no   indication   that   you   hold   any
        qualifications,  experience  or  linguistic   ability   to   obtain
        employment in the UK.  On a balance of probabilities it is unlikely
        that you and your spouse  will  be  able  to  maintain  yourselves,
        without recourse to additional public  funds,  shortly  after  your
        arrival in the UK. 281 (v) HC 395"


 6. The notice of decision goes on to deal briefly  with  Article  8.   The
    numbers in bold type at the end  of  each  paragraph  are,  of  course,
    references to the paragraph numbers in  the  Statement  of  Changes  in
    Immigration Rules, HC 395.  The notice of decision in  respect  of  the
    second appellant is shorter.   It  records  the  fact  that  the  first
    appellant's application has  been  refused.   That  is  one  ground  of
    refusal; the other is again maintenance.

 7. We must now set out the medical evidence.  The Entry Clearance  Officer
    had sight of a letter from the sponsor's GP dated 8 February 2007.   It
    reads as follows:

      "This patient suffers from Misocephaly with severe mental  retardation
        as well as physical disability.  Has severe  learning  disabilities
        and attend day care centre because he is  totally  unable  to  look
        after himself physically."

 8. The only other medical evidence is from  another  doctor  at  the  same
    address.  It is in the form  of  answers  to  questions  posed  by  the
    appellants' solicitors, asking for a medical  report  "to  support  the
    patient's case for his spouse's visa entry to the UK".   The  questions
    posed, and the doctor's answer to them, are as follows:

        Q. (a) What illness and/or condition(s) the patient suffers from?
        A.   Learning  difficulties  due  to  congenital   cerebral   palsy
           diagnosed in 1996.
        Q.       (b)What  are  the  mental  and  physical  effects  of  the
           illness/condition(s)?
        A.       [He] is physically fit.  His mobility  is  normal  and  he
           eats and drinks independently.   The  learning  difficulties  he
           exhibits do not affect his physical health.  He is mentally  co-
           operative, he listens carefully and understands  and  agrees  to
           actions appropriately.  He communicates his needs  well  to  his
           mother and brother who both understand him well in return
        Q. (c) Are these curable and if so is the patient under treatment?
        A. His condition is not curable  and  he  is  not  on  any  regular
           medication.  He attends a Day Care Centre regularly.
        Q. (d) Is the patient receiving any prescribed medication and  side
           effects of any such medication?
        A. His is not on any regular medication
        Q. (e) The patient's ability to undertake the following:
           - Personal hygiene and cleansing
           - Physical function
           - Ability to clothe himself
           - Take food and drink by himself
           - Prepare food for himself
           -Ability to communicate effectively
        A. He needs care from his mother and brother with  regards  to  his
           daily routine including showering and shaving.  He can  use  the
           toilet to passport [sic] urine and stool independently.  He  can
           dress himself but needs help with some fine motor skills.  He is
           able to eat and drink independently.  He is able to  communicate
           effectively using spoken language and some sign language.
        Q. (f) Whether the patient requires  day  and/or  night  care  from
           another person?
        A. The patient does need day and night care from another person.
        Q. (g) The patient has fathered a child with his wife in  Pakistan;
           in which case please report on whether the  patient  has  normal
           adult sexual urges and whether he is able  to  understand  these
           and therefore control the urges; or is his body simply driven by
           natural urges?
        A. [He] married in Pakistan about 5 years ago  [Ziatoon  Bibi]  and
           fathered a child [Hamza Ali Bux] on 1.3.04[sic].  His  wife  and
           child remain in Pakistan and he has telephone contact with them.
            He exhibits normal sexual urges and is able to  understand  and
           control them well.
        Q. (h) The consequences or effects of short term/long  term  denial
           of sexual intercourse on the patient?
        A. We have not discussed the consequences or effects of  short/long
           term denial of sexual intercourse but he tells me that he misses
           his wife and child.

      The doctor adds a rider as follows:

            "It would be very helpful for his wife to  come  to  the  UK  to
        help with his care and physical well being and I  strongly  support
        the application for the family to be reunited."

 9. There is also a new witness statement from the  first  appellant.   She
    says that the sponsor has the mind of a child but the body  of  a  man.
    He needs looking after as he cannot do most  things  by  himself.   His
    mother looks after him and he lives with her in her house.  His  mother
    also looks after the  sponsor's  sister,  who  is  even  more  severely
    disabled.

10. The first appellant says that the marriage arose from a proposal by the
    sponsor's mother to her father, arising out of the family relationship.
     She was happy to marry the sponsor "as I liked him.  He  is  nice  and
    gentle and peaceful and a better husband than most.   I  would  have  a
    peaceful life with him and do not mind looking after him."  She  points
    out that the sponsor's mother will not be able to go on  looking  after
    the sponsor and his sister all their lives and so the sponsor's  mother
    wanted a wife for him.  The first appellant says that when her  husband
    is in Pakistan he stays with her.  She cooks and cleans and washes  for
    him.  She also has to bathe him and help him dress.  "He sleeps with me
    nearly every day when he is here.  It is very difficult for him and for
    his mother when I am not with him.  I do not think that  this  is  good
    for his health."

11. The first appellant says that her husband cannot talk much.  He listens
    a lot more and likes to listen to her.  He  sometimes  can  say  a  few
    words but mostly says her name and that of their  son.   "He  loves  us
    both very much".  When he is in the United Kingdom the first  appellant
    says that he phones her regularly about two  to  three  times  a  week.
    Mostly she talks and he just listens and says her name and  the  second
    appellant's name over and over again.  The first  appellant  says  that
    the sponsor "misses us very much".  She says that mostly  she  ends  up
    talking to his mother who then tries to tell the sponsor what  she  has
    said.

12. The first appellant confirms that she has never been to school or work.
     She cannot read or write.  She has essentially  no  earning  capacity,
    and could not go out to work as she would need to stay at home to  look
    after the sponsor and her son.  She says that  she  worries  about  the
    second appellant.  She would not be able  to  send  him  to  school  in
    Pakistan because schools in Pakistan have to be paid for and the school
    is a long way from her home.  She says that the appellants need  to  be
    with the sponsor as a family.

13. Paragraph 281 of the Immigration Rules requires for  present  purposes,
    at sub-para (i) that the first appellant and the sponsor  are  married;
    at sub-para (iii) that each of the parties intends to live  permanently
    with the other as his or her spouse and the marriage is subsisting; and
    at sub-para (iv) that the parties will be able to  maintain  themselves
    and any dependents adequately without recourse to public  funds".   For
    the second appellant the Rules are in para 301.  In  the  present  case
    the second appellant cannot meet the requirements of para  301  if  the
    first appellant is not granted entry clearance, but in any  event  sub-
    para 301(iva) requires it to be established that he could and would  be
    maintained adequately by his parents without recourse to public funds.

14. It is convenient to look at  the  requirements  under  the  Immigration
    Rules in reverse order.  We  therefore  begin  with  maintenance.   Not
    surprisingly in the light of  his  disabilities  the  sponsor  receives
    Disability Living Allowance as well as Income Support.  As a result the
    funds he receives may be more than would be paid to  a  couple  with  a
    dependant child who had to exist  on  income  support  alone.   And  we
    accept that as Disability Living Allowance is not means tested  it  may
    be that it is available for the maintenance of  other  members  of  the
    family.  In this  case  as  in  any  other,  however,  it  is  for  the
    appellants to establish that their maintenance will be adequate.  There
    is no suggestion that there will be income available to them other than
    that which is presently paid to and for the sponsor.  It is clear  that
    his needs are very great, and it is  not  suggested  that  anything  is
    being paid for at present which will not need to be  paid  for  if  the
    appellants are in the United Kingdom.  On the  basis  of  the  material
    available to the Entry Clearance Officer and to us it is impossible  to
    say that the amount of funds presently being paid to  the  sponsor  for
    himself would be  adequate  for  the  maintenance  of  him,  the  first
    appellant and their small child.   Indeed,  it  appears  to  us  highly
    likely that the reverse is the case.

15. Mr Mohammed  emphasised  to  us  that  he  did  not  concede  that  the
    appellants could not meet the maintenance requirements  of  the  Rules,
    but that he recognised that there were difficulties.  He was  right  to
    do  so.   Our  decision  is  that  the  appellants  have,  by  a   very
    considerable  margin,  failed  to  demonstrate  that  they   could   be
    maintained adequately without recourse to public funds.

16. The next question is whether, assuming  the  first  appellant  and  the
    sponsor to be married, each of them has (or rather, had at the date  of
    the decision) an intention  to  live  permanently  with  the  other  as
    husband and  wife.   We  have  already  set  out  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer's concerns, which we share.  There has been another visit since
    the date of the decision, but the position at the date of the  decision
    was that the first appellant knew very little about the sponsor despite
    the fact that they had by then been married for a considerable time and
    claimed to have been in frequent and lengthy contact on the  telephone.
    Even allowing for her own lack of education she also appeared  to  know
    very little about the sponsor's disability, whether from  him  or  from
    his mother.  Her  witness  statement  makes  it  clear  that  she  sees
    advantages in bringing her son to  the  United  Kingdom,  but  that  is
    rather different from a wish to be with the sponsor and,  moreover,  to
    be with him as his wife.  The requirements of sub-para  281  (iii)  are
    not met simply by a wish to share a house, nor by a wish to look  after
    the sponsor, or a wish to alleviate the care  responsibilities  imposed
    upon the sponsor's mother by her relatives.  Even  if  it  were  to  be
    accepted that the first appellant has an intention  to  live  with  the
    sponsor, we do not think that it can be said that the level of interest
    she has shown in him so far, and the reasons she gives for  wanting  to
    be with him really establish that she wants to be with him as his wife.



17. In addition, however, it needs to be established that the sponsor wants
    to live with the first appellant as her husband.  In many  cases  there
    is no particular need to inquire into the matter.   Here,  however,  we
    are told that the sponsor has severe physical and mental disability and
    learning disabilities.  He may or may not have a sexual  urge,  but  we
    know nothing of his approach to the status of being a husband.  Nor  is
    there any evidence  of  his  ability  to  form  an  intention  to  live
    permanently with anybody, whether  as  a  husband  or  not.   The  only
    evidence that is available simply raises a doubt about those issues.

18. For these reasons we cannot be satisfied  that,  at  the  date  of  the
    decision or subsequently, the appellant met the  requirements  of  para
    281(iii).

19. The final question relating to the Immigration  Rules  is  whether  the
    first appellant and the sponsor are in fact married; and if  they  are,
    whether the marriage is entitled to recognition in English  law.   That
    was the point which was raised by the  respondent's  representative  at
    the earlier hearing.  Reference was made to the recent decision of  the
    Court of Appeal KC and NNC v City of Westminster Social  and  Community
    Services Department [2008] EWCA Civ 198.  As we indicated in the course
    of argument, the facts of that case are not the facts  of  the  present
    appeal: there is no doubt that the subject of the Court's concern in KC
    was more severely disabled than the sponsor appears to be.  There  are,
    however, certain similarities; and it  cannot  be  suggested  that  the
    applicable law is anything other than that set  out  by  the  Court  of
    Appeal in KC.

20. The underlying question relates to the mental capacity of the  sponsor.
    The ceremony in May 2004 took place in Pakistan, according to  the  law
    of Pakistan, and there is no reason to suppose that  any  provision  of
    the lex loci celebrationis encroaches upon  its  validity.   The  first
    appellant must be domiciled in Pakistan, and there is in any  event  no
    doubt about her capacity.  The sponsor was born in Dewsbury and must be
    regarded as having, and retaining, a domicile of origin in England  and
    Wales.  His capacity to marry is governed by the law of  his  domicile:
    if there were any  doubt  about  that  proposition  as  regards  mental
    capacity, the decision of the Court of Appeal in KC to that  effect  is
    clearly binding on us.  The level of mental capacity required  was  set
    out after a review of the  authorities,  by  Singleton  LJ  (with  whom
    Birkett LJ and Hodson LJ agreed) in In the Estate of Park [1954] P 112.
     The party in question "must be mentally capable of  appreciating  that
    [the contract] involves  the  responsibilities  normally  attaching  to
    marriage" [at p 127].  That is not a high test of mental capacity,  but
    once the question is raised it is clearly for  the  appellant  to  deal
    with.  In the present case it is difficult to see how, on the evidence,
    anybody could be satisfied that the sponsor had or has  such  capacity.
    Lack of capacity does not render a purported  marriage  void,  however.
    By s 12(c) of the Matrimonial Causes  Act  1973,  lack  of  consent  by
    either party in consequence of unsoundness of mind renders  a  marriage
    voidable,  and  it  remains  valid  until  any  decree  of  nullity  is
    pronounced.  So lack  of  capacity  itself  would  not  mean  that  the
    ceremony of 9 April 2004 failed  to  have  the  effect  of  making  the
    sponsor and the first appellant husband and wife.

21. But at this point some of the considerations taken into account by  the
    Court of Appeal in KC do become relevant.  Given that the ceremony  was
    formally valid and that lack of capacity does not of itself  avoid  the
    marriage, is the marriage entitled to recognition in an English  Court?
    As that was the question answered by the Court of Appeal in KC, it must
    be taken to be the question asked by the respondent's representative in
    submitting KC for the attention of the Tribunal.  Although the  sponsor
    is not as severely disabled as was the subject of the court's attention
    in KC, there are similarities.  One of the  factors  which  appears  to
    have had most influence on the court in KC was that the husband was, by
    reason of mental incapacity, incapable of giving consent to any  sexual
    act.  It followed what would be otherwise ordinary congress between him
    and his wife would amount to a criminal offence.  The evidence  adduced
    on the appellant's behalf in this appeal, following the raising of  the
    question by the respondent,  is  very  far  from  indicating  that  the
    sponsor in this appeal is capable of  giving  the  necessary  level  of
    consent to sexual contact.  He may be or he may not: insofar as we have
    to decide the matter, we conclude that it has not been  established  in
    the appellant's favour.  We would therefore be inclined to hold, on the
    basis of that evidence, that the appellants have not  established  that
    the marriage between the sponsor and the  first  appellant  is,  albeit
    valid, entitled to recognition in this  country.   It  is  contrary  to
    public policy to recognise as valid a marriage which  is  voidable  for
    lack of mental capacity of one of the parties, and in which the  normal
    incidents of marriage would amount to  the  commission  of  a  criminal
    offence by one of them.

22. As we indicated, our decision does  not  depend  on  that  issue.   The
    appellants have not established either that the parties to the marriage
    at the date of the decision the intention to live together  permanently
    as husband and wife, or that adequate maintenance would  be  available.
    We have given our view on the marriage itself  because  the  issue  was
    canvassed before us.

23. We now turn to human rights arguments.  Mr Mohammed  told  us  that  he
    regarded the Article 8 arguments as now  being  the  primary  arguments
    upon which the appellants relied.  As we have said, the Entry Clearance
    Officer  dealt  with  them   briefly.    Before   us   the   respondent
    acknowledges, of course, the relationship between  the  appellants  and
    the sponsor.  It is argued on the respondent's behalf that the case  is
    exceptional.  Mr Mohammed's submissions were based largely on the needs
    of the sponsor's family in  the  United  Kingdom  rather  than  on  the
    appellants' rights to be with them.  He argued that no  useful  purpose
    was served by enforcing the Immigration Rules in this case: money would
    be saved if the sponsor and his sister were in due course looked  after
    by the appellants, rather than by state agencies.

24. The features of the relationship between the appellants and the sponsor
    have an impact on the proportionality of applying the Immigration Rules
    in the appellants' case.  The question is whether they have shown  that
    proportionality requires that they be admitted to  the  United  Kingdom
    despite their inability to  comply  with  the  Immigration  Rules.   In
    making that assessment it seems to us that there is very little on  the
    side favouring admission, and a great deal on the other side.  We  take
    into account everything of which we know, but it seems  to  us  that  a
    number of factors are particularly important.  First, as pointed out by
    the Entry Clearance Officer, the contact between the appellants and the
    sponsor has been minimal.  We are  not  confident  that  there  is  any
    record of contact between the sponsor and the second appellant  at  the
    date of the decision,  although  it  may  be  assumed  that  since  the
    decision the sponsor has met the second appellant.  So far  as  contact
    between the first appellant and the sponsor is concerned,  contact  has
    been minimal.  Evidently the sponsor can travel to  Pakistan  and  stay
    there, but he did not do so between his marriage visit and the date  of
    the decision.  The position at the date of the decision  was  also  was
    that the first appellant knew very little about  the  sponsor,  despite
    having been married to him for some years.  It was not  said  that  she
    had no contact with members of his family - quite  the  contrary.   Her
    lack of knowledge is  a  fact  counting  against  the  assertion  of  a
    Convention  right  to  be  with  him  on  the  basis  of  their  family
    relationship despite the provisions of the Immigration Rules.

25. We are entitled to take into account the submissions put by Mr Mohammed
    in relation to having a carer for the sponsor and  his  sister.   There
    can be no real doubt that the need for carers was a motive  behind  the
    arrangement of the wedding and for the present application,  made  some
    three years later, after an interval in which there had been  virtually
    no contact between the  parties  to  the  marriage.   Although  if  the
    appellants were admitted to the United Kingdom it  is  clear  that  the
    first appellant would look after the sponsor, her ability to do so  and
    the wish that she should do  so  does  not,  in  our  view,  assist  an
    argument based on Article 8.  This is a family in  which,  for  reasons
    which are in part understandable, the family relationships between  the
    appellants and the sponsor have been  exceptionally  distant.   Nothing
    had in any real sense been done to foster them in the period before the
    present decision was made; and we have found that the  first  appellant
    has not established that she and the sponsor intend  to  live  together
    permanently as husband and wife.  In the circumstances the position  is
    that the appellants have not established that the interlocking  Article
    8 rights of all the members of the family  entitle  them  to  admission
    despite their inability to comply with the Immigration Rules.

26. There is one other point.  It is said that the second  appellant  is  a
    British citizen.   Whether  that  is  right  probably  depends  on  the
    validity of his parents'  marriage  and  the  question  whether  it  is
    entitled to recognition.  In any event, if he is a British citizen,  he
    does not need the entry clearance for which he applied.  So far  as  we
    understand the matter, if he is a British citizen he is at  liberty  to
    be in the United Kingdom or to remain with his mother in Pakistan.  The
    mere fact that he has that liberty does not entitle his mother to be in
    the United Kingdom, and there is no suggestion that  at  the  date  the
    decision it was anticipated that he would come to  the  United  Kingdom
    without her, or that she had a right to  come  to  the  United  Kingdom
    despite her inability to support him, merely by  his  being  a  British
    citizen.  If such arguments are to be made, it seems to  us  that  they
    should be made to the Entry Clearance Officer, by way of an application
    by the first appellant clearly  indicating  that  the  purpose  of  the
    application is to enable her to accompany her infant son  exercising  a
    right of residence in the United Kingdom.

27.  The  appellants  are  not  entitled  to  admission  either  under  the
    Immigration Rules or under Article 8.  Their appeals are dismissed.
