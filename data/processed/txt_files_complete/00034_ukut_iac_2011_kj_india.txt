For the Respondent:          Mr. R. Hopkin, Home Office Presenting Officer


The Secretary of State accepts that, following the judgment of  the  Supreme
Court in Mahad v. Entry Clearance Officer [2009]  UKSC  16,  applicants  for
entry clearance as working holiday makers under the  now  defunct  paragraph
95 of the Immigration Rules, may rely upon third party support in  order  to
show that they satisfy the requirements of paragraph 95(v),  which  requires
that: "(v) [the applicant] is able and intends to maintain  and  accommodate
himself without recourse to public funds; ..."  However, it  will  still  be
necessary for Immigration Judges to determine whether,  on  the  facts,  any
third party support relied upon will  in  fact  be  available  and,  if  so,
whether  on  the  whole  of  the  evidence,  the  applicant  satisfies   the
requirement in paragraph 95(v).








                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.    The Appellant, who is a national of  India  born  on  28  April  1986,
     applied on 20 November 2008 for entry clearance as  a  working  holiday
     maker. His application was refused by the Respondent on 17 March 2009.

2.    The Respondent was not satisfied that the  following  requirements  of
     paragraph 95 of the Statement of Changes in the  Immigration  Rules  HC
     395 (as amended) ("the Immigration Rules") were satisfied:

      (a)   (para 95(v))  that  the  Appellant  was  able  and  intended  to
           maintain and accommodate  himself  without  recourse  to  public
           funds;

       (b)    (para  95(vi))  that  the  Appellant  intended  only  to  take
           employment which was incidental to a holiday; and

      (c)   (para 95 (viii)) that the Appellant intended to leave the UK  at
           the end of his working holiday.

3.     The  Respondent  reached  these  conclusions  for  several   reasons,
     including that the Appellant planned to take with him Rs. 5  lakh,  the
     equivalent of �6250, which the Respondent considered was a large amount
     compared to his family's circumstances. The Respondent noted  that  the
     Appellant's father earned Rs. 8279, the equivalent  of  about  �103,  a
     month. The Respondent did not consider it credible that  the  Appellant
     intended to spend his father's income for five years  and  deplete  the
     whole of his retirement  fund  and  savings  to  pay  for  an  extended
     holiday.  The  Respondent  did  not  consider  that  these  funds  were
     genuinely available to the Appellant. The  Respondent  considered  that
     the Appellant had not shown how his parents would support themselves in
     retirement, if their retirement funds were used to pay for his extended
     holiday.

4.     The  Appellant's  appeal  against  the  Respondent's   decision   was
     determined on the documentary evidence by Immigration Judge Peart. This
     was because the Appellant  did  not  request  an  oral  hearing.  In  a
     determination promulgated on 12 October  2009,  the  Immigration  Judge
     dismissed the Appellant's appeal. The Immigration Judge referred to  TS
     (working holiday maker: no third  party  support)  India  [2008]  UKAIT
     00024, KS (India) and JA (Bangladesh) [2009]  EWCA  Civ  762.  He  then
     said, at paragraphs 8 and 9 as follows:

      "8.   The Appellant clear [sic] in his application at 6.2.5  that  his
           father and himself through part-time employment  would  pay  for
           his travel to and around the United Kingdom and  at  6.2.6,  the
           Appellant said his father would pay his initial expenses such as
           accommodation and food. The Appellant  said  at  6.2.7  that  Rs
           5,00,000 would be available to him for  the  trip.  I  find  the
           Appellant  is  dependent  on  third  party   support.   In   the
           circumstances, I find the Appellant does not satisfy TS, KS  and
           JA such that the appeal must be dismissed for  that  reason.  In
           any event, I do not accept that the Appellant's family's  socio-
           economic  circumstances  in  India  are  consistent   with   the
           Appellant spending his father's retirement fund in order to  pay
           for the working holiday.

      9.    Looking at  the  evidence  in  the  round,  I  find  it  is  the
           Appellant's intention to come to the United Kingdom by  whatever
           means and to remain here. For the reasons  set  out,  I  do  not
           accept the Appellant is a  genuine  working  holiday  maker  who
           intends returning to his own country."

5.    In his grounds of application for permission to appeal, the  Appellant
     contended (inter alia) that his father is not a third person  and  that
     the support of a family member does not amount to third party  support.
     He said that, by Indian tradition, members of  a  family  support  each
     other. His father is employed at a sugar mill, having returned from the
     army. His father's earnings from the sugar mill are an extra source  of
     income. Every source of income is available for  the  assistance  of  a
     family member.

6.    On 8 July 2010, Senior Immigration Judge  Nichols  granted  permission
     to appeal. She considered it arguable that the  Immigration  Judge  had
     erred on a point of law in finding that the Appellant could not rely on
     his father for financial support in  order  to  undertake  his  working
     holiday in the United Kingdom. She considered that  the  Supreme  Court
     had arguably decided otherwise  in  Mahad  v  Entry  Clearance  Officer
     [2009] UKSC 16.

7.    At the hearing on 8 December 2010, there was no appearance  on  behalf
     of the Appellant. This was not surprising since the Appellant  did  not
     have a representative in the United Kingdom or a UK-based sponsor.  The
     Appellant was given notice of the hearing  by  way  of  the  Notice  of
     Hearing dated 9 November 2010. We were satisfied  that  the  Notice  of
     Hearing was properly served, as it was sent to  the  Appellant's  last-
     notified address. There was nothing to suggest that, if the hearing was
     adjourned, there would be representation on the Appellant's  behalf  on
     the next occasion. In the circumstances and having regard  to  rule  38
     and the overriding objection in rule 2 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper
     Tribunal) Rules 2008 (the Procedure Rules), we were satisfied  that  it
     was in the interests of justice to proceed  with  the  hearing  and  we
     exercised our discretion to proceed with the hearing.

8.    Mr. Hopkin addressed us briefly. He appeared  to  have  some  sympathy
     for the argument that, following the judgment of the Supreme  Court  in
     Mahad, third party support may not fall foul  of  the  requirements  of
     paragraph 95. We did not hear full argument. We asked if the  Secretary
     of State was prepared to concede that, following the  judgment  of  the
     Supreme Court in Mahad, third party support was  available  to  working
     holiday  makers.   Mr.  Hopkin  informed  us   that   he   would   take
     instructions, for which purpose we allowed Mr. Hopkin a period of seven
     days.

9.    On 15 December 2010,  the  Upper  Tribunal  received  by  facsimile  a
     letter of the same date from Mr. Hopkin. Paragraphs 3  and  4  of  this
     letter read:

      "3.   I have had the opportunity to  now  take  instructions  and  can
           confirm the position of the Secretary of  State  in  respect  of
           applications for entry clearance under the now defunct provision
           of Immigration Rule 95 and the use by those applicants of "third
           party support", which is discussed in  the  authority  Mahad  v.
           Entry Clearance Officer [2009] UKSC 16.

      4.    It is accepted by the Secretary of State  that  such  applicants
           are entitled to rely upon the financial support of third parties
           in establishing they discharge the burden of  proof  in  meeting
           Immigration Rule 95(v), which requires:

      (v)   [the applicant] is able and intends to maintain and  accommodate
                 himself without recourse to public funds; ..."

      Immigration Judges will be aware, of  course,  that  they  will  still
     need to determine whether, on the facts, any third party support relied
     upon will in fact be available and, if so, whether on the whole of  the
     evidence, the applicant satisfies the requirement in paragraph 95(v).

10.   On the basis of the letter from Mr. Hopkin, we are satisfied that  the
     Immigration Judge misdirected himself in law by relying upon TS (India)
     and KS  (India).  However,  the  question  is  whether  the  error  was
     material.

11.   In his letter, Mr. Hopkin  confirmed  his  position  at  the  hearing,
     that, on the facts of this case, the  Appellant  did  not  satisfy  the
     requirements of paragraph 95(v). At the hearing, Mr.  Hopkin  submitted
     that the question of third party support was immaterial to the outcome,
     given the Immigration Judge's finding that the retirement fund  of  the
     Appellant's  father  was  not  genuinely  available  to  pay  for   the
     Appellant's working holiday. Mr. Hopkin referred us to the  Appellant's
     answer to question 6.2.7 of his application, where he said that he  had
     available Rs. 5,00,000. There was  a  certificate  from  the  Jalandhar
     Central Co-Op Bank Limited dated 12 November 2009 in the names  of  the
     Appellant's parents, which shows that the balance in their  account  at
     the close of business that day was about Rs. 1,89,  434.  There  was  a
     certificate from the Employees' Provident  Fund  Organisation  dated  1
     April 2009 which stated that the closing balance in the  fund  held  in
     the name of the Appellant's father as at 31 March 2008 was Rs 3,05,607.
     A letter dated 6 April 2009 from the Nakodar Co-op. Sugar Mills Limited
     confirmed that the Appellant's father earned a monthly  net  salary  of
     Rs. 10,064.

12.   We reserved our decision.

13.   Although the Respondent has  conceded  that  third  party  support  is
     available to  a  working  holiday  maker  under  paragraph  95  of  the
     Immigration Rules, this issue is not material to the  outcome  in  this
     particular appeal, for reasons which we will now give.

14.   The Immigration Judge's alternative finding in the final  sentence  of
     paragraph 8 of the determination is determinative of the appeal. In the
     Refusal Notice, the Respondent said that it was not considered credible
     that the Appellant would deplete the whole of his  father's  retirement
     fund and savings in order to pay for his working holiday. In answer  to
     question 6.2.5 of the application form, the Appellant  stated  that  he
     intended to take  with  him  Rs.  5,00,000.  This  sum  represents  the
     aggregate of the amount of Rs. 3,05,607, representing the entire  value
     of his father's retirement fund as at 31 March 2008 (as stated  in  the
     certificate dated 1 April  2009  from  the  Employees'  Provident  Fund
     Organisation), and the amount of Rs. 1,89,434, representing the  entire
     amount of his parents' savings as at 12 November 2009 (as stated in the
     certificate from Jalandhar Central Co-Op Bank Limited). In other words,
     the Respondent was correct  to  say  that  the  Appellant  intended  to
     deplete his father's retirement fund and savings on a working  holiday,
     leaving his parents with only a net monthly income of Rs.  10,064  (the
     equivalent of �103) from his father's  employment  with  Nakodar  Co-op
     Sugar Mills Limited. This was strong evidence  before  the  Immigration
     Judge that the funds in question were not genuinely available.

15.   The Appellant's explanation in his grounds of appeal was to  say  that
     the funds were available to him and that family  members  support  each
     other. We were of the view that this explanation did not satisfactorily
     address  the  issue  raised  by  the  Respondent.  In  particular,  the
     Appellant has not explained how his parents would support themselves in
     retirement if their retirement funds were used to pay for his  extended
     holiday. This was a point specifically mentioned in the Refusal Notice.
     In our judgment, the Immigration Judge was fully entitled to  find,  on
     the evidence before  him,  that  the  financial  circumstances  of  the
     Appellant's family were not consistent with  the  Appellant  using  his
     father's retirement fund and savings in order to pay  for  his  working
     holiday, that is, that the funds were not genuinely available.

  16. Accordingly, the Immigration Judge's  misdirection  on  the  issue  of
      third party support did not affect his decision to dismiss the appeal.




Decision


17.    The decision of the Immigration Judge did not involve the  making  of
     an error on a point of law such that it falls to  be  set  aside.   The
     Immigration Judge's decision therefore stands.
