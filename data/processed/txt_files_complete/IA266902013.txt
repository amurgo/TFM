Representation:

For the Appellant:      Mr G Jack, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:     Mr D Adophy of Rana & Co Solicitors

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The claimant is a Pakistani citizen,  born  on  5  February  1988.   He
    appeals against the decision of the Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
    Department dated 11 June 2013 refusing to vary his leave to  remain  in
    the United Kingdom and issuing directions for his removal under Section
    47 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

2.   Essentially it was for the claimant to show that for the  requisite  28
    day period he was in possession of at least �2,100 so as to satisfy the
    maintenance requirements as required by paragraph 1A of Appendix  C  of
    the Immigration Rules.

3.   Paragraph 1A(h) of Appendix  C  of  the  Immigration  Rules  states  as
    follows:-

         "The end date of the 90 day and 28 day periods  ... will  be  taken
         as the date of the closing  balance  of  the  most  recent  of  the
         specified documents, and must be no earlier than 31 days before the
         date of application."

4.   In support of his application the  claimant  submitted  two  documents.
    The first was a bank statement dated 19 April 2013 from Lloyds TSB  and
    the second was a letter from Lloyds TSB dated 22 May 2013 showing  that
    the level of funds on that particular day was �2,093.41.

5.   The relevant passage of the refusal letter reads as follows:-

         "As the closing date of the bank statement submitted in support  of
         your application dated 19 April 2013, you need to show evidence  of
         �2,100 maintenance for 28 days from 23 March 2013 to 19 April 2013.




         However, between  23  March  2013  and  26  March  2013  your  bank
         statements state you were in possession of no more than �700.09.


         It has been noted you have also submitted a letter from Lloyds  TSB
         dated 2 May 2013 as the letter submitted only shows  the  level  of
         funds available to  you on  2 May 2013, and the level of  funds  on
         that day are �2,093.41 you have not demonstrated that you have  the
         level of funds required over the specified  28  day  period  to  be
         granted as Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant.


         It  has  therefore  been  decided  that  you  have  not   met   the
         requirements as specified within the Immigration Rules and 0 points
         have been awarded for Maintenance (Funds)."

6.   Thus the matter came for hearing before First-tier Tribunal Judge  Adio
    on 2 January 2014.  At that hearing the claimant  ought  to  produce  a
    Silver Advantage Bank account statement from Lloyds  TSB  covering  the
    period of 20 April 2013 to 24 May 2013.

7.   It was argued that that bank statement  met  the  requirements  of  the
    Rules and that it was dated prior to the date of application.

8.   It showed that the claimant had �2,100 available between 26  March  and
    1 May.  The claimant was a genuine student and had paid a lot of  money
    towards his studies.

9.   It was argued before the Judge by the Home  Office  Presenting  Officer
    that that new statement was not admissible by virtue of Section  19  of
    the UK Borders  Act  2007.   The  Judge  could  only  take  account  of
    documents submitted as the date of the application.

10.  The Judge says nothing in  the  determination  about  that  matter  and
    finds that on the basis of the  new  evidence  as  submitted  that  the
    claimant had met the requirements of the Immigration Rules, having  the
    requisite amount for the 28 period.  The Judge found that the Secretary
    of State for the Home Department had not considered the claimant's case
    in its totality and the appeal was allowed.

11.  The Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department,  however,  seeks  to
    appeal against that decision on  the  basis  that  the  Judge  was  not
    permitted under the statute to take account  of  that  particular  bank
    statement.  Indeed the Judge does  not  specifically  engage  with  the
    submissions made relating to Section 19  nor  with  the  provisions  of
    Section 85A of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  which
    places significant restrictions on the post-application  evidence  that
    can be adduced.

12.  Permission to appeal was granted on that basis.

13.  Thus the matter comes before me in pursuance of that grant.

14.   Mr  Adophy,  who  represents  the  appellant,  made  essentially   two
    submissions to me.  The first was  that  the  documentation  which  was
    originally submitted was sufficient in itself to  satisfy  the  28  day
    rule, in the alternative that because there was a letter from the  bank
    dated 2 May 2013 the new bank statement was merely evidence  clarifying
    that situation and is not to be regarded as new evidence  falling  foul
    of the provisions of Section 19.

15.  In support of his first  contention  my  attention  was  drawn  to  the
    documents which can be found at appendices E and F of the  respondent's
    bundle of documents. The first is a bank statement issued on  19  April
    2013 showing activity from 20 March to 9 April 2013.  It is stamped  by
    the bank with a stamp dated 2 May 2013. The second document is a letter
    addressed to the claimant from the bank dated  2  May  2013  specifying
    that as at 2 May 2013 the balance stood at  �2,093.41.   That  is  also
    stamped by the bank on 2 May 2013.

16.  Mr Adophy said that the difficulty facing the claimant  in  making  his
    application was that the bank only issues statements on a monthly basis
    and the best therefore that he was able to get from the  bank  in  time
    for the application was the letter of 2 May stamped by the bank to show
    that there had been no change in the claimant's bank details as from  9
    April 2013.

17.  The difficulty with  that  contention  is  that  the  letter  does  not
    specify that fact and could  easily have done so but in any event  from
    9 April 2013 is the sum of �2,103.02 but on 2 May  2013  is  �2,093.41.
    Therefore somewhere  over  that  period  the  balance  fell  below  the
    requisite �2,100.

18.  The letter of 2 May was considered by the Secretary of  State  for  the
    Home Department and for the reasons which are set out  in  the  refusal
    letter did not assist the cause of the claimant.

19.  The claimant made his claim on 25 May and now  produces  the  statement
    dated 24 May.  I do not understand without more why the more up-to-date
    bank statement could not  have  been  submitted  at  the  time  of  the
    application.  The event which caused the bank account to fall below the
    requisite figure in any event was the  �9.61 which  was  debited  as  a
    service charge for the account.

20.  It is a relevant consideration in considering this  matter  to  note  a
    previous communication with the appellant by the Secretary of State for
    the Home Department on 4 May 2013.  The appellant had  originally  made
    his application for leave as a Tier 4 (General) Student on 25 May  2013
    having submitted a  Confirmation  of  Acceptance  for  Studies  at  the
    Shepherd  Business  School  Limited.   Prior  to   having   made   that
    application there had been a decision to  revoke  the  licence  of  the
    business school.  Accordingly the claimant was notified in  the  letter
    of 4 March 2013 that he would be allowed 60 calendar days in  order  to
    submit a fresh application. Thus significantly in that document was the
    following:-

         "If you obtain a new CAS then you will need to submit fresh and up-
         to-date documents with your application to vary, for  example  bank
         statements showing you are in possession  of  sufficient  funds  to
         cover your course fees and the maintenance requirement."

     Thus the claimant was clearly under notice to submit  the  most  recent
    documents in support of the renewal of his application.

21.  The second submission made by Mr Adophy is to the effect  that  because
    there was the evidence presented at  the  time  of  application  of  an
    account running to 2 May 2013,  it was  permissible  to  introduce  the
    bank statement in  clarification  of  that  matter.   It  was  not  new
    evidence but merely evidence in support of that which was presented.

22.  Mr Jack points out that when the original application was  made  on  25
    May 2013 the new CAS and new bank statements seeking the  variation  in
    pursuance of the March letter from the Secretary of State for the  Home
    Department were received on 7 May 2013.  Thus it would have  been  open
    to the claimant to have  submitted  a  bank  statement  prior  to  that
    period.  Having gone to the trouble of obtaining the  letter  from  the
    bank, a few additional sentences from bank  as  to  the  state  of  the
    account between 19 April and 2  May  would  have  resolved  the  issue.
    Nevertheless that was not done and the documents were not  eloquent  of
    what is now said that they represent.  He submits  that  the  new  bank
    statement is fresh evidence and as such still caught by  the  Rules  by
    Section 19 and paragraph 85A.
23.  He submits that however technical it may appear, the Rules have  to  be
    obeyed.

24.  It seems to me that that is an argument which has merit.   It  was  the
    decision of the legislature, in enacting the various provisions  relied
    upon, that no new evidence would be  admitted  after  the  application.
    Clearly the new bank statement is fresh evidence as it seeks to clarify
    rather than repeat that which is set out in  the  application.  I  find
    therefore that the Judge  in  failing  to  take  consideration  of  the
    statutory framework has erred  in  law.   I  therefore  set  aside  the
    decision and proceed to remake it.

25.  Mr Adophy submits that to refuse to grant  the  leave  sought  for  the
    sake of �9.61 is both unfair and draconian. He invites me to find  that
    at the very least  it  breaches  claimant's  human  rights  and  it  is
    disproportionate to remove him from the jurisdiction.

26.  It is in that  context  that  the  decision  of  Patel  and  Others  as
    promulgated by the Supreme Court [2013] UKSC  72  is  of  significance.
    That judgment considered the cases of Patel, Anwar and Alam.

27.  In relation to the cases of Alam and  Anwar  similar  issues  arose  in
    their appeals, namely the practical problem  faced  by  the  appellants
    arising from their failure to produce  relevant  evidence  as  required
    under the points-based system at the relevant time.  Each appellant was
    able to produce the relevant evidence in response to  the  Section  120
    notice, however, but was barred by exception  2  of  Section  85A  from
    relying on it directly in support of the appeal.  The issue before  the
    Supreme Court was whether an indirect route could  be found to  achieve
    a favourable result.  That indirect route being to rely upon the  human
    rights grounds as set out in Article 8 of the ECHR.

28.  Of particular importance to the present  case  are  the  terms  of  the
    judgment as set out in paragraphs 56 and  57  of  that  decision.   The
    court recognised that a  formalised  "near  miss"  or  "sliding  scale"
    principle is unsupported by  Strasbourg  authority  or  by  the  proper
    reading of Lord Bingham's words in the case  of  Huang.   A  near  miss
    under the Rules cannot provide substance to a human rights  case  which
    is otherwise lacking in merit.

29.  The court went on to stress that Article 8 is not a general  dispensing
    power.  It is  to  be  distinguished  from  the  Secretary  of  State's
    discretion to allow leave to remain outside  the  Rules  which  may  be
    unrelated  to  any  projected  human  rights.  The  opportunity  for  a
    promising student to complete his  course  in  this  country,   however
    desirable in general terms, is not in itself a  right  protected  under
    Article 8 of the ECHR.

30.  The comments made by the Supreme Court were  considered  by  the  Upper
    Tribunal in Nasim and Others (Article 8) [2014] UKUT 0025 (IAC)  .  The
    Tribunal indicated at paragraph 12 of the judgment that the  particular
    passages as set out in paragraph 57 of Patel and  Others  had  a  wider
    import in seeking to  refocus  attention  upon  the  core  purposes  of
    Article 8.   It  regarded  the  decision  in  Patel  and  Others  as  a
    significant exhortation from the Supreme Court to refocus attention  on
    the nature and purpose of Article 8 and in particular to recognise  its
    limited utility  to  an  individual  where  one  has  moved  along  the
    continuum from that Article's core  area  of  operation  towards  which
    might be described as its "fuzzy penumbra".   The Tribunal  found  that
    the nature and right asserted by each of the appellants, based on their
    desire as former students to undertake a period of post-study  work  in
    the United Kingdom, lay at the outer  reaches  of  cases  requiring  an
    affirmative answer to the second of the five "Razgar" questions.

31.  The Tribunal also looked at the scope of CDS  (Brazil)  and  paragraphs
    39 to 42.

32.  In this particular case before me the appellant has no family  life  or
    other wider Article 8 issues other than his wish to remain as a student
    and to capitalise upon and  to  see  to  fruition  that  which  he  has
    expended so much time, energy and fees upon. As such he is not somebody
    who can cite near miss in the context and understanding  of  the  Upper
    Tribunal in Nasim.  In that connection he  is  not  dissimilar  from  a
    number of the appellants who appeared before the Tribunal.

33.  For the sake of completeness my attention is also drawn to  a  decision
    of the Upper Tribunal in Shazhad (Article 8 -  legitimate  aim)  [2014]
    UKUT 0085 (IAC).

34   That held particularly where an area of the rules does  not  have  such
    an express mechanism, the approach in R (Nagre) v  Secretary  of  State
    for the Home Department [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin) (29-31  in  particular)
    and Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT  640
    (IAC) should be followed i.e. after applying the  requirements  of  the
    Rules, only if there may be arguably good grounds for granting leave to
    remain outside them is it necessary for Article 8 purposes to go on  to
    consider whether there are compelling  circumstances  not  sufficiently
    recognised under them.

35.  It seems to me having regard to the case as a whole  that  the  context
    is relatively straightforward.  In  the  decision  of  March  2013  the
    appellant and his representatives were alerted  to  the  need  to  have
    updated documents in support of the variation of leave  to  be  sought.
    Those documents when presented were insufficient for the  purposes  for
    which they were presented.  It is unfortunate  because  with  a  little
    more care and attention  the  correct  documentation  could  have  been
    presented.  The error lies with the claimant  and  his  representatives
    and not with the respondent. Unfortunately thereafter the claimant  was
    caught by the  somewhat  draconian  Rules  against  the  submission  of
    further evidence. The fact that he narrowly missed the requirements  of
    the Rules and could in any event have satisfied them  had  the  correct
    documentation been submitted affords him little relief under the  "near
    miss principle".

36.  Of course these  matters  do  not  prevent  the  sensible  exercise  of
    discretion by the Secretary of State for the Home Department  in  these
    situations.  Although the  points-based  system  seeks  to  remove  the
    exercise of discretion in the interests of certainty and clarity, there
    must  be  those  situations  such  as  this  which  could  possibly  be
    recognised in the reality of the situation that the claimant was a bona
    fide student who in fact  satisfied  the  Rules  at  the  time  of  the
    application  and  decision  but  for  the  statutory  limitations  upon
    evidence being presented could  have  established  his  case.   In  the
    scheme of matters  where  the  sums  available  to  the  claimant  were
    deficient by �9.61 for three days is a matter of concern that  so  much
    time and money and effort have been expended on this matter.

37.  It is not for me  to  inform  the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department of her responsibilities or indeed to invite her  to  act  in
    any way other than that  which  she  considers  to  be  proper  in  the
    circumstances.  However in this particular case I would  hope  that  an
    element of compassion and commonsense can enter into what is  otherwise
    a legal and technical web of argument such as to permit the claimant to
    complete his studies in the United Kingdom, particularly as they are to
    be completed within a few  months.  In  the  alternative  the  claimant
    having  3C  leave  may  be  permitted  to  make  a  fresh  in   country
    application, supplying the correct documentation.

38.  Nevertheless as to the legal aspect of the appeal and  the  application
    of Section 19 and paragraph 85A it falls for me to uphold the appeal of
    the Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  and  accordingly  to
    dismiss that of the claimant.  For the reasons advanced it is  also  it
    is also not established in the light of the current  jurisprudence  and
    that the claimant would succeed in relation to Article 8 of the ECHR.

39.  Thus the Secretary of State's appeal is allowed.  The decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge  is  set  aside  and  remade  such  that  the
    claimant's appeals both in respect of  the  Immigration  Rules  and  of
    human rights are dismissed.
