Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr M Moriarty of Counsel, instructed by Everest Law
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This has been a remote hearing which has not been objected  to  by  the
    parties.  The form of remote hearing was  by  video,  using  Skype  and
    there were no technical, audio or visual issues during the hearing.   A
    face to face hearing was not  held  to  take  precautions  against  the
    spread of Covid-19 and as all issues  could  be  determined  by  remote
    means.  The documents were available in paper format on the court file.

 2. The Appellant appeals with permission against the  decision  of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Abebrese promulgated on 25 February 2020, in  which
    the Appellant's appeal against the decision to refuse her human  rights
    claim for entry to the United Kingdom as the adult dependent child of a
    Ghurka settled here, dated 22 March 2019, was dismissed.

 3. The Appellant is a national of Nepal, born on 18 August 1977, who  made
    an application for entry clearance to the United Kingdom on 10  January
    2019 to join her parents who had both been granted indefinite leave  to
    enter the United Kingdom and arrived here on 26  November  2010,  where
    they have been residing ever since.

 4. The Respondent refused the application the basis that the Appellant did
    not meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules for a grant of entry
    clearance, nor did she  meet  the  requirements  of  the  discretionary
    policy for entry clearance for  dependent  children  of  Gurkhas.   The
    Appellant was 41 years old at the date  of  application,  was  in  good
    health,  educated,  able  to  care  for  herself  and  able  to  obtain
    employment.  The Appellant had siblings in Nepal who  had  not  applied
    for entry clearance.  Overall, the Respondent was  not  satisfied  that
    the Appellant was fully financially and/or emotionally dependent on her
    parents in the  United  Kingdom.   Whilst  the  historic  injustice  in
    relation to Gurkhas had been considered, it was not  accepted  that  it
    outweighed the public interest and overall Article 8  of  the  European
    Convention on Human Rights was not engaged.  An Entry Clearance Manager
    reviewed the decision and maintained it on 5 November 2019.

 5. Judge Abebrese dismissed the appeal in a  decision  promulgated  on  25
    February 2020 on all grounds.

The appeal

 6. The Appellant appeals on two grounds as follows.  First, that the First-
    tier Tribunal has materially erred in law in relation to its assessment
    of the historic injustice in cases such as these, by  stating  that  it
    was not clear why the Appellant had not  applied  for  entry  clearance
    earlier, when this was because the policy did not  permit  applications
    from adult children absent special circumstances prior  to  2015.   The
    First-tier Tribunal's findings on whether Article 8 is engaged  or  not
    is wholly unclear and there are no clear findings as to  whether  there
    is real, or effective, or committed support for the purposes of  family
    life in accordance with the test  in  Rai  v  Entry  Clearance  Officer
    [2017] EWCA Civ 320.  Secondly, that there are both factual  and  legal
    errors in the First-tier Tribunal's proportionality balancing exercise,
    in particular the Appellant does not have any siblings  in  Nepal,  her
    sister is in Canada and her brother died in 2009.  In any event whether
    or not there were siblings in Nepal was not relevant to the question of
    whether the Appellant had family life with  her  parents,  nor  was  it
    relevant as to whether it was the Appellant's parents' choice to  leave
    Nepal and come to the United Kingdom, nor was it relevant whether there
    were employment opportunities available to the Appellant in Nepal.

 7. At the hearing, on behalf of the Respondent,  Mr  Whitwell  conceded  a
    material error of law in the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal,  who
    had made a decision which was confused  and  did  not  make  any  clear
    findings on the engagement of Article 8 of the European  Convention  on
    Human Rights or on the proportionality of the refusal.

Findings and reasons - error of law

 1. The Respondent's acceptance of  an  error  of  law  in  this  case  was
    entirely appropriate and I indicated during the hearing that I  was  in
    agreement with it, that there was a material error of law such that the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal must be set aside.

 2. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is relatively brief,  fails  to
    set out the legal framework or make any appropriate  self-direction  as
    to the test to be applied as to whether first, Article 8(1) family life
    is engaged and secondly, as to  the  relevant  considerations  for  the
    proportionality balancing exercise and the importance of  the  historic
    injustice to Gurkha  families,  which  is,  absent  particular  adverse
    circumstances, usually sufficient to outweigh the  public  interest  in
    maintenance of immigration control.

 3. The findings of the First-tier Tribunal are contained in paragraphs  15
    to 17 of the decision, but  without  any  clear  conclusions,  or  even
    consideration of relevant matters.  Paragraph 15 of the decision is  so
    poorly drafted to the extent that it simply doesn't make any  sense  at
    all.  It cannot clearly be read, alone or in conjunction with the  rest
    of the decision as containing any actual findings as to whether Article
    8(1) is engaged or not, or even if relevant factors had been considered
    as part of this or not.

 4. Paragraph 16  of  the  decision  appears  to  find  that  the  historic
    injustice is outweighed for the reasons provided by the  Respondent  in
    the refusal decision because the Appellant's parents chose to leave the
    Appellant in Nepal, alongside other siblings who remain there  and  the
    Judge was not satisfied that any income in Nepal would be  insufficient
    such that the Appellant had  to  rely  solely  on  the  income  of  her
    parents.  Those  findings  do  not  directly  relate  to  the  historic
    injustice at all, nor do they provide any sufficient basis for reaching
    a conclusion opposite to that which  would  normally  be  expected  (if
    Article 8(1) was engaged at all), absent particular circumstances, such
    as criminality.  It also includes a factual error about the Appellant's
    siblings, about whom there was unchallenged evidence that one no longer
    resided in Nepal and one  was  deceased.   These  factual  errors  were
    repeated again in paragraph 17,  which  is  also  muddled  between  the
    concepts of family life, family life the purposes of  engaging  Article
    8(1) and a wholly irrelevant consideration of whether the Appellant has
    been prevented from leading a normal life.

 5. Overall, the First-tier Tribunal's decision contains material errors of
    law and has in essence failed entirely to discharge the  task  that  it
    was faced with to make clear findings to determine  this  appeal.   The
    decision is muddled, confused, in places makes  no  sense  and  in  any
    event makes no clear findings with reference to the relevant test to be
    applied.  For these reasons, the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    must be set aside and in the light of the errors within it,  there  are
    no findings of fact which can be preserved.

 6. At the end of the hearing, the parties agreed that no further  evidence
    was required to remake the decision, which would be made on  the  basis
    of written submissions from  both  parties,  following  which  I  would
    remake the decision on appeal on the papers, issuing one  comprehensive
    decision  covering  both  the  error  of  law  and   remake   elements.
    Directions were given to the parties to make written submissions, which
    were duly complied with.

Re-making the appeal

Relevant law

 7. The legal position for cases such  as  these  has  most  recently  been
    summarised by the Court of Appeal in Rai from paragraphs 17 onwards, as
    follows:

         "17. In Kugathas v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
         [2003] EWCA Civ  31,  Sedley  LJ  said  (in  paragraph  17  of  his
         judgement) that "if dependency is read down as  meaning  "support",
         in the personal sense, and if  one  adds,  echoing  the  Strasbourg
         jurisprudence, "real" or "committed" or  "effective"  to  the  word
         "support", then it represents... the irreducible  minimum  of  what
         family life implies".  Arden  LJ  said  (in  paragraph  24  of  her
         judgement) that the "relevant factors...  include  identifying  who
         are the relatives of the appellant, the nature of the links between
         them and the appellant, the age of the appellant,  where  and  with
         whom he has resided in the past, and the forms of  contact  he  has
         maintained with the other members of the family with whom he claims
         to have a family life".  She acknowledged (at  paragraph  25)  that
         "there is no presumption of family life".  Thus "a family  life  is
         not established between an adult child and his surviving parent  or
         other siblings unless something more exists than  normal  emotional
         ties".  She added that "[such] ties might exist  if  the  appellant
         were dependent on his family or vice versa", but it  was  "not  ...
         essential that the members of the family  should  be  in  the  same
         country".  In Patel and others v Entry  Clearance  Officer,  Mumbai
         [2010] EWCA Civ  17,  Sedley  LJ  said  (in  paragraph  14  of  his
         judgement, with which Longmore and Aikens LJJ. agreed)  that  "what
         may constitute an extant family  life  falls  well  short  of  what
         constitutes dependency, and a good many adult children... may still
         have a family life with parents who are now  settled  here  not  by
         leave or by force of circumstances but by long-delayed right".

         18. In Ghising (family life - adults -  Gurkha  policy)  the  Upper
         Tribunal accepted (in paragraph 56 of its determination)  that  the
         judgements in Kugathas had been "interpreted  to  restrictively  in
         the past in order to be read in light of  subsequent  decisions  of
         the domestic and Strasbourg courts", and  (in  paragraph  60)  that
         "some of the [Strasbourg] Courts  decisions  indicate  that  family
         life between adult children and parents will more readily be found,
         without evidence of exceptional dependence".  It went on to say (in
         paragraph 61):

             "61.  Recently, the  [European  Court  of  Human  Rights]  has
             reviewed the case law, in [AA v United Kingdom [2012] Imm.  A.
             R. 1), finding that a significant factor will  be  whether  or
             not the adult child has founded a family of  his  own.   If  a
             child is still single living with his parents, he is likely to
             enjoy family life with them ...".

             The Upper Tribunal set out the relevant passage in the court's
             judgement in AA v United Kingdom (in  paragraphs  46  to  49),
             which ended with this (in paragraph 49):

                  "49.  An examination of the Court case-law would  tend  to
                  suggest that the applicant, a young adult  24  years  old,
                  who resides with his mother and  has  not  yet  founded  a
                  family of his own,  can  be  regarded  as  having  "family
                  life"."

         19.  Ultimately, as Lord Dyson  M.R.  emphasised  when  giving  the
         judgement of the court in Gurung (at paragraph 45),  "the  question
         whether an individual enjoys family life is one of fact and depends
         on  careful  consideration  of  all  the  relevant  facts  of   the
         particular case".  In some instances "an adult child  (particularly
         one who does not have  a  partner  or  children  of  his  own)  may
         establish that he has a family life with  his  parents".   As  Lord
         Dyson M.R. said, "[it]  all  depends  on  the  facts".   The  court
         expressly endorsed (at paragraph 46), as "useful" and as indicating
         "the correct approach to be adopted", the Upper  Tribunal's  review
         of the relevant  jurisprudence  in  paragraphs  50  to  62  of  its
         determination in Ghising (family life - adults  -  Gurkha  policy),
         including his observation (at paragraph 62) that  "[the]  different
         outcomes  in  cases  that  have  superficially   similar   features
         emphasises to us that the issue under Article 8(1) is highly  fact-
         sensitive".

         20.  To similar effect  were  these  observations  of  Sir  Stanley
         Burnton in Singh v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
         [2015] EWCA Civ 630 (in paragraph 24 of his judgement):

             "24.  I do not think that  the  judgements  to  which  I  have
             referred contain any difficulty  in  determining  the  correct
             approach to Article 8 in cases involving adult  children.   In
             the case of adults, in the  context  of  immigration  control,
             there is no legal or factual presumptions as to the  existence
             or absence of family life for the purposes of  Article  8.   I
             point out that the approach of  the  European  Commission  for
             Human Rights cited approvingly in Kugathas did not include any
             requirement of exceptionality.  It all depends on  the  facts.
             The love and affection between an adult  and  his  parents  or
             siblings would not of itself justify finding of a family life.
              There has to be something more.  The young adult living  with
             his parents or siblings will normally have a family life to be
             respected under Article 8.  A child  enjoying  a  family  life
             with his parents does not suddenly cease to have a family life
             at midnight as he turned 18 years of age.  On the other  hand,
             a young adult living independently of his parents may well not
             have a family life for the purposes of Article 8."

 8. In the context of a case such as the present one, the Court  of  Appeal
    went on in paragraph 39 to emphasise that "... the   real  issue  under
    article 8(1) in this case, which was whether, as a matter of fact,  the
    appellant demonstrated the family life  with  his  parents,  which  had
    existed at the time of their departure to settle in the United  Kingdom
    and had endured beyond it, notwithstanding their having left when  they
    did."

 9. There was further emphasis in paragraph 42 as to the need  to  consider
    as part of the  assessment  under  Article  8(1)  the  relevant  family
    history, stating that:

         "42.  Those circumstances of the appellant and his family,  all  of
         them uncontentious, and including - perhaps crucially  -  the  fact
         that he and his parents would have applied at the same  time  fully
         to enter the United Kingdom and  would  have  come  to  the  United
         Kingdom together as a family unit at been able to afford to do  so,
         do not appear to have been grappled  with  by  the  Upper  Tribunal
         Judge under article 8(1).  In my view they should have been.   They
         went to the heart of the matter:  the  question  of  whether,  even
         though the appellant's parents had chosen to leave Nepal to  settle
         in the United Kingdom when they did,  his  family  life  with  them
         subsisted then, and was still subsisting at the time of  the  Upper
         Tribunal's decision.  This was the critical question under  article
         8(1).  Even on the most benevolent reading of his determination,  I
         do not think one can say that the  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  properly
         addressed it."

The evidence

10. The Appellant's written statement, signed and  dated  2  February  2020
    sets out her family, details of her childhood and her parents  move  to
    the United Kingdom.  She states that her father is  entitled  to  state
    benefits in the United Kingdom and able to save some money from this to
    send to the Appellant which she uses to buy food, clothes and for other
    household expenses.  This money was sometimes transferred via other ex-
    Ghurka  soldiers  (for  which  there  are  no  receipts)  or  from  the
    Appellant's father during his visits in 2012 and 2019.   The  Appellant
    took care of her parents during these visits.

11. The Appellant is in constant contact with her parents, previously using
    international calling cards and since  2017,  using  viber  and  Skype.
    They ask  how  each  other  are  and  share  advice  to  take  care  of
    themselves.  The Appellant's parents are in poor health  and  both  are
    said to need constant support and care which only a family  member  can
    provide.  The Appellant states that it is the duty of elderly  children
    to take care of their elderly parents, which she did when they were  in
    Nepal and would continue to do if allowed to join them  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  The Appellant speaks English and would be able to  learn  new
    skills and obtain employment without being reliant on state benefits.

12. In his written statement signed and dated  23  January  2020,  Mr  Hari
    Prasad Rai (the Appellant's father) set out his family and work history
    and stated that in 2009 he heard about the new Immigration Rules for ex-
    Gurkha soldiers, following which he borrowed approximately  �1380  from
    his neighbours and applied for visas for himself and his wife to  enter
    the United Kingdom.  Those applications were granted and there  arrived
    here on 26 November 2010.  In 2015, Mr Rai knew that dependent children
    under the age of  30  were  allowed  to  join  their  parents,  but  no
    application was possible for the Appellant because she was already over
    that age.  It was not until 2019 that Mr  Rai  knew  that  older  adult
    dependent children were also being granted settlement and he then  sent
    money to his daughter to apply for entry clearance.

13. Mr Rai sets out materially identical information to  the  Appellant  in
    her  written  statement  as  to  financial  support   given   to   her,
    communication, visits to Nepal and the health conditions of himself and
    his wife.

14. Mr Rai stated that he had always wanted settle in the  United  Kingdom,
    but the policy was not available to him at the time he retired from the
    Army, if it was he would have done so and would have been able to raise
    his family in the United Kingdom.  Mr Rai is worried for his own future
    and that of the Appellant and wants her  to  join  him  in  the  United
    Kingdom so that they can all take care of each other  and  to  complete
    the family.

15. A written  statement,  signed  and  dated  23  January  2020  was  also
    available from Mrs Shabitri Rai (the Appellant's mother) which  was  in
    substance, materially identical  to  the  written  statement  from  her
    husband.

16. In the absence of hearing any further live evidence, I have had  regard
    to the record of proceedings before the First-tier Tribunal as  to  the
    oral evidence given; as well as that recorded in the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal in paragraphs 7 and 8.  The Appellant's father  was
    the only witness to give evidence.  He adopted  his  written  statement
    and stated  that  he  and  the  Appellant's  mother  pay  rent  on  the
    Appellant's property as she does not have any income.   Mr  Rai  stated
    that the Appellant had been looking for a job  but  she  did  not  have
    sufficient internationally recognisable qualifications for a  well-paid
    job and the Appellant relied on her parents instead of taking  a  local
    job as the salary for this would  be  difficult  for  her  to  maintain
    herself on.  There was no breakdown of the Appellant's expenditure.

17. The Appellant was previously given  financial  support  via  other  ex-
    Ghurkas travelling between the United Kingdom and Nepal but  there  was
    no written statement from anyone on this.  Finally,  Mr  Rai  confirmed
    that he had visited the Appellant in Nepal and would do so again if the
    appeal were dismissed.

18. The documentary evidence submitted on behalf of the Appellant included,
    inter alia, copies of passports (showing leave  to  remain  and  travel
    history); the Appellant's father's certificate of service and  official
    records; Appellant's education records; rental  agreement  between  the
    Appellant, one other person and the landlord; medical records  relating
    to the Appellant's parents; bank statements for the Appellant's parents
    from 2019; letter from Mr Bajracharya regarding loan to  the  Appellant
    in 2019 to be settled on return; schedule of financial remittances from
    September 2018 to January 2020 with accompanying receipts;  copy  viber
    and Facebook messages; and family photographs.

Submissions

19. On behalf of the  Respondent,  there  was  continued  reliance  on  the
    refusal  decision  and  the  Entry  Clearance  Manager's   review,   in
    particular that there was no  dispute  between  the  parties  that  the
    Appellant could not satisfy the requirements of the Immigration  Rules,
    nor the discretionary policy for Gurkhas discharged before 1 July 1997.
     The sole issue between the parties  is  whether  there  is  continuing
    family life between the Appellant and her parents in the United Kingdom
    to engage Article 8(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights.  The
    Respondent accepts that if family life is engaged for this purpose, the
    refusal decision would not be proportionate,  in  the  absence  of  any
    other countervailing factors to buttress the public interest and  given
    the weight to be applied to the historic injustice  in  cases  such  as
    these.

20. In support of the submission that there was no continuing family  life,
    the Respondent relies on the following facts:

      i) the Appellant was 41 years old at the date of application;

     ii) the Appellant's parents chose to leave Nepal in 2010  in  the  full
         knowledge that the Appellant would not  automatically  qualify  for
         settlement with them;

    iii) the Appellant has been apart from her parents for approximately 9 �
         years, with only two short visits in 2012 and 2019;

     iv) the Appellant's parents' written statements refer to  the  duty  of
         parents to take care of the children until they  are  married,  but
         fails to explain the delay in the application for  entry  clearance
         since 2015 when such an application became possible;

      v) there is no evidence of any care put in place for the Appellant;

     vi) there is a lack of evidence about what the Appellant does in  Nepal
         with her time;

    vii) the Appellant is fit and healthy and there was  evidence  that  she
         could not obtain employment if she  wanted  to.    The  appropriate
         inference is that she is doing something meaningful with  her  time
         in Nepal;

   viii) the viber and Facebook messages relied upon  in  evidence  were  in
         English (the correct format for evidence to the  Tribunal),  rather
         than Nepali or other ethnic language spoken in Nepal; are only of a
         relatively recent date;  lack  any  supporting  evidence  of  phone
         numbers to tie the documents to the Appellant and her  parents  and
         in the circumstances, little weight should be placed on them.

     ix) the evidence of financial remittances was limited, with no evidence
         of any financial support prior to 2018; since 2018 amounted to only
         nine remittances totalling �1175; and the financial remittances are
         not placed in context of the  Appellant's  financial  circumstances
         either in terms of  gross  income  or  net  income;  nor  is  there
         evidence of the Appellant's parents means of  support  given  their
         bank account is regularly overdrawn.  There is no audit  trail  for
         the claimed undocumented remittances  referred  to.   Further,  the
         Appellant's claimed reliance on financial support from her  parents
         is not reconcilable with taking in a lodger who pays two thirds  of
         the costs of the accommodation which she has lived in for 30  years
         or with the statement that it is the duty of children to take  care
         of their elderly parents.

21. In the written submissions made on  behalf  of  the  Appellant,  it  is
    stated in response that it was not understood that none of the  factual
    findings of the First-tier Tribunal had been preserved, particularly in
    light of the lack of  challenge  to  the  evidence  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal  and  in  these  circumstances,  it  is  submitted  that   the
    Respondent should not be permitted to make a  retrospective  attack  on
    the evidence.

22. In any event, it is  submitted  that  the  evidence  available  to  the
    Tribunal demonstrates that the Appellant's parents  are  providing  her
    with support that is real, or effective, or  committed,  sufficient  to
    meet the test for the  engagement  of  Article  8(1)  of  the  European
    Convention on  Human  Rights  in  accordance  with  the  test  in  Rai,
    nothwithstanding the Respondent's submissions on the evidence.

23. The Appellant highlights the unchallenged evidence  before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal that the Appellant has no  family  members  remaining  in
    Nepal; that the Appellant's father would have relocated and raised  his
    family in the United Kingdom upon discharge from the army if  permitted
    to do so; that the Appellant is unmarried and unemployed and that there
    was evidence that the Appellant's parents  pay  her  rent  and  she  is
    completely financially dependent on them.

24. In addition, in assessing the evidence available, the Appellant  relies
    on her father's good character, having been discharged  from  the  army
    with an exemplary record of long service and the principle that if  the
    Respondent  has  not  challenged  or  disputed   evidence   in   cross-
    examination, it is taken to be  accepted.   Fairness  requires  adverse
    matters to be put to a witness to respond to.

25. Overall, it is submitted that there  is  consistent  written  and  oral
    evidence available showing that the Appellant made  an  application  in
    2019 when her parents were first aware of the policy  changes  made  in
    2015; that the Appellant has been financially supported by her  parents
    since they came to the United Kingdom; that there  is  regular  contact
    between the Appellant and her parents, including two visits (limited to
    that number  due  to  cost  and  poor  health).   Nothwithstanding  the
    separation,  there  is  sufficient  evidence  of  the  Appellant  being
    provided with real or effective or committed support; added to which is
    the historic injustice of family life not  being  enabled  to  continue
    prior to 2015.

Findings and Reasons - the appeal

26. The Appellant raises as a preliminary matter, whether any  findings  of
    fact from the First-tier Tribunal had been preserved  and  whether  the
    Respondent can at this stage make detailed representations the evidence
    which was before the First-tier Tribunal.  At the oral  hearing,  there
    was discussion between myself and  the  parties  as  to  what,  if  any
    findings had actually been made by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  the
    possibility of whether what had been said demonstrated family life  for
    the purposes of Article  8(1)  of  the  European  Convention  on  Human
    Rights.  Mr Whitwell was unable to make any submissions  regarding  the
    evidence at the hearing  because  he  was  not  in  possession  of  the
    Appellant's bundle of evidence and I gave no indication  of   preserved
    findings.  The written directions issued to the parties  following  the
    hearing similarly did not include any preserved findings of fact.

27. The difficulty in this case, as set out above, is that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal abjectly failed in its duty to make relevant findings of  fact
    on the issues before  it  and  some  that  were  purportedly  made,  in
    relation to siblings in Nepal, were patiently incorrect and most others
    were adverse to the Appellant.   At  its  highest  and  on  a  generous
    reading of paragraphs 15 to 17 of the decision, the most that could  be
    said about relevant findings of fact in the Appellant's favour, is that
    there was a record of receipts showing  financial  remittances  to  the
    Appellant since September 2018.  This, together with references to  the
    fact that the Appellant was born in Nepal and had lived  there  all  of
    her life and that her parents chose to leave her there to come  to  the
    United Kingdom; are matters upon which there is in any event no dispute
    between the parties and which are irrelevant to the sole issue in  this
    appeal as to the engagement of family life.

28. In these circumstances, the decision of the First-tier Tribunal was  so
    poor that it was not possible to make any preserved findings  of  fact.
    It is of note that the submissions on behalf of the Appellant  on  this
    matter refer only to the evidence before the  First-tier  Tribunal  and
    not to any specific findings in the decision;  such  that  no  specific
    findings are identified which he Appellant says were uninfected by  the
    errors of law and should be preserved.  For the reasons already  given,
    it is impossible  to  identify  any  such  findings  which  could  have
    possibly been preserved and were not infected by the  clear  errors  of
    law made by the First-tier Tribunal.  For these reasons, this is  a  de
    novo  assessment  of  the  evidence  before  the  Tribunal,   following
    submissions from both parties on the same, which is in any event in the
    main, not significantly in dispute between the parties, the issue being
    whether the evidence is sufficient to support a finding of family  life
    purposes of Article 8 (1) or not.

29. The sole issue in this appeal is as to the existence of family life for
    the purposes of Article 8(1), both at the time the Appellant's parent's
    left Nepal in 2010 and whether it has endured to the present time.   As
    to the circumstances in 2010, it is not in dispute that until that time
    the Appellant was and had always lived with her  parents  in  the  same
    household in Nepal (save for intermittent periods when her  father  was
    away working) and was directly supported by  them;  such  that  I  find
    family life existed at that point.  There is also no dispute as to  the
    Appellant's father's evidence  that  if  he  could  have  sought  entry
    clearance to the United Kingdom upon discharge from the army  or  prior
    to 2009 he would have done so and if he had been able  to  do  so,  the
    Appellant may have been born here or may have been a minor or of an age
    where she was covered by the Immigration Rules or the policy  in  place
    prior to 2015.  As such, this case  is  included  within  the  accepted
    historic injustice to ex-Gurkha soldiers and their family.

30. As at the date of the  hearing  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (and
    although no updated evidence has been filed,  there  is  no  reason  to
    suspect the position is any different as  at  today's  date)  there  is
    evidence of contact between the Appellant and her parents and financial
    support from them to her.

31. The documentary evidence of contact is relatively recent  and  includes
    regular messages of a fairly routine  nature  and  a  record  of  video
    calls; together with visits to  Nepal  in  2012  and  2019.   There  is
    nothing in the  messages  that  have  been  produced  to  indicate  any
    emotional dependency between the Appellant  and  her  parents  and  the
    written statements  only  indicate  contact  of  the  sort  that  would
    normally be expected between adult children and parents, with care  and
    affection between them, inquiry as to well-being and concern that  each
    are looking after themselves and taking care.

32. The Appellant only expressly relies on  the  fact  of  regular  contact
    rather than making any submissions relying specifically on  the  nature
    of the contact.  Nor  does  the  Appellant  identify  or  rely  on  any
    specific examples of contact which could demonstrate support which  was
    real, effective or committed to the Appellant or to her parents.  There
    is nothing in the evidence available of contact  to  suggest  any  such
    support, nor to suggest any emotional dependency, it is simply  routine
    communication between adult family  members  without  more.    Although
    there is no documentary evidence of contact between 2010 and  the  more
    recent messages from 2017/18 (save  for  the  visit  in  2012),  it  is
    reasonable to infer that the Appellant has kept in regular contact with
    her parents throughout this period; however, as above,  this  does  not
    demonstrate the existence of family life for the  purposes  of  Article
    8(1).

33. As to financial support, the Appellant and her  parents  all  state  in
    their  written  evidence  that  the  Appellant  has  been   financially
    supported by her parents since 2010 and that she has no other source of
    income.  There is however a significant lack of documentary evidence to
    support these statements  and  none  which  pre-dates  September  2018.
    There are copies of receipts for  nine  financial  remittances  between
    September 2018 and January 2020 which average at �100  a  month  and  a
    letter from a third party said to be a loan agreement pursuant to which
    he handed the Appellant �400 for  the  period  January  to  April  2019
    (although there was no evidence as to whether this was repaid, by  whom
    or when).  There is however no evidence at all from the Appellant as to
    her financial circumstances, with no detail or her outgoings (save  for
    a rental agreement from 2015 stating that her monthly  rent  was  5,000
    Nepali Rupees, approximately �31.60 at current exchange rates), no bank
    statements or supporting evidence of  the  Appellant's  expenditure  at
    all.  In these circumstances, the Appellant has  not  established  that
    she has no other source of income nor that she  is  solely  financially
    dependent on her parents with the remittances of, on  average,  �100  a
    month covering all of her living and other expenses.

34. The Appellant's father stated that he gave the Appellant the money  for
    her entry clearance application in January 2019, in the  sum  of  $2014
    (approximately �1520  at  current  exchange  rates)  but  there  is  no
    evidence of any such payment or of the Appellant's parents' means to do
    so given their bank statements  regularly  show  low  balances  or  are
    overdrawn; and given  the  evidence  that  they  are,  and  have  since
    arrival, been wholly supported by state benefits in the United Kingdom.

35. Prior to September 2018, there is no documentary evidence at all of any
    financial support to the Appellant from her  parents  and  the  written
    evidence of the witnesses does not go beyond mere assertion.  There is,
    for example, not even a statement from the Appellant or her parents  as
    to how regularly financial support was provided  in  this  period,  the
    amounts sent or when this started, no names of  who  is  said  to  have
    taken money to the Appellant in Nepal by hand and no written  statement
    from any such persons (contrary to the one available from a payment  in
    January 2019).

36. Whilst on the balance of probabilities I find that at the present  time
    (and since late 2018) the Appellant has been financially  supported  by
    her parents, in a way which is sufficient to meet  the  relatively  low
    threshold of real, or  committed  or  effective  support  by  means  of
    relatively regular payments averaging around �100  a  month;  there  is
    simply no evidence of the same in the period from 2010 to August  2018.
    I do not accept the mere assertions from the Appellant and her  parents
    of continuing financial support for this period and  this  can  not  be
    inferred given the lack of any detail in their evidence as to this; the
    lack of any supporting documentation or  written  evidence  from  third
    parties and the lack of any evidence of the Appellant's parent's  means
    to provide such support.  The Appellant's father stated in his evidence
    that he borrowed approximately �1380 to apply for his  and  his  wife's
    entry clearance in 2010 and whilst  in  the  United  Kingdom  has  been
    wholly dependent on public benefits; with the combination of  debt  and
    low income not providing a basis for the couple  having  the  means  to
    have provided the Appellant with regular support  over  the  course  of
    many years.  I am not satisfied there has been financial support to the
    Appellant from her parents which has endured since they left  Nepal  in
    2010 and up to September  2018  as  there  is  nothing  beyond  a  bare
    assertion of the same in the limited evidence available.

37. In considering whether family life for the purposes of Article 8(1) has
    endured since 2010, I have in addition to  the  contact  and  financial
    evidence  considered  above,  I  have  also  taken  into  account   the
    Applicant's age at the date of application (41 years);  the  length  of
    physical separation from her parents (now around 10 years, over 8 years
    at the date of application); the family history and historic  injustice
    (including that but for this the Appellant is likely to have joined her
    parents in the United Kingdom previously); that the Applicant  has  not
    formed her own family unit (not being married or having children of her
    own) and has no other family members remaining in Nepal; the  Appellant
    is in good health and could obtain employment (even if not at a  salary
    that she could fully support herself, albeit there is  no  evidence  of
    this).  There is no evidence of any care or other needs.

38. I also take into account the complete absence of any evidence  of  what
    the Appellant has been doing in Nepal for the last ten years  and  that
    there is nothing to suggest that she has not continued to live her life
    and form an independent life for herself, particularly considering  her
    age and length of time she has lived away from her  parents,  including
    since 2015 with  another  adult  sharing  the  same  property  and  the
    evidence of communication which includes reference to a group of  other
    individuals whom it would appear the Appellant is in touch  with  as  a
    wider social group.

39. In consideration of all of the evidence in  the  round,  including  the
    absence of evidence which it would be reasonable to expect  in  a  case
    such as this; I find that the Appellant has not established that family
    life for the purposes of Article 8(1)  has  endured  with  her  parents
    since they left Nepal in 2010.  Although  there  is  relatively  recent
    evidence of financial support, the Appellant has not  established  that
    this has been in place throughout the period and  otherwise;  there  is
    nothing even cumulatively in  the  evidence  to  establish  an  ongoing
    relationship involving support which is real, effective or committed to
    the Appellant which has endured for nearly ten years.  The Appellant is
    a middle aged  woman  who  has  lived  independently  in  Nepal  for  a
    significant period of time, who is fit and healthy and able  to  obtain
    employment; and in relation to whom the majority of the evidence points
    to a normal relationship between her as an adult child with her parents
    without more.

40. For these reasons, Article 8(1) of the  European  Convention  on  Human
    Rights is not engaged and it is not therefore necessary  to  go  on  to
    consider whether the decision was a disproportionate interference.



Notice of Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of a material error of law.  As such it is  necessary  to  set  aside
the decision.

I set aside the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  re-make  it  as
follows:

The appeal is dismissed on human rights grounds.

No anonymity direction is made.
