                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    O'Brien, promulgated on 22 March 2017. Permission to appeal was granted
    by First-tier Tribunal Judge M Robertson on 5 October 2017.



Anonymity

 2. No direction has been made previously, and there is no reason  for  one
    now

Background

 3. The appellant entered the United Kingdom  during  September  2010  with
    entry clearance as a Tier 4 migrant. He was granted  further  leave  to
    remain as a spouse until 17 February 2015. The appellant's  application
    for indefinite leave to remain as a spouse was refused on  21  November
    2015 and it is this decision which is the subject of this appeal.

 4. The respondent's reasons for refusing  the  said  application  were  as
    follows.  It  was  considered  that  the  appellant  had  submitted   a
    fraudulently  obtained  English  language  test  certificate  with  his
    application for  leave  to  remain  as  a  spouse  made  in  2012.  The
    respondent was therefore satisfied that the  appellant's  presence  was
    not conducive to the public good and  that  the  application  fell  for
    refusal under  S-LTR2.2  of  Appendix  FM  of  the  Immigration  Rules.
    Furthermore,  the  respondent  was  not  satisfied  that   there   were
    insurmountable obstacles preventing the appellant from  continuing  his
    relationship with his wife in  Pakistan.  There  were  said  to  be  no
    exceptional circumstances.

The hearing before the First-tier Tribunal

 5. At the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal, the parties agreed  that
    the sole issue was whether the appellant used  deception  or  not.  The
    judge found that the respondent had discharged the initial burden  upon
    her but that the appellant had not discharged  his  evidential  burden.
    The human rights appeal was simply dismissed without reasons. The judge
    also dismissed the appeal under the Immigration Rules.

The grounds of appeal

 6. The grounds of appeal argued that  the  judge  erred  in  finding  that
    paragraph  322(1A)  and  SLTR.2.2  of   the   Rules   were   identical.
    Furthermore, it was argued that neither applied. The judge was said  to
    have erred in failing  to  appreciate  the  very  low  threshold  which
    applied to the appellant in providing an innocent explanation.  It  was
    contended that the judge failed to engage with the appellant's evidence
    relating to the test itself, including that he travelled  to  the  test
    with his wife and she confirmed the same. In addition, it was said  the
    judge  failed  to  appreciate  that  the  respondent  was  required  to
    discharge a legal burden. The concession which was made  regarding  the
    scope of the appeal was wrong in law because the judge was required  to
    consider Article 8  outside  the  Rules.  Reference  was  made  to  the
    appellant's relationship with his British stepchildren  as  well  as  a
    Zambrano argument which the judge failed to consider.

 7. Permission to appeal was  granted  on  the  basis  sought,  with  Judge
    Robertson noting that the  only  ground  of  appeal  available  to  the
    appellant was Article 8.

 8. No respondent's Rule 24 reply was received.

The hearing

 9. Mr Karim succinctly set out his arguments. Firstly, he argued that  the
    judge wrongly referred to paragraph 322(1A) of the Rules  which  itself
    referred to the current application  under  consideration  whereas  the
    TOEIC was submitted in a previous application. Secondly, the judge  had
    failed to engage with the evidence of the appellant's wife in  relation
    to the deception issue and other matters which went in the  appellant's
    favour. Thirdly, the judge had wrongly accepted a  concession  made  by
    the appellant's previous counsel regarding Article 8 and there had been
    no assessment of matters relevant to a proportionality assessment.

10. Mr Clarke urged me to find that the grounds were without merit  and  to
    dismiss the appeal. On the first ground, he conceded that the  decision
    letter was wrong to refer to suitability under Appendix FM  given  that
    the appellant made his application under paragraph 287 of the Rules. He
    also conceded that the appeal was not under the Rules but under Article
    8 only. It was therefore appropriate for the judge  to  view  the  case
    through the lens of public  interest  concerns.  Regarding  the  second
    ground,  he  argued  that  the  judge  directed  himself  appropriately
    regarding what was said in SM and Qadir(ETS  -  Evidence  -  Burden  of
    Proof) [2016]UKUT 00229 (IAC) and in any event the evidence  had  since
    moved on. He referred me to the cases of Abbas [2017] EWHC  78  (Admin)
    and Nawaz [2017] UKUT 00288 (IAC) in that respect, commenting that  the
    appellant was in a difficult position given the low  figure  for  false
    positives referred to in Abbas as well as the Operation Faï¿½ade evidence
    in this case. He argued that the judge  took  into  consideration  that
    candidates did attend test centres where pilots were used  as  well  as
    his ability to speak English. On the third ground, the concession  made
    by previous counsel was that  the  appeal  "stands  or  falls"  on  the
    deception issue and the appellant was required to make a positive  case
    at the First-tier Tribunal that  there  was  enough  in  his  claim  to
    outweigh a deception finding.

11. In reply, Mr Karim emphasised that in Abbas  the  administrative  court
    had said that all that was required  of  a  claimant  was  a  plausible
    explanation of a minimum level of plausibility. He argued that with his
    wife's evidence, the appellant had achieved this. Assuming there was  a
    concession, a failure to have regard to Article 8 and section 55 of the
    Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009  had  to  be  a  material
    error of law.

12. Mr Clarke added that it could not be  right  that  there  was  a  lower
    standard of proof for the appellant in TOEIC  cases,  Re  B  (children)
    [2008] UKHL 35 applied.  At the end  of  the  hearing,  I  reserved  my
    decision on the error  of  law  issue.  I  invited  comments  from  the
    representatives as to the next steps were I to find a material error of
    law. For his part, Mr Clarke argued that if the judge was wrong on  the
    applicable Rule, it was open to the next judge  to  apply  the  correct
    Rule, considering, RM (Kwok On Tong : HC 395, para  320)  India  [2006]
    UKAIT 39. Both representatives agreed that if I found  that  the  judge
    erred in failing to consider Article 8, the appeal should  go  back  to
    the First-tier. Mr Karim added that  the  issue  of  the  correct  Rule
    should also be remitted to the First-tier.

Decision on error of law

13. Starting with the third ground, this was  an  appeal  solely  on  human
    rights grounds and a reasoned decision on that basis was  conspicuously
    absent  from  the  judge's  findings.  Notwithstanding   the   apparent
    concession from the appellant's counsel, on the unchallenged  facts  of
    this case, even with a finding that deception was used, it was  obvious
    that a proportionality assessment was required, (R v SSHD, IAT ex parte
    Anthonypillai Francis Robinson [1997] EWCA  Civ  2089)  applied.  Those
    facts included that the appellant had been married to his British  wife
    for over five years and was previously granted leave to remain on  that
    basis; that the appellant is stepfather to his  wife's  three  children
    one of whom is a minor; that the appellant and his  wife  looked  after
    his wife's grandchild three days a week; that the wife's  parents  were
    aged in their eighties and rely on the couple for care; that  the  wife
    is a longstanding sufferer of depression and  had  a  recent  breakdown
    owing to the stress of the appellant's immigration issues and that  she
    is of not of Pakistani origin and would find it impossible to adapt  to
    the lifestyle and culture in  Pakistan.  In  these  circumstances,  the
    failure to assess the basis of the appellant's appeal  was  a  material
    error of law. Thus, as  the  appellant  has  yet  to  have  a  judicial
    assessment of his human rights' claim, the decision to refuse the human
    rights appeal is set aside for consideration afresh by a Judge  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

14. Regarding the first ground; it is accepted that the decision letter  in
    this  case  wrongly  identified  the  basis  for  the  refusal  of  the
    application for settlement, referring  to  S-LTR.2.2  Appendix  FM.  At
    [13], the judge records that the appellant "accepted that there was  no
    material difference between  S-LTR2.2  of  Appendix  FM  and  paragraph
    322(1A) of the Rules." This concession was rightly made given that both
    these provisions refer to deception being used in the application under
    consideration, however neither Rule was  relevant  to  the  appellant's
    circumstances, where it  was  alleged  that  he  used  deception  in  a
    previous application.  Consequently,  the  judge  materially  erred  in
    considering that the appellant's application fell at paragraph  322(1A)
    of the Rules. I would add that the onus ought to be on  the  respondent
    rather than a judge to identify the general ground  of  refusal  relied
    upon in circumstances where the  decision  letter  does  not  give  any
    indication. The judge's findings on this  matter  are,  therefore,  set
    aside in their entirety and the issue is to be considered afresh  by  a
    First-tier Tribunal judge.

15. On the second ground, the  judge's  reasons  for  concluding  that  the
    appellant  had  not  put  forward  an  innocent  explanation   appeared
    adequate. I have therefore carefully considered whether this aspect  of
    the decision could be preserved. Ultimately, I find merit in Mr Karim's
    submissions that important aspects of the appellant's explanation  were
    not included in the judge's consideration and that these could have had
    a material impact on the decision, given what was said in  Abbas  about
    an  explanation  needing  only  to  achieve  the  "minimum   level   of
    plausibility."  Those  aspects  included  the  detailed,  unchallenged,
    evidence of the appellant's wife, set out at [3-4] which went  directly
    to the deception issue; that the appellant  required  only  a  pass  at
    level A1 to obtain leave to remain as a spouse  in  2012  and  that  no
    allegation had been raised regarding the appellant's passes in  reading
    and writing.

16. The failure to include these issues when considering whether  deception
    was used renders the decision unsafe and consequently, the findings  of
    the judge on this matter are also set aside in their entirety.

Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error of on a point of law.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  is  set  aside,  with  no  findings
preserved.

The appeal is remitted, de novo, to the First-tier Tribunal  to  be  reheard
at Taylor House, with a time estimate of 3 hours by any judge except  First-
tier Tribunal Judge O'Brien.
