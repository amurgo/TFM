                       NOTICE OF ABANDONMENT OF APPEAL



 1. This appeal was last before me on 12 August  2013,  following  which  I
    gave directions that it was to be listed again on 11 November 2013.   I
    recorded that it was anticipated that by that date it was  likely  that
    the respondent would have granted the appellant leave to remain.

 2. As anticipated, the respondent has now granted the appellant  leave  to
    remain for 30 months, and both parties are now agreed that  the  appeal
    should be treated as abandoned.

 3. Accordingly, pursuant to paragraph 17A of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper
    Tribunal) Rules 2008, I record that the appeal is now to be treated  as
    abandoned under Section 104(4A) of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002, because  the  appellant  has  been  granted  leave  to
    remain.





Signed:                                 Dated: 11 November 2013
