Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Walker, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr S Bellara, Counsel, instructed by Legend
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. For the purposes of this Decision I shall refer to the parties as  they
    were before the First-tier Tribunal.  Therefore the Secretary of  State
    is once more the Respondent and Mr Vijayaraghavan Parthiban, his  wife,
    and their child are the Appellants.

 2. This is a challenge by the Respondent against a decision of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Shiner, (the judge), promulgated on 23  March  2017,  in
    which he dismissed the appeals on human rights grounds but allowed them
    on the basis that the Respondent's decisions of 17 February  2015  were
    not in accordance with the law.

 3. These proceedings have something of  a  history  to  them  and  I  will
    summarise it here.  Following  the  Respondent's  initial  decision  to
    refuse leave to  enter,  the  Appellants  appealed  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  The appeals were heard by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Lucas
    who, in a decision promulgated on 23 February 2016, allowed them on the
    basis that the Respondent should look again  at  the  cases  (in  other
    words, he purported the "remit" them).  The decision of Judge Lucas was
    successfully challenged by the  Respondent,  that  decision  being  set
    aside by Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Ramshaw.   The  appeals  were  all
    remitted to the First-tier  Tribunal.   They  then  came  before  Judge
    Shiner.

 4. Following the promulgation of his decision both the Appellants and  the
    Respondent made applications for permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal.  On 22 September 2017 First-tier Tribunal Judge Boyes refused
    the Appellants' application but granted the Respondent's.  As confirmed
    at  the  hearing  before  me,  the  Appellants  did  not  renew   their
    application to  the  Upper  Tribunal  and  therefore  it  is  only  the
    Respondent's challenge to the decision of the judge which is before me.

The Judge's decision

 5. At paragraph 27 the judge  records  the  Presenting  Officer's  express
    concession that the Respondent was not  pursuing  a  case  against  the
    Appellant based on the TOEIC/ETS issue.  Then, having made a number  of
    adverse credibility findings relating to the Appellant's conduct in the
    United Kingdom, the judge finds that the Appellant had not in fact been
    effectively served with a curtailment decisions dated 21 January  2015.
    In light of this last conclusion the judge found that the  Respondent's
    decisions under appeal were not in  accordance  with  the  law  and  he
    allowed the appeal on this limited basis.  In respect of Article  8  he
    undertook a perfectly adequate assessment of all relevant  matters  and
    dismissed the appeal under that head of claim.

The grounds of appeal

 6. Somewhat unfortunately the drafter  of  the  grounds  appears  to  have
    failed to take note of what is said in  paragraph  27  of  the  judge's
    decision regarding the ETS issue.  The  grounds  assert  that  the  ETS
    point should have been dealt with: in the event, this  issue  had  been
    conceded  by  the  Presenting  Officer.   Ground  2  relates   to   the
    curtailment point, and it is said that  the  judge  failed  to  provide
    reasons as to why he concluded that the curtailment decisions  had  not
    been served.

The hearing before me

 7. Very sensibly, Mr Walker confirmed  at  the  outset  that  he  was  not
    pursing the ground of appeal relating to the ETS issue.   He  confirmed
    that having discussed the remaining matter with Mr Bellara, he accepted
    that there had been no  evidence  before  the  judge  as  to  effective
    service of the curtailment decisions dated 21 January 2015.   In  light
    of this, Mr Walker conceded that the judge had not fallen into error by
    concluding that there had been no service  and  that  the  Respondent's
    decisions were not in accordance with the law.

 8. Unsurprisingly, Mr Bellara agreed with this position.  He  acknowledged
    that under the amended 2000 Order, service could have been affected  in
    a number of different ways.  However, there has simply been no evidence
    before the judge as to any of the various possibilities arising out  of
    Article 8ZA and Article 8ZB of the 2000 Order.

My decision on error of law

 9. I agree with both representatives that there are no material errors  of
    law in the judge's decision.  He was entitled to find that there was no
    (or at least no adequate) evidence before him to show that  service  of
    the curtailment decisions had been affected within  the  scope  of  the
    amended 2000 Order.  It follows that he was perfectly entitled to allow
    the appeals on the limited basis that the decisions of  the  Respondent
    were not in accordance with the law.  This is because of  the  date  of
    the decisions under appeal, which  had  the  effect  that  the  current
    proceedings have operated under the old provisions of the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (prior to the amendments brought in  by
    the 2014 Act).  Thus, the multiple grounds of  appeal  available  under
    the 'old' section 84  were  in  play,  and  the  judge  had  the  wider
    jurisdiction under the 'old' section 86.

10. In light of the above the decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands.




Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not contain material errors  of
law.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands.

The Respondent must now issue fresh decisions in respect of the  Appellants.


No anonymity direction is made.

TO THE RESPONDENT

FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make fee awards  of
�140.00 in respect of each appeal,  this  being  a  total  of  �420.00.  The
Appellants (the original applicants) have succeeded  in  their  appeals  and
this is essentially because the Respondent has failed to adduce evidence.
