Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr A Gilbert, instructed by Rahman & Company
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr D Hayes, Home Office Presenting Officer

(1)  All  Turkish  males  are  required  to  undergo  military  service  but
    exemption  can  be  granted  on  the  grounds  of  physical  or  mental
    disability which includes "sexual identity disorder".

(2)  Homosexuality is regarded by the Turkish  army  as  a  sexual  identity
    disorder but the perception of homosexuality in Turkey is  not  reduced
    to a person's sexual preference but is informed by an assessment of his
    whole personality including his outward appearance and behaviour. It is
    associated with the passive role  which  is  seen  as  unmanly  whereas
    taking the active role does not attract the same disapproval and is not
    considered to undermine the essence of manliness.

(3)  The exemption process for determining whether a recruit is entitled  to
    exemption  generally  includes  intrusive  requirements  which  do  not
    properly respect the human dignity of  someone  whose  sexual  identity
    would  qualify  him  for  exemption  such  that  it  can  properly   be
    categorised as degrading and involving a  real  risk  of  a  breach  of
    article 3.

(4)  If during his military service a recruit (whether  he  has  not  sought
    exemption or has been refused) is discovered  or  is  perceived  to  be
    homosexual as understood in Turkey, there is  a  reasonable  degree  of
    likelihood  of  ill-treatment  of  sufficient  severity  to  amount  to
    persecution on the basis  of  his  sexual  identity  and  there  is  no
    sufficiency of protection. The risk of  such  discovery  or  perception
    arising during his service will require a fact sensitive analysis of an
    individual's particular  circumstances  including  his  appearance  and
    mannerisms, the way in which he  describes  his  sexual  identity,  the
    extent to which he fits the stereotype of a  homosexual  as  understood
    within Turkish society and the extent to  which  he  will  conceal  his
    sexual identity for reasons not arising from a fear of persecution.

(5)  Any such risk likely to arise during service  is  not  negated  by  the
    fact that there is an exemption process as that process itself  carries
    a real risk of a breach of article 3.

(6)  MS (Risk- Homosexual) Turkey  CG  [2002]  UKIAT  is  no  longer  to  be
    regarded as providing country guidance.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal by the appellant, a  citizen  of  Turkey,  against  a
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal dismissing his appeal  against  the
    respondent's decision of 28 October 2011 to  remove  him  from  the  UK
    following a decision that he was not entitled to asylum.  In a decision
    dated 14 September 2012 the Upper Tribunal found  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal had erred in law and its  decision  was  set  aside.   Further
    directions were given on 26 November 2012 and 15 February 2013 so  that
    the re-making of the decision  could  proceed  as  a  country  guidance
    determination, enabling the Tribunal to give guidance on whether  there
    was a risk of persecution, serious  harm  or  breach  of  human  rights
    arising from the sexual identity of someone liable  to  be  called  for
    national service in the Turkish Armed Forces ("TAF"), and  in  relation
    both to the exemption process and the risk of serious harm  during  his
    service.  Both members of the panel have contributed to the writing  of
    this determination.

Background

2.   The appellant is a Turkish national born in November  1978.   He  first
    came to the UK in 2001 with a valid student visa and on  15  July  2002
    and 31 October 2003 he made in-country applications for  extensions  of
    his leave and was granted further leave to  remain  until  31  December
    2004.  After the expiry of his leave he did not return  to  Turkey  but
    remained in the UK and next came to the attention  of  the  authorities
    when on 26 October 2011 he was arrested by  the  Northern  Constabulary
    following a domestic  incident  between  himself  and  his  partner  in
    Inverness.  His immigration status was checked  and  according  to  the
    respondent's records the appellant did not give his own but  a  similar
    name.  The UK Border Agency had no  trace  of  that  name  and  he  was
    further arrested.  On 28 October 2011 he was interviewed.  He gave  his
    correct name and said that he wanted to claim asylum.

3.   In his screening interview on 28 October 2011 he accepted that  he  had
    arrived in the UK with a student visa using his own passport.  He  said
    that his passport had now been lost and  accepted  that  his  leave  to
    remain had expired at the end of December 2004.  He claimed that he had
    been diagnosed as HIV positive in Turkey ten years previously  but  had
    never had any treatment for this.   He  suffered  from  depression  and
    thought he had a tumour on his liver.  He would be subject to arrest on
    return to Turkey for evading military service.  When asked why he could
    not return to Turkey he said  because  of  his  health  condition,  his
    sexual choices and his military service.

4.   He was interviewed further about his claim on 2  December  2011.   When
    asked why he was claiming asylum he said that there were a few reasons.
     The first  related  to  his  political  choices  against  the  Turkish
    government and the army and being forced to do military service  for  a
    year and he could not  do  anything  else  before  completing  this  in
    Turkey.  He could not get a job and could not legally leave because  he
    had an arrest warrant  already.   The  second  related  to  his  sexual
    choices and his health condition.  He was a gay bisexual and  had  HIV.
    He had serious concerns about living in Turkey and dying from HIV.   He
    could not be open and clear about his sexuality and his choices; he had
    to be discreet about it, but with his illness that would not  be  easy.
    He then explained about how his family had  come  to  learn  about  his
    sexuality and set out the relationships  he  had  had.   He  was  asked
    whether other things had happened before he left Turkey for the UK.  He
    said nothing significantly bad except verbal insults but he had  always
    had to hide his sexuality in every environment, work, school or family.
     He did not even want to think about the public's reaction.   He  would
    be judged, bullied or discriminated against by the majority of  people.



5.   He was asked whether he eventually intended to return  to  Turkey  when
    he initially came to the UK and he replied not necessarily,  he  wanted
    to stay here mainly because of the difficulties he had back home.  When
    asked when he was diagnosed with being HIV positive, he thought it  was
    a year after he came to the UK.  In his screening interview he had said
    it was roughly ten years ago and he did say  that  it  was  in  the  UK
    whereas it had been written down that he had been referring to  Turkey.
    He was asked if he had any documentary evidence of his  condition.   He
    replied that he did not but said that he would prove it as soon  as  he
    could.  He was asked when the arrest warrant issued with regard to  him
    doing military service was issued and he reckoned that since 2005 there
    must have been an arrest warrant for him but he had not seen  it.   The
    police had been to his home and contacted his parents  about  where  he
    was.  His mother had told him he had to go to  the  police  station  to
    make a declaration of where he was and what he was doing.  He  produced
    what he described as a recent letter dated 2011.  His mother had to  go
    to the police station a few times in 2006, 2007 and 2008.  He confirmed
    that he had been living a bisexual lifestyle in the UK because  he  had
    freedom to do so and could go out and socialise at gay bars.

6.   When asked what he thought would  happen  to  him  if  he  returned  to
    Turkey he said that he came from a very conservative family and leaving
    all obstacles aside such as military service or other settling problems
    like finding a job, which would  be  impossible  due  to  his  military
    service, he could not come clean about his health condition  to  anyone
    including his parents.  He could not be a gay man  dying  from  HIV  as
    this would cause so much grief and devastation for everybody.  He would
    be forced to go into  the  army  and  probably  fight  against  Kurdish
    people.  As a socialist he did not agree with Turkey's actions in  this
    respect.  He would not be able to  get  a  job  or  have  any  possible
    financial  solution  because  of  his  military  service   and   health
    conditions.  If the British government needed to  contact  the  Turkish
    government  for  any  documentation  this  would   make   things   more
    complicated for him.  He would surely get arrested  and  questioned  as
    the Turkish authorities did not like people seeking asylum or  help  on
    human rights grounds.

7.   The respondent's decision is set out in the Reasons for Refusal  Letter
    dated 19 December 2011.  Having reviewed the  evidence  the  respondent
    did not accept that the  appellant  was  bisexual,  that  he  had  been
    diagnosed with HIV/AIDS or that  he  had  evaded  military  service  in
    Turkey.  His claim for asylum was rejected in its entirety  [31].   The
    respondent noted that the appellant had come to the UK in 2001  at  the
    age of 22/23.  According to information  available  to  the  respondent
    about military service in Turkey, male Turkish citizens  were  required
    to report to military draft branches between 1 January and  31  October
    of the year of their 20th birthday or provide documentary  evidence  to
    show they were unable to  do  so,  e.g.  medical  reasons  or  being  a
    student.  It was considered that the appellant had either completed his
    military service prior to coming to the UK or had produced evidence  to
    postpone it.  The respondent noted that the appellant's last  grant  of
    leave expired on 31 December 2004 but he had made no application of any
    kind to  regularise  his  stay  until  claiming  asylum  after  he  was
    apprehended by the police and immigration  authorities  on  26  October
    2011, having overstayed for almost seven years.   She  considered  that
    the appellant had not provided a reasonable explanation for failing  to
    inform the  UK  authorities  of  his  circumstances  or  attempting  to
    regularise his  stay  and  had  not  claimed  asylum  at  the  earliest
    opportunity.  When arrested he initially gave a false name and date  of
    birth and this  further  damaged  his  credibility.   In  summary,  the
    respondent was not satisfied that the appellant  qualified  either  for
    asylum or relief under the Human Rights Act.   For  these  reasons  his
    application was refused.

8.   His appeal against this decision was heard by the  First-tier  Tribunal
    on 21 February 2012 but subsequently set aside by the  Upper  Tribunal.
    The Upper Tribunal's reasons for finding an error of law such that  the
    decision should be set aside are set out in a Decision  and  Directions
    dated 14 September 2012, attached to this  determination  as  Annex  1.
    Following the directions given for the re-making of the  decision,  the
    following evidence was filed for the appellant:  bundles  (A1)  witness
    statements,  indexed  and  paginated  1-30,  (A2)  expert  reports  and
    material  1-212,  (A3)  background  evidence  1-367,  (A4)   background
    evidence 368-711, (A5) authorities.  The respondent filed a  bundle  of
    background evidence (R) divided into tabs  1-39.   A  schedule  of  the
    background evidence is attached at Annex 2 and of the  expert  evidence
    and material at Annex 3.  We heard oral evidence from the appellant and
    two witnesses K and A giving evidence about his sexual  identity,  from
    Ulrika B�hnish who made a documentary (C�r�k -  The  Pink  Report)  and
    expert evidence from Dr Ozgur �inar and Julian Irlenk�user.

(i)  The Appellant's Evidence

9.   The appellant's evidence is set out  in  his  witness  statement  of  7
    February 2012 (A1, 7-15 and his supplementary statement of 20 May 2013,
    A1, 1-6).  In these witness statements he confirms that he is  bisexual
    and says that he was around 13 to 14 years old when he realised that he
    had  feelings  for  men  in  addition  to  women.   He  describes   his
    relationship with a boy who lived nearby and the suspicions his  mother
    had about their relationship.  His first sexual experience with a woman
    was when he was about 17 or 18, a relationship which lasted  about  two
    years.  He started university in September 1996 when he  was  still  in
    this relationship but at university he entered into a relationship with
    a man from Bosnia.  They knew they had to keep  their  relationship  as
    discreet as they could, as in Turkey it was not acceptable for two  men
    to be with each other.  They did not want to be totally  in  hiding  as
    they wanted to have freedom.  However, they were the victims of  verbal
    abuse and homophobic remarks.  In June 2007 his mother  discovered  the
    appellant and his boyfriend in bed together and became hysterical.  She
    told his father who was seriously angry.  The  appellant  had  a  fight
    with his father and was ordered to leave the family home  and  told  he
    was no longer a member of the family.

10.  The appellant completed his university degree in  December  2000  after
    taking his last exam.  In the UK he has had relationships with both men
    and women, saying that in this country he was able to be open and  free
    about his sexuality.  Until a few weeks before his statement he thought
    he had contracted HIV.  About a year after coming to the UK he had  had
    unprotected intercourse with a man and after about six to  eight  weeks
    started to feel very ill.  His glands  came  up  in  his  neck  and  he
    started having pains in his neck and  shoulders.   He  started  to  get
    diarrhoea and suffered from fevers.  He went to hospital in Chelsea and
    a test was done which showed that he was HIV positive.  When the  tests
    were done he had given a different name as he was very ashamed  of  his
    situation and did not want to use his real name.   After  he  made  his
    claim for asylum he did try to register with a  GP  so  that  he  could
    obtain some medical attention and eventually he was able to do so.   He
    had further tests which showed that actually he did not have  HIV.   He
    was shocked at this news.  Obviously it was good  news  to  him  but  a
    shock as he thought he had had HIV for a long time.  He explained  this
    to the staff at the STD clinic and  they  thought  he  might  have  had
    another condition which had effects similar to HIV and he was  referred
    to his GP but further blood tests have shown no  abnormality.   He  had
    not been able to get a copy of the original HIV test in 2002.   He  had
    telephoned the hospital but they said without identification they could
    not disclose any details.

11.  He said that he was  wanted  in  Turkey  as  he  had  not  carried  out
    military service.  When studying he had not  had  to  undertake  actual
    service.   The  university  would  automatically  inform  the  relevant
    authorities that their call up papers should not  be  sent.   After  he
    finished his education the rules allowed one year to decide what he was
    going to do.  If he had wanted to continue  with  higher  education  he
    could have his service postponed even further.  He was not in favour of
    military service because he was  not  a  supporter  of  war  and  armed
    conflict and had always disliked the military.  When he  thought  about
    his situation following completing his degree, he felt the best  option
    was to leave Turkey to study.  Going to another  country  like  the  UK
    would allow him to live where he could practise his  sexuality  without
    constant worry.

12.  In around January 2002 he went to the  Turkish  Embassy  in  London  to
    inform them that he was in the UK continuing with  his  education.   He
    told them this because he knew it would give him the right to  postpone
    further his military service and stop the authorities from issuing  any
    notices.  He was only allowed to defer his service for another year  to
    eighteen months because he was only studying a language  course.   Once
    that period expired he knew he would be required to carry out  military
    service.  Towards the end of 2004 to  the  beginning  of  2005  he  was
    contacted by his sister who told him  that  the  authorities  had  been
    coming to his parents' house and trying to find out if he had  returned
    to Turkey.  His sister used to call him regularly over  the  years  and
    told him the authorities  were  still  coming  and  asking  about  him.
    Before his asylum interview he had got in touch with a friend of his in
    Turkey, asking him to try and send over any document to  show  that  he
    was required for military service.  The  friend  later  contacted  him,
    saying he had spoken to the authorities and he had obtained a  document
    which he forwarded to the appellant.  The document and its  translation
    appear at A1, 14-18.  He had received it before  his  asylum  interview
    and mentioned it but he was confused and forgot  to  bring  it  to  the
    attention of his solicitor and so it had not been sent in earlier.

13.  When he came to the UK he was glad to leave Turkey behind,  because  in
    the UK he could  be  open  about  his  sexuality  and  not  fear  being
    discovered with the prospect of ill-treatment and  persecution  by  the
    public and authorities.  When his visa expired in December 2004 he  was
    suffering from depression brought on mainly by the belief that  he  was
    HIV positive.  This had a big impact on him and affected his ability to
    plan things.  He had no money and was in  no  position  to  extend  his
    visa. He did not want to be sent back to Turkey as he felt he would  be
    forced to carry out military service or face being sent to prison.   He
    felt his only real choice was to stay in the UK.  He was aware  he  had
    the option of claiming asylum but did not do so because of his fear  of
    being refused and deported.  When  arrested  in  October  2011  he  was
    scared of being sent back to Turkey and that was the reason for  giving
    false details.  When he did claim asylum,  he  had  said  that  if  his
    application was refused he would go back to  Turkey  himself  arranging
    his own passport.  This was because if he went back  himself  he  would
    try  to  find  some  way  of  getting  into  the  country  without  the
    authorities finding out.

14.  In his supplementary statement he said he had reacted very  badly  when
    he learnt that he was HIV positive.  He would spend days at a  time  in
    his room drinking and after four to five months he went to a clinic for
    antidepressants but had not used them for long.  He kept his  condition
    hidden from everyone.  It had been a massive shock when he learned that
    in fact he was HIV negative.  He was now able to  meet  people  with  a
    view to forming relationships without hiding his medical issue.  He had
    not told his girlfriend C that he was HIV positive and she had been the
    only person with whom he had had a sexual relationship, who was not HIV
    positive but he always used protection. Since his previous statement he
    had met two or three men and  had  casual  sex  but  had  not  had  any
    relationship with a woman.  His male partners had known his  sexuality.
    He did not really go out to clubs on a regular basis but  preferred  to
    go out with friends for a quiet meal or drink.   His  one  relationship
    that was more serious, having started casually, was with  K.   He  knew
    him as he used to organise single gay men's drink parties  and  dinners
    in various restaurants.  There came a stage when they met after  dinner
    and formed a relationship, sleeping with each other and going out as  a
    couple.  This lasted for about three or four months but they still  met
    up on occasions.

15.  He confirmed that he had kept in contact with his sister on  a  regular
    basis, speaking to her every two months or so, but had had  no  contact
    with his parents since he left the family home.  He  did  not  want  to
    report to the authorities if he had to return to Turkey.  He would  not
    want to disclose the fact that he was bisexual to the  authorities  and
    did not want to have to go through the  humiliation  of  proving  this.
    However, this would be a better option than staying silent and starting
    military service.  If it was discovered that he  was  gay  or  bisexual
    during his service the consequences would be very bad as  he  would  be
    bullied, beaten or attacked by fellow recruits or senior officers.   He
    might also be punished in other ways  and  he  would  not  want  to  go
    through that.

16.  In the UK he had been living openly as a bisexual and had  become  used
    to this way of life.  If he went back to Turkey he would  not  be  open
    about his sexuality to people he did not know.  He would go out to  gay
    clubs and bars and interact with gays and bisexuals but would not do it
    as often as in the UK and would be reserved if he had  to  do  military
    service.  He felt there was a real risk that  during  military  service
    his sexuality would be discovered.  He  had  been  told  that  soldiers
    found to be gay had been beaten, punished by the military and detained.
     He was aware that there was an option that he might be asked to  bring
    a family member to see the military authorities but there  was  no  way
    that his parents would help him gain exemption in this way and  it  was
    something his sister would not be willing to do.  He  had  raised  this
    issue with her on the telephone but she was not willing to  talk  about
    his sexuality with him or anyone else.  He would reveal  his  sexuality
    to the military and suffer the humiliation of getting  exempt  on  that
    basis.

17.  In his oral evidence the appellant confirmed that his  statements  were
    accurate.  He explained how he had been completely "freaked out" by his
    test diagnosis in  2002  and  had  been  too  immature  to  handle  it.
    Initially he had not intended to receive treatment but later started to
    think about it.  He did not have the strength to face what had happened
    and he became depressed.   He  got  into  the  state  of  delaying  and
    postponing things.  He said that if he went back  to  Turkey  he  could
    create his own social life but there would be times when he  could  not
    and he would have to hide his sexual identity.  He  would  always  seek
    people out he could relate to who made the same sexual choice  as  him.
    But there were circumstances when he would hide this,  for  example  if
    starting a job and from  some  old  friends  whom  he  knew  from  past
    experience would not be positive.  Initially, he would go  to  Istanbul
    where there would be more opportunities to survive and then he would go
    to the south of Turkey where he would have more  freedom,  particularly
    where there were a lot of tourists and life was a lot more chilled  out
    and other sexual choices were more acceptable.  He would hide  this  if
    in the military as they would not like his sexual choices and  lots  of
    other things about him.  He would not be able to choose who he would be
    with.  Things would be very difficult.  He  thought  if  discovered  he
    would be abused, bullied  or  attacked  at  a  personal  level  and  be
    detained or forced to do unfair duties.

18.  In cross-examination he said that he had tried  to  put  his  confusion
    about his sexual identity aside.   When  he  was  young  he  had  still
    continued to question these things.  At university  he  had  felt  more
    relaxed and comfortable and could try to be more  open.   He  did  feel
    attracted to women.  When attracted to his  first  girlfriend  he  said
    that it was not love but he thought  it  had  been  at  the  time.   He
    explained that when he went to university he had moved from  Samsun  in
    the north of Turkey to Istanbul, where his father worked,  and  he  and
    his mother moved to live with him.  This was why he had not moved  into
    university accommodation at that stage.  He had stayed  with  them  for
    about one and a  half  years  before  the  troubles  arising  from  his
    relationship with one of his fellow students.   This  had  led  to  the
    break-up of his family.  He had never spoken again to  his  father  but
    had  on  a  few  occasions  with  his  mother.   His  father  was  very
    conservative, believed in Islam and that his type of  sexual  behaviour
    was not allowed.  After the fight with his father he  did  not  try  to
    reconcile with him as he knew he would always be  judged  by  him.   He
    knew what his father thought and did not bother to  try  and  reconnect
    with him.  He had not had an HIV test in Turkey even though he had  had
    intercourse there.  There were no test results or  paperwork  he  could
    produce in relation to the 2002 test in London as he had used  a  false
    name but the test result was HIV positive.  He accepted  that  at  that
    time he would have access to healthcare in this country but  said  that
    he was scared of being judged and was not  ready  to  discuss  or  talk
    about the issue.

19.  He confirmed that he had returned to Turkey on two  occasions  but  had
    not wanted to live there.  He was petrified of having AIDS and dying in
    Turkey.  He had to support himself and get a job.   He  explained  that
    from 2004 to 2011 he was organising parties, working as a DJ and  doing
    stall jobs.  He had cheap rents or  shared  accommodation.   He  stayed
    here not just because he enjoyed it but because he could not face going
    back.  When arrested in  Scotland  he  had  given  his  girlfriend  C's
    address as he did not have an address in London.  He had claimed asylum
    after he was arrested.  His big fear was of having to go into the army.
     He had deferred his service before coming to  the  UK.   When  he  had
    finished his degree he would get another year before having to  do  his
    military service.  He had graduated in December 2000 and  has  provided
    his deferment document to the British  Embassy.   He  had  returned  to
    Turkey in 2002 and 2003.  He referred to the letter at A17 and 18.   He
    had been asked to get a copy of this and he had done so from  a  friend
    who worked in the army.  He could not get any letters from his  parents
    as they would not send them.  His sister would not involve  herself  in
    this.  This document set out his ID number.  He did not  think  he  had
    ever received an identity document but when in Turkey  he  had  had  an
    identity document and passport but they would have had the  old  serial
    numbers.  If he had to do military service he would either  do  six  or
    twelve months.  He confirmed that there  were  exemptions  obtained  by
    payment.  If he had worked in this country legally he could  pay  about
    10,000 Euros.  He  had  looked  into  this  to  consider  the  options.
    However, a student visa followed by unlawful residence would  not  meet
    the requirements.

20.  The appellant explained that he  had  telephoned  the  Turkish  Embassy
    about three or four years ago to ask if he could be  exempted  and  was
    given exact information.  Having  AIDS  would  have  exempted  him  but
    living healthily with HIV would not.  He had called the enquiry line at
    the Embassy and had been put through to an expert on the military side.
     He had also researched this on the internet and confirmed  that  being
    HIV positive would not affect his military  service.   So  far  as  the
    exemption for being gay was concerned he had been looking at this for a
    very long time since his last years at university.  He had  to  make  a
    choice of doing military service or finding a way out.  There would  be
    a risk of bullying in the army and he feared he would be  singled  out.
    Initially he said he was not  prepared  to  go  through  the  exemption
    process but otherwise he would be bullied and may have to  do  it.   He
    would go through some humiliation and would rather  do  this.   He  had
    been researching this from a very young age.  The authorities  required
    physical evidence and it was his view that it was  outrageous  that  by
    drawing a picture someone could be judged as gay or not.

21.  He had had relationships with both men  and  women  and  was  bisexual.
    Things could happen which could identify him and he did not want to  go
    through the risk of what might happen.  It was out of the question that
    his sister would be prepared to speak up for him during  the  exemption
    process.  She would not go through that humiliation.  She did not think
    that being gay was an option but that there was  something  wrong  with
    him that he needed to change.

22.  In re-examination he accepted that his sister  had  helped  a  lot  and
    tried to be supportive but when he tried to  speak  to  her  about  the
    option of speaking up for him in the exemption process, she was  silent
    and uncomfortable and refused to hear what he was saying.  He knew  the
    consequences of not speaking up  for  himself,  but  his  family  would
    rather he went in the army and proved himself to be normal.  She  would
    never go and talk to anyone about his sexuality.  This was  because  of
    the society she lived in.  He explained that the reason he  obtained  a
    new identity number had come from the fact  that  he  had  been  online
    trying to find out his pension and tax payments arising  from  when  he
    had worked in Turkey.  He had read an  article  about  making  payments
    from outside Turkey and then made enquiries.  He had been asked for his
    identity number and had put through the old details and they  had  come
    up with his contributions and found his number.  He  had  worked  part-
    time for two and a half years when at university and then  also  for  a
    private airline.  These enquiries had been made  about  three  or  four
    years ago.

(ii) Evidence of IK

23.  IK's statement is at 1A 30-1.  He is a Danish national who was born  in
    Turkey but has been living in the UK since 1997.  He described  himself
    as a self-employed mentor and personal development coach  for  business
    owners.  He is gay and involved in the LGBT scene organising single gay
    men's  drinks  and  dinners  in  various  restaurants  in  London.   He
    confirmed that he first met the appellant when he attended one of these
    drinks and dinner evenings last year, about six or  seven  months  ago,
    spoke at length and then met after the dinner.   They  were  close  for
    three or four months but as he was busy with work  and  family  issues,
    they started to see each other less often and  he  realised  that  they
    would not be suited to each other.  Their relationship ended  in  terms
    of not seeing each other but they have continued to meet and  sometimes
    spend the night together.  The appellant had not  told  him  about  his
    immigration issues  until  two  months  ago.   He  confirmed  that  the
    appellant was bisexual and not lying about this issue.

24.  In his oral evidence he confirmed that his statement was true and  that
    he and  the  appellant  still  met  occasionally.   The  appellant  was
    bisexual but he (IK) wanted to be with someone who was not bisexual  as
    he was looking for a long term partner.

(iii)    Evidence of BA

25.  BA's  witness  statement  appears  at  1A  22-24.   He  has  known  the
    appellant since 2007 after meeting in a club.  This was a regular event
    and they kept seeing each  other  at  similar  events.   They  kept  in
    contact and they  told  each  other  about  their  sexuality.   He  was
    bisexual like the appellant.  They had never had an actual relationship
    apart from being friends but  had  spoken  about  their  problems.   He
    confirmed that the appellant was bisexual and he knew that he  had  had
    male partners in the UK.

26.  In his oral evidence he said that on many occasions  he  had  seen  the
    appellant with someone whom he believed  was  a  male  sexual  partner.
    They  would  talk  about  who  they  were  seeing   and   about   their
    relationships generally.  When he had seen him with male partners,  the
    appellant had been happy, calm and relaxed and was not hiding anything,
    being open about the  relationship.   The  appellant  had  been  a  lot
    happier in 2007.  He could be himself and he went out and  had  a  good
    time.  He saw him about once a week or maybe every couple of weeks.

27.  In cross-examination he said the appellant had not spoken to him  about
    military service as there was not much to speak about, although he  was
    very scared of being ill-treated or worse as the military were not very
    tolerant of homosexuality.  He had not been in the military himself: he
    was from Cyprus.  He liked to go to Turkey.  Many Turkish people set up
    business in this country because it was a different way of  life.   The
    appellant feared that there was not much toleration of homosexuality in
    Turkey and those were things that you could not do.

(iv) Evidence of CD

28.  The evidence of CD is in her  witness  statement  at  1A  19-21.   This
    witness did not give oral evidence before us.  She is a British citizen
    who met the appellant in around 2010 when they were introduced  through
    some mutual friends.  A few months later they started  to  have  casual
    sex with each other but neither wished to  enter  into  a  relationship
    beyond that.  She had already been told that he was bisexual  and  this
    made no difference to her.  They continued to see each other for casual
    sex.  She felt more attracted to him and wanted to  be  his  girlfriend
    but that was not the type of relationship he wanted  and  she  accepted
    this.  She had been with the appellant at a hotel in Inverness when  he
    was arrested on 26 October 2011.  She had gone to Scotland  because  at
    that time he had been living there with  some  of  his  friends.   They
    decided to book  a  hotel  room  but  having  spent  the  day  together
    drinking, they began to argue, the appellant raised his voice, she also
    started shouting and someone from the hotel must have called the police
    and he was arrested.  CD did not attend  the  hearing  even  though  Mr
    Gilbert had indicated that it had been his intention  to  call  her  to
    give oral evidence.

The Expert Evidence

(i)  The Evidence of Ulrike B�hnish

29.  Ms B�hnish's witness statement is at 2A 25-30.  Although  not  tendered
    as an expert witness, we have included her evidence in this section  as
    she gives evidence about the situation for non-heterosexual men  facing
    military service in Turkey.  She is a director  and  producer  and  has
    produced  "��r�k  -  the  Pink  Report",  her  first   feature   length
    documentary.  She spent a year in Turkey  on  this  project  and  three
    years researching it.  She interviewed two people, who were  successful
    in  obtaining  exemption  from  military  service  and  appear  in  the
    documentary, and met three others who were each exempted  but  she  did
    not interview them specifically for the documentary.  She did not  meet
    anyone who had applied for exemption but failed.  She  interviewed  one
    person who decided to do his  military  service  and  hide  his  sexual
    orientation.  She also met ten people who hid their sexual  orientation
    during their period of service but  did  not  interview  them  for  the
    documentary and one person who "outed" himself during military service.
     She had found it very difficult to meet people  who  were  willing  to
    talk to her about this.  She had a link with  someone  described  as  a
    well known and trusted member of the Ankara "queer scene"  and  he  put
    her in touch with people to interview.  She had not  paid  any  of  the
    people she had met because as a film maker she did not want  people  to
    participate in projects for financial gain.  They  were  all  consulted
    before the documentary was published and a Turkish and a German  lawyer
    viewed it before publication.  It started as a university  project  but
    later she spent a year collecting small amounts of  funding  from  LGBT
    organisations in Germany.

30.  Most of the men she spoke to told her that they  tried  to  hide  their
    homosexuality during military service.  This was not an  easy  decision
    for them as it was like fighting against  themselves  and  could  cause
    serious psychological trauma and conflicts of  conscience.   For  those
    who managed to hide their homosexuality until the end  of  their  duty,
    military service remained a painful memory for them.  The fear  of  the
    consequences of being discovered was a constant factor.  Their  biggest
    fear seemed to be that their sexuality would not be compatible with the
    general hetero-normative and masculine environment.  They  also  feared
    sexual harassment by their commanding officers.

31.  One former soldier told her that he  was  moved  into  a  special  unit
    where he shared a small room with ten people  instead  of  fifty.   She
    commented that whether this was a way the officer was trying to protect
    him or to discriminate  against  him  by  segregation  was  subject  to
    interpretation, but the officer had told him that homosexuality was bad
    behaviour and that he should change  his  beliefs.   Homosexuality  was
    still considered a psycho-sexual  disorder  by  the  Turkish  military.
    Homosexuals were considered to be sick and  were  not  allowed  into  a
    military school.  Most of the gay men she  met  who  were  in  military
    service  suffered  from  discrimination   because   of   their   sexual
    orientation.

32.  She then dealt with the issue of how  homosexuality  is  understood  in
    Turkish society.  It is generally  associated  with  the  idea  of  the
    passive part in sexual intercourse; homosexuals are  seen  as  feminine
    men who have passive anal sex.  The active partner on the other hand is
    considered especially virile and "twice a man" for having active sexual
    intercourse with another man.  It is considered a proof of masculinity.



33.  She said that a man  outing  himself  in  his  military  service  could
    easily become the subject of different kinds  of  discrimination  which
    could include sexual abuse and violence.  She had not met any  bisexual
    men who had served in military service but would say that if the  man's
    behaviour did not conform with the image  of  masculinity  existing  in
    promoting military service, regardless of whether he was homosexual  or
    bisexual, that could cause discrimination.  She added that  if  such  a
    person was to live the homosexual part of their sexual orientation in a
    hidden/secret way with the heteronormative life  on  the  outside,  the
    person might not be perceived as bisexual, but men engaging  in  active
    homosexual  intercourse  were  not   considered   bisexual   but   100%
    heterosexual. Only the passive  partners  were  considered  homosexual,
    even if they might be bi-sexuals. She said that  bisexuals  who  gather
    with the LGBT community are socially seen as gay.

34.  Her  researches  revealed  that  the  means  of  proof  employed  by  a
    psychologist in charge of military exemption could be quite  different.
    In some cases a person was asked to draw a house as this was considered
    a psychological method of diagnosis.  Depending on the results of  such
    tests other evidence may be asked for: photographs and sometimes videos
    of passive intercourse or anal examination.  The methods  used  by  the
    military psychological departments were not  written  in  any  official
    publication and could vary depending on the person in charge.

35.  After her documentary was completed, she got  feedback  from  many  gay
    men that they had had a similar experience to those  described  in  the
    documentary.  It was her view that outing yourself in  the  TAF  during
    military service could lead  to  serious  discrimination,  even  sexual
    violence.  The behaviour shown from  military  hospitals  revealed  not
    only homophobia but also a serious danger for homosexual  men  as  they
    were completely exposed to the will of the  doctor.   She  observed  in
    Turkish society a deep homophobia that led  to  discrimination  in  its
    different forms.  It was her view that the humiliation incurred  during
    the exemption process was a proof of chicanery and the fact  that  many
    men preferred to get  humiliated  in  that  extreme  way  in  front  of
    military psychologists instead of going into  military  service  itself
    shed a light on the possible dangers a non-heterosexual man could  face
    during his service.

36.  In her oral evidence she explained that there were several reasons  why
    people did not wish to appear in her  documentary.   Some  were  afraid
    because of the lack of freedom of speech in Turkey and did not want  to
    speak out on military issues.  Others feared being recognised by family
    members.  The  whole  subject  of  military  exemption  was  incredibly
    intimate and it was hard to speak out in public.  The interviewees  did
    not demonstrate loyalty to the military as an institution  but  to  the
    meaning of the military  in  Turkish  society.   It  was  an  important
    institution and to speak against the military was to speak against  the
    nation and the flag.  Those who had been  successful  in  hiding  their
    sexuality had not suffered.   There  was  a  fear  of  harassment  from
    commanding officers.  She confirmed that  only  the  passive  male  was
    considered to  be  homosexual  and  indeed  that  it  was  seen  as  an
    honourable activity to be the active  partner.   Fear  arose  from  the
    position of domination, in the military there would be no way of saying
    no and there was no other exit.

37.  In cross-examination she said that the report issued when  someone  was
    exempted on the basis of their sexual identity was known as the  rotten
    report.  She did not know if exemption for other  medical  reasons  was
    issued on the same report.  One of the purposes of her documentary  was
    because she wanted to make people understand how afraid someone had  to
    be voluntarily to go through the humiliating process of exemption.  The
    basic fear was of military service and the point she was trying to make
    was how bad the second option  (military  service)  had  to  be  to  go
    through the process of applying for exemption.  She was asked  what  it
    was that had to be hidden in the context of army service,  particularly
    if there was nothing to suggest that someone was passively gay  or  not
    obviously effeminate.  She said that sexual identity still  had  to  be
    hidden.  There was a general conception of what was normal.  If someone
    said they were gay, even if they said they took the active  role,  from
    the moment the word was used there would be stigmatising with the  risk
    of verbal discrimination, special duties and at worst rape.

38.  On the process of  exemption,  she  did  hear  about  cases  where  the
    military authorities had taken the initiative and had referred  someone
    to the psychiatrist.  So far as the procedure was concerned, people did
    disagree with  it  but  were  afraid  to  bring  the  matter  up.   Her
    documentary had been the first on this subject and it was her view that
    a Turkish citizen would not have been allowed to make it.  Her film had
    not been shown publicly in Turkey but only at small festivals.

39.  She had seen about three or four copies of a  Pink  Report.   A  person
    would regard this as an intimate document and it would not be the first
    thing to be shown.  She was not aware  of  anyone  obtaining  exemption
    when they were not homosexual, i.e.  a  successful  false  claim  by  a
    heterosexual.  She imagined that could exist as there was no  right  to
    conscientious objection in Turkey and she could  envisage  some  people
    might try to claim exemption by pretending to be gay.  The  basic  fear
    was a simple human fear of  bad  things  happening  because  of  sexual
    orientation and being  in  a  helpless  position  and  getting  abused,
    discriminated against or persecuted.

(ii) The Evidence of Dr Ozgur �inar

40.  Dr �inar's report appears at 2A, 1-24.  His CV is set out  at  2A,  25-
    30.   This  sets  out  his  academic   background,   his   professional
    qualifications, his employment background and his publications.  He  is
    a Turkish lawyer who has also worked as a legal expert for the  Council
    of Europe since 2008.  He received his PhD from the University of Essex
    in September 2012 on the subject of conscientious objection.  He  is  a
    senior associate at St Anthony's College, Oxford, working on freedom of
    thought, conscience, religion and expression in Turkey.

41.  He confirms the obligation for  Turkish  males  to  undertake  military
    service, set out in article 72 of the 1982 Constitution that:

          "National service is the right and duty of every Turk.  The manner
         in  which  this  service  shall  be  performed,  or  considered  as
         performed, either in the armed forces  or  in  the  public  service
         shall be regulated by law".


     There is no alternative civilian service.  The  specific  law  relating
    to military service is the Military Service Act 1927 -  No  1111  which
    provides that: "Every male Turkish citizen is obliged  to  perform  his
    military service in accordance with this law".

42.  When a man reaches the age of  20  he  is  liable  to  recruitment  but
    military service can be postponed in a number of situations, either for
    medical reasons or to study.  The appellant in  his  witness  statement
    had explained how he deferred his military  service,  firstly  for  his
    higher education and then he renewed his extension because of  studying
    abroad  and  so  followed  the  correct  procedures.   There   was   no
    recognition yet of conscientious objection as a right and  no  form  of
    any alternative service.  Conscientious objectors faced  "civil  death"
    and were suspended in a vicious circle  of  incarceration,  prison  and
    military barracks and once leaving they are surrounded by a militarised
    society.  The issue was addressed by the European Court of Human Rights
    (ECtHR) in the case of Ulke v  Turkey  (39437/98)  January  2006.   The
    Court found the  position  of  the  applicant  in  that  appeal  to  be
    degrading and a violation  of  article  3  because  of  the  cumulative
    effects of repeated criminal convictions and the  constant  alternation
    between prosecutions  in  terms  of  imprisonment,  together  with  the
    possibility of prosecution for continuing  failure  to  carry  out  his
    military service.

43.  The qualifying ages for military services are between 20 and 41 but  in
    practice there is no upper age limit  for  recruitment.   In  Tastan  v
    Turkey (63748/00), the ECtHR had found a violation  against  Turkey  in
    the case of the applicant who was ordered to perform  military  service
    at the age of 71.  Conscientious objectors, draft evaders and deserters
    were not accepted  as  good  citizens  and  military  conscription  was
    regarded as the first step on the path to  manhood  and  the  essential
    condition of manliness.   His  report  explains  the  punishment  under
    Turkish law  for  refusal  to  join  the  Turkish  armed  forces  under
    conscription and the relevant  legal  provisions.   There  are  several
    reasons  for  exemption  from  military   service   such   as   health,
    psychosexual  diseases  (namely   homosexuality,   transsexualism   and
    transvestism) or disability.  When a man declares he does not  want  to
    join the military as he is a homosexual he first  needs  to  visit  his
    doctor or a doctor at a civilian or  military  hospital.   He  is  then
    referred to the military hospital because he has to  prove  his  sexual
    orientation to a doctors' committee in a  military  hospital  and  this
    committee is authorised to issue an unfit report for military  service.



44.  He describes this as a long and harsh procedure.  The applicant has  to
    show an advanced sexual behaviour disorder which  is  "explicitly  seen
    and diffused all over his life".  He has to prove his homosexuality  in
    several  ways  such  as  by  a  personality  test,  Minnesota  Multiple
    Personality Inventory, incomplete sentence test, by  videos  or  photos
    taken during sexual intercourse with a  partner  or  photos  or  videos
    taken  while  wearing  women's  clothes  in   public   places,   rectal
    examination, proof from a relative  and  hospital  stay  in  the  "pink
    ward".  If the doctors still cannot reach a decision in  the  light  of
    the various examination methods a gay  candidate  will  be  temporarily
    exempted for a year after which  he  has  to  return  to  the  military
    hospital to undergo the same procedure again.

45.  The armed forces do challenge the sexual orientation  of  recruits  who
    identify themselves as gay.  He  refers  to  a  2005  study  of  Lampba
    Istanbul  which  covered  399  gay  (including  bisexual)   individuals
    exploring the unfit report issue. Out of the 27 gay males who agreed to
    talk, six were rejected after their first interview at the conscription
    centre  and  were  not  sent  to  military  hospital.  Out  of  the  21
    individuals sent to the hospital six said they had  submitted  pictures
    taken during sexual intercourse and 13 that they had  undergone  rectal
    examinations. Seven individuals were denied a  report  for  "not  being
    effeminate enough". Sometimes it was not  possible  to  gain  an  unfit
    report in spite of providing all the evidence requested.  Dr �inar then
    refers to an article in the Milliyet newspaper about AA, a  homosexual,
    who did not receive an unfit  report  despite  pictures  and  a  rectal
    examination because he was found to be "not effeminate enough".   Later
    he appealed to the Military High Administrative Court  which  found  in
    his favour on the ground of "suspicions about his being  homosexual  in
    the military  would  cause  unavoidable  problems".   If  the  military
    authorities are satisfied that someone is gay they issue a "report"  to
    the  person  stating  he  is  unfit  for  military  service.   This  is
    informally called a pink card and sets out  the  individual's  personal
    details, the diagnosis, the findings explaining why the person  is  gay
    and the doctor's signatures.

46.  So  far  as  gay  recruits  not  exempted  from  military  service  are
    concerned, he refers to an Amnesty International report of 2011  saying
    that they were subjected to threats and abuse from commanding  officers
    and from fellow conscripts and in some instances to homophobic violence
    by conscripts.  Gay men also said that they feared or  were  threatened
    with rape or other forms  of  sexual  violence  by  fellow  conscripts.
    There is provision under the military penal code that if  such  actions
    are conducted by commanders  they  would  be  brought  before  military
    courts and may face  imprisonment,  but  the  issue  is  whether  these
    measures are effective or not in  practice.   He  refers  to  a  report
    "Violations of the Rights of Conscripts in  Turkey"  published  by  the
    Rights of Conscripts Initiative stating  that  "ill-treatment,  torture
    and systematised abuse have  remained  part  of  military  culture  for
    decades without notable improvement".

47.  If an exemption is issued the decision is  automatically  sent  to  the
    local authorities and in a village or  small  town  this  may  lead  to
    details of sexual orientation being made public, putting him at risk of
    homophobic abuse or violence.  Similar problems may be faced in  a  big
    city.  If someone applies for a job he would  be  asked  to  provide  a
    certificate indicating he had completed military service.  Even  though
    the grounds are not stated  on  the  certificate  there  was  a  common
    suspicion that it was granted on grounds of sexual orientation and this
    can lead to employers refusing a job.

48.  Dr �inar refers to  the  recent  European  Union  Report,  2012  Annual
    Progress Report for Turkey for the  accession  to  the  European  Union
    noting that the internal rules of the Turkish armed forces continue  to
    define  homosexuality  as  a  psychosexual  illness  and   to   declare
    homosexuals unfit for military service.  The same  report  also  states
    that homosexuality is not a criminal offence but LGBT  people  continue
    to suffer discrimination,  intimidation  and  are  victims  of  violent
    crime.  He explains that this arises from the concept of honour and the
    value attributed in Turkey society to masculinity, the  position  being
    compounded by homophobic statements from state officials to the  effect
    that homosexuality is a biological disorder, an illness that should  be
    treated.

49.  In his oral evidence Dr �inar gave further details about the  exemption
    certificate.  When asked whether gay recruits were subject to  physical
    or  psychological  harm,  he  referred  to  the  Rights  of  Conscripts
    Initiative October 2012, describing  this  as  the  most  detailed  and
    intensive report.  There was also a risk of punishment  in  Turkey  for
    criticising the army in the light of para  318  of  the  Turkish  penal
    code.  He referred to the "Do Ask, Must Tell" report of December  2010,
    saying this was one of the first reports  setting  out  the  complaints
    about what could happen during military service and  raised  issues  of
    ill-treatment.  More attention was now being paid to these issues.

50.  In cross-examination Dr �inar confirmed that so far  as  he  was  aware
    the copies he had seen of the Pink Reports were of  genuine  documents.
    The names, titles and language used were correct.  He had practised for
    two and a half years as a lawyer in Istanbul and during  that  time  he
    had had a couple of clients who were draft evaders.  He was still  part
    of a legal firm in Turkey  and  if  any  issues  of  draft  evasion  or
    conscientious objection arose, he would be consulted.  When  doing  his
    PhD he had done research  on  homosexuality  but  was  advised  not  to
    include it.  He explained that there had been an amnesty in Turkey last
    year providing for payment of 30,000 Turkish  lira  to  gain  exemption
    from military service.  If a man was outside Turkey, had  lived  abroad
    and worked lawfully for three years he could pay 10,000 Euros.  He  had
    obtained exemption on this basis.

51.  He confirmed that only a military  hospital  can  issue  the  exemption
    report.  If someone claimed an exemption on the basis of being gay,  he
    went to a doctor and then would be referred  to  a  military  hospital.
    Everything  was  under  the  control  of  the  Ministry   of   Defence.
    Homosexuality was not now referred to as a psychosexual disorder but as
    sexual identity and behaviour.  If someone was asked for pictures  they
    would have to show them.  None of the methods used were compulsory  but
    failure to comply could lead to failing to establish an exemption.   If
    an exemption was claimed and refused there would not be  a  punishment.
    The tests started with the personality test and then moved on to  other
    tests such as rectal examination, asking for pictures or for  testimony
    from a family member.  Sometimes the applicant  was  required  to  stay
    overnight in hospital or in a cell so that he could be observed.

52.  Dr �inar said that he had been invited to  give  training  to  military
    judges in Turkey on behalf of the Council of Europe.  This included the
    most senior fifty judges and he  felt  that  most  of  them  had  great
    difficulty understanding gay issues.  He accepted  that  small  changes
    were taking  place  in  Turkey  as  it  was  attempting  to  obtain  EU
    membership, but there was a huge gap between theory and implementation.
     After someone had been exempted and had applied for employment, it was
    not compulsory to show the certificate but some employers would ask for
    it.  Job applications usually asked whether military service  had  been
    completed.  Employers were anxious that someone would not be called for
    service after being offered employment.  He confirmed  that  there  had
    been an instance of attempts to rectify  discrimination  by  sending  a
    warning letter to employers.  In 2010 legislation had  been  introduced
    to permit individual applications on human rights  grounds  in  Turkish
    courts, but he was not aware of any such application and in  any  event
    it would be a long process, although this did  represent  an  important
    change.

(iii)    The Evidence of Mr J Irlenk�user

53.  Mr Irlenk�user's evidence is set out in an expert report entitled  "The
    Situation for Homosexuals in the Turkish Armed Forces" dated  May  2013
    at 2A 31-60.  His CV at 61-62.  The bundle also includes  his  master's
    thesis, "The Rotten Report - Gender Identities in the Turkish Military"
    at 2A 63-149.  His report is written from the perspective  of  cultural
    and social anthropology.  He  is  currently  a  PhD  candidate  at  the
    European University Viadrina in Frankfurt (Oder), Germany.  He works in
    the same university as the  coordinator  of  the  European  studies  MA
    programme.  As part of his master's thesis he carried out  research  on
    military service in Germany from April 2011 to May 2012 and within this
    framework conducted interviews with twelve men and one  woman  on  this
    issue.  Since October 2012 he has continued his  research  on  military
    service in Germany and conducted thirteen further interviews.

54.  His report is generally consistent with the  evidence  set  out  in  Dr
    �inar's report.  It is not in issue that military service is  mandatory
    for all male citizens of Turkey and there is no alternative service  or
    provision for  conscientious  objection.   Military  service  liability
    starts at 20 and continues to 41 but that age only refers to  the  fact
    that anyone who has performed his service remains a reservist until the
    age has been reached.  As for starting military service, no  age  limit
    exists and there are cases of people in their older age being asked  to
    perform their  service.   Turkish  nationals  permanently  and  legally
    residing abroad can apply every second year for deferment until the age
    of 39.  Those who have worked abroad for at least three  years  holding
    valid work and residence permits have the opportunity of being exempted
    by paying  10,000  Euros,  the  so-called  "foreign  currency  military
    service".  Under certain preconditions it is also possible  to  qualify
    for exemption  if  military  service  has  been  completed  in  another
    country.

55.  The only ground for ineligibility for military service is for  distinct
    health issues based on the  Turkish  Armed  Forces  Health  Regulation,
    which sets out a variety of disorders and  diseases  including  "sexual
    identity disorder".  Gay people can be excluded from  military  service
    as they are regarded  both  as  a  threat  to  military  order  and  as
    disabled/disordered people.  They  are  exempted  by  military  doctors
    during military health examinations.  Asking recruits to identify their
    sexual orientation is not a usual part of recruitment  and  examination
    procedures but recruits can be referred to the  psychiatric  department
    to have their sexual orientation determined if  there  is  a  suspicion
    that they suffer from a  "sexual  identity  disorder"  or  the  recruit
    demands to see a psychiatrist.

56.  There is no provision which per se excludes gay  people  from  military
    service but two reasons for exclusion exist: to  get  exempted  on  the
    basis of the TAF Health Regulation or the Forces Disciplinary  Law  for
    being involved in unnatural behaviour.  The usual reason for a gay  man
    to be excluded was to be considered ineligible due to  diagnosis  of  a
    "psychosexual disorder" in respect of advanced sexual  disorders  which
    were "explicitly apparent in the person's whole life" which could cause
    "objectionable situations in the  military  environment".   In  January
    2013 there was a major amendment to the TAF Health Regulation replacing
    "sexual disorders" by "sexual identity and behavioural disorders".  But
    just as in the old regulation  the  "sexual  identity  and  behavioural
    patterns should  be  dominant  and  apparent  in  every  part  of  [the
    recruit's] life".

57.  Mr Irlenk�user then  sets  out  the  procedures  adopted  to  determine
    whether a recruit should be exempted on this basis.  The  military  has
    developed a range  of  diagnostic  methods  to  determine  and  measure
    someone's sexuality. These comprise:  a  personality  test,  photos  or
    videos taken during sexual intercourse, photos or  videos  taken  while
    wearing women's clothes in public places, the "relative/forced come-out
    proof", rectal examination and hospital stay.  The aim of these methods
    is to determine whether the recruit is  "really"  homo-/bi-/transsexual
    in the sense that the "disorder" is "dominant  and  apparent  in  every
    part of his life".  The decision whether a recruit is really considered
    to be homosexual so qualifying for exemption is based on three factors:
    his outer appearance (female characteristics  like  no/few  body  hair,
    breasts, female clothing), his behaviour (facial expressions, gestures,
    voice intonation) and his personal characteristics (among others to  be
    the passive/receiving party  during  sexual  intercourse).   After  the
    various tests had been carried out, the medical estimate is made  by  a
    military  medical  committee,  usually  comprising  ten  high   ranking
    military doctors.  If a recruit is asked to provide a  video  or  photo
    material, the committee is also in charge of evaluating this  evidence.
    His report then describes the procedure in stages: first stage,  health
    examination, second stage, consulting a  psychiatrist/psychologist  and
    personality tests, the third stage,  being  asked  to  provide  further
    material,  being  asked  to  bring  a  close  relative  to  testify  to
    homosexuality,  rectal  examination,  hospital  stay,   fourth   stage,
    questioning by the military doctors' council and fifth  stage,  meeting
    with the military doctors' committee.

58.  His report says that the TAF does not challenge the sexual  orientation
    of the recruit but might challenge the demand to  be  exempted  on  the
    grounds of his sexual  orientation.   It  is  not  usually  the  sexual
    orientation itself which is questioned but  the  fact  of  whether  the
    recruit is considered to be a "real homosexual" or just a  person  with
    unusual sexual preferences.  The perception  of  homosexuality  is  not
    reduced to a person's sexual orientation but refers to a person's whole
    personality including his outward appearance  and  behaviour.   Medical
    staff at a military hospital might believe a  recruit  to  be  sexually
    drawn towards other men but may still consider  him  as  too  manly  to
    qualify as a "real homosexual" and therefore refuse his  demand  to  be
    exempted from military service.  He says that  if  a  gay  asks  to  be
    exempted from military  service  due  to  sexual  orientation  and  the
    psychiatrist at the military hospital, after  a  personal  consultation
    and some personality tests cannot reach a final diagnosis, the  recruit
    might be asked to provide proof of his sexuality or further examination
    methods might be carried out.  When  asked  whether  gay  recruits  are
    required to undertake special physical examination he said that as part
    of the exemption procedure they  can  be  asked  to  undergo  a  rectal
    examination but according to his research this practice had become much
    less common after  it  had  appeared  in  various  international  media
    outlets and been recorded  in  the  2011  European  commission  "Turkey
    progress report". Studies prepared  on  the  issue  in  2006  and  2007
    mentioned cases in which  recruits  had  to  undergo  this  examination
    method but none of Mr Irlenk�user's interviewees (post June  2011)  had
    had to do so. It was now more and more common for recruits to be  asked
    to bring a close relative to the military hospital and  in  many  cases
    proof from a close relative had  become  a  necessary  precondition  in
    order to obtain exemption. It  had  become  almost  impossible  to  get
    exemption from recruits who were not "out" with their families.  He was
    asked to comment on what would happen  if  a  gay  recruit  refused  to
    provide evidence of his sexuality  and  his  view  was  that  in  these
    circumstances the most likely consequence is  that  he  would  not  get
    exempted.  If recruits choose not  to  produce  evidence  the  military
    doctors will refuse to diagnose him as suffering from a sexual identity
    disorder.

59.  He confirms that in Turkey there is  no  legal  discrimination  against
    LGBT people but equally they are  not  specifically  protected  by  any
    legislation in the sense of  anti-discrimination  rules.   There  is  a
    range of legal provisions in the form of morality based laws which  are
    commonly used to discriminate against LGBT people.   Being  a  lesbian,
    gay, bisexual or transgender person is still broadly  considered  as  a
    moral offence, often leading to discrimination  and  violence.   Within
    the closed surroundings  of  a  military  unit  this  violence  can  be
    particularly dangerous.  As military service is considered  a  rite  of
    passage into adult heterosexual masculinity, the TAF is seen as  having
    a particularly hostile atmosphere towards  anything/anybody  considered
    unmanly.  He refers to instances  of  gay  recruits  being  faced  with
    violent harassment during their military service.

60.  He says at [86]:

         "In  sum,  being  homo-/bi-/transsexual  in  the   TAF   does   not
         necessarily mean to be confronted with  violence.   But,  and  this
         obviously counts in particular for those  cases  where  the  fellow
         recruits found out about the ... person's  sexual  orientation,  it
         definitely goes hand-in-hand with a significantly  higher  risk  of
         facing various degrees of psychological or physical  violence  than
         is the case for heterosexual recruits."


    He says that depending on the situation of the individual case homo-/bi-
    /transsexual recruits  face  different  degrees  of  psychological  and
    physical violence. However, what most probably counts for all  recruits
    who did not "fit the norm" with regards to their sexuality, it  is  the
    constant fear that their sexual  orientation  is  discovered  by  their
    fellow recruits and the consequences this might have for their personal
    security.  Discovery could lead to verbal abuse, threats of  or  actual
    physical violence.  He was asked if the TAF have effective measures  to
    prevent such harm and referred to the provisions of the military  penal
    code providing for punishment.  It is his view that the  TAF  does  not
    seem to be able to protect gay recruits from possible harm  they  might
    experience through their sexual orientation.

61.  It is his view that many gay men decide not to  get  exempted  as  they
    fear that their family will find out about  their  sexual  orientation.
    If exemption is granted, military duty is considered as fulfilled.  The
    pink report is issued by the  authorities  as  proof  that  someone  is
    exempted and sets out the military doctor's final diagnosis.

62.  Mr Irlenk�user says that during the last ten years the  issue  of  gays
    in the TAF has  attracted  increasing  public  attention,  particularly
    after the issue got picked up by various media outlets from  Turkey  as
    well as from abroad.  While the issue has been addressed by  the  media
    and a  broad  range  of  human  rights  organisations,  government  and
    military officials have tended not to comment on it.  If a man  applies
    for employment his employer will  expect  him  to  prove  that  he  has
    completed his military service.  The main reason is that employers want
    to exclude the danger of an employee  being  conscripted  in  the  near
    future.  As military service can  only  be  postponed  for  educational
    reasons, it is very likely a man who has  not  completed  his  military
    service will not be able to stay in a job position  for  a  long  time.
    Any recruit who is not exempt from  military  service  who  refuses  to
    serve is liable to punishment as a draft evader.  If a recruit asks  to
    be exempt on grounds of sexual orientation but refuses to provide proof
    of his sexuality it is likely  at  best  that  the  exemption  will  be
    refused.  As the appellant has failed to report for  service  for  more
    than a year, his potential penalty under the military code would  be  a
    prison sentence of between four months and two years if he  reports  or
    between six months and three years if he is arrested, and he would most
    likely be imprisoned in a military  prison.   Those  perceived  as  gay
    within a military prison regime face a danger  of  being  subjected  to
    torture, inhumane or degrading treatment both from prison  inmates  and
    the prison staff.  He refers to a report relating to the treatment of a
    conscientious objector Mehmet Tarhan but says it  is  not  quite  clear
    from these  reports  whether  he  was  abused  because  of  his  sexual
    orientation or because of his approach towards military service.

63.  In his oral evidence Mr Irlenk�user confirmed that his research was  as
    a cultural anthropologist.  He worked at the Istanbul office of Amnesty
    International on a project collecting data  for  a  database  on  human
    rights  organisations  which   he   confirmed   were   mainly   Turkish
    organisations but covered some NGOs.  He  felt  there  was  still  very
    little evidence about gays in the military.  The matter had been raised
    essentially for the first time in the newspaper article  of  2006.   He
    confirmed that  in  Turkish  culture  generally  it  was  not  seen  as
    problematic to have sex with another man as the  active  party.   There
    would be pressure on gays from men to have sex with  them  and  in  the
    closed environment of the military there would be no escape.

64.  In cross-examination he said that his  interest  in  this  subject  had
    developed during his exchange semester from October 2010 to April 2011.
     He had later gone back to conduct interviews.  There had been  limited
    sources of information but he had been able  to  obtain  evidence  from
    academics and in particular  from  a  retired  academic  who  had  been
    aggressively critical on the whole  issue.   He  accepted  that  a  gay
    person might well feel the whole process of exemption  was  humiliating
    but would not want to lose that process.  If someone was living in fear
    of what would happen during fifteen months' military service  it  would
    be better to undertake the humiliating process of  obtaining  exemption
    and then the matter was over.  He confirmed that there were other  ways
    of obtaining exemption, working and residing legally abroad  for  three
    years.  The previous provision was the payment of 5,100 Euros and doing
    three weeks' basic training but this had now been  replaced  by  paying
    10,000 Euros and undertaking  no  service.   As  far  as  he  knew  the
    appellant would not be  able  to  take  advantage  of  that  provision.
    Service could be deferred as a student but not beyond the  age  of  38.
    If someone was studying abroad and failed to report to service  at  38,
    they would lose their passport and this could lead to  the  loss  of  a
    valid residence permit abroad.

65.  There has been discussion within Turkey about alternative  service  for
    a number of years.  The process for identifying whether someone  should
    have a military exemption  has  been  developed  by  military  doctors.
    During the past six years there had been criticisms of the  methods  of
    diagnosis.  Different doctors might apply different tests.  He was  not
    aware of any case where a potential recruit had not  had  to  undertake
    the personality test.  It could be that someone was signed  off  simply
    on that basis but he did not think that that  was  the  case.   Of  the
    people he interviewed all eight had been exempted.  Only two  or  three
    underwent the personality test, the other  five  had  to  submit  to  a
    rectal examination.  The background was simply that  the  military  did
    not want homosexuals  in  the  armed  forces  for  fear  of  disturbing
    military discipline.  They sought  to  determine  whether  someone  was
    completely homosexual, passive or  effeminate.   Some  recruits  feared
    applying for an exemption because they did not want the risk of  family
    rejection.  He accepted that evidence from family members was  becoming
    a more important way of proving homosexuality.  Recruits were  not  now
    asked on a regular basis to provide photographs.  If someone  had  been
    exempted on this basis, it would not be possible to  obtain  employment
    in the public sector, although he did not  know  whether  this  was  by
    legal provision.  One person he had interviewed had said he was so  gay
    that he would only work for a gay friendly company and there were  such
    companies.  He confirmed that the amnesty referred to by Dr  �inar  (at
    [50] above) in Turkey had run for six months  but  there  was  no  such
    provision currently in place. If someone was studying abroad he thought
    that the individual would inform the  authorities  as  opposed  to  the
    position in Turkey when the university did so.

Submissions

66.  On behalf of the respondent Mr Hayes submitted  that  the  first  issue
    was to consider whether the appellant was bisexual or would be  treated
    as gay by the authorities in Turkey.  The  respondent  doubted  whether
    this was the case.  The appellant's credibility was undermined  by  the
    delay in claiming  asylum,  particularly  in  circumstances  where  his
    sexuality formed a core part  of  the  claim.   He  said  he  had  been
    diagnosed with HIV but he had never sought treatment and had  continued
    his life in the UK.  It had now been  accepted  that  he  was  not  HIV
    positive.  This raised real doubts as to whether  his  sexual  identity
    was at the heart of his claim or whether this was a case  of  a  simple
    unwillingness to undertake military  service.   The  second  issue  was
    whether the appellant would seek exemption from military service on the
    grounds of his sexuality.  He asserted that he would, regarding this as
    the lesser of two evils.  Assuming that he was bisexual  and  therefore
    prima face falling within a category entitled to exemption, the  policy
    and process applied in Turkey would not generally fall within article 3
    or 8, although on a case-by-case basis an individual might be  able  to
    substantiate such a claim.

67.  He submitted that there was nothing in  the  appellant's  circumstances
    which would compel him to  seek  an  exemption.   His  situation  could
    properly be distinguished from that of a homosexual.   As  a  bisexual,
    potentially  at  least  he  shared  aspects  of  the  identity   of   a
    heterosexual.  There was no real issue about the  process  of  applying
    for exemption or the techniques used to discover whether the  exemption
    criteria applied.   The  aim  was  to  protect  military  "health"  and
    discipline and to prevent heterosexuals dishonestly seeking exemptions.
     There was evidence of the techniques used but  no  figures  about  the
    total exemptions claimed, the basis or the process gone  through.   The
    use of photographic evidence appeared to be a  technique  developed  by
    doctors, not by the military as such.  The situation was different from
    the processes employed to "out" the parties as in the  ECtHR  in  Smith
    and Grady v UK (33985/96 and 33986/96).  He argued  that  it  could  be
    inferred from the evidence that there may in some  circumstances  be  a
    minimum process leading to an acceptance that an applicant fell  within
    the category granted exemption, but in other cases there  may  be  more
    enquiries.  He accepted that there was  evidence  that  being  exempted
    from military service as a "gay" could lead to discrimination  but  the
    evidence failed to establish generally or in the present case that  the
    high article 3 threshold would be met.

68.  He accepted that acts of persecution and  reasons  for  it  could  take
    different forms but they must be linked: see articles 9 and 10  of  the
    Qualification  Directive.   The  evidence  as  a  whole  did  not  show
    widespread or systematic discrimination or that there was  a  risk  for
    gay/LGBT individuals generally.  There were  a  number  of  gay  rights
    organisations and non-governmental  organisations  in  Turkey  offering
    advice and  support.   Organisations  such  as  Social  Policy,  Gender
    Identity and Sexual Orientation Studies Association ("SPoD"), and  Kaos
    Gay and Lesbian Cultural Research and  Solidarity  Organisation  ("Kaos
    GL"), both  national  non-governmental  LGBT  organisations  in  Turkey
    provide HIV/AIDS consultancy and both agreed that there was a gay scene
    in Turkey, particularly in urban areas in Istanbul, Ankara,  Eskisehir,
    Izmir, Antalya and coastal areas such as Marmaris and Bodrum and  there
    were many gay networks in Turkey and on the  internet.   The  situation
    could properly be distinguished from the position in the  East  African
    Asian case (1981) 3 EHRR 76

69.  Conscientious objection was not  recognised  as  an  exemption  and  in
    Sepet and Bulbul v SSHD [2003] UKHL 15, the House of Lords  established
    that there was no  internationally  recognised  right  of  absolute  or
    partial conscientious objection such that where it was not respected  a
    good case for  refugee  status  was  established.   In  any  event  the
    background evidence now showed that the military  courts  had  shown  a
    willingness to implement ECHR  judgments,  although  he  accepted  that
    there were isolated incidents of prosecutions that breached article  3.
    He submitted that if not exempted or an exemption was not applied  for,
    there was no sufficient evidence to show that the  appellant  would  be
    targeted as a gay person or suffer any worse treatment.  He referred to
    HJ (Iran) [2010] v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  [2010]
    UKSC 31.  The question of whether the appellant could be expected to be
    discreet about his sexual identity had to be looked at in  the  context
    of military service, which was for a limited period of  time.   It  was
    not unreasonable  in  these  circumstances  for  the  appellant  to  be
    discreet about or to hide that aspect of his sexual identity.

70.  Mr Gilbert submitted that the appellant had established that he  was  a
    bisexual.  He had called two witnesses  to  support  his  own  evidence
    about his sexual identity.  If he had to return to Turkey he would have
    to hide  this  to  avoid  persecution.   The  appellant  could  not  be
    expected, assuming he was not exempted,  to  dissemble  about  his  own
    identity even for six months.  The issue had to be  looked  at  against
    the background of the situation in  Turkey  and  in  particular  during
    military service.  Heterosexual recruits  would  not  be  in  the  same
    position of having to repress an important aspect of their  personality
    or hide the outward appearance of who they were.  The general  attitude
    of people in  Turkey  towards  those  who  were  not  heterosexual  was
    evidenced by the report at  R29  about  the  position  of  LGBT  asylum
    seekers in Turkey from Iran.  They had been the  subject  of  violently
    homophobic treatment.  He submitted that the background and the  expert
    evidence identified something seriously  concerning  in  the  exemption
    process and in the prospect of military service for those identified as
    gays.  There  was  clear  evidence  of  ill-treatment  in  the  Turkish
    military which appeared to be condoned.

71.  The exemption process and the procedures employed involved a series  of
    measures of such  severity  that  the  article  3  threshold  was  met.
    Potential conscripts might voluntarily undertake the exemption  process
    but this was  only  because  the  alternatives  were  even  worse.   An
    applicant would be labelled, categorised and denigrated as a result  of
    his sexuality.  This led to discrimination and being  treated  as  very
    much a second or even third class citizen.  The  Turkish  military  was
    not the direct cause  but  must  understand  what  the  situation  was.
    Someone  going  through   this   process   suffered   degradation   and
    stigmatisation for the rest of  their  life.   He  submitted  that  the
    appellant as a bi-sexual had good reason  to  be  fearful  of  military
    service as a result of his sexual identity.  There was a real  risk  if
    he was outed of being subject to not only abuse but also  ill-treatment
    and rape.  If a conscript  was  identified  as  "ibne",  (an  intensely
    abusive term for a gay man), he would  be  unable  to  engage  in  full
    service with sufficient protection from  the  authorities.   There  was
    evidence of endemic bullying within a homophobic military.

72.  The fears held within the gay community in Turkey  about  the  risk  of
    homophobic ill-treatment during military service were confirmed  by  Ms
    B�hnish and the expert evidence.  In summary,  he  submitted  that  the
    appellant as a bisexual male would be faced with a situation of  either
    having to apply for exemption  or  undertake  military  service  in  an
    atmosphere in which certain categories of gay  were  not  permitted  to
    serve.  An open or identified bisexual man would be  at  real  risk  of
    treatment in  breach  of  article  3  and  there  would  be  inadequate
    protection to  obviate  the  risk  of  harm.   He  submitted  that  the
    appellant was entitled to asylum on the basis that the  risk  would  be
    for a Convention reason as bisexual conscripts would form a  particular
    social group.  He further submitted that even if the appellant's  claim
    failed  on  asylum  and  article  3  grounds  that  in  his  particular
    circumstances to remove him would be in breach of article  8.   He  was
    now estranged from his family but maintained limited contact  with  his
    sister.  As an openly bisexual man present in the UK for  twelve  years
    he  had  established  private  life  rights  and   removal   would   be
    disproportionate.

The Law

73.  The appellant is entitled to asylum if, owing to  a  well-founded  fear
    of being persecuted for a Convention reason he is outside  his  country
    of nationality and is unable or, owing to such risk, unwilling to avail
    himself of the protection of that country.  He must show that there  is
    a reasonable degree of likelihood or a real risk that this is the case.
     We must also take  into  account  the  Qualification  Directive  given
    effect in The Refugee or Person in  Need  of  International  Protection
    (Qualification) Regulations 2006 and in particular reg 5.

     It is provided by reg 5(1) that in  deciding  whether  a  person  is  a
    refugee an act of persecution must be:


         "(a)     sufficiently serious by its nature  or  repetition  as  to
             constitute a severe violation  of  a  basic  human  right,  in
             particular a right from which derogation cannot be made  under
             Article 15 of the  Convention  for  the  Protection  of  Human
             Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; or


         (b)  an accumulation of various measures, including a violation  of
             a human right which is sufficiently severe  as  to  affect  an
             individual in a similar manner as specified in (a)."


     Reg 5(2) provides that an act of persecution may take the form of:

         "(a) an act of physical or mental violence,  including  an  act  of
             sexual violence;


         (b)  a legal, administrative, police or judicial measure  which  in
             itself  is  discriminatory  or  which  is  implemented  in   a
             discriminatory manner;


         (c)   prosecution  or  punishment  which  is  disproportionate   or
             discriminatory;


         (d)  denial of judicial redress resulting in a disproportionate  or
             discriminatory punishment;


         (e)  prosecution or punishment  for  refusal  to  perform  military
             service in a conflict, where performing military service would
             include crimes or acts falling under regulation 7."

74.  On the issue of military service we are bound by the  opinions  of  the
    House of Lords in Sepet and Bulbul v Secretary of State [2003] UKHL  15
    where it was held that  there  was  no  established  international  law
    providing for a right of conscientious objection to  military  service.
    It was accepted that a state may require compulsory military service of
    its nationals and prosecution and punishment arising from such  refusal
    does not amount  to  persecution  unless  some  additional  element  is
    identified and proved to establish persecution.

75.  We remind ourselves of the guidance in HJ (Iran).  In [22],  Lord  Hope
    said that a carefully nuanced approach was called for to  separate  out
    those who were truly in need of surrogate  protection  from  those  who
    were not.  His guidance on the approach to be followed is  set  out  at
    [35(a)-(e)].  The first stage is to consider whether  an  appellant  is
    indeed gay and the next stage to assess what his situation will  be  on
    return.  The question was how the appellant,  looked  at  individually,
    would conduct himself if returned and how others would react to what he
    did.  He must  not  be  expected  to  conceal  aspects  of  his  sexual
    orientation which he was unwilling to conceal, even from those he  knew
    may disapprove of it.  If he feared persecution as a  result  and  that
    fear  was  well-founded,  he  would  be  entitled  to  asylum   however
    unreasonable his refusal to resort  to  concealment  may  be,  and  the
    question of what was reasonably tolerable had no part in that  enquiry.



76.  In [35(c)] Lord Hope said that the fact  the  appellant  would  not  be
    able to do in his country of nationality everything that  he  could  do
    openly in the country where he sought protection was not the test.  The
    Convention was not directed to reforming the level  of  rights  in  the
    country of origin, and it would be wrong to approach the issue  on  the
    basis that its purpose was to guarantee that an appellant who  was  gay
    could live as freely and openly as a gay person would be able to do  so
    if he was not returned.  In [35(d)] he said that if it was  found  that
    the appellant would in fact conceal aspects of his  sexual  orientation
    on return, the next stage would be to consider why he would do so.   If
    this was simply a response to social pressures  his  claim  for  asylum
    must be rejected, but if the reason he resorted to concealment was that
    he genuinely feared that otherwise he would be persecuted, it would  be
    necessary to consider whether that fear was well-founded.

77.  We must also consider the provisions of article 3  of  the  ECHR  which
    state that:

         "No one shall be subjected to torture or to  inhuman  or  degrading
         treatment or punishment."


    Ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to  fall
    within the scope of article 3.  The assessment of this  minimum  is  in
    the nature of things relative and depends on all the  circumstances  of
    the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical or mental
    effects and in some cases the sex, age  and  state  of  health  of  the
    victim etc.

     We have been referred to the decision of the ECtHR in Pretty  v  United
    Kingdom [2002] 35 EHRR 1 and in particular [52] which says that:

         "Where the treatment humiliates or debases an individual showing  a
         lack of respect for, or diminishing, his or her  human  dignity  or
         arouses  feelings  or  fear,  anguish  or  inferiority  capable  of
         breaking an individual's moral and physical resistance, it  may  be
         characterised as degrading and also fall within the prohibition  of
         article 3."


     We also accept that the determination of whether  treatment  is  severe
    enough to violate article 3  requires  all  matters  to  be  considered
    cumulatively.  In a similar vein we have  been  referred  to  Ocalan  v
    Turkey [2005] 41 EHRR  45  where  at  [181]  the  court  said  that  in
    considering whether a punishment or treatment is "degrading" within the
    meaning of article 3, the court will have regard to whether its  object
    is to humiliate and debase the person concerned and whether, as far  as
    the  consequence  is  concerned,  it  adversely  affected  his  or  her
    personality in a manner incompatible with article  3.   No  submissions
    were made on MR (Risk-homosexual) CG [2002] UKIAT 05654 but  that  case
    very much turned on its own facts and in any event in the light of  the
    evidence now available cannot now  be  regarded  as  providing  country
    guidance.

78.  We have been referred to the judgment of the ECtHR in Smith  and  Grady
    v UK which dealt with complaints that the actions of the UK  government
    in investigating whether serving  members  of  the  armed  forces  were
    homosexual and their consequential discharge constituted violations  of
    the Convention.  When considering the applicable general principles  at
    [87]-[89] the Court confirmed that the  right  to  respect  for  sexual
    identity concerned a most intimate part of an individual's private life
    and that there  must  exist  particularly  serious  reasons  before  an
    interference can justify the requirements of article  8.   However,  an
    interference would be considered necessary in a democratic society  and
    for a legitimate aim if it answered a  pressing  social  need  and  was
    proportionate to the aim pursued.  The Court recognised that it was for
    the national authorities to make the initial assessment  of  necessity,
    although the final evaluation as to whether the reasons cited  for  the
    interference were relevant and sufficient was one  for  the  Court.   A
    margin of appreciation was left to contracting states in the context of
    this assessment which varied according to the nature of the  activities
    restricted and the aims pursued by those restrictions.

79.  The Court held that where the core of a national security  aim  pursued
    was the operational effectiveness of its armed forces, each  state  was
    competent to organise its own system of military discipline and enjoyed
    a margin of appreciation in this respect.  It was open to the State  to
    impose restrictions on an individual's right to respect for his private
    life where there was a real threat to  the  armed  forces'  operational
    effectiveness  as  the  proper  functioning  of  an  army  was   hardly
    imaginable without legal rules designed to  prevent  service  personnel
    from undermining it.  However, national authorities could not  rely  on
    such rules to frustrate the exercise by individual members of the armed
    forces of their right to respect for their private lives,  which  right
    applied  to  service  personnel  as  it  did  to  others   within   the
    jurisdiction of the state.

80.  So far as sufficiency of protection is concerned we have been  referred
    to Horvath v Secretary of State [2009] Imm  AR  205  and  to  Svazas  v
    Secretary of State [2002] EWCA Civ  74  and  to  the  need  for  cogent
    evidence that a state is willing and able to offer effective protection
    against abuses by its own agents.  The appellant also seeks to rely  on
    article 8 and in this context we have been  referred  to  a  number  of
    authorities and in particular we take into account the guidance of  the
    House of Lords in Razgar v Secretary of State [2004] UKHL 27 and  Huang
    v Secretary of State [2007] UKHL 11.


Background Evidence

81.  We have been provided with substantial  background  evidence  in  three
    bundles.  This evidence supports in broad  terms  the  expert  evidence
    about the position of LGBT individuals in  Turkey.   In  the  US  State
    Department Human Rights Report 2012 at  3/4A  1-48  under  the  heading
    "Societal Abuses, Discrimination, and Acts of Violence Based on  Sexual
    Orientation and Gender Identity" it is recorded that:

         "LGBT individuals continue to suffer  discrimination,  intimidation
         and violent crimes.  LGBT groups claim that the police  harass  and
         arbitrarily  arrested  transgender  individuals  during  the  year.
         Human  rights  organisations   reported   many   prosecutions   for
         'offending public morals'.  Authorities will often use the  law  on
         misdemeanours to impose fines on transgender persons when they have
         frequented stores or walked on city streets.  Police  claimed  they
         were acting on  complaints  they  had  received.   Transgender  NGO
         representatives reported they were subjected to violence  but  that
         there was no place where they could make a complaint or  press  for
         their rights.  They allege that police insulted and swore  at  them
         while doctors ridiculed them. ...  Police  provided  protection  to
         some 'pride' events in  Istanbul  and  other  cities.   During  the
         Istanbul trans pride parade in June, an  extremist  group  attacked
         marchers; riot police broke up the altercation.   In  the  Istanbul
         pride parade in July, no instances of violence were reported.


         There were active LGBT organisations in  Istanbul,  Ankara,  Izmir,
         Adana, Eskisehir, and Diyarbakir and unofficial groups  in  smaller
         cities and on university campuses. Groups  reported  harassment  by
         police and government authorities. Many university groups in  small
         cities complained that they had tried to organize, but  the  rector
         denied permission. LGBT organizations reported that the  government
         used regular and detailed auditing to create administration burdens
         and threaten the possibility of large fines."


82.  On the issue of gays in military service the report says:

         "Authorities did not allow  openly  gay  men  to  perform  military
         service for 'health reasons' due to their sexual orientation.   Gay
         men requesting military exemption for reasons of sexual orientation
         had to undergo an invasive burden of proof, but authorities  denied
         such requests many times,  even  after  the  men  proclaimed  their
         sexual orientation  and  underwent  treatment  and  examination  at
         several military medical facilities.  LGBT groups  complained  that
         gay men were required to show photos or  videos  of  themselves  in
         overtly  sexual  positions  and   to   undergo   thorough   medical
         evaluations to prove their  homosexuality  to  military  officials.
         The groups further complained that military officials  'outed'  gay
         men to their families and communities."

83.  There  is  clear  evidence  of  hostility  and  discrimination  against
    members of the LGBT community and we note in particular  the  reporting
    of a letter in the Council of Europe of 26 April 2012 from  members  of
    the Parliamentary  Assembly  expressing  concern  about  the  degrading
    treatment applied to gays and transwomen by excluding them from service
    in the Turkish armed forces [3A108] and an article "Do Ask, Must  Tell"
    of  4  December  2010  asserting  that  the  military  does  not   just
    discriminate against gays in Turkey but humiliates them [3A77-79].   We
    have also taken into account the Amnesty report "Not an Illness  Nor  a
    Crime" 2011 and in particular the part dealing  with  gay  men  in  the
    military at [3A141-143].

84.  We also take into account the fact that the evidence shows  that  there
    is an increasing interest in and awareness of LGBT issues.  We note  in
    particular that Kaos GL published a military service brochure  for  gay
    people in January 2011 3A at 54-65.  This  referred  to  the  fact  the
    Supreme Court in Turkey has found discrimination on the basis of sexual
    orientation to be contrary to law and has reached a  verdict  on  these
    lines [3A60].  There has also been a report on the violations of rights
    of conscripts in Turkey [3A83-105], the Askerhaklari executive  summary
    of October 2012.  We also take into account [R 31] the Turkey Gay Guide
    which identifies that there is  a  liberal  and  lively  gay  scene  in
    Istanbul, but we contrast with this the article at R  tab  32  from  e-
    International Relations describing government  hostility  towards  LGBT
    individuals in an article headed LGBT rights in Turkey: the  Long  Road
    to Tolerance.  We are satisfied that some  steps  are  being  made  but
    there are still many steps to take.

85.  We must also  take  into  account  that  the  Turkish  authorities  are
    beginning to respond to ECtHR judgments and to the requirements of  the
    European Union in the light of Turkey's application for membership.  In
    the European Commission Turkey 2012 Progress Report (R tab  10)  it  is
    recorded that overall some progress has been made on the observance  of
    international human rights law, but important  reforms  are  needed  to
    strengthen  human  rights  structures  and  the  number   of   criminal
    proceedings brought against human  rights  defenders  is  a  matter  of
    concern.  On the issue  of  anti-discrimination  legislation,  although
    homosexuality is not a criminal offence in Turkey, it is reported  that
    LGBT people continue to suffer discrimination,  intimidation  and  were
    the victims of violent crime.  High profile public  figures  repeatedly
    used negative stereotyping against LGBT persons and the internal  rules
    of the Turkish  armed  forces  continued  to  define  homosexual  as  a
    "psychosexual illness" and  declared  homosexuals  unfit  for  military
    service.  We note that there has been a change in form in this  respect
    but the report says that substantial government efforts are  needed  to
    effectively protect vulnerable groups including LGBT  individuals  from
    societal abuse, discrimination and violence.

Conclusions on the expert and background evidence.

86.  We turn now to our assessment of the expert and background evidence  on
    the issues of military service in Turkey and the circumstances in which
    an exemption may be granted because  of  sexual  identity.   There  are
    consistent strands running through the expert evidence  we  have  heard
    and the  background  evidence.   The  evidence  of  Mr  Irlenk�user  is
    substantially based on the work he  carried  out  researching  military
    service as part of his MA programme and he is currently a PhD candidate
    at  the  European  University  in  Frankfurt  (Oder).   Although  still
    pursuing his academic qualifications, it  is  clear  that  he  has  had
    direct experience of working in Turkey and has acquired a  considerable
    knowledge of military service and the circumstances in which exemptions
    can be granted.  The bibliography, journal articles and  other  sources
    set out at the end of his Master's thesis taken with his thesis and his
    expert report satisfy us that he can be properly regarded as an  expert
    on this particular issue.  He gave his evidence  in  an  objective  and
    dispassionate way and we found his evidence reliable.

87.  His evidence  is  consistent  with  the  evidence  of  Dr  �inar  whose
    expertise  on  this  subject  is  evidenced  by   his   education   and
    professional qualifications at the  end  of  his  report.   Dr  �inar's
    evidence appeared less objective than that of Mr  Irlenk�user  in  that
    what he had to say is imbued with  his own strong views on  the  issues
    of military service in Turkey and in particular the lack of  any  right
    to conscientious objection and the procedure  for  determining  whether
    exemption will be granted because of sexual identity.  He is a  Turkish
    citizen and had no wish to undergo military service as evidenced by the
    fact, as he accepted, that  he  was  able  to  take  advantage  of  the
    "foreign currency military service" option.  The  evident  strength  of
    his views, whilst leading us to  take  a  cautious  approach,  did  not
    detract from our assessment of him as a reliable witness.

88.  We have not treated the evidence  of  Ms  B�hnish  as  expert  evidence
    although clearly she acquired knowledge about the issues before  us  in
    the context of preparing her documentary.  We have borne in  mind  that
    the requirements of editing and selection  in  order  to  make  a  film
    documentary inevitably  shape  the  way  the  topic  being  covered  is
    presented.  Even so, her evidence  is  generally  consistent  with  and
    confirms that of Dr �inar and Mr Irlenk�user.

89.  Subject to the above qualifications, we  therefore  see  no  reason  to
    reject any of the expert and additional  evidence  by  these  witnesses
    from which, together with the  related  country  information,  we  draw
    these conclusions. It is  not  in  dispute  that  military  service  is
    mandatory for all male citizens of Turkey and there is in  practice  no
    provision for alternative service for grounds of conscience.  Liability
    for military service starts at 20 and continues to 41 but that age only
    relates to those who have performed their military service remaining  a
    reservist.  Deferment can be obtained for the purpose  of  studies  and
    Turkish nationals permanently legally residing abroad can  apply  every
    second year for a deferment until the age of 39.

90.  Those who have worked abroad for at least  three  years  holding  valid
    work and residence permits have the opportunity of  being  exempted  by
    paying E10,000, the so called foreign currency military service.  It is
    also possible to qualify for exemption if  military  service  has  been
    completed in another country.  There was a  period  when  an  exemption
    could be purchased within Turkey on payment of a lump sum.

91.  The army in Turkey plays an important role  in  society.   It  is  some
    600,000 persons strong, of whom some 80% are conscripted.  All  Turkish
    males (there is no conscription for  women)  are  required  to  undergo
    military service, although deferment is possible for those in education
    either within Turkey or studying abroad.  Legitimate employment  abroad
    may also result in deferment.  If someone does not  wish  to  undertake
    military service (which is normally six to twelve months for those  who
    have received tertiary education and  up  to  fifteen  months  for  all
    others), it is possible if there is an amnesty scheme in play whereby a
    substantial sum is paid and service reduced to three  weeks.  Otherwise
    the only ground for exemption is on the grounds of physical  or  mental
    disability and we are concerned with  what  is  now  described  in  the
    relevant regulations as a "sexual identity disorder".

92.   Dr  �inar  in  his  evidence  identified   these   as   homosexuality,
    transsexualism and transvestism. Mr  Irlenk�user  described  them  more
    generally as advanced sexual  disorders  "explicitly  apparent  in  the
    person's whole life". He said that  recruits  would  not  generally  be
    asked to identify their sexual orientation but they could  be  referred
    to a psychiatric department to have  their  orientation  determined  if
    there was suspicion that they suffered from  such  a  disorder  or  the
    recruit initiated the process by demanding to see  a  psychiatrist.  Ms
    Bohnisch confirmed in her evidence that she had heard  of  cases  where
    the military authorities had taken the initiative and made the referral
    but normally it is the recruit who seeks exemption.

93.  When he does so, he needs  to  visit  his  doctor  or  a  doctor  at  a
    civilian or military hospital  and  is  then  referred  to  a  military
    hospital to prove his sexual orientation to a  doctors'  committee.   A
    number of procedures have been adopted to determine whether  a  recruit
    should exempted.  These include a personality test, the  production  of
    explicit videos or photos of sexual activity or wearing women's clothes
    in public places, a medical examination, a hospital stay in the  "pink"
    ward and confirmation of sexuality  from  a  relative.   This  will  be
    followed by questioning by a military doctors' council and meeting with
    the military doctors' committee.  Which  procedures  are  used  in  any
    given case are in the discretion of the relevant doctors  and  military
    personnel.  Some people are granted exemption after  the  psychological
    test and interview whereas others have  to  provide  further  evidence.
    The further evidence now most commonly required  is  confirmation  from
    family members and we accept in the light of Mr Irlenk�user's  evidence
    that the requirements of personal explicit photographs and of a  rectal
    examination are now generally not imposed.

94.  There was agreement between the experts and Ms B�hnish on the issue  of
    how homosexuality is understood in Turkish society.   It  is  generally
    associated with the passive role in sexual relations, which is seen  as
    unmanly.  As Mr Irlenk�user put  it,  it  is  not  usually  the  sexual
    orientation itself which is  questioned  but  whether  the  recruit  is
    considered to be a "real homosexual" or  just  a  person  with  unusual
    sexual preferences.  The perception of homosexuality is not reduced  to
    a person's sexual preference but is informed by the  whole  personality
    including his outward appearance and behaviour.  As Dr �inar  describes
    it, an applicant has to show  an  advanced  sexual  behaviour  disorder
    which is "explicit and seen and diffused all over his life".

95.  Therefore, if a man  takes  (or  is  believed  to  take  based  on  his
    appearance and demeanour) a passive role, this is seen as  unmanly  and
    is disapproved of.  A male taking the active role does not attract  the
    same disapproval and it is not  considered  that  this  undermines  the
    essence of his manliness.

96.  Before considering the risk  during  military  service  we  will  first
    consider the exemption process.  The prohibition on  gay  men  or  more
    accurately a particular category of gay men serving in the Turkish army
    is  not  easy  to  reconcile  with  international  human  rights  norms
    particularly in the light of the decision by the  ECtHR  in  Smith  and
    Grady v UK nor is the categorisation of particular sexual identities as
    disorders.  However, the policy of excluding those perceived as  having
    a  sexual  identity  disorder  from  military  service  has  not   been
    challenged in these proceedings nor has it been argued  that  having  a
    process  of  exemption  in  itself  falls  within  article  3   or   is
    persecutory. The prohibition is regarded by the Turkish authorities  as
    a necessary  restriction  with  a  view  to  ensuring  the  operational
    effectiveness of the Turkish armed forces. As Mr Irlenk�user put it  in
    cross-examination, a gay person might well feel that the whole  process
    of exemption was humiliating  but  he  would  not  want  to  lose  that
    process.

97.  The exemption process is a therefore a route to exemption available  to
    those who fall within the category of having a sexual identity disorder
    as understood in Turkish society.  It was Mr Gilbert's submission  that
    the exemption process and the procedures employed involved a series  of
    measures of such severity that the article 3 threshold was met  whereas
    Mr Hayes argued that  the  process  would  not  generally  fall  within
    article 3 or 8 although on a case-by-case basis an individual might  be
    able to substantiate such a claim.

98.  The evidence we have considered has satisfied  us  that  the  exemption
    process is generally contrary to article 3.  Dr �inar  described  as  a
    long and harsh procedure. He accepted that the methods  used  were  not
    compulsory but failure to  comply  could  lead  to  failing  to  obtain
    exemption. Mr Irlenk�user has given a full account  of  the  procedures
    saying that the aim of the methods is to determine whether the  recruit
    is "really" homo-/bi-transsexual in the sense that  the  "disorder"  is
    "dominant and apparent in every part of his  life".   The  process  can
    include  the authorities resorting to intrusive  requirements  such  as
    carrying out a  rectal  examination  or  requiring  the  production  of
    explicit photographs or evidence of  dressing  in  female  clothes  and
    there is evidence that those exempted have been stigmatised as "rotten"
    by failing to meet society's expectation of how a man should be.

99.  A requirement to  undertake  an  assessment  by  a  psychiatrist  or  a
    personality test may not without more be a breach of article 3  and  it
    may well be that a man perceived to fit the  Turkish  stereotype  of  a
    homosexual will be able to obtain exemption without having  to  produce
    photographs or undertake a rectal examination, and in this  context  we
    have already noted Mr Irlenk�user's evidence  that  these  requirements
    are now less likely to be imposed.  The more usual requirement  is  for
    the authorities to require confirmation  of  sexuality  from  a  family
    member but this in itself may for some men be intrusive and  demeaning.
    There is no standard  procedure  followed  and  the  requirements  will
    depend upon the particular psychiatrist  or  military  doctors  and  in
    these circumstances it is not possible to exclude the  real  likelihood
    that someone seeking exemption  will  be  subjected  to  intrusive  and
    humiliating procedures.

100. We find that  there  is  an  increasing  awareness  in  Turkey  of  the
    requirements of human rights obligations  and  an  increasing  interest
    generally in such issues in the context of military service,  and  this
    has meant that there has been some improvement in the way the exemption
    process is carried out. Nonetheless, the  US  State  Department  report
    2012 records that gay men requesting military exemption for reasons  of
    sexual orientation had to undergo an  invasive  burden  of  proof,  but
    authorities denied such  requests  many  times  even  after  undergoing
    treatment and examination at a military medical facilities and in April
    2012 a letter from members of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council
    of Europe were expressing concern about the degrading treatment applied
    to gays and transwomen by excluding them from service  in  the  Turkish
    armed forces. Therefore, whilst there is evidence of  some  improvement
    it is not sufficient to satisfy us that the  exemption  procedure  does
    not involve a real risk of a breach of article 3. We are satisfied that
    the nature and extent of the process is such that it is carried out  in
    a way in which does not properly respect the human dignity  of  someone
    whose sexual identity would qualify them for exemption and can properly
    be categorised as degrading.

101  We now turn to the consequences  of  the  exemption  process.   We  are
    satisfied  that  the  process  has  the  effect  of   humiliating   and
    stigmatising someone whose exemption is accepted. It  was  argued  that
    this led to an inability to obtain employment in government service,  a
    risk of an exempted recruit's sexuality being made public in their home
    area when the decision was reported back to the local office  and  that
    exemptees were labelled with what amounted to an officially  authorised
    subordinate masculinity which marginalised this category of  homosexual
    men.

102  We have dealt with these issues  save  for  the  claimed  inability  to
    obtain employment in government service. Whilst the respondent  accepts
    in this context that  the  consequences  of  exemption  could  lead  to
    discrimination, it is argued that this does not reach the high  article
    3 threshold.  We note from the background evidence that  discrimination
    is prohibited  in  the  form  of  equal  treatment  provisions  in  the
    constitution and that an employer  is  not  entitled  to  know  details
    regarding any  military  exemption.   If  a  person  is  exempted  from
    military service because of open mannerisms or appearance, inability to
    obtain employment in the government or with conservative  employers  is
    likely to be attributable to their manner and appearance rather than to
    being exempted.  Unsatisfactory as such discrimination may be,  we  are
    not satisfied that this factor  adds  anything  to  our  assessment  of
    article 3.

103. We now turn to  the  question  of  whether  gay  men  are  at  risk  of
    persecution or serious harm during their military service.  It  is  not
    Mr Gilbert's case that all conscripts face a risk  of  article  3  ill-
    treatment.   There  is  evidence  of  bullying  and  ill-treatment   of
    conscripts, but no sufficient evidence of a  consistent  and  sustained
    pattern of behaviour to give rise to a general risk  under  article  3.
    Although there is no legal provision that per se  excludes  homosexuals
    from military service, such orientation as understood in the context of
    Turkey will lead to exemption on the basis of the Turkish Armed  Forces
    Health Regulations or the disciplinary law of involvement in  unnatural
    behaviour.  Serving as a conscript in the  Turkish  army  is  generally
    portrayed as a matter of pride and as an important part of the  passage
    to manhood or more particularly to adult heterosexual  masculinity  and
    against this background Mr Gilbert  argues  that  homosexuals  face  an
    enhanced risk by reason of their sexual orientation.

104  In the light of the evidence about how homosexuality  is  perceived  in
    Turkey, it does not follow that all homosexual  or  bisexual  men  will
    face difficulties.  On the evidence before us we are satisfied that  if
    a person is seen as a homosexual in the  sense  of  coming  within  the
    Turkish stereotype and  thus  regarded  as  having  a  sexual  identity
    disorder, if not exempted from service,  there  will  be  a  reasonable
    degree of likelihood of ill-treatment likely to be sufficient to amount
    to persecution on the basis of his sexual identity and there  would  be
    no sufficiency of protection.

105.  We  accept  that,  if  a  conscript  simply  declares  himself  to  be
    homosexual or gay, there is a risk that it will be understood by  other
    conscripts and soldiers that he takes the passive role even if that  is
    not the case although  having  regard  to  the  evidence  on  attitudes
    generally held in Turkish society, the fact that a recruit is from that
    society and the fact that the likely perception  of  sexuality  is  not
    simply by reference to a person's sexual orientation but to a  person's
    whole personality including his outward appearance  and  demeanour,  we
    consider this that it is very unlikely that someone not falling  within
    the stereotype of a homosexual would so identify  or  describe  himself
    when that was not the  case.      The  risk  of  harm  during  military
    service would therefore depend upon a number of factors, including  his
    appearance and mannerisms the way in which he  describes  any  previous
    homosexual activity; the extent to which he fits the stereotype  likely
    to be identified as a homosexual as understood within Turkish  society;
    and the extent to which he will conceal his sexual identity for reasons
    not arising from a fear of persecution.

106. When assessing these issues, as Lord Hope said in [22] of HJ (Iran),  a
    carefully nuanced approach is called for to separate out those who  are
    truly in need of surrogate protection from  those  who  are  not.   The
    working out of this nuanced approach depends upon an assessment of  the
    particular circumstances of each individual case, set in this  case  in
    the context of military service.   We  must  take  into  account  that,
    irrespective of the role someone may play in sexual intercourse, a  gay
    man who does not wish to obtain exemption because of the  process,  for
    whatever reason including the possibility of involvement of his family,
    may face abuse and humiliating treatment in the  army  if  there  is  a
    reasonable degree of likelihood that he might be regarded as a  passive
    homosexual.

107.  We follow the guidance in HJ that as a matter of general  principle  a
    person  must  not  be  expected  to  conceal  aspects  of  his   sexual
    orientation which he is unwilling to conceal, even from those he  knows
    may disapprove of it.  If, however, a  conscript  conceals  his  sexual
    identity in response to social pressures or for cultural  or  religious
    reasons of his own choosing and not because of a fear  of  persecution,
    he will not be entitled to asylum.

108. If someone conceals his sexual identity because he does  not  wish  his
    family to learn about it, he would not  be  doing  it  for  a  fear  of
    persecution  nor  would  a  conscript  who  was  responding  to  social
    pressures in society generally, which must include in  the  context  of
    Turkish society the attitude to military service,  which  by  its  very
    nature curtails many aspects of personal  behaviour  as  an  inevitable
    part of the need for military discipline, and in this context  recruits
    may well choose not to disclose their sexual identity for personal  and
    social reasons.

109. It is a question of fact in each individual case what  a  recruit  will
    do, and why.  A member of the armed  forces  will  expect  to  have  to
    exercise  a  degree  of  constraint   consistent   with   the   special
    circumstances of serving for a limited period of  time  in  the  forces
    with the need for military discipline. Such restraint would not without
    more undermine a fundamental  aspect  of  his  identity.   We  are  not
    suggesting contrary to the guidance in HJ, that there is  an  objective
    requirement for a recruit to behave reasonably save in so far as it  is
    consistent with military discipline, but simply that this is  a  factor
    to be taken into account when assessing how any  particular  individual
    will in fact behave or can be expected to behave. In cases where it  is
    found that there is  a  real  risk  of  serious  harm  arising  from  a
    recruit's sexual identity or the perception of his identity, it  cannot
    be said that the risk can be avoided or will not arise because there is
    an exemption process. As we have already found  the  exemption  process
    itself as presently carried out leads to a real likelihood  of  a  risk
    contrary to article 3.

110. We are only concerned with the  specific  issue  of  military  service.
    For the sake of completeness, on the evidence before us  we  find  that
    the general conditions in Turkey for gay men do not give rise to a real
    risk of persecution or treatment contrary to article 3.  As  identified
    in  the  background  evidence  there  are  a  number  of   gay   rights
    organisations and NGOs offering advice and assistance, and Kaos GL  not
    only provides shelter for those suffering from ill-treatment  but  also
    provides lawyers to provide legal  support  for  LGBT  individuals  and
    provides printed material and a magazine distributed in 24 cities.   It
    has also noted a degree of openness in being gay  or  LGBT  among  more
    educated people and in urban areas, and there  is  evidence  of  a  gay
    scene in Turkey particularly in urban areas, and some coastal areas.

Country Guidance

111. We summarise our country guidance as follows:

    (i)  All Turkish males are required to  undergo  military  service  but
    exemption  can  be  granted  on  the  grounds  of  physical  or  mental
    disability which includes "sexual identity disorder".


    (ii) Homosexuality is regarded by the Turkish army as a sexual identity
    disorder but the perception of homosexuality in Turkey is  not  reduced
    to a person's sexual preference but is informed by an assessment of his
    whole personality including his outward appearance and behaviour. It is
    associated with the passive role  which  is  seen  as  unmanly  whereas
    taking the active role does not attract the same disapproval and is not
    considered to undermine the essence of manliness.


    (iii)     The exemption process for determining whether  a  recruit  is
    entitled to exemption generally includes intrusive  requirements  which
    do not properly respect the  human  dignity  of  someone  whose  sexual
    identity  would  qualify  him  for  exemption  and  can   properly   be
    categorised as degrading and involving a  real  risk  of  a  breach  of
    article 3.


    (iv) If during his military service  a  recruit  (whether  he  has  not
    sought exemption or has been refused) is discovered or is perceived  to
    be homosexual as understood in Turkey, there is a reasonable degree  of
    likelihood  of  ill-treatment  of   sufficient   severity   to   amount
    persecution on the basis  of  his  sexual  identity  and  there  is  no
    sufficiency of protection. The risk of  such  discovery  or  perception
    arising during his service will require a fact sensitive analysis of an
    individual's particular  circumstances  including  his  appearance  and
    mannerisms, the way in which he  describes  his  sexual  identity,  the
    extent to which he fits the stereotype of a  homosexual  as  understood
    within Turkish society and the extent to  which  he  will  conceal  his
    sexual identity for reasons not arising from a fear of persecution.


    (v) Any such risk likely to arise during service is not negated by  the
    fact that there is an exemption process as that process itself  carries
    a real risk of a breach of article 3.


    (vi) MS (Risk- Homosexual) Turkey CG [2002] UKIAT is no  longer  to  be
    regarded as providing country guidance.


Assessment of the Appellant's evidence

112. We must now turn to  assess  the  evidence  of  the  appellant  in  the
    context of the background and expert evidence and consider  whether  he
    would be at real risk of serious harm on return to Turkey.  There are a
    number  of  aspects  in  the  appellant's  evidence   which   give   us
    considerable cause for concern such as to undermine his credibility  to
    a large extent.  He first came to the UK with a valid student  visa  in
    2001 which was renewed in 2002 and 2003, his leave to  remain  expiring
    on 31 December 2004.  When he had leave he returned to  Turkey  on  two
    occasions but did not  return  after  the  expiry  of  his  leave.   He
    remained in the UK and only came to the attention  of  the  authorities
    when he was arrested in Scotland on 26 October 2011.  At that stage  he
    did not give his full name and UKBA had no trace of him  but  he  later
    gave his correct name and said that he wanted  to  claim  asylum.   His
    failure to claim until after his arrest is a factor we must  take  into
    account as detracting from his credibility.  We are not satisfied  that
    any adequate explanation has been given for this delay.

113.     The appellant's evidence is also undermined by  the  fact  that  he
    claimed he had been diagnosed as HIV positive in  Turkey  according  to
    his screening interview  but  subsequently  said  that  this  had  been
    diagnosed in the UK.  Despite, on  his  own  account,  being  diagnosed
    after a visit to a hospital in  Chelsea,  he  did  not  seek  treatment
    saying that he had reacted very badly to the diagnosis and after  about
    four or five months went to a clinic for antidepressants  but  did  not
    use them for very long.  When  seeking  to  confirm  that  he  was  HIV
    positive, medical tests  showed  that  this  was  not  the  case.   The
    appellant described being shocked albeit in a good way  at  this  news.
    He explained this to the staff at the STD clinic and  they  thought  he
    might have another condition with  effects  similar  to  HIV.   He  was
    referred to his GP but further blood tests have shown  no  abnormality.
    We do not believe his evidence that he thought he  had  HIV.   We  have
    taken into account the evidence of Professor  Geretti  at  C201-2  that
    there was a low but not negligible likelihood of an HIV screening  test
    being reported as falsely positive but  we  do  not  believe  that  the
    appellant was falsely diagnosed.  We consider this a fiction  in  order
    to account for  the  time  he  spent  in  the  United  Kingdom  without
    satisfactory explanation for why he did not seek asylum.

114. The appellant has said that  he  has  made  enquiries  of  the  Turkish
    Embassy about postponing  his  military  service  and  generally  about
    exemptions.  He said in evidence that so far as the exemption for being
    gay was concerned, he had been looking at this for a  long  time  since
    his last years at university.  He said he had to make a choice of doing
    military service or finding a way out.  We accept  that  the  appellant
    remains liable for military service but he clearly  does  not  want  to
    undertake this and has sought ways of avoiding doing so.   He  has  not
    been able to take advantage of the foreign currency option  as  he  has
    not been legally residing abroad and  was  not  in  Turkey  during  the
    period when an internal amnesty was offered.

115. We now turn to the issue of the  appellant's  sexual  orientation.   He
    describes himself as a bisexual and although we have not accepted other
    parts of his evidence, bearing in mind the relatively low  standard  of
    proof we accept that this is the case.  He has given evidence about his
    sexual orientation and has called two witnesses one of  whom  testified
    to having a relationship with him describing him as a bisexual although
    the witness wanted to be with someone who was not bisexual  as  he  was
    looking for a long term partner.  The other witness was  a  friend  who
    said that he was bisexual like the appellant.   They  had  not  had  an
    actual relationship apart from being friends and had spoken about their
    problems.  It was his view that the appellant was bisexual  as  he  had
    had male partners in the UK.  There was also a witness  statement  from
    CD who spoke of  the  fact  that  she  had  been  in  a  casual  sexual
    relationship with the  appellant.  Although  she  did  not  attend  the
    hearing to be cross-examined about her statement, we do give it  weight
    in the light of the fact that her evidence also deals with the incident
    in Scotland leading to the appellant's arrest and  this  does  tend  to
    support her assertion that they were in a relationship.   We  therefore
    accept that the appellant has had sexual relations with  both  men  and
    women and to this extent his description  of  himself  as  bisexual  is
    accurate.

116. However, there is  no  adequate  evidence  before  us  to  support  the
    submission that the appellant would readily fall within the category of
    homosexual as perceived by the Turkish authorities or as someone with a
    sexual identity disorder entitling him to an  exemption  from  military
    service and he does not satisfy us that there is a reasonable degree of
    likelihood of him being regarded as a "real homosexual" rather than  as
    "a person with unusual sexual preferences" to use the phraseology of Mr
    Irlenk�user.  We do not consider the appellant is of an appearance  and
    presentation which is likely to lead to the suspicion that he would  be
    seen  by  other  soldiers  as  a   homosexual   within   the   cultural
    understanding in Turkey. The assertions of risk to gays  and  bisexuals
    (see for example the report of the interview with SPoD at R39) have  to
    be set in the context of the cultural perception  of  homosexuality  in
    Turkey. We do not consider that  the  appellant  will  talk  about  his
    sexual preferences in a manner that is likely  to  lead  to  him  being
    identified as a homosexual within  the  meaning  described  above.  Any
    restraint the appellant considers he needs to exercise  whilst  serving
    in the army is not unreasonable having regard to the nature of the task
    and the general behavioural constraints that can  be  expected  in  any
    military context.  We do not accept his stated intention to  return  to
    Turkey and apply for exemption from serving as a  conscript.   We  find
    that in any event he would not meet the exemption requirements and that
    he himself does not believe that he would be successful in doing so.

117. For these reasons we are not satisfied that the appellant  is  able  to
    show that he would be at real risk of persecution or treatment  falling
    within article 3 as a result of carrying out military service in Turkey
    or by reason of the process of determining whether he  is  entitled  to
    such exemption.  It has not been argued that the appellant would be  at
    risk in his particular circumstances  as  a  bisexual  on  return.   We
    consider that he would be able to lead a reasonably open life in Turkey
    having regard to the nature of his sexual identity and his evidence  of
    the situation in Istanbul and the south of Turkey  of  which  he  spoke
    favourably.  The appeal was also pursued on article 8  grounds  but  in
    the light of our findings of fact we are not satisfied  that  returning
    him to Turkey would be an interference with his right  to  respect  for
    his private and family life to engage the operation  of  article  8  or
    that removal would be  disproportionate  to  a  legitimate  aim  within
    article 8(2).

Decision

118. The First-tier Tribunal erred in law and  the  decision  has  been  set
    aside.  We re-make the decision dismissing the appeal.

119. No application has been made to vary or discharge the  anonymity  order
    made by the First-tier Tribunal and the order remains in force.

For the Appellant:     Mr A Gilbert
For the Respondent:    Ms F Saunders, Senior Presenting Officer


                           DECISION and DIRECTIONS


 1. Permission to appeal has been granted to [SD],  a  national  of  Turkey
    born November 1978 on grounds relating to the assessment by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Scott Baker of the evidence of a witness  [BA]  that  he
    knew the appellant to be bisexual and grounds relating to  the  judge's
    absence of any finding as to the consequences for a bisexual or gay man
    entering the military.  She had found the appellant was neither gay nor
    bisexual.

 2.  The  appellant's  orientation  is  acknowledged  in  the  grounds   of
    application to be the central issue in this  appeal.   The  judge  gave
    these reasons for not believing him:

      i) The appellant had arrived in the United Kingdom  as  a  student  in
         2001 and had extended his leave on this  basis  until  31  December
         2004.  Thereafter seven years lapsed without attempt to  regularise
         his position, with the appellant only  claiming  asylum  after  his
         arrest on 26 October 2011 with reference to s.8(6)  of  the  Asylum
         and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004.

     ii) The appellant had given differing dates on which he had been tested
         for and revealed to be HIV positive.  He had no proof that  he  had
         been previously positively diagnosed  and  had  produced  a  report
         dated January 2012 from Chelsea and  Westminster  Hospital  stating
         that he had neither HIV1 and 2 or  syphilis.   The  judge  did  not
         accept the appellant's  statement  that  he  had  been  erroneously
         informed of his diagnosis before,  having  given  evidence  in  the
         screening and substantive interviews of the effect of the diagnosis
         on his psyche, his depression and belief that a tumour had grown on
         his  liver  and  also  his   inability   to   commit   himself   to
         relationships.

    iii) The appellant had obtained an adjournment to enable him to  produce
         evidence he was suffering from symptoms similar to those  of  being
         HIV positive.  No evidence had been produced.

     iv) Although the appellant claimed to have had relationships with  both
         men and women in the UK based on him being bisexual, apart from the
         appellant's own assertions, the only evidence of that was from (the
         witness referred  to  above)  with  whom  he  had  not  had  sexual
         relations.  That witness's evidence was "limited".

 1. The judge went on to find the appellant had not completed his  military
    service in Turkey and will  therefore  be  wanted  as  a  result.   She
    considered however that he would be regarded as a draft evader and  not
    a deserter, and furthermore did not accept that he was a  conscientious
    objector.  With reference to GS (Article 3  -  persecution  -  military
    service) Turkey CG [2004] UKIAT 00041  she  found  that  the  appellant
    would not be at risk of persecution as a military draft evader.  In the
    light of her finding that the appellant was neither gay  nor  bisexual,
    she considered that the consequences for a bisexual or gay man entering
    military service having evaded the  draft,  had  no  relevance  to  the
    determination of the appeal.  She nevertheless  referred  to  the  most
    recent country guidance decision on that, MS (risk - homosexual) Turkey
    CG [2002] UKIAT 05654.

 2. The judge thereafter at [97] observed:

         "I note that the appellant has enjoyed a gay lifestyle  in  Turkey,
         having had a partner and attending at gay bars and that he did  not
         experience any problems at that time while in Turkey.  I note  that
         he had a job working in security at Istanbul Airport and there  was
         no evidence that  he  had  experienced  any  discrimination  whilst
         living in Turkey."

 3. The judge discounted any need  for  humanitarian  protection  and  gave
    reasons why she did not consider removal would be  disproportionate  to
    the appellant's rights under Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention.

 4. The respondent  was  unrepresented  at  the  hearing  before  the  FtT.
    According to the record of proceedings,  Mr  A  adopted  his  statement
    explaining that he had known the appellant since 2007,  giving  details
    of where they had met at a club in Old Street and explaining  that  he,
    like the appellant, is bisexual.  At [6] and [7] of  his  statement  he
    gives evidence that:

         "6.  [S] and I have never had an actual relationship together apart
             from being friends.  We have spoken to each  other  about  our
             personal problems like our relationships and sexuality.

         7.   I confirm that [S] is bi-sexual and I know  he  has  had  male
             partners in the UK."

    Mr Gilbert had not represented the appellant at the hearing before  the
    First-tier Tribunal.  Mr A was present at the  hearing  before  us  and
    instructions were taken as to the extent of his cross-examination.   We
    have noted the judge's record of proceedings which appears to  indicate
    that his statement was adopted and that  he  also  confirmed  he  is  a
    British citizen (his statement reveals that he was  born  in  the  UK).
    The next question "gay men and Mil" has unfortunately an indecipherable
    answer of which we are only able to make out "A used to go".

 5. The record reveals also that the witness answered questions  about  the
    treatment of gays in military service.  He also explained that  he  had
    been to Turkey with his family and alone.  He confirmed  also  that  in
    Islamic countries such as in North Africa men  could  be  seen  holding
    hands but not in Turkey.   There  otherwise  appear  to  have  been  no
    questions on  this  witness's  dealings  with  the  appellant  and  the
    information that they exchanged in the course of their friendship.

 6. Ms Saunders maintained the respondent's position stated in  a  response
    pursuant to rule 24 (of the procedure  rules  of  the  Upper  Tribunal)
    dated 30 May 2012 including the assertion that  corroborative  evidence
    from the witness did not oblige the judge to  find  in  favour  of  the
    appellant.  Unfortunately Ms Saunders was  hampered  by  an  incomplete
    file and she did acknowledge at first some difficulty  with  para  [97]
    which we have quoted above, although sought to resolve this by  arguing
    the judge had included these observations when dealing with  the  claim
    on a hypothetical basis.

 7. Mr Gilbert made application to amend  the  grounds  of  application  in
    three respects:

      i) Failure  to  give  any  or  any  adequate  reason  why  a  negative
         credibility finding should apply under s.8 of the 2004 Act.

     ii) Failed to give any or any adequate reasons  for  finding  that  the
         appellant was not a conscientious objector.

    iii) At [97] the judge had made a finding which  was  inconsistent  with
         her earlier conclusions on the appellant's orientation.

 8. Ms Saunders agreed for the grounds to  be  enlarged  to  include  (iii)
    above but objected to  (i)  and  (ii).   We  saw  no  justification  in
    enlarging the grounds  other  than  as  agreed  by  Ms  Saunders.   The
    appellant has been advised throughout.  There was no  response  to  the
    directions sent with the grant  of  permission.   In  any  event  there
    appeared to be little merit in either ground as:

      i) the judge  was  entitled  to  take  into  account  the  appellant's
         behaviour in claiming asylum only after arrest  which  formed  only
         part of her adverse credibility finding; and

     ii) in  the  light  of  that  adverse  credibility  finding  which  was
         otherwise open to her on the evidence, but for our concerns on  the
         evidence of Mr A, she was entitled to  disbelieve  the  appellant's
         claim to be a conscientious objector.

 9. We announced at the hearing that we were satisfied that the  judge  had
    made a material error of law in failing to give  adequate  reasons  for
    rejecting the unchallenged evidence of Mr A on  his  knowledge  of  the
    appellant's orientation.  It is not clear what was meant by  the  judge
    in referring to Mr A's evidence as "limited".  Given his account of the
    history of his relationship with the appellant, the  rejection  of  his
    evidence based on an absence of sexual relations  between  the  parties
    was not rationally open to the judge.  The  materiality  of  the  error
    requires the decision to be set aside, as if the appellant is  able  to
    establish that he is bisexual, there will need to be a consideration of
    the country evidence which identifies difficulties for those requesting
    military exemption for reasons of sexual orientation  as  well  as  the
    consequences for gay men in military service who  choose  not  to  seek
    exemption, bringing into play the principles in HJ (Iran)  [2010]  UKSC
    31.

10. We observed to the parties that the case may be  suitable  for  country
    guidance to determine whether there has been any change since MS  (risk
    - homosexual) was promulgated in 2002.   The  case  will  therefore  be
    listed for Case Management Review after which a final decision will  be
    made whether to take the case forward by way of country guidance.
13.  In summary therefore, we are satisfied  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    erred in law. None of the findings of the FtT stands except in relation
    the appellant's outstanding liability to military service in Turkey and
    his negative HIV status.  We set  aside  the  decision  which  will  be
    remade at a further hearing.
