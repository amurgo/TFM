                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is the appellants'  appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal  Judge  Parker  promulgated  27.3.15,  dismissing  the  appeal
    against the decisions of the Secretary  of  State,  dated  13.5.14,  to
    refuse their application for leave to remain  in  the  UK.   The  Judge
    heard the appeal on 12.3.15.

 2. Upper Tribunal Judge  Dean,  sitting  as  a  judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, refused permission to appeal on 29.5.15.  However,  when  the
    application was renewed to the Upper  Tribunal,  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Canavan granted permission to appeal on 28.9.15.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 31.3.16 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the decision of Judge Parker should be set aside.

 5. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Canavan found that  whilst  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge carried out  a  detailed  assessment  of  the
    family's  circumstances  with  reference  to  the  correct  authorities
    relating to the best interests of the children, it is at least arguable
    that, despite mentioning the independent social work report at �26, the
    judge "may not have given appropriate weight to findings  contained  in
    that report when he moved on to assess whether the  children  would  be
    able to adapt to life in Mauritius with  their  parents.  Although  the
    first ground of appeal is perhaps less arguable because the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge did appear to take into account the children's length of
    residence, permission is granted on all grounds because they both go to
    the issue of whether the First-tier Tribunal Judge erred in his overall
    proportionality assessment."

 6. The Rule 24 response, dated 6.10.15, submits that the  judge  correctly
    asked whether it  would  be  reasonable  for  the  children  to  go  to
    Mauritius and  has  undertaken  a  comprehensive  assessment  of  their
    circumstances between �25 and �28. It is submitted that pursuant to  EV
    (Philippines) the best interests are to be considered in the context of
    the parents having no right to be in the UK; in  this  respect,  it  is
    submitted, the judge correctly identified at �24  that  the  children's
    best interests lie in being with their parents.

 7. "It is submitted  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  appropriately
    considered: 7 years under the immigration rules in light of  Singh  and
    Khalid and the statutory definitions underpinning 117B and exhaustively
    applied the case of Azimi Moayed to the appellants' circumstances.  The
    First-tier Tribunal Judge notes at paragraph 25 that 7 years is only  a
    guide and correctly applies the reasoning of 7 years from the age of  4
    in the context of the children's wider circumstances."

 8. "It is submitted that the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  has  taken  into
    account the independent social worker's  report  at  �26,  specifically
    referencing the negative reaction of moving to  Little  Hutton.  It  is
    therefore averred that the appellants' grounds amount to no more than a
    disagreement  with  the  First-tier  Tribunal   Judge's   well-reasoned
    findings."

 9. Ms Warren submitted that the judge failed to follow  ZH  (Tanzania)  to
    make a holistic assessment of the best interests of  the  children  and
    that the highest reference to best interests is at �24 where the  judge
    states that it is in the best interests of the child to  be  with  both
    parents. She also criticised the judge's repeated reference to children
    being adaptable and asserted that none of the difficulties referred  to
    of the parents returning to Mauritius was taken  into  account  in  the
    best interests assessment, even though specifically mentioned at �14.

10. The judge correctly assumed at �16 that this is a case  where  all  the
    appellants will remain as a family and thus return as a family, with no
    separation. At �18 the judge recognised that the real issue in the case
    was the best interest of the children.  In  that  paragraph  the  judge
    addressed the difficulties the adult appellants might have in returning
    to Mauritius, including the loss of wider family support  and  that  he
    would be returned with a wife converted from Hinduism to Christianity.

11. At �26 the judge considered the difficulties the children are  said  to
    have experienced in relocating to Little Hutton,  as  contained  within
    the independent social work report. At �27 the  judge  noted  that  the
    children are aged 6, 4 and 3 and have been in the UK less than 7 years.
    The second youngest is in reception class and the youngest has not  yet
    started school. The judge correctly pointed out at �28 that 'near miss'
    is not a basis for allowing the appeal outside the Rules on  article  8
    ECHR grounds. Ms Warren submitted that 'near miss' was not relevant  to
    a best interests assessment of the children.

12. The strongest argument of the appellants is  that  the  judge  did  not
    address the best interests of the children individually. However, it is
    clear from a reading of the decision as a whole that  the  majority  of
    the discussion in the decision addresses  the  best  interests  of  the
    children. The judge has taken into account all the  material  presented
    to him, as confirmed in the decision. The judge has  taken  account  of
    everything urged upon the  Tribunal,  including  the  children's  ages,
    length of residence in the UK, the difficulty they had  in  relocating,
    and the social work report, even  though  the  expert  made  a  factual
    mistake at 4.5 in suggesting that the children would not understand the
    language and would have  difficulties  adjusting  to  the  culture.  It
    follows that the report could carry only limited weight  as  it  is  at
    least in part based on a factual matrix not accepted by the judge.

13. The judge has addressed the relevant case law and the importance of the
    7 years' residence threshold or guidance, which none  of  the  children
    met. I find the  decision  amounts  to  a  careful  assessment  of  the
    children's best interests and can see no material error by  failing  to
    address  the  best  interests  of  each  child  separately.  The  judge
    concludes, in compliance with the case law, that as  this  family  will
    either stay or return together as a family unit, the best interests  of
    each of the children is undoubtedly to remain  with  the  parents.  The
    suggestion that �24 is the only  or  highest  assessment  of  the  best
    interests of the children is not borne out by a careful reading of  the
    decision. There was no error in the judge's reference  to  their  young
    age and thus  adaptability.  The  judge  also  considered  the  alleged
    difficulties  the  adult  appellants  might  have  in   relocating   to
    Mauritius. There is no error in failing to consider the possibility  of
    divorce as the judge found as a  fact  that  the  family  would  remain
    together and at �18 was not satisfied that there would be  anything  to
    prevent the  family  integrating  on  return.  I  thus  find  that  the
    conclusion the judge reached as to the best interests of  the  children
    entirely reasoned and justified within the decision. I am not satisfied
    that any other conclusion was feasible on the facts of this case,  even
    if the judge had separately listed the  considerations  in  respect  of
    each child. In the circumstances, there is no material error of law  in
    respect of this ground of appeal.

14. Similarly, I find no error of law in the judge's treatment  of  the  7-
    year threshold. It is clear that the judge did not simply  dismiss  the
    considerations of the length of residence of the children because  none
    of them met the 7-year threshold, but rather the judge considered their
    circumstances and went on nevertheless to make a free-standing  article
    8 ECHR assessment. Whether the judge was justified in doing so  on  the
    facts of this case is far from clear, it being difficult  to  see  what
    could be considered to be compelling or  exceptional  circumstances  to
    consider article 8 private and family life outside the Rules.  However,
    in that assessment the judge was and very properly did take account  of
    section 117B of the 2002 Act, in particular  noting  at  �31  that  the
    adults built  up  their  private  life  and  had  children  when  their
    immigration status was precarious and thus should  be  accorded  little
    weight. None of the children  were  qualifying  children  either  under
    276ADE or section 117B.  The  judge  thus  concluded  that  the  public
    interest was strong. The judge was also entitled to take  into  account
    that the appellants could not meet the requirements of  the  Rules  for
    leave to remain,  which  is  the  Secretary  of  State's  proportionate
    response to private and family life rights under article 8.

15. I also find no merit in the third ground of appeal, suggesting that the
    judge  failed  to  assess  how  adaptable  the  children   would   each
    individually be to a move to Mauritius based  on  the  evidence  before
    him. This is no more than an elaboration of the previous grounds.

16. I therefore find that the grounds  of  application  for  permission  to
    appeal fail to disclose any material error. Whilst different judges are
    entitled to reach different conclusions, provided that the findings are
    based on the evidence and properly reasoned, on the facts of this case,
    I fail to see how any of the  suggested  errors  could  or  would  have
    produced any different outcome in this case. In effect, this was always
    a relatively weak claim for leave to remain  on  human  rights  grounds
    outside the Rules. Notwithstanding that the children were all  born  in
    the  UK,  the  circumstances  of  the  parents  and   children   either
    individually or collectively do not outweigh  the  public  interest  in
    maintaining  immigration  control,  which   the   judge   appropriately
    described as strong. There was no  credible  basis  for  resisting  the
    return of the family as a unit to Mauritius. Whilst each case  must  be
    decided on its own facts, the dismissal of this  appeal  was  virtually
    inevitable and I am satisfied that the conclusion reached by the  judge
    is fully justified in the cogent reasons provided.

Conclusions:

17. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal  of  each  appellant  remains  dismissed  on  all
                    grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.






Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make a no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
