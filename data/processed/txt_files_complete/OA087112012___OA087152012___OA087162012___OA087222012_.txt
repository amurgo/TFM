Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr A Rehman of Mayfair Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The Appellants are all citizens of India.  They are the wife and  three
    children of the Sponsor, Sarabjeet Singh.  They applied to join him  in
    the UK for settlement but  those  applications  were  refused  for  the
    reasons given in a Notice of Decision dated 10th  February  2012.   The
    Appellants  appealed,  and  their  appeals  were  heard  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Coutts (the Judge)  sitting  at  Hatton  Cross  on  23rd
    January 2013.  He decided to dismiss the appeals for the reasons  given
    in his Determination of the same date.  The Appellants sought leave  to
    appeal that decision, and such permission was  granted  on  24th  April
    2013.

Error of Law

 2. I must first decide if the decision of the Judge contained an error  on
    a point of law so that it should be set aside.

 3. The Judge dismissed the appeal on the grounds of maintenance only.  The
    Judge  calculated  that  to  meet  the  requirements  of  the  relevant
    Immigration Rule the Sponsor and his family required an  annual  income
    of �27,320.  Taking into  account  the  Sponsor's  employment  at  Noon
    Products Limited and Fashion Mark  (School  Wear)  Limited,  the  Judge
    further calculated that the family would have  an  income  of  �24,482.
    The Judge took into account Rajinder Kaur's prospective employment also
    at Fashion Mark (School Wear) Limited.  It  was  the  Appellants'  case
    that any shortfall in required income could be made up by savings  held
    in an Indian bank account which came from the sale of a property.   The
    Judge found that he could not take those savings into  account  because
    the documents substantiating them contained in the  Appellants'  bundle
    were not translated.

 4. At the hearing, Mr Rehman argued that the Judge had  erred  in  law  in
    coming to this  conclusion.   He  had  wrongly  calculated  the  income
    requirement and the family income.  The correct figures were as  stated
    in the grounds of application.  Mr Rehman acknowledged that there was a
    still a shortfall which in his submission   would  be  covered  by  the
    Sponsor's  savings  with  Barclays  amounting  to  �3,000  and/or   the
    Appellants' savings of about 11,000 Indian rupees. However,  Mr  Rehman
    was unable to point to any evidence of the Sponsor's savings which  was
    before the Judge, nor any translated documents showing  the  provenance
    of the Appellants' savings.

 5. In response Ms Everett was content only to say that the Judge  had  not
    erred in law.

 6. I find no material error of law so  that  the  decision  of  the  Judge
    should be set aside.  It may be the case that the  Judge  miscalculated
    both the income requirement and the  family's  income.   However,  even
    accepting that the calculation made by Mr Rehman is correct,  there  is
    still a shortfall  which  following  the  decision  in  KA  and  Others
    (Adequacy of Maintenance) Pakistan [2006] UKAIT 00065 means that  there
    is no error of law in the Judge's decision that the Appellants will not
    be able to maintain themselves and any  dependants  adequately  without
    recourse to public funds.  The Appellants therefore fail  to  meet  the
    requirements of paragraph 281(v) of HC 395.  There was no error of  law
    in the Judge's conclusion that he was not satisfied that any  shortfall
    could be covered by savings.  There was no evidence  before  the  Judge
    that the Sponsor had any savings.  It was impossible for the  Judge  to
    find  that  the  Appellants  had  credible  savings  as  the  documents
    submitted in support of that evidence were not translated.

 7. The Judge made no decision in respect  of  the  Appellants'  Article  8
    rights.  It was not argued in the  grounds  of  application  that  this
    amounted to an error of law.

Decision

 8. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law.

 9. I do not set aside the decision.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order; pursuant to Rule 45(4)(i)  of
the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005  and  I  find  no
reason to do so.
