Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mrs R Pettersen, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:    In person


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The respondent, Tariq Hussain, was born  on  13  June  1987  and  is  a
    citizen of Pakistan.  By a decision dated 28 May  2014,  the  appellant
    refused the respondent's application for further leave to remain in the
    United Kingdom on the basis of his marriage to Shabana Azam  (hereafter
    referred to  as  "the  sponsor").   I  shall  hereafter  refer  to  the
    appellant as the respondent and to the respondent as the appellant  (as
    they were respectively before the First-tier Tribunal).

 2. The appellant appealed against the decision of the Secretary  of  State
    to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  R  G  Handley)   which,   in   a
    determination promulgated on 5 August 2014, dismissed the appeal  under
    the Immigration Rules but allowed the appeal under Article 8 ECHR.  The
    respondent now appeals, with permission, to the Upper Tribunal.

 3. Both parties agreed that the appellant failed to satisfy paragraph  284
    of HC 395 (as amended) in that he had failed  to  provide  an  original
    English  language  test  certificate  from  an  English  language  test
    provider approved by  the  respondent.   In  addition,  the  respondent
    considered that the appellant was unable to satisfy the  provisions  of
    Appendix FM, R-LTRP1.1(d) because, although it was acknowledged that he
    had a genuine and subsisting relationship with the sponsor, there  were
    no insurmountable obstacles preventing the appellant and the sponsor (a
    British   citizen)   continuing   their   relationship   in   Pakistan.
    Consequently, the provisions of EX1(b) were not met.

 4. The appellant and sponsor had begun their relationship in  August  2006
    and the appellant had entered the United Kingdom on  3  February  2012.
    He had married the sponsor in Pakistan on 31 July 2010.  As regards his
    private  life,  the  appellant  accepted  that  he  did  not  meet  the
    requirements of paragraph 276ADE because he has not lived in the United
    Kingdom continuously for at least twenty years nor was he under the age
    of 18 or 25 years at the date of his application.

 5. The grounds of appeal complain that the  judge  failed  to  follow  the
    guidance of Gulshan (Article 8-new rules-correct approach) [2013]  UKUT
    640 (IAC).  The judge had failed to identify arguably good grounds  for
    granting leave to remain outside the Immigration Rules.

 6. The judge did  refer  to  Gulshan  in  the  determination  although  he
    proceeded directly from a dismissal of  the  Immigration  Rules  appeal
    [16] to a consideration [17] of Article 8 ECHR without identifying  any
    exceptional circumstances.  However, I am not satisfied (as I explained
    to the appellant and Mrs Pettersen) that the First-tier Tribunal  erred
    in law by failing to do so.  I referred Mrs Pettersen to  the  judgment
    of the Court of Appeal in MM [2014] EWCA Civ 985 at [129]:

    Sales J's decision therefore follows the logic of Laws LJ's  statements
    in [38]-[39] of AM(Ethiopia),  analysed  above.  However,  there  is  a
    difference in that in Nagre the new rules were themselves attempting to
    cover, generally, circumstances where an individual should  be  allowed
    to remain in the UK on Article 8 grounds; whereas in  AM(Ethiopia)  and
    in the present appeals the  rule  challenged  stipulates  a  particular
    requirement that has to be  fulfilled  before  the  applicant  will  be
    allowed to enter or remain. The argument in each case  is  that  it  is
    that specific requirement that offends Article 8. Nagre  does  not  add
    anything to the debate, save for the statement  that  if  a  particular
    person is outside the rule then he has to demonstrate, as a preliminary
    to a consideration outside the rule, that he has an arguable case  that
    there may be good grounds for granting  leave  to  remain  outside  the
    rules.  I  cannot  see  much  utility   in   imposing   this   further,
    intermediary, test. If the applicant  cannot  satisfy  the  rule,  then
    there either is or there is not a further Article 8  claim.  That  will
    have to be determined by the relevant decision-maker.




 7. The judge's failure to conduct a "further, intermediary, test" did  not
    in itself vitiate his determination of the appeal  on  Article  8  ECHR
    grounds.  However, the question does remain as  to  whether  the  judge
    should, on the particular facts of this case, have  allowed  an  appeal
    under Article 8 ECHR.  Although MM now makes it clear that there is  no
    test to be passed or  hurdle  surmounted,  the  principles  of  Gulshan
    remain good law.  The head note of Gulshan reads as follows:

   On the current state of the authorities:

   (a)    the maintenance requirements  of  E-LTRP.3.1-3.2  stand,  although
   Blake J in R (on the application of MM)  v Secretary  of  State  for  the
   Home Department [2013] EWHC 1900 (Admin) said that they could  constitute
   an unjustified and disproportionate  interference  with  the  ability  of
   spouses to live together; he suggested that an appropriate figure may  be
   around ï¿½13,400, and highlighted the position of young people and low wage
   earners caught by the higher figure in the rules;
   (b)    after applying the requirements of the Rules, only if there may be
   arguably good grounds for granting leave to remain  outside  them  is  it
   necessary for Article 8 purposes to go on to consider whether  there  are
   compelling circumstances not sufficiently recognised under  them:  R  (on
   the application of) Nagre v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department
   [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin);
   (c)    the term "insurmountable obstacles" in provisions such as  Section
   EX.1 are not obstacles which are impossible to surmount: MF (Article 8  -
   new rules) Nigeria [2012] UKUT 393 (IAC); Izuazu (Article 8 - new  rules)
   [2013] UKUT  45  (IAC);  they  concern  the  practical  possibilities  of
   relocation. In the  absence  of  such  insurmountable  obstacles,  it  is
   necessary  to   show   other   non-standard   and   particular   features
   demonstrating that removal will be unjustifiably harsh: Nagre.

   The Secretary of State addressed the Article  8  family  aspects  of  the
   respondent's position through the  Rules,  in  particular  EX1,  and  the
   private life aspects through paragraph 276ADE. The judge should have done
   likewise, also paying attention to the Guidance. Thus  the  judge  should
   have considered the Secretary of State's conclusion under EX.1 that there
   were no insurmountable  obstacles  preventing  the  continuation  of  the
   family life outside the UK. Only if there were arguably good grounds  for
   granting leave to remain outside the rules was it necessary for  him  for
   Article 8 purposes to go on to consider  whether  there  were  compelling
   circumstances not sufficiently recognised under the Rules.




 8. The appellant in this appeal not only appears to have accepted that  he
    could not succeed under the Immigration Rules; he  has  not  challenged
    the judge's determination dismissing his appeal on that ground.  As  in
    Gulshan, "the judge should have considered  the  Secretary  of  State's
    conclusion under  EX1  that  there  were  no  insurmountable  obstacles
    preventing the continuation of the family life outside the UK."   There
    is nothing in the judge's Article 8 ECHR analysis which indicates  that
    there were any arguably good or compelling grounds for  granting  leave
    to  remain  outside  the  Rules.   Indeed,  the  only  factors  in  the
    appellant's favour to which the judge refers were  factors  which  were
    irrelevant (for example, that the appellant had  not  been  engaged  in
    criminal activities whilst in the United Kingdom) or which had  already
    fallen  for  consideration  under  the  Immigration  Rules  (that   the
    appellant's wife is a British citizen and that  her  relationship  with
    the appellant is genuine and subsisting).  The judge  has  referred  to
    nothing  whatsoever  in  his  determination  which  would  justify  the
    granting of  leave  to  remain  outside  the  Rules.   The  appellant's
    circumstances fall fairly and squarely within  the  provisions  of  the
    Rules themselves which he acknowledges he has failed to satisfy.

 9. Consequently, although I find that the judge did not err by failing  to
    identify  any  compelling  circumstances  which  would  enable  him  to
    determine the appeal on Article 8 grounds, he did err by proceeding  to
    conduct a full Article 8 consideration where there was no need, on  the
    particular facts of the case, for him to do so.  In the  circumstances,
    I set aside the determination.   I  have  remade  the  decision.   This
    appeal is dismissed on Article 8  grounds  and  under  the  Immigration
    Rules.

DECISION

10. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal promulgated  on  5  August
    2014 is set aside.  I have remade the decision.  The appellant's appeal
    is dismissed under the Immigration Rules.  The  appellant's  appeal  is
    dismissed on human rights grounds (Article 8 ECHR).
