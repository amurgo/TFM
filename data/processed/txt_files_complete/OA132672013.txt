Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Deller (Home Office Presenting
      Officer)
For the Respondent:    Mr Martin, Counsel, instructed by Nag Law
      Solicitors

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. Whereas the  respondent  is  the  appealing  party,  I  shall,  in  the
    interests of convenience and consistency, replicate the nomenclature of
    the decision at first instance.


 2. The appellant, born February 2, 1988, is a citizen of  Vietnam  On  May
    16, 2013 the appellant applied for entry clearance as a spouse.

 3. The respondent refused her application on June 4,  2013  on  the  basis
    he/she was not  satisfied  the  requirements  of  Appendix  FM  and  in
    particular the application was refused for failing to satisfy:-

     a. Section E-ECP 2.6 and 2.10 of Appendix FM (genuine  and  subsisting
        relationship)
     b. Section E-ECP 3.1 of Appendix FM (financial  requirements  required
        under Appendix FM-SE)

 4. On June 14, 2013 the appellant appealed  under  Section  82(1)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. The  respondent  reviewed
    the grounds of appeal but maintained the refusal.

 5. The matter was listed before Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Khan
    (hereinafter referred to as "the FtTJ")  on  May  14,  2014  and  in  a
    determination promulgated on May 30,  2014  he  found  the  Immigration
    Rules had not been met but allowed the appellant's appeal under article
    8 ECHR on the grounds that refusal was disproportionate.

 6. The respondent appealed that decision on June 4,  2014.  Permission  to
    appeal was granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal McDade  on  July
    2, 2014. She found the FtTJ may have erred because the FtTJ had  failed
    to identify compelling circumstances not sufficiently recognised  under
    the Rules.

 7. The sponsor was not in attendance.

    SUBMISSIONS ON ERROR OF LAW


 8. Mr Deller relied on the grounds of appeal and submitted the FtTJ  erred
    by allowing the appeal on article 8 grounds.

 9. Mr Deller submitted the FtTJ recognised that the appellant did not meet
    the Immigration Rules and in  particular  she  failed  to  satisfy  the
    requirements of Appendix FM-SE with regard to submitting  the  required
    financial  information  and  she  failed  to  demonstrate  the  sponsor
    satisfied the �18,600 threshold contained in the Rules. Having  refused
    the appeal under the Immigration Rules the FtTJ failed to identify what
    compelling circumstances as set out in R (on the application of)  Nagre
    v SSHD [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin) and Gulshan [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC).  In
    particular the FtTJ erred because:-

     a. He considered the appeal based on what Blake J said  in  MM  [2013]
        EWHC 1900 (Admin). This approach was wrong for two  reasons  namely
        he should have followed the  approach  in  Nagre  and  Gulshan  and
        secondly, the Court of Appeal had clarified the  Immigration  Rules
        in MM (Lebanon) & Ors, R (on the application  of)  v  Secretary  of
        State for the Home Department & Anor [2014] EWCA Civ 985. The Court
        of Appeal made it clear that the Rules were fair and it was not for
        judges  to  apply  a  different  figure  or  a  different  way   of
        calculating income.


     b. The fact it was a "near miss" was not a good reason to consider the
        appeal under article 8. The decision in Miah [2012]  EWCA  Civ  261
        confirmed there is no such thing in law as a near miss.

     c. An  available  remedy  was  to  reapply  and  provide  the  correct
        documents.

10. Mr Martin submitted there was no  error  in  law.  He  referred  me  to
    paragraphs [73] and [160] of MM (Lebanon)  and  reminded  me  that  the
    Immigration Rules were there to codify what was required to be admitted
    as a spouse but he submitted that whereas in the case of a  deportation
    the Rules were a complete code this was not the case  in  a  settlement
    application. He submitted the FtTJ was entitled to consider the  appeal
    outside of the Rules  because  he  had  identified  circumstances  that
    merited consideration. In particular, he had  provided  documents  that
    showed his income was above the �18,600 threshold but  those  documents
    did not satisfy Appendix FM-SE. In  addition,  he  had  not  failed  to
    comply with substantial requirements of the rules but merely procedural
    requirements and  in  these  circumstances  Miah  did  not  apply.  The
    respondent could have requested  further  information  or  assumed  the
    rules were met based on the evidence before her. The FtTJ accepted  the
    marriage was genuine and subsisting and he  accepted  the  evidence  of
    income. The economic well-being of the  country  was  not  affected  in
    these circumstances and it was open  to  him  to  consider  the  appeal
    outside of the Rules and to allow the appeal.

11. Mr Deller responded to these  submissions  and  submitted  it  was  not
    justifiable to distinguish between substantive  and  procedural  rules.
    Appellants had previously argued that the if something was not  in  the
    Rules then it was not binding and  the  Supreme  Court  in  R  (on  the
    application of Alvi) (Respondent) v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
    Department (Appellant) [2012]  UKSC  33  upheld  this  submission.  The
    appellant had not met the requirements  of  the  Rules  and  there  was
    nothing else about  this  case  that  should  have  led  to  a  Gulshan
    consideration.


    ERROR OF LAW ASSESSMENT


12. The FtTJ had the advantage of hearing oral evidence in this appeal  and
    he also had the  benefit  of  listening  to  submissions  made  by  the
    appellant's representative.

13. At the hearing the sponsor  adopted  his  witness  statement  and  gave
    further evidence on the state of his relationship with his wife and his
    financial circumstances. In closing submissions the respondent  pointed
    out that the claimed turnover was not reflected in the bank  statements
    and the accountants  did not meet the requirements of  Appendix  FM-SE.
    The appellant's  representative  stated  the  sponsor  could  not  meet
    Appendix FM-SE paragraph 7 because in relation to the twelve month bank
    statements as well as his personal bank statements he  could  not  show
    the money from the business went into the business account and he  also
    accepted the accountant had not confirmed they were regulated with  the
    appropriate   professional   body.   The   appellant's   representative
    specifically relied on paragraphs [124], [139] and [153] of  MM  (Blake
    J) and argued the appeal should be allowed under article 8 ECHR.

14. The  FtTJ  recognised  in  paragraph  [12]  of  his  determination  the
    difficulty the appellant faced. However, he did exactly what the  Court
    in MM (Lebanon) made clear judges should not do namely he looked at the
    sponsor's financial circumstances and substituted his own  approach  to
    how the Rule should have been applied.

15. Despite Mr Martin's efforts to persuade me that the decision  contained
    no material error I am satisfied that there  were  two  errors  in  the
    FtTJ's approach and by implication Mr  Martin's  submissions.  Firstly,
    the courts in MM (Lebanon,  Gulshan  and  Nagre  set  out  the  correct
    approach to be taken. The FtTJ did not  follow  this  approach.  Having
    refused  the  application  under  the  Immigration   rules   the   FtTJ
    immediately considered the appeal under article 8. This is an error  in
    law. Secondly, by following Blake J's reasoning in  MM  he  also  erred
    because the Court of Appeal found the Rules were fair. The FtTJ allowed
    the appeal because he found the refusal  disproportionate  because  the
    Rules were unfair because in his view the sponsor met the  requirements
    albeit not in the manner specified in the Rules.

16. I therefore find the FtTJ materially erred in his approach to this case
    with regard to article 8 ECHR.

17. I invited both parties to make any final submissions  on  whether  this
    was firstly a case which should be considered outside of the Rules  and
    even if it was whether refusal would be disproportionate.

    SUBMISSIONS


18. Mr Deller had nothing to add to what he had already said and relied  on
    those submissions.

19. Mr Martin submitted there was  difference  between  a  substantive  and
    procedural requirement. The FtTJ found the sponsor had an  income  over
    �18,600 and whilst Appendix  FM-SE  ensured  consistency  in  decisions
    there were exceptions that could be considered and the Rules were not a
    complete code. There was no economic reason to refuse  the  application
    and the case should be considered outside the Rules as refusal would be
    unjustifiably harsh in light of the fact the sponsor was  British,  the
    relationship was genuine and the appellant had delayed  submitting  her
    application whilst she satisfied the English language  requirement.  He
    submitted the appeal should be allowed under article 8.

    CONSIDERATION OF SUBSTANTIVE APPEAL

20. The issues in this appeal were as follows:-


     a. As the Appellant did not meet the Immigration  Rules  were  they  a
        complete code?
     b. If not, were there compelling reasons to consider it outside of the
        Immigration  Rules  that  would  result  in   unjustifiably   harsh
        consequences for him.
     c.  If  the  case  was  considered  outside  of  the  Rules   was   it
        proportionate to refuse her entry.

21. Both the sponsor and appellant  were  aware  of  the  Rules  when  this
    application was submitted. I say that because the appellant delayed her
    application to gain an English language  certificate  and  the  sponsor
    provided documents that he believed satisfied the Rules.
22. The FtTJ found the appellant could not  satisfy Appendix FM because  he
    had failed to demonstrate he met the financial requirements as set  out
    in the Rules and he had also  failed  to  prove  the  accountants,  who
    provided him with his accounts and a letter  confirming  themselves  as
    his accountants, had failed to show they were regulated as required.

23. Mr Martin has submitted that these are procedural requirements and  not
    substantive requirements. I disagree.

24. The Rules clearly set out what has to  be  done  to  be  admitted.  The
    requirements for a successful entry clearance application are carefully
    set out in the Rules. The Court of Appeal in  MM  (Lebanon)  reiterated
    those Rules were not disproportionate.

25. The requirement for an accountant  to  be  properly  regulated  is  not
    merely procedural but substantive. The aim of that Rule was  to  ensure
    that accounts and letters from accountants could be relied  on  without
    further query about their credentials. The appellant and  sponsor  were
    aware of the Rules but did not address this  fault  either  before  the
    First-tier judge or myself.

26. The Rules also provide various routes that enable a person to meet  the
    financial requirements. These take account of people  who  are  retired
    and live on savings, people  who  are  employed  and  of  course  self-
    employed people.

27. The appellant was aware of what was needed and he of course  chose  not
    to pay his monies into his bank account and to use cash  generated  for
    whatever purpose. The rules are there so that anyone wanting to bring a
    spouse into this country knows what  has  to  be  shown.  There  is  no
    difficult calculation  because  the  Rules  set  out  what  has  to  be
    produced.

28. The appellant and sponsor did not meet the Rules  and  the  FtTJ  quite
    rightly made that finding.

29. I am invited to consider the appeal under article 8 ECHR. The Courts in
    MM (Lebanon) & Ors, R (on the application of) v Secretary of State  for
    the  Home  Department  &  Anor  [2014]  EWCA  Civ  985  considered  the
    approaches in Gulshan [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC) and Nagre [2013] EWHC 720
    Admin and confirmed the approach to be taken.

  30. The Court of Appeal in MM examined numerous authorities and stated:


         "128. ... In Nagre the new  rules  were  themselves  attempting  to
         cover, generally,  circumstances  where  an  individual  should  be
         allowed to remain in the UK on Article 8 grounds... Nagre does  not
         add anything to the debate,  save  for  the  statement  that  if  a
         particular person is outside the rule then he has  to  demonstrate,
         as a preliminary to a consideration outside the rule, that  he  has
         an arguable case that there may be good grounds for granting  leave
         to remain outside  the  rules.    I  cannot  see  much  utility  in
         imposing this  further,  intermediary,  test.    If  the  applicant
         cannot satisfy the rule, then there either is or  there  is  not  a
         further Article 8 claim.  That will have to be  determined  by  the
         relevant decision-maker.


         134. Where the relevant group  of  Immigration  Rules,  upon  their
         proper construction, provide a "complete code" for dealing  with  a
         person's Convention rights in the context of  a  particular  IR  or
         statutory provision, such as in the case  of  "foreign  criminals",
         then the balancing exercise and the way the various factors are  to
         be taken into account  in  an  individual  case  must  be  done  in
         accordance with that  code,  although  references  to  "exceptional
         circumstances"   in   the   code   will   nonetheless   entail    a
         proportionality  exercise.    But  if   the   relevant   group   of
         Immigration  Rules  is  not  such  a  "complete  code"   then   the
         proportionality test will be more at large, albeit  guided  by  the
         Huang tests and UK and Strasbourg case law.


         159. ... It seems clear from the statement of Lord Dyson MR  in  MF
         (Nigeria) and Sales J in Nagre that a court would have to  consider
         first whether the  new  MIR  and  the  "Exceptional  circumstances"
         created a "complete code" and,  if  they  did,  precisely  how  the
         "proportionality test"  would  be  applied  by  reference  to  that
         "code".


         162. ... Firstly, paragraph GEN.1.1 of Appendix FM states that  the
         provision of the family route  "takes  into  account  the  need  to
         safeguard and promote the welfare of children  in  the  UK",  which
         indicates that the  Secretary  of  State  has  had  regard  to  the
         statutory duty.   Secondly, there is no legal requirement that  the
         Immigration Rules should provide that the  best  interests  of  the
         child should be determinative.   Section 55 is not a  "trump  card"
         to be played whenever the interests of a child arise..."


  31. I have to consider whether a refusal  would  result  in  unjustifiably
      harsh consequences  for  the  individual  such  that  refusal  of  the
      application would not be proportionate.


  32. Based on the facts of this case I am  unable  to  find  good  arguable
      grounds or compelling circumstances not sufficiently recognised  under
      Appendix  FM,  where  refusal  would  result  in  unjustifiably  harsh
      consequences for the  appellant.  I  am  satisfied  the  rules  are  a
      complete code in this application and the failure to satisfy  them  is
      something that the appellant and sponsor could have addressed.

  33. In these circumstances I find there is no basis to allow  this  appeal
      under article 8 ECHR.

    DECISION


34. There is a material error of law and I set aside the original  decision
    under article 8ECHR.


35. I have remade the article 8 decision and I  dismiss  the  appeal  under
    Article 8 ECHR.

36. Under Rule 14(1) The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (as
    amended) the  appellant  can  be  granted  anonymity  throughout  these
    proceedings, unless and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise. No
    order has been made and no request for an order was submitted to me.
