                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is the appellant's appeal  against  the  decision  of  Immigration
    Judge Saffer made following a hearing at Bradford on 28th October 2015.







Background

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Sri Lanka born on 9th November 1982.

 3. Her husband, Dr Channa Ranatunga, entered the UK as a student  on  10th
    October 2004 with leave which  was  subsequently  extended  until  31st
    January 2010.   The couple married in 2007 and on 21st  September  2007
    she also entered the UK as a student with  leave  until  January  2009.
    Having completed her MSc at Coventry University she switched to a  Tier
    1 (Post-Study Work) Migrant visa which expired on 16th  February  2011.
    Her husband, having completed his degree also switched to a Tier 1 visa
    valid until 27th January 2012.  He was subsequently granted  a  further
    visa until 25th January 2015 during which time he completed his PhD  at
    the University  of  Hull.   Having  completed  his  ten  years'  lawful
    residence in the UK he was granted indefinite leave to remain  on  10th
    January 2015.

 4. Their child [KR] was born on [ ] 2015 and is a British citizen.

 5. The appellant applied for a spouse visa on 15th January  2015  but  was
    refused on 25th February 2015 on the grounds that the income  threshold
    was not met.  At that time she was working in two jobs on  a  part-time
    basis, as was her husband,  but  she  did  not  provide  the  specified
    evidence in relation to the employment.  The Secretary of State was not
    satisfied that she met the income threshold of  ï¿½18,600,  she  had  not
    lived in the UK for twenty years and it would not be unduly  harsh  for
    the family to relocate to Sir Lanka. It was this decision which was the
    subject of the appeal before Judge Saffer.

 6. Judge Saffer recorded that the child's British nationality  was  not  a
    trump card.  He was not in the education system in the UK and was being
    denied the opportunity of being brought up  in  his  parents'  homeland
    where they were both citizens.  The appellant had failed to provide the
    specified evidence relating to the period prior to the application  and
    could not establish even at the date of the hearing that they fulfilled
    the income threshold required by the Rules.  Her limited  private  life
    had always been precarious given her temporary status  and  the  family
    were a burden on the public purse given the fact that she uses the NHS.



 7. He concluded as follows:

         "It is in [KR]'s  best  interest  (given  his  tender  age)  to  be
         together with his parents where they can  lawfully  live.   If  his
         parents choose to live in different countries it is  reasonable  to
         expect him to go with his mother.  He can  come  back  whenever  he
         wishes  and  his  father  can  visit   him   whenever   he   wants.
         Alternatively he can stay with Mr  Ranatunga  while  the  appellant
         makes an application for entry clearance if Mr Ranatunga chooses to
         stay here.  He is not therefore being denied his rights as  an  EEA
         citizen.

         If they all choose to go to Sri Lanka his  parents  can  both  work
         there.  There is  no  evidence  that  in  Sri  Lanka  he  would  be
         neglected or abused, or that he would have unmet needs  that  could
         not be catered for, and there are no stable  arrangements  for  his
         physical care that can be put in place.  He can in due course go to
         school in Sri Lanka which is where his parents were educated.   The
         quality of education may not be as high as here  but  it  was  good
         enough for his parents to be able to  come  here.   He  can  access
         health services there."

 8. On that basis he dismissed the appeal.



The grounds of appeal

 9. The grounds argue that the judge  failed  to  adequately  consider  and
    apply Section 117B(6) of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
    2002 which provides that the  public  interest  does  not  require  the
    person's  removal  where  the  person  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship with a qualifying child (the appellant is the mother of  a
    British citizen child) and it would not be  reasonable  to  expect  the
    child to leave the UK.

10. The judge erroneously finds that it would be reasonable to  expect  the
    child to go with his mother.  However the Presenting Officer failed  to
    discharge her duty to draw the  relevant  Home  Office  policy  to  the
    Tribunal's attention; the appellant had a basic  public  law  right  to
    have her case considered under  the  policy.   Immigration  Directorate
    Instruction Family Migration: Appendix FM, Section 1.0(b)  Family  Life
    (as a Partner or Parent) and Private Life: 10-Year Routes  provides  as
    follows so far as is material:

         "11.2.3  Would it be unreasonable to expect a British citizen child
               to leave the UK?

              Save in cases involving criminality, the decision  maker  must
               not take a decision in relation to  the  parent  or  primary
               carer of a British Citizen child where the  effect  of  that
               decision would be to force that British child to  leave  the
               EU, regardless of the age of that child.  This reflects  the
               European Court of Justice judgment in Zambrano.

              Where a decision to refuse the  application  would  require  a
               parent or primary carer to return to a country  outside  the
               EU, the case must always be assessed on the  basis  that  it
               would be unreasonable to expect a British citizen  child  to
               leave the EU with that parent or primary carer.

              In such cases it will usually be appropriate to grant leave to
               the parent or primary carer, to enable them to remain in the
               UK with the  child,  provided  that  there  is  satisfactory
               evidence of a genuine and subsisting parental relationship.

              It may, however, be appropriate to refuse to grant leave where
               the conduct of the parent or primary  carer  gives  rise  to
               considerations of such weight as to justify  separation,  if
               the child  could  otherwise  stay  with  another  parent  or
               alternative primary carer in the UK or in the EU.

              The circumstances envisaged could cover amongst others:

                    o Criminality falling below the thresholds set  out  in
                      paragraph 398 of the Immigration Rules;

                    o A very poor immigration history, such  as  where  the
                      person has repeatedly and deliberately  breached  the
                      Immigration Rules."

11. Although the judge considered  Sanade  &  Others  (British  children  -
    Zambrano - Dereci) [2011] UKUT 48 (IAC) he failed to  adequately  apply
    it.  In Sanade it was held inter alia that:

         "Ruiz Zambrano, Bailii: [2011] EUECH C-34/09  NOW  makes  it  clear
         that where the child or indeed the remaining spouse  is  a  British
         citizen and therefore a citizen of the EU, as a matter of EU law it
         is not possible to require the family as a unit to relocate outside
         of the European Union or for the Secretary of State to submit  that
         it would be reasonable for them to do so."

12. The judge therefore erroneously found that the child  could  stay  with
    her husband whilst the appellant made an  entry  clearance  application
    but this was not reasonably open to  him  given  the  evidence  of  her
    husband that if the appellant had to go to Sri Lanka  the  child  would
    have to go with her.

13. Finally, the judge  erroneously  applied  the  test  of  insurmountable
    obstacles whereas the reasonableness of  relocation  remains  the  test
    under Article 8 outside the Rules.

14. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge Nicholson on 25th April  2016
    for the reasons stated in the grounds.  The  judge  said  that  it  was
    arguable that Judge Saffer ought to have allowed  the  appeal  in  line
    with the comments in Treebhawon & Others (Section 117B(6)) [2015]  UKUT
    674.

15. On 13th May 2016 the respondent served a reply arguing that  the  judge
    had in fact looked at the reasonableness of the British  citizen  child
    leaving  the  UK  and  implicitly  concluded  that  it  would  not   be
    unreasonable for him to go to Sri Lanka.   He  had  also  considered  a
    number of scenarios including that the child could  remain  in  the  UK
    with his father.  Accordingly, the findings were open to the judge, not
    irrational and the grounds amount to a disagreement with the  decision.





Submissions

16. Mr Solomon relied on his grounds.

17. He accepted that, according to the determination,  Counsel  before  the
    First-tier Judge had conceded that the appellant  could  not  meet  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules, although he said  that  in  fact
    Counsel had been wrong to do so since arguably the appeal ought to have
    been allowed under paragraph EX.1.

18. He submitted that it was incumbent on the Presenting  Officer  to  draw
    the attention of the Immigration Judge to the relevant Rules and policy
    and in not doing so the Presenting  Officer  had  failed  in  his  duty
    before the judge.  The appellant clearly fell within the ambit  of  the
    policy,  having  an  impeccable  immigration  history.   She  had  been
    lawfully in the UK throughout the entire period and in fact,  when  she
    discovered that she was unable to switch from having a  Tier  1  (Post-
    Study) Work visa to becoming a point-based  system  dependant  in  line
    with her husband's Tier 1 visa,  she  left  the  UK  before  her  leave
    expired in February 2011 and made an application from Sri Lanka  ,which
    was granted for the same duration as her husband's.

19. Mr Solomon argued that the judge's conclusion that the appellant  could
    relocate to Sri Lanka was contrary to established case law.  In MA & SM
    (Zambrano: EU children outside EU) Iran [2013] UKUT 380,  at  paragraph
    68 the Tribunal wrote as follows:

         "In Izuazu the Secretary of State  made  the  following  concession
         (recorded in Appendix A to the determination):

             'The Secretary of State continues to  accept  that  where  the
             primary carer of a British citizen is denied a Zambrano  right
             of  residence  on  the  basis  that  his  or  her  removal  or
             deportation would not force the British citizen to  leave  the
             EU, it will not logically be  possible  when  considering  any
             Article 8 claim made by such a person to determine their claim
             on the basis that the family (including the  British  citizen)
             can relocate together to a place outside the EU. However,  the
             Secretary of State does not accept that it follows that  there
             will be no circumstances in which a decision taken in  respect
             of the primary carer of a British  citizen  can  require  that
             British citizen to leave the UK. The Secretary of  State  does
             not consider that the UK Border  Agency  letter  sent  to  the
             Tribunal in Sanade suggested that she did accept  that  it  is
             never reasonable to expect a British citizen party to  genuine
             family life in the  UK  to  relocate  permanently  abroad  but
             apologises for any lack of clarity in the correspondence which
             may have caused the Tribunal to reach this conclusion'."

20. The evidence in this case was that the child would have to go with  his
    mother because at the time of the hearing he was 4 months old and still
    being breastfed.

21. Mr Diwnycz relied formally on his Rule 24 reply but accepted  that  the
    appellant had made out her case.



Conclusions on whether the judge erred in law

22. Under paragraph EX.1 of Appendix FM to the Immigration  Rules,  if  the
    appellant has a genuine and subsisting  parental  relationship  with  a
    child who, is, inter alia, a  British  citizen  and  it  would  not  be
    reasonable to expect him to leave the UK, the appellant is entitled  to
    succeed within the Immigration Rules.

23. The Immigration Act 2014 set out at paragraph 117B the public  interest
    considerations applicable in all cases relating to  Article  8  and  in
    particular, at paragraph 117B(6) states:

         "In the case of a person who is  not  liable  to  deportation,  the
         public interest does not require the person's removal where -

         (a)  the person has a genuine and subsisting parental  relationship
             with a qualifying child, and

         (b)  it would not be reasonable to expect the child  to  leave  the
             UK."

24. The judge did not refer to Section 117B(6) and, in citing the  test  of
    insurmountable obstacles at paragraph 16 of his determination,  appears
    to have erroneously not  applied  his  mind  to  the  correct  test  of
    reasonableness of relocation.

25. Moreover, his attention was clearly not drawn, as it should have  been,
    to the relevant  IDIs  to  be  applied  in  cases  where  refusing  the
    application would require a  primary  carer  to  return  to  a  country
    outside the EU.

26. In Mandalia v SSHD [2015] UKSC 59 the Supreme Court stated:

         "19. It follows, however, that the Court of Appeal was  handicapped
             by the lack of any analysis  of  the  effect  of  the  process
             instruction on the lawfulness  of  the  agency's  decision  by
             either of the specialist tribunals below. It  was  unfortunate
             not only that the judge's grant of permission to appeal to the
             Court of Appeal was couched in ambiguous terms but  also  that
             other judges of the Upper  Tribunal  misconstrued  it  and  so
             declined to address that part of Mr  Mandalia's  appeal  which
             was based on the process instruction. But it  was  still  more
             unfortunate that no reference had been  made  to  the  process
             instruction before the First-tier Tribunal. Mr Mandalia  could
             not be expected to have been aware of it. But, irrespective of
             whether the specialist  judge  might  reasonably  be  expected
             himself to have been aware of it, the Home  Office  Presenting
             Officer clearly failed to discharge his duty to draw it to the
             tribunal's attention as policy of  the  agency  which  was  at
             least arguably relevant  to  Mr  Mandalia's  appeal:   see  AA
             Afghanistan v SSHD [2007] EWCA Civ at paragraph 13."

27. Moreover in R (Lumba) v SSHD [2011] UKSC 12 Lord Dyson said:

         "35. The individual has a basic public law right to have his or her
             case considered under whatever policy the executive  sees  fit
             to adopt provided that the adopted policy is a lawful exercise
             of the discretion conferred by the statute."

28. Accordingly, the judge erred in law and his decision is set aside.



Findings and Conclusions

29. Neither party made any further submissions.  Mr Diwnycz  in  particular
    did not argue either that the IDIs did not apply nor  that  there  were
    any adverse factors in this case  which  militated  in  favour  of  the
    appellant being refused.

30. In Treebhawon & Others (Section 117B(6)) [2015] UKUT 674 the  President
    of the Tribunal said as follows:

         "20.  In  section  117B(6),   Parliament   has   prescribed   three
             conditions, namely:

          a) the person concerned is not liable to deportation;

          b) Such person has a genuine and subsisting parental relationship
             with a qualifying child, namely a person who is under the  age
             of 18 and is a British citizen or  has  lived  in  the  United
             Kingdom for a continuous period of seven years or more; and

          c) it would not be reasonable to expect the qualifying  child  to
             leave the United Kingdom.

         Within this discrete regime, the  statute  proclaims  unequivocally
         that where these three conditions are satisfied the public interest
         does not require the removal of the parent from the United Kingdom.
         Ambiguity there is none."

    The Tribunal went on to hold that Sections 1 to 3 of  Section  117B  do
    not apply and that it would  further  appear  that  the  little  weight
    provisions of Sections 117B(4) and (5) are similarly of no application.

31. It was rightly not argued that there are any countervailing factors  in
    this case.  The appellant has a  perfect  immigration  history,  having
    complied with the terms of her visa at all times.

32. The effect of the decision to refuse this application would be to force
    the British citizen child  to  leave  the  EU,  since  he  is  entirely
    dependent upon his primary carer, his mother.

33. The case must  be  assessed  on  the  basis  of  whether  it  would  be
    unreasonable to expect the appellant's British citizen child  to  leave
    the EU with her. Her case falls squarely within the IDIs  cited  above.
    If it would not be reasonable to expect him to go to Sri  Lanka,   then
    the appeal falls to be allowed in line with Section 117B(6) of the 2002
    Act. Those provisions are mirrored in paragraph EX.1.

34. The appeal therefore succeeds both within and without  the  Immigration
    Rules.



Decision

35. The original judge erred in law.  His decision is set aside and re-made
    as follows.  The appellant's appeal is allowed.
No anonymity direction is made.
