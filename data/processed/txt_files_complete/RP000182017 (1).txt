    Upon the parties agreement that the  determination  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal promulgated on 18 April 2017 discloses  a  material  error  of
    law, it is hereby ordered by consent that:

      1. The judge made material errors of law in  relation  to  the  errors
         identified in the grounds of appeal.

      2. The determination is set aside in its  entirety  with  no  findings
         preserved, and

      3. The matter is remitted to be heard by a  judge  of  the  First-tier
         Tribunal other than Judge Chana.

    The Appellant's appeal in the Upper Tribunal is therefore allowed.  The
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside for legal error.
