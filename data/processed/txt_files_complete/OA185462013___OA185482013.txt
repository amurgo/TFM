Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr M Diwnycz, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Mr B Smith, Counsel instructed by A Bajwa & Co,
Solicitors

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The respondents, Amy Chowdhowry and Abarar  Mahi,  shall  hereafter  be
    referred to in this decision as the appellants (as they appeared before
    the First-tier Tribunal).  The appellant, the Entry Clearance  Officer,
    Dhaka, shall be referred to as the Respondent.

 2. The first appellant is the mother of the second appellant.   They  both
    sought to enter the United Kingdom for  settlement  with  the  sponsor,
    Abdul Hannan, who is the husband of the first appellant and  father  of
    the  second  appellant.   An  application  was  refused  by  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer (Dhaka) in a decision dated 23 September  2014.   The
    appellants appealed to the First-tier Tribunal (Judge D A Pears) which,
    in a determination promulgated on 4 December 2014, allowed the  appeal.
    The Entry Clearance Officer now appeals, with permission, to the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 3. The appeal turns on a relatively  narrow  point.   The  respondent  had
    refused  the  application  of  the  appellants  because  the  sponsor's
    supporting financial evidence failed to  comply  with  Appendix  FM-SE.
    The sponsor had failed to submit bank statements corresponding  to  the
    same period as the payslips showing the salary has been paid  into  the
    person's account: the refusal letter records that, "while  I  am  aware
    you have submitted bank statements, the credits in the account  do  not
    correspond with the amounts indicated on  the  payslips".   It  is  not
    disputed that the cash sums paid gross to the sponsor (who works in the
    Joypur Restaurant) were not remitted in full to the  bank  account  for
    which he has now produced statements.  The  sponsor  had  produced  P60
    forms for 2013 and 2014 showing gross  annual  income  of  �23,531  and
    �23,600 respectively.  As Judge Pears noted, the sponsor received about
    �450 per week gross "but they are not fixed [payments] and  vary  by  a
    few pounds per week and he pays about �360 from his cash payments  into
    his bank account with Yorkshire Bank".  Judge Pears went on to note  at
    [8] that:

         Paragraph 2 of Appendix FM-SE includes this, in respect of salaried
         [my emphasis] employment in the UK all the following evidence  must
         be provided (f) monthly personal bank statements  corresponding  to
         the same period as the wage slips at paragraph  2(c)  showing  that
         the salary [my emphasis] has been paid into an account in the  name
         of the person....

 4. Judge Pears went on to make two points.  First, he considered that  the
    Immigration Rules did  not  "envisage  cash  wages  but  straight  bank
    transfers from the employer's  bank  account  to  the  employee's  bank
    account."  I am  not  sure  that  that  necessarily  follows  from  the
    requirement set out in Appendix FM-SE.  The second point was  that  the
    Rule referred only to "salaried employment in the UK and the sponsor is
    not in salaried employment but receives variably weekly wages."   Judge
    Pears noted the Oxford English dictionary definition of the  salary  as
    "fixed payment made  periodically  to  a  person  as  compensation  for
    regular work: now usually restricted to payments made for non-manual or
    non-mechanical work (as opposed  to  wages)."   In  consequence,  Judge
    Pears did not consider that Appendix FM-SE had  any  "applicability  to
    the appellant and sponsor."  He found that the sponsor  had  proved  by
    submitting his P60s, wage slips, bank statements and a letter from  his
    employer that he earned more than �22,400 per annum.  On that basis, he
    allowed the appeal.

 5. The grounds of appeal assert that the judge erred in law  by  exempting
    the sponsor from producing the evidence required by Appendix  FM-SE  in
    respect of his income.

 6. This appeal turns on the construction of the words "salaried employment
    in the UK"  as they appear in Appendix FM-SE.  The question is  whether
    the proper construction of "salaried  employment"  is  wide  enough  to
    embrace the employment circumstances of the sponsor in  this  instance.
    Having regard to the ordinary meaning of the words and  to  the  Oxford
    English dictionary definition there is, arguably, a difference  between
    "salary" and "wages", the latter most generally being used  in  respect
    of payment for (variable) hours worked whereas a "salary" is determined
    by payment of an annual sum by way of  remuneration  divided  into  and
    paid at either monthly or weekly intervals depending on  the  terms  of
    the contract of employment.  I am,  however,  not  persuaded  that  the
    Immigration Rules at Appendix FM-SE  intend  to  make  any  distinction
    between wages and salaried employment.  At Appendix FM-SE, A1(cc) it is
    stated that, "the income of an applicant or sponsor working in  the  UK
    in salaried  or  non-salaried  employment  or  in  self-employment  [my
    emphasis] can include income from work undertaken  overseas...".   That
    reference to "non-salaried employment" is the only such reference  that
    I can find in Appendix FM-SE. As a consequence and as  I  seek  explain
    below, I am not persuaded that the definition of salaried employment is
    so narrow as to exclude income from employment which is paid as  wages;
    to make that distinction is to impose a construction on the  provisions
    of Appendix FM which the ordinary meaning  of  the  words  used  cannot
    support.

 7. Dealing with the various requirements to supply documents in support of
    an application, Appendix FM-SE deals variously with salaried employment
    [2]; salaried employment outside the UK [3]; a job offer in the UK [4];
    statutory or contractual sick pay in the UK [6]; self-employment in the
    UK as a partner or sole trader who own a franchise [7]; self-employment
    outside of the UK [8]; income  "from  employment  and/or  shares  in  a
    limited company based in the UK of  the  type  specified  in  paragraph
    9(a)" [9]; non-employment income [10].  An income  derived  from  wages
    (as opposed to a salary) is not provided for at all under Appendix  FM-
    SE.  As I have noted, the single reference to "non-salaried employment"
    to which I have referred above does not recur and is  not  one  of  the
    categories of income from employment or non-employment  dealt  with  in
    the  remainder  of  the  paragraphs.   Following  Judge  Pears'  logic,
    Appendix  FM-SE  provides  for  there  to  be  no  specified   document
    requirements at all in respect of wage to the employment which  is  not
    salaried.  I do not consider that that can be right.  It makes no sense
    at all that the Rules should be drafted in  a  way  such  that  certain
    sponsors, in receipt of wages as opposed to  salary,  would  be  exempt
    from any requirement to provide documentary  evidence  on  her  income.
    The only logical construction of the  Rules,  therefore,  leads  me  to
    conclude that the words "salaried employment" must cover an  individual
    such as the sponsor in the present case whether or not  he  receives  a
    salary or wages.  It is unfortunate that the reference to "non-salaried
    employment" is not defined at all in the text of Appendix FM-SE  but  I
    consider that nothing more than an infelicity in the  drafting  of  the
    Rules.  I find, therefore, that the sponsor in  the  present  case  was
    required to prove that his income was sufficient was paid on a  regular
    basis into his bank account.  The sponsor acknowledges that the credits
    shown  in  the  account  are  insufficient  to   satisfy   the   income
    requirement.  It follows from that that Judge Pears  erred  in  law  by
    allowing the appeal.  I have therefore set aside his determination  and
    have re-made the decision.  The appeals of the appellants  against  the
    decisions of the Entry Clearance Officer are dismissed.





DECISION

 8. The First-tier Tribunal erred in law such that its determination  falls
    to be set aside.  I have re-made the  decision.   The  appeals  of  the
    appellants against the decisions of the Entry Clearance Officer,  Dhaka
    are dismissed under the Immigration Rules.
