Representation:

For the Appellant:     Appellant in person
For the Respondent:    Mr P Deller, HOPO


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a citizen of Kenya, born on 24  April  1970.   He  has
    been granted permission to appeal the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Walters  dismissing  his  appeal  against  the  decision  of  the
    respondent made on 17 April 2013, to refuse to issue a  residence  card
    as confirmation of a right of residence under the  EEA  Regulations  of
    2006.

2.   The appellant made his application on 10 September 2012  on  the  basis
    that on 28 January 2012  he  married  Oksana  Apanasevica,  a  Latvian
    national, under Kikuyu customary marriage rights by proxy because  both
    he and Miss Apanasevica were in the UK.  It  was  witnessed  by  a  few
    friends  and  relatives,  some  of  whom  had  submitted  a   statutory
    declaration.  He had also paid a dowry of �100 to his wife's family, by
    way of transfer to his wife's sister in Latvia.  The judge  found  that
    there was no evidence of the payment of the dowry, or its receipt.

3.   The judge repeatedly said that the appellant  had  deliberately  sought
    to marry under Kikuyu customary marriage rights in order to  circumvent
    the respondent's approach to immigration control.  This was because the
    appellant had been informed that he could  not  marry  in  the  UK  and
    obtain immigration status.

4.   The appellant had claimed that on the day of  his  marriage  to  Oksana
    Apanasevica, her sister remained in Latvia, although she talked to  the
    appellant's family members over the telephone.  However beyond what was
    contained in the statutory declaration, the judge found that there  was
    no evidence of Oksana Apanasevica's sister's presence  in  Latvia,  her
    knowledge of a Kikuyu customary marriage right, of a telephone call  to
    the material parties at or about the time of the marriage whether,  she
    would have known the significance of her contribution to  the  marriage
    right, or anything else.  Consequently the judge did  not  believe  the
    evidence.

5.   The appellant had submitted the Kenyan Marriage Bill, 2012 but  claimed
    in evidence that at the time of his  marriage  to  Oksana  Apanasevica,
    that bill did not  represent  the  law.   He  agreed  that  the  Kenyan
    Marriage Act 2008 was in place  when  he  married  in  accordance  with
    customary law, that he needed a witness to his  marriage  but  did  not
    need to register it.  Because the Kenyan Marriage  Bill  2012  had  not
    been implemented at  the  material  time,  he  was  not  bound  by  its
    provisions.  Again, the judge  found  that  there  was  no  independent
    corroboration of the appellant's evidence.  The judge concluded  having
    regard to the entirety of the evidence before him, that  the  appellant
    had not persuaded him that his claimed marriage to  Oksana  Apanasevica
    occurred and was conducted in accordance with Kikuyu customary marriage
    rights.

6.   Whilst noting what the appellant and Oksana Apanasevica claimed  to  be
    documentary evidence of their living together in the UK, the judge  was
    not persuaded that the documentation was genuine evidence of  a  shared
    life together and given his other  findings,  that  evidence  has  been
    deliberately contrived for the purposes of proceedings before him.   He
    was not persuaded that the appellant can be regarded as  the  unmarried
    partner of an EEA national in a durable relationship for  the  purposes
    of Regulation 8(5) of the 2006 EEA Regulations.

7.   The appellant was  granted  permission  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Osborne who said that  in  an  otherwise  careful  determination  which
    focused upon and engaged with the evidence, it  is  arguable  that  the
    appellant and his  spouse  did  not  know  that  they  would  be  asked
    questions about any dowry discussed by the appellant and paid  by  him.
    Nonetheless, they gave consistent evidence that the appellant had  paid
    a dowry to his spouse's sister-in-law  in  the  sum  of  �100.   It  is
    further arguable that the appellant gave the date of his marriage as 28
    July having found at paragraph 31 and at 37 that  the  appellant  could
    not remember the precise dates of his marriage and was not sure of  the
    date.  It is arguable that the judge failed to give adequate regard  to
    the consistent evidence of the appellant and his spouse in relation  to
    these matters and that to do so amounted to an arguable error of law.

8.   At the hearing before me the appellant attended  with  his  wife.   The
    Counsel who had represented him below was in court but he said that  he
    had not been instructed by the appellant to represent him today.

9.   The appellant accepted that he could not remember  the  exact  date  of
    his engagement although he remembered that it was  in  September  2011,
    the same month in which he and Oksana went to Scotland on the  16th  to
    celebrate their engagement.

10.  He said that they paid �100 to Oksana's sister in  Latvia.   The  money
    was transferred in cash from Barclay's Bank in the UK to  her  sister's
    account in Latvia.  The �100 formed part of a  larger  amount  of  �300
    which was transferred that day.  The extra �200 was  paid  towards  the
    funeral expenses of Oksana's  grandmother.   The  appellant  said  they
    could not find the transfer payment slip.  Oksana's  sister  said  that
    she was told by her bank  that  the  bank  does  not  keep  records  of
    accounts after six months.  That was why they did not have evidence  of
    the payment to Oksana's sister.

11.  The appellant said that the statutory declarations at pages  14  to  19
    of his bundle confirmed a customary marriage  ceremony  took  place  in
    Kenya on 28 July 2012.  The statutory declarations are from  his  elder
    brother, William Maina, his uncle and aunt and another couple who  were
    at the ceremony.  His aunt and uncle  in  their  statutory  declaration
    said that "the marriage was contracted in the appellant's homestead  in
    Kirinyaga, central province of Kenya where traditional marriage  rights
    were performed, dowry and drinkable paid subsequent to  which  the  two
    families were joined together and the couple were declared husband  and
    wife.  The appellant said that the  statutory  declarations  were  made
    before a Commissioner of Oaths.  They are accepted in a court of law in
    Kenya as proof that a marriage has taken place.

12.  He also said that the �100 he paid for the  dowry  was  not  the  whole
    amount.  The full amount was �150.  The remaining �50 will be paid when
    a baby is born to them.  Other things were  provided  as  part  of  the
    dowry and these were a front arm of the leg of a lamb which  symbolises
    a sweet and lasting relationship.  The lamb was provided by  his  uncle
    to him and Oksana but as they were not present, they were given to  his
    brother and his wife who represented them.  The appellant accepted that
    the prolonged nature of the dowry was not explained to the judge.

13.  The appellant said that he  and  Oksana  gave  consistent  evidence  of
    their relationship which was not given adequate  consideration  by  the
    judge.  They live in the same house and do everything together.

14.  Mr Deller submitted that there was a small curiosity in  the  grant  of
    permission.  The FtT Judge stated that the grounds were lodged  out  of
    time and no special circumstances making it unjust not to  extend  time
    have been  pleaded.  She  had  taken  the  merits  of  the  substantive
    application into account when deciding whether to extend time  and  had
    gone on to say that the application was not admitted.  However she then
    went  on  to  consider  the  merits  of  the  application  and  granted
    permission.   I  shall  disregard  the  confusion  and   consider   the
    appellant's grounds as if the application had been admitted.

15.  In reaching my decision I have considered the submissions made  by  the
    appellant and those  made  by  Mr  Deller.   I  fully  agree  with  the
    submissions made by Mr Deller.

16.  There was no independent evidence that  the  marriage  that  had  taken
    place in Kenya was recognised by the Kenyan authorities  and  would  be
    recognised by the authorities in the UK.  The judge took the view  that
    the statutory declaration from the witnesses and the  evidence  of  the
    appellant and Oksana Apanasevica was the  best  form  of  evidence  the
    appellant could produce.  There was  no  independent  evidence  from  a
    Kenyan lawyer or an expert in Kenyan customary law as to  the  validity
    of the traditional customary marriage and whether he could accept it in
    terms of the overall credibility of the appellant's claim.

17.  The appellant claimed in evidence that he was not bound by  the  Kenyan
    Marriage Bill 2012 which had not been implemented at the material time.
     He also said that the Kenyan Marriage Act 2008 had no  application  to
    him because he had married in accordance with  customary  law  and  was
    also not bound by  its  provisions.   At  the  hearing  before  me  the
    appellant relied on paragraph 6 of the skeleton argument that had  been
    submitted on his behalf at the hearing below. Paragraph 6 said that  in
    part V, paragraphs 42-44,  the  2012  Bill  addressed  marriages  under
    Customary Marriages.  The appellant said that the Bill was  to  address
    for the first time in Kenyan history,  the  issue  of  registration  of
    customary marriages in Kenya.  Section 43 states that the parties to  a
    customary marriage shall notify the Director of  such  marriage  within
    three months of completion of the relevant ceremonies or steps required
    to confer the status of  marriage  to  the  parties  in  the  community
    concerned.

18.  I note from paragraph 7 of the skeleton argument  that  under  the  new
    Bill, registration of customary  marriage  shall  be  done  within  six
    months of the marriage after completion of the  necessary  rituals  for
    the union and both shall appear in person before  the  Director  to  be
    issued with the certificate of marriage.  The skeleton argument goes on
    to say that unfortunately the  Bill  made  no  reference  to  customary
    marriage conducted before the Bill was passed, as is the  case  of  the
    appellant.  This is incorrect because Section  96(2)  of  the  Marriage
    Bill makes provision for the  registration  of  such  marriages  within
    three years of the coming into force of the Act.  There was no evidence
    before the First-tier Tribunal or before  me  that  the  appellant  has
    registered his  customary  marriage.   The  absence  of  such  evidence
    further undermines the credibility of his claim.

19.  In any event, the statutory declarations  are  only  a  bare  assertion
    that the appellant and Oksana Apanasevica got married.   The  appellant
    claims that his brother received the front leg of a lamb but that  does
    not appear in the brother's statutory declaration.  Furthermore it  was
    not evidence that was put before the judge even  though  the  appellant
    was legally represented.  There was no evidence  before  judge  of  the
    prolonged nature of the dowry.  It is not enough for the  appellant  to
    say that he did not expect that he would be questioned about the  dowry
    at the hearing.  He should have come prepared to answer questions about
    it since it formed a core part of the customary marriage.  In any event
    there was no proof that a dowry was  actually  paid  as  there  was  no
    evidence of the payment slip from Barclay's Bank or evidence  from  his
    sister-in-law or her bank that she actually received the money  and  no
    evidence from the bank in Latvia to  confirm  that  it  does  not  keep
    statements of accounts after six months.

20.   I  accept  that  the  judge  repeatedly  stated  that  the   appellant
    deliberately sought to marry under Kikuyu customary marriage rights  in
    order to circumvent immigration control.  When one puts that  assertion
    to one side, the fact is that there  was  no  independent  evidence  to
    corroborate the appellant's claim that a valid proxy marriage had taken
    place in Kenya which should be recognised in the UK.

21.  Aside from this is the matter of the  appellant's  immigration  status.
    I accept that the existence of Regulation 7 of the EEA  Regulations  is
    not contingent upon the non-family member of  the  EEA  national  being
    lawfully resident in a member State.  Nevertheless, the appellant  said
    that he met Oksana Apanasevica at the company where  he  was  employed.
    There was no evidence before the judge as to when the appellant entered
    the UK and whether he entered the UK lawfully.  The  appellant  however
    knew that he could not  marry  in  the  UK  because  he  did  not  have
    immigration status here.  He had therefore married by proxy with  total
    disregard for immigration control.  Such evidence inevitably undermines
    the appellant's credibility.   The  judge  was  not  satisfied  on  the
    evidence before him that the appellant was telling the truth and I find
    that he was entitled to come to  this  conclusion  in  the  absence  of
    documentary evidence to support his core claims.

22.  I find that the judge did not make an error of law.

23.  The judge's decision dismissing the appellant's appeal shall stand.
