                         DECISION AND DIRECTIONS


  1. This is an appeal against a decision of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  K
     Swinnerton, promulgated on 22 April 2016, in which  he  dismissed  the
     appellant's appeal against a decision to refuse to grant him asylum.



                          ï¿½ CROWN COPYRIGHT 2016





     Background


  2. The appellant was born in Charasyah, Kabul in 1998. On  4  July  2013,
     aged 15, the appellant arrived in the United Kingdom clandestinely and
     sought asylum. His application was refused  however,  he  was  granted
     discretionary leave  to  remain  until  1  July  2014,  owing  to  the
     respondent's understanding that he was born in 1997. Following an age-
     assessment, the respondent accepted that the  appellant  was  born  in
     1998. The appellant sought further discretionary leave to remain on 16
     June 2014, the refusal of which is the subject of this appeal.


  3. The basis of  the  appellant's  asylum  claim  can  be  summarised  as
     follows. He is of Pashtun ethnicity and lived with his mother and  two
     sisters in the family home in the Charasyab  District  of  Kabul.  His
     only brother had been killed in  a  bomb  attack  in  around  2011.The
     appellant's late father had been a member of the Taliban.   After  the
     appellant's father was killed while fighting for the Taliban in Logar,
     the Taliban forced the appellant to join them and ill-treated him.  He
     was able to get away from them with the help of  his  aunt's  husband.
     Thereafter  arrangements  were  made  for  the  appellant   to   leave
     Afghanistan. The Secretary of State rejected the appellant's claim  in
     its entirety on credibility grounds. Consequently, it was not accepted
     that either the Afghan authorities  or  the  Taliban  would  have  any
     interest in the appellant.

  4. During the course of the hearing before the First-tier  Tribunal,  the
     judge heard evidence from the appellant alone.  A  psychiatric  report
     was also submitted on the appellant's behalf along with other evidence
     including an  expert  opinion.  The  judge  dismissed  the  appeal  on
     credibility grounds as  well  as  concluding,  on  the  basis  of  the
     background  evidence  before  him,  that  it  was  unlikely  that  the
     appellant would be forcibly recruited by the Taliban. The  judge  also
     found that the appellant's mental state did not justify him  remaining
     in the United Kingdom under Article 3 ECHR and that  his  removal  did
     not breach his rights under Article 8, outside the Rules.


       Error of law


    5. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was sought  on  the  basis
       that it was arguable that the judge's assessment of  the  appellant's
       credibility was materially flawed  in  terms  of  characterising  the
       appellant's evidence as being implausible,  whereas  expert  evidence
       which was not expressly rejected by the judge concluded the opposite.
       It was also said that the judge failed to give adequate reasons; made
       no  attempt  to  apply  the  medical  evidence  in   evaluating   the
       appellant's credibility and in finding that the  appellant  could  be
       returned to Afghanistan where he could seek his family, the judge did
       not identify how the appellant as a minor could be safely returned.


    6. Upper Tribunal Judge Perkins granted permission to appeal on  7  July
       2016 on the basis that it was "reasonably arguable  that  the  First-
       tier Tribunal's approach to credibility is flawed. In particular,  it
       is arguable that the Judge made unwarranted  assumptions  about  what
       the appellant could be expected to know and failed  to  consider  the
       appellant's mental health when deciding if he was a truthful witness.
       It is also reasonably arguable that the Judge  failed  to  appreciate
       that the Appellant was a minor and that this error impacted adversely
       on her findings about the prospect  of  the  Appellant  returning  to
       Kabul."


    7. The Secretary of State's Rule 24 response of 21 July  2016  submitted
       that the judge directed himself appropriately. It was said  that  the
       judge was extremely careful to show  that  the  applicant's  age  and
       medical conditions was taken  into  account  at  relevant,  material,
       times.





      The hearing


  8. Ms Sane, initially, elected to rely solely on the grounds  of  appeal,
     drafted by her colleague Mr P Haywood, of counsel.

  9. For his part, Mr Jarvis argued  that  the  grounds  amounted  to  mere
     disagreement. He conceded Dr  Giustozzi  found  the  appellant's  case
     plausible in terms of the background material, however, he referred us
     to [25 and 26] of Y v SSHD [2006] EWCA  Civ  1223,  arguing  that  the
     judge's approach  was  in  accordance  with  the  conclusions  in  the
     foregoing paragraphs. Mr Jarvis emphasised that the judge took special
     care in relation  to  the  position  of  the  appellant,  as  a  minor
     throughout the decisions and reasons. Separate regard was said to have
     been paid to the  appellant's  medical  condition.   Specifically,  in
     relation to the first ground, Mr Jarvis  argued  that  the  judge  was
     entitled to say that the appellant should have known what was  on  the
     leaflets he claimed to distribute and this was  relevant  to  core  of
     claim.

 10. Mr Jarvis considered there to be no force  to  the  second  ground  of
     appeal.  This was because the judge found the appellant's claim not to
     be credible, including regarding  his  circumstances  in  the  greater
     province of Kabul. He argued that the appellant had not discharged the
     burden with regard to whether or not he had family  in  his  area  who
     would be able to assist him on return to Afghanistan.

 11. In response, Ms Sane argued that the judge failed to  adequately  deal
     with  the  medical  evidence,  which  emanated  from  the  appellant's
     community care team. She said that the judge had concentrated  on  the
     positive aspects of the  medical  evidence  and  erred  in  doing  so.
     Whereas, he had not engaged with the medical evidence which  supported
     the appellant's account of past trauma or given reasons for  rejecting
     it.

 12. While accepting that Dr Guistozzi's conclusions were  not  binding  on
     the judge, Ms Sane argued that the judge, nonetheless, ought  to  have
     explained why he disagreed  with  the  expert's  conclusion  that  the
     appellant's account of being targeted by the  Taliban  was  plausible.
     In addition, Ms Sane submitted that the judge unfairly criticised  the
     appellant's lack of knowledge regarding matters which he would not  be
     in a position to know owing to his  age  at  the  time.  Such  matters
     included whether or not his elder brother was a member of the  Taliban
     or what was contained in the leaflets he was distributing.


 13. In relation to ground 2, Ms Sane emphasised that the appellant was, at
     the time of the hearing and remained a minor and that  there  were  no
     adequate arrangements in place for his return, as  recognised  by  the
     respondent in the decision appealed. The judge erred in law in finding
     otherwise.


 14. At the end of the hearing, we  announced  that  the  judge  materially
     erred in law, that we set that decision aside and remitted the  appeal
     to be heard afresh,  with  no  findings  preserved.  We  reserved  our
     reasons.

     Decision on error of law

 15. First-tier Tribunal Judge Swinnerton made material errors of law.  His
     decision is set aside, in its entirety, for the following reasons.

 16.  The  credibility   of   the   appellant's   account   was   rejected,
     overwhelmingly, on the basis that it was  implausible  throughout.  We
     consider that the account the appellant provided of being targeted  by
     the Taliban following his involvement with an anti-Taliban  group  was
     not "so far-fetched and contrary to  reason  as  to  be  incapable  of
     belief." Y, at [26].

 17.  The  appellant's  account  was  considered  to  be  plausible,   when
     considered against the background situation  in  Afghanistan,  by  the
     country expert who provided a customised report for the appeal  before
     the First-tier. If the judge rejected Dr Guistozzi's  conclusions,  it
     is not apparent from the decision and reasons. The sole references  to
     the said  report  amount  to  occasions  where  the  judge  notes  the
     "comments" of the expert. Nowhere does the judge state whether or  not
     he accepts Dr Guistozzi's expertise and nowhere  does  he  assess  the
     expert's opinion. If the judge did not accept Dr Guistozzi's  opinion,
     he does not say so nor does he give any reasons for doing so.

 18. The judge's reasons for finding several  aspects  of  the  appellant's
     case to be implausible are inadequately reasoned.   For  instance,  at
     [104], the judge says that he does "not find  it  plausible  that  the
     teacher of the Appellant...would have  advised  the  Appellant  to  go
     along to  an  organisation  which  would  require  a  14  year-old  to
     distribute leaflets publicly." No clear reason is  given  for  finding
     that this teacher would not have taken this step. At [105], the  judge
     ventures into speculation in presuming what the  teacher  "would  have
     known" and stating that the aim of the teacher would "surely have been
     to protect him."

 19. At [106] the judge states that he does not accept that the family home
     was visited by the Taliban, that  the  appellant  went  to  the  Youth
     League and that he distributed  anti-Taliban  leaflets.  There  is  an
     absence of reasons relating to these matters.

 20. Again, at [107] the judge states that he did  not  find  it  plausible
     that the appellant would have been released by the  Taliban  owing  to
     pressure  by  local  elders  and  his  uncle.  There  is  no   clearly
     discernible reason given for his understanding of what members of  the
     Taliban would do if pressured to release a minor in its custody.

 21. The judge erred in paying insufficient regard to the medical  evidence
     before him in reaching his conclusions as to the  credibility  of  the
     appellant's account.  The  appellant  was  being  treated  for  mental
     illness by his  local  Child  and  Adolescent  Mental  Health  Service
     (CAMHS). He had  experienced  auditory  hallucinations  of  a  command
     nature which instructed him to take his life; he had  stated  that  he
     intended to self-harm and was diagnosed with  PTSD;  his  psychiatrist
     being of the view that this disorder resulted from his experiences  in
     Afghanistan. While the medical evidence is referred to  from  time  to
     time,  the  judge  did  not   adequately   consider   this   evidence,
     particularly given that it  provided  a  degree  of  corroboration  of
     aspects of the appellant's account.

 22. There is also merit to the second ground. At the time of  the  hearing
     and currently, the appellant is a minor.  The  judge  found  that  the
     appellant could be returned to Afghanistan at the time of the  hearing
     and could thereafter seek to contact his  relatives.  The  appellant's
     evidence was that he was not in contact with any relatives and he  had
     no positive outcome to his use of  the  British  Red  Cross's  tracing
     service. That evidence appears to have been accepted by the  judge  at
     [116-117] of the decision. These findings  regarding  the  appellant's
     return to Afghanistan do not acknowledge that he remained a minor, his
     specific vulnerabilities and the difficulties he might face in seeking
     to locate relatives in Afghanistan upon removal.

 23. In these circumstances we are satisfied that there are errors  of  law
     such that the decision be  set  aside,  to  be  remade.  None  of  the
     findings of the First-tier Tribunal Judge are to stand.

 24. We considered listing this matter to be heard in the  Upper  Tribunal,
     in view of practice statement 7 of  the  Senior  President's  Practice
     Statements of 10 February 2010 (as amended), however the appellant has
     yet to have an adequate consideration of  his  asylum  appeal  at  the
     First-tier Tribunal and it would be unfair  to  deprive  him  of  such
     consideration.

 25. Further directions are set out below.


 26. No anonymity direction was made by the First-tier Tribunal  Judge.  In
     view of the fact that the appellant is  a  minor  with  mental  health
     concerns, we consider it appropriate to make the  following  anonymity
     direction:

        "Pursuant to Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
    Rules 2008 (SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order.  Unless  the  Upper
    Tribunal or a Court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings
    or any  form  of  publication  thereof  shall  directly  or  indirectly
    identify the original appellant. This  direction  applies  to,  amongst
    others, all parties. Any failure to comply with  this  direction  could
    give rise to contempt of court proceedings. "


Conclusions


     The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did involve  the
     making of an error on a point of law.

     We set aside the decision to be re-made.
