Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms N Brissett (instructed by Aden & Co, solicitors)
For the Respondent:    Ms E Martin (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Secretary of  State  appeals  to  the  Upper  Tribunal   against  a
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal  (Judge Gibb) by which he  allowed,
    on Article 8 grounds, the Appellant's appeal against an Entry Clearance
    Officer's decision to refuse her entry clearance as a spouse.  For  the
    sake of continuity I shall continue to refer to the Secretary of  State
    as the Respondent and Ms Woldemariam as the Appellant.

 2. The grounds seeking permission to appeal argue  that  in  allowing  the
    appeal on Article 8 grounds the First-tier Tribunal  made an  error  of
    law, in particular in relying upon the case  of  MM  [2012]  EWHC  1900
    (Admin).

 3. The matter first came before me on 25th November 2013 and on that  date
    I decided the First-tier Tribunal had indeed made an error  of  law  on
    the basis that the Judge had applied MM incorrectly and  his  incorrect
    application of MM tainted his decision on proportionality as  a  whole.
    In particular he had taken into account  irrelevant  matters  including
    the fact that the Appellant was pregnant at the date  of  the  hearing.
    She was not pregnant at the date of decision and the judge had  further
    erred in looking at the best interests of a child not yet in existence.
    A foetus cannot have Human Rights.

 4. Ms Brissett wished to adduce additional evidence and so I adjourned the
    matter for a resumed hearing and gave directions.

 5. In accordance with  those  directions  I  have  an  additional  witness
    statement from the Sponsor  and  translated  documents  concerning  the
    Appellant's business interests and finances in Ethiopia.  I also  heard
    oral evidence from the Sponsor.

 6. It is only the decision under Article 8 that I set  aside.  The  First-
    tier  Tribunal's  findings  that  the  Appellant  could  not  meet  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules is without error and stands.

 7. The situation in this case is that  the  Sponsor  came  to  the  United
    Kingdom from Ethiopia in 1988 and claimed asylum. He was granted asylum
    and in 2002 granted  British  citizenship.  In  2005  he  travelled  to
    Ethiopia because his mother was ill and all of his siblings were either
    in the UK or the USA. Whilst in Ethiopia he met the Appellant and  they
    married in February 2008. The couple lived together in  Ethiopia  until
    the Sponsor returned to the UK in June 2009. The Sponsor was  therefore
    living in Ethiopia between 2005 and June 2009.

 8. The Sponsor then next saw the Appellant in June 2011 when  he  went  to
    Ethiopia and she applied for a visit visa. That  was  granted  and  the
    couple spent time together in France and then came to the UK in  August
    2011. The Appellant returned to Ethiopia in October 2011.  The  Sponsor
    and Appellant did not then meet  from  October  2011  until  after  the
    decision to refuse her leave to enter was made in December 2012.

 9. After the refusal, in March 2013, the couple travelled to  India  where
    the Appellant underwent IVF treatment which proved successful such that
    she is now pregnant.

10. This being an out of country entry clearance case the relevant date for
    my deliberations is the date of  decision.  The  date  of  decision  is
    December 2012 and at that time the Appellant was not pregnant.

11. The Sponsor works as a driver for Addison Lee private hire taxi company
    and it was established before the First-tier Tribunal  that  his  gross
    income is �12,000 per annum. That is �6,600 below the amount stipulated
    by the Immigration Rules. Ms Brisset, on the Appellant's behalf, relied
    solely on the authority of MM and in particular paragraphs 123 and  124
    of that judgment where Mr Justice Blake said the following:-

             "Although there may be sound reasons in favour of some of  the
             individual requirements taken in isolation,  I  conclude  that
             when applied to either recognised refugees or British citizens
             the combination  of  more  than  one  of  the  following  five
             features of the rules to be so onerous in effect as to  be  an
             unjustified and disproportionate interference with  a  genuine
             spousal relationship. In particular that it likely to  be  the
             case where the minimum income requirement is combined with one
             or more than one of the other  requirements  discussed  below.
             The consequences are so excessive in impact as to be beyond  a
             reasonable means of giving effect to the legitimate aim.


              The five features are:


     1) The setting of the minimum income  level  to  be  provided  by  the
        sponsor at above the �13,400  level  identified  by  the  Migration
        Advisory Committee as the lowest maintenance  threshold  under  the
        benefits and net fiscal approach (Conclusion 5.3).   Such  a  level
        would be close to the adult  minimum  wage  for  a  40  hour  week.
        Further the claimants have shown through by their experts  that  of
        the 422 occupations listed in the 2011 UK Earnings Index, only  301
        were above the �18,600 threshold[1].


     2) The requirement of �16,000 before savings can be said to contribute
        to rectify an income shortfall.


     3) The use of a 30 month period  for  forward  income  projection,  as
        opposed to a twelve  month  period  that  could  be  applied  in  a
        borderline case of ability to maintain.


     4)  The  disregard  of  even  credible  and   reliable   evidence   of
        undertakings of third party support effected by deed and  supported
        by evidence of ability to fund.


     5) The disregard of the  spouse's  own  earning  capacity  during  the
        thirty month period of initial entry".


12. Mr Justice Blake specifically declined to strike down the  requirements
    of the Rules as contravening the ECHR. Rather it seems  to  me  he  was
    saying that there would be occasions when it would be  disproportionate
    to exclude an Appellant who did not meet the requirements of the Rules.
    Since then the Upper Tribunal has given guidance in Gulshan (article 8-
    new rules-correct approach) [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC).

13. In this case I heard oral evidence from the Sponsor and I  also  had  a
    number of documents which indicated that when the couple met and at the
    date of  decision  the  Appellant   owned  a  thriving  curtain  making
    business in central Addis Ababa  which  provided  her  with  an  income
    equivalent to �2000 per month. Additionally, the couple together own  a
    three-bedroom villa in Addis Ababa which, if rented out, would yield an
    income of some �500 per month. It was argued that the  Appellant  would
    be able to secure employment in the UK as she is highly skilled. It was
    asserted by the Sponsor that when she had been  a  visitor  in  the  UK
    enquiries had been made with the likes of  Marks  &  Spencer  and  John
    Lewis with regard to her skills  and  both  expressed  an  interest  in
    employing her. I place little reliance on that assertion,  there  being
    no supporting evidence. It also seems to be an  unlikely  scenario.  It
    was also asserted that the Appellant had been one of the  best  wedding
    dress makers in Addis Ababa and she could continue to earn a living  in
    that way. Again, I treat  that  assertion  with  considerable  caution,
    there being no corroborative evidence.

14. The situation at the present time is that the  Appellant  is  in  India
    where she has been advised to remain because of her pregnancy  and  the
    business is being run by the five permanent and five part  time  staff.
    The Sponsor told me that he is maintaining his wife by sending �500 per
    month to her in India. He told me that she is unable to access her  own
    money from Ethiopia. I found that a curious statement when I was  being
    asked also to find that once in the UK the Appellant would be  able  to
    access funds from Ethiopia and yet whilst in India apparently cannot.

15. Based on the five features referred to by Mr Justice Blake  in  MM,  Ms
    Brissett argued that I should look  at  the  minimum  income  level  of
    �13,400 rather than  �18,600  and  taking  the  Appellant's  funds  and
    earning capacity into account find that the spirit  of  the  Rules  was
    met.

16. I should look at the evidence of  savings  provided,  namely  that  the
    Appellant herself had some �13,000 savings in an  account  in  Ethiopia
    and I should take into account her earning capacity.

17. On that basis Ms Brissett argued the decision to refuse entry clearance
    to the  Appellant  was  a  disproportionate  breach  of  hers  and  the
    Sponsor's  right  to  family  life.  She  argued  that  it  was  wholly
    unreasonable to expect the British Sponsor to live in Ethiopia with his
    wife as he had been granted asylum from that country and  his  evidence
    before me was that when he had been there between 2005 and 2009 he  had
    been targeted and harassed on account of  his  political  opinion,  his
    ethnicity and the fact that he is a committed democrat.

18. I dismissed this appeal for the following reasons.

19. Gulshan), referred to above, gives further guidance on the  Immigration
    Rules and Article 8. The Immigration Rules set out the requirements  to
    be met by someone seeking leave to enter or remain in the  UK  and  the
    Immigration Rules as a whole are a comprehensive list of those  persons
    who Parliament has decided should be permitted entry to the UK,  either
    temporarily or for settlement. The Rules themselves  contain  provision
    where a person can be granted leave to enter or remain  in  exceptional
    circumstances where they do not otherwise meet the requirements of  the
    Rules and those are to be found in paragraph X.1.

20. X.1, for present purposes provides (X.1.(b)) that if the applicant  has
    a genuine and subsisting relationship with a partner who is in  the  UK
    and is a British citizen, settled in the UK or in the UK  with  refugee
    leave  or  humanitarian  protection,  and  there   are   insurmountable
    obstacles to family life with that partner continuing  outside  the  UK
    then leave will be given.

21. Gulshan gives advice on what is meant by insurmountable  obstacles  and
    that it does not mean obstacles which cannot be surmounted as  that  is
    too high a test.

22. In the present case however obstacles, I find, barely exist at all  and
    it would not be unreasonable, let alone insurmountable, even applying a
    lower test, to expect this couple to  enjoy  family  life  together  in
    Ethiopia. I say so for the following reasons.

23. It is the Sponsor's and the Appellant's evidence that the Sponsor is  a
    highly successful businesswoman with what in Ethiopian is an  extremely
    high income of �2000 per month. I was told that figure  represents  her
    income; it is not the turnover.  Even  if  she  were  to  stop  working
    altogether I was told that the premises that the business occupies  are
    so valuable, being in central Addis  Ababa  that  they  would  yield  a
    rental income in the region of �2500  per  month.  Added  to  that  the
    couple already own a three bedroom villa in  Addis  Ababa,  which  they
    have built since they got married.  This  couple  can  clearly  live  a
    comfortable life in Ethiopia and I have no reason to believe did not in
    fact do so after the marriage and before the Sponsor returned to the UK
    in June 2009.

24. The Sponsor, although he claims that he cannot live in Ethiopia because
    he will be targeted and harassed, in fact lived there for a  period  of
    four years; he said to look after his sick mother. No  explanation  has
    been offered as to why that is no longer necessary.  The  fact  remains
    that he did in fact live in Ethiopia for a considerable period of  time
    and there has been no credible evidence that he  had  any  problems  at
    all. When asked to particularise the harassment he was  unable  to  say
    anything other than  that  he  felt  that  he  was  being  watched  and
    followed. I do not accept that he was in any difficulties in  Ethiopia.
    He has come and gone more than once. He owns  property  there.  He  got
    married there.

25. The simple fact is that  there  are  Immigration  Rules  (Appendix  FM)
    setting out what is required before  a  British  citizen  or  a  person
    settled in the UK can bring  a  spouse  into  the  country.  The  Rules
    themselves set out exceptional circumstances when those requirements do
    not have to be met and they are restricted. The Appellant in this  case
    falls a very long way from meeting the requirements of the  Rules.  The
    Rules require the Sponsor to have the money and he  falls  a  long  way
    short. If the Appellant has the means and wealth that I am told she has
    then it would be an easy matter for this couple to realise  her  assets
    and provide them to the Sponsor so as to bring  themselves  within  the
    Rules. They have chosen not to do so. The ECHR recognises the rights of
    persons to enjoy family life however it does not recognise a  right  to
    choose where in the world they  may  exercise  that  family  life.  The
    Appellant and Sponsor have in the past enjoyed family life together  in
    Ethiopia and there is no reason whatsoever why they would be unable  to
    do so in future or why it would be unreasonable to expect them to.  All
    I have been told is that the Sponsor regards the UK  at  his  home  and
    would like his wife to live with him here rather than he  with  her  in
    Ethiopia. That they are entitled to do if, and only if, they  meet  the
    requirements of the Rules. They do not. I find the  decision  does  not
    represent a disproportionate interference with their rights to a family
    life. Indeed, the couple were enjoying family life together in Ethiopia
    until it was interrupted by the Sponsor choosing to return to  the  UK.
    He has a right to live in the UK but that does not mean he has to.

26. The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is allowed such that the  decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal  is set aside as containing material errors  of
    law. I remake the decision such that the Appellant's appeal against the
    Entry Clearance Officer's decision is dismissed.
