                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


   1. This is an appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Murray promulgated on 26 March  2014,  allowing  Mr  Hussain's  appeal
      against the decision of the Entry Clearance Officer ('ECO')  dated  15
      December 2012 to refuse entry clearance as  the  fianc�  of  Ms  Kiran
      Iqbal ('the sponsor').


   2. Although before me the ECO is the appellant  and  Mr  Hussain  is  the
      respondent, for the sake of consistency with  the  proceedings  before
      the First-tier Tribunal I shall hereafter refer to Mr Hussain  as  the
      Appellant and the ECO as the Respondent.


Background

   3. The Appellant is a national of Pakistan born on 3 June 1990. On 2 July
      2012 the Appellant applied for entry clearance as the  fianc�  of  the
      sponsor: see  further  below  in  respect  of  the  history  of  their
      relationship. The application was refused for reasons  set  out  in  a
      Notice of Immigration Decision dated 15 December 2012  with  reference
      to paragraphs 290(i), (ii) and (iii) of the Immigration Rules.


   4. The Appellant appealed to the IAC. The sponsor gave oral  evidence  in
      support of the appeal.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  allowed  the
      Appellant's appeal for reasons set out in his determination.


   5. The Respondent sought permission to  appeal  raising  a  challenge  to
      Judge  Murray's  approach  to  paragraph  290(ii)  (although   wrongly
      specifying 281(ii)). Permission was  granted  by  First-tier  Tribunal
      Judge Grimmett on 13 May 2014.


Consideration

   6. In a clear and well set  out  determination  the  First-tier  Tribunal
      Judge identified the Respondent's decision, and the  reasons  for  the
      decision (paragraphs 1 and 2,) the available documents (paragraph  3),
      the relevant Immigration Rules, the statutory basis of the appeal, and
      the burden and standard of proof (paragraphs 5-7), before  summarising
      details of  the  hearing,  including  oral  evidence  and  submissions
      (paragraphs 8-12), and then proceeding to set out  his  findings  with
      reasons (paragraphs 13-18).


   7. At paragraph  18  the  Judge  stated  conclusions  favourable  to  the
      Appellant in respect of each of  the  requirements  of  paragraph  290
      disputed by the Respondent. As noted above, it is only in  respect  of
      the requirement of paragraph 290(ii)  that  the  Respondent  seeks  to
      challenge the decision.


   8. Under paragraph 290(ii) it is a requirement that "the parties  to  the
      proposed marriage or civil partnership have met".


   9. The Respondent had not been satisfied in  this  regard  because  of  a
      confusion apparent on the face of the visa application  form,  wherein
      at question 105 it was indicated that the Appellant had first met  the
      sponsor on 3 July 2007, whereas at question 109 it was indicated  that
      the Appellant had last seen the sponsor on 12 August  2000;  moreover,
      the evidence of the sponsor's  passport  only  indicated  a  visit  to
      Pakistan in 2000.


  10. On appeal it was explained that the Appellant and sponsor had  met  in
      2000 when the sponsor had visited Pakistan  with  her  mother  to  see
      family members. The sponsor was 10 years old at that  time,  as  would
      have been the Appellant. They stayed in touch by telephone after that.
      In 2007 the Appellant's father had spoken to the sponsor's father with
      a view to arranging a marriage between the Appellant and sponsor;  the
      Appellant and sponsor had thereafter communicated with each  other  by
      telephone and by Skype. (See determination at paragraphs 8-10).


  11.  The  Respondent's  representative  before  the  First-tier   Tribunal
      disputed that the nature of the contacts between the Appellant and the
      sponsor amounted  to  'having  met'  for  the  purposes  of  paragraph
      290(ii): determination at paragraphs 10 and 12.  The  wording  of  the
      'Respondent's   Guidance'   was   relied   upon.   The    Respondent's
      representative indicated that the guidance was derived from  case  law
      (paragraph 12) - although no case law was produced before the Judge.


  12. The Judge addressed his mind to  the  respective  submissions  of  the
      representatives, referred to the Respondent's guidance, made  relevant
      findings of primary fact, and against such an analysis determined that
      he was satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the Appellant  and
      sponsor had met within the meaning of the Rules: see determination  at
      paragraphs 14-15 and 18.


  13. The Respondent now seeks to challenge the Judge's analysis citing  the
      cases of Raj [1985] Imm AR 151 and Meharban [1989] Imm AR 57.


  14. The decisions  in  each  of  the  cited  cases  are  necessarily  fact
      sensitive. The decisions also significantly predate the use  of  means
      of communication such as Skype, wherein  it  is  readily  possible  to
      maintain an acquaintanceship following  a  physical  meeting.  (It  is
      unnecessary for present purposes for me to engage with  the  issue  of
      whether  contact  only  through  the  Internet  could  constitute   'a
      meeting', or whether a physical meeting would be  required.)  However,
      some general principles may be distilled from the case law -  which  I
      explore in the context of the Respondent's submissions.


  15. The Respondent relies upon Raj for the proposition that the parties to
      the proposed marriage should have "made one another's  acquaintances",
      and as such the meeting of infants as  young  as  3  or  4  would  not
      satisfy the requirements of the Rules. I do not consider that anything
      in the determination of Judge Murray falls foul of  that  proposition.
      The Judge found that the Appellant and sponsor had met and  spent  two
      weeks together at the age of 10, and  had  subsequently  corresponded.
      Implicit is that they had made each other's acquaintances.


  16. The case of Meharban applies the notion of  acquaintanceship,  it  not
      being disputed that there had been a physical meeting of  the  parties
      when 9 or 10 and 7 or 8 respectively. On the facts of that  particular
      case, when the applicant was interviewed he could not  recall  whether
      he had ever spoken to the sponsor as they were so young. The  Tribunal
      "rejected the argument that a mutual citing was enough to satisfy  the
      requirements". Something more was required than a "mere coming face-to-
      face followed by telephone or written contact". The Tribunal concluded
      "there is no requirement that the  parties  should  have  met  in  the
      context of marriage or marriage arrangements. However, the requirement
      that they should have met is a requirement which relates to the  claim
      to enter this country in order to get married, and  therefore,  it  is
      clearly related to the marriage. We think it should be interpreted  as
      requiring at least an appreciation by each party of the other  in  the
      sense of, for example, appearance or personality".


  17. Again, it seems to me that there is nothing overt in the reasoning  of
      Judge Murray that falls foul  of  the  guidance  to  be  derived  from
      Meharban. Moreover the Skype contact since 2007 would have provided  a
      further appreciation of appearance and personality following  on  from
      the time spent together as 10 year olds.


  18. I note that Judge Murray referred  to  the  Respondent's  guidance  as
      summarising the case law: "the meeting need not be in the  context  of
      marriage... If the parties were childhood friends, the meeting may  be
      acceptable, but a meeting of infants would not  be".  A  copy  of  the
      relevant guidance is on file: the Judge's summary is accurate, and  in
      turn the guidance is a fair reflection of the case law  now  cited  by
      the Respondent. As regards an Internet relationship, the  Respondent's
      guidance asserts that  such  a  relationship  without  a  face-to-face
      meeting would not satisfy the requirements - but on the facts that  is
      not the situation here.


  19. In all such circumstances I detect no error of  law  in  the  approach
      taken by the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  herein.  He  has  adequately
      directed  himself  to  the  relevant  principles  and  applied   those
      principles to  his  primary  findings  of  fact,  and  has  reached  a
      sustainable conclusion based on such analysis.


  20. I reject the Respondent's challenge to the decision accordingly.


Decision

  21. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge contained  no  error  of
      law and stands.


  22. The appeal of Mr Hussain remains allowed.
