Representation:

For the Appellant:      Ms L. Mair of counsel, instructed by Greater

For the Respondent:     Mr G. Harrison, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant, who is a citizen of Malawi, has been granted permission
      to appeal against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge  Cruthers,
      promulgated on 27 May 2015, by which her appeal against refusal of her
      asylum claim was dismissed. The essence of that claim  was  succinctly
      summarised by the judge at paragraphs 12-13 of the  decision  which  I
      reproduce but without stating the names of those  referred  to,  given
      that the appellant has the benefit of an anonymity order:


           "The appellant says that one "Uncle Joe" / Joe (K) arranged  for
           her to come to this  country,  ostensibly  to  study,  and  then
           forced her into prostitution. She says that she would be at risk
           of mistreatment / death at the hands of Uncle Joe  if  she  were
           returned to Malawi.


           The appellant also bases her case for remaining in the UK on on-
           going contact that her second son, (J) is said to have with  his
           Dutch national father (Mr KK) (the appellant's  own  account  is
           that her first son, (K), has never  had  any  contact  with  his
           father."


   2. The judge then went on to set out the key aspects of  the  appellant's
      account which, for present purposes, I can summarise as  follows.  The
      appellant's surviving parent died in 2004. Before coming to the United
      Kingdom on  28  January  2002  the  appellant,  having  completed  her
      schooling, worked as a receptionist for  a  while.  Although  she  had
      spent some time living in the capital city of Lilongwe when aged 12 or
      13, otherwise she lived with her father and relatives - an  uncle  and
      three brothers - in Blantyre.  The  appellant's  move  to  the  United
      Kingdom was arranged by Uncle Joe, who may have been a friend  of  the
      family rather than a blood relative, and he accompanied her.  She  was
      admitted with leave to remain as a student for 2ï¿½ years. However, as I
      have said, on arrival she was forced to work as a prostitute  and  did
      not undertake any studies.


   3. In 2004 she commenced a relationship with one of her clients who  took
      her to Birmingham where they lived together. In  May  2009  she  heard
      from a brother in Malawi that Uncle Joe had returned, had denied  that
      she had been forced to work as a prostitute and had threatened  to  do
      harm to her on account of the lies she had told about him.

   4. Her relationship with the former client came to an end in 2009 when he
      accused her of becoming pregnant by another man, which was in fact so,
      her child being born on 6 June 2009, his father also being  a  citizen
      of Malawi. The appellant had a short relationship with Mr KK and he is
      the father of her second son, J, who was born on 24  August  2011.  An
      attempt  made  last  year  to  register  J  as  a  Dutch  citizen  was
      unsuccessful and Mr KK, who gave oral evidence before  the  First-tier
      Tribunal, said that he was "too busy" to  make  a  second  attempt  to
      achieve this.

   5. In evidence, the appellant confirmed that she still has a brother, now
      aged 19, and a grandmother living in Malawi in  a  village  in  Mwanza
      district. She herself is not in  any  present  relationship.  She  has
      worked as a care assistant but said she would  find  it  difficult  to
      find work in Malawi "principally because things there have changed and
      the qualification that she has is not valid any more".

   6. Next, the judge recorded that it was accepted by  the  respondent  and
      therefore not in dispute that the appellant was brought to the  United
      Kingdom by Uncle Joe and exploited in the manner she described.

   7. Thus, the risk of coming to harm on return to Malawi was  asserted  to
      be at the hands of Uncle Joe. The judge observed, at paragraph  52  of
      the decision:

           "In relation to both  sufficiency  of  protection  and  internal
           relocation, the first point is that the  appellant  cannot  give
           any real indication of where Uncle Joe is now (or even if he  is
           still alive). On 18 May the appellant confirmed  that  her  last
           news of Uncle Joe came from a conversation with her  brother  in
           early 2009. The appellant also told me that when she came to the
           UK in 2002, Uncle Joe had been living in this country for  about
           10 years. It follows that Uncle Joe may well have settled status
           in this country and could be based in this country  (as  opposed
           to being based in Malawi/ Blantyre). Additionally, the appellant
           "escaped from" Uncle  Joe  back  in  2004  and  it  seems  quite
           possible that the appellant having left his household then  will
           no longer be a matter of interest to Uncle Joe."

   8. The judge then went on to consider the  questions  of  sufficiency  of
      protection and internal relocation, explaining why  he  was  satisfied
      that both provided a complete answer  to  the  appellant's  protection
      claim, should there be any continuing  interest  from  Uncle  Joe.  He
      noted country evidence before him to  the  effect  that  although  the
      government of Malawi does not fully comply with minimum standards  for
      the elimination of trafficking, it  is,  however,  making  significant
      efforts to do so.  Also,  the  country  evidence  indicated  that  the
      authorities were  willing  and  able  to  assist  "female  victims  of
      violence". The judge concluded:


           "Whilst... no state can 100% guarantee the safety from harm  for
           any section of its population, applying the "practical standard"
           explained by the House of Lords in Horvath  [2000]  UKHL  37,  I
           could not properly find that in Malawi there is  no  sufficiency
           of protection available to this appellant."


      He continued:


           "On the question of internal relocation, the appellant is  a  37
           year old woman without health problems. The appellant  does  not
           claim that her sons have significant  health  difficulties.  Her
           only claim bordering on that was a suggestion that (J) is behind
           in learning to speak. But it is not especially unusual to find a
           child of (J's) age to be behind his peers  in  general  when  it
           comes to speaking,  and  there  is  no  documentary  information
           relating to this claim."


   9. The judge noted that the appellant had spoken of Uncle Joe as being  a
      "well known person" she did not suggest that  he  had  any  particular
      power or influence in Malawi. She was not aware  that  Uncle  Joe  had
      previously had any  corrupt  relationship  with  the  authorities.  He
      found, therefore that:


           "... even if Uncle Joe heard about  the  appellant's  return  to
           Malawi and was interested in finding the appellant in a part  of
           Malawi away from Blantyre, there is no evidence to show that  he
           would be in a position to do that."


      The  judge  said  that  the  appellant  could  go  to  live  with  her
      grandmother and 19 year old brother in Mwanza, a village  in  Blantyre
      some 3 hours by bus from Lilongwe. He added:


           "Even taking full account of the appellant's difficult  history,
           I cannot find that it is unreasonable to expect  this  appellant
           to internally relocate with her two sons."


  10. For these reasons the judge found that the protection  claim  was  not
      made out.


  11. In respect of that part of the decision,  the  appellant  pursues  two
      grounds of appeal. The second of those  grounds,  which  is  that  the
      judge should have adjourned the hearing so that  the  appellant  could
      have a further opportunity to arrange for legal representation, can be
      disposed of relatively shortly. It is said that as this was a  complex
      claim, involving a victim of trafficking and the human rights  of  two
      small children, the judge should have "encouraged the appellant to try
      and seek further legal assistance".


  12. The difficulty with that ground is that there is nothing  to  indicate
      that the appellant was in any doubt at all  of  the  circumstances  in
      which she found herself and she had ample opportunity to take steps to
      arrange for legal representation. It is notable that the  desirability
      of seeking legal representation had been pointed out to her  in  clear
      and unambiguous terms. The decision under challenge  was  communicated
      to the appellant in two  documents.  A  three  page  letter  dated  25
      February 2015 headed "ASYLUM DECISION" concluded by  saying,  under  a
      heading "Your Asylum Decision - Refusal of Asylum":


           "This leaflet provides more information about your  claim  being
           refused and the options now available.


           If you have not yet taken  advice  on  your  position,  you  are
           strongly advised to do so now."


      The second document, which was longer, running to some eleven pages,
      was headed "DETAILED REASONS FOR REFUSAL" The very last statement in
      that document was in similar terms:


           "If you have not yet taken advice on your position, you are
           strongly advised to do so now."


  13. The appellant attended a preliminary case  management  hearing  before
      the First-tier Tribunal on 30 April 2015 when, as is  clear  from  the
      report sheet compiled by the judge who  conducted  that  hearing,  the
      question or representation was raised. Although it was  recorded  that
      the appellant had no legal representation, it is  apparent  from  this
      that on this occasion too the appellant was alerted to the question of
      whether she should arrange for  legal  representation  at  the  appeal
      hearing that was to follow. Finally, on 18 May  2015,  just  short  of
      three months after receiving the decision to refuse her asylum  claim,
      the appellant attended at the substantive hearing of her appeal. It is
      clear from the record of proceedings that the judge raised with her at
      the outset the fact that she was unrepresented and made clear that  he
      would take what steps he could to assist her in  the  presentation  of
      her appeal. The appellant made no application for an  adjournment  and
      nor did she say that she did not want the appeal to proceed while  she
      was without legal representation.


  14. Ms Mair submits that the judge erred in failing to "encourage her"  to
      seek an adjournment to provide  her  with  a  further  opportunity  to
      arrange for legal representation. I am,  however,  entirely  satisfied
      that there was no procedural irregularity on that account and that the
      judge did not in any way fall into error. Although it is true that the
      appellant was, subsequent to the appeal hearing, able to secure  legal
      assistance pro bono, there was nothing before the judge to suggest  or
      indicate that the appellant would be represented  if  he  declined  to
      determine the appeal listed before him and  instead  adjourned  it  to
      some future date.


  15. Ms Mair speaks of the case as being a complex  one,  but  the  summary
      above of the appellant's protection claim  does  not  sit  comfortably
      with such a categorisation. This was not a case where there had been a
      claimed risk of re-trafficking. Even now, as Ms  Mair  confirmed,  the
      appellant's case in respect of her protection claim is that she  faces
      risk on return only at the hands of Uncle Joe, not on the  basis  that
      she would be re-trafficked but because he would seek to do her harm in
      retribution for damaging his reputation by speaking of him forcing her
      into prostitution.

  16. Therefore that ground fails.  The  judge  made  no  error  of  law  in
      refusing to grant an adjournment that had not been sought.


  17. The other ground raised in challenge of the rejection by the judge  of
      the protection claim is also articulated as being  one  of  procedural
      unfairness in that the  judge  failed  adequately  to  scrutinise  the
      country evidence referred to in the refusal letter.  Ms  Mair  submits
      that had the judge scrutinised adequately the  country  evidence  that
      was available to him he  would  have  appreciated  that  the  material
      relied upon by the respondent related not to protection for victims of
      trafficking but was concerned with women who  were  victims  of  rape,
      sexual assault and domestic  violence.  Therefore,  the  evidence  the
      judge thought was available to establish a sufficiency  of  protection
      for victims of trafficking in fact was illusory and did not  establish
      that at all. Even if, by analogy, availability of  shelter  for  women
      and willingness and ability to prosecute offenders was relevant, it is
      plain that such assistance and protection was limited in  its  extent.
      Properly understood, she submitted, the country evidence  demonstrated
      that the government of Malawi relied  upon  NGOs  to  provide  women's
      shelters but provided no funding. That was not evidence of  the  state
      providing a sufficiency of protection.

  18. However, even if it were accepted to be an error of law by  the  judge
      not to carry out a more detailed examination of the  country  evidence
      before him for the reasons now put forward, that error  would  plainly
      not have been a material one. There was no question or expectation  of
      this appellant being driven to seek refuge on return to  Malawi  in  a
      Women's shelter or to have any anticipated  need  to  seek  protection
      from the risk of being re-trafficked. She had  available  to  her  the
      prospect of return to the protection of her own family in  a  familiar
      district of Malawi and there was nothing at all to suggest that  would
      not be a reasonable and safe relocation option, even  if  it  did  not
      precisely replicate the  arrangements  of  family  living  before  her
      departure.

  19. The reasons given by the judge for finding that there was no real risk
      of the appellant coming to harm at the hands of Uncle Joe on return to
      Malawi are clear, legally sufficient and  simply  unassailable.  There
      was nothing  to  suggest  that  she  faced  a  well-founded,  or  even
      articulated, fear of any other source of harm.


  20. For these reasons the grounds challenging the decision of the judge to
      dismiss the appeal against refusal of asylum fail and in that  respect
      the appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.


  21. However, the position is somewhat different in respect of the  grounds
      upon which the appellant challenges rejection  by  the  judge  of  her
      claim under article 8 of the  ECHR.  In  this  regard  I  am  entirely
      satisfied that the judge did fall into material legal error.


  22. The article 8 claim before the judge was one  that  required  detailed
      and careful assessment. The appellant, having been trafficked  to  the
      United Kingdom for the purposes of prostitution, has now been resident
      in the United Kingdom for 14 years. She has two young  children,  both
      born here and although she is not in any continuing relationship  with
      the father of either child, or indeed anyone else, the father  of  the
      youngest child, who is said to be a Dutch citizen, continues  to  have
      contact with his son and supported the appeal  by  attending  to  give
      oral evidence.


  23. The judge recognised that it was plainly in the best interest  of  the
      children to remain with their mother, who  herself  had  no  basis  of
      stay. He recognised also that:


           "It  is  probably  also  the  case  that  in  this  country  the
           appellant's children would have access to better  education  and
           healthcare services than if they were in Malawi"


      And that:


           "It also weighs heavily in the appellant's favour that  her  two
           sons were born in this country  and  have  never  known  a  life
           outside the UK."


      Despite that, he concluded:


           "But in my assessment, such factors as do tell in favour of  the
           appellant here are outweighed by factors  indicating  that  this
           appeal must be  dismissed  on  "classic  article  8  principles"
           including:


           It seems to me to be of significance in this case  that  if  the
           appellant and her children are allowed to remain in  the  United
           Kingdom, the UK taxpayer is likely, for the  forseeable  future,
           to need to pick up most of the  costs  of  their  accommodation,
           financial support, health care, education and so on."


      Building upon this, the judge said that although Mr KK was paying  ï¿½10
      per week as a contribution to the cost of caring for his son, this was
      "a drop in the ocean when it comes to the costs  of  housing,  feeding
      and educating a child in the UK", and he then said this:


           "Of course, such a situation arises very commonly in  the  cases
           of those seeking asylum, and those granted refugee  status,  but
           it has to be borne in mind that this is an appellant whose  case
           for asylum has been  rejected.  And,  as  Rix  LJ  indicated  in
           paragraph 49 of AAO [2011] EWCA Civ 840 22 July 2011, it is very
           unlikely to be a disproportionate breach of article 8 to  refuse
           leave to enter (or leave to remain) where an appellant  has  not
           shown  that  they   can   be   adequately   maintained   without
           [additional] public funds: "a requirement that an entrant should
           be maintained without recourse to public finds is an  ultimately
           fair and necessary limitation on what would otherwise  become  a
           possibly overwhelming burden on all of  its  citizens  (and  see
           Part 5A)"



  24. There are a number of difficulties with  that  central  plank  of  the
      reasoning of the judge that led him to reject the article 8 claim.


  25. First, reliance upon that dicta of Rix LJ was, in the circumstances of
      this case, simply misconceived.  The opening observations of paragraph
      49 of AAO, to which the judge had no regard, were these:


           "There is no question of a proposed removal in  this  case,  but
           only of whether the mother is to be given leave to enter. It  is
           hard to say that refusal of such leave is an  interference  with
           the exercise of the mother's right to  respect  for  her  family
           life."


      Thus the judge was simply wrong as a matter  of  principle  to  import
      into a removal case issues that arise in an entry clearance case.  The
      addition by the judge of the  words  "or  leave  to  remain"  was  not
      appropriate. This is evident from what followed:




           "However,  let  it  be  supposed  that  it  is.  (2)  Will  such
           interference have consequences of such gravity as potentially to
           engage the operation of article 8? Given  the  weakness  of  the
           family life in issue in this case, and the facts that the mother
           has accommodation, care and support from a  near  neighbour  and
           old family friend, medical assistance, financial support and  no
           life-threatening or debilitating illness, it is not possible  to
           conclude that the answer to this question  should  be  positive.
           But let it be supposed that it is. (3) Such  interference  would
           be in accordance with law, namely  pursuant  to  the  applicable
           immigration rules (subject of course to the ultimate outcome  of
           the  article  8  issue).  (4)  and  (5)   These   questions   of
           justification and proportionality are, as has been  said,  often
           taken together. I have no doubt that only one answer is possible
           to them, on any view of the previous  questions.  As  Strasbourg
           and domestic  jurisprudence  has  consistently  emphasised  (see
           above), states are entitled to have regard to  their  system  of
           immigration control and its  generally  consistent  application,
           and a requirement that an entrant should be  maintained  without
           recourse to public funds is an  ultimately  fair  and  necessary
           limitation  on  what   would   otherwise   become   a   possibly
           overwhelming burden on all of its citizens. It is an unfortunate
           reality of life that states,  especially  one  like  the  United
           Kingdom which is generally accessible and welcoming to  refugees
           and immigrants, cannot undertake  to  allow  all  members  of  a
           family to join together here, even those members  who  can  show
           emotional   and   financial   dependency,    without    creating
           unsupportable burdens."


      It can be seen that in this judgment the Court of Appeal was concerned
      with the particular dynamics of an entry clearance case  and  not  one
      where an appellant was facing removal. It might be  thought  that  the
      circumstances of this particular appellant, with 14 years residence in
      the United Kingdom and two young children who  were  born  here,  were
      about as far removed from those of the  appellant  in  AAO  as  it  is
      possible to imagine.


  26. That is enough, in itself, to establish that the approach taken by the
      judge to the striking of a balance between the competing interests  in
      play was legally and materially flawed. But he made  other  errors  of
      law also.


  27. The reference to Part 5 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act
      2002 suggests strongly that the judge  has  impermissibly  imported  a
      threshold test into his article 8 assessment of a  requirement  to  be
      financially self-sufficient. He assumed, without raising this with the
      appellant, that her ability to be economically active should leave  be
      granted to her would be no better than  it  had  been  while  she  was
      unlawfully present without leave.  Also,  there  is  absent  from  his
      assessment any real consideration of the living circumstances for  the
      children in Malawi, the judge saying this at paragraph 82:


           "And even though one can properly say that the best interests of
           the appellant's children probably mean that the appellant should
           be allowed to remain in this country, those best  interests  are
           outweighed by other relevant factors, including the  maintenance
           of proper immigration control..."

      That suggests that  the  best  interest  of  the  children  have  been
      displaced by the judge's flawed assessment of the weight to  be  given
      to his expectation that the appellant and her children  would  not  be
      financially self-sufficient. While it is clear from  s117B(3)  of  the
      2002 Act that it is in the public interest that persons who seek leave
      to remain are financially independent that is not the same  as  saying
      that the public interest requires the removal of all those who are not
      financially independent.

  28. Also, at paragraph 79 of the decision the judge  made  clear  that  he
      regarded the fact that the two children were "conceived at times  when
      the appellant would have been well aware that her  immigration  status
      was very uncertain" to be a factor that weighed in the balance against
      the article 8 claim being advanced. However, when considering the best
      interest of the children it is hard to see how that fact can  properly
      be regarded to be a negative factor.


  29. For these reasons, the decision of the judge to dismiss the appeal  on
      article 8 grounds cannot stand and will be set aside.  It  was  common
      ground and agreed between the parties that in the  event  of  such  an
      outcome the appeal should be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be
      determined afresh, even though the appeal on asylum grounds  has  been
      refused. That is because the appellant is now represented and  so  the
      case is likely to be agreed in a wholly different manner than  it  was
      advanced previously. Also, time has moved on  and  it  is  anticipated
      that there will be fresh issues  relevant  to  infirm  the  article  8
      claim.


Summary of Decision

  30. The appeal to the Upper Tribunal on asylum grounds (and in respect  of
      articles 2 and 3 of the ECHR) is dismissed so that in that respect the
      decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Cruthers is to stand.


  31. The appeal to the Upper Tribunal on human rights grounds (article 8 of
      the ECHR) is allowed to the extent that  the  decision  of  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Cruthers in that respect is set aside and the appeal is
      remitted to the First-tier Tribunal so that the appeal  be  determined
      afresh on article 8 grounds only.
