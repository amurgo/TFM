For the Respondents:   Ms A Jaja, Counsel, instructed by Howe & Co
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. For ease of reference I will refer to  the  parties  as  they  appeared
    before the First-tier Tribunal, namely that the Appellants are Mr Uttam
    Rai and Miss Yamuna Rai and the Respondent is the Secretary  of  State.
    An application was made by the Appellants to join  the  Sponsor,  their
    father, a former Gurkha serviceman, and the  application  was  refused.
    The  subsequent  appeal  to  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge   Veloso   was
    successful in that they succeeded under Article 8 ECHR.

 2. The Secretary of State mounted several Grounds of Appeal  all  set  out
    therein and permission to appeal was granted because it was  said  that
    the second Ground of Appeal was clearly arguable.   While   it  may  be
    said that the judge who granted permission did not make it wholly clear
    whether he was granting permission on the second Ground of Appeal  only
    it was accepted by both parties  before  me  that  that  was  what  was
    intended by the judge.

 3. The second Ground of Appeal was said to be  arguable  because  although
    the judge was considering Section 117B he stated that "the policy  does
    not  impose  any  employment  requirement".   However,   one   of   the
    considerations under Section 117B is whether or not the Appellants  are
    financially independent.  As such the grounds say that  the  judge  had
    not taken account of that consideration at all and  the  case  of  Dube
    (ss.117A-117D) [2015] UKUT 90 (IAC) made it clear that the Tribunal has
    to have regard to all the relevant considerations and  that  they  were
    not an "ï¿½ la carte menu" that is at the  discretion  of  the  judge  to
    apply or not apply.

 4. Before me Ms Ahmad for the Secretary of State said that the  judge  had
    not appreciated what was said in Dube.  The  judge  had  therefore  not
    looked at the relevant financial considerations.  The judge had  failed
    to take Dube into account.  There was therefore an error in the judge's
    approach and it was a matter for the Tribunal to  remake  the  decision
    given the facts that had been established before the judge.

 5. Furthermore it was said that although there  might  have  been  support
    from the witnesses the Appellants  were  not  financially  independent,
    which was a crucial factor in the assessment of the decision.

 6. For the Appellants Ms Jaja also relied on what was said  in  Dube.   In
    particular, at head note (2) it was said that it was not  an  error  of
    law to fail to refer to Section 117A  to  117D  considerations  if  the
    judge had applied the appropriate test. What  mattered  was  substance,
    not form.  In this case the judge  had  the  benefit  of  a  number  of
    witness  statements,  all  set  out  in  the  Appellants'  bundle.   In
    particular, there were the statements  of  the  Sponsor's  wife  and  a
    brother.  The statements made it very clear that  the  witnesses  would
    support the Appellants financially.  With reference to page 11  of  the
    subjective bundle under paragraph 14 of the statement from Dik  Rai  it
    was said that: "We confirm that we can  maintain  and  accommodate  our
    children in the UK.  My son Shiva Kumar is more than happy  to  support
    them.  He is currently serving in British Army.  My children  will  not
    be a burden on public funds."  There was a similar statement at page 13
    at paragraph 12 in the statement from Shiva Rai in that he was happy to
    support his father to sponsor and accommodate his siblings at any time.
     He confirmed they would not be a burden on public  funds.   The  judge
    had accepted this evidence as true and therefore the judge had properly
    considered what was set out in Dube and with reference to head note (e)
    of that case Sections 117A to 117D do not represent any kind of radical
    departure from or "override" of previous case law on Article 8.

 7. As such it was said that there was  no  error  by  the  judge  and  the
    decision should stand.

 8. I reserved my decision.

    Conclusions

 9. Section 117B (3) of the 2002 act provides that  it  is  in  the  public
    interest that persons who seek to  enter  are  financially  independent
    because such persons are not a burden on taxpayers and are better  able
    to integrate into society.

10. It seems to me that the judge's decision is faultless  except  for  the
    finding in paragraph 40 when she referred to  Section  117B  and  noted
    that the policy did not impose any employment requirement.   The  judge
    said no more than that and accordingly it seems to me clearly  arguable
    that this part of the judge's decision is  incomplete  and  that  is  a
    possible error of law.  However, as Ms Jaja pointed out, the judge  did
    accept the evidence of the witnesses whose evidence was clear that  the
    Appellants would not be a burden on taxpayers.  There is  no  challenge
    to the fact that she was entitled to do so.  What she could  have  said
    was that having accepted the evidence of the witnesses not only did the
    policy not impose any employment requirement but she did  not  consider
    that the Appellants would become a burden on taxpayers.   That  is  the
    clear and only implication of her findings that the witnesses' evidence
    should be accepted.  Given that, it can be  said  that  the  judge  did
    comply with Dube. It follows from that finding that there is  no  error
    of law, let alone a material error.

11. It follows that although the judge could (and should) have set out  the
    matter slightly more clearly in paragraph 40 there is no error  of  law
    and the decision shall stand.

Notice of Decision

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I do not set aside the decision.

No anonymity order is made.
