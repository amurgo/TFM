Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms E Griffiths, instructed by Bristol Law Centre
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Home Office Presenting Officer

This has  been  a  remote  hearing  which  has  been  consented  to  by  the
parties. The form of remote hearing was video by  Microsoft  Teams  (V). A
face to face hearing was not held because it was  not  practicable  and  all
issues could be determined  in  a  remote  hearing. The  documents that  I
was referred  to  are  in   the   bundles   on   the   court   file,   the
contents of which I have recorded. The order made is described at the end
of these reasons.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008
Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify the  Appellant  or  any  member  of  the  family.   This
direction applies both to the Appellant and to the Respondent.   Failure  to
comply with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellant is a citizen of Mexico born in 1980. She appeals against
the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Lever, promulgated on 23 October
2020, dismissing her appeal against the refusal of her protection claim on
asylum, humanitarian protection and human rights grounds.

2.   Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Kamara on 8
February 2021 on the grounds that the judge arguably erred in law in going
behind the Respondent's concession that the Appellant had demonstrated a
genuine subjective fear of domestic violence and there were procedural
errors in failing to raise matters which were ultimately relied on in
dismissing the appeal.

3.   Mr Walker conceded the judge's approach indicated he had gone behind
the concession which led to further procedural errors. It was agreed by the
parties that the decision should be set aside and the appeal remitted to
the First-tier Tribunal for rehearing.

4.   In the refusal letter, the Respondent accepted the Appellant was a
victim of domestic violence at the hands of her husband [XY] and that she
had demonstrated a genuine subjective fear on return to Mexico. The factual
basis for the concession was not made clear in the refusal letter and it
does not appear to have been addressed at the hearing before Judge Lever.

5.   At [9] of the grounds of appeal the Appellant submits that the
Respondent accepted the Appellant's factual account of domestic violence
including:

     (i) moving to/from the USA with XY;
     (ii)     XY's restrictions on her movement;
     (iii)    that the Appellant fled from XY on three occasions and was
found by him;
     (iv)     reporting XY to the police to no avail; and
     (v) threats made by XY to the Appellant since she left Mexico.

6.   Unfortunately, the judge fell into error because the accepted factual
account was not made clear by the Respondent. This resulted in procedural
unfairness because the Appellant, in reliance on the concession, proceeded
on the basis that her account was accepted. The judge went on the make
adverse credibility findings on matters which were not put to the
Appellant.

7.   I find that the judge erred in law in dismissing the Appellant's
appeal and I set the decision aside. The appeal is remitted to the First-
tier Tribunal. None of the judge's findings are preserved.

8.   I direct the Respondent to address the matters at paragraph [5] above
stating clearly which parts of the Appellant's factual account are accepted
and which are in dispute.

                                 DIRECTIONS

     i) The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be re-heard de
        novo by a judge other than Judge Lever. None of the Judge Lever's
        findings are preserved.

    ii) The Respondent to file and serve written submissions addressing the
        following matters by 4pm on 6 August 2021.

             a) stating the factual account upon which the concession is
                based addressing, in particular, the matters in [5] above;

             b) stating his position as to the country of return,
                specifically stating whether Peru is a proposed country of
                return and, if so, why.

   iii) The Appellant to file and serve any further evidence upon which she
        intends to rely by 4pm on 3 September 2021.

    iv) The appeal to be relisted on the first open date after 3 September
        2021.

     v) Time estimate 3 hours.

    vi) Spanish Latin interpreter required.
