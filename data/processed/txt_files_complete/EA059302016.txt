                           VIRGINIA DELA CRUZ PEREY
                          (NO ANONYMITY ORDER MADE)
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. On 26 January 2018 I gave the following directions:-

         "1.      In the light of Khan v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
         Department [2017] EWCA Civ 1755, the  First-tier  Tribunal  granted
         permission to appeal on the basis that it was arguably wrong in law
         to have concluded that it did not have  jurisdiction  to  hear  the
         appeal.

         2. The Upper Tribunal is minded to find an error of law, set  aside
         the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and remit the case  to  the
         First-tier Tribunal.

         3. A party who is opposed to this course is directed to inform  the
         Tribunal in writing (giving reasons), not later than  7  days  from
         the date this decision is sent by  the  Upper  Tribunal.  Following
         that period, the Upper Tribunal will issue its decision."

 2. There has been  no  response  to  these  directions  by  either  party.
    Accordingly, I am satisfied that neither party objects  to  the  matter
    being determined without a hearing and has nothing further to say. I am
    satisfied that that the determination of the  First-tier  Tribunal  did
    involve the making of an error of law for the reasons  set  out  above,
    and must therefore be set aside.  Given the  nature  of  the  error,  I
    remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal for a  fresh  determination
    on all issues.

Summary of conclusions

    1. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal did involve  the  making
       of an error of law and I set it aside.

    2. I remit the decision to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh  decision
       on all issues

    3. The appeal must not be before First-tier Tribunal Judge Shimmin
