                       (ANONYMITY DIRECTION NOT MADE)
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr N Bramble, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr P Saini, Counsel


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Secretary of State  has  been  granted  permission  to  appeal  the
    decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Andonian in which he allowed  the
    appeal of the respondent against the decision of the Secretary of State
    dated 25 January 2018 refusing him leave to remain in the  UK  on  long
    residency and human rights Article 8 grounds.

2.   For ease of reference Mr Mamoon Naseer  will  be  referred  to  as  the
    applicant.

3.   The Secretary of State refused the  applicant's  application  which  he
    made on 28 January 2016 for indefinite leave to  remain  as  a  Tier  1
    (General) Migrant because  his  self-employed  earnings  which  he  had
    declared to the HMRC for the tax  year  2010/2011  and  2012/2013  were
    significantly different to the  information  he  had  declared  to  the
    Secretary of State for self-employment.

4.   At an interview on 1 November 2016 with the Home Office  the  applicant
    said that he had sight of the tax returns which were submitted  to  the
    HMRC and signed them as he was  advised  to  by  his  accountants.   In
    respect of his self-employment for  the  year  2012/2013  he  had  made
    amendments prior to his current application  -  2012  to  2013  it  was
    ï¿½30,000 with amendments which he submitted before he made  his  current
    application for indefinite leave to remain.

5.   It was argued before  the  judge  by  the  HOPO  that  the  applicant's
    actions in declaring different income to HMRC and the Home  Office  led
    to the conclusion that in the light of his  character  and  conduct  it
    would be undesirable to allow him to remain in the UK and therefore his
    application was refused under the general grounds  of  refusal  and  at
    paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules.

6.   Counsel for the applicant below  argued  that  during  the  applicant's
    interview with the Home Office while his application was still pending,
    he had informed the Home Office about the amendments made  in  his  tax
    returns for the years 2010 to 2011 and 2012  to  2013.   The  applicant
    said due to complete trust he had in his accountants he did  not  check
    the tax returns before the accountants submitted them.

7.   The judge had before him a letter  from  the  applicant's  accountants,
    Rose Financial Solution, in which  they  stated  that  HM  Revenue  and
    Customs had agreed and accepted the amendment of the  tax  returns  for
    2010/2011 and 2012/2013 and  tax  liabilities.   The  accountants  gave
    their view as to what had  gone  wrong  and  so  far  as  the  previous
    accountants had handled the applicant's  tax  affairs  were  concerned.
    Rose Financial Solutions said that this mistake had nothing to do  with
    the applicant and he should not be penalised for it.  The applicant had
    said that there was no dishonesty or  any  intention  on  his  part  to
    deceive either the Home Office or HMRC.  The only mistake he  made  was
    to trust the chartered certified accountants and  any  lay  person  who
    does not have any knowledge of taxation  or  accounting  would  do  the
    same, it was submitted.

8.   The judge's conclusions are set out at paragraphs 40 to 47.

9.   Mr Bramble relied on the grounds which challenged the  judge's  finding
    at paragraph 41.  The judge held:

         "41. From the evidence that I have heard  and  from  the  documents
             that  I  have  read  typically  the  letters  from   the   two
             accountants, it seems to me that the appellant having admitted
             these errors, they were in fact innocent  mistakes.   Mistakes
             can occur.  They occur everywhere in our lives,  in  the  NHS,
             sometimes with fatal consequences, and in  public  life.   The
             appellant was not expressly challenged  by  the  Secretary  of
             State in relation to these mistakes, and all that was said was
             that it was his responsibility to make sure that the  accounts
             were signed off properly for the respondent and the HMRC.   If
             the appellant through his previous accountants  made  innocent
             mistakes then this does not constitute in my view evidence  of
             bad character and conduct or association.  The  intention  was
             not there to deceive in my view.  There was  no  intention  to
             act in that way.  If there  was  intention  that  would  be  a
             different matter and would  go  against  his  character.   But
             having  regard  to  all  the  evidence  I  believe  that   the
             respondent has not properly considered his guidance  notes  in
             that regard.  The guidance  states  inter-alia  generally  you
             must assess if there are cumulative  grounds  for  refusing  a
             person on character,  conduct  or  association  grounds  if  a
             person falls under more than one of the categories included in
             this section, or  there  are  other  reasons  for  considering
             refusal.  However, the person must be informed of the  reasons
             why their application is being refused  or  why  a  particular
             course of action for example deportation, is  been  considered
             or pursued.  It is not enough to simply  refuse  a  person  on
             character,  conduct   and/or   association   grounds   without
             explaining why."

10.  Mr Bramble complained about how the judge  considered  the  applicant's
    explanation and his conduct in this matter.  He submitted  that  whilst
    their grounds did not directly refer to R (on the application of  Khan)
    v SSHD (dishonesty, tax return,  paragraph  322(5))  [2018]  UKUT  0038
    (IAC), the judge failed to fully consider the  applicant's  explanation
    for the inconsistencies in his self-employed  income  which  the  judge
    recorded at paragraphs 15 and 16 and 17 of the decision.

11.  I accept Mr Saini's submission that Khan was a  JR  review  case  which
    has a different standard of proof  and  a  different  threshold  -  the
    question in JR cases is whether the decision of the Secretary of  State
    is open to him rationally.  Nevertheless, I find that  Khan  cannot  be
    ignored because it gives guidance on the approach that the Secretary of
    State should adopt in cases such as this.  The guidance in  my  opinion
    also assists judges.  In any event, paragraph 322(5) is a discretionary
    provision and what a judge is required to do is to decide  whether  the
    Secretary of State was right to  exercise  her  discretion  under  this
    provision adversely to the applicant.

12.  I was not persuaded by Mr Bramble's submission that  the  judge  failed
    to fully consider the applicant's explanation.  At  paragraph  41,  the
    judge noted that the applicant was  not  expressly  challenged  by  the
    Secretary of State in relation to the mistakes.  All that was said  was
    that it was his responsibility to make  sure  that  the  accounts  were
    signed off properly for the respondent and the HMRC. I find that it was
    open to the judge to find that if the applicant, through  his  previous
    accountants made innocent  mistakes,  then  this  does  not  constitute
    evidence of bad character, conduct or  association.   The  judge  found
    that the applicant's intention was not to deceive  in  his  view.   The
    judge  quite  rightly  said  that  the  respondent  had  not   properly
    considered his guidance in that regard and cited the  guidance  at  the
    end of his paragraph 41 and paragraphs 42 and 43.

13.  Mr Bramble relied on the Secretary of  State's  argument  that  it  was
    wrong for the judge at paragraph 46 to focus on the fact that HMRC  did
    not take the matter any further and  cited  Abbasi  JR/13807/2016.   At
    paragraph 46 the judge held:

         "46. The law requires the  respondent  to  be  satisfied  that  the
             applicant's income is from a genuine source or no points  will
             be awarded.  The respondent has already awarded the  appellant
             points  in  respect  of  his  previous  applications  and  the
             applicant reasonably believed having arranged an accountant to
             submit a tax claim that the  earnings  claimed  were  genuine.
             The applicant has submitted evidence of his current  full-time
             employment.  The applicant amended and updated the tax figures
             with HMRC and therefore the  Secretary  of  State's  enquiries
             should reveal that the applicant's tax records are  up-to-date
             with him and with HMRC.  I was also advised that the HMRC  has
             a long established process for  tax  amendments  because  HMRC
             understands  and  acknowledges  that  for  innocent   reasons,
             adjustments  may  be  made.   Unless  HMRC  has   levelled   a
             dishonesty claim in an individual case and levied  substantial
             fines there is  no  evidential  basis  for  stating  that  the
             earnings claim is not genuine.  The sole issue is  whether  at
             the time of the application the applicant  reasonably  thought
             that the earnings claimed where genuine.  I believe he did."

14.  Mr Saini submitted an extract of the HMRC Internal Manual -  Compliance
    Handbook.  This document states that each  tax  or  duty  has  specific
    rules on penalties for late payment or filing.  The penalty may also be
    due if the client does not tell HMRC about a liability to  tax  at  the
    right time.  Penalties can be charged if there are errors on returns or
    other documents which include understate the tax or misrepresenting the
    tax liability.  The document further states that if a client sends in a
    document that contains a mistake, HMRC will charge  a  penalty  if  the
    error is because of a lack of "responsible care", deliberate - such  as
    intentionally  sending  incorrect  information  and  deliberately   and
    concealing for example intentionally sending incorrect information  and
    taking steps to hide the error.  The level of the penalty is linked  to
    the reason why the error occurred.  Mr Saini said that the judge looked
    at the processes based on the HMRC Internal Manual.   The  judge  found
    that the Secretary of State had not established  that  the  applicant's
    earnings were not genuine.

15.  Mr Saini submitted that at  paragraph  47  the  judge  found  that  the
    Secretary of State has failed to discharge the burden of proof on  him.
    The  judge  found  that  the  applicant  had  submitted   an   innocent
    explanation.  He said the judge's decision was fully reasoned.

16.  I accept Mr Saini's submission and accept that the judge did  not  make
    any error of law in his findings at paragraph 46.  Looking at the  HMRC
    Manual, the HMRC could have levied a penalty against the  applicant  if
    they were inclined to do so.  Not having levied a penalty  against  the
    applicant, I  agree  with  the  judge's  decision  that  there  was  no
    evidential basis for stating that the applicant's claimed earnings were
    not genuine.  The applicant believed they were genuine and so  did  the
    judge.

17.  I find that the judge's  decision  discloses  no  error  of  law.   The
    judge's decision allowing the applicant's appeal shall stand.

No anonymity direction is made.
