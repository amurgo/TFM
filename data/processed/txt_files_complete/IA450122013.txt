                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. It is not entirely clear whether the appellant is a  citizen  of  South
    Africa or India but it is accepted he was born on 11 November 1985.  He
    sought documentary acknowledgment that  he  had  a  retained  right  of
    residence in accordance with Regulation 10 of the Immigration (European
    Economic Area) Regulations 2006.   The  material  requirement  for  our
    purposes is a single one and that it was  for  the  appellant  and  the
    appellant alone to satisfy the condition that "he ceased to be a family
    member of a qualified person or of an EEA  national  with  a  permanent
    right of  residence  on  the  termination  of  the  marriage  or  civil
    partnership of that person.  That required the appellant  to  establish
    that on 13 March 2013 which is the date that he was divorced  his  wife
    or former wife was a qualified person namely somebody who  was  working
    at the time.  The decision that was made  by  the  Secretary  of  State
    refusing  to  issue  both  a  permanent  residence  card  and  also  to
    acknowledge that he was  qualified  to  receive  a  retained  right  of
    residence was made on 17 October 2013 and  the  decision-maker,  having
    recited that there had to be evidence that the appellant's  EEA  former
    spouse was exercising free movement rights in the United Kingdom at the
    time of divorce concluded, having looked at the material  submitted  to
    him, that the appellant had failed to satisfy those requirements.   The
    conclusion was:

         "You submitted payslips from your EEA  national  sponsor  dated  in
         2007 which is  not  sufficient  evidence  of  treaty  rights  being
         exercised until the point of divorce".

 2. In the appeal before the Immigration Judge the situation  had  somewhat
    changed.   There  was  a  bundle  of  documentary  evidence  which  was
    submitted to which I shall return in due course.   However,  it  is  of
    importance to note  the  circumstances  in  which  the  judge  came  to
    determine this appeal.  He noted in paragraph 2 that the appellant  did
    not appear when the case was called on in the morning.  He said:

         "At the commencement of the hearing Mr Bhatoo of Messrs Riaz  &  Co
         Solicitors  appeared  before  the  court  and  completed  the  form
         required under Section 84 of the Immigration and  Asylum  Act  1999
         indicating that he  was  representing  the  appellant.   The  court
         record did not show a representative firm.  The appellant  had  had
         former representatives, AKL Solicitors, but they had  been  removed
         from  the  Tribunal  record.   Mr  Bhatoo  indicated  that  written
         authorisation to represent the appellant was not available  at  the
         Tribunal but was at his office.  I put the case back in  order  for
         that authorisation to be received."

 3. When the case was resumed at 2:20 in the afternoon at Taylor  House  Mr
    Bhatoo did not appear  and  instead  there  was  note  indicating  that
    another Counsel had been instructed but did  not  attend  for  personal
    circumstances and that Mr Bhatoo had been given the brief to  represent
    the appellant.  The note went on to say that the writer was aware  that
    the appellant was  not  attending  court  because  he  had  a  hospital
    appointment and an adjournment was requested.  It also stated  that  Mr
    Bhatoo had been told to withdraw in order to let the judge decide  what
    the appropriate course of action should be.  It is not in  my  judgment
    surprising at all that the judge in those  circumstances  proceeded  to
    hear the appeal.   The  only  firm  of  solicitors  on  the  file,  AKL
    Solicitors, had been removed from it.  The appellant  himself  did  not
    appear.  There was no medical evidence and all that was  suggested  was
    that the  appellant  was  not  attending  because  he  had  a  hospital
    appointment.  No details were provided of that hospital appointment and
    the judge recorded that he did  not  know  when  it  had  been  booked.
    However he delayed the preparation of the determination to  allow  time
    for a medical certificate or letter to be received from  the  appellant
    to explain his absence.  In fact, when the determination was signed off
    it was signed off on 28 April, almost a  week  after  the  hearing,  in
    which time there had been an ample opportunity  to  submit  documentary
    evidence to explain the bizarre proceedings which had taken place on 22
    April  2014.   No  explanation  was  provided   and   accordingly   the
    determination went out.  There cannot be any suggestion in my mind that
    the judge erred in law in proceeding  in  the  way  that  he  did.   He
    therefore was faced with a bundle of documents which ran from page 1 to
    page 37.  However, in  relation  to  the  single  issue  which  was  of
    significance to the judge and is of significance to me, there was  very
    limited material.

 4. First, there was a P60 or a series of  P60s.   They  related  to  Sarah
    Hafiz, the appellant's former spouse, from a company  called  Canvasbay
    Limited which indicated that in the year 2007 to 2008 the P60  revealed
    an income of �240.  In  the  following  year  with  the  same  company,
    2008/2009, her salary had increased to �10,146 and  in  the  subsequent
    year, 2009/2010, her employment with Canvasbay Limited had remained  at
    about the same level, it was �10,503.96 for the year ending  2010.   It
    dropped back in the year 2011, the P60  indicating  that  her  earnings
    then were �8,645.40.  None of  these  documents  however  assisted  the
    judge in deciding whether the appellant's former spouse was working  on
    13 March 2013.  The nearest he got to that  was  a  P60  for  the  year
    ending 5 April 2012.  This indicated a different employer identified as
    SI Clothing Limited of 24 Temple Building, Temple Road, Leicester.  For
    the year ending 2012 there was said to be an income  generated  by  her
    employment of �15,961.63, very close to �16,000 a  year.   However  for
    the year ending 5 April 2013 the material year in establishing  whether
    the appellant's former spouse was working on 13  March  2013,  the  P60
    indicated that her income  had  dropped  to  �4,271.10  for  that  year
    approximately a quarter of what it was before.  If her  employment  had
    continued at the same rate as it had done for the year ending 2012  and
    she had been working the same hours and at the same level  of  pay,  it
    would indicate that she had only been working for about three months of
    the year.  Of course it did not say which three months of the year  but
    if her employment had continued from 5 April  2012  it  would  indicate
    that she only earned for approximately three or four  months  and  that
    period of employment would have ended sometime in the summer  of  2012.
    It did not indicate that she was working on 13 March 2013, indeed quite
    the contrary if anything it indicated that her  employment  had  ceased
    sometime prior to 5 April 2013.

 5. There was however also a letter from SI Clothing Limited.   The  letter
    was described by the judge in paragraph 35 as being of  extremely  poor
    quality, it had been produced on an ordinary word processor, it is  not
    on headed notepaper, the formatting of the  name  of  the  company  and
    address are extremely uneven for an amateurish, it only  has  a  mobile
    phone number and no landline.  That is exactly correct.  I have seen  a
    copy at page 23 of the bundle and the parties have been provided by  me
    with copies of that letter and it is exactly as  the  judge  described.
    It purports  to  be  dated  24  January  2014  and  it  refers  to  the
    appellant's former spouse, provides a  national  insurance  number  and
    says;

         "I am director of S I Clothing Ltd confirm  that  Mrs  Sarah  Hafiz
         employed as machinist  from  07005-2011.   This  is  full-time  and
         permanent job."

    It is signed by a Director, Mr S G Patel.

 6. The reference to full-time and permanent job sits  very  uneasily  with
    the two P60s for the years 2012 and  2013  respectively.   If  she  was
    working full-time  and  permanently  in  2012  earning  �15,961  it  is
    difficult to reconcile that with a P60 dated  for  the  year  ending  5
    April 2013 where her earnings had  dropped  to  �4,271.   If  this  was
    indeed a full-time and permanent job since 2011 then no explanation  is
    provided for that.  So if those two pieces of material,  the  P60s  and
    the letter from SI Clothing Limited were the only material  upon  which
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge was required to reach a decision  he  was
    entirely justified in saying that he was not satisfied the  appellant's
    former spouse was working on 13 March 2013.  There is  something  of  a
    red heron in relation to the documents  which  were  before  the  judge
    because he accepted that the respondent's bundle had not been  provided
    but the respondent's bundle, it has  never  been  suggested,  contained
    documents which went to this issue.  It was for the appellant to  prove
    his case and to do so by proving evidence that his  former  spouse  was
    working on 13 March 2013.  The documents that he submitted  which  were
    entirely documents which he was in a position to obtain were  documents
    which did not support that position and nothing that the respondent had
    been provided with was  suggested  would  prove  the  case.   In  those
    circumstances,  given  the  absence  of  the  appellant  to  give   any
    explanations, the failure to provide any adequate medical  evidence  to
    explain his absence,  the  failure  to  make  use  of  the  opportunity
    provided by the judge for such evidence to be adduced later at a  later
    stage after the hearing, the absence of a representative at  a  hearing
    and the subsequent withdrawal of Mr  Bhattoo  when  he  had  originally
    appeared on the appellant's behalf entirely justified the decision made
    by the First-tier Judge that the  appellant  had  failed  to  meet  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules.  Inevitably it followed that the
    application for a residence card of  any  sort  including  a  permanent
    residence card was to be dismissed and no Article 8 claim could subsist
    in the absence of such a right to remain.

 7. My decision is that the Immigration Judge made no error of law.
