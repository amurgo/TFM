Officer
For the Respondent:    Mrs Javid, Solicitor


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State appeals against the decision of  Judge  Dearden,
    promulgated on the 16th March 2015, to allow  the  appeal  against  her
    decision to refuse the application of Miss Touseef Zahra for  leave  to
    remain as a Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)  Migrant  under  the  Points  Based
    System. I shall for convenience refer to the parties in accordance with
    their status in the First-tier Tribunal: that is to say, I shall  refer
    to Mis Zahra as "the appellant" and to the Secretary of State  as  "the
    respondent".

 2. The respondent refused the appellant's  application  in  the  following
    terms:

         'You have claimed 10 points for maintenance (funds) under paragrpah
         245DD(d) and Appendix C of the Immigration Rules but  eh  Secretary
         of State is not satisfied that  you  have  provided  the  specified
         documents to show you have been in possession of  sufficient  funds
         for the specified period, as  lid  out  under  Appendix  C  of  the
         Immigration Rules.

         You have provided a Lloyds Bank statement to demonstrate  that  you
         have been in possession of at least �945 of available funds  for  a
         consecutive 90 day period endning nor more than 31 days before  the
         date of your application.

         This document  does  not  meet  the  requirements  specified  under
         Appendix C of the Immigration Rules for the award of points because
         it only covers a period of 86 days.

         We have therefore been  unable  to  award  points  for  maintenance
         (funds)'

 3. At the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal, the  appellant  produced
    the  original  bank  statements  that  she  had  submitted   with   her
    application,  covering  the  period  between  the  11th  June  and  2nd
    September 2014. She was able to do  this  because  the  respondent  had
    returned them to  her  following  rejection  of  the  application.  The
    appellant also produced copies of additional bank statements  that  she
    claimed she had submitted with her application but the  respondent  had
    not returned to her. The latter covered the period between the 1st  May
    2014 and the 18th August 2014. They appeared to show that the requisite
    funds were available. The sole issue for  the  Tribunal  was  therefore
    whether the appellant  had  submitted  the  latter  document  with  her
    application. That question was posed and answered at  paragraph  13  of
    Judge Dearden's decision -

         "The question is whether  the  Appellant  also  sent  in  the  bank
         statements which again show a balance well in excess  of  �945  for
         the period  between  1st  May  2014  and  18th  August  2014.   The
         Secretary of State asserts that those statements were not  sent  in
         because they have not been returned  in  the  Respondent's  bundle.
         However when I am told by the Appellant through Mrs Javid that  the
         bank statements between 1st May 2014  and  18th  August  2014  were
         obtained by copying those in the solicitor's file that persuades me
         that the bank statements between those dates were in fact  sent  to
         the Secretary of State and for some unknown reason  have  not  been
         returned by the Respondent.  Essentially I accepted  the  Appellant
         as a credible witness.  When she says that the  statements  between
         1st May 2014 and 18th August 2014 were sent in to the Secretary  of
         State I accept what she says about that matter.   The  question  of
         the issue  date  was  difficult  to  resolve.   Whilst  Mr  Paramor
         maintained that there was a nefarious reason for the issue date  on
         all the statements being described as  "1"  I  do  not  necessarily
         conclude that such is the case."

 4. Thus, the sole issue was a  pure  question  of  fact  that  had  to  be
    resolved by reference to the evidence that was before the Tribunal.  It
    is not suggested that the judge did other than correctly direct himself
    upon the burden and standard of proof. Moreover, the grounds of  appeal
    do not suggest that the judge's finding  was  one  that  had  not  been
    reasonably open to him upon the  evidence.  One  might  therefore  have
    expected this to be an end to the matter and that permission to  appeal
    would be refused.

 5. However, in granting permission to  appeal,  Judge  Ransley  considered
    that it was arguable that Judge Dearden had erred  in  law  by  finding
    that the appellant was a credible witness  and  thereby  accepting  her
    evidence that the questioned  documents  were  reliable  without  first
    resolving the issues that were raised by the Presenting Officer. It  is
    true that, at paragraph 13 (above), the  Judge  to  some  extent  side-
    stepped the issue of the apparent anomaly concerning  the  issue  dates
    shown on the  copy  documents.  However,  with  due  respect  to  Judge
    Ransley, the question for the judge was not whether the documents  were
    reliable. Rather, it was whether the appellant had submitted them  with
    her application. Moreover, the documents appeared on their face to show
    that the appellant had met the requirement that she was  in  possession
    of funds amounting to at least �945 for a continuous period of 90  days
    ending not less than 31 days prior to  the  date  of  application.   It
    follows from this that if  those  documents  were  submitted  with  the
    appellant's  application,  then  the  time  to  have  questioned  their
    provenance was when refusing the application. The judge  resolved  this
    issue in the appellant's favour, and he cannot in my judgement be  said
    to have acted perversely or irrationally in doing so.

 6. The principal argument that the  respondent  actually  raises  in  this
    appeal is that the judge, "should have, at  least,  remitted  the  case
    back to the Respondent in order for checks to be  carried  out  on  the
    bank statements produced, and for the appellant to request a  certified
    copy from the bank" [paragraph 5 of the grounds]. However,  the  answer
    to that argument is exactly the same  as  that  which  I  gave  in  the
    penultimate sentence of the previous  paragraph.  The  grounds  further
    argue that the judge failed to conduct "a suitable balancing exercise".
    However, as Judge Ransley correctly observed,  the  judge  allowed  the
    appeal outright under the Immigration Rules. This  did  not  involve  a
    "balancing exercise".
