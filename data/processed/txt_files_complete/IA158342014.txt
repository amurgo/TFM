                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. This is an appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Chana promulgated on 25 July 2014, dismissing the  Appellant's  appeal
      against a decision dated 21 March 2014 to  refuse  to  vary  leave  to
      remain as the dependent of a Tier 4 (General) student  and  to  remove
      him pursuant to section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and  Nationality
      Act 2006..


Background

   2. The Appellant is a  national  of  India  born  on  29  May  1983.  The
      Appellant was previously granted leave as the  partner  of  a  Tier  1
      (Post Study Work) Migrant valid until 7 March 2014. This  was  on  the
      basis of his relationship with Ms Nazneen Shaikh (date of birth 29 May
      1986). On 5 March 2014 both the Appellant and Ms  Shaikh  applied  for
      variations of leave to remain: Ms Shaikh sought  further  leave  as  a
      Tier 4 (General) Student, and the Appellant sought  further  leave  as
      his wife's dependant.


   3. Ms Shaikh was granted further leave to remain from 21 March 2014 until
      14 April 2017. The Appellant's application, however, was refused  with
      reference to paragraphs 319C(i)(1), (2), and (3)  of  the  Immigration
      Rules; a consequent decision was also taken to  remove  the  Appellant
      pursuant to section 47 of  the  2006  Act;  a  combined  'reasons  for
      refusal'  letter  and  Notice  of  Immigration  Decision  was   issued
      accordingly.


   4. Essentially, the Respondent considered that the Appellant did not meet
      any of the pre-requisites to the grant of leave as the dependent of  a
      Tier 4 (General) Student specified in  paragraph  319C(i),  expressing
      the decision in  the  following  way  in  the  notice  of  Immigration
      Decision:

"Your partner is not a government sponsored student and is  not  undertaking
      a course of study with a sponsor who is either a Recognised Body or  a
      higher education institution. Your partner's previous leave was not as
      a Tier 4 (General) Student or Student. Your previous leave was not  as
      the partner of a Tier 4 (General) Student  or  Student  undertaking  a
      course of study longer than 6 months. As such, and fail  to  meet  the
      requirements of paragraph 319C(i) of the Immigration Rules."


   5. The Appellant appealed  to  the  IAC.  On  his  Notice  of  Appeal  he
      indicated that did not wish to have his appeal considered at  an  oral
      hearing and wanted it to be decided 'on the papers' without a hearing.
      He  paid  the  appropriate  fee  accordingly.  The   Tribunal   issued
      Directions on the basis that the appeal was  to  be  decided  'on  the
      papers'.


   6. The Appellant's Grounds of Appeal appended to  the  Notice  of  Appeal
      were in general terms. There was an assertion that the  Appellant  met
      the requirements of paragraph 319 C (i), without any particularisation
      or other detail. It was also asserted that "the Secretary of State has
      failed to have regard to the  Appellant's  unique  circumstances.  Her
      decision is contrary to the provisions of the European  Convention  of
      Human Rights Act", again without particular rising such  an  assertion
      any  further.  There  were  further  generalised  assertions  such  as
      'misdirection', consideration of the irrelevant and  an  exclusion  of
      consideration of the relevant, and a failure to exercise discretion.


   7. Pursuant to Directions issued by the Tribunal the Respondent filed  an
      Appeal Bundle. The Appellant forwarded documents for consideration  by
      the Tribunal under cover of letters dated 11 June  2014  and  13  June
      2014. The contents of the documents forwarded under the separate cover
      letters are  substantially  similar  save  that  the  latter  includes
      amplified Grounds  of  Appeal  (pages  1-11).  In  addition  to  again
      asserting that the Appellant met the requirements of paragraph 319C(i)
      of the Immigration Rules - (although again without any real attempt at
      particularisation or engagement with the requirements of the Rules)  -
      the amplified Grounds also included a submission based on the case  of
      Zhang  [2013]  EWHC  891  (Admin);  a   submission   in   respect   of
      'inconsistency'; and a submission pursuant to Article 8 of  the  ECHR.
      In this latter context in addition to the relationship with  his  wife
      it was identified that the couple had a daughter born in the UK on  27
      February 2014 (birth certificate at page 20).  There  was  no  witness
      statement from either the Appellant or his wife. Nonetheless it  seems
      to me that it would be appropriate to address any  factual  assertions
      contained in the amplified Grounds of Appeal on the basis that such  a
      document could be read as if it were the Appellant's statement.


   8. The First-tier Tribunal Judge dismissed the appeal for reasons set out
      in her  determination.  She  identified  the  nature  of  the  appeal,
      directed herself as to the burden and standard of proof, outlined  the
      basis of the Respondent's decision, and outlined the Appellant's  case
      as set out in the amplified Grounds Appeal. The Judge then set out her
      findings, from paragraph 8 onwards. She concluded that  the  Appellant
      did not meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules (paragraph 13),
      and also concluded that there would be no breach of Article 8  if  the
      Appellant were to  be  removed  in  consequence  of  the  Respondent's
      decision (paragraph 23).


   9. The Appellant sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal  which
      was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge White on 17 September 2014.


  10. Judge Wright granting permission to appeal essentially  on  the  basis
      that it was arguable that the Judge had proceeded on  a  misconception
      of fact so fundamental as to amount to an error of law. In  particular
      Judge Chana  had  concluded  that  there  was  no  evidence  that  the
      Appellant's wife had been granted variation  of  leave  as  a  Tier  4
      Student (paragraph 10). It appeared that she had done so by  reference
      to documents included in the Appellant's  Bundle  that  related  to  a
      person other than his  wife  (his  sister),  whereas  there  was  also
      included in the bundle evidence of the grant  of  leave  to  his  wife
      (page 18).


  11. It is not  made  overt  in  the  Appellant's  Grounds  of  Appeal,  or
      otherwise, as to why documents in relation to his sister  (and  indeed
      in relation to two further individuals) were included  in  his  appeal
      bundle. It may perhaps be inferred that it  was  either  or  both:  in
      support of the contention that he enjoyed a wider family/private  life
      in the UK than merely that with which he enjoyed  with  his  wife  and
      child; and/or, on the assumption that the two further individuals  are
      the  Appellant's  sister's  husband   and   child,   to   suggest   an
      inconsistency between the way in which the Appellant and his wife have
      been treated compared with a similar family.


  12. Be that as it may, it is clear on the face of the documents that Judge
      Chana was indeed in error in her approach to the  available  evidence,
      and as such reached a conclusion  based  on  a  misconception  of  the
      materials before her.


  13. The Respondent has filed a Rule 24 response dated 30  September  2014.
      The author of that document states that he does not have access to the
      documents that were before the First-tier Tribunal, and as such is not
      in a position to concede the appeal. However, it is acknowledged  that
      the Respondent's records confirm the grant of leave to the Appellant's
      wife, and accordingly "that the Judge may have misunderstood the facts
      in this case".


Consideration

  14. As indicated above, it is clear that the Judge misconceived the  facts
      in relation to the  grant  of  leave  as  a  Tier  4  student  to  the
      Appellant's wife from 21 March 2014 to 14 April 2017.


  15. However, this in and of itself is not material to  the  basis  of  the
      Respondent's decision under paragraph 319C(i) - which is rooted in the
      nature of the previous leave.


  16. It might be said, in such circumstances,  that  the  misconception  of
      fact is not material to the basis of refusal. In  this  context  Judge
      Chana addressed her mind to the requirements of paragraph  319C(i)  as
      specified in the Respondent's decision letter (paragraph 11).


  17. The error is, however, potentially material both  to  the  Appellant's
      submission pursuant to Zhang, and his case under Article 8. The  Judge
      did not engage with the submission pursuant to Zhang, and  as  regards
      Article 8 expressly took into account that on her  evaluation  of  the
      evidence the Appellant had not  "demonstrated  that  his  partner  has
      leave to remain in the United Kingdom or that she is currently in this
      country" (paragraph 17). Moreover, as regards  the  Appellant's  child
      the Judge found that what she considered to be "inconsistencies in the
      name of his partner" were such that she could "place  no  reliance  on
      [the] birth certificate to demonstrate that the appellant has a  child
      in this country" (paragraph 18).


  18. Moreover, although this is not a matter that has been expressly raised
      by the Appellant, it appears that the version of the Rules applied  by
      the Respondent was that  which  existed  prior  to  the  amendment  to
      paragraph 319C(i) from 1 July 2013 introduced by HC 244. As such,  the
      Respondent's initial decision was  not  in  accordance  with  the  law
      because it applied the wrong Rules.


  19. In all such circumstances I conclude as follows. The decision of First-
      tier Tribunal Judge Chana was in error of law in that it proceeded  on
      a fundamental misconception of fact. The decision  of  the  First-tier
      Tribunal is set aside  accordingly.  I  remake  the  decision  in  the
      appeal. I find  that  the  decision  of  the  Respondent  was  not  in
      accordance with the law  because  the  wrong  Immigration  Rules  were
      considered.


  20. In consequence the decision on  the  Appellant's  application  remains
      outstanding with the Respondent, and now requires to be determined  in
      accordance with the law. In doing so,  the  Respondent  will  need  to
      apply the correct version of paragraph 319C(i), and should  also  give
      consideration to the extent to which  the  decision  in  Zhang  is  of
      analogous application to the Appellant's circumstances.


  21. I make a fee award in my capacity as a First-tier  Tribunal  Judge.  I
      make a full fee award because the appeal is ultimately allowed on  the
      basis that the Respondent has not applied the  correct  Rules  to  the
      Appellant's application.




Notice of Decision

  22. The decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  involved  a  material
      error of law and is set aside.


  23. I remake the decision in the appeal. The Respondent's decision was not
      in accordance with the law and the appeal is  allowed  to  the  extent
      that the case is remitted to the Respondent to make a decision on  the
      Appellant's application in accordance with the law.

      To the Respondent
      Fee Award (This is not part of the determination)


      I have allowed the appeal, and in all of the circumstances make a  fee
      award in favour of the Appellant in the sum of �80.
