I make an order under r.14(1) of the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
Rules 2008 prohibiting the disclosure or publication of  any  matter  likely
to lead members of the public to identify the appellant. No report of  these
proceedings shall directly  or  indirectly  identify  him.   This  direction
applies to both the appellant and to the respondent and all  other  persons.
Failure to comply with this  direction  could  lead  to  contempt  of  court
proceedings.
I make this order because it refers to the appellant's three minor  children
and a fourth child who is disabled.
The parties at liberty to apply to discharge this order, with reasons.


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr A Ahbim of Cleveland Law Limited.
For the Respondent:    Ms K Pal, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, a national of Jamaica born on [~] 1986, has been granted
    permission to appeal against the decision of Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Thorne (hereafter the "judge" unless otherwise stated) who, in
    a decision promulgated on 2 August 2018 following a hearing on  9  July
    2018, dismissed his appeal against the decision of the respondent of 29
    July 2017 (hereafter the "Decision Letter") to refuse his human  rights
    claim in his representations  dated  2  May  2017  and  undated  letter
    received by the respondent on 22 April 2017. The Decision  Letter  also
    states that the respondent had decided  to  make  a  deportation  order
    against the appellant.

 2. Before the judge, the appellant claimed to fear persecution in Jamaica.
    The judge rejected the appellant's claim to fear  persecution,  finding
    that he was not a credible witness (para 45). The judge found that,  at
    best, his asylum claim was speculative; at worst,  entirely  bogus.  On
    these findings, he also found that the appellant  had  not  established
    his humanitarian protection claim or his case under Articles 2 and 3 of
    the ECHR. These findings were not challenged in the grounds.

 3. The  grounds  only  challenge  the  judge's  decision  to  dismiss  the
    appellant's human rights claim under Article 8.

 4. The Decision  Letter  states  that  the  appellant  has  the  following
    criminal convictions:

    (i)    On 24 February 2005 (when he was 18 years 11 months old), he was
         convicted of assaulting a constable and possession  of  a  Class  C
         drug (cannabis). He was ordered to pay  compensation  and  given  a
         conditional discharge.

    (ii)   On 11 December 2006 (when he was 20 years old), he was convicted
         at Snaresbrook Crown Court of possession of a  Class  C  drug  with
         intent to supply and four counts of possession of a  Class  A  drug
         (cocaine) with intent to  supply.  On  22  February  2007,  he  was
         sentenced  to  30  months'  detention   in   a   young   offenders'
         institution.

    (iii)  On 21 November 2016 (when he was 30 years 9 months old), he  was
         convicted at Wood Green Crown Court of possession  with  intent  to
         supply a Class B  controlled  drug  (cannabis)  and  possession  of
         another Class B controlled drug. On 22 March 2017, he was sentenced
         to 9 months imprisonment on each count, to be served concurrently.

 5. The first page of the Decision Letter states that  the  respondent  had
    decided to make a deportation order against the appellant under  s.5(1)
    of the Immigration Act 1971 because his presence was not  conducive  to
    the public good. The third page of the decision letter states that  the
    appellant's deportation was conducive to the public  good  and  in  the
    public interest "because [he had] been convicted of drugs,  which  have
    caused serious harm"  and  therefore,  pursuant  to  para  398  of  the
    Statement of Changes in the  Immigration  Rules  HC  395  (as  amended)
    (hereafter "Immigration  Rules"),  the  public  interest  required  his
    deportation unless an exception to deportation applies.

 6. It is clear that the convictions mentioned in the Decision Letter  were
    not the appellant's only convictions. The  judge  had  before  him  the
    appellant's antecedents, printed from the police  database  on  6  July
    2018 (hereafter the "PNC"). The appellant's  criminal  convictions  are
    set out in chronological order at para 48 below. The  PNC  also  states
    that a protection from harassment order was made by  Wood  Green  Crown
    Court on 5 June 2015 with an end date of 4 June 2025. The appellant was
    prohibited from contacting his brother, either directly or indirectly.

The applicable provisions

 7. No doubt the respondent invoked the  power  under  s.5(1)  because  the
    automatic deportation provisions in s.32 of the UK Borders Act 2007 did
    not apply. This is because the automatic deportation  provisions  apply
    if the individual concerned received a sentence of imprisonment  of  at
    least 12 months (s.32(2)) and the sentence was imposed on or after  the
    passing of the UK Borders Act  2007  on  30  October  2007  (Terrelonge
    [2015] UKUT 00653 (IAC)).

 8. Section 117A-D of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (the
    "2002 Act" apply to any assessment of an offender's human rights  claim
    if he is a "foreign criminal" as defined in s.117D(2), i.e. if:

    (i)    he has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment of at  least  12
         months; or

    (ii)   he has been convicted of an  offence  that  has  caused  serious
         harm; or

    (iii)  he is a persistent offender.

 9. Para 398 of the Immigration Rules also applies if  the  offender  falls
    within (i)-(iii)  above,  albeit  that  para  398(c)  uses  the  phrase
    "persistent offender with  a  particular  disregard  for  the  law"  as
    opposed to "persistent offender".   Both phrases  must  mean  the  same
    thing.

10. There are two exceptions to deportation in the case  of  a  person  who
    relies upon Article 8. The family life exception  is  provided  for  in
    s.117C(5) of the 2002 Act (Exception 2) and para 399(a) and (b) of  the
    Immigration Rules. The  private  life  exception  is  provided  for  in
    s.117C(4)  of  the  2002  Act  (Exception  1)  and  para  399A  of  the
    Immigration Rules. An offender who falls within para 398(b) or (c)  can
    rely upon the proviso  to  para  398  if  he  is  unable  to  meet  the
    requirements of the two exceptions. In that case, he would need to show
    that there are  very  compelling  circumstances,  over  and  above  the
    exceptions.

11. The relevant provisions are set out in the Appendix to this decision.

12. The judge found, at para 62, that:

         "62.     ... [The appellant] has in the past been  sentenced  to  a
             period of imprisonment between  12  months  and  4  years.  By
             virtue (inter alia) of his most recent offending, he is also a
             persistent offender who shows a particular disregard  for  the
             law."

Immigration history

13. The appellant arrived in the United Kingdom on 14 June 1990 at the  age
    of 4 years, in order to join his mother. On 26 July 1994 he was granted
    indefinite leave to remain ("ILR").

14. The appellant had had a previous appeal. This was an appeal against  an
    earlier decision to deport him, dated 11  July  2007.  The  appeal  was
    first heard before a panel of the First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Aujla and Dr J O de Barros).  This  panel  remitted
    the case to the respondent for reconsideration.

15. The appellant appealed against the reconsidered  decision  made  on  20
    December 2007. His appeal was allowed on human rights grounds  (Article
    8) by a panel of the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Cockrill and Mr C Thursby) (hereafter the "2008 Panel")  in  a
    decision promulgated 8 April 2008.

16. The judge summarised the findings of the 2008 Panel at para  5  of  his
    decision, as follows:

    (i)    The appellant used cannabis very regularly and  had  been  using
         cocaine since he was 17 years old.

    (ii)   The appellant has been in the United Kingdom a  very  long  time
         and all his meaningful ties are here. He has no  family  living  in
         Jamaica.

    (iii)  It is not in the interests of the appellant or of his  son  (C1)
         for the appellant to be deported.

    (iv)   The appellant "has learnt a good deal from his time  in  custody
         and has appreciated the major impact on his own and  others'  lives
         of his wrongdoing."

    (v)    The appellant "should be in no doubt  as  to  the  very  serious
         consequences for himself and  his  family  if  he  engages  in  any
         further criminal conduct."

The judge's decision

The judge's summary of the evidence

17. In summarising the facts of the appellant's claim before him, the judge
    referred to the appellant's past and present partners as "W1", "W2" and
    "W3", to his children as "C1", "C2" etc) and to the appellant  as  "A".
    To avoid confusion, I shall  use  the  same  terms  (no  disrespect  is
    intended), save that I shall refer to the appellant as "the appellant".



18. The appellant's private life claim was based on private  life  said  to
    have been developed in the United Kingdom since his arrival on 14  June
    1990 at the age of 4 years, in  order  to  join  his  mother,  and  the
    difficulties that he will encounter on being returned to Jamaica.

19. His family life claim was based on his  relationships  with  his  three
    children (C1, C2 and C3) by two women (W1 and  W2).  His  relationships
    with W1 and W2 had broken down by the date of the  hearing  before  the
    judge. At the time of the hearing before the judge, he said that he was
    in relationship with a third woman (W3) who has a son  by  another  man
    (C4) and who was expecting the appellant's child on 25 January 2019.

20. C1, C2 and C3 were born, respectively, as follows: C1 in  2007,  C2  in
    October 2010 and C3 in March 2012. C1 was 11 years old at the  date  of
    the hearing before  the  judge.  He  had  been  taken  into  care.  The
    appellant had not seen C1 for 5 years and last saw W1 in 2010.  W1  had
    remarried.

21. The appellant's relationship with W2 commenced in 2009 and  broke  down
    in 2016 because he had been selling drugs from  her  house  whilst  the
    children (C2 and C3) were present.  The appellant saw C2 and  C3  every
    weekend. His probation officer told him that he was permitted to do so.



22. The appellant's relationship with W3 (his  current  partner)  began  in
    December 2016. She is a British citizen. C4 was 7 years old at the date
    of the hearing before the judge (which means he was born in  2011).  C4
    was disabled suffering from global development deficiencies and saw his
    own father regularly. As at the date of the hearing before  the  judge,
    W3 and the appellant had never  lived  together.  His  bail  conditions
    required him to live at his mother's house.

23. The appellant's family life claim was also based on  his  relationships
    with his mother, his brother and his sister. A court  order  prohibited
    him from seeing his brother.

24. The  judge  heard  oral  evidence  from  several  witnesses,  i.e.  the
    appellant, W3, his mother, his sister  and  three  friends.  He  had  a
    statement from the appellant's step-father.

25. In oral evidence, the appellant  said,  inter  alia,  that  his  mother
    would, if necessary, go with him to  Jamaica  and  help  him  establish
    himself.  In oral evidence, W3 said, inter alia, that she  visited  the
    appellant in detention, that he was very close to C4 and helped  him  a
    lot and that she was unemployed  but  a  full-time  carer  for  C4.  C4
    received  Disability  Living  Allowance  and  she  received  a  carer's
    allowance. If the appellant were to be deported to Jamaica,  she  would
    not join him in Jamaica.

26. The appellant's mother said she was born in Jamaica on 24 February 1964
    which means she was 54 years old at the date of the hearing before  the
    judge. She had no family left living in Jamaica. The appellant was part
    of a close knit family unit in the United Kingdom. She had not been  to
    Jamaica since 2007. She does not know what has happened to her father's
    house in Jamaica. She financially supports the appellant by giving  him
    money. She works for a housing association earning �25,000 a year.  She
    could continue assisting the appellant financially if he were  deported
    to Jamaica.

27. The appellant's sister said she was very close to  the  appellant.  The
    appellant's deportation would cause upset to her and the  rest  of  the
    family. She was born in the  United  Kingdom  and  had  never  been  to
    Jamaica. She worked as a receptionist earning �22,000 a year.

28. The appellant's friends spoke highly of him.

The judge's assessment of the Article 8 claim

29. The judge assessed the evidence at paras 62-70 of his decision. At para
    70, he said that he had considered the decision of the  2008  Panel  in
    line with the guidance in Devaseelan v SSHD * [2002] UKIAT 702 but that
    it was of little assistance because it had been  decided  so  long  ago
    under a different statutory framework.

30. Paras 62-69 of the judge's decision read:

         "Findings of fact

         62.      After considering all the evidence I am satisfied  that  A
             has in the past been sentenced to  a  period  of  imprisonment
             between 12 months and 4 years. By virtue (inter alia)  of  his
             most recent offending, he is also a  persistent  offender  who
             shows a particular disregard for the law.

         63.      In relation to 399(a) of the Rules,  (and  the  associated
             statutory provisions) I make the following findings:

             a.   A  does  not  have  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
                  relationship  with  C1.  As  A  made  clear  in  his  oral
                  evidence, C1 had been taken into care and he  has  had  no
                  contact with him for the last 5 years.

             b.  A does have a genuine and subsisting parental relationship
                  with C2&3. I am willing to accept that he is their  father
                  and that he sees them every weekend. However,  it  appears
                  from what he said that this arrangement has  not  been  in
                  place for very long as social services were understandably
                  worried about his having sold drugs in  the  house  whilst
                  they  were  present.  Moreover,  I  have  seen  inadequate
                  evidence required  by  statute  to  establish  that  these
                  children are British citizens or that they have  lived  in
                  the UK for 7 years.  I  have  not  seen  copies  of  their
                  passports (or their mother's passport) or  heard  evidence
                  or seen a witness statement from their mother. I have seen
                  a letter purporting to be from their mother but I give  it
                  little weight as  it  stated  that  she  was  still  in  a
                  relationship with A when it was accepted by  A  that  they
                  were not. I  therefore  conclude  that  it  has  not  been
                  established that C2&3 are qualifying  children  under  the
                  rules or the statute.

             c.  It may be that A has a bond with C4 but I am not satisfied
                  that he has a genuine and subsisting parental relationship
                  with C4 for the purposes of the Rules or  statute.  He  is
                  not the biological father and has  not  stepped  into  the
                  shoes of C4's natural father. C4's biological father still
                  plays  an  important  role  in  his  life  and  sees   him
                  regularly.

         64.      Even if I am wrong about my  analysis  set  out  above  in
             relation to C2, 3 & 4, I conclude that it would not be  unduly
             harsh for these children to remain in the UK without  A.  C2&3
             live with their mother and see A only once a  week.  C4  lives
             with his mother and sees his own father regularly. Moreover  A
             does not live with C4 and his mother.

         65.      I also conclude that it is in the best interests of C1  to
             remain as he has been for the last 5  years  with  no  contact
             with A. I also conclude that it is in the  best  interests  of
             C2&3 and 4 to remain with their  respective  mothers.  However
             even if I am wrong about this and it is in the best  interests
             of these various children to  have  A  playing  some  sort  of
             continuing or future role in  their  lives,  I  conclude  that
             their interests are  outweighed  by  the  public  interest  in
             deporting foreign criminals.

         66.      In relation to 399(b) of the Rules,  (and  the  associated
             statutory provisions) I make the following findings:

             a.  A  does  not  claim  to  have  a  genuine  and  subsisting
                  relationship with W1, 2 or 3.

             b.  In relation to W4, it has not been established that she is
                  his partner as defined  under  the  Rules.  They  are  not
                  married and have not lived together  for  a  period  of  2
                  years. In fact they have never lived together.

             c.  In any event even if W4 is A's partner, I conclude that it
                  has not been established that it would be unduly harsh for
                  W4 to remain in the UK without A. She is a British citizen
                  as is her son. They can obtain assistance from  the  state
                  to help look after C4. In  addition  C4's  natural  father
                  lives in the UK and continues to play and [sic]  important
                  role in his life.

         67.      In relation to 399A of  the  Rules,  (and  the  associated
             statutory provisions) I make the following findings:

             a.  I accept that A has been lawfully resident in the  UK  for
                  most of his life.

             b.   However,  I  do  not  accept  that  he  is  socially  and
                  culturally integrated  in  the  UK.  He  is  a  persistent
                  offender who despite being given a chance by the  Tribunal
                  on the last occasion a deportation order was made  against
                  him and after promising that he was a reformed  character,
                  nonetheless re-offended by selling drugs.

             c.  In addition it has not been established that  there  would
                  be very significant  obstacles  to  his  integration  into
                  Jamaica. He  is  a  citizen  of  Jamaica  who  speaks  the
                  language of that country. He is a fit young man. There  is
                  inadequate evidence to establish that he would not be able
                  to find employment and accommodation in Jamaica  or  would
                  not be able to  call  upon  the  emotional  and  financial
                  assistance of his family in the UK  to  help  him  in  the
                  early stages of his integration into Jamaica. For  reasons
                  given above I also conclude that he  is  not  at  risk  of
                  persecution or harm in that country.

         68.      In light of all of  the  aforesaid  findings  therefore  I
             conclude that A  does  not  benefit  from  the  exceptions  to
             deportation contained in the Immigration Rules. Therefore  the
             next question is whether  A  has  established  that  his  case
             exhibits very  compelling  circumstances  which  outweigh  the
             public interest in deportation. The case law  above  makes  it
             clear that "the scales  are  heavily  weighted  in  favour  of
             deportation and  something  very  compelling  (which  will  be
             'exceptional') is required to outweigh the public interest  in
             removal."

         69.       By  reference  to  s.117(b)  of  the  statute,  there  is
             inadequate evidence that A is able to financially provide  for
             himself in the UK. I  accept  that  he  has  no  relatives  in
             Jamaica,  but  for  reasons  given  above  it  has  not   been
             established that there would be very significant obstacles  to
             his integration into Jamaica. Moreover although he may have  a
             relationship with a number of his own and other's children  in
             the UK and has a relationship with W4, I conclude  that  these
             do not constitute an exemption to deportation under the Rules.
             I also conclude that there is nothing in the nature  of  these
             relationships which constitute very  compelling  circumstances
             which outweigh the public interest in removal."

31. At paras 66.b and c, the judge was plainly referring to  "W3"  and  not
    "W4", since he did not assign "W4" to anyone.

The grounds

32. There are four grounds. However, there  are  two  separate  aspects  to
    ground 3, which I have called "ground 3.a" and "ground 3.b".

33. In summary, the grounds are:

    (i)    (Ground 1) The judge's finding at para 62 that the appellant  is
         a persistent offender who has shown a particular disregard for  the
         law was irrational, given that the appellant's convictions were  11
         years apart and in light of para 26 of Court of  Appeal's  judgment
         in SC (Zimbabwe) v SSHD [2018] EWCA  Civ  929  which  rejected  the
         submission made on the Secretary of State's behalf that the  status
         of "persistent offender" once acquired can never be lost and  that,
         in applying s.117D(2)(c) of the 2002 Act a court  or  tribunal  was
         required to  attribute  significant  weight  to  the  Secretary  of
         State's view.

    (ii)   (Ground 2) The judge materially erred in law in his approach  to
         the welfare of the appellant's children. In particular:

         (a)      He failed to make any adequate findings  as  to  the  best
             interests of the appellant's children.

         (b)      In the alternative, he failed to take into account factors
             relevant to the  assessment  of  the  best  interests  of  the
             children and consequently in  assessing  proportionality.  The
             judge was required to discharge his duty  to  treat  the  best
             interests  of  the   appellant's   children   as   a   primary
             consideration and to consider their human rights in  substance
             and not merely in form.

    (iii)  (Ground 3.a) The judge materially erred in law in his assessment
         of the appellant's private life claim. The appellant is  a  32-year
         old who has lived in the United Kingdom for over 28  years,  having
         arrived at the age of 4 years from Jamaica. He was granted  ILR  in
         July 1994. He has never left the  United  Kingdom.   He  has  never
         maintained any ties in Jamaica and has no social or  cultural  ties
         with Jamaica.

    (iv)    (Ground  3.b)  The  judge  failed  to  consider   whether   the
         appellant's children were British by birth under s.1 of the British
         Nationality Act 1981 as biological children of a man  with  settled
         status.

    (v)    (Ground 4) The judge failed to consider the  entire  facts  that
         were before him and apply  the  "current  jurisprudence".  In  this
         regard, ground 4 proceeds to quote para 12 of  EB  (Kosovo)  [2008]
         UKH 41 which passage (the grounds state) was quoted and applied  by
         Sedley LJ in VW (Uganda) v SSHD [2009] EWCA Civ 5.  In  particular,
         the grounds rely upon the passages to the effect that:

             "... the material question in gauging the proportionality of a
             removal or deportation which will or may  break  up  a  family
             unless the family itself decamps is not whether  there  is  an
             insuperable obstacle to  this  happening  but  whether  it  is
             reasonable to expect the family to leave with  the  appellant"
             (para 24 of VW (Uganda))

    In view of this "current jurisprudence",  ground  4  contends  that  it
    would be wholly unreasonable to expect appellant to return to  Jamaica.
    The judge's decision was inadequately reasoned and perverse.

    When one considers the passages quoted at paras 21-23 of  the  grounds,
    it is clear that the crux of ground 4 is that it  is  unreasonable  for
    family life to be enjoyed in Jamaica between the appellant and W3.



Submissions

34. In relation to ground 1, Mr Ahbim submitted that, given that there  was
    a gap of 11 years between the appellant's first conviction and his most
    recent conviction,  the  judge's  finding  that  the  appellant  was  a
    persistent offender was irrational. Although he accepted that the judge
    also found that the appellant had in  the  past  been  sentenced  to  a
    period of imprisonment between 12 months and 4 years, he submitted that
    the error in finding that the appellant was a persistent  offender  was
    material.

35. In relation to ground 2, I asked  Mr  Ahbim  what  evidence  there  was
    before the judge of the impact  on  the  appellant's  children  of  his
    deportation. Mr Ahbim submitted that  the  judge  had  found  that  the
    appellant had a very close relationship with his children and that  the
    children would be devastated. I then asked Mr Ahbim to take me  to  the
    judge's decision and draw my  attention  to  such  findings.  Mr  Ahbim
    referred me to para 63 of the judge's decision but  I  noted  that  the
    judge did not make the findings contended by Mr Ahbim at para 63.

36. Mr Ahbim then submitted that it would not be in the best  interests  of
    the appellant's children if  he  were  to  be  deported.  It  would  be
    preferable for the children to have both parents in the United Kingdom.
    He submitted that the judge did not attach  sufficient  weight  to  the
    parental relationship between  the  appellant  and  his  children.  His
    removal would end the parental relationship.

37. I asked Mr Ahbim again whether there was any evidence before the  judge
    of the impact on the children of the appellant's deportation. Mr  Ahbim
    accepted that there was no report from any social worker  but  he  said
    that the judge had heard oral evidence. I noted that  the  grounds  did
    not contend that there was oral evidence before the judge of the impact
    on the children. I also noted the judge's summary of the oral evidence,
    at paras 11-22 of his decision. At para 16, he  recorded  that  W3  had
    given evidence that C4 was very close to the  appellant  and  that  the
    appellant helped her a lot with C4. At para 20, he  recorded  that  the
    appellant's sister had said that deportation would cause upset  to  her
    and her family.

38. In relation to ground 2, Mr Ahbim relied upon s.117B(6) of the 2002 Act
     which he submitted applies in deportation cases.

39. In relation to ground 3.a, Mr Ahbim submitted that the judge's  finding
    that the appellant was  not  socially  and  culturally  integrated  was
    irrational, given that the appellant had lived in  the  United  Kingdom
    since the age of 4 years and was now 32 years old.

40. When I pointed out that the judge's finding that the appellant was  not
    socially and culturally  integrated  in  the  United  Kingdom  was  not
    challenged in terms  in  the  grounds,  Mr  Ahbim  submitted  that  the
    intention of ground 3 was to contend that the appellant was  culturally
    and socially integrated in the United Kingdom and that he had  no  ties
    in Jamaica having left Jamaica at the age of 4 years.

41. In relation to ground 3.b, the judge had accepted  that  the  appellant
    had been granted ILR in 1994 and yet said that the  appellant  had  not
    established that his three children were British citizens.

42. In relation to ground 4, Mr Ahbim submitted that the judge  had  failed
    to place sufficient weight on the appellant's length  of  residence  in
    the United Kingdom since the age  of  4  years  and  that  the  judge's
    decision was irrational because the appellant had no ties to Jamaica.

43. I heard briefly from Ms Pal.

44. In response to Ms  Pal's  submissions,  Mr  Ahbim  submitted  that  the
    judge's finding that there would not be very significant  obstacles  to
    the appellant's reintegration in Jamaica was irrational, given that the
    appellant had no ties in Jamaica  and  would  have  difficulty  finding
    accommodation and employment, notwithstanding the fact that  he  speaks
    English which is also spoken in Jamaica.

45. Mr Ahbim submitted that the judge's finding at para 68, that there were
    no very  compelling  circumstances  over  and  above  Exception  1  and
    Exception 2 as provided  for  in  s.117D,  was  irrational,  given  the
    factors that were in the appellant's favour, in particular, that he had
    arrived in the United Kingdom at the age of 4 years. The  compassionate
    circumstance was that the appellant had no ties to Jamaica which  is  a
    foreign country to  him.  The  judge  erred  when  he  found  that  the
    appellant's compassionate circumstances did  not  outweigh  the  public
    interest.

46. I reserved my decision.

Assessment

Ground 1

47. The judge found that the appellant was a persistent offender  but  gave
    no reasons for his finding. Ground 1 contends that the judge's  finding
    that the appellant was a persistent offender who has shown a particular
    disregard for the  law  was  irrational,  given  that  the  appellant's
    convictions were 11 years apart and in light of para  26  of  Court  of
    Appeal's judgment in SC (Zimbabwe).

48. However, the submission that the appellant's convictions were 11  years
    apart ignores the fact that he had other convictions.  The  appellant's
    convictions are set out below. The Decision Letter mentions those  that
    are italicised below. The PNC mentions all the  offences  below  except
    for the convictions of 24 February 2005.

49. It is plain that the only significant gap was the 61/2 year gap between
    the 2010 conviction and the 2017 convictions. This is  much  less  than
    the gap of 11 years contended in the grounds. Whilst  it  may  be  that
    sentences for offences of simple possession of drugs  are  less  severe
    for sentencing purposes than sentences for offences of possession  with
    intent to supply, the fact is  that  every  single  one  of  the  above
    convictions is a  relevant  conviction  for  the  purpose  of  deciding
    whether the appellant  is  a  persistent  offender  with  a  particular
    disregard for the law.

50. In Chege ("is a persistent offender") [2016]  UKUT  00187  (IAC)  Upper
    Tribunal considered the meaning of "persistent offender". The  judicial
    head-note reads:

         "1.      The  question  whether  the  appellant  "is  a  persistent
             offender" is a question of mixed fact and law and falls to  be
             determined by the Tribunal as  at  the  date  of  the  hearing
             before it.

         2. The phrase "persistent offender" in s.117D(2)(c) of the 2002 Act
             must mean the same thing as "persistent offender" in paragraph
             398(c) of the Immigration Rules.

         3. A "persistent offender" is someone who  keeps  on  breaking  the
             law. That does not mean, however,  that  he  has  to  keep  on
             offending until the date of the relevant decision or that  the
             continuity of the offending cannot be  broken.  A  "persistent
             offender" is not a permanent status that  can  never  be  lost
             once it is acquired, but an individual can be  regarded  as  a
             "persistent offender" for the purpose of  the  Rules  and  the
             2002 Act even though he may not have offended for  some  time.
             The question whether he fits that description will  depend  on
             the overall picture and pattern  of  his  offending  over  his
             entire offending history up to that date. Each case will  turn
             on its own facts."

51. The decision in Chege was  approved  by  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  SC
    (Zimbabwe). Thus, the fact that there was a 61/2 year gap  between  the
    appellant's conviction in  2010  and  his  convictions  in  2017  is  a
    relevant fact but not the only relevant fact.

52. However, an important factor in the instant case is that the  appellant
    committed the offences of which he was convicted on  21  November  2016
    following his successful appeal in April 2008. The 2008 Panel noted, at
    para 36 of its decision, that:

         "... The appellant was involved in drug  dealing  with  a  view  to
         financial gain. He had used cannabis very regularly  and  has  been
         using cocaine since he was aged 17...."

53. The panel then proceeded to find that the appellant "has learnt a  good
    deal from his time in custody and has appreciated the major  impact  on
    his own and others' lives of his  wrongdoing"  and  that  "he  has  now
    learnt his lesson and will settle down on release from custody".

54. Furthermore, when  the  appellant  received  his  9-month  sentence  of
    imprisonment on 22 March 2017, the sentencing judge said as follows:

         "... you were convicted by the jury of  an  offence  of  possessing
         cannabis with intent to supply, an offence that dates back  to  the
         10'h February last year. On that occasion the police attended  your
         address where, at the time, you were with certainly at least one of
         your children together with a quantity of drugs. There was cannabis
         in your bedroom next to your bed, alongside a number of self-sealed
         bags; in the living room there were further  amounts  of  cannabis,
         also in a self-sealed bag, as well as cannabis on the  mantelpiece.
         The total quantity is said to be just over 30 grams, worth  on  the
         street [sic] around �300.  Other  items  were  also  found  in  the
         address consistent with drug supply; scales were recovered, a large
         quantity of the self-sealed bags of the  sort  that  were  used  to
         contain the cannabis that was recovered, and also a large  quantity
         of cash - �4,570 - which was found in a blue plastic bag on top  of
         the safe in the bedroom. And it is quite clear from  that  evidence
         that you've been involved  in  street  level  dealing,  although  I
         actually discount what's said  in  the  pre-sentence  report  about
         messages on your phone because, as I recall, there  was  absolutely
         no evidence of that.

         You're now 30 years of age and you have been before the courts many
         times before for drug offences. They are in  the  main  convictions
         for possessing  drugs  but  you  do  also  have  a  conviction  for
         possessing drugs with intent to supply  in  2007.  You  received  a
         custodial sentence in relation to that offence and, notwithstanding
         that, you continued to find yourself before  the  courts  for  drug
         offences again, albeit only for possession. "

         (my emphasis)

55. Whilst the appellant said in evidence before the 2008 Panel that he had
    been using cannabis since the age of 17 years, the Pre-sentence  Report
    dated 14 March 2017 (the "PSR") which was before the judge states  that
    the appellant had informed the author of the PSR that he had been using
    cannabis since the age of 11 years. Importantly, the author of the  PSR
    said that the appellant had stated that "his  cannabis  [use]  was  not
    problematic" and that he had not expressed any  motivation  to  address
    his drug use.

56. In relation to the risk of re-offending, the author of the  PSR  stated
    that the appellant scored 64% which equated to a medium risk of risk of
    re-offending. However, the dynamic factors in his case  (illicit  drugs
    use, negative peers, lack of employment/finance) led him to assess  the
    risk of re-offending as high.

57. I have concluded that, whilst the judge should have given  reasons  for
    his finding that the appellant was a  persistent  offender,  there  was
    ample evidence before him  for  him  to  reach  the  finding  that  the
    appellant was a persistent offender, given:

    i)     that the appellant has used cannabis very regularly and had been
         using cannabis (according to the evidence he gave the  2008  Panel)
         since the age of 17 years but, according to the information he gave
         the author of the PSR, since the age of 11 years;

    ii)    that there was no evidence before the judge that  the  appellant
         had ceased taking drugs;

    iii)   that the author of the PSR assessed him to pose a high  risk  of
         re-offending and that there was no evidence before the  judge  that
         the dynamic risk factors in his case had reduced;

    iv)    that the appellant had said to the author of the PSR  that  "his
         cannabis [use] was not problematic" and that he had  not  expressed
         any motivation to address his drug use;

    v)     that it is clear from the sentencing remarks dated 22 March 2017
         that cannabis was found in the appellant's  bedroom  next  to  this
         bed, along with a number of sealed  bags,  and  cannabis  was  also
         found on his mantelpiece;

    vi)    that the decision of the 2008 Panel plainly put  him  on  notice
         that, if he engaged in further criminal conduct, "he should  be  in
         doubt as to the very serious consequences or himself and his family
         life". Nonetheless, he  was  subsequently  convicted,  in  November
         2016, of offences of possession  with  intent  to  supply  Class  B
         drugs; and

    vii)   that, at the date of the hearing before the judge, there  was  a
         10-year court order in place prohibiting the appellant from  seeing
         his brother. This was a  protection  from  harassment  order.  Such
         orders are not made lightly.

58. I place particular reliance upon the fact that the  appellant  had  not
    expressed to the author of the PSR any motivation to address his  drugs
    use, that there was no evidence before the judge that the appellant had
    ceased taking drugs, that the appellant was  assessed  in  the  PSR  as
    posing a high risk of re-offending and there was no evidence before the
    judge that the dynamic risk factors in his case had reduced. These  are
    very  important  considerations  when  viewed  against  the  background
    history of criminal convictions.

59. I have concluded that, on the evidence that was before him,  the  judge
    could not have reached any finding other than that the appellant was  a
    persistent offender with a particular disregard for  the  law,  on  any
    legitimate view. His finding simply cannot be said to be irrational, on
    any legitimate view. His error was in failing to give any  reasons  for
    his finding. This is not sufficient for his finding to be set aside.

60. It has not been suggested on the appellant's behalf that the  error  in
    finding that the appellant was a persistent offender means that s.117A-
    D of the 2002 Act and para 398 of the Immigration Rules do  not  apply.
    Any such argument could have no purchase for the following reasons:

    (i)    the judge made  an  alternative  finding,  which  has  not  been
         challenged, that the appellant had been sentenced in the past to  a
         period of detention between 12 months and  4  years.  Plainly,  the
         judge was referring to the sentence of 30 months'  detention  in  a
         young offenders' institution imposed on 22 February 2007. Sentences
         of detention in a young offenders' institution  fall  to  be  taken
         into account  in  deciding  whether  an  individual  is  a  foreign
         criminal, pursuant to s.117D(4)(2) of the 2002 Act.

         Mr Ahbim accepted that the appellant had been sentenced in the past
         to a period of detention between 12 months and 2 years. In  Johnson
         [2016] UKUT 00282 (IAC), the Upper  Tribunal  held  (Turner  J  and
         Upper Tribunal Judge Jordan) that an earlier period of imprisonment
         of four years or more may be relied upon in order  to  invoke  para
         398(a) of the Immigration Rules even if the sentence  for  a  later
         offence results in a period of imprisonment of less than  4  years.
         The same reasoning must apply by analogy to invoke para  398(b)  of
         the Immigration Rules.

    (ii)   In the further alternative,  the  respondent  decided  that  the
         appellant's convictions for drug offences had caused serious  harm.
         Given that the sentencing judge said that the appellant had  had  a
         significant role in street dealing of Class B drugs, the  appellant
         fell within s.117D(2)(c)(ii) of the 2002 Act and para 398(c) of the
         Immigration Rules as an offender whose offending had caused serious
         harm, on any legitimate view.

61. To summarise, I have concluded that the judge did not materially err in
    law in finding that the appellant is a persistent  offender.  If  I  am
    wrong and he did err in law, the appellant's Article 8 claim still fell
    to be considered under s.117A-D and para 398 for  the  two  alternative
    reasons given in the preceding paragraph at (i) and (ii).

62. I therefore reject ground 1.

Ground 3.b

63. I will deal with ground 3.b next. This contends that the judge erred in
    failing to consider  whether  the  appellant's  children  were  British
    citizens by reason of the fact that  they  were  the  children  of  the
    appellant who had settled status.

64. Given that the Decision Letter disputed the appellant's claim that  his
    children were British citizens,  the  appellant  should  have  produced
    evidence that they were British citizens.

65. However, the Decision Letter  accepted  that  the  appellant  had  been
    granted ILR on 26 July 1994.

66. The grounds contend that this means that the appellant's children  were
    British citizens. However, this would depend upon whether a deportation
    order had been made against the appellant. This is because  the  making
    of a deportation order invalidates a person's ILR pursuant to s.5(1) of
    the Immigration Act 1971.  Even if an appeal is subsequently allowed by
    the Tribunal, this does not result in the ILR being reinstated  (George
    [2014] UKSC 28).

67. I am satisfied that a deportation order has not been signed at any time
    against the  appellant.  This  is  because  the  automatic  deportation
    provisions in s.32 of the UK Borders Act 2007 did not apply.

68. Given that a deportation order has not been made against the appellant,
    the appellant's ILR has not been invalidated.

69. On this basis alone, the judge should have found that  the  appellant's
    children were  all  British  citizens.  Accordingly,  contrary  to  his
    finding at para 63.b., C2 and C3 are British citizens. The judge  erred
    in finding that it had not been shown that they were British citizens.

70. However, I am satisfied  that  this  error  is  not  material  for  the
    following reasons:

    (i)     the  judge  went  on  to  consider  whether   the   appellant's
         deportation would be unduly harsh on the children;

    (ii)   for the reasons given at paras 72-86 below, the  judge  did  not
         materially err in law  in  his  consideration  of  the  appellant's
         family life claim based on his relationship with his children, i.e.
         Exception 2 in s.117C(5) of the 2002 Act and  para  399(a)  of  the
         Immigration Rules; and

    (iii)  the judge did not decide the appeal on the basis that  it  would
         not be unduly harsh for the children to leave the  United  Kingdom.
         If he had done so, the fact that the children were British citizens
         would have meant that it would have been necessary for him to  have
         taken into account the fact that the children will lose the benefit
         of growing up in the country of  their  birth  and  nationality  in
         order to reach his finding that it would not be  unduly  harsh  for
         the children to leave the United Kingdom. As he did not, this issue
         simply does not arise.

71. I therefore reject ground 3.b as it does not establish a material error
    of law.

Ground 2

72. I turn now to ground 2. This concerns the appellant's family life claim
    based on his relationship with  his  children.  It  therefore  concerns
    Exception 2 in s.117B(5) and para 398(a) of the Immigration Rules.

73. Mr Ahbim's reliance upon s.117B(6) of  the  2002  Act  in  relation  to
    ground 2 is misconceived, as s.117B states, in terms, that  it  applies
    "In the case of  a  person  who  is  not  liable  to  deportation"  (my
    emphasis).

74. As can be seen from paras 35-37 above, I pressed Mr  Ahbim  to  explain
    what  evidence  was  before  the  judge  to  show  the  impact  on  the
    appellant's children of his deportation.  He  acknowledged  that  there
    was no social worker's report. He could only refer me  to  the  judge's
    summary of the oral evidence of W3 and the appellant's sister. W3  said
    that C4 was very close to the appellant and that the  appellant  helped
    her a lot with C4. However, given that C4 saw his own biological father
    regularly and the judge's unchallenged finding that the  appellant  did
    not have a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with  C4,  W3's
    evidence simply takes the appellant's case nowhere. It simply cannot be
    said, from the judge's summary  of  the  evidence  of  the  appellant's
    sister,  that  the  sister  was  speaking  about  the  impact  on   the
    appellant's children when she said that the appellant's  removal  would
    cause upset to her and her family. In any event, feelings of upset  are
    not enough to show that it would be unduly harsh  for  a  child  to  be
    separated from his or her biological parent in a deportation case.

75. Given the judge's unchallenged findings that:

    (i)    the appellant did not have a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
         relationship with C1 as  C1  had  been  taken  into  care  and  the
         appellant had not seen C1 for the last 5 years; and

    (ii)   the appellant did not have a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
         relationship with C4 because C4's biological father still plays  an
         important role in his life and sees him regularly,

    ground 2 can only relate to C2 and C3.

76. However, there was no expert report before the judge, for  example,  in
    the form of a social worker's report, concerning the impact on  C2  and
    C3 of the appellant's deportation. None of the witnesses who gave  oral
    evidence gave any oral evidence about the impact on C2 and  C3  of  the
    appellant's deportation. The judge said that he had letters from C2 and
    C3 in which they said that they loved the appellant and  did  not  want
    him to be deported (para 22 of the judge's decision).

77. In his assessment at paras 63-65, the judge was considering whether the
    effect of the appellant's deportation on C2  and  C3  would  be  unduly
    harsh, i.e. whether Exception 2 in s.117C(5) of the 2002  Act  applies.
    Pursuant to para 399(a), he had to assess whether it  would  be  unduly
    harsh for C2 and C3 to live in Jamaica and whether it would  be  unduly
    harsh for C2 and C3  to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  without  the
    appellant. It is only if it is unduly harsh for C2 and C3  to  live  in
    Jamaica and for them to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  without  the
    appellant that the appellant can  succeed  under  para  399(a)  of  the
    Immigration Rules and therefore s.117C(5).

78. At para 65, the judge found that it would be in the best  interests  of
    C2 and C3 to remain with their mother. In  effect,  he  found  that  it
    would not be in their best interests to leave the  United  Kingdom  and
    live in Jamaica. Accordingly, if the appellant is deported, C2  and  C3
    would be separated from the appellant. The question  then  was  whether
    the impact on C2 and C3 of being separated from the appellant would  be
    unduly harsh. The judge found, at para 64, that it would not be  unduly
    harsh for C2 and C3  to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  without  the
    appellant.

79. I do not accept the contention in ground 2 that  the  judge  failed  to
    make adequate findings as to the  best  interests  of  the  appellant's
    children. He plainly found that it would be in their best interests for
    them to remain in the United Kingdom and,  by  that  finding,  that  it
    would not be in their best interests  for  them  to  leave  the  United
    Kingdom.

80. Whilst it may be said that the judge ought to have  considered  whether
    it would be in the best interests of C2 and C3  for  the  appellant  to
    continue to remain in the United Kingdom and continue to see them  once
    a week, he plainly contemplated this in the final sentence of para  65.
    Para 65 reads:

         "I also conclude that it is in the best interests of C1  to  remain
         as he has been for the last 5 years with no contact with A. I  also
         conclude that it is in the best interests of C2&3 and 4  to  remain
         with their respective mothers. However even if  I  am  wrong  about
         this and it is in the best interests of these various  children  to
         have A playing some sort of continuing  or  future  role  in  their
         lives, I conclude that their interests are outweighed by the public
         interest in deporting foreign criminals."

81. Mr Ahbim did not challenge the judge's reasoning in the final  sentence
    of para 65. However, I am aware that, pursuant to the  Supreme  Court's
    judgment in KO (Nigeria) and others v SSHD [2018] UKSC  53,  the  judge
    (through no fault of his own as he did not  have  the  benefit  of  the
    judgment in KO (Nigeria)) erred in  law  in  taking  into  account  the
    public interest in assessing whether it would be unduly  harsh  for  C2
    and C3 to remain in the United Kingdom without the appellant, which  is
    what he was plainly doing at para 65.

82. This issue could not have been raised in the  grounds  as  the  grounds
    were settled before the judgment in KO (Nigeria) was  delivered  on  24
    October 2018. However, Mr Ahbim did not raise it at the hearing either.



83. I have nevertheless considered whether the  judge's  error,  in  taking
    into account the public interest in the final sentence of para  65,  is
    material.

84. The meaning of the phrase "unduly harsh" was considered by the  Supreme
    Court in KO (Nigeria). At para 23 of its judgment), the  Supreme  Court
    said:

         "23.     ... the expression "unduly harsh" seems  clearly  intended
             to introduce a higher hurdle  than  that  of  "reasonableness"
             under section 117B(6), taking account of the  public  interest
             in the deportation of  foreign  criminals.  Further  the  word
             "unduly" implies an element of  comparison.  It  assumes  that
             there is a "due" level of "harshness", that is a  level  which
             may be acceptable or  justifiable  in  the  relevant  context.
             "Unduly" implies something going beyond that level.... One  is
             looking for a degree of  harshness  going  beyond  what  would
             necessarily  be  involved  for  any  child  faced   with   the
             deportation of a parent...."

             (my emphasis)

85. At para 27, the Supreme Court approved of  the  guidance  given  in  MK
    (Sierra Leone) v SSHD [2015] UKUT 223 (IAC) as to the  meaning  of  the
    phrase "unduly harsh". Para 27 reads:

         "27.     Authoritative guidance as to the meaning of "unduly harsh"
             in this context was given by the Upper Tribunal  (McCloskey  J
             President and  UT  Judge  Perkins)  in  MK  (Sierra  Leone)  v
             Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2015]  UKUT  223
             (IAC), [2015] INLR 563, para 46, a decision given on 15  April
             2015. They referred to the "evaluative assessment" required of
             the tribunal:

                  "By way of self-direction, we  are  mindful  that  'unduly
                  harsh' does not equate with  uncomfortable,  inconvenient,
                  undesirable  or  merely  difficult.  Rather,  it  poses  a
                  considerably more  elevated  threshold.  'Harsh'  in  this
                  context, denotes something severe, or  bleak.  It  is  the
                  antithesis of pleasant or  comfortable.  Furthermore,  the
                  addition of the adverb 'unduly' raises an already elevated
                  standard still higher."

             (my emphasis)

86. If the judge had not taken into account  the  public  interest  in  the
    final sentence in para 65, he could not  have  reached  any  conclusion
    other than that the evidence did not show that it would be unduly harsh
    for C2 and C3 to remain in the United Kingdom without the appellant, on
    any legitimate view. Whilst they will inevitably miss the appellant and
    be emotionally affected by his deportation and whilst they may well  be
    permanently separated from the appellant and thus be deprived of seeing
    their biological father, there was simply no evidence before the  judge
    to show that the emotional and psychological impact on C2 and C3  would
    be anything other than that which is ordinarily to be expected  by  the
    deportation of a parent, much less that it meets the threshold of being
    harsh, let alone the elevated threshold of undue hardship. This  is  so
    even if one leaves aside the fact that C2 and C3 do not live  with  the
    appellant, that they only see him once a week and that this arrangement
    had not been in place for long at the date of the  hearing  before  the
    judge.

87. I therefore reject ground 2.

Ground 4

88. I shall turn  next  to  ground  4,  since  this  also  relates  to  the
    appellant's family life claim, this time his family life claim with W3.



89. I draw the inference that Ground 4 concerns the appellant's family life
    claim with W3 because there can be no other  reason  for  the  passages
    from EB (Kosovo) and VW (Uganda) being quoted.

90. To the extent that para 24 of the grounds, which contends  that  it  is
    unreasonable to expect the appellant to return to Jamaica, concerns the
    appellant's private life claim, I will consider this in the context  of
    ground 3.a which plainly does concern his private life claim. Likewise,
    Mr Ahbim's submissions on ground 4  properly  concern  the  appellant's
    private life claim.

91. As I have said above, the crux of ground 4 is that it  is  unreasonable
    for family life to be enjoyed in Jamaica between the appellant and  W3.
    This ground is wholly misconceived. Whilst EB (Kosovo) and VW  (Uganda)
    are plainly still good law, the test in the case of a person subject to
    deportation action who relies upon his rights under Article  8  is  not
    whether it is reasonable to expect him and his partner to live  outside
    the United Kingdom but whether deportation would be unduly harsh on the
    partner (Exception 2 in s.117C(5)). By virtue of  para  399(b)  of  the
    Immigration Rules, this calls for an assessment of whether it would  be
    unduly harsh for the partner to  live  in  the  country  to  which  the
    deportee is to be deported and whether it would be unduly harsh for the
    partner to remain in the United Kingdom without the deportee.

92. As the Supreme Court said at para 23 of KO  (Nigeria),  the  expression
    "unduly harsh" is clearly intended to introduce a  higher  hurdle  than
    that of "reasonableness". It is therefore  misconceived  to  rely  upon
    cases which concern reasonableness of  a  partner  leaving  the  United
    Kingdom to enjoy family life in another country.

93. Further and in any event, the grounds did  not  challenge  the  judge's
    finding that the appellant had not established that W3 was his partner.



94. I therefore reject ground 4.

Ground 3.a

95. At the hearing, Mr Ahbim submitted that the judge's  finding  that  the
    appellant was not socially and  culturally  integrated  in  the  United
    Kingdom was irrational. When I pointed out that this was not raised  in
    the grounds, he submitted that this was the intention of ground 3. I am
    just about persuaded that he is right, i.e. that  ground  3  raises  an
    implicit challenge to the judge's finding that the  appellant  was  not
    socially and culturally integrated in the United Kingdom.

96. If one focuses only on the fact that the appellant  has  lived  in  the
    United Kingdom since the age of 4 years, then there may be  some  force
    in the challenge to the judge's finding  that  the  appellant  was  not
    socially and culturally integrated in the United Kingdom. However, that
    is not the only factor that falls to be considered. Even assuming  that
    the appellant has never left the United Kingdom, the judge relied  upon
    the fact that appellant is  a  persistent  offender  in  reaching  this
    finding.

97. Given that the appellant arrived at the age of 4 years, that (according
    to the information he gave the author of the PSR)  he  has  been  using
    drugs since the age of 11 years and given the history of  his  criminal
    convictions, I simply cannot say that  the  judge's  finding  that  the
    appellant was not socially and  culturally  integrated  in  the  United
    Kingdom was irrational.

98. In any event, even if the judge  erred  in  law  in  finding  that  the
    appellant is not socially  and  culturally  integrated  in  the  United
    Kingdom, this is not material unless he shows that the judge also erred
    in law in reaching his finding that there would not be very significant
    obstacles to his reintegration in Jamaica.

99. Ground 3.a relies, inter alia, upon the fact that the appellant is  now
    32 years old, he has never left the United Kingdom since; he has  never
    maintained any ties in Jamaica; and he has no social or  cultural  ties
    with Jamaica. However, whilst all this is correct, the fact is that the
    appellant gave evidence that his mother would go to Jamaica with him to
    help him establish himself (para 14 of the judge's  decision)  and  his
    mother gave evidence that  she  would  continue  to  provide  him  with
    financial  support  if  he  were  deported  (para  19  of  the  judge's
    decision). Given this evidence that was before the judge, the fact that
    the appellant speaks English which  (it  was  accepted  before  me)  is
    spoken in Jamaica and that he is a fit young man, it simply  cannot  be
    said that his finding that the appellant had not established that there
    would be very significant obstacles to his reintegration in Jamaica  is
    irrational.

100. I therefore reject ground 3.a.

101. At the end of his submissions, Mr  Ahbim  submitted  that  the  judge's
    finding that there were no very compelling circumstances over and above
    the Exceptions was irrational, given  the  factors  that  were  in  the
    appellant's favour, in particular, that he had arrived  in  the  United
    Kingdom at the age of 4 years.  He  submitted  that  the  compassionate
    circumstance was that the appellant had no ties to Jamaica which  is  a
    foreign country to  him.  The  judge  erred  when  he  found  that  the
    appellant's compassionate circumstances did  not  outweigh  the  public
    interest.

102. However, there was no challenge in the grounds to the  judge's  finding
    that there were no very compelling circumstances  over  and  above  the
    Exceptions.

103. Nevertheless, I have considered the submission.

104.  In NA (Pakistan) and others v SSHD [2016] EWCA Civ 662, the  Court  of
    Appeal held that a deportee could  rely,  by  way  of  very  compelling
    circumstances, on factual matters  falling  within  the  scope  of  the
    Exceptions as well as any factual matters which fall outside the  scope
    of  the  Exceptions  in  order  to  demonstrate  that  there  are  very
    compelling circumstances over and above the Exceptions.

105. However, it would be necessary for a  person  subject  the  deportation
    action to show that there are features which made his Article  8  claim
    "especially strong", in the case of an offender sentenced to  a  period
    of imprisonment of less than 4 years but at least 12 months (para 29 of
    the judgment) or (in my view, by  analogy  with  the  reasoning  in  NA
    (Pakistan)) in the case of a persistent offender;  and  "an  especially
    compelling kind ... going well beyond what would be necessary to make a
    bare case of the kind described in Exceptions 1 and 2" in the  case  of
    an offender sentenced to a period of imprisonment of at least  4  years
    (para 30 of the judgment).

106. At paras 33 and 34 of NA (Pakistan), the Court of Appeal said:

        "33.     Although there is no 'exceptionality' requirement, it
             inexorably follows from the statutory scheme that the cases in
             which circumstances are sufficiently compelling to outweigh
             the high public interest in deportation will be rare.  The
             commonplace incidents of family life, such as ageing parents
             in poor health or the natural love between parents and
             children, will not be sufficient.

        34.      The best interests of children certainly carry great
             weight, as identified by Lord Kerr in HH v Deputy Prosecutor
             of the Italian Republic [2012] UKSC 25; [2013] 1 AC 338 at
             [145].  Nevertheless, it is a consequence of criminal conduct
             that offenders may be separated from their children for many
             years, contrary to the best interests of those children.  The
             desirability of children being with both parents is a
             commonplace of family life.  That is not usually a
             sufficiently compelling circumstance to outweigh the high
             public interest in deporting foreign criminals.  As Rafferty
             LJ observed in Secretary of State for the Home Department v CT
             (Vietnam) [2016] EWCA Civ 488 at [38]:

                  "Neither the British nationality of the respondent's
                  children nor their likely separation from their father for
                  a long time are exceptional circumstances which outweigh
                  the public interest in his deportation.""

             (my emphasis)

107. There was simply nothing before the judge that showed that  there  were
    features about the appellant's family life  claim  in  connection  with
    Exception 2 that made his family life claim  especially  strong.  There
    was no evidence before the judge to show that the disruption  or  upset
    caused to his children would be any more than that which  a  chid  will
    naturally feel on being separated from his or her biological parent  if
    the parent is deported.

108. In relation to the appellant's private life  claim  under  Exception  1
    and para 398(b) of the Immigration Rules, I have said  that  the  judge
    did not err in law in finding that there would not be very  significant
    obstacles to his reintegration in Jamaica. The fact that he  has  lived
    in the United Kingdom for a lengthy period since the age of 4 years  is
    a relevant feature of his  private  life  claim  for  the  purposes  of
    deciding whether he has very compelling circumstances  over  and  above
    the Exceptions. This is because Maslov v Austria (1638/03) (2009)  INLR
    47 (to which I was not referred; indeed, I was not referred to  any  of
    the authorities I have mentioned save for EB (Kosovo) and VW  (Uganda),
    both of which were irrelevant)) fell to be considered.

109.  However,  given  the  judge's  finding,  that  the  appellant  was   a
    persistent offender with a  particular  disregard  for  the  law,  this
    feature of the appellant's Article 8 (i.e. his lengthy residence  since
    the age of 4 years) simply does not make the distance in  showing  that
    his Article 8 claim is especially strong, considering his private  life
    and family life claims individually and collectively. To put it in  the
    language used in Strasbourg jurisprudence,  the  very  serious  reasons
    required to justify deportation in the appellant's case, as someone who
    has had lengthy residence in the United Kingdom  since  the  age  of  4
    years with settled status for almost all of his residence, were founded
    on the judge's finding that he is a persistent offender. To put  it  in
    the language of  s.117C(6)  of  the  2002  Act  and  para  398  of  the
    Immigration Rules, the appellant had not shown, on the evidence  before
    the judge, that there are very compelling circumstances, over and above
    the exceptions, in his particular case.

110. The appellant's appeal is therefore dismissed.

    Decision

    The First-tier Tribunal's decision did not involve the  making  of  any
    error of law sufficient to require it to be set aside.

    Accordingly, the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  to  dismiss  the
    appellant's appeal against the respondent decision on  asylum  grounds,
    humanitarian protection grounds and human rights grounds stands.

Upper Tribunal Judge Gill

                                  APPENDIX

Sections 117A-D of the 2002 Act provide as follows:

    "117A Application of this Part

    (1)    This Part applies where a  court  or  tribunal  is  required  to
    determine whether a decision made under the Immigration Acts-

         (a)      breaches a person's  right  to  respect  for  private  and
         family life under Article 8, and

         (b)      as a result would be unlawful under section 6 of the Human
         Rights Act 1998.

    (2)    In considering  the  public  interest  question,  the  court  or
    tribunal must (in particular) have regard-

         (a)      in all cases, to  the  considerations  listed  in  section
         117B, and

         (b)      in cases concerning the deportation of foreign  criminals,
         to the considerations listed in section 117C.

    (3)    In subsection (2), "the  public  interest  question"  means  the
    question of whether an interference with a person's  right  to  respect
    for private and family life is justified under Article 8(2).




    117B Article 8: public interest considerations applicable in all cases

    (1)    The maintenance of effective immigration controls is in the
    public interest.

    (2)    It is in the public interest, and in particular in the interests
    of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that persons who seek
    to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are able to speak English,
    because persons who can speak English-

         (a)      are less of a burden on taxpayers, and

         (b)      are better able to integrate into society.

    (3)    It is in the public interest, and in particular in the interests
    of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that persons who seek
    to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are financially independent,
    because such persons-

         (a)      are not a burden on taxpayers, and

         (b)      are better able to integrate into society.

    (4)    Little weight should be given to-

         (a)      a private life, or

         (b)      a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,

         that is established by a person at a time when the person is in the
         United Kingdom unlawfully.

    (5)    Little weight should be given to a private life established by a
    person at a time when the person's immigration status is precarious.

    (6)    In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation, the
    public interest does not require the person's removal where-

         (a)      the person has a genuine and subsisting parental
         relationship with a qualifying child, and

         (b)      it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave
         the United Kingdom.




    117C Article 8 additional considerations in cases involving foreign
    criminals.

    (1)    The deportation of foreign criminals is in the public interest.

    (2)    The more serious the offence committed by a foreign criminal,
    the greater is the public interest in deportation of the criminal.

    (3)    In the case of a foreign criminal ("C") who has not been
    sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years or more, the public
    interest requires C's deportation unless Exception 1 or Exception 2
    applies.

    (4)    Exception 1 applies where-

         (a)      C has been lawfully resident in the United Kingdom for
         most of C's life,

         (b)      C is socially and culturally integrated in the United
         Kingdom, and

         (c)      there would be very significant obstacles to C's
         integration into the country to which C is proposed to be deported.

    (5)    Exception 2 applies where C has a genuine and subsisting
    relationship with a qualifying partner, or a genuine and subsisting
    parental relationship with a qualifying child, and the effect of C's
    deportation on the partner or child would be unduly harsh.

    (6)    In the case of a foreign criminal who has been sentenced to a
    period of imprisonment of at least four years, the public interest
    requires deportation unless there are very compelling circumstances,
    over and above those described in Exceptions 1 and 2.

    (7)    The considerations in subsections (1) to (6) are to be taken
    into account where a court or tribunal is considering a decision to
    deport a foreign criminal only to the extent that the reason for the
    decision was the offence or offences for which the criminal has been
    convicted.




    117D Interpretation of this Part

    (1)    ...

    (2)    In this Part, "foreign criminal" means a person-

         (a)      who is not a British citizen,

         (b)      who has  been  convicted  in  the  United  Kingdom  of  an
         offence, and

         (c)      who -

             (i) has been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of at least
             12 months,

             (ii)      has been convicted of an  offence  that  has  caused
             serious harm, or

             (iii)     is a persistent offender.




Paras 398, 399 and 399A of the Immigration Rules provide as follows:

    398.   Where a person claims that their deportation would be contrary
    to the UK's obligations under Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention,
    and

          (a)    the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to
          the public good and in the public interest because they have been
          convicted of an offence for which they have been sentenced to a
          period of imprisonment of at least four years;

          (b)    the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to
          the public good and in the public interest because they have been
          convicted of an offence for which they have been sentenced to a
          period of imprisonment of less than 4 years but at least 12
          months; or

          (c)    the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to
          the public good and in the public interest because, in the view of
          the Secretary of State, their offending has caused serious harm or
          they are a persistent offender who shows a particular disregard
          for the law,

    the Secretary of State in assessing that claim will consider whether
    paragraph 399 or 399A applies and, if it does not, the public interest
    in deportation will only be outweighed by other factors where there are
    very compelling circumstances, over and above those described in
    paragraphs 399 and 399A.




    399.   This paragraph applies where paragraph 398(b) or (c) applies if
    -

          (a)    the person has a genuine and subsisting parental
          relationship with a child under the age of 18 years who is in the
          UK and

              (i)      the child is a British citizen; or

              (ii)     the child has lived in the UK continuously for at
              least the 7 years immediately preceding the date of the
              immigration decision;

              and in either case

                   (a) it would be unduly harsh for the child to live in the
                   country to which the person is to be deported; and

                   (b) it would be unduly harsh for the child to remain in
                   the UK without the person who is to be deported;

          or

          (b)    the person has a genuine and subsisting relationship with a
          partner who is in the UK and is a British citizen or settled in
          the UK, and

              (i)      the relationship was formed at a time when the
              person (deportee) was in the UK lawfully and their
              immigration status was not precarious; and

              (ii)     it would be unduly harsh for that partner to live in
              the country to which the person is to be deported, because of
              compelling circumstances over and above those described in
              paragraph EX.2 of Appendix FM; and

              (iii)    it would be unduly harsh for that partner to remain
              in the UK without the person who is to be deported.




    399A.  This paragraph applies where paragraph 398(b) or (c) applies if
    -

          (a)    the person has been lawfully resident in the UK for most of
          his life; and

          (b)    he is socially and culturally integrated in the UK; and

          (c)    there would be very significant obstacles to his
          integration into the country to which it is proposed he is
          deported.
