Representation

For the Appellant:     Ms. J. Isherwood, Home Office Presenting Officer.
For the Respondents:   Mr. T. Uppal of Glen Solicitors.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. These are linked appeals against the decisions of First-tier  Tribunal
      Judge White  promulgated  on  16  April  2014,  allowing  Mrs  and  Mr
      Thalapiya's appeals against the Secretary of State's  decisions  dated
      19 December 2013 to refuse to vary leave to remain as, respectively, a
      Tier 4 (General) Student migrant and her dependant, and to remove them
      from the UK.


   2. Although before me the Secretary of State is the appellant and Mrs and
      Mr Thalapiya are the respondents, for the sake of consistency with the
      proceedings before the First-tier Tribunal I shall hereafter refer  to
      Mrs and Mr Thalapiya as the Appellants and the Secretary of  State  as
      the Respondent.


Background

   3. The Appellants are nationals of Nepal born on 21 February 1987 and  10
      July 1981. They are  wife  and  husband.  At  all  material  times  Mr
      Thapaliya (the Second Appellant)  has  been  treated  for  immigration
      purposes as the dependant of his wife and has been granted  leave  'in
      line' with her. The outcome of his appeal depends upon the outcome  of
      Mrs Thapaliya's (the First Appellant's) appeal.


   4. The First Appellant's germane immigration history is:

20 July 2009:    Entered UK with leave valid to 27 September 2010 as a  Tier
      4 (General) Student migrant.

25 Aug 2010:     Variation of leave  as  a  Tier  4  student,  valid  to  30
      September 2011.

24 Jan 2011:     Variation of leave as a Tier 4 student,  valid  to  31  May
      2014.

19 Sep 2013:     Decision to curtail leave  with  effect  from  18  November
      2013.

13 Nov 2013:     Application for variation of leave as a Tier 4  student  to
      pursue course running from 18 November 2013 to 16 January 2015.

19 Dec 2013:     Refusal of application.


   5. The First Appellant's application of 13 November 2013 was refused  for
      reasons set out in a  combined  Notice  of  Immigration  Decision  and
      'reasons for refusal' letter ('RFRL') dated  19  December  2013,  with
      particular reference to paragraph 245ZX(ha) of the Immigration  Rules.
      It was the Respondent's case,  in  effect,  to  quote  from  the  Rule
      applied, that "the grant  of  leave  to  remain  the  applicant  [was]
      seeking [would] lead to the applicant having spent more than  5  years
      in the UK as a Tier 4 (General) Migrant... studying courses at  degree
      level or above", where no relevant exception to the generality of  the
      Rule applied. The courses that the First Appellant  had  pursued  were
      identified in the Notice of Immigration  Decision/  RFRL  as  being  a
      level 6 advanced diploma  in  business  management,  a  level  7  BTEC
      Diploma in Management and Leadership, and a level 7 ACCA  course;  the
      current application was identified to be a level 7 MBA.


   6. The Second Appellant was refused 'in line' with his wife.


   7. The Appellants appealed to the IAC. In respect of paragraph  245ZX(ha)
      the Appellants argued in their Grounds of Appeal  that  the  five-year
      period was to be calculated by  reference  to  actual  time  spent  on
      courses rather than by reference to the periods of leave granted.  The
      Appellants did not raise any issue as to the level of courses that the
      Appellant had pursued.


   8. The First-tier Tribunal Judge, after a consideration without a hearing
      'on the papers', allowed the appeals under the Immigration  Rules  for
      reasons set out in his determination: see further below.


   9. The Respondent sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal which
      was granted on 21 May 2014 by First-tier Tribunal D'Imï¿½court.


Error of Law

  10. Notwithstanding the basis upon which the Appellants  put  their  case,
      and in particular that they did not dispute that the First Appellant's
      courses had been at 'degree level or above', the  First-tier  Tribunal
      Judge took a different approach. Further, in consequence of  taking  a
      different approach, in the event the Judge did  not  engage  with  the
      substance of the Appellants' Grounds of Appeal.


  11. At paragraph  13  the  Judge  determined,  without  reference  to  any
      materials and  without  any  specific  reasoning,  that  "the  diploma
      courses are clearly below degree level". The Judge also determined, in
      reliance upon Mirza (ACCA Fundamental  level  qualification  -  not  a
      recognised degree) [2013] UKUT 41 (IAC), that the level 7 ACCA  course
      was not at degree level or above, because it was not a degree course.


  12. Mr Uppal, fairly and properly, does not seek to  support  the  Judge's
      findings in respect of the diploma courses. The Judge was  plainly  in
      error. The definition section of the Immigration Rules,  paragraph  6,
      defines 'degree level study' as including "a  course  which  leads  to
      a... qualification at level 6 or above". The Judge manifestly did  not
      direct himself to this provision, and erred in consequence.


  13. Although Mr Uppal sought -  opportunistically  bearing  in  mind  this
      argument had not been advanced on behalf of the Appellants in  support
      of their appeals to the First-tier Tribunal - to rely upon the Judge's
      reasoning  consequent  upon  Mirza,  I  have  little   hesitation   in
      concluding that the Judge also erred in this regard.


  14. The key finding in Mirza  is  that  the  ACCA  does  not  have  degree
      awarding powers and therefore its qualifications are not UK recognised
      degrees. The context of such a finding was the particular requirements
      of  Table  10  of  Appendix  A  of  the  Rules  and  specifically  the
      stipulation  that  an  applicant  should  have  been  awarded  "a   UK
      recognised  Bachelor  degree,  Masters   degree   or   Ph.D   (not   a
      qualification of the equivalent level which is not a degree)". This is
      a narrower stipulation than the definition of 'degree level study'  at
      paragraph 6 of the Rules. The finding in Mirza is not a finding that a
      level 7 ACCA course does not constitute study at a level equivalent to
      degree level. In my judgement such a course is at a  level  equivalent
      to degree level or above: I also bear in mind in this context that the
      Appellants had not previously disputed this, and have only  sought  to
      dispute it at this stage in  reliance  upon  Judge  White's  erroneous
      reasoning.


  15. In the circumstances I find that the Judge misdirected himself in  law
      and erred in concluding that the level 7 ACCA course was not a  course
      at 'degree level or above'.


  16. The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  must  be  set  aside
      accordingly.


Re-making the Decision

  17. The decision in the appeal can readily  be  remade  before  the  Upper
      Tribunal without hearing  further  evidence.  The  analysis  above  in
      respect of course levels  necessarily  informs  the  remaking  of  the
      decision. In reliance upon that reasoning I find that at all  material
      times the First Appellant has pursued courses  in  the  UK  at  degree
      level or above.


  18. The issue in the appeal therefore becomes the one initially raised  by
      the Appellants in their Grounds of Appeal to the First-tier  Tribunal:
      whether the five-year period specified in paragraph  245ZX(ha)  refers
      to the overall period of leave or the overall period of study.


  19. I have little hesitation in concluding that the five-year period is in
      respect of the overall period of leave.


  20. In my judgement the words "studying courses at degree level or  above"
      in paragraph 245ZX(ha) qualify the basis or purpose of the Tier  4  or
      Student leave that has been granted to the applicant or  Student,  and
      are not to be read as qualifying the words "more  than  5  years".  It
      seems to me that the key words "as a" in the phrase "more than 5 years
      in the UK as a Tier 4 (General) Migrant" indicate  that  in  according
      the Rule its plain and natural meaning the 5 years is to be understood
      as denoting the period of leave in the capacity of a Tier 4 Migrant or
      Student. When a Tier 4 migrant with extant leave  is  not  studying  -
      whether that be because they are on  vacation,  or  because  they  are
      between courses - they are still  present  in  the  UK  as  a  Tier  4
      Migrant.


  21. Mr Uppal placed reliance upon the Respondent's published  guidance  in
      respect of Tier 4 (v13.0) (helpfully  reproduced  at  page  6  of  the
      Appellants' Bundle). In particular, he relied upon the  words  "To  be
      granted leave as a Tier 4 (General) migrant a  person  must:  ...  not
      spend more than five years studying at  degree  level  or  above".  He
      contended that this reinforced the Appellants' submission that it  was
      the period of studying rather  than  the  period  of  leave  that  was
      germane. I bear in mind that the Rules are the primary  source  for  a
      decision-maker, and for understanding their meaning: any  guidance  is
      subsidiary. I accept that there is an ambiguity in the  way  that  the
      guidance is set out. However, I do not accept  that  this  alters  the
      plain and natural meaning of the words in the Rule which is  aimed  at
      considering the overall periods of leave granted to a  person  wishing
      to pursue study at degree level or above. In my judgement it is  clear
      that the Rule denotes that five years leave  in  such  a  capacity  is
      intended as a maximum period.



  22. I acknowledge that the overall period is  to  be  calculated  in  this
      particular case taking into account  that  leave  was  curtailed  with
      effect from 18 November 2013 by Notice dated 19  September  2013.  The
      Appellants go  further,  and  argue  that  rather  than  the  date  of
      curtailment of leave, time should be calculated up to the date of  the
      revocation of the course provider's licence (5 August 2013) that  gave
      rise to the curtailment. I do not accept this submission: the  germane
      period is the period of leave, not the period of qualifying study.  In
      any event, the submission does not avail the Appellants as  the  grant
      of leave sought by the First Appellant to pursue a  course  ending  in
      January 2015 would have resulted in exceeding the five years specified
      in 245ZX(ha) even on the revised calculation contended.


  23. Further in this context I note the submission made by Mr Uppal to  the
      effect that the revocation of sponsor's licence  and  the  Appellant's
      associated necessary abandonment of that particular  course  of  study
      should mean that the period of time spent in the UK pursuing a  course
      that could not then be completed should not  count  towards  the  five
      years.  In  my  judgement  the  submission  is  without   merit;   the
      unfortunate circumstance of the disruption of study does not alter the
      fact that First Appellant was present in the UK as Tier 4 Migrant  who
      was studying a course at degree level or above.


  24. In all the circumstances I conclude that the Respondent's decision  in
      respect of the First Appellant was in accordance with the  Immigration
      Rules.  The  concomitant  decision  to  refuse  the  Second  Appellant
      variation of  leave  was  also  in  accordance  with  the  Rules.  The
      Appellants' appeals are dismissed under the Rules accordingly.


  25. Although reference is made to Article 8 in the Grounds  of  Appeal  to
      the First-tier Tribunal, and reference  is  also  made  in  the  First
      Appellant's witness statement of 27 February 2014 at  paragraph  5  by
      reference to her study, Mr Uppal confirmed to me  that  no  Article  8
      grounds were now pursued by the Appellants. This was sensible in light
      of Patel and others  [2013]  UKSC  72  (see  in  particular  per  Lord
      Carnwath at paragraph 57); see  also  Nasim  and  others  (Article  8)
      [2014] UKUT 00025 (IAC).


  26. There is no other challenge to the section 47 removal decisions.





Decisions

  27. The decisions of the First-tier Tribunal Judge were each  based  on  a
      material error of law and are set aside.


  28. I re-make the decisions in the appeals. The appeals are dismissed.
