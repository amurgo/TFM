Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr. S. Muquit, Counsel.
For the Respondent:    Mr. P. Duffy, Home Office Presenting Officer.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of India who appealed against a decision  of
    the respondent contained in a notice dated 7 March 2015 cancelling  his
    leave to remain in the  United  Kingdom  as  a  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)
    Migrant.  He appealed that decision and following a hearing  at  Hatton
    Cross Judge of the First-tier Tribunal M. P. W. Harris, in  a  decision
    promulgated on 26 August 2015, dismissed the appellant's appeal.

 2. The  appellant  sought  permission  to  appeal  which  was  granted  by
    Designated Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Garratt in a decision dated
    18 December 2015.  His reasons for so granting are:-

         "1.  The appellant applies in time to appeal against  the  decision
             of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal M P W Harris in  which  he
             dismissed the appeal against the decision of the respondent to
             cancel leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant.

         2.   The grounds  argue  that  the  judge  was  wrong  to  conclude
             (paragraph 20) that the appellant had not invested any of  the
             �50,000 he had amassed for his business venture in a period of
             almost two years from the time he was granted leave.  That  is
             because the  judge  wrongly  stated  (paragraph  6)  that  the
             appellant's leave was cancelled on 15th November 2015 when, in
             fact, it was curtailed when he  returned  from  India  on  7th
             March 2014.

         3.   The  grounds  are  arguable.   Bearing  in  mind  the  judge's
             conclusion about the appellant's failure to invest  funds  are
             material to his conclusions in paragraph 21 the arguable error
             would appear to be material.

         4.   Permission is granted."

 3. Thus the appeal came before me today.

 4. Mr. Muquit relied on the grounds seeking permission to  appeal  and  in
    particular that the judge was wrong to conclude at paragraph 20 of  his
    decision that the appellant had not invested any of the �50,000 he  had
    amassed for his business venture in a period of almost two  years  from
    the time he was granted his leave.  That being as a consequence of  the
    judge  wrongly  stating  at  paragraph  5  of  his  decision  that  the
    appellant's leave was cancelled on 15 November 2015 when, in  fact,  it
    was curtailed when he returned to the United Kingdom from  India  on  7
    March 2014.

 5. This argument was resisted by Mr. Duffy who relied on the  respondent's
    Rule 24 notice dated  29  December  2015.   He  argued,  amongst  other
    things,  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  had  directed  himself
    appropriately and that the inadvertent error in relation to the  expiry
    date of the appellant's leave does not amount to a material error.  The
    salient finding is that despite having the intention to invest  in  the
    claimed business the appellant has not  done  so  over  a  considerable
    period of time.  At the date of hearing the appellant had not  invested
    in the "alleged business" which was clearly close to  two  years  after
    the leave was granted and this was inconsistent with someone  investing
    in his own business.  This was  a finding open to the judge and  albeit
    that the judge granting permission to appeal found an arguable error of
    law the position is that such error cannot be said to be material.

 6. I do not accept Mr. Duffy's submissions.  The judge here  has  made  an
    error of fact which has led him into making a legal error in  assessing
    the appellant's intentions and investment.   It  is  a  material  error
    which has infected the decision as a  whole  and  as  Designated  Judge
    Garratt says in the third of his reasons  for  granting  permission  to
    appeal:-

         "... Bearing in mind the judge's conclusion about  the  appellant's
         failure  to  invest  funds  are  material  to  his  conclusions  in
         paragraph 21 the arguable error would appear to be material."

    That is the position that I find here.

 7. Consequently the appellant has been deprived of a fair  hearing  before
    the First-tier Tribunal.  The decision of the judge contains errors  of
    law and I set it aside in  its  entirety.   In  the  circumstances  the
    appropriate way forward is for the appeal to be  considered  afresh  by
    the First-tier Tribunal.

Decision

 8. The making of the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
    making of an error on a point of law.  The decision is set aside.   The
    appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be dealt with  afresh,
    pursuant  to  Section  12(2)(b)(i)  of  the   Tribunals,   Courts   and
    Enforcement Act 2007 and Practice Statement 7.2(b),  before  any  judge
    aside from Judge Harris.

 9. No anonymity direction is made.
