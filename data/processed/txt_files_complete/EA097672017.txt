For the Appellant:     Mr A Malik (counsel for Danbar Solicitors)
For the Respondent:    Mr S Kandola (Home Office Senior Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of Ernest Aidoo, a citizen  of  Ghana  born  22  6
       March 1989, against the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  of  15
       March 2018 dismissing his  appeal  against  the  refusal  of  an  EEA
       residence card, itself brought against the  Respondent's  refusal  of
       his EEA application on 23 November 2017.

    2. The Appellant had applied for a residence card on the  basis  of  his
       marriage to Maria Andreia  Mirrado  Monteiro,  a  Portuguese  citizen
       working in the UK.

    3. The Respondent identified the main considerations when assessing  the
       validity of a marriage: the need for the marriage to be recognised in
       the country in which it took place, having been properly executed  to
       satisfy the requirements of the law there, and there being nothing in
       the law of either party's country of domicile to restrict the freedom
       to marry. Any marriage certificate had to be issued  by  a  competent
       authority with legal power to create or confirm the facts to which it
       attested.

    4.  The  application  was  refused  because,  having   regard   to   the
       requirements of Ghanaian law which included a need to  show  capacity
       to marry under section 3(1)((c) of the Customary Marriage and Divorce
       (Registration) Law 1985, it was not  established  that  both  parties
       were entitled to participate in a  proxy  marriage:  no  evidence  of
       Ghanaian passports for the Appellant and Sponsor, or  their  parents,
       had been put forward. Accordingly, there was no  evidence  that  they
       had direct familial links to Ghana. There was no evidence proving the
       family  relationship  that  either  party  was  represented  at   the
       customary wedding by their father as claimed, nor that the  necessary
       dowry had been paid. Accordingly, it was  not  established  that  the
       marriage was a valid one and thus the Appellant's  claim  to  be  the
       family member of an EEA national was rejected.

    5. Before the First-tier Tribunal  the  evidence  included  a  marriage,
       certificate registered on 3 December 2013 records the marriage  on  6
       September 2014 of the Appellant and Sponsor. It is stamped and signed
       by a  Registrar  from  Accra.  An  affidavit  from  Fred  Aidoo,  the
       Appellant's father, recorded  that  he  represented  history  in  all
       matters concerning this customary marriage; Mario Monteiro  confirmed
       the same vis-�-vis her daughter.  Both joined  in  stating  that  the
       marriage was in accordance with the  customary  laws  and  usages  of
       Ghana, following the requisite dowry  being  duly  presented  to  the
       bride's family and that the customary marriage rites were  performed.
       They accordingly confirmed the contraction of a  customary  marriage,
       which had been duly registered.

    6. Samuel Boakye-Yiadom, the Second Deputy  Judicial  Secretary  of  the
       judicial service of Ghana  certified  that  the  signature  of  Kodwo
       Effirm Nunoo was appropriately stamped signed and sealed.  McArios  A
       Akanbono, Deputy Director, Legal and  Consular  Bureau,  Ministry  of
       Froreign Affairs and Regional Integration of Ghana, certified that Mr
       Boakye-Yiadom's signature was genuine.

    7. The First-tier Tribunal directed itself to Awuku  and  Cudjoe  noting
       that the central question was, given the law  of  England  and  Wales
       recognised proxy marriages so long as they were valid  in  the  place
       where they  were  celebrated,  whether  the  marriage  was  valid  in
       Ghanaian law.  The  documents  before  it  were  copies  rather  than
       originals. There was no birth certificate supplied  for  the  father.
       The "1994 authority" (i.e. McCabe v McCabe in the  Court  of  Appeal)
       relied upon by the Appellant (might no longer be authoritative, given
       the reference at �11 of NA Ghana to the participants in a valid proxy
       marriage having to be Ghanaian.  There  was  inadequate  evidence  to
       establish that the couple had cohabited, and furthermore  there  were
       unexplained entries in the bank account for  "CHB"  which  the  Judge
       presumed referred to the receipt of Child Benefit. This latter factor
       cast doubt on the genuineness of the relationship  as  there  was  no
       reference to a child being part of the family.

    8. There was no satisfactory  evidence  before  the  Tribunal  that  the
       parties were cohabiting such as to give rise to a viable  claim  that
       the Appellant was an extended family member by way of being a partner
       in a durable relationship.

    9. Grounds of appeal argued that the First-tier Tribunal  had  erred  in
       law in

        a) Rejecting a document ostensibly validly issued from a  competent
           body representing the Ghanaian government;

        b)  Giving  inadequate  reasons  for  rejecting  the  evidence   of
           cohabitation;

        c)  Wrongly  speculating  that  the  Appellant  had  supplied  bank
           statements that indicated he  received  Child  Benefit,  without
           notice of the point being given to him.

   10. Permission to appeal was granted by the First-tier Tribunal on 21 May
       2018, on the basis that the grounds of appeal were arguable. NA Ghana
       had not necessarily ruled that only Ghanaians  could  contract  proxy
       marriages; furthermore  it  was  arguable  that  relevant  supporting
       evidence was wrongly discounted by reference to it  being  "extremely
       limited" which appeared  inconsistent  with  the  civil  standard  of
       proof, and that the inference drawn  from  the  bank  statements  was
       unfair in the context of an appeal that was being determined  without
       a hearing.

   11. Mr Malik submitted that the chain of  documentation  from  Ghana  was
       ostensibly genuine and sufficient to establish the contents  therein:
       it was not open to the First-tier Tribunal to doubt the view  of  the
       competent authorities there as to the marriage's validity. There  was
       no clear reasoning as to why the burden of proof on the Respondent to
       establish that these documents were not genuine had been  discharged.
       The matter of Child Benefit had been raised without  notice,  and  on
       instructions, Mr Malik confirmed that  the  Appellant  had  explained
       that this referred to a bank  transfer  from  a  friend  rather  than
       recording the receipt of public funds as a parent. Finally, there was
       wrongful reference  to  the  EEA  Regulations  2006,  when  the  2016
       Regulations were the governing instrument.

   12. Mr Kandola replied that the decision was a lawful one  in  which  the
       Judge  had  appropriately  directed  themselves   to   all   relevant
       considerations.

   13. The representatives were agreed that in  the  event  I  identified  a
       material error of law, I  should  proceed  to  determine  the  appeal
       without a further hearing.

Findings and reasons

   14. I note that in fact the appeal  was  brought  under  The  Immigration
       (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016, not their predecessors  in
       2006. Thus there was ostensibly no right of appeal available  against
       the decision that the Appellant was not an  extended  family  member.
       However nothing turns on this feature of the case, as on my  findings
       below the Appellant is entitled to succeed on  his  primary  case  of
       "close family" (rather than "extended family") membership.

   15. The Upper Tribunal ruled in Cudjoe (Proxy marriages: burden of proof)
       Ghana [2016] UKUT 180 (IAC):

           "1.   It will be for an appellant  to  prove  that  their  proxy
           marriage was in accordance with the laws of the country in which
           it took place, and that both parties were  free  to  marry.  The
           burden of proof may be discharged by production  of  a  marriage
           certificate issued by a competent authority of  the  country  in
           which the marriage took place, and reliance upon  the  statutory
           presumption of  validity  consequent  to  such  production.  The
           reliability of marriage certificates and issuance by a competent
           authority are matters for an appellant to prove.

           2.    The means of proving that a proxy marriage was  contracted
           according to the laws of the country in which it took  place  is
           not limited to the production of a marriage certificate,  as  is
           recognised in Kareem (Proxy marriages - EU law) [2014]  UKUT  24
           (IAC).

           3.    In cases where a divorce has  taken  place  prior  to  the
           proxy marriage and there is an issue as to whether  the  parties
           were free to marry, it is for an  appellant  to  show  that  the
           dissolution of the previous marriage was in accordance with  the
           laws of the country in which it occurred."

   16. Section 3(1) of the PNDC (Provisional National Defence  Council)  Law
       112, specifically the Customary Marriage and  Divorce  (Registration)
       Law 1985, provides the legal basis  for  the  validity  of  customary
       marriages. Part 1 headed registration of  customary  marriage  states
       that:-

           "3.   (1)   The application for  registration  of  the  marriage
                shall be accompanied by a statutory declaration stating  the
                following: -

                    (a)      the names of the parties to the marriage;

                    (b)      the places of residence of the parties  at  the
                    time of the marriage;

                    (c)      that the conditions essential to  the  validity
                    of  the  marriage  in  accordance  with  the  applicable
                    customary law have been complied with.

                (2)    The  statutory  declaration  shall  be  supported  by
                parents of the spouses or persons standing in loco  parentis
                to the spouses expect where there are no such persons living
                at the time of application for registration."

   17. In NA Ghana [2009] UKAIT 00009 �11,  the  expert  evidence  of  Mercy
       Akman was cited as relevant to the criteria which must be  met  under
       Ghanaian customary law for a  customary  marriage  to  be  considered
       legal, thus:

           "7.   ...  It  is  a  type  of  marriage  contracted  under  the
           particular tradition and  customary  practices  of  a  group  of
           people. ... A valid  customary  marriage  can  only  be  validly
           contracted between two Ghanaian citizens and both  parties  must
           have capacity to marry. This  means  that  there  should  be  no
           violation of any rule of tribal relationship. These rules differ
           from tribe to tribe...

           8.    A particular characteristic of  customary  marriage  which
           distinguishes it from the system of marriage in Europe and other
           places is that it is not just a union of "this  man"  and  "this
           woman". It is the union of "the family of this woman"  and  "the
           family of this man". Marriage in the customary context therefore
           unites families and not merely the individuals.

           9.    It involves payment of a bride price by  the  bridegroom's
           family to the bride's family. If the appropriate bride price  is
           not paid, there is no valid marriage, even if  parties  live  as
           man and woman for many years. The acceptance of drink  from  the
           man's family is an indication  of  the  consent  of  the  wife's
           family  to  the  marriage....It  is  potentially  polygamous  in
           nature; a man may decide to marry as many women as his  strength
           and resources can accommodate.

           10.   There is not always a formal ceremony. Even if there  was,
           the couples do not have to be present at  this  ceremony  for  a
           valid marriage to take place, provided  representatives  of  the
           two families are present as witnesses to the meeting or event."

   18. NA Ghana at 15.5.2 sets out an extract then  extant  on  the  UK  BIA
       website which stated:

           "Since it is possible for  Ghanaians  living  outside  Ghana  to
           obtain the proper  certificates,  certificates  of  marriage  or
           divorce authenticated by the Ghanaian High Commission, should be
           requested in all cases where the marital state of  an  applicant
           is important. Statutory declarations made by a parent  or  other
           family elder  of  either  party  to  an  unregistered  customary
           marriage should only be accepted where they complete a chain  of
           otherwise  first  class  documentary  evidence  of  a  claim  to
           citizenship."

   19. McCabe v McCabe [1994] 1 FLR 410, a  decision  of  the  (English  and
       Welsh) Court  of  Appeal,  was  determined  on  the  basis  that  the
       customary proxy marriage of an Irish national to a Ghanaian  national
       was  valid,  despite  the  Irish  husband  not  being   of   Ghanaian
       nationality or origin.

   20. NA Ghana turned on the evidence that was necessary to demonstrate the
       dissolution of a customary  marriage.  When  recording  the  relevant
       evidence regarding the registration  and  dissolution  of  marriages,
       upon which the parties did not materially differ, the Tribunal  noted
       that "The onus of proving either a customary marriage or  dissolution
       rests on the party making the assertion";  and  concluded  that  oral
       evidence might suffice to establish  the  validity  of  a  marriage's
       dissolution, albeit that a party would be  expected  to  produce  the
       best evidence reasonably available to them. The evidence  from  Mercy
       Akman where she stated that only Ghanaian nationals could be party to
       these relationships was incidental to their conclusions. The Tribunal
       itemises the more significant aspects of the evidence before it  �24,
       observing that the material relied on by either side was to the  same
       effect -  but this aspect of her account  does  not  feature  amongst
       that evidence, and nor was it necessary for the Tribunal  to  subject
       the proposition to any analysis. In Awusu [2017] EWCA  Civ  178,  the
       appeal of Mr Awusu was allowed outright, notwithstanding that  he,  a
       Ghanaian national,  was  married  by  proxy  in  Ghana  to  a  German
       national.

   21. It seems to me that the First-tier Tribunal materially erred  in  law
       in its  very  brief  determination  of  the  issues  before  it.  The
       principal basis  for  its  decision  was  the  assumption  that  only
       Ghanaian nationals could be party to proxy  marriages.  However,  the
       absoluteness of that proposition is cast into doubt by both Awusu and
       McCabe. It is also inconsistent with the fact that in this particular
       case there is a chain of documents which on their face attest to  the
       compliance of the marriage with the  formalities  identified  in  the
       legislation. It seems to me that the First-tier  Tribunal  needed  to
       confront the precise material that was before it in the course of its
       conclusions.

   22. The phrase "The views of Judges change, as laws do, as  time  passes"
       �9 is an unduly scant rejection of reasoning of the Court  of  Appeal
       of England and Wales on a closely related issue. The reference to the
       documents being copies rather than originals is not followed through;
       however  it  would  appear  that  the  original  documents  had  been
       available to the Secretary of State, and no suggestion was made  that
       they should have been provided for the appeal hearing. So  that  line
       of reasoning adds nothing to the overall decision.

   23. I accordingly find that there is a  material  error  of  law  in  the
       decision below. The First-tier Tribunal failed  to  provide  adequate
       reasons for its conclusions, and failed to take account  of  relevant
       considerations before coming to those conclusions,  given  the  range
       and depth of material before it.

   24. In line with the parties' preferred resolution of the  appeal  I  now
       proceed to determine the matter finally.

   25. I do not consider that the Home Office  criticisms  of  the  evidence
       supplied by the Appellant and Sponsor have force. The Court of Appeal
       has twice issued judgments which  are  consistent  with  non-Ghanaian
       nationals,  and  indeed  individuals  with  no  identified   Ghanaian
       heritage, participating in valid proxy marriages. I acknowledge  that
       neither decision turned on this issue, but I consider the outcome  of
       those cases to be nevertheless telling. Before me  the  Secretary  of
       State has not identified any legislative authority that  would  stand
       in the way of proxy marriages of this nature.

   26. The burden of proof to establish the validity of his marriage lies on
       the Appellant, and mere inadequacies in the Home Office  critique  of
       his case are not sufficient to carry the day for  him.  Nevertheless,
       he has provided affirmative evidence in  support  of  his  case.  The
       statutory declaration before me states the parties to  the  marriage,
       their places of residence, and that the essential conditions for  the
       marriage's validity have been  satisfied.  Those  are  the  essential
       requirements for registration of a marriage to proceed under  Section
       3 of the legislation in question.

   27. There is a certified chain of evidence ostensibly issued by competent
       authorities in Ghana which confirms that the officials who  confirmed
       the registration of the marriage were acting  appropriately  in  line
       with their duties. The only reasonable inference  to  be  drawn  from
       that chain of evidence is that the marriage was  considered  apt  for
       valid  registration  by  the  original  Registrar.  The  Home  Office
       themselves acknowledge that a chain  of  satisfactory  documents  can
       evidence the validity of a marriage, as does the decision  of  Cudjoe
       cited above.

   28. It seems to me that  in  this  particular  case  the  evidence  chain
       suffices to discharge the  burden  of  proof  on  the  Appellant,  on
       balance of probabilities, to establish his marriage is a  valid  one.
       It can readily be appreciated that there will be cases where there is
       some overt feature of the evidence that casts doubt on some aspect of
       the procedures leading to the marriage, or upon  the  entitlement  of
       one party to marry. The latter possibility is acknowledged at (3)  of
       the headnote in Cudjoe. However, absent some express evidence casting
       doubt on a marriage's validity  it  seems  to  me  that  a  chain  of
       evidence such as that present  in  the  instant  appeal  suffices  to
       establish the Appellant's case.

   29. I accordingly find that the Appellant  is  the  family  member  of  a
       qualified person and that  he  is  entitled  to  the  residence  card
       originally sought. His appeal is allowed.

Decision:

       The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.

       The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is allowed.
