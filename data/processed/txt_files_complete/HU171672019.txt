Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms Williams, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr Anderson, Counsel


                          DECISION AND REASONS (V)


   1. The appellant has appealed against the respondent's decision  dated  7
      October 2019 to refuse his human rights claim on the ground  that  his
      deportation to Pakistan  would  breach  his  human  rights.   In  this
      decision I determine the  sole  narrow  issue  remaining  in  dispute:
      whether   the   appellant's   medical   conditions   and    particular
      circumstances are such that he faces treatment contrary to  Article  3
      of the ECHR, if removed to Pakistan.



Background

   2. The appellant, a citizen of Pakistan, was born there in 1965,  and  is
      55 years old.  His immigration history is very  lengthy  but  for  the
      purposes of this decision can be succinctly stated.  He arrived in the
      United Kingdom ('UK') lawfully in 1984, when he was 19 years old.   He
      married a British citizen and was granted indefinite leave  to  remain
      in 1986.  He has five British citizen children who are all resident in
      the UK.  The appellant was convicted of serious drugs  offences  which
      resulted in a five-year sentence in 1995,  a  three-year  sentence  in
      2001 and  a  seven-year  sentence  in  2008.   On  18  July  2011  the
      respondent made a decision to deport the appellant.   At  around  this
      time, his marriage broke down and he told me at the hearing  that  his
      divorce was finalised in 2011 or 2012.  It appears that the  appellant
      stopped taking illegal drugs whilst serving his last sentence, when he
      undertook coursework to assist with this.  Although he  has  not  been
      supported by his wife since his last release from prison, he  has  had
      the support of some of his children and his  sister,  Parveen  Akhtar,
      with whom he lives in Newport.

Procedural history

   3. The appellant's respective statutory appeals  against  a  decision  to
      deport him in 2011 and a further decision  to  refuse  to  revoke  the
      deportation decision in 2012 were dismissed.  He became appeals-rights
      exhausted on 29 November 2012.  In February  2013  the  appellant  was
      critically ill in hospital and remained in  a  coma  for  five  weeks.
      Subsequent efforts to remove him were unsuccessful and complicated for
      reasons  relating  to  his  medical  condition  and  treatment.   Many
      applications on health grounds were made on behalf  of  the  appellant
      over the intervening years.  The  respondent  ultimately  acknowledged
      the appellant's fresh claim submissions based upon medical evidence in
      the decision under appeal,  i.e.  the  respondent's  further  decision
      dated 7 October 2019, refusing his human rights claim and refusing  to
      revoke the deportation order.

   4. The appellant's appeal against that  decision  was  dismissed  on  all
      grounds by the First-tier Tribunal ('FTT')  in  a  decision  dated  14
      January 2020.  The FTT accepted that the appellant had spent  most  of
      his life in the UK but there were  no  significant  obstacles  to  his
      reintegration to Pakistan, noting at [43] that the evidence before  it
      and an earlier FTT (Judge Davidge) in 2012 was to the effect  that  he
      was in contact with relatives and his siblings in  his  home  area  of
      Pakistan, who could assist him with reintegration.  Although  the  FTT
      accepted  the  appellant's  relationship   with   his   children   and
      grandchildren in the UK, it found that this did not constitute  family
      life for the purposes of paragraph 399 of the  Immigration  Rules  and
      the relevant  circumstances  were  not  "very  compelling".   The  FTT
      dismissed the  appeal  on  both  Article  8  and  Article  3  grounds.
      Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal ('UT') was only granted  in
      relation to Article 3.

   5. In a decision dated 10 June 2020, UTJ Lindsley concluded that the  FTT
      erred in law  in  its  approach  to  Article  3  because  it  did  not
      adequately reason how the appellant would be able to  access  dialysis
      treatment in Pakistan, in particular the decision was silent as to how
      the appellant's siblings in Pakistan  would  be  able  to  practically
      assist him with his thrice weekly trips to the hospital for  dialysis,
      which were necessary to obviate sudden death.  UTJ Lindsley  preserved
      the unchallenged findings of the FTT with respect  to  Article  8,  as
      well as the appellant's ill-health and his need for regular treatment.
       UTJ Lindsley therefore narrowed the issue in dispute to Article 3 and
      in particular whether the  appellant  would  be  able  to  access  the
      treatment he requires to avoid sudden death.

   6. There have been two case management hearings before me.  In  addition,
      the final hearing on 27 January  2021  was  adjourned  to  enable  the
      appellant to obtain further medical evidence.    Over  the  course  of
      those hearings and again at the beginning of this hearing the  parties
      agreed the following matters.

        i) Although UTJ Lindsley's error of law decision was  made  on  the
           papers pursuant to rule 34  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
           Tribunal) Rules 2008, neither party objected to this course, and
           having considered JCWI v President of the UTIAC [2020] EWHC 3103
           (Admin), both parties accepted that the error  of  law  decision
           was not vitiated by any unfairness, such that the  matter  could
           fairly proceed before me as a resumed hearing.

       ii) UTJ Lindsley preserved the unchallenged factual findings of  the
           FTT and the parties agreed that the only issue  in  dispute  was
           contained at [17] of UTJ Lindsley's decision and relates  solely
           to Article 3 of the ECHR;  in  particular  the  availability  of
           dialysis treatment in Pakistan for this particular appellant and
           his ability to practically access  that  treatment  in  all  the
           circumstances, in the light of  the  guidance  contained  in  AM
           (Zimbabwe)  v  SSHD  [2020]  UKSC   17,   and   other   relevant
           authorities.

      iii) The parties accepted that AM (Zimbabwe)  is  authority  for  the
           proposition that it is for the appellant to adduce  prima  facie
           evidence  "capable  of  proving"  that,  if  not  challenged  or
           countered, such evidence would make out his case that Article  3
           of the ECHR would be breached by his removal.  In  other  words,
           the  appellant  has  the   initial   burden   of   demonstrating
           "substantial grounds" for believing, by  reference  to  evidence
           "capable of proving", that the treatment he requires  would  not
           be available or accessible to him in Pakistan.  The parties also
           agreed that it was only if the appellant displaced this  initial
           burden that the respondent  was  then  required  to  dispel  any
           "serious doubts" raised by the evidence, as  explained  by  Lord
           Wilson in AM (Zimbabwe) (supra) at [23] and [32]-[34].

       iv) The appellant has an extensive medical history and suffers  from
           end stage renal failure for which he is on  haemodialysis  three
           times a week.  This leads  to  tiredness  particularly  the  day
           after each dialysis session.  He has also been diagnosed with  a
           number of other medical conditions but the main  basis  for  his
           contention that he faces a breach  of  Article  3  upon  removal
           relates to the practical unavailability and / or inaccessibility
           of dialysis in his home area of Pakistan.

        v) The appellant is a vulnerable witness and  specific  adjustments
           have been agreed for  him  to  effectively  participate  in  the
           hearing.   The hearing could fairly take place  remotely  albeit
           adjustments  would  be  made  to  cater  for   the   appellant's
           particular physical needs and vulnerability.

       vi)  The  remaining  witnesses  would  give  evidence   from   their
           respective homes in  Newport  with  the  exception  of  Iftikhar
           Hussain who would give evidence from his home in Pakistan.

Evidence

Medical evidence

   7. When the matter first came before me for a final  hearing  in  January
      2021, the appellant relied upon medical evidence contained at pages 76
      to 93 of his bundle.  This included an email dated  27  November  2020
      from Dr Meran, the appellant's treating Consultant Nephrologist,  that
      his clinical condition remained "exactly the same" as  outlined  in  a
      short letter dated 5 December 2019 and a very short letter from Dr Ali
      Ionescu, a Consultant Respiratory Physician, dated 20 October 2020.

   8. After the adjournment of that hearing, two additional items of more up
      to date medical evidence were filed.  The first is a  letter  dated  3
      February 2021 from Dr Thwin, who describes  herself  as  a  'specialty
      doctor  in  renal  medicine'.   Dr  Thwin's  letter  appears  with   a
      letterhead that indicates that she is a specialty doctor working  with
      Dr Meran at the Newport Dialysis Unit of the  University  Hospital  of
      Wales.  This letter lists the appellant's primary  diagnosis  of  end-
      stage renal failure as well as a number of additional diagnoses before
      stating the following:

         "With regards to  his  kidney  disease,  he  has  end-stage  kidney
         failure and is dependent on ongoing three times a week, four  hours
         each session.  Haemodialysis treatment is to sustain his  life.  Mr
         Hussain has no urine output which is indicating he has no  residual
         renal function. Should he miss  or  delay  even  one  haemodialysis
         session then he risks sudden death.

         He is not a suitable candidate for renal transplantation due to his
         co-morbidities and he will require dialysis for  the  rest  of  his
         life.

         With regards to his  significant  co-morbities,  he  also  requires
         adjunctive treatment of  renal-related  anaemia  and  renal-related
         bone disease. His arterioveneous fistula  (AVF)  for  haemodialysis
         access  has  been  under  review  by  the  Vascular  Access   Team.
         Similarly, his ongoing significant recurrent chest infections  have
         been reviewed by Chest team.

         Furthermore, dialysis treatment itself has significant side effects
         resulting in the patient being extremely fatigued  with  a  general
         lack of well-being for the whole of  the  day  after  the  dialysis
         treatment.

         His general health, beyond his dialysis needs  is  also  poor  with
         chronic leg pain  due  to  his  renal  failure  and  smoking  which
         significantly impacts on his activities of daily living.   He  also
         has  a  poor  appetite,  poor  nutrition,  severe  depression   and
         financial difficulties. There is no chance of his health  condition
         improving but he will survive for a certain  period  by  continuing
         his current dialysis regimen treatments.

         In this situation, and with his multiple medical comorbities I feel
         that, he is not medically fit or suitable to  fly  to  Pakistan  or
         anywhere else."

   9. In a  letter  dated  15  February  2021,  Dr  Ionescu  summarised  the
      appellant's  various  conditions  as  follows:   bronchiectasis   with
      previous severe haemoptysis requiring admission to  intensive  care  -
      bronchial artery  embolization;  chronic  airway  disease  on  inhaled
      medication; moderately calcified  aortic  stenosis  and  regurgitation
      with moderation MR (under  cardiology);  chronic  renal  failure  (end
      stage) on regular dialysis, under the care of nephrology.  Dr  Ionescu
      noted that the various conditions are chronic and any  improvement  in
      the conditions is likely to be short lived.   She  recorded  that  the
      appellant was admitted to hospital with his lung condition at the  end
      of 2020 and seen in clinic in January 2021.  Dr Ionescu did not assess
      fitness to fly because "from a lung point of view" any such assessment
      would need to be very recent to the point of flying.

Evidence from the appellant and family members

  10. At the hearing the appellant confirmed  three  witness  statements  22
      August 2012, 9 December 2019 and 30  November  2020.   He  was  cross-
      examined  by  Mr  Anderson  at  some  length  but  was  provided  with
      appropriate breaks throughout and of course had  the  support  of  his
      solicitors, as he gave his evidence from their offices.

  11. The appellant has extensive close family members in Pakistan  and  the
      UK.  Many have prepared statements, affidavits and letters in  support
      of the appellant's appeal.  These are to be found in  the  appellant's
      bundle at pages 48 to 75.  I have carefully  considered  all  of  this
      evidence.  Four family members were tendered at the hearing and cross-
      examined:  Iftikhar Hussain (the appellant's brother-in-law  who  gave
      evidence from Pakistan); Samara Hussain, the appellant's daughter (who
      gave evidence from her home in Newport);  Mohammed  Mothansun  Hussain
      (who gave evidence from his home in  Newport),  and;  Perveen  Akhtar,
      with whom the appellant lives in Newport and who  gave  evidence  from
      her home.  Many of the family members have  the  same  surname  and  I
      therefore refer to them by their first names for the remainder of this
      decision.  In doing so I mean no disrespect, I simply wish to be clear
      about which family member I am referring to.

  12. Perveen relied upon a statement dated 2 December  2020  in  which  she
      confirmed that the appellant continued to reside with her, as  he  has
      done since 2012, and she cared for him "almost 24 hours per day".  The
      appellant has two  other  sisters.  Nasreen,  who  lives  in  Newport,
      prepared a letter of support in which she said that she  assisted  her
      brother with "regular sums of money" from her own wages as a  cleaner,
      and Shugufta  who  lives  in  Arifwala,  Pakistan,  with  her  husband
      Iftikifar.  He relied upon an affidavit  prepared  in  Pakistan,  when
      giving his evidence.  The appellant has  a  brother,  Amran  who  also
      lives in Arifwala.  He prepared an affidavit dated 14  December  2019,
      in which he described himself as a poor man and claimed that it  would
      be "impossible" for him to look after the appellant.

  13. As noted above, the appellant has five children in the UK, two of whom
      gave evidence at  the  hearing.   Mohammed  Mothansun  relied  upon  a
      statement dated 30 November 2020 in which he explained that  he  lived
      walking distance from the appellant and visited regularly in order  to
      help look after him.  The appellant's daughter Samara  relied  upon  a
      statement dated 30 November 2020.  She also lives nearby  in  Newport.
      In her oral evidence she  explained  that  she  has  been  financially
      supporting her father by giving him �30-40 per month.

  14. Although she did not give evidence there was a supporting letter dated
      19 June 2019 from the eldest child, now known as Aleema Khan.  In that
      letter she explained that she worked in the NHS and together with  her
      siblings she supported the appellant financially and physically.   The
      youngest son, Mohammed Adam lives with  his  mother,  the  appellant's
      former wife in Birmingham but is said to visit the appellant  once  or
      twice a month. There was  little  from  another  son,  Ansar  and  the
      appellant confirmed that they were not in touch.

Submissions

  15. Both Counsel acknowledged that the legal principles  were  agreed  and
      the case turned on the application of the facts and evidence to  those
      established principles. Mr Anderson relied upon his skeleton  argument
      and the country background information specifically obtained for  this
      appeal to support his submission  that  the  requisite  free  dialysis
      treatment  would  be  available  and  practically  accessible  to  the
      appellant in Arifwala, and the contrary assertion by the appellant and
      his family members in Pakistan  was  incredible  and  unreliable.   Ms
      Williams relied upon a skeleton argument prepared by previous  Counsel
      instructed on behalf of the appellant, Mr James.  She  submitted  that
      the evidence was so stark  that  the  proper  application  of  the  AM
      (Zimbabwe) test could  only  properly  lead  to  one  conclusion:  the
      appellant's removal to Pakistan would breach Article 3.

  16. At the end of the hearing both  representatives  confirmed  that  they
      were satisfied that the remote hearing was conducted fairly  and  they
      had no concerns whatsoever.  There were some technical challenges over
      the course of the day but these were negotiated and  resolved  to  the
      parties' and my satisfaction.  After hearing submissions I reserved my
      decision which I now provide with reasons.

Legal framework

  17. The applicable legal test was not in dispute and  the  relevant  legal
      framework can therefore be succinctly stated.  AM  (Zimbabwe)  (supra)
      marks an important departure from the previous position pursuant to  D
      v UK (1997) EHRR 423 and N v UK (2008) 47 EHRR 39.  The proper test is
      now whether return would lead "to a serious,  rapid  and  irreversible
      decline in his or her state of health resulting in  intense  suffering
      or to a significant reduction in life expectancy". That is to be  read
      together with the second category, beyond deathbed  cases,  identified
      in Paposhvili v Belgium [2017] Imm AR 867 namely those which "although
      not at imminent risk of dying, would face a real risk, on  account  of
      the absence of appropriate treatment in the receiving country  or  the
      lack of access to such treatment, of being exposed to a serious, rapid
      and irreversible decline in his or her state of  health  resulting  in
      intense suffering or to a significant reduction in life expectancy."

  18. At [23] of AM (Zimbabwe) the Supreme Court summarised  the  evidential
      approach, as adopted in Paposhvili, namely:

           "(a) in para 186 that it was for the applicants to adduce before
           the returning state  evidence  "capable  of  demonstrating  that
           there are substantial grounds for believing" that,  if  removed,
           they would be exposed to a real risk of subjection to  treatment
           contrary to article 3;

           (b) in para 187 that, where such evidence was adduced in support
           of an application under article 3,  it  was  for  the  returning
           state to "dispel any  doubts  raised  by  it";  to  subject  the
           alleged risk to  close  scrutiny;  and  to  address  reports  of
           reputable organisations about treatment in the receiving state;

           (c) in para 189 that the returning state had  to  "verify  on  a
           case-by-case basis" whether the care generally available in  the
           receiving state  was  in  practice  sufficient  to  prevent  the
           applicant's exposure to treatment contrary to article 3;

           (d) in para 190 that the returning state also  had  to  consider
           the accessibility of the treatment to the particular  applicant,
           including by reference to its cost if any, to the existence of a
           family network and to its geographical location; and

           (e) in para 191 that if, following examination of  the  relevant
           information, serious doubts continued to surround the impact  of
           removal,  the  returning  state  had  to  obtain  an  individual
           assurance from the receiving state  that  appropriate  treatment
           would be available and accessible to the applicant."

  19. The correct approach was further clarified at [32] as follows:

            "...The threshold, set out in para  23(a)  above,  is  for  the
            applicant to adduce evidence  "capable  of  demonstrating  that
            there are substantial grounds for  believing"  that  article  3
            would be violated. It may make formidable intellectual  demands
            on decision-makers who conclude  that  the  evidence  does  not
            establish "substantial grounds" to have to proceed to  consider
            whether nevertheless it is  "capable  of  demonstrating"  them.
            But, irrespective of the perhaps unnecessary complexity of  the
            test, let no one imagine  that  it  represents  an  undemanding
            threshold for an applicant to cross. For the requisite capacity
            of the evidence adduced by  the  applicant  is  to  demonstrate
            "substantial"  grounds  for  believing  that  it  is  a   "very
            exceptional" case because of a "real"  risk  of  subjection  to
            "inhuman" treatment. All three parties accept that Sales LJ was
            correct, in para 16, to describe the threshold as an obligation
            on an applicant to raise a  "prima  facie  case"  of  potential
            infringement of article 3. This means  a  case  which,  if  not
            challenged or countered, would establish the infringement:  see
            para 112 of a useful  analysis  in  the  Determination  of  the
            President of the Upper Tribunal and two of its senior judges in
            AXB v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2019]  UKUT
            00397 (IAC)."

  20. Savran v Denmark (57467/15) also makes it clear that  the  authorities
      must consider the extent to which  the  individual  in  question  will
      actually have  access  to  this  care  and  these  facilities  in  the
      receiving State.

Assessment of the evidence

Witnesses

  21. The appellant's evidence was unreliable in significant respects.  I do
      not accept his claim at  the  hearing  that  he  has  recently  become
      estranged from Amran, his brother in Pakistan and no  longer  had  any
      contact  with  him.   During  the  course  of  cross-examination,  the
      appellant repeatedly gave inconsistent  explanations  with  associated
      implausible timeframes.    At  first,  he  claimed  that  his  brother
      stopped talking to him when he found out  that  he  was  returning  to
      Pakistan.  When Mr Anderson pointed out  that  this  was  inconsistent
      with his written evidence, the appellant changed his  reasoning  to  a
      falling out over  the  brother's  daughter's  wedding.   When  it  was
      further pointed out that this  was  inconsistent  with  his  own  most
      recent statement, he simply repeated that his brother does  not  speak
      to him and transferred their parents' home to his sole name (when that
      was a matter  the appellant referred to at  [9]  of  his  most  recent
      statement at the same time as saying that they did speak  but  not  at
      length).  In addition, I note that in his statement dated  9  December
      2012 the appellant explained that he had not mentioned his brother and
      sister in Pakistan before because he had no contact with  them.   That
      assertion is difficult to reconcile with the appellant's  evidence  at
      the hearing that when they were  alive,  he  visited  his  parents  in
      Pakistan, who lived in the same house as his brother and  his  family.



  22. The appellant maintained  in  his  evidence  that  he  was  completely
      incapable of any physical activity whatsoever.  He  was  supported  in
      this assertion by some  of  his  family  members.   For  example,  his
      daughter Samara stated that he "cannot do anything for himself".  This
      is inconsistent with his own claim to have cleaned at the  mosque  and
      the reference to the appellant as a 'self-caring patient'  -  see  the
      letter dated 5 December 2019 from clinical nurse Merlin Tonio  at  the
      Newport Renal  Unit.   I  entirely  acknowledge  that  the  undisputed
      medical evidence describes wide-ranging and serious medical conditions
      which must have an inevitable impact on the  appellant's  day  to  day
      activities.  I am nonetheless satisfied that the appellant, his sister
      Perveen, his son Mohammad  Mothansun  and  his  daughter  Samara  have
      substantially embellished the nature and extent of the  care  that  is
      said to be necessary.  Perveen said in  her  statement  that  she  has
      cared for him "almost 24 hours a day".  That is  not  corroborated  by
      any independent evidence and is inconsistent with the appellant  being
      a 'self-caring patient'.

  23. In addition, the appellant was adamant  and  uncompromising  that  his
      family members in Pakistan would not support or  accommodate  him  and
      his family members in the UK would be unable to provide him  with  any
      financial support.  I do not accept these assertions, which were  full
      of contradictions and  inconsistent  with  the  preponderance  of  the
      evidence available to me.  I am satisfied that the appellant has  been
      and remains an integral part of a close and  loving  extended  family.
      They have continued  to  support  him  through  very  difficult  times
      (including after his  release  from  lengthy  imprisonment  for  drugs
      offences and during an extended period of  serious  ill-health).   The
      suggestion that this would  cease  upon  the  appellant's  removal  to
      Pakistan is not a credible reflection of the various and multi-layered
      longstanding  family  relationships  that  he  has   benefitted   from
      emotionally, practically and financially.

  24. In his affidavit Amran asserted that he was living  in  Arifwala  with
      his widowed disabled sister, who he had to take care of.  In  his  own
      statement  dated  9  December  2019,  the  appellant   addressed   his
      relationships with his  siblings  in  Pakistan  and  their  respective
      circumstances.  He stated that Shagufta  was  a  widow  and  earned  a
      living sewing clothes.  He repeated this assertion  in  his  statement
      dated 30 November 2020 in which he  claimed  that  he  would  have  no
      family support in Pakistan because his brother had to support his wife
      and children,  and  "our  widowed  sister  Shagufta".   During  cross-
      examination the appellant admitted that he did not have a  sister  who
      was a widow in Pakistan and that Shagufta was married to Iftikhar, and
      they lived together in a different house to his brother.   This  calls
      into question the circumstances of the appellant's brother and sister,
      as described in his most recent witness  statement.   I  am  satisfied
      that the  appellant  and  his  brother  have  sought  to  deliberately
      engineer a false impression of the true family situation in  Arifwala,
      to support a claim that the appellant would be unable  to  obtain  any
      support or accommodation from family members there.   I  am  satisfied
      that the appellant deliberately sought to paint an inaccurate  picture
      of his family's circumstances in Arifwala in  order  to  disguise  the
      fact that his brother and sister would both be able to offer him basic
      support and accommodation.

  25. In any event, having heard evidence from witnesses including Iftikhar,
      I am satisfied that Shagufta and Iftikhar would be able to support and
      accommodate the appellant at their home in  Arifwala.   They  have  no
      dependents.  When given evidence Iftikhar did not deny that they could
      not offer basic accommodation and support but said that  it  would  be
      "very difficult", without explaining this  clearly  or  credibly.    I
      invited Iftikhar to explain why he would be not be able to support the
      appellant with the assistance of remittances from  family  members  in
      the UK.  He was unable to answer that question and  simply  said  that
      the appellant should remain in  the  UK,  where  he  could  be  better
      supported.  Shagufta is a housewife with no known  medical  conditions
      that would prevent her  from  offering  the  appellant  practical  and
      emotional support. I am satisfied that with the support of her  sister
      Perveen, she would be able to provide similar  basic  support  to  the
      appellant i.e. accommodation, cleaning, assistance with medication and
      cooking (including any adapted diet).  When  she  gave  her  evidence,
      Perveen highlighted that it would be "better"  for  the  appellant  to
      remain in UK because she knew what he did and what he  ate.   She  was
      unable to explain why she could not explain these matters  to  Perveen
      or other family members in Pakistan beyond saying that  they  did  not
      have much contact.

  26. I am also satisfied that the appellant's close family members  in  the
      UK would  be  able  to  collectively  send  sufficient  funds  to  the
      appellant in Pakistan to enable him to pay for his  food,  board  with
      family members, travel expenses  as  well  as  any  necessary  medical
      expenses.  The blanket assertion by the  appellant  and  his  children
      that he will have no  money and no one to support him in  Arifwala  is
      entirely inconsistent with the evidence  of  comprehensive  (including
      financial) and long-standing support dating back to around 2011, after
      the appellant was  released  from  prison  and  diagnosed  with  renal
      failure.  As set out in his three statements, the  UK  family  members
      have supported the appellant since his release from prison  and  after
      he was served with a deportation order (which meant that  he  was  not
      permitted to claim public funds or work).

  27. I do not accept Samara's evidence that she would be unable to continue
      to afford the �30-40 monthly payment she said she has been  giving  to
      her father.  When pressed on this issue by Mr  Anderson,  she  claimed
      that she would not be able to  send  such  a  small  amount  by  money
      transfer.  She was entirely unable to explain why she could  not  send
      the equivalent monthly sum every three months.  I note that Samara has
      been regularly providing the appellant with money for some  time  (see
      page 66 of the  bundle).   She  and  her  husband  continue  to  work.
      Although they have their own commitments including a mortgage and four
      children (with one on the way), they have demonstrated an ability  and
      willingness to financially support the appellant in the past and  this
      can continue.

  28. According to their own  letters  in  support  of  the  appellant,  the
      appellant's two sisters in the UK, Perveen (page 73) and Nasreen (page
      60), his son Mohammed Mothansun  (page  71)  and  his  other  daughter
      Aleema Khan  (page  68)  have  also  been  contributing  regularly  to
      financially supporting the appellant.  Indeed, the appellant  made  it
      clear in his statements that he has  had  no  financial  incentive  to
      return to drugs because he is amply financially supported in the UK by
      his relatives.  I note that Perveen is in receipt of Universal  Credit
      and not working but she has been providing the appellant with his food
      and lodging since his release from prison (see [19] of the appellant's
      statement dated 9 December 2019 and [3]  of  her  statement  dated   2
      December 2020).  She would therefore have access to the funds  usually
      set aside for the appellant's food to send to Pakistan. I bear in mind
      Mohammed Mothansun's evidence that he  has  been  furloughed  and  has
      reduced the amount that he can provide (from �20-30 to �5-10), but  he
      agreed that  he  would  still  be  able  to  provide  something.   The
      appellant also agreed that his son Mohammed Adam worked in a  takeaway
      from time to time.  It is difficult to see why he could not contribute
      a small monthly amount.  Adopting a conservative approach, the  family
      members in the UK should be able to collectively remit  at  least  �80
      per month to the appellant: Samara �35; Aleena �5; Mohammed  Mothansun
      �10; Mohammed Adam �5; Perveen �15; Nasreen �10.  It is well known and
      was accepted by Mohammed Hussain during the  course  of  his  evidence
      that the cost of living is much lower in  Pakistan  than  the  UK.   A
      modest income of �80 per month, would go much further in Pakistan than
      it would do in the UK.

Medical evidence

  29. The respondent accepted that the appellant's end stage  renal  failure
      is such that he needs thrice weekly dialysis and that without this  he
      will die. The appellant's treating physicians  have  also  highlighted
      his other health difficulties as set out in the more recent  evidence.
      The respondent submitted that it is only the evidence  in  respect  of
      the need for dialysis that comes close to engaging Article 3, and that
      if dialysis is available and accessible, none  of  the  other  matters
      relied upon could  plausibly  suffice.   Although  the  appellant  has
      focused attention  upon  the  unavailability  and  inaccessibility  of
      dialysis in the main, in my judgment it is  important  to  assess  the
      appellant's medical conditions holistically, when considering both the
      availability of treatment to obviate a breach of Article  3  and  this
      appellant's ability to access that treatment, and  I  confirm  that  I
      have done so.

  30. The medical evidence that the appellant is unable  to  miss  even  one
      dialysis treatment without risking sudden death is,  as  submitted  on
      his behalf, stark, serious and specific.  By contrast the remainder of
      the medical evidence is less stark and lacking in  detail.   I  accept
      that the appellant's general health, beyond his need for dialysis,  is
      poor.  This includes comorbidities linked to  his  kidney  disease  as
      well as other matters including ongoing significant chest disease  and
      depression.  However, aside from the appellant's own assertions as  to
      his need for  regular  reviews,  the  available  medical  evidence  is
      limited and only set out in the form of short updating letters.  These
      have understandably focused upon the need for thrice weekly  dialysis,
      without which there is a risk of sudden  death.   However,  there  has
      been no meaningful attempt by any medical  expert  to  comprehensively
      address with a degree of precision the nature and extent of the  range
      of treatment and support received in the UK or the extent to which the
      facilities, treatment and support available to him in  Pakistan  would
      be insufficient to avoid a serious rapid and irreversible  decline  in
      his state of health.  In addition, on behalf of the  appellant,  there
      has been no meaningful attempt to engage  with  the  matters  set  out
      below:

        a) the necessity or extent of oversight or reviews  required  by  a
           nephrologist, in addition to the thrice weekly dialysis;

        b) the nature and frequency of adjunctive  treatment  required  for
           renal-related anaemia and bone disease  (Dr  Meran  referred  to
           this treatment being in  the  form  of  medication;  Dr  Thwin's
           letter was silent on the nature of the treatment; in  any  event
           Ms Williams did not suggest that  the  relevant  medication  was
           unavailable in Pakistan);

        c) the frequency of reviews by the chest team (Dr Thwin noted  that
           "his ongoing significant chest infections have been reviewed  by
           the Chest team" but  whilst  Dr  Ionescu  made  reference  to  a
           general review at the beginning of January 2021,  there  was  no
           clear reference to ongoing  regular  reviews;  in  addition,  Dr
           Thwin highlighted that arrangements would need to  be  made  for
           the appellant to receive regular dialysis, were he to travel  to
           Pakistan but does not clearly set out what his  chest  condition
           would require in Pakistan);

        d) the extent to which the additional diagnoses  require  oversight
           or reviews (by way of example, Dr Meran noted in  December  2019
           that the appellant required  ongoing  input  from  the  vascular
           access team but there is no clear reference to  ongoing  reviews
           in Dr Thwin's more recent letter which states that he "has  been
           under review by the vascular access team" and in any event there
           has been no attempt to suggest that any necessary reviews  could
           not take place in Pakistan);

        e) the extent to which the appellant requires a carer when fatigued
           the  day  after  dialysis  treatments  (although   Perveen   has
           described  herself  as  the  appellant's  carer   and   Mohammad
           Mothansun said that they  did  "everything"  for  him,  this  is
           unsupported by independent evidence);

        f) the appellant's current life expectancy or any  change  to  this
           once in Pakistan aside from the consequence of not having access
           to the necessary dialysis treatment (Dr  Thwin  only  refers  to
           surviving for "a certain period" and Dr Ionescu refers to a poor
           prognosis);

        g) why he is transferred to hospital by ambulance and whether  that
           can be replaced by a taxi service (there is no medical  evidence
           to support any  claim  that  only  an  equipped  ambulance  will
           suffice for transport services particularly in the light of  the
           appellant's own evidence that he has been able to  help  out  at
           the  Mosque  by  laying  out  food,  preparing  accessories  and
           cleaning the toilets; in addition the appellant's evidence  that
           he cannot travel alone sits uneasily with  him  being  a  'self-
           caring' patient able to help out in the Mosque in the manner  he
           has claimed);

        h)  although  it  is  said  the  appellant  suffers  from   'severe
           depression' there is no psychological / psychiatric evidence  to
           support this diagnosis (I note that  the  appellant's  claim  to
           have been suffering from  depression  since  2012  and  to  have
           suicidal ideations in his statement dated 9  December  2019  has
           not been supported by any independent evidence.  In addition  it
           was no part of the case put forward on behalf of  the  appellant
           that he is at risk of suicide if returned to Pakistan);

        i) the costings of the medication (including suitable  alternatives
           to the  list  of  medication  in  the  appellant's  bundle)  and
           treatment (other than dialysis) required in Pakistan to  support
           the appellant's blanket assertion that this would be  completely
           unaffordable, even  with  the  financial  assistance  of  family
           members.

  31. Notwithstanding the above  omissions,  I  accept  that  the  appellant
      suffers  from  very  poor  ill-health  as  described  in  the  medical
      evidence.  I also accept that in  addition  to  dialysis  he  requires
      medication for his other conditions and other treatment from  time  to
      time.  In my judgment that in itself is insufficient to raise a 'prima
      facie case' of potential infringement of Article  3.   A  prima  facie
      case means a  case  which,  if  not  challenged  or  countered,  would
      establish the infringement.  In order to  establish  infringement  the
      appellant needs to demonstrate that the treatment he requires is  both
      unavailable and inaccessible to him in Pakistan.  I now turn to  these
      matters.

Availability

  32. I am satisfied that when the country background evidence is considered
      as a whole, there is sufficiently cogent evidence that  thrice  weekly
      dialysis would  be  available  without  charge  to  the  appellant  in
      Arifwala.

  33. Ms Williams submitted that the CPIN report is the starting  point  for
      my enquiry.  At [4.19.4] this refers to a MedCOI  response,  dated  25
      July 2019, which in turn quotes from a 2016  news  article  containing
      the following:

         "Depending on public or private sector, each session dialysis would
         cost between PKR 3,000 and 5,000. The article further  states  that
         there is a demand and supply gap regarding  dialysis  treatment  in
         public hospitals. An endocrinologist at the Pakistan  Institute  of
         Medical Sciences in Islamabad has said that 'Pakistan needs half  a
         million machines to meet the need but sadly, there are only  19,000
         machines in the country.' The machines become overused  and  abused
         which affects their efficiency. In addition there are less than 200
         trained and qualified nephrologists for a population of  more  than
         180 million in the country."

  34. The MedCOI response goes  on  to  state  that  "according  to  a  2016
      research report, only 10% of patients  in  Pakistan  needing  dialysis
      receive this treatment due to the enormous cost  of  the  therapy  and
      that patients commonly reduce the dialysis frequency  because  of  the
      lack of financial resources".  This is of course  not  an  option  for
      this appellant because the undisputed medical evidence  suggests  that
      merely missing one dialysis session renders  him  at  risk  of  sudden
      death.  However, the MedCOI  response  goes  on  to  state  that  free
      dialysis is available to those unable to pay for it in  certain  parts
      of Pakistan,  with  examples  of  hospitals  provided  in  Lahore  and
      Karachi.  The COIS also notes the  general  inadequate  healthcare  in
      Pakistan and that this has been exacerbated by the pandemic.

  35. The COIS report clearly paints a gloomy picture of the availability of
      dialysis for much of the population in  Pakistan  albeit  acknowledges
      that in certain parts free dialysis is available.   The  latter  point
      is supported by evidence from the Noor  Foundation  that  dialysis  is
      provided for free at  20  locations  within  Pakistan,  including  the
      hospital in  Arifwala.   In  response  to  the  respondent's  specific
      requests for information  regarding  dialysis  provision  in  or  near
      Arifwala, the relevant Office of the Medical Superintendent  confirmed
      the following in March 2021, in relation to Pakpattan (about 22  miles
      from Arifwala):

             "6 dialysis machines in the main building and another  set  up
            of Dialysis Centre by the name of Asim Wahid Cardiac & Dialysis
            Centre within DHQ Hospital Pakpattan premises which operates 10
            Dialysis Machines. Both of these facilities have waiting listed
            of around 20 patients at any given time but  the  patients  are
            provided regular dialysis facility according  to  the  required
            standards."

      And in relation to Arifwala:

              "10 Dialysis Machines in the main building which are  working
             in both  shift  (Morning,  Evening),  20  patients  are  being
             facilitated per day and 40 patients are in  waiting  list  for
             dialysis".

  36. The reference to waiting lists in the above extracts were clarified in
      a letter from the British High Commission in Islamabad dated 29  March
      2021, as follows:

              "The patients described as on a waiting list are  the  number
             of patients who are currently receiving dialysis treatment  at
             the facilities.  They are outpatients  who  regularly  receive
             treatment on a specified date provided to them, at their  last
             appointment.  Occasionally there are more patients listed  for
             treatment on the same date, which  results  in  some  patients
             waiting for a couple of hours to receive the treatment.

             The information provided  is  not  indicative  of  a  list  of
             persons who are awaiting dialysis die to a lack  of  available
             spaces for treatment."

  37. In addition, the High Commission sought information as  to  the  rates
      for dialysis at  a  nearby  private  hospital  to  Arifwala  with  the
      following result: The Ahmed Health Complex in Pakpattan is  a  private
      hospital and has 20 units of dialysis that are running  double  shifts
      to accommodate as many patients as possible.  They charge  Rupees  400
      (� 2) per session of dialysis, a subsidised rate funded by  charities.
      There is a waiting list but they prioritise patients  from  the  local
      areas.

  38.  Ms  Williams  urged  me  to  approach  the  information  as  to   the
      availability of dialysis in or near  to  Arifwala  with  a  degree  of
      caution, given the general inadequacies in the healthcare provision in
      Pakistan.  I confirm that I have done so.  However it is important  to
      note that the CPIN acknowledges that free  dialysis  is  available  in
      some parts of Pakistan.  In order to  begin  to  establish  his  prima
      facie case  the  appellant  needed  to  demonstrate  inter  alia  that
      contrary to the information I have set  out  above,  dialysis  is  not
      available without charge in Arifwala.   The appellant has not  adduced
      any credible evidence from a reliable source in this regard. He relied
      upon evidence from his brother-in-law and brother but  their  evidence
      was unreliable.  The appellant claims that he  asked  his  brother  to
      check the hospital and how it operates, and that the general  view  is
      that dialysis is only available as long as the government provides the
      machines, and that there is no guarantee  he  would  be  accepted  for
      treatment.  I do not accept this evidence.  It is  based  upon  rumour
      and hearsay.  The statement of the appellant's brother to  the  effect
      that dialysis is not even available is plainly wrong.   In  any  event
      the brother did not attend the hearing in order to  be  cross-examined
      and his written evidence is unreliable for the reasons I have  already
      provided.  Iftikhar gave  evidence  that  the  dialysis  ward  of  the
      Arifwala hospital was locked but was unable to credibly explain how he
      was able to discern this.  I am satisfied  that  the  evidence  relied
      upon by the appellant  which  is  said  to  undermine  the  clear  and
      particularised  evidence  regarding  free  dialysis  availability   in
      Arifwala is vague and contrary to official information.

  39. The specific evidence  relied  upon  by  the  respondent  clearly  and
      cogently demonstrates that free dialysis would  be  available  to  the
      appellant at a  hospital  in  Arifwala  and  alternatively  nearby  in
      Pakpattan.   Should there be difficulties  from  time  to  time,  this
      could be supplemented by the private hospital at a modest cost.   This
      evidence is credible, sourced and specific.  When  the  COIS  is  read
      carefully  it  is  not  inconsistent  with  this,  because  the   COIS
      acknowledges that there is free dialysis in certain parts of Pakistan.



  40. I bear in mind that dialysis is unlikely to be the only treatment  the
      appellant requires.  He will also need medication  and  treatment  for
      his various conditions.  In this respect I note the letters  from  the
      appellant's treating physicians and his list of medication (pages  82-
      89 of the bundle).  These may be more difficult to access in  Pakistan
      but it was not disputed that such treatment would be available to  the
      appellant in Arifwala.

Accessibility

  41. I must also consider the extent to which the appellant  will  actually
      have access to the available treatment he requires.  I  must  consider
      all the relevant circumstances, including  inter  alia,  the  cost  of
      medication and  treatment,  the  existence  of  a  social  and  family
      network, and the distance to be travelled in order to have  access  to
      the required care.

  42. The appellant will be able to access free dialysis  in  Arifwala.   If
      there are sporadic difficulties with  free  access  in  Arifwala,  the
      appellant has the alternative of travelling to Pakpattan or  accessing
      the private hospital in Arifwala.  There has been no  serious  attempt
      to demonstrate that the  other  medication  he  requires  or  suitable
      alternatives  are  particularly  expensive.   It  is  noteworthy  that
      although the appellant has chronic and longstanding  conditions  there
      was little evidence that he required inpatient  treatment  apart  from
      relatively recently in  December  2020,  albeit  no  real  detail  was
      provided about this.

  43. As to the question whether the appellant will have  access  to  family
      support,  the  FTT's   preserved   findings   note   that   he   will.
      Notwithstanding this, I have considered the issue for myself given the
      more up to date evidence available to me, including further statements
      and oral evidence.  I am satisfied, for the  reasons  I  have  already
      provided above, that the appellant is likely to  have  the  day-to-day
      practical support of his family members in Pakistan, who  can  provide
      him with board and lodging in Arifwala.  He is also likely to have the
      financial support  of  his  family  members  living  in  the  UK,  and
      collectively they will be able to afford to regularly provide him with
      not insignificant funds, in the context of Pakistan.

  44. Iftikhar and Shugufta live about 1km from the Arifwala  hospital.  The
      appellant's brother also lives nearby in Arifwala.  I  do  not  accept
      his evidence or the evidence of the appellant and the remainder of the
      family members that the appellant  would  receive  no  help  from  his
      family members in Pakistan, who would be unable  to  accommodate  him.
      Iftikhar entirely avoiding my attempt to clarify why it  would  be  so
      difficult to accommodate and support the appellant with the assistance
      of remittances from the UK.

  45. The need for transportation would be minimal.  Although the  appellant
      suffers from various comorbidities there is no medical or other reason
      why he must travel by ambulance and cannot use taxi services, paid for
      by family in the UK.  I accept the evidence that the appellant suffers
      from exhaustion the day after each dialysis treatment but there is  no
      credible reason why the support provided  by  his  sister  in  the  UK
      cannot be replicated by family members working together with financial
      support from the UK.

  46. The appellant's prognosis is uncertain.  When the medical evidence  is
      read holistically, I am satisfied that there is no prospect of any  of
      the appellant's conditions improving and the focus has inevitably been
      upon managing his conditions, without any expectation  of  improvement
      beyond the short-term, for the period he has remaining.  As  Dr  Thwin
      put it: "There is no chance of his health condition improving  but  he
      will survive for a certain period by continuing his  current  dialysis
      regimen treatments."  Dr Thwin described the prognosis  of  the  chest
      condition as poor, and that any improvements as "short lived".  I note
      that in his statement dated 30 November 2020 the appellant  claims  he
      was given five years to live and has been on dialysis  for  10  years.
      The appellant has stated that his life has been prolonged  because  of
      the care and support he gets in the UK but  there  is  no  independent
      evidence in support of this.

  47. The appellant's likely life expectancy remains uncertain.  However his
      medical history suggests that with continued access  to  "his  current
      dialysis regimen treatments" he will be able to  survive  well  beyond
      the short term.  This is therefore not a case in which it can be  said
      that the appellant has a defined limited short period left to live  or
      a defined even shorter life expectancy in Pakistan.  Rather,  provided
      he is able to access dialysis and  the  medication  required  for  his
      kidney disease and chest condition, the prognosis seems to be that  he
      will be able to survive for an unknown period.  That applies  just  as
      much to Pakistan as it does in the UK.

  48. Having viewed all the evidence in the round, I am satisfied  that  the
      appellant will have the benefit of the  support,  both  financial  and
      emotional, of his family members in the UK, as well as the support  of
      family members in Pakistan.  Dialysis  would  be  both  available  and
      accessible to the appellant in Arifwala.   Adhoc medical expenses  can
      be met by remittances from the family in the UK.   The  appellant  and
      his family members have accepted that  he  has  a  limited  time  left
      (albeit that period is uncertain).  This means that the need  to  send
      remittances will not be for an indefinite period.  Given the  evidence
      as to availability of treatment together  with  support  in  Arifwala,
      combined with financial support from the UK,  the  appellant  has  not
      displaced the initial burden in this case.  I do not accept  that  the
      appellant's removal would lead to a serious,  rapid  and  irreversible
      decline in his state of health resulting in intense suffering or to  a
      significant reduction in  life  expectancy.   I  do  not  accept  that
      arrangements cannot be made by the appellant working together with his
      family members, given the facilities in  Arifwala,  so  as  to  ensure
      there is no risk of  missing  a  single  dialysis  session,  including
      shortly after  his  arrival  in  Pakistan  and  bearing  in  mind  the
      challenges posed by the pandemic.  I  have  carefully  considered  the
      likelihood of the appellant's treatment being  interrupted  but  there
      are a number of protective mechanisms available to him: three possible
      hospitals in easy travelling distance; many family members in Pakistan
      and the UK available to assist; financial backing from family  members
      in the UK; the appellant is experienced in looking after himself  with
      the support of family members, having been ill for an  extended  time,
      during which time he has been entirely compliant with his treatment.

  49. I accept Mr Anderson's submission that the appellant has  been  unable
      to place reliance upon sufficient cogent country  background,  medical
      or other evidence to establish a prima facie case.  I have no  serious
      doubts surrounding the impact of  removal  and  in  the  circumstances
      there was no obligation on the part  of  the  respondent  to  seek  an
      individual assurance from the government of Pakistan.

  50. I am satisfied that whilst the appellant may have a  more  comfortable
      standard of living in the UK including more  fulfilling  relationships
      with his children and grandchildren, his return to Pakistan would  not
      breach Article 3.   I  am  not  determining  whether  the  appellant's
      removal would breach Article 8 because that has already  been  finally
      decided by the FTT.  The threshold  for  a  breach  of  Article  3  by
      removing a person to their state of origin remains a high one.  In the
      circumstances of this case, there is sufficient  evidence  as  to  the
      availability  and  accessibility  of  dialysis  and  other   treatment
      together with  family  support  in  Arifwala,  such  that  removal  to
      Pakistan would not give rise to a real risk of a breach of Article  3.



Fitness to fly

  51. It has not been submitted on behalf of the appellant  that  travelling
      to Pakistan would breach Article 3.  In any event such a submission is
      currently unsupported by the medical evidence.  Dr Thwin  stated  that
      in her opinion the appellant is not fit to fly  without  offering  any
      detailed reasons for this.  Dr Ionescu  observed  that,  from  a  lung
      point of view, his fitness to fly would need to be assessed  close  to
      the time of  departure.  The  Appellant's  fitness  to  fly  would  be
      assessed as part of the removal process and, if necessary, he would be
      provided with the appropriate medical escorts.

Conclusion

  52. The appellant's removal to Pakistan would not give rise to a breach of
      Article 3 of the ECHR.

Decision

  53. The appellant's appeal is dismissed on human rights grounds.
