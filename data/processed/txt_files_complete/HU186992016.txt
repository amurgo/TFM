For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

   1. The Appellant is a citizen of Somalia born on 15th of  February  1989.
      He appeals against a decision of  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
      Eldridge sitting at Harmondsworth on 16th of August 2017 who dismissed
      the Appellant's appeal against a decision of the Respondent dated  1st
      of July 2016. That decision was to refuse the Appellant's  application
      for leave to enter the United Kingdom  as  the  partner  of  a  person
      present and settled here. The Appellant wished to  join  his  wife  Ms
      Hindiya Ali a British citizen of Somali heritage (the Sponsor).


   2. The Sponsor was born on 1st of January 1990 in Mogadishu, Somalia. She
      entered the United Kingdom on 30th of September 2006 and  was  granted
      indefinite leave to enter and remain and thereafter naturalised  as  a
      British citizen in 2009. The Appellant and the Sponsor were married in
      accordance with Sharia law and custom on 27th of  November  2015,  the
      Sponsor returning to the United  Kingdom  on  22nd  of  December  2015
      because  of  work  commitments.  In  her  statement  made  for   these
      proceedings at first instance dated 8th of August 2017  she  said  she
      had been unable to travel to see the Appellant since then. As  at  the
      date of the statement she had two jobs, one as a carer and  the  other
      as a shop assistant working part-time. Her accommodation consisted  of
      a one bedroom flat  privately  rented.  She  had  sent  money  to  the
      Appellant and produced money transfer receipts.


   3. The Appellant had  travelled  to  Kampala  in  Uganda  to  submit  the
      application for entry clearance. Certain  documents  had  subsequently
      been lost by the Respondent in transit  between  the  entry  clearance
      posts in Pretoria and Kampala.  The Respondent refused the application
      considering that the  Appellant  had  not  shown  he  could  meet  the
      financial requirements of Appendix FM of the  Immigration  Rules  with
      the documents specified in Appendix FM-SE of the rules. The Respondent
      also considered that the Appellant could not meet the English language
      test requirement. No other issues were taken under the rules.

The Decision at First Instance

   4. The Judge accepted that the Appellant and Sponsor were partners within
      the meaning of Appendix FM and  their  relationship  was  genuine  and
      subsisting. The Appellant had submitted a certificate showing that  he
      had passed the English language test although his application form had
      applied for exemption from the language  requirement  on  the  grounds
      that there was no  entry  clearance  post  in  Somalia.  The  language
      certificate was dated 29th of July 2016 after the refusal  four  weeks
      earlier on 1st of July  2016.  The  reason  it  was  dated  after  the
      decision was because the original certificate which had shown the test
      date as 9th of April 2016 had been lost by the Respondent.  The  Judge
      accepted that the test certificate was genuine and that the  Appellant
      had taken and passed the English language test on 9th of April 2016.


   5. That left the second objection which was that the Appellant could  not
      show he met the financial requirement of an annual income of  �18,600.
      This had to be demonstrated  for  the  six  months  qualifying  period
      between October 2015 and March  2016  through  payslips  supported  by
      appropriate bank statements and a letter from an  employer  confirming
      employment and salary. Only five payslips were produced to  the  Judge
      all in the  identical  sum  of  �554.64  p.  This  did  not  meet  the
      requirements of six payslips and it was not possible to see any of the
      net sums concerned being paid into any bank account. The  only  letter
      available from the employer was dated 17th  of  July  2017  after  the
      refusal, there was no such letter with the application. The  Sponsor's
      employer Yusra Limited was unlikely to pay the Sponsor  in  cash  when
      she held a bank account. The Judge did not accept that this employment
      was genuine or that the claimed remuneration was paid and received.


   6. The Sponsor's main employer was said to be a company  called  Sevacare
      limited. A letter from the branch manager dated 25th of February  2016
      did not state the rate of remuneration for the Sponsor's employment as
      it was meant to. Although there were payslips for the  period  between
      October 2015 and March 2016 there were no payslips for  the  beginning
      of March 2016. The Sponsor was paid  on  a  strict  four-weekly  basis
      rather than per calendar month. It was  not  possible  from  the  bank
      statements to trace any payment in for the first pay slip  dated  13th
      of October 2015. The evidence rules for this employment were  not  met
      either. The application failed under the financial provisions  of  the
      Immigration Rules.


   7. The Judge went on to consider  the  appeal  outside  the  rules  under
      Article  8  taking  into  account  section  117B  of  the  Nationality
      Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002.  That  the  Respondent  had  lost
      documents submitted with the application was not  in  this  particular
      case a material factor since documents such as an employer's letter or
      wages information could have been duplicated in time  for  the  appeal
      but that had not happened. There was a distinction  between  financial
      documents and the loss of the English language test certificate. There
      was family life between the Appellant and the Sponsor and the decision
      to refuse entry clearance  interfered  with  that  family  life  being
      developed but the issue was the proportionality of  the  interference.
      There was no economic self-sufficiency under section 117B and  it  was
      not disproportionate to expect this couple who had married in the face
      of the Appellant's nationality  and  lack  of  immigration  status  to
      demonstrate clearly that they  could  meet  the  requirements  of  the
      rules. There were no additional factors of a  compelling  nature  that
      would warrant further consideration outside the  rules.  He  dismissed
      the appeal.

The Onward Appeal

   8. The Appellant appealed against this decision arguing that the  Sponsor
      had two employments and had  provided  payslips  for  both.  The  bank
      statement did  not  show  the  income  received  because  the  Sponsor
      received cash in hand. The grounds also dealt with the  issue  of  the
      English language test certificate although as the Judge had  found  in
      the  Appellant's  favour  that  was  not   strictly   necessary.   The
      Respondent, the  grounds  argued,  had  been  very  careless  and  had
      misplaced the Appellant's and Sponsor's documentation.


   9. The Respondent should have first seen whether the Appellant could meet
      the Immigration  Rules  but  if  the  Appellant  could  not  then  the
      Respondent should have considered the 2nd stage Article 8 claim  on  a
      freestanding basis. The decision to permanently separate a husband and
      wife undermined the spirit of Article 8.


  10. The application for permission to appeal came  on  the  papers  before
      Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Boyes on 11th of October 2017. In  an
      extremely brief decision he granted permission writing:  "The  grounds
      assert that the Judge reached incorrect  conclusions  in  relation  to
      Article 8. The grounds  are  arguable  and  permission  to  appeal  is
      granted".


  11. The Respondent replied to this grant on 9th of November  2017  writing
      that it was a not at all clear why Judge Boyes had given permission to
      appeal. Such a brief grant was contrary to the guidance given  in  the
      case of MR [2015] UKUT 29. It was unsatisfactory merely to state  that
      the grounds were arguable. In any event Judge Eldridge had  considered
      the evidence and found that the requirements of Appendix FM and  FM-SE
      were not met. It would not be disproportionate for  the  Appellant  to
      have to make a further application. There were no material  errors  of
      law in the determination.

The Hearing Before Me

  12. For the Appellant, it was argued that this was not a usual  case.  The
      Judge  had  made  a  finding  of  a  genuine  relationship.   It   was
      disproportionate to expect the couple  to  demonstrate  they  met  the
      requirements of the rules as there was a financial dependency in  this
      case. This was an Article 8 appeal. The Sponsor  had  two  sources  of
      income and payslips to support that. Her average salary per  week  was
      �244.86 p which was  above  the  income  support  level.  The  English
      language test requirement was met.


13. For the Respondent, it was argued that the Appellant could not meet the
    Rules and that was the Judge's starting point. The Appellant's argument
    in this case as to dependency  if  correct  would  make  the  financial
    requirements of the Immigration Rules pointless. There needed to be  an
    evidential basis for the demonstration of an income level.  That  level
    had been challenged in the higher courts  who,  broadly  speaking,  had
    found in favour of the Respondent. There was no material error  of  law
    by the Judge and no reason to go outside the terms  of  the  Rules.  As
    there was no issue of deception here, once the Sponsor could prove  she
    met the Rules there  would  be  nothing  to  stop  the  Appellant  from
    applying again with fresh evidence. At the conclusion of submissions, I
    reserved my decision.

Findings

  14. Although this was an appeal under Article 8 it was important  for  the
      Judge to establish whether the Appellant could meet  the  requirements
      of the Immigration Rules and for the reasons he gave he found that the
      Appellant could not meet those requirements because the  documentation
      to support the Sponsor's income was unsatisfactory.  Before  me  there
      was not  a  substantive  challenge  to  that  finding,  the  Appellant
      appeared to be arguing that where there was evidence of a  dependency,
      in this case the Sponsor remitting money to the Appellant  in  Somalia
      and/or Uganda, a dependency arose and the  financial  requirements  of
      Appendix FM no longer applied. This is not correct,  the  requirements
      of Appendix FM do apply in a case such as this.


  15. The Judge did not accept that the Appellant's financial  documentation
      was at all adequate. One of the major problems was  that  the  Sponsor
      could not match her income to her bank statement entries. That  was  a
      matter for the Judge to draw a conclusion upon and  I  find  that  his
      reasoning in this respect was cogent and  sufficient  for  the  losing
      party to be aware of why they lost. It was perhaps unhelpful that  the
      grant of permission to appeal was so brief particularly as it did  not
      distinguish between the Article 8 argument which was not  accepted  by
      the Judge at first instance and the  issue  of  the  English  language
      certificate which had been accepted.


  16. The grant of permission did not deal with the point made by the  Judge
      that the loss of documents by the Respondent did not materially affect
      the consideration of the appeal because the  sort  of  documents  that
      were lost could be relatively easily duplicated. Be that as it may the
      onus was on the Appellant to show a  material  error  of  law  in  the
      Judge's determination. I find that that has not been demonstrated.  If
      the Sponsor has adequate financial documentation which shows that  she
      can meet the income requirement of �18,600 there is no undue  hardship
      upon the Appellant to reapply. This was a point made by the  Judge  at
      paragraph 32 of his determination and echoed in the Respondent's reply
      to the grant of permission.


17. Given that the Judge had found that the Immigration Rules could not  be
    met there was then significant weight on the  Respondent  side  of  the
    scales when  looking  at  the  matter  outside  Article  8  during  the
    proportionality exercise. As the jurisprudence has made clear,  see  SS
    Congo [2015] EWCA Civ 387 approved in the Supreme Court,  for  example,
    very compelling circumstances need to be shown in  an  out  of  country
    appeal why the interference with protected rights outweighs the  public
    interest in immigration control. The Judge at first  instance  did  not
    found that the public interest was outweighed and that was a conclusion
    open to him on the evidence. The Sponsor was evidently able  to  travel
    out to Somalia to meet and marry the Appellant and family life could be
    continued elsewhere. The reluctance of a UK based Sponsor to travel  to
    the applicant's country of origin is not of itself  a  good  reason  to
    allow an appeal, see Agyarko  [2015]  EWCA  Civ  440  approved  in  the
    Supreme Court  at  [2017]  UKSC  11.  There  were  no  very  compelling
    circumstances in this case as the Judge correctly identified and I find
    no material error of law in the Judge's decision to dismiss the appeal.
    I therefore dismiss the onward appeal.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve  the  making  of  an
    error of law and I uphold  the  decision  to  dismiss  the  Appellant's
    appeal
Appellant's appeal dismissed


I make no anonymity order as there is no public policy reason for so doing.
