Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr Jafar, Counsel instructed by Mayfair Solicitors,
Hounslow
For the Respondent:    Mr T Wilding, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellants are citizens of India whose dates of birth are  recorded
    as 27th August 1987 and 23rd July 1984 respectively.  On 29th May  2012
    the First Appellant was granted limited leave to remain in  the  United
    Kingdom until 29th 2014.   On  15th  May  2014  she  made  an  in  time
    application for variation of her leave.  However a decision was made to
    refuse the application, dependent as it was upon  the  success  of  the
    Second  Appellant's  application.   The  decision  made  reference   to
    paragraph 319E of HC 395 (as amended) which provides that in  the  case
    of an application for indefinite leave to remain as the  partner  of  a
    relevant points-based system migrant, an applicant  must  meet  certain
    requirements which essentially include her partner's application  being
    successful. Pursuant to Section  47  of  the  Immigration,  Asylum  and
    Nationality Act 2006 a decision was  also  made  to  remove  the  First
    Appellant in line with her partner.  Although no  point  was  taken,  I
    note that the decision itself appears undated.

 2. The history of the Second  Appellant  is  important.   He  entered  the
    United  Kingdom  on  2nd  October  2006.   Further  leave  was  granted
    following various applications until on 15th May 2014  he  made  an  in
    time application for leave to remain under  the  settlement  provisions
    for Tier 1 (General) Migrant visas  (under  the  points-based  system).
    This was however, refused.  In refusing the application  the  Secretary
    of State placed reliance on paragraph 322(1A) and 322(2) of HC 395  (as
    amended).  The Secretary of State upon making enquiries which gave  the
    Secretary of State grounds for believing that  the  Second  Appellant's
    declared earnings of ï¿½30,799 were significantly less.  It was his  case
    that in error, he had not declared a second income.

 3. The Appellants and each of them appealed to the First-tier Tribunal and
    on 20th February 2015 the matter came before Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Suffield-Thompson sitting at Columbus House, Newport.  Placing
    the burden of proof upon the Appellants and accepting  the  submissions
    made on behalf of the Respondent that paragraph 322(1A) did not require
    an intention to deceive, notwithstanding  finding  that  there  was  no
    deliberate falsehood by the Appellants, the judge went  on  to  dismiss
    the appeals.

 4. Not content with those decisions, by Notice dated 16th March  2015  the
    Appellants made application for  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal.  On 4th May 2015 Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  McDade
    granted permission thus the matter comes before me.

 5. Paragraph 322(1A) provides:

         "Where false representations have been made or false  documents  or
         information have been submitted (whether or  not  material  to  the
         application, and whether or not to the applicant's  knowledge),  or
         material  facts  have  not  been  disclosed,  in  relation  to  the
         application or in order to obtain documents from the  Secretary  of
         State or a third party required in support of the application",

    refusal of leave to remain, variation of leave to enter  or  remain  or
    curtailment of leave applications are to be refused.

 6.  Both  Mr  Jafar  and  Mr  Wilding  agreed  that  there  had   been   a
    misapplication of the law  by  the  judge.   At  paragraph  34  of  the
    statement of reasons there was a clear finding that there had  been  no
    deliberate falsehood by the Appellants.

 7. The Upper Tribunal in  FW  (Paragraph  322:  untruthful  answer)  Kenya
    [2010] UKUT 164 had stated that:

         "When a direct question is asked, and answered untruthfully,  there
         is both a false representation and a non-disclosure; and it is  not
         open to an Appellant who gives an untruthful  answer  to  a  direct
         question in an application form to say  that  the  matter  was  not
         material".

    However, the Grounds of Appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal  quite  properly
    point to the guidance of the Court of Appeal  in  A  -v-  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department [2010] EWCA Civ 773 in which the Court of
    Appeal was clear that dishonesty had  to  be  established.   Given  the
    finding by the judge that there had been no dishonesty the Secretary of
    State's contentions under paragraph  322(1A)  and  322(2),  the  burden
    being upon her, were clearly not made out.

 8. That error impacts on the judge's findings at paragraph 43 in which was
    said,

        "The Appellant has been here for ten years  but  I  find  that  the
         Appellant [Second Appellant] is not able to  apply  for  indefinite
         leave under the ten year  Rule  as  he  did  not  qualify  for  the
         appropriate  points  in  2012  due  to  the  discrepancies  in  his
         documentation submitted to the HMRC and the Respondent".

 9. Again both Mr Jafar and Mr Wilding were in agreement that the judge was
    simply  wrong.   The  Second  Appellant  had  demonstrated  ten  years'
    continuous residence because there was no finding  open  to  the  judge
    which would have broken the period of continuity.

10. I am satisfied that there has been a  material  error  of  law  in  the
    Statement of Reasons.  The appeals to the  Upper  Tribunal  are  to  be
    allowed. The Decisions of the First-tier Tribunal  are  set  aside  and
    remade such that they are allowed on the basis that  the  Decisions  of
    the Secretary of  State  are  not  in  accordance  with  the  law.  The
    Secretary of State will need to consider paragraphs 276B and  276A1  of
    the Immigration Rules.

11. Without the Secretary of State having considered the  position  of  the
    Second Appellant any decision in relation to the First  Appellant  also
    cannot stand and so too, for the  avoidance  of  doubt  her  appeal  is
    remade on the same basis.

Notice of Decision

The appeals to the Upper Tribunal are allowed.  The decisions of the  First-
tier Tribunal in relation to each Appellant are set aside  and  remade  such
that they are allowed on the basis that the Decisions of  the  Secretary  of
State are not in accordance with the law.

Signed                              Date

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As incorrect information was given to the Secretary of State justifying  her
putting the Appellants to proof I have decided not to make any award.
