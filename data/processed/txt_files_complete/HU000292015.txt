                            DECISION AND REASONS







BACKGROUND TO THE APPEAL
1.   The Respondent, who was born on 24 September 1975,  is  a  national  of
    Jamaica.

2.   First-tier Tribunal Judge Griffith allowed his appeal  in  a  decision,
    promulgated on 11 September 2017. The Appellant appealed and First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Phillips refused her permission to appeal on 17  October
    2017. The Appellant renewed her application to the Upper  Tribunal  and
    on  30  November  2017  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Rimington  granted  her
    permission.

ERROR OF LAW HEARING
3.   Both the Home Office Presenting Officer and counsel for the  Respondent
     made oral submissions and I have referred  to  the  content  of  these
    submissions, where relevant, in my decision below.

ERROR OF LAW DECISION
4.   Upper Tribunal Judge Rimington found that it was arguable  that  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Griffith had failed to  consider  the  weight  that
    should be afforded to the public interest and  that  the  reasoning  in
    relation to whether the Respondent's deportation would result in unduly
    harsh circumstances for his partner  and  children  was  incomplete  or
    inadequate.

5.   At the  hearing  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  the  Appellant  had
    accepted that the Respondent had  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
    relationship with his partner and their three children.

6.   In paragraph 52 of her decision  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  also
    reminded herself that the deportation of a foreign criminal is  in  the
    public interest and the more serious  the  offending  the  greater  the
    public interest in deporting him.  She also noted that in MM (Uganda) v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2016]  EWCA  Civ  450  the
    Court of Appeal had found that "the expression "unduly harsh"  requires
    regard to be had to all  the  circumstances  including  the  criminal's
    immigration and criminal history".

7.   At paragraph 55 she also reminded  himself  that  in  paragraph  50  of
    Hesham Ali v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016] UKSC  60
    it was held that
         "The critical issue for the Tribunal  will  generally  be  whether,
         giving due weight to the strength of the  public  interest  in  the
         deportation of the offender in the case before it,  the  Article  8
         claim is sufficiently strong to outweigh it.  In  general,  only  a
         claim which is very strong indeed - very compelling, as it was  put
         in MF (Nigeria) - will succeed".


8.   She also reminded herself that in Rexha  (S.117C  -  earlier  offences)
    [2016] UKUT 00335 (IAC) the Upper Tribunal found that:

         "The purpose and intention of Parliament in  incorporating  section
         117C of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  was  to
         ensure that all of the criminal convictions providing a reason  for
         the deportation decision are to be examined  within  the  framework
         provided by that section.


         What is required when undertaking the exercise required by sections
         117C(1) to (6) is careful scrutiny of those offences which are on a
         person's criminal record which  have  provided  a  reason  for  the
         decision to deport".

9.   Therefore, it was necessary to take into account the  totality  of  the
    Respondent's criminal history and not just his more recent offences.

10.  Between 7 November 2007 and 20 May 2009 the  Respondent  was  cautioned
    for possession of cannabis, fined �200 for possession of a Class C  and
    a Class A drug, fined �75 for possession of a Class C drug and given  a
    conditional discharge for obstructing a drugs search. On 22  July  2009
    he was sentenced to three years and four months  imprisonment  for  the
    supply of Class A drugs.  This led to a deportation order being  signed
    against him on 20 January 2011 but his subsequent appeal was allowed on
    Article 8 grounds and his deportation order was revoked on 26 September
    2011 and on 30 September 2011 he was  granted  discretionary  leave  to
    remain until 29 March 2012.

11.   In  addition,  on  13  May  2013  the  Respondent  was  cautioned  for
    possessing cannabis, on 6  February  2014  he  received  a  conditional
    discharge for possession of cannabis and on  9  December  2015  he  was
    fined and disqualified  for  13.5  months  for  failing  to  provide  a
    specimen.

12.  First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Griffith  referred  to  these  offences  in
    detail in paragraphs 4 to 7 of her decision. She  then  considered  the
    weight to be given to the various offences in paragraphs 59 and  60  of
    her decision and also reminded himself of the sentencing  remarks  made
    in 2009 when the Respondent was sentenced to imprisonment.

13.  In paragraph 61 she then stated that:


         "... in order to  assess  proportionality  I  have  considered  the
         countervailing factors. The  appellant  has  not  been  in  trouble
         arising from any drugs offences since 2014 and there is no evidence
         before me that today he presents a risk to the public.  As  to  his
         immigration  history,  he  has  not   overstayed   and   has   made
         applications for leave which have been granted. It  also  took  the
         respondent three years to decide the  appellant's  application  for
         further leave. In EB (Kosovo) the court referred to the development
         of close personal and social ties during a period  of  delay  which
         could serve to strengthen an  Article  8  claim.  Furthermore,  the
         delay in taking action to deport him must serve as an indication of
         the lack of any pressing public interest in doing so".


14.  The First-tier Tribunal Judge then explained in  paragraphs  63  to  68
    why it would be unduly harsh to deport the Respondent  relying  on  the
    very strong and compelling features relating to his family life,  which
    included the fact that his children were all British, he had  played  a
    central role in their lives, his partner would struggle to  effectively
    parent them without him and Romeo, in particular, would be risk if  the
    Respondent was absent. Therefore, I  do  not  accept  the  Home  Office
    Presenting Officer's submission that First-tier Tribunal Judge Griffith
    had failed to apply the substance of the case law referred  to.  It  is
    also my view that the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge's  findings  on  best
    interests in paragraph 66 of her decision were merely  a  part  of  her
    overall balancing exercise and not a substitution for such an exercise.



15.  As a consequence, I  find  that  the  decision  reached  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Griffith was one that was open to her  on  the  evidence
    before her and in light of current case law although  it  was  not  one
    which all First-tier Tribunal Judges would have reached. Therefore, she
    did not err in law in her decision.


DECISION

(1)  The Appellant's appeal is dismissed.

(2)  First-tier Tribunal Judge Griffith's decision is upheld.
