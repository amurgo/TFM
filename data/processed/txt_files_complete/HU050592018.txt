Associates Limited


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

 1. The appellant in  this  appeal  is  the  Secretary  of  State  and  the
    respondent is Mr Abdullah.  However for the purposes of this decision I
    refer to the parties as they were before the First-tier Tribunal  where
    Mr Abdullah was the appellant.

 2. The appellant, a citizen of Pakistan born on 20 December 1977  appealed
    to the First-tier Tribunal against a decision of the respondent dated 9
    February 2018 to refuse the appellant's human rights application.

 3. In a decision promulgated on 30 October 2018, Judge of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal I F Taylor allowed the  appellant's  appeal  on  human  rights
    grounds, taking into consideration TZ (Pakistan) and PG [2018] EWCA Civ
    1109 in particular paragraph 34 that:

         "Where a person satisfies the Rules ...  this  will  be  positively
         determinative of that person's Article  8  appeal,  provided  their
         case engages Article 8(1), for the very reason  that  it  would  be
         disproportionate for that person to be removed."

 4. The issue in this appeal was the  respondent's  reliance  on  paragraph
    322(5) of the general grounds for refusal which provides:

         "Grounds on which leave to remain and variation of leave  to  enter
         or  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  should  normally  be  refused
         [include] the undesirability of permitting the person concerned  to
         remain in the United Kingdom in the light of his conduct (including
         convictions which do not fall within paragraph  322(1C),  character
         or associations or the fact that he represents a threat to national
         security."

 5. The respondent refused  the  appellant's  application  under  paragraph
    322(5) because, as part of the appellant's Tier 1  (General)  leave  to
    remain application of 23 March 2011, the appellant claimed to  have  an
    income of �57,159 from all sources between 3 March 2010 and 20 February
    2011, from self-employment.  On this basis the appellant was awarded 35
    points under the previous earnings category towards the ultimate  total
    of 80 points in order to be  granted  leave  to  remain  under  Tier  1
    (General).

 6. The respondent noted that the tax calculation for 2010/2011 showed that
    the appellant actually declared a total income of  �29,039  from  self-
    employment and the respondent noted that  the  appellant's  application
    would have been refused if he had declared  that  income  or  submitted
    this level of earnings in his Tier 1 application.

 7. The Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  ultimately  concluded  that  the
    respondent had failed to meet the burden  of  establishing  dishonesty.
    The Secretary of State appeals with permission on the grounds that  the
    judge erred in  making  a  perverse  or  irrational  finding  that  the
    appellant had not employed dishonesty in declaring his earnings to  the
    respondent in circumstances where the judge found  that  the  appellant
    had employed an element of creative accounting; and had made a material
    misdirection of law in finding the threshold for invoking 322(5) of the
    Rules was not met.

Error of Law Discussion

 8. Paragraph 322(5) of the General Grounds for Refusal provides:

         'Grounds on which leave to remain and variation of leave  to  enter
         or  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  should  normally  be  refused
         [include] the undesirability of permitting the person concerned  to
         remain in the United Kingdom in the light of his conduct (including
         convictions which do not fall within Paragraph 322 (1C)), character
         or associations or the fact that he represents a threat to national
         security;'

 9. The judge set out the respondent's  arguments  in  the  refusal  letter
    together with the appellant's explanation.  The appellant  acknowledged
    that there appeared  to  be  a  discrepancy;  it  was  the  appellant's
    argument, at paragraph 14 of his witness statement, that  he  did  earn
    �57,159 in the tax year 2010/2011 which is why he declared that as  his
    income when he applied for leave to remain on 23 March 2011.   However,
    as he had made a loss of �28,120 in the tax year  2009/2010  his  first
    year of trading he was, under HMRC rules, permitted to carry that  loss
    forward and reduce his taxable income for the purposes of his 2010/2011
    tax return.  This  resulted  in  a  taxable  income  for  2010/2011  of
    �29,039.

10. The appellant relied on the documents provided in his bundle  including
    his tax return of 2010/2011 (at pages 19 to 27) and this notes, at page
    25 under paragraph 20 of the  tax  return,  that  his  business  income
    profit was �57,159.  The appellant set  out  how  he  had  subsequently
    taken off the loss in the previous year,  leaving  taxable  profits  of
    �29,039.

11. The judge  took  into  consideration  a  letter  from  the  appellant's
    accountant Sam & Co at pages 30 to 31 of  the  bundle  which  confirmed
    that the appellant had made a financial loss in the year  2009/2010  to
    the tune of �28,120 and under HMRC rules he was allowed to  carry  this
    forward in the following fiscal year when  he  made  a  net  profit  of
    �57,159.  The letter confirms that "Although  the  taxable  profit  was
    �29,039 the business' profit was �57,159".

12. The judge went on to find as follows:

         "12. The issues before me are clearly complex and it is a matter of
             some significance that  the  only  evidence  from  a  firm  of
             accountants is provided  by  the  appellant.   The  respondent
             relies upon a document dealing with Appendix A - attributes of
             the Immigration Rules which states, amongst many other things,
             in  a  paragraph  headed  "earnings"  at  paragraph   15   the
             following.  "Where the earnings are the profits of a  business
             derived through self-employment or other  business  activities
             the earnings that will be assessed  are  the  profits  of  the
             business before tax.   It  was  suggested  by  the  respondent
             during the hearing that this does not include  losses  carried
             forward which is permitted by HMRC.

         13.  It is not entirely clear to me whether that is so or  not  but
             even if it were the case that previous year's losses could  be
             carried forward  in  respect  of  HMRC,  but  as  far  as  the
             Immigration Rules are concerned could not, in any  event  this
             falls substantially short of the legal burden  which  is  upon
             the respondent in the circumstances and it doesn't go anywhere
             near establishing fraud or deception.   Similarly  (it  wasn't
             argued) but it could have been, the appellant was under a duty
             to reveal that  previous  losses  had  been  carried  forward,
             however, taken individually or collectively  would  not  reach
             anywhere near the required level.  As stated by the  appellant
             it must be of some significance that  the  claimed  income  of
             �57,159 would be sufficient  to  obtain  indefinite  leave  to
             remain whereas the declared income of �29,039 would  not.   It
             may be, and I go no further than that, that in this case there
             may be an element of creative accountancy which nonetheless is
             not unlawful."

13. The judge concluded, at [16], that for the reasons given the respondent
    had fallen a long way short of meeting the burden upon them.

14. Mr Lindsay attempted to  introduce  additional  grounds,  including  in
    arguing that the judge materially erred in  law  in  referring  to  the
    document Appendix A - Attributes as "a document dealing  with  Appendix
    A" whereas this was part of the Immigration Rules.  Even  if  this  new
    ground were properly before  me,  which  I  am  not  satisfied  it  was
    established  it  was,  I  am  not  satisfied  that  any  error  in  the
    characterisation of the  document  was  material  as  the  judge  fully
    considered this document.

15. Mr Lindsay further suggested that the  grounds  included  the  argument
    that the judge had erred in what he said at the end of [12]; it was  Mr
    Lindsay's submission that the judge had failed to apply paragraph 15 of
    the "Appendix A - attributes of the Immigration Rules".  Contrary to Mr
    Lindsay's submission, the ground alleging irrational findings at ground
    1 related specifically to an assertion that the judge, in finding  that
    the appellant had employed "creative accountancy",  reached  irrational
    findings in going on to find that he had not been dishonest.  I am  not
    satisfied that there was any ground before me in relation to a  failure
    to properly apply paragraph 15  of  Appendix  A  -  attributes  of  the
    Immigration Rules, despite  Mr  Lindsay's  attempts  to  shoehorn  such
    arguments into the existing grounds.  Even if there were, such was  not
    made out.

16. Mr Lindsay could not say what it was that the judge had failed to apply
    and I take into consideration that the  judge  specifically  considered
    the  evidence  from  the  accountant  that  the  "business  profit  was
    �57,159".  This is in line  with  what  is  said  in  paragraph  15  of
    Appendix A - Attributes, that the earnings that will be  assessed  "are
    the profits of the business before tax".

17. As correctly identified by the judge  it  was  for  the  respondent  to
    identify that the prima facie case of dishonesty had  been  established
    and then for the appellant to provide an innocent explanation.  It  was
    open to the judge to find a prima facie case had not  been  established
    including in relying,  as  the  judge  did,  on  all  of  the  evidence
    including the  appellant's  oral  evidence  and  the  evidence  of  his
    accountant, as reflected in his tax return, that  the  business  profit
    was �57,159.

18. I am not satisfied in addition that there was any  material  error,  as
    further asserted by Mr Lindsay (in another issue not previously  raised
    by the Secretary of  State)  in  failing  to  resolve  the  meaning  of
    paragraph 15 Appendix A - Attributes.  It was  for  the  respondent  to
    discharge the burden of proof in relation to dishonesty and  the  judge
    gave adequate reasons for being satisfied that that burden had not been
    discharged.

19. In relation to the grounds that were before me, although much was  made
    of the judge's statement that "in this case there may be an element  of
    creative accountancy" the judge went on to state that this "nonetheless
    is not unlawful".  The judge's use of the phrase "creative accountancy"
    is somewhat unfortunate, particularly as the  judge  did  not  actually
    definitively find that there was "creative accountancy" and  was  quite
    clear in his findings that there was no dishonesty in this case and the
    potential.  Reading the decision fairly and holistically, the reference
    to creative accountancy, coming as it did after a discussion of whether
    the appellant was entitled for tax  but  not  immigration  purposes  to
    carry forward losses, would appear to be referring to  the  appellant's
    ability, in his tax affairs, to use his previous tax losses  to  reduce
    his future tax liability (which  the  appellant  had  demonstrated  was
    permitted by HMRC) rather than, as characterised by the respondent,  an
    attempt to mislead  the  respondent  in  relation  to  his  immigration
    applications.

20. I do not agree with Mr Lindsay's assertion that this mere reference  to
    possible creative accountancy indicates that the judge considered  that
    the appellant had acted dishonestly, when in fact the  judge  made  the
    opposite finding.  Such findings were  open  to  him  on  the  evidence
    including, the appellant's evidence which the judge accepted,  his  tax
    returns, and the evidence of the accountant.

21. Even if the judge was wrong,  as  argued  in  the  respondent's  second
    ground, in concluding that the prima facie case for dishonesty had  not
    been made out, which I am not satisfied has been established, any  such
    claimed error could not be material as it is evident from  the  judge's
    findings that he accepted, as honest, the appellant's explanation as to
    why a taxable  income  of  �29,039  had  been  declared  for  2010/2011
    including that this  was  supported  by  the  documents  including  the
    appellant's tax return and the evidence from his accountants.  Such  an
    approach, in the alternative, in finding an innocent  explanation  (and
    the judge refers to such an 'innocent explanation' at [10]) is in  line
    with current guidance (see R (on the application of Khan)  v  Secretary
    of State for the Home Department  (Dishonesty,  tax  return,  paragraph
    322(5)) [2018] UKUT 00384).

22. Whilst the judge's comment on "creative accountancy" may not have  been
    particularly helpful it is not an error of law and looking at  all  the
    evidence, as the judge did, it was not a case of the appellant  failing
    to declare the income or of falsely inflating  his  income  but  rather
    that having made a business income of �57,159, he used a previous  loss
    to reduce his tax liabilities, which the judge  accepted  the  evidence
    showed he was permitted to do for tax purposes.   That  is  a  separate
    issue.  The judge was entitled to find, for the evidence-based  reasons
    he  gave,  that  the  respondent  had  failed  to  establish  that  the
    appellant's conduct fell within paragraph 322(5).

23. I am not satisfied that the grounds are made out.  The decision of  the
    First-tier Tribunal does not contain an error of law and shall stand.

No anonymity direction was sought or is made.
