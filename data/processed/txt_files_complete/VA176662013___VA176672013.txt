For the Appellants:    The Sponsor in person
For the Respondent:    Mr P Duffy, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The Appellants are citizens of Sudan born respectively on 19th  October
    1980 and 1st January 1978.  They applied for entry clearance to  visit
    their  mutual  brother,  Dr Azhari  Elsoni-Ali,  the  Sponsor.   Those
    applications were refused for reasons given in Notices of Refusal dated
    16th July 2013.  The Appellants appealed, and their appeals were  heard
    by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Courtney  (the  Judge)  sitting  at
    Richmond on 6th June 2014.  He decided to allow  the  appeals  for  the
    reasons given in his Determination dated 8th June 2014.  The Respondent
    sought leave to appeal that  decision,  and  on  26th  June  2014  such
    permission was granted.

Error of Law

 2. I must first decide if the decision of the Judge contained an error  on
    a point of law so that it should be set aside.

 3. The grounds upon which leave to  appeal  was  granted  state  that  the
    Appellants made their applications for  entry  clearance  on  9th  July
    2013.   That  being  the  case,  the  appeals  should  only  have  been
    considered on the limited grounds  allowed  by  Section 52  Crime  and
    Courts Act 2013, which came into force  on  25th  June  2013.   At  the
    hearing I asked Mr Duffy if he had any evidence that  the  applications
    were in fact made on 9th July 2013 because  the  Determination  of  the
    Judge recorded that they had been made on 2nd June 2013, and  the  copy
    application forms VAF1B contained in the file were also dated 2nd  June
    2013.  Mr Duffy was candid enough to say that he had no  such  evidence
    and believed that the date given in  the  grounds  was  erroneous.   He
    confirmed that he did not contest the substance of the Judge's decision
    allowing the appeals under paragraph 41 of HC 395.

 4. I find no error of law so that the decision of the Judge should be  set
    aside.  The only issue in this appeal is the date of  the  applications
    for entry clearance.  I am satisfied that that date is some date  prior
    to 25th June 2013 when Section 52 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013 came
    into effect.  That being the case there was no  error  of  law  in  the
    Judge deciding the appeal without any restriction as to the grounds  he
    could consider.

Decision

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I do not set aside the decision.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to Rule  45(4)(i)  of
the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005  and  I  find  no
reason to do so.
