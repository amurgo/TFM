                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


     1. This is an appeal against a determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
        Judge Cockrill promulgated on the 19th February 2013  in  which  he
        dismissed the appellant's appeal, under both the Immigration  Rules
        and on human rights (Article 8 ECHR) grounds, against  the  refusal
        to grant him indefinite leave to remain in the  United  Kingdom  on
        the basis of 14 years continuous residence.


     2. Permission to appeal was granted on a renewed  application  to  the
        Upper Tribunal on 15th May 2013.


     3. Having considered the determination, the evidence, and  submissions
        made, we find no legal error material to the  decision  to  dismiss
        the appeal has been demonstrated. We give our reasons below.



Discussion



     4. The appellant, who was born on the 1st February 1974, is a  citizen
        of Bangladesh. He claims to have entered the United Kingdom on 14th
        December 1996. As proof of this fact he relied upon a photocopy  of
        a passport issued to him on 6th June 1995 in which there  is  a  UK
        entry vignette and UK Immigration Officer's  stamp.  The  appellant
        claims the original passport has been lost.


     5. In the refusal notice  dated  28th  November  2012  the  respondent
        states that the vignette  is  counterfeit  as  is  the  Immigration
        Officer's stamp. Judge Cockrill records  in  paragraph  37  of  the
        determination that Mr Seeboruth acknowledged to  some  degree  that
        the passport had been tampered with, although alleged this  was  by
        an agent. We accept that in light of this evidence  the  Judge  was
        entitled to place little weight upon this evidence as proof of  the
        date of entry. This decision is in accordance with the evidence and
        has not been shown to be legally wrong.

     6. Mr Seeboruth then submitted  that  although  the  vignette  in  the
        passport may have been shown to be false  the  particulars  in  the
        passport itself were never challenged. There are two  responses  to
        that submission. The date of the issue of  the  passport  does  not
        indicate when the claimant first came to the  United  Kingdom.  The
        passport might have been issued for some other purposes. Second the
        fact  that the appellant relied on the entry dates in the  vignette
        rather than the true circumstances of his entry given by  reference
        to the date of the issue of the passport means that the  judge  was
        entitled to doubt his evidence, particularly where the passport was
        only a photocopy in the first place.


     7. The decision to  refuse  the  application  and  direction  for  the
        appellant's removal from the United Kingdom was made  on  the  30th
        November 2012. In AA (DP3/96 - Commencement of Enforcement  action)
        Pakistan [2007]  UKAIT  00016  the  Tribunal  held  that,  for  the
        purposes of DP3/96, service of a notice of intention to  deport  or
        service of illegal entry papers amount to decisions that 'stop  the
        clock'. Time spent in the United  Kingdom  following  such  service
        will not be counted for the purposes of applying that  Policy.   It
        was therefore only necessary for Mr Ahme to prove that he has  been
        in the United Kingdom continuously  for  at  least  fourteen  years
        before this date which will be from 29th November 1998. If evidence
        exists to prove entry and residence  since  this  date  the  issues
        relating to his alleged date of entry in 1996 and the vignette  may
        not be material.


     8. There are two pieces of relevant evidence the first being a P60 for
        the tax year 1996/1997  and  the  second  an  Abbey  National  bank
        statement. The Judge considered this evidence. In paragraph  44  he
        states no weight may be placed upon the P60 as there is no reliable
        evidence from anyone associated with the alleged employer to  prove
        the reliability of that document. We accept there are  two  letters
        in the bundle one from a  Mr  S  Uddin  of  the  Passage  of  India
        restaurant dated  4th  February  1997  confirming  the  appellant's
        employment and a weekly wage of ï¿½60.00 paid  in  cash  and  another
        from Belson and Sons signed by a Mr S Belson and  dated  18th  July
        2008 stating the author of that letter has known Mr Ahme since  May
        1998 from the restaurant. The letter states the appellant has  been
        continuously in the United Kingdom but fails to state the basis  on
        which this assertion is made.


     9. In addition to the finding in relation to the  falsified  documents
        Judge Cockrill stated in paragraph 43 of the determination :


              "I have to say that I also found the Appellant  an  unreliable
   witness  and              that  lack  of  credibility   and   reliability
   permeated his whole evidence"


    10. The fact Judge Cockrill was cautious in relation to the evidence is
        understandable in light of the falsified document. Such an approach
        in this case does not  disclose  any  legal  error.  There  was  no
        attendance by the authors of any  documents  or  indeed  any  other
        relevant supporting oral evidence, a fact  commented  upon  by  the
        Judge. A P60 is  not  a  document  issued  by  HMRC  confirming  an
        individual's employment status and earnings but a  form  ordinarily
        completed by an employer (End of Year Certificate)  and  issued  to
        taxpayers at the end of a tax year. The ability  to  produce  other
        falsified documents and the absence of corroborative evidence  from
        a reliable source in relation to  his  alleged  employment  at  the
        relevant time  justified  little  weight  being  attached  to  this
        evidence. The findings in  relation  to  the  Abbey  National  bank
        statement, which the appellant claimed in his oral evidence not  to
        have opened, are also sustainable.


    11. It is settled jurisprudence that  weight  is  matter  for  a  judge
        provided it is shown that the evidence has been considered with the
        degree of care required  by  the  case  in  question  and  adequate
        reasons have been given for the findings made. In  this  appeal  we
        are satisfied this is what Judge Cockrill did as a result of  which
        he concluded that the appellant had not discharged  the  burden  of
        proof upon him to the required standard to prove  he  was  able  to
        satisfy the relevant immigration rule. This is a  finding  that  is
        within the range of findings the Judge was entitled  to  make  when
        considering the evidence as a whole and  we  find  no  legal  error
        proved.


    12. We also find no legal error in the Judge not making  a  finding  in
        relation to the actual date of  entry,  as  the  evidence  did  not
        permit such a finding to be made.


    13. Mr Seeboruth also sought to challenge the dismissal of  the  appeal
        on Article 8 grounds. He accepted the case relates to private  life
        recognised by Article 8 ECHR only. He submitted that  although  the
        actual date of entry could not be identified the appellant had been
        in the United Kingdom for a long time, over ten years.


    14. It is  not  disputed  that  the  appellant  has  been  here  for  a
        considerable period of time but that is not the  issue.  The  Judge
        noted the nature of his private life  was  limited  [53]  and  that
        claims made in relation to the same were not  supported  by  cogent
        evidence. It is not just the period of time which is  the  relevant
        factor but the nature of the ties established in the country during
        this period that form the basis of an  individual's  private  life.
        The reference to the ten year lawful residence rule and  submission
        that  this  should  have  persuaded  the  Judge  to  find  in   the
        appellant's favour has no merit. The ten year rule applied to those
        with lawful residence which this appellant does not have. He  never
        achieved fourteen years residence that would have been the relevant
        period at the material time. The nature of  the  private  life  was
        limited and the weight to be given to such private life established
        when the appellant had no leave to remain  was  also  limited.  The
        finding  that  any  interference  with   his   private   life   was
        proportionate in all the  circumstances  is  within  the  range  of
        findings the Judge was entitled  to  make  on  the  evidence.  This
        ground is, in effect, a disagreement with the outcome of a properly
        conducted balancing exercise and no more. No legal error is proved.




Decision

    15. There is no material error of law in the Immigration Judge's
        decision. The determination shall stand.
