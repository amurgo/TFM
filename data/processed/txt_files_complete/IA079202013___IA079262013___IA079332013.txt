                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The Appellants are Shamsuddin Mithani, his wife  Shabana  Mithani,  and
    their son Ziyaan Mithani.  They are all citizens of India.   They  were
    born respectively on 25th December 1975, 9th March 1975, and  21st  May
    2003.  The main Appellant, Shamsuddin Mithani, was first granted  leave
    to enter the UK as a student on 28th January 2008.  He was then granted
    successive periods of leave to remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student and
    as a Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) Migrant until 2nd  September  2012.   The
    remaining Appellants were granted leave to enter and to remain  as  his
    dependants.  On 30th  August  2012,  the  main  Appellant  applied  for
    further leave to remain as a Tier 1  (Entrepreneur)  Migrant  with  the
    other Appellants as his dependants.  Those  applications  were  refused
    for the reasons given in a Notice of Decision dated 26th February 2013.
     The Appellants appealed, and their appeals were  heard  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Morris (the Judge) sitting at Hatton Cross on 24th  June
    2013.  She decided to allow the appeals under the Immigration Rules for
    the reasons given in her Determination promulgated on 16th  July  2013.
    The Respondent sought leave to appeal that decision, and on  31st  July
    2013 such permission was granted.

Error of Law

 2. I must first decide if the decision of the Judge contained an error  on
    a point of law so that it should be set aside.

 3. The issue before the Judge was whether the Appellant scored  sufficient
    points for Attributes under Appendix A of  HC  395.   The  Respondent's
    case was that although the main Appellant had access  to  funds  of  at
    least ï¿½50,000, he did not meet the requirements of sub-paragraphs (iii)
    and (iv) of Table 4 of Appendix A.  No documents had been submitted  to
    show that the main Appellant had registered with HMRC as self-employed,
    nor had he submitted the specified evidence set out in paragraph  41-SD
    to show that he was engaged in business activity.

 4. The Judge allowed the appeal because  she  found  that  the  Respondent
    should  have  requested  further  documentation  from  the   Appellants
    pursuant  to  paragraph  245AA(b)  of  HC  395.    Alternatively,   the
    Respondent should have sought and considered  further  documents  under
    her Evidential Flexibility Policy.  Further, the Judge found  that  the
    main  Appellant  was  engaged  in  business  activity  from   documents
    contained in the Appellants' bundle amounting to contracts which  post-
    dated the date of decision.

 5. Ms Everett argued at the hearing and in the grounds that the Judge  had
    erred in law in reaching her conclusion.  The  Judge  had  relied  upon
    evidence which she was not entitled to consider under the provisions of
    Section 85A Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  Further, the
    Judge had erred in law by allowing the  appeal  under  the  Immigration
    Rules on the basis that the Respondent had not applied  her  Evidential
    Flexibility Policy.  The decision of the Judge should  have  been  that
    the Respondent's decision was not in accordance with the law.

 6. In response, Mr Malik accepted that the finding  of  the  Judge  should
    have been that the Respondent's decision was not in accordance with the
    law.  However, he argued that the  Judge  was  entitled  to  take  into
    account  post-decision  evidence  under  the  provisions   of   Section
    85A(4)(c) of the 2002 Act.  This provides that  post-decision  evidence
    can be adduced to prove that a document is genuine or valid, using  the
    Oxford English Dictionary definition of valid as "legally acceptable".

 7. I do find an error of law in the decision  of  the  Judge  so  that  it
    should be set aside.   It  is  clear  from  paragraph  16(iii)  of  the
    Determination that the
    Judge relied upon documentation contained  in  the  Appellants'  bundle
    which post-dated the date of decision to decide that the main Appellant
    was engaged in business activity which is an essential  requirement  of
    Table 4 for the purpose of establishing that the main Appellant  scored
    25 points under Appendix A:  Attributes.   I  do  not  agree  with  the
    submission  of  Mr  Malik  that  the  exception  contained  in  Section
    85A(4)(c) can be applied in this case.  The documents in  question  are
    business contracts and were not produced to establish  the  genuineness
    or validity of another document.

 8. I also find that the Judge erred in law in applying the  provisions  of
    paragraph 245AA(b) of HC 395.   It  cannot  be  said  that  the  single
    invoice  produced  by  the  Appellant  was  a  sequence  of  documents.
    Finally, if the Judge was correct in finding that  the  Respondent  had
    failed to apply her own Evidential Flexibility Policy, the Judge  erred
    in law in allowing the appeal under the Immigration Rules  whereas  she
    should have found that the Respondent's decision was not in  accordance
    with the law.

 9. I therefore set aside the decision of the Judge.  I decided  to  remake
    that decision on the basis of the evidence before the Judge.

Re-Made Decision

10.  I heard further submissions from the representatives.  Ms Everett  was
    content only to say that she relied upon the contents of the Notice  of
    Decision.  She argued that the Evidential  Flexibility  Policy  had  no
    application in a case such as this as it was not the responsibility  of
    the  Secretary  of  State  to  correct  omissions  in  the  Appellant's
    documentation.

11. In response, Mr Malik asked me to make a finding that the  decision  of
    the Respondent was not in accordance with the  law  as  the  Evidential
    Flexibility Policy had not been applied.  Alternatively, he pointed out
    that the Judge had made no decision  upon  the  Appellant's  Article  8
    rights and therefore the appeal should be remitted  to  the  Judge  for
    such a finding.

12. I dismiss the appeal under the Immigration Rules.

13. Excluding post-decision evidence, I find that the main Appellant failed
    to submit with his application documents sufficient to show that he was
    registered with HMRC as  self-employed  and  that  he  was  engaged  in
    business activity.  The documents which were submitted are referred  to
    in the Notice of Decision and they are clearly insufficient.   Further,
    I find that the provisions of paragraph  245AA(b)  of  HC  395  has  no
    application  to  documents  of  this  nature  and  therefore  that  the
    Appellants cannot rely upon this provision.  Likewise, I find that  the
    Evidential Flexibility Policy has no application  to  a  case  such  as
    this.  The Appellant had provided  few of the specified  documents  and
    the Policy does not operate so  as  to  impose  an  obligation  on  the
    Respondent to provide further opportunity to do so.

14. Finally, there is no provision for me to remit the appeal to the  Judge
    for consideration of the Appellant's Article 8  rights.   There  is  no
    evidence before me of any family or private life of the  Appellants  in
    the UK and therefore I find that such rights are  not  engaged  by  the
    Respondent's decision.  All the parties to this  appeal  were  given  a
    Direction to the effect that they should prepare for the hearing on the
    basis  that,  if  the  Upper  Tribunal  decided  to   set   aside   the
    Determination  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  any  further   evidence,
    including supplementary oral evidence, that the  Upper  Tribunal  might
    need to consider if it decided to remake  the  decision,  could  be  so
    considered at the hearing.

Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I set aside the decision.

I remake the decision in the appeal by dismissing it under  the  Immigration
Rules and on human rights grounds.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to Rule  45(4)(i)  of
the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure)  Rules  2005.   I  have  not
been asked to vary that order and do not do so.
