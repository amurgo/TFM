Representation:

For the Appellants:    Ms Townshend of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr G Saunders, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1) This is an appeal with permission against a  decision  by  Judge  of  the
   First-tier Tribunal Whalan dismissing these appeals against  refusals  of
   further leave to remain.  The appellants are a family from Mongolia.  The
   first appellant applied for leave to remain as a  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)
   Migrant under the Points Based System and the second and third appellants
   applied as her dependants.

Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

2) The issue before the First-tier Tribunal was whether the first  appellant
   was entitled to the 75 points claimed under Appendix A of the Immigration
   Rules.  It was argued by the respondent that she  had  failed  to  submit
   advertising or marketing material and any contracts showing trading  with
   her application to vary leave to remain.  These documents  were  required
   under paragraph 41-SD(c)(iii) and (iv) of Appendix A.

3) The Judge of the First-tier Tribunal recorded that  the  first  appellant
   and her husband, the second appellant, had decided  to  form  a  business
   marketing Mongolian cashmere products in the UK.  They planned to  design
   clothes in the UK and have them made up from cashmere in Mongolia.   They
   would then be shipped to the UK for sale in the  UK  and  other  European
   countries.  In June 2012 they were in negotiations  with  a  supplier  in
   Mongolia,  whose  business  name  was  Special  International  LLC.   The
   negotiations with this supplier were completed on 19 January  2013,  only
   two  days  before  the  appellant's  existing   leave   expired.    Their
   applications for further leave to remain were  submitted  on  21  January
   2013.   The  judge  observed  that  the  respondent  accepted  that   the
   appellants satisfied all the relevant requirements of Appendix  A  except
   in respect of providing evidence of advertising or marketing material and
   one or more contracts showing trading.  It was accepted,  in  particular,
   that the first appellant had available funds exceeding �50,000.

4) At the  hearing  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  the  first  appellant
   produced copies of  advertising  materials  dating  from  December  2012.
   However, according to  the  judge  no  contracts  were  produced  showing
   trading by the company set up by the first and second  appellants,  which
   was called Enzo MGL Ltd.  This company was not incorporated until  around
   18 January 2013, only a few days before the applications were lodged.

5) Before the First-tier Tribunal the appellants  relied  on  the  cases  of
   Raju [2013] EWCA Civ 754 and Rodriguez (Flexibility Policy)  [2013]  UKUT
   00042.  It was argued that the respondent failed to follow her evidential
   flexibility  policy,  or  otherwise  to  exercise   the   discretion   of
   appropriate  evidential  flexibility,  insofar  as  when  the  respondent
   realised that not all the required documents  had  been  filed  with  the
   application, the  first  appellant  should  have  been  given  a  further
   opportunity to provide them.

6) The judge accepted this argument insofar as the advertising or  marketing
   material was concerned.  The judge noted that material of this nature had
   been prepared by the appellants in December 2012 but  mistakenly  omitted
   from the material submitted with the application.  This was the result of
   the haste with which the application was assembled and  filed  after  the
   incorporation of Enzo MGL Ltd.  The judge found, however, that there were
   no contracts showing trading available at the time  the  application  was
   made.  This was because  the  company  had  been  formed  only  two  days
   previously, and the judge further  found  that  no  such  contracts  were
   available at the date of the decision appealed against of 25 March  2013.
   According to the judge there was  no  contract  showing  trading  in  the
   documentary  evidence.   The  first   appellant   therefore   could   not
   demonstrate compliance with this particular requirement of paragraph  41-
   SD of Appendix A.  This  was  regrettable  as  she  satisfied  the  other
   requirements but the  Points  Based  Scheme  required  strict,  technical
   adherence.   Accordingly  the   judge   concluded   that   the   relevant
   requirements were not satisfied and the appeals were dismissed.

Application for permission to appeal

7) In the application for permission to appeal it was submitted  that  there
   was a contract which would have satisfied the relevant requirement.  This
   was a letter of  intent  dated  19  January  2013  signed  by  the  first
   appellant and by a representative on behalf of Special International LLC.
    This letter of intent was referred to by the first appellant in her oral
   testimony before the First-tier Tribunal.  It was not, however, mentioned
   in the determination.  The judge's failure to refer to this was a failure
   to consider relevant evidence.

8) It was further submitted in the  application  for  permission  to  appeal
   that the respondent's evidential  flexibility  policy  should  have  been
   applied to the letter of intent as it was applied to the  advertising  or
   marketing materials and the letter of intent should therefore  have  been
   taken into account by the judge.  The letter of intent  was  provided  in
   its original form at the hearing.  The failures by the  judge  created  a
   near certainty that significant issues were not properly addressed.

9) Permission to  appeal  was  granted  on  the  basis  that  there  was  no
   reference in the determination to  the  letter  of  intent,  which  might
   qualify as the requisite contract,  and  to  this  extent  there  was  an
   arguable error of law.

Submissions

10) At the hearing before us Ms Townshend referred to  a  skeleton  argument
   for the appellants.  She submitted that there were  two  grounds  in  the
   skeleton argument which she would be pursuing.  The first  of  these  was
   the failure to consider the  letter  of  intent  as  a  contract  showing
   trading.  The second was the failure to consider the appellants'  Article
   8 rights.  The letter of intent was clearly provided in  the  appellant's
   bundle at page 250.  The judge was mistaken to say that no  contract  was
   available.

11) Ms Townshend acknowledged that the letter of intent and the  advertising
   material  was  not  submitted  with  the   original   application.    The
   advertising material was, however, taken into account by the judge  under
   the evidential flexibility policy.   If  the  judge  had  had  taken  the
   contract into consideration then it would also have  benefited  from  the
   evidential flexibility policy.

12) Ms Townshend then referred  to  a  witness  statement,  at  B28  of  the
   appellant's bundle, lodged for the purpose of the  appeal  to  the  Upper
   Tribunal.  This witness statement was by Florence Iveson, who was Counsel
   for the appellants before the First-tier Tribunal.  Ms  Townshend  sought
   to rely on the witness statement as showing that at  the  hearing  before
   the First-tier Tribunal the respondent had conceded that  documents  were
   available to satisfy the relevant requirements but erroneously  were  not
   submitted with the application.  All the appellants' documentary evidence
   was accepted and there was no cross-examination in respect  of  it.   The
   only issue was the issue of evidential flexibility.   The  judge  applied
   the policy of evidential flexibility to the advertising material but  not
   to the contract.

13) Ms Townshend pointed  out  that  Ms  Iveson's  statement  also  included
   submissions she had made in relation to Article 8.  It was pointed out to
   Ms Townshend that no issue arising from  Article  8  was  raised  in  the
   application for permission to appeal.  Ms Townshend replied that  Article
   8 was referred to in her skeleton argument.  The judge did  not  consider
   the issues under Article 8 even though Article 8 was relied upon  in  the
   original grounds of appeal and argued in submissions before the judge.

14) Ms Townshend continued that there was  no  argument  that  the  relevant
   documents were not available.  The only argument  related  to  evidential
   flexibility.  Had the judge considered the contract then  he  would  have
   applied the same reasoning to it as to  the  advertising  material.   The
   judge, however, disregarded the letter of 19 January  2013  from  Special
   International LLC.

15) Ms Townshend then sought to address us on issues in relation to  Article
   8.  Mr Saunders said he had not had proper notice of any  argument  under
   Article 8 because it was not included in the application  for  permission
   to appeal.  The only notice was at paragraph 37 of the skeleton argument.
    Ms Townshend pointed out that this had been  sent  14  days  previously.
   She further submitted that as a public body, the Tribunal had a  duty  to
   consider human rights issues.

16) We decided to listen to the submissions which Ms Townshend  was  seeking
   to make in respect of Article 8  and  to  reserve  our  determination  on
   whether we would allow the application for permission  to  appeal  to  be
   varied to include such arguments.  It was pointed  out  to  Ms  Townshend
   that if she was relying on a "near miss" argument, then the Supreme Court
   was due to pronounce on this issue shortly.  The view  of  the  Court  of
   Appeal was that a "near miss" argument by itself was insufficient for  an
   appeal to succeed under Article 8.

17) Ms Townshend submitted that the extent to which the first appellant  had
   been able to comply with the requirements of the Immigration Rules was  a
   matter which ought to be taken into account in  the  balancing  exercise.
   Both the documents omitted from the application were  available  and  the
   appellants had  simply  forgotten  to  submit  them.   This  was  a  very
   unfortunate mistake.   The appellants have been in the UK for seven years
   and their child was born here.  The second appellant worked as a  manager
   for Royal Mail and had completed  a  Master's  degree  in  the  UK.   The
   appellants were taking steps to set up a business.  This all  had  to  be
   weighed with the mistake of failing to  include  one  document  with  the
   application.   The  appellants  had  been  found  before  the  First-tier
   Tribunal to be clear and credible  witnesses.   Their  evidence  was  not
   challenged.  It was disproportionate not to allow the appeal on the basis
   of one document having been omitted from the application.

18) Ms Townshend referred to a Rule  24  notice  lodged  by  the  respondent
   questioning whether the letter of intent  amounted  to  a  contract.   Ms
   Townshend submitted that  the  letter  of  intent  was  a  contract.   It
   included the names of the business and the other party and  was  for  the
   supply of cashmere products.  There was no evidence before the First-tier
   Tribunal to show that this was not a contract and it had been put to  the
   first appellant that it was a  contract  when  she  was  giving  evidence
   before the First-tier  Tribunal.   This  was  confirmed  by  the  witness
   statement by Florence Iveson.

19) For the respondent Mr Saunders said that he  had  no  objection  to  the
   Tribunal having regard to this witness statement but he did not regard it
   as a complete  record.   The  Presenting  Officer  who  appeared  at  the
   previous hearing had made no record of any concession to the effect  that
   the  letter  of  intent  was  a  contract.   At  this  juncture  a  brief
   examination of the record of proceedings  from  the  hearing  before  the
   First-tier Tribunal showed no  apparent  concession  in  respect  of  the
   letter of intent.

20) We invited Mr Saunders to continue his submission.   He  contended  that
   the letter of intent was not a contract but an intention to enter into  a
   contract.  The Rules specifically required the submission of one or  more
   contracts showing trading.  In relation  to  the  evidential  flexibility
   policy, the judge made it clear that in his view there was a  distinction
   between the advertising material and the letter of intent.  The letter of
   intent would not be an evident omission, such as a missing document in  a
   sequence of bank statements.  There was no indication of any intention to
   send the missing documents with the application.

21) It was put to Mr Saunders that the evidential flexibility policy at  the
   relevant dated was expressed in paragraph 245AA of the Immigration Rules.
    Mr Saunders was not in a position to confirm this but he submitted  that
   the relevant documents must be sent with the  application  in  accordance
   with paragraph 41-SD of Appendix A.

22) In relation to Article 8, Mr Saunders submitted that the evidence as  to
   private and family life was already known.  The  first  appellant  was  a
   student and now sought to remain as a post-study migrant.   It  might  be
   argued that this was a "near miss" where the  first  appellant  had  only
   failed in respect of certain technical requirements  of  the  Immigration
   Rules.  In this area of the Rules, however, all the requirements could be
   categorised as technical requirements.

23) It was  pointed  out  to  Mr  Saunders  that  the  respondent's  refusal
   decision of 26 March 2013 contained a removal decision under  section  47
   of the 2006 Act.  Mr Saunders was asked whether this  decision  had  been
   withdrawn as it was not in accordance with the law.  Mr Saunders  replied
   that it did not appear to have been withdrawn but he acknowledged that it
   was unlawful.

24)  In  response  to  Mr  Saunders,  Ms  Townshend   submitted   that   the
   requirements of the Immigration Rules had clearly been met.   The  letter
   of intent was an offer to supply cashmere and it was accepted.  There was
   consideration of �40,000.  It was an agreement between two parties.   The
   purpose of the relevant Immigration Rules was to enable people  to  start
   up a business from the beginning.  Ms Townshend  said  there  was  now  a
   further contract which she sought to rely on.

25) Ms Townshend was reminded  that  our  function  at  this  stage  was  to
   identify whether there was an error of law in the decision of the  First-
   tier Tribunal.  Ms Townshend submitted that there was such  an  error  in
   the application of the evidential flexibility policy.   She  referred  to
   the letter of 19 May 2011 from Mr Oppenheim of UKBA, attached as Appendix
   A to the case of Rodriguez.  This was a case of human  error  which  came
   within the  terms  of  the  letter  from  Mr  Oppenheim.    There  was  a
   legitimate expectation  that  the  first  appellant  would  be  given  an
   opportunity to remedy this error.

26) Ms Townshend further submitted that in relation to Article 8  the  first
   appellant was seeking to establish a bona fide business and this had  not
   been challenged.  She had the required funds and she met  the  Rules  and
   all requirements.  She had been in  the  UK  lawfully  since  2006.   The
   purpose of  the  Rules  in  relation  to  entrepreneur  migrants  was  to
   encourage people like the appellant.

Discussion

27) The first issue we have to consider is whether the Judge of  the  First-
   tier Tribunal made an error of law by failing to refer to the  letter  of
   intent of 19 January 2013.  We note that the finding  by  the  judge  was
   that there were no contracts showing trading, either at the date when the
   application was submitted or at the date of decision.  At paragraph 21 of
   the determination the judge made express reference to documents  referred
   to at paragraph 23 of the first appellant's witness statement  and  found
   that these did not include any contract showing trading.   We  note  that
   the letter of intent was specifically referred to at paragraph 23 of  the
   witness statement as outlining the terms of the proposed  business.   The
   Judge of the First-tier Tribunal clearly had regard to this and  did  not
   accept that the letter of intent was a contract  showing  trading.   This
   was a finding which the judge was entitled to make and in  so  doing  the
   judge did not make an error of law.  The application  for  permission  to
   appeal was drafted on the basis that the judge had failed to have  regard
   to the letter of intent but  the  specific  reference  by  the  judge  to
   paragraph 23 of the first appellant's witness statement, where the letter
   of intent is referred to, together with the judge's  finding  as  to  the
   absence of any contracts showing trading, satisfies us that the judge did
   not fail to have regard to the letter of intent.

28) We know turn to the judge's application of  the  evidential  flexibility
   policy.  In this regard the appellant sought to rely  on  Mr  Oppenheim's
   letter of 19 May 2011.  The letter referred  to  "...a  validation  stage
   being trialled whereby applicants are contacted where mandatory  evidence
   is missing and given the opportunity to provide it..."   The  policy  set
   out in Mr Oppenheim's letter, however, has been subject to  change.   The
   decision appealed against was made on 25 March 2013 and it  is  necessary
   in considering whether the evidential flexibility policy was followed  to
   look at the policy at this time.  At the hearing we asked the parties  to
   identify the terms of the evidential flexibility policy as it existed  at
   the time of the refusal decision.   Neither  party  was  wholly  able  to
   assist us.   It  is  our  understanding,  however,  that  the  evidential
   flexibility policy at the relevant time was expressed in paragraph  245AA
   of the Immigration Rules.  This was a point which was made to the parties
   at the hearing.  This provision is expressed in the following terms:

   "245AA Documents not submitted with applications


           a) Where Part 6A or any appendices referred to in Part 6A  state
              that specified documents must  be  provided,  the  UK  Border
              Agency will only consider documents that have been  submitted
              with  the  application,  and  will  only  consider  documents
              submitted  after  the  application  where  sub-paragraph  (b)
              applies.
           b) The sub-paragraph applies if the applicant has submitted:
               i) a sequence of documents and some of the documents in  the
                  sequence have been  omitted  (for  example  if  one  bank
                  statement from a series is missing);
              ii) a document in the wrong format; or
             iii) a document that is a copy and not an  original  document,
                  the UK Border Agency will contact the  applicant  or  his
                  representative  in  writing,  and  request  the   correct
                  documents.  The requested documents must be  received  by
                  the UK Border Agency at  the  address  specified  in  the
                  request within  7  workings  days  of  the  date  of  the
                  request.
           c) The UK Border Agency  will  not  request  documents  where  a
              specified document has not been  submitted  (for  example  an
              English language certificate is missing), or whether  the  UK
              Border  Agency  does  not  anticipate  that  addressing   the
              omission or error referred to in sub-paragraph (b) will  lead
              to a grant because the application will be refused for  other
              reasons."


29) The Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  decided  that  the  advertising
   material  which  was  omitted  from  the  application  fell  within   the
   evidential flexibility policy.  In our view, if there was an error of law
   made by the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal, it was to accept  that  the
   advertising material fell within the terms of the policy, as set  out  in
   paragraph 245AA.  The advertising material was not part of a sequence, or
   a document in the wrong format, or a document that was a copy and not  an
   original.  It  was  indeed  a  specified  document  which  had  not  been
   submitted, and therefore  fell  within  sub-paragraph  (c)  of  paragraph
   245AA, in terms of which there was no requirement on  the  respondent  to
   request such a document.  However, as the appeal was dismissed, the error
   made by the judge in this regard did not affect  the  outcome  under  the
   Immigration Rules.

30) Before us Ms  Townshend  sought  to  argue  that  the  judge  failed  to
   consider the appeal under Article 8.  It was pointed out to her that this
   was not part of the application for permission to  appeal  to  the  Upper
   Tribunal.  She nevertheless responded that we had a duty to consider this
   argument.  We would, of course, accept that under section 6 of the  Human
   Rights Act 1998, a Tribunal must not act in a way which  is  incompatible
   with a Convention right.

31) The difficulty for the appellants, however, in relying on Article 8,  is
   in showing disproportionate interference with their Article 8  rights  by
   the refusal decision.  The case under Article 8 set out at  paragraph  37
   of the skeleton argument for the appellants is that the  first  appellant
   has been in the UK for seven years and has a young child who was born  in
   the UK.  Her husband has worked in the UK for the entirety of  his  stay.
   The first appellant's qualifications were gained in  the  UK  and  it  is
   asserted that these would be most helpful to her  in  the  UK.   She  has
   invested time and money in educating herself in the UK and in setting  up
   her own business.  If it were not accepted that  she  complied  with  the
   Rules at the time of her application, given her ability  to  comply  with
   the Rules now, it would  be  a  disproportionate  interference  with  her
   private and family life to prevent her from setting up a business in  the
   UK due to the  inflexibility  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   It  is  then
   submitted at paragraph 38 that  immigration  policy  was  presumably  not
   intended to prevent entrepreneurs from investing money and setting  up  a
   business in the UK.

32) As has been pointed out in a  number  of  authorities,  it  is  not  the
   purpose of Article 8 to permit appellants to circumvent the  requirements
   of the Immigration Rules.  We note that very shortly after the hearing of
   this appeal, the Supreme Court issued the anticipated judgment  in  Patel
   [2013] UKSC  72  addressing  the  "near-miss"  argument.   Lord  Carnwath
   expressed support for the approach of the Court of Appeal in Miah  [2013]
   QB 35 to the "near-miss" argument but pointed out that  "the  context  of
   the rules may be relevant to  consideration  of  proportionality..."   He
   added that "a near-miss under the rules cannot  provide  substance  to  a
   human rights case which is  otherwise  lacking  in  merit."   He  further
   stated, at paragraph 57: "It is important to remember that article  8  is
   not a general dispensing power."  For our part we see nothing which would
   have entitled the appellants to succeed under Article 8  where  they  did
   not meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules.  As the Judge of  the
   First-tier Tribunal observed, it is regrettable that what appears to be a
   viable business proposal should not meet the requirements  of  the  Rules
   but that is the position in these appeals and the judge made no error  by
   not relying upon Article 8 to circumvent the requirements of the Rules.

Conclusions

33) The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  did  not  involve
   the making of an error on a point of law.

34) We do not set aside the decision.

Anonymity

35) The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction  and  we  do
   not consider there is a need for an order to this effect.
