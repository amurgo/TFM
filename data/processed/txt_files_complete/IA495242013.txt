                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. I have considered whether any parties  require  the  protection  of  an
    anonymity direction. No anonymity  direction  was  made  previously  in
    respect of this Appellant. Having considered all the circumstances  and
    evidence I do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.

 2. The Secretary of State for the Home Department brought an appeal but in
    order to avoid confusion the parties are referred to as  they  were  in
    the First-tier Tribunal. This was an appeal by the Secretary  of  State
    against a decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Thorne  promulgated  on
    28 July 2014 which allowed the Appellant's appeal under the Immigration
    (EEA) Regulations 2006 (the EEA Regulations) as he  accepted  that  the
    Appellant and her EEA sponsor were validly married under  both  Spanish
    and Ghanaian law.

 3. On 12 December I heard an appeal against  that  decision  and  found  a
    material error of law and set the decision  aside  on  teh  basis  that
    while the Judge had evidence before him that the marriage of a  Spanish
    national was valid anywhere in the world  if  the  marriage  was  valid
    under local law he failed to consider the second  requirement  for  the
    marriage being valid under Spanish law which was that the marriage  was
    registered with the Spanish authorities in the consular section of  the
    local Spanish Embassy.

 4. The case was adjourned for re hearing before me  as  to  the  issue  of
    whether the marriage had been registered and in the alternative whether
    the parties  were  in  a  durable  relationship  for  the  purposes  of
    Regulation 8(5) of the EEA regulations.

 5. The Appellant was not represented at the  hearing  her  previous  legal
    representatives no longer acting for her. She confirmed  that  she  was
    content to proceed without them. I explained the purpose of the hearing
    to her and confirmed that she understood.

Legal Framework

 6. The Appellant applied for admission to the United Kingdom by virtue  of
    European Community Law as the spouse by virtue of a proxy marriage of a
    European Economic Area national namely Joseph Mensah Quansah  a Spanish
     national who is exercising rights of free movement under the treaty of
    Rome in the United Kingdom.

 7. Regulation 17 of the Regulations sets out the procedure for  the  issue
    of a EEA Residence Card:

         "17.     (1) The Secretary of State must issue a residence card  to
             a person who is not an EEA national and is the  family  member
             of a qualified person or of an EEA national with  a  permanent
             right of residence under  regulation  15  on  application  and
             production of -

                  (a)  a valid passport; and

                  (b)  proof that the applicant is such a family member."




 8. Regulation 7 sets out which family members are considered to be  family
    members of an EEA national and therefore entitled to apply for a family
    permit. The definition includes the spouse of an  EEA  national  except
    where the marriage is a marriage of convenience.

 9. Regulation 17(4) of 2006 EEA Regulations  provides  discretion  to  the
    Secretary of State to issue a residence card  to  an  'extended  family
    member'.   The definition of such a person is found in Regulation 8(5):

         "(5) A person satisfies the condition  in  this  paragraph  if  the
         person is the partner of  an  EEA  national  (other  than  a  civil
         partner) and can prove to the  decision  maker  that  he  is  in  a
         durable relationship with the EEA national."

10.  "Durable relationship" is not defined in the Regulations, and  whether
    a person is in a durable relationship is a matter to be determined on a
    case-by-case basis although guidance is given in the European  Casework
    instructions to include evidence  that  the  parties  have  been  in  a
    relationship akin to marriage for 2 years.

11. The burden of proving that  any  of  the  documents  submitted  by  the
    Appellant in support of the application are not genuine  rests  on  the
    Respondent. Otherwise, "the onus of proving either a customary marriage
    or dissolution rests on the party making the assertion"  (NA)  and  the
    standard of proof is upon the balance of probability.

12. In relation to the relevant date I have considered Boodhoo and  another
    (EEA Regs: relevant evidence) [2013] UKUT 00346 (IAC) where it was held
    that in an EEA appeal, a tribunal has power to  consider  any  evidence
    which it thinks relevant to the substance of  the  decision,  including
    evidence which  concerns  a  matter  arising  after  the  date  of  the
    decision.

13. In relation to proxy marriages generally I have taken into account  the
    most recent authority Kareem (Proxy marriages -  EU  law)  [2014]  UKUT
    24(IAC) where it was held that

          i) A person who is the  spouse  of  an  EEA  national  who  is  a
             qualified person in the United Kingdom can  derive  rights  of
             free  movement  and  residence  if  proof   of   the   marital
             relationship is provided;

         ii) The production of a marriage certificate issued by a competent
             authority (that is, issued according to the registration  laws
             of the country where the marriage took place) will usually  be
             sufficient. If  not  in  English  (or  Welsh  in  relation  to
             proceedings in Wales), a certified translation of the marriage
             certificate will be required;

        iii) A document which calls itself a marriage certificate will  not
             raise a presumption of the  marriage  it  purports  to  record
             unless it has been issued by an authority with legal power  to
             create or confirm the facts it attests:

         iv) In appeals where there is  no  such  marriage  certificate  or
             where there is doubt that  a  marriage  certificate  has  been
             issued by a competent authority, then the marital relationship
             may be  proved  by  other  evidence.  This  will  require  the
             Tribunal to determine whether a marriage was contracted;

          v) In such an appeal,  the  starting  point  will  be  to  decide
             whether a marriage was contracted between  the  appellant  and
             the qualified person according to the national law of the  EEA
             country of the qualified person's nationality;

         vi) In all such  situations,  when  resolving  issues  that  arise
             because of conflicts of law, proper respect must be  given  to
             the qualified person's rights  as  provided  by  the  European
             Treaties, including the right to marry and the rights of  free
             movement and residence;

        vii) It should be assumed that, without  independent  and  reliable
             evidence about the recognition of the marriage under the  laws
             of the EEA country and/or the country where the marriage  took
             place, the Tribunal is  likely  to  be  unable  to  find  that
             sufficient evidence has been provided to discharge the  burden
             of proof. Mere production of  legal  materials  from  the  EEA
             country or country where  the  marriage  took  place  will  be
             insufficient evidence because they will rarely show  how  such
             law  is  understood  or  applied  in  those  countries.   Mere
             assertions as to the effect of such  laws  will,  for  similar
             reasons, carry no weight;

       viii) These remarks apply solely to the question of whether a person
             is a spouse for the purposes of EU law. It does not relate  to
             other relationships that  might  be  regarded  as  similar  to
             marriage, such as civil partnerships or durable relationships.

14. I have also taken into account TA and Others (Kareem  explained)  Ghana
    [2014] UKUT 00316 (IAC) where the Upper Tribunal found  that  following
    the decision in Kareem, the determination of whether there is a marital
    relationship for the purposes of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006
    must always be examined in accordance with the laws of the Member State
    from which the Union citizen obtains nationality.

Evidence

15.  I had before me the original bundle of documents that were before  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

16. The Appellant produced a letter dated 6  February  2015  in  which  she
    stated that after the last hearing

         'her husband gave the documents to his brother in  Accra  who  took
         them to the Spanish Embassy for legalisation and I humbly draw  the
         Judge's attention to the stamp in Spanish  language  that  has  now
         been translated into English Language.'

17. Ms Ampofo gave oral evidence adopting the contents of that letter.

18. She confirmed that her and her husband had  moved  to  the  address  32
    Relstone Avenue Oldham 6 months ago. They attended the local Church  St
    Andrews where the vicar was Nick Andrews.

19. She stated that her husband worked for Emprice Cleaning Services and he
    was full time earning about �700 per month.

20. She said that they had first met in about 2012 at a friend's  party  in
    London.

21. In cross examination she explained that her husband  had  attended  the
    court on a number of previous occasions but could not attend  today  as
    he feared being sacked.

22. She was unable to explain why there  was  no  deposit  in  her  husband
    account that equated to the figure she had given for his earnings.

23. She confirmed that there were  no  documents  in  her  name  for  their
    address and said that was because she was not working so no  one  wrote
    to her there apart from the solicitor. She had not though to bring  the
    council tax demand or indeed a statement from her husband although  the
    letter she produced from her solicitor to show her address stated  that
    she needed a statement from her husband.

24. The letter from the vicar referred to her having a son called  Emmanuel
    whose father was a Macklin Pipra in Ghana.  She confirmed that Emmanuel
    was referred to in a different name and date of birth in her visit visa
    application of 2004. She stated that the child's father had changed her
    sons name a date of birth because he married someone else.

Final Submissions

25.  On  behalf  of  the  Respondent  Ms  Johnstone  made   the   following
    submissions:

      a) The Appellant had not met the  evidential  burden  of  establishing
         that her proxy marriage was valid under Spanish law as she had  not
         provided evidence that  it  had  been  registered  at  the  Spanish
         consulate in Accra they had merely authenticated the  documents  in
         relation to the marriage.

      b) In relation to the durability of the relationship no  evidence  had
         been produced in relation to the them living  together  apart  from
         one bank statement and a solicitor's letter: by way of  example  no
         council tax, nothing from the electoral role.

      c) The Appellant's claimed EEA partner was not before  the  court  and
         had not provided a witness statement.

      d) She suggested that the Appellant's credibility was damaged  by  the
         discrepancies in relation to her son in that he was here  illegally
         under a false name.

      e) The bank statement produced does  not  support  her  claim  of  his
         earnings.

26. Ms Ampofu re iterated that Emmanuel was  her  biological  son  and  his
    father had changed his name and they had argued about it.



Findings

27. On balance and taking the evidence as  a  whole,  I  have  reached  the
    following findings

28. The Appellant is a 49 year old citizen of Ghana who has applied  for  a
    residence Card on the basis of her claimed   relationship  with  Mensah
    Quansah a Spanish citizen who she claims she married by proxy in  Ghana
    on 21 April 2012.

29. I am satisfied that the Appellant has  failed  to  establish  that  her
    proxy marriage was valid under Spanish Law  which  was  the  only  live
    issue in relation to the validity of the proxy marriage before me.  The
    letter from the Spanish Consul general dated 24 June 2014 that sets out
    the requirements for validity of a Spanish nationals marriage  requires
    that the marriage is registered at the  Spanish  Embassy  or  Consulate
    where the proxy marriage took place in this case Accra.  The  Appellant
    has now re produced the documents relating to her proxy marriage one of
    which now bears a stamp from  the  Spanish  Embassy  confirming  it  is
    authentic but not addressing the issue  of  whether  the  marriage  was
    registered as required under Spanish law.

30. Having failed to establish that her proxy  marriage  is  valid  I  have
    considered whether the Appellant can establish that she is in a durable
    relationship.

31.  The  Appellant,  I  remind  myself  bears  the  evidential  burden  of
    establishing her case either from documentary or oral  evidence.  While
    the Appellant was in court to give oral evidence  her  claimed  partner
    was not nor was there a statement from him. The Appellant cannot  claim
    to be ignorant of the importance of his confirming  their  relationship
    as she produced a  solicitor's  letter  dated  16  January  2015  which
    confirmed that witness statements would be required  for  the  hearing.
    Given that the genuine nature of their relationship is central  to  the
    case I find that the absence of evidence from her  claimed  partner  in
    any form is fatal to her appeal.

32. I am also satisfied that there is , in any event,  little  evidence  of
    the claimed relationship other than the documents in  relation  to  the
    proxy marriage. There is one letter, the solicitor's  letter,  to  show
    that the Appellant lives at the same address as her partner.  There  is
    one bank statement in his name with the same address. Given  her  claim
    that they have lived there for 6 months I do not find it credible  that
    there would be such a dearth of evidence relating to them sharing  this
    address if they were  both  living  there.  The  Appellant's  claim  in
    relation to her husband's employment, which might suggest  a  knowledge
    of his affairs that supported her claim, was not supported by his  bank
    statements.

33.  I  also  find  that  the  Appellant's  credibility  is   significantly
    undermined by the serious  discrepancies  in  relation  to  the  child,
    Emmanuel, who she claims is her son. In her visa application from  2004
    she accepts that this child had a different name and date of birth  and
    has been living in the United Kingdom illegally. I reject as incredible
    her explanation for the difference in names.

34. I have considered the issue  of  anonymity  in  the  present  instance.
    Neither party has sought a direction. The Appellant is an adult and not
    a vulnerable person. I see no reason to  make  any  direction  in  this
    regard.

Conclusion

35. I find that the Appellant has not discharged the burden of proof on him
    to show that the terms regulation 7 and 8(5)  of  the  Regulations  are
    met.

36. I therefore find that the decision of the Respondent  appealed  against
    is in accordance with the law and the applicable Regulations.

37. No order for anonymity is made.

DECISION

38. The appeal in respect of the EEA Regulations is dismissed.
