Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr I Richards, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

For the Respondents:   Mr Z Nasim instructed by Legal Rights Partnership

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008  (SI  2008/2698)  I  make  an  anonymity  order  prohibiting   the
    disclosure or publication of any matter likely to lead  to  members  of
    the public identifying the respondents (three of whom are children).  A
    failure to comply with this direction could lead to Contempt  of  Court
    proceedings.

 2. Although this is an appeal brought by the Secretary of  State,  I  will
    for convenience refer hereafter to the parties as they appeared  before
    the First-tier Tribunal

Background

 3. The five appellants (whom I will refer to respectively as A1,  A2,  A3,
    A4 and A5) are all citizens of Uganda.  They were born respectively  on
    29 October 1973, 29 November 1973, 8 July 2009, 26 September  2011  and
    15 May 1999.  A1 and A2 are husband and wife.   A3  and  A4  are  their
    children who were both born in the UK.  A5 is the  child  of  A2  as  a
    result of a previous relationship.

 4. A1 arrived in the UK on 24 January 2000 as a student.  He  was  granted
    leave to remain as a student which was periodically extended  until  30
    April 2009.

 5. A2 entered the UK on 3 October 2003 as a  Tier  4  Student  with  valid
    leave until 30 September 2005.  That leave  was  subsequently  extended
    until 31 October 2007.  Between October 2007  and  September  2008,  A2
    returned to Uganda for a nine-month period as  her  son,  A5  (who  was
    living in Uganda) was experiencing difficulties in school.  A2 returned
    to the UK as a dependant of A1 on 11 September  2008  and  was  granted
    leave in line with A1 until 30 April 2009.

 6. On 8 July 2009, A3 was born in the UK.  He is now 8 years and 6  months
    old.

 7. On 12 June 2009, A1 (together with A2 and A3 as his dependants) applied
    for further leave, albeit out of time, as a Tier 4 Student.  Because of
    difficulties over his  sponsor's  licence,  that  application  remained
    undetermined by the Secretary of State for  some  time.   On  30  March
    2010, A1, together with A2  and  A3,  made  an  application  for  leave
    outside the Rules under Art 8 of  the  ECHR.   On  28  July  2010,  the
    Secretary of State wrote to A1 pointing out that as  he  had  made  two
    applications, his student application had been "voided" on 21 July 2010
    and consideration was being given to his application outside the Rules.

 8. On 28 July 2010, the Secretary of State refused A1, A2 and A3 leave  to
    remain outside the Rules.  There was no right of  appeal  against  that
    decision and removal decisions were served on 19 June 2012.

 9. A1, A2 and A3 then appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal.   That  appeal
    was heard by Judge Seifert on  20  August  2012.   In  a  determination
    promulgated on 19 September 2012, he allowed the appeals of A1, A2  and
    A3 on the basis that their removal would breach Art 8 of the ECHR.

10. Thereafter, on 23 November 2012 A1, A2 and A3 were granted  30  months'
    leave to remain until 23 May 2015.

11. A4, who had been born in the UK on 26 September 2011, was also  granted
    leave to remain in line with A1, A2 and A3 until 23 May  2015  although
    he was not a party to the appeal.

12. In February 2015, A5, who is A2's child  by  a  previous  relationship,
    entered the UK with entry clearance and was granted leave to remain  in
    line with A1, A2, A3, and A4 until 23 May 2015.

13. On 22 May 2015, the appellants made applications for further  leave  to
    remain on human rights grounds.  On 16 October 2015, those applications
    were refused by the respondent.

The Appeals

14. The appellants appealed to First-tier Tribunal.  On 15  February  2017,
    Judge Rowlands allowed each of the appellants' appeals under Art  8  of
    the ECHR.

15. On 8 September 2017, the Secretary of State was granted  permission  to
    appeal by the First-tier Tribunal (Acting RJ Appleyard).

16. The appeal initially came before me on 7 November 2017.  In a  decision
    sent on 5 December 2017, I concluded that Judge Rowlands had  erred  in
    law in allowing the appellants' appeals under Art 8 and I set aside his
    decision.  My reasons are fully set out in my decision dated 1 December
    2017 and are not repeated here.

17. Having set aside the decision, I adjourned the appeals in order  for  a
    resumed hearing to take place before the Upper  Tribunal  in  order  to
    remake the decision under Art 8.

The Resumed Hearing

18. At the resumed hearing, the appellants were represented by Mr Nasim and
    the Secretary of State was represented by Mr Richards.

19. The appellants relied upon the evidence contained in the appeal  bundle
    submitted at the hearing before Judge Rowlands.  In addition, Mr  Nasim
    sought to rely upon a recent report concerning  A5  dated  28  December
    2017  from  a  registered  Speech  and  Language  Therapist,  Ms  Clare
    O'Driscoll.  I  admitted  that  document,  without  objection  from  Mr
    Richards, under rule 15(2A) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)
    Rules 2008 (SI 2008/2698 as amended).

The Submissions

20. On behalf of the appellants, Mr Nasim relied upon his skeleton argument
    which he amplified in his oral submissions.

21. In summary, Mr Nasim submitted that the appellants' removal would be  a
    disproportionate interference with their private life in  the  UK.   He
    submitted that the starting point was Judge Seifert's decision in  2012
    that their removal would be disproportionate and had led to  the  grant
    of 30 months'  leave  to  each  of  the  appellants.   The  appellants'
    position, he submitted, had only strengthened since then.  He submitted
    that, applying s.117B(6) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act
    2002 ("the NIA Act 2002"), it was  not  reasonable   to  expect  A3  (a
    "qualifying child") to leave the UK and consequent it was  not  in  the
    public interest to remove his parents A1 and A2 and, of course, A4  and
    A5 could not then be removed either.  More generally, however, Mr Nasim
    submitted that striking the 'fair balance' required  in  assessing  the
    proportionality of removing the appellants as a family, the impact upon
    all of the appellants was such as to make removal disproportionate.

22. In support of his submissions, Mr Nasim  relied  upon  Judge  Seifert's
    recitation of the evidence (which had been accepted) and  his  findings
    at [25]-[40] of his determination.

23. Mr Nasim relied upon the residence of A1 and A2 in the UK for  eighteen
    and fourteen years respectively.  He relied upon their  integration  in
    the UK, together with that of their children, through their church  and
    through the children's schooling and friendships.  A2 was also employed
    working with children and young adults with severe autism.

24. Mr Nasim placed reliance upon the fact that A3 and A4 were born in  the
    UK and had been living in the UK respectively  for  eight  and  a  half
    years and six years and two months.  Both had only been to  Uganda  for
    one short period of three weeks in 2012.

25. Mr Nasim also placed reliance upon the circumstances of A5.  Although a
    young adult, he was a person who  suffered  from  significant  learning
    difficulties, was probably on the Autistic Spectrum and  suffered  from
    Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD).  Mr Seifert placed reliance upon  the
    witness statement of A1 at pages 1-8 of the bundle and of A2 at pages 9-
    10 of the bundle.  In addition, he relied  upon  a  number  of  medical
    reports relating to A5 at pages 15-21 of the bundle and Ms O'Driscoll's
    report dated 28 December 2017.  He also relied upon a letter of support
    from the respective college and school of A5 and of A3 and A4 at  pages
    22-23 of the bundle.

26. As regards s.117B(6), Mr Nasim submitted that as A3  is  a  "qualifying
    child", applying the Court of Appeal's decision in R (MA (Pakistan) and
    Others) v SSHD [2016]  EWCA  Civ  705  there  had  to  be  "strong"  or
    "powerful reasons" not to grant leave.  Mr Nasim submitted that it  was
    in A3's best interest to remain in the UK and that there were no strong
    or powerful reason which would justify requiring him to  leave  the  UK
    and not be granted leave.  As a consequence, Mr  Nasim  submitted  that
    each of the appellants' appeals should be allowed.

27. More generally, he submitted that taking the evidence as  a  whole  and
    addressing the ultimate issue of striking a fair  balance  between  the
    individuals' interests and the public interest,  the  strength  of  the
    public interest was not  such  as  to  outweigh  the  impact  upon  the
    appellants as a family if removed to Uganda.  Mr Nasim  invited  me  to
    take into account Judge Seifert's decision in 2012 and, in his skeleton
    argument, made reference to the respondent's IDI Instructions Chapter 9
    of Section 1  which  cautioned  against  refusing  applications  where,
    previously, discretion to depart from the  Rules  had  previously  been
    exercised.  He also relied on the fact  that  the  appellants  had,  in
    fact, been encouraged in their expectation of remaining in the UK,  not
    only by the grant to them of 30 months' leave, but also  the  Secretary
    of State's decision to allow A5 to enter the UK and be granted leave in
    line with them.

28. On behalf of the respondent, Mr Richards accepted that s.117B(6), if it
    applied, was a 'trump card' in  that  the  public  interest  would  not
    require the removal of A1 and A2.  However, Mr Richards invited  me  to
    find that it would not be unreasonable for A3 to be expected  to  leave
    the UK and live in Uganda.  Although he had been here for eight  and  a
    half years, Mr Richards relied on the fact that he was not in secondary
    education.  He submitted that the later that the seven-year period  was
    in a child's life, the more it was in favour of that child  to  respect
    of his education in this country.  He submitted that there was  nothing
    unreasonable in removing A3 when he was in primary education and  would
    be returning to Uganda with his whole family.

29. Looking at Art 8 more widely, Mr Richards  submitted  that  the  public
    interest  could  only  be  outweighed   if   there   were   "compelling
    circumstances" so as to produce an unjustifiably harsh consequence.  He
    accepted that the appeals of A1, A2 and A3 had been allowed in 2012 and
    that they had subsequently been granted  30  months'  leave  which  had
    arguably encouraged them to strengthen their  roots  in  this  country.
    That, he acknowledged, had further  been  encouraged  arguably  by  the
    admission of A5 in 2015.  Mr Richards invited me to have regard to  the
    determination of Judge Seifert and any strengthening of the appellants'
    position subsequently in respect of Art 8.  He invited me to weigh  the
    whole of the  evidence  and  give  appropriate  weight  to  the  public
    interest.  He submitted that it was a matter for my judgment whether or
    not the factors relied upon by the appellants amounted  to  "compelling
    circumstances" so as to make their removal disproportionate.

The Law

30. In these appeals, the appellants rely upon Art 8 outside the Rules.  Mr
    Nasim did not suggest, either in his skeleton argument or in  his  oral
    submissions, that the appellants have any claim under the Rules whether
    based upon their family or private life  in  the  UK.   His  focus  was
    entirely upon Art 8 outside the Rules.

31. In that regard, I must  approach  the  decision  in  a  structured  way
    applying the five-stage test in R (Razgar) v SSHD  [2004]  UKHL  27  at
    [17].

32. The appellants rely, in effect, upon an interference with their private
    life if removed to Uganda.  As they will be removed as a family,  there
    will be no interference with their family life as such.

33. The crucial issue, upon which both parties' representatives focused  in
    their submissions, is that of proportionality.  That issue  requires  a
    fair balance to be struck between the public interest  and  the  rights
    and interests of the appellants protected by Art  8.1  (see  Razgar  at
    [20]).  In R (MM and Others) (Lebanon)  v  SSHD  [2017]  UKSC  10,  the
    Supreme Court reminded us at [43] that the "central issue" is:

         "Whether a fair  balance  has  been  struck  between  the  personal
         interests of all members of the family in maintaining their  family
         [or private] life  ...  and  the  public  interest  in  controlling
         immigration".

34. I must take into account the "best interests of the children, namely A3
    and A4 as a primary,  but  not  determinative,  consideration  (see  ZH
    (Tanzania) v SSHD [2011] UKSC 4 and Zoumbas v SSHD [2013]  UKSC  74  at
    [10]).

35. In carrying out that  balancing  exercise  in  reaching  a  finding  on
    proportionality, I must "have regard"  to  the  consideration  set  out
    s.117B of the NIA Act 2002.  S.117B is in the following terms:

         "117B Art 8: public interest considerations applicable in all cases

         (1)  The maintenance of effective immigration controls  is  in  the
             public interest.

         (2)  It is in  the  public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
             interests of the economic well-being of  the  United  Kingdom,
             that persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom
             are able to speak  English,  because  persons  who  can  speak
             English -

             (a)  are less of a burden on taxpayers, and

             (b)  are better able to integrate into society.

         (3)  It is in  the  public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
             interests of the economic well-being of  the  United  Kingdom,
             that persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom
             are financially independent, because such persons -

             (a)  are not a burden on taxpayers, and

             (b)  are better able to integrate into society.

         (4)  Little weight should be given to -

             (a)  a private life, or

             (b)  a relationship formed with a qualifying partner, that  is
                  established by a person at a time when the  person  is  in
                  the United Kingdom unlawfully.

         (5)  Little weight should be given to a private life established by
             a person at a time when the  person's  immigration  status  is
             precarious.

         (6)  In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation,  the
             public interest does not require the person's removal where -

             (a)   the  person  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting   parental
                  relationship with a qualifying child, and

             (b)  it would not be reasonable to expect the child  to  leave
                  the United Kingdom."

36. The public interest, including that reflected  in  the  fact  that  the
    appellants cannot meet the requirements of the Rules,  is  entitled  to
    "considerable weight" (see MM at [75];  and  also  Hesham  Ali  v  SSHD
    [2016] UKSC 6 at [46] et seq and R (Agyarko and Another) v SSHD  [2017]
    UKSC 11 at [46]-[48].  The  search  is  for  "sufficiently  compelling"
    circumstances to outweigh the public interest because  the  refusal  of
    leave would result in "unjustifiably harsh consequences"  (see  Agyarko
    at [48] and [70]).

37. In relation to s.117B(6), the proper approach was set out by the  Court
    of Appeal in MA (Pakistan).  First, the  Court  of  Appeal  recognised,
    that if s.117B(6) applied, because it would be unreasonable to expect a
    qualifying child to leave the UK, then the parents' removal  would  not
    be in the public interest and, as a result, their removal would  breach
    Art 8 of the ECHR.  Secondly, in determining whether it would  "not  be
    reasonable to expect" such a child to leave  the  UK,  not  only  their
    circumstances must be taken into account, but also the public  interest
    must be factored in.  The Court of Appeal approved the approach in  its
    earlier decision of MM  (Uganda)  v  SSHD  [2016]  EWCA  Civ  450  when
    considering, in the context of a deportation case,  s.117C(5)  and  the
    requirement that the affect of deportation on a partner or a child must
    be "unduly harsh" in order for  the  public  interest  not  to  require
    deportation of a person sentenced to a period of imprisonment  of  less
    than four years.  At [45] in MA (Pakistan), Elias LJ (with whom King LJ
    and Sir Stephen Richards agreed) stated:

         "In my judgment, if the court should have regard to the conduct  of
         the applicant in any other matters relevant to the public  interest
         when applying the 'unduly harsh' concept under Section 117C(5),  so
         should it when in considering the question of reasonableness  under
         Section 117B(6)."

38. However, in dealing with  the  application  of  s.117B(6)  involving  a
    "qualifying child" (whether as  a  British  citizen  or  who  has  been
    resident in the UK for at least seven years), Elias LJ  recognised  (at
    [46]):

         "After such a period of time the child will have put down roots and
         developed social, cultural and educational links  in  the  UK  such
         that it is likely to be highly disruptive if the child is  required
         to leave the UK.  That may be less so when the  children  are  very
         young because the focus of their  lives  would  be  more  on  their
         families, but the disruption  becomes  more  serious  as  they  get
         older.  Moreover, in these  cases  there  must  be  a  very  strong
         expectation that the child's best interest will be to remain in the
         UK with his parents as part of a family unit, and that must rank as
         a  primary  consideration  in  the   proportionality   assessment."



39. Finally, as indeed Elias LJ pointed out, a child's "best interest"  are
    not determinative of whether it would be reasonable to expect the child
    to leave the UK but are a significant factor such that  there  must  be
    "powerful" or "strong" reasons why leave should  not  be  granted.   In
    other words, in order to show that it would be reasonable to expect the
    child to leave the UK.



Discussion

40. I turn then to apply the five-stage in Razgar.

41. First, I accept that the appellants' removal to Uganda  will  interfere
    with their private life in the UK sufficiently seriously to engage  Art
    8.1.  I accept that all the appellants are imbedded in the UK.  A1  has
    lived in the UK for eighteen years and A2 has lived here  for  fourteen
    years.   A3  and  A4  (who  were  each  born  in  the  UK)  have  lived
    respectively for eight and a half years and six years and  two  months.
    A5 has been in the UK since 2015.  A1 was previously a student  and  is
    now himself employed as a driver for Uber.  A2 is employed at a special
    boarding school for children and young adults with severe autism and is
    currently pursuing  a  Level  3  Diploma  in  Residential  Child  Care,
    sponsored by her employer.  There is supporting evidence concerning  A1
    and A2's involvement in their local community and  church  and  of  the
    involvement of A3 and A4 at school and of A5 at his college where, as a
    result of his severe learning difficulties, it is readily apparent (not
    least  from  the  recent  report  of  Ms  O'Driscoll)   that   A5   had
    significantly benefited from his attendance at college.

42. Mr Richards did not seek to argue the contrary and I accept that if the
    appellants were removed to Uganda there would be a sufficiently serious
    interference with their private life in the UK such  that  Art  8.1  is
    engaged.

43. As regards Art 8.2, the respondent's decisions are in  accordance  with
    the law and the appellants' removal is for a legitimate aim, namely the
    maintenance of effective immigration control (see s.117B(1) of the 2002
    Act) as none of the appellants have any  basis  under  the  Immigration
    Rules to remain in the UK.

44. The crucial issue is, therefore, whether  the  appellants'  removal  is
    justified as being  a  proportionate  interference  with  their  Art  8
    rights.  That, as I have already pointed out, requires a  balancing  of
    their individual interests and rights against the  public  interest  in
    effective immigration control.

45. In reaching my decision I bear in mind that the appellants do not argue
    they can succeed under any relevant 'Art 8 rule',  in  particular  para
    276ADE.  A1 and A2 do  not,  therefore,  argue  that  there  are  "very
    significant obstacles" to their integration in Nigeria.  Of course, and
    I  did  not  understand  this  to  be  disputed,  the  terms  of   para
    276ADE(1)(iv) mirror those of s.117B(6) as applied to A3.

46. I must "have regard" to the considerations listed in s.117B of the  NIA
    Act 2002.  It was not suggested before me that the  particular  aspects
    of the public interest set out in s.117B(2) and (3) were  engaged.   It
    is not suggested that the appellants are not  able  to  speak  English.
    Further, there is evidence, which has not been challenged, that  A2  is
    employed earning �20,000 (see para 15 of A1's  witness  statement)  and
    also that A1 is a self-employed taxi  driver  for  Uber.   It  was  not
    suggested before me by Mr Richards,  on  behalf  of  the  Secretary  of
    State, that the appellants were other than  "financially  independent".
    But, of course, s.117B(2) and (3) can give no positive impetus  to  the
    appellants' claim: at best they are neutral (see Rhuppiah v SSHD [2016]
    EWCA Civ 803 at [59] and [61]).

47. Turning now to s.117B(4) and (5), "little weight" is  to  be  given  to
    private life formed at a time when an individual is  either  unlawfully
    in the UK or his or her "immigration status  is  precarious".   I  have
    already  set  out  the  immigration  history  of  the  appellants,  and
    particularly of A1 and A2 above.  A1 has been in the UK  since  January
    2000.  His leave as a student expired on 30  April  2009.   There  have
    been a number of gaps,  albeit  relatively  brief  in  length,  in  his
    periods of lawful leave which are set out at [44]  of  Judge  Seifert's
    determination, namely between 31 January 2003 and 4 February  2003;  10
    February 2005 and 25 February 2005; and 28 February 2006 and  25  April
    2006.  After 30 April 2009, when A1's leave as a  student  expired,  he
    was next granted leave with effect from 23 November 2012 until  23  May
    2015.  His subsequent  in-time  application  -  the  subject  of  these
    appeals  -  resulted  in  his  leave  continuing  under  s.3C  of   the
    Immigration Act 1971.

48. A2 has been in the UK since October 2003 but  with  a  break  when  she
    returned to Uganda between  October  2007  and  2008.   Her  leave,  in
    effect, reflects that of A1.

49. There have, therefore, been times when A1 and A2 were  not  in  the  UK
    lawfully and, to that extent, it can be said that  their  private  life
    was built up, at least in  part,  during  periods  to  which  s.117B(4)
    applied and, at least in principle, at other  times  their  status  was
    "precarious" such that s.117B(5) applied.  However,  it  is  recognised
    that the application of  s.117B(5)  (and  also  s.117B(4))  has  to  be
    context specific involving a "notional sliding  scale"  depending  upon
    the circumstances (see, Treebhawan and Others  (NIAA  2002  Part  5A  -
    compelling circumstances  test)  [2017]  UKUT  13  (IAC)  at  [45]  and
    Rhuppiah v SSHD [2016] EWCA Civ 803).  There are, in my judgment,  good
    reason to attach significant weight to the private life of A1 and A2 in
    the UK.  First, Judge Seifert accepted A1's explanation for the  breaks
    in his continuous lawful residence set out at [46] et  seq.   The  gaps
    were, in general, small and in a number of cases arose  from  initially
    invalid applications being made  rather  than  initially  out  of  time
    applications to  extend  leave.   Further,  shortly  after  A1's  leave
    expired in April 2009, he applied in June 2009 for further leave  as  a
    student which remain unresolved because of problems with the licence of
    his sponsor college but which in March  2010  resulted  in  a  new  (or
    varied)  application  for  leave  under  Art  8  which  was  ultimately
    successful, albeit  that  it  required  an  appeal  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and leave was only granted to the  appellant  thereafter  from
    November 2012.  That grant of leave of 30 months  was,  of  course,  in
    response to the new (or varied) application made two  years  and  eight
    months  earlier.   Consequently,  although  there  is  a  gap  in   the
    appellant's leave between April 2009 and  November  2012,  it  is  only
    right to recognise that the ultimate grant of  leave  stemmed  from  an
    application made initially in June 2009 and, in its ultimate  form,  in
    March 2010.

50. Secondly, all the appellants have been granted 30 months' leave outside
    the Rules under Art 8 and, I accept, this has  created  an  expectation
    that their stay in the UK will be  recognised  by  the  UK  Government.
    That expectation was enhanced by  the  admission  of  A5,  despite  not
    complying with the Immigration  Rules,  on  a  compassionate  basis  in
    February 2015 as a dependant of A2.  A1 and A2 have,  in  my  judgment,
    effectively been led to believe that their family circumstances merited
    them being granted leave to remain  in  the  UK.   Those  circumstances
    since Judge Seifert's decision and the grant of  leave  that  followed,
    have not weakened but rather have been enhanced as the appellants  have
    further set down roots and integrated into life in the  UK.   In  those
    circumstances, it is right in my judgment to give significant weight to
    the private life the appellants have in the  UK  when  considering  the
    impact upon them of removal.

51. The positions of A3, A4 and A5 are,  in  my  judgment,  no  worse  and,
    indeed, it would be wrong to  count  against  those  appellants,  given
    their ages and, in the case of A5, his learning difficulties that their
    private life was established and developed during any  periods  without
    leave (see Akinyemi v SSHD [2007] EWCA Civ 236) or whilst they had only
    temporary leave (see MA (Pakistan) at [103]).

52.  I  now  turn  to  consider  s.117B(6)  upon  which  Mr  Nasim   placed
    considerable reliance.  That requires me to determine  whether  it  has
    been established that it would be reasonable to expect A3 to leave  the
    UK.  It is accepted that A3 is a "qualifying  child"  as  a  result  of
    having been resident in the UK for at least seven years (see  s.117D(1)
    of the NIA Act 2002) that A1 and A2 each have a "genuine and subsisting
    parental relationship" with A3.

53. A3 has lived in the UK for eight and a half years since his birth.   He
    attends school and his progress there is attested to in the letter from
    his head teacher dated 18 November 2016 (at page 23 of the bundle).  It
    was not suggested before me that A3 has not integrated into life in the
    UK by attending school and through friendships.  He  is  also  involved
    with the family's church and has been baptised  and  is  close  to  his
    godparent (see A1's statement at para 11, page 4 of the bundle).

54. The evidence, which I accept, is that A3 has only visited Uganda for  a
    period of three weeks in 2012.  He has extended family in Uganda as set
    out in para 16 of A1's statement.  His paternal grandfather is deceased
    and his maternal grandmother lives in  the  USA.   However,  he  has  a
    paternal uncle who runs a small fish farm and grows  coffee  beans  who
    is, himself, married with two children.  On the maternal side, he has a
    maternal grandmother and two uncles who are subsistence level  farmers.
    The evidence is, and I accept it  and  it  is  unchallenged,  that  the
    appellants will have no home to offer their children and no savings  to
    take with them to assist them (see para 17 of A1's statement) at page 6
    of the bundle).  I also accept the evidence (at para 17 and 18 of  A1's
    statement at page 6 of the bundle) that A3 will have  to  adjust  to  a
    "completely new education system" although I bear in mind that he is at
    a relatively young age and is in  primary  school.   I  accept,  as  Mr
    Richards submitted, that the impact upon a child will be greater as  he
    or she develops in age.

55. I  also  accept  that  the  employment  prospects  of  A1  and  A2  are
    necessarily  speculative  in  Uganda.   There  will,  in  my   judgment
    undoubtedly be a damaging transition for the family, including A3.

56. Whilst I accept that it is generally in the best interests of  a  child
    to remain with his or her parents, in this context  by  returning  with
    them  to  Uganda,  I  am  also  satisfied  on  the  basis  of  all  the
    circumstances I have set out above that the impact  upon  A3  of  being
    uprooted from the UK and  return  to  Uganda  which,  for  intents  and
    purposes is a foreign  country  to  him,  would  not  be  in  his  best
    interests.   That  is  a  relevant  but  not  determinative  factor  in
    assessing whether it would be reasonable to expect him to leave the UK.
     That taken with the length of his residence in the UK, requires as the
    Court of Appeal pointed out in MA  (Pakistan),  "strong"  or  "powerful
    reasons" to justify a conclusion that it would be reasonable for him to
    leave the UK.

57. I must consider the public interest and balance it against  the  impact
    upon A3 of being removed.  Here, the public interest is engaged in that
    none of the appellants (but in particular A1 and A2) have any basis for
    remaining in the UK under the Immigration Rules.  That  said,  however,
    their immigration history is important as I have set out above.  A1 and
    A2 have, as I have already pointed out, been granted 30  months'  leave
    on the basis of their circumstances and A5 was  allowed  to  join  them
    despite not meeting the entry clearance requirements under  the  Rules.
    They have, in effect, been led  to  believe  that  their  circumstances
    justified them remaining in the UK as a family.  Although A1 (and A2 as
    a result) has not always been lawfully in the UK, his lengthy residence
    since 2000 has, by and large, been with leave.  The breaks in his leave
    have been brief in duration as I set  out  above.   Equally,  the  last
    grant of leave was as a result of an application initially made in June
    2009, even if it was only varied to an application under Art 8 in March
    2010.  Judge Seifert accepted A1's evidence concerning the evolution of
    that application, initially as a student and the  consequent  delay  in
    determining it by the Secretary of State because  of  issues  over  the
    sponsor's licence, and it was not suggested before me that the position
    was otherwise.  Consequently, although there appears, on  the  face  of
    it, it had been a lengthy period when A1 did  not  have  leave  between
    April 2009 and November 2012, in fact the grant of leave recognised (as
    a result of a successful appeal) the merits  of  A1's  application  for
    leave at least as varied in March 2010.

58. It was not suggested before me that the public interest had any content
    beyond  effective  immigration  control.  There  is,  for  example,  no
    suggestion of any public interest based upon  offending  or  deliberate
    evasion of immigration control in the UK.

59. Bearing in mind the approach in MA (Pakistan) which I set out above,  I
    am satisfied that the impact upon A3 of being uprooted from the  UK  is
    sufficiently significant to outweigh the public interest.  I find  that
    it would not be reasonable to expect A3 to now leave the UK.

60. In the light of that finding, I am satisfied that s.117B(6) applies and
    that the "public interest does not require" the removal of  A1  and  A2
    who are A3's parents.

61. If A1 and A2 (together with A3 as para 276ADE(1)(iv) applies) cannot be
    removed, it was not suggested before me that it  was  proportionate  to
    remove A4 and A5.

62. I do, however,  go  on  to  consider  the  proportionality  issue  more
    generally.

63. In my judgment, when the circumstances of A4 and, in  particularly,  A5
    are factored in, it is clear that there  are  compelling  circumstances
    giving rise to unjustifiably harsh consequences sufficient to  outweigh
    the public interest.  Particularly important, in my  judgment,  is  the
    position of A5.  It is clear from all the  documentation  that  A5  has
    severe learning difficulties and is probably on the  Autistic  Spectrum
    and suffers from ADD.  The evidence is  that  he  had  difficulties  in
    mainstream schools in Uganda where no provision for  special  education
    needs is made (see A2 statement  at  page  10  of  the  bundle).   That
    evidence is not challenged before me.   The  evidence  dating  back  to
    2015, when A5 first entered the UK, is at pages 15-22  of  the  bundle,
    including letters from healthcare professionals and his  college  which
    he attends.  That background is further amplified in the recent  report
    by Ms O'Driscoll dated 28 December 2017.  A5 plainly has  communication
    and other difficulties in social contexts.  The report states that A5:

         "presents as a young man with complex communication needs over  and
         above his learning difficulties."

64. The report continues that A5's ability: "to express himself verbally is
    very limited in most circumstances."

65. Ms O'Driscoll continues that A5's

         "responses and observations of those working with him suggest  that
         there may be psychological factors impacting on  his  communication
         that means he would benefit from further psychological  assessment.
         [A5] is also likely to  need  support  going  into  the  future  to
         maximise his opportunities for employment and socialising."

66. His wellbeing has improved as a result of attending  the  college  (see
    A2's statement at page 9 of the bundle and a letter from the college at
    page 22 of the bundle).  If he were to  return  to  Uganda,  even  with
    family, I am satisfied that this would have a deleterious  effect  upon
    his education and wellbeing.  It was those  factors  which  led  A2  to
    return to live in Uganda between October 2007 and  September  2008  and
    subsequent to seek entry clearance for A5 to  live  in  the  UK.   That
    entry clearance was, of course, subsequently  granted  even  though  A5
    could not satisfy the requirements in the Rules as A2 was  not  settled
    in the UK.  It is a reasonable inference that the needs of A5  were  at
    the heart of the Secretary of State's decision to grant  leave  outside
    the Rules.  As A5 is no longer a child, it is not strictly necessary to
    take into account his best interests as such.  However,  his  interests
    are relevant as reflecting on the impact upon him and his private  life
    if he were to return to Uganda.  I am satisfied  that  those  interests
    would not be served by that occurring.

67. Carrying out the balancing exercise, Mr Nasim invited me to take  Judge
    Seifert's decision as a 'starting point'.  I do so to the  extent  that
    it represents an unassailable conclusion that in 2012  the  removal  of
    A1, A2 and A3 would breach Art 8 of the ECHR.

68. I accept Mr Nasim's submission that the position  of  the  family,  now
    taking into account also of A5, has only strengthened since that  time.
    By contrast, the public interest had grown no stronger in fact.

69. Taking the circumstances as a whole, as  I  have  set  out  above,  the
    removal of the appellants is, in my  judgment,  not  proportionate.   I
    bear in mind the "best interests" of A3 and A4 and the impact  upon  A5
    of removal.  I also bear in mind the circumstances which the family, as
    a whole, would face in Uganda where, despite  having  extended  family,
    they have no home and it is likely that their  circumstances  would  be
    significantly  adversely  impacted  upon.    I   bear   in   mind   the
    circumstances, in particular, of A1 and A2 and their long residence  in
    the UK including their immigration history as I have set out above.   I
    have regard to the public interest in  effective  immigration  control.
    In my judgment, weighing these factors against one and  another,  there
    are  "compelling"   circumstances   such   that   unjustifiably   harsh
    consequences  will  follow  for  this  family  if  removed  which   are
    sufficient to outweigh the public interest and  leads  me  to  conclude
    that their removal would not be proportionate.

70. For these reasons, therefore, I am satisfied that the  removal  of  the
    appellants would breach Art 8 of the ECHR.

Decision

71. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal to allow the appellants' appeal
    under Art 8 was set aside by my decision sent on 5 December 2017.

72. I remake the decision allowing each of the  appellants'  appeals  under
    Art 8 of the ECHR.
