Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr Barnnfield, Counsel
For the respondent:    Mr Mills, Senior Presenting Officer


                             DECISION AND REASONS


1. The appellants are nationals of Somalia  born  on  25  November  1970,  8
   February 2005, 7 February 2006 and on 5 January 2004  respectively.  They
   appealed against the decisions of the respondent dated 15 September  2014
   to refuse to grant them entry clearances as  the  partner  and  dependent
   children of a person present and settled  in  the  United  Kingdom  under
   Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.


2. Permission to appeal was  granted  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Grant
   Hutchinson who stated it was arguable that the Judge erred in law in  his
   approach to assessing the child who lives in the United Kingdom's illness
   when he went out to see his father and siblings and that he is unable  to
   return for any length of time. The Judge also failed to make findings  in
   relation to the fact that the sponsor  would  never  meet  the  financial
   threshold of the  Immigration  Rules  in  terms  of  the  proportionality
   assessment. The Judge failed to make clear findings in  relation  to  the
   job offer available to the appellant on entry and failing to consider the
   best interests of the child in the United Kingdom to  be  separated  from
   his father and siblings who continue to live in Ethiopia without  status.
   The Judge also failed to consider that the children to be separated  from
   their mother and younger sibling and the impact that will  have  on  them
   all as the Judge accepted that the children need to  live  with  both  of
   their parents.


3. The grounds  of  appeal  state  the  following  which  I  summarise.  The
   Tribunal erred when it failed to consider material evidence  and  matters
   and failed to make clear findings on material evidence. The Judge  failed
   to give adequate reasons which  affects  the  Tribunal's  proportionality
   assessment under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and
   renders the decision unsafe.


4. The judge made the following findings in the decision which I  summarise.
   It is conceded by the respondent  that  the  appellants  are  related  as
   claimed as this evidence  is  supported  by  DNA  evidence.  It  is  also
   accepted that the respondent can no longer rely on her allegations as  to
   the validity of their marriage. It  is  noted  that  when  the  appellant
   married her second husband,  she  applied  to  join  him  in  the  United
   Kingdom. Entry clearance was granted because the entry clearance  officer
   was satisfied that she was  divorced  from  her  first  husband  and  was
   validly married to her  second  husband.  The  sponsor  cannot  meet  the
   maintenance requirements of the Immigration Rules his sponsor only  earns
   �600 per month.


5. In respect of Article 8, the Immigration Rules are a  complete  code  but
   they do not fully address the private and family life issues in this case
   and therefore a full proportionality exercise must  be  conducted  before
   any  conclusion  can  be  reached.  The  Judge  was  satisfied  that  the
   appellant, the sponsor and the British child  all  enjoy  a  family  life
   together. The Judge was satisfied that the sponsor and her youngest child
   have visited the appellant and their children in Ethiopia. Therefore, the
   Judge held that there will  be  interference  by  the  exclusion  of  the
   appellant from the United Kingdom.


6. The Judge stated that the decision is however in accordance with the  law
   and the only issue remains is whether the decision is proportionate.  The
   Judge noted the following which I summarise. There was  no  challenge  to
   the sponsor's evidence that she lives in  the  United  Kingdom  with  the
   youngest child of the family. She has no other relatives  in  the  United
   Kingdom. Her evidence is accepted that she is the sole carer of the child
   in the United Kingdom. The child is a British citizen and is not required
   to leave the United Kingdom for any reason to go and  live  in  Ethiopia.
   The appellant's evidence is that she has visited the appellant's in  2011
   and twice in 2013. The evidence is that in 2013  she  left  the  youngest
   child with his father and siblings because she wanted all the children to
   get to know one another. The sponsor's evidence  is  that  the  appellant
   does not work in a Ethiopia because he does not have any permission to do
   so. The judge stated "I accept the sponsor has three  minor  children  in
   Ethiopia and the do need to live with both parents". The evidence is that
   they have continued to maintain contact with the sponsor by telephone and
   other means of communication. The sponsor's evidence is  that  her  three
   children and husband reside in one room and  live  in  a  very  difficult
   circumstances. The children have no permission or funds to attend school.
   The appellant has failed to submit supporting evidence of the appellant's
   circumstances  in  Ethiopia.  The  sponsor's  evidence  is  that  if  the
   appellant comes the United Kingdom he has a job waiting for him with  the
   Khadra Daycare dated 24 June 2014. After hearing Counsel,  who  explained
   that the job offer is to Mr Cusmaan whose date of birth  is  25  November
   1970 and these are identity details in Somalia for  the  main  appellant.
   The Centre manager who wrote the letter did not attend the court to  give
   any evidence. The sponsor says that she only works 8 � hours a  week  and
   her son attends nursery. There was no evidence for why  she  cannot  work
   full-time and leave her son  and  full-time  nursery  care  to  meet  the
   requirements of the Immigration Rules. The decision therefore to  exclude
   the appellant and the children is proportionate.


7. At the hearing I heard submissions from both parties. On  behalf  of  the
   appellant it was submitted that  the  Judge's  approach  to  the  child's
   illness was flawed. He said that the Sponsor's evidence that she works  8
   � hours a week and only earns �5000 per annum. It is  conceded  that  the
   Immigration Rules were never going to be met. The Judge took into account
   that the sponsor was not working full-time. The evidence of a  job  offer
   should have been taken as compelling circumstances. There is not adequate
   reasoning as to the best  interests  of  the  British  child.  The  Judge
   concludes in his decision that the family are  a  family  unit  and  that
   children and parents should live together. And paragraph 30 there  is  no
   analysis of section 55 of the Boarder's Citizenship Act.


8. Mr Mills on behalf of the Secretary of State  submitted  that  separation
   was the choice of the sponsor many years ago and there has  been  ongoing
   contact. The sponsor has maintained family contact by  visiting  Ethiopia
   in 2011 and 2013. The British child can go back  two  Ethiopia  with  the
   family unit. The British child did go back  two  Ethiopia  in  2013.  The
   Judge was entitled to find that the appellant sponsor  should  work  more
   hours and try to meet the Immigration Rules. The job offer is not a sound
   one because it is for a teacher  when  there  is  no  evidence  that  the
   appellant is qualified to teach. The child has been in this  country  for
   only three years and can live aboard with his family. EX1  says  that  in
   certain circumstances, it is reasonable for the child to go  abroad.  The
   respondent's legitimate aim was considered to be important which it is.


   Decision as to whether there is an error of law


9. I have considered the decision of the  first-tier  Tribunal,  grounds  of
   appeal and the submissions made before me at the hearing. It was accepted
   that the only issue before the First-tier Tribunal Judge  to  be  decided
   was the question of proportionality in excluding the appellants from  the
   United Kingdom.


10. The Judge considered all the evidence in  this  appeal  and  came  to  a
   sustainable conclusion. It is inherent from his decision that  the  Judge
   took into account that the decision to leave her husband and children  in
   Ethiopia was that of the sponsor. The Judge was aware that  there  was  a
   British citizen child and from the reading of the entire decision, it  is
   apparent that he took the interests of the child  into  account  when  he
   said that they should all live together. That does  not  mean  that  they
   should all live together in the United Kingdom. The Judge stated that the
   family have maintained contact with each other by  the  sponsor  visiting
   the appellant and her children in Ethiopia. The Judge concluded that  the
   sponsor and the British child who has not been in this country for  seven
   years, can join the appellant and their children and have a  family  life
   together in that country. He said it would not be unreasonable to  expect
   the British child to leave the United Kingdom and live with his family in
   Ethiopia. The Judge took into account that  the  best  interests  of  the
   British child is to live with his family wherever they live. This is  not
   a perverse conclusion.


11. The Judge took into account the evidence that the appellant  has  a  job
   offer as a teacher in the United Kingdom. The judge was entitled to  find
   that it is not a credible job offer because there is no evidence that the
   appellant is or has ever taught in his life or  is  capable  of  being  a
   teacher. On the evidence the judge's conclusion  cannot  be  said  to  be
   perverse.


12. I find that  the  differently  constituted  Tribunal  would  not  decide
   differently on the evidence in this appeal.  I  find  that  there  is  no
   material error of law in the decision and I uphold it.
