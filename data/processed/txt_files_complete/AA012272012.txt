For the Appellant:     Ms M Knorr instructed by Ty Arian, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr K Hibbs, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This appeal is subject to an anonymity order  made  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal pursuant to  rule  45(4)(i)  of  the  Asylum  and  Immigration
    Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005 (SI 2005/230).  Neither  party  invited
    me to rescind the order and I continue it pursuant to rule  14  of  the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (SI 2008/2698).





The Background



 2. The appellant is a citizen of Libya who was born on 30  December  1990.
    He arrived in the United Kingdom on 19 April 2011 and claimed asylum on
    4 May 2011.  The appellant claimed to fear return to Libya  because  he
    would be killed by rebels as he had assisted his brother and cousin who
    were employed in the internal security service with the Gaddafi  regime
    and he had identified persons to them  involved  in  demonstrations  so
    that they could be apprehended.

 3. On 20 January 2012, the Secretary  of  State  refused  the  appellant's
    claim for asylum under para 336 of the Immigration  Rules  (HC  395  as
    amended) and for humanitarian  protection  under  para  339C  of  those
    Rules.  The Secretary  of  State  concluded  that  there  were  serious
    reasons for considering that the appellant had been involved in  crimes
    against humanity in Libya.  As a consequence, the  Secretary  of  State
    concluded that Art 1F(a) of the  Refugee  Convention  applied  and  the
    appellant was excluded from protection under that Convention.  Further,
    the appellant was also excluded from humanitarian protection by  virtue
    of para 339D(i) of the  Immigration  Rules.   The  Secretary  of  State
    certified  the  appeal  under  s.55  of  the  Immigration,  Asylum  and
    Nationality Act 2006.  Finally, the Secretary of State concluded  that,
    even if the appellant's account was accepted, he would not be  at  risk
    on return to Libya because it  would  be  open  to  him  internally  to
    relocate safely away from his home area in Tripoli.

 4. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  In a  determination
    dated 11 April 2012, Judge Page upheld the  respondent's  certification
    under s.55 of the 2006 Act.  Consequently, he dismissed the  appeal  on
    asylum and humanitarian protection grounds.  The focus  of  the  appeal
    was on the risk, if any, to the appellant on return under Arts 2 and  3
    of the ECHR.  Before the judge, the Secretary of  State  accepted  that
    the appellant would be at risk  in  his  home  area  of  Tripoli.   The
    central issue was  whether  the  appellant  could  internally  relocate
    within Libya.  The judge found that the appellant could  do  so  safely
    and so also dismissed the appeal under Arts 2 and 3 of the ECHR.

 5. The appellant sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on  the
    sole basis that the  judge  had  erred  in  law  in  finding  that  the
    appellant could internally relocate safely  within  Libya.   On  9  May
    2012, the First-tier Tribunal (Judge E B Grant) granted  the  appellant
    permission to appeal on the ground that it was arguable that the  judge
    had failed to engage with the background material dealing with the risk
    to suspected Gaddafi supporters in finding  that  the  appellant  could
    safely relocate to anywhere "away from his immediate locality where  he
    lived in Tripoli" and, in particular, to Benghazi.

 6. The appeal initially came before me on 30 October 2012.  In a  decision
    dated 8 November 2012, I concluded that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  had
    erred in law in reaching its finding that the  appellant  could  safely
    internally relocate within Libya.  It is unnecessary to repeat here  my
    reasons which are set out in  full  in  my  decision.   In  essence,  I
    concluded that the judge had failed to take into account the background
    evidence relevant to the appellant's risk on return  outside  his  home
    area in  Libya.   At  paras  21-22  of  my  decision  I  summarised  my
    conclusions as follows:

         "21. In my judgment, [the] background material was highly  relevant
         to the judge's assessment of the risk to the appellant outside  his
         home area of Tripoli on the basis of the case that he  was  putting
         forward at the hearing, namely that because of his tribe  he  would
         be perceived as anti-Gaddafi and that might put him at risk whether
         in itself or because it drew attention to him and there was a  risk
         that he would be connected with his brother  and  cousin's  actions
         and revenge sought by the militia.

         22. This point was simply not grasped by the judge  who  failed  to
         grapple with the background evidence in reaching his  finding  that
         the risk to the appellant was "fanciful"  outside  of  Tripoli  and
         further that he was safe in any other part of Libya, in  particular
         Benghazi.  I do not accept Mr Hibbs' submission that the background
         material, in effect, recognises Benghazi as a safe  haven.   As  Ms
         Knorr submitted, the  Amnesty  report  was,  in  part,  based  upon
         research carried out in Benghazi.  In my judgment, without  further
         exploration, it would be wholly wrong to interpret  the  widespread
         nature of the activities of the militia against those perceived  to
         be anti-Gaddafi to exclude Libya's second largest city.  Nothing in
         the Amnesty International report expressly excludes  Benghazi  and,
         given the research base included Benghazi, it  would  be  wrong  to
         infer necessarily that what is said in that report (and  which  was
         relevant to the appellant's claimed risk outside Tripoli)  did  not
         extend to Benghazi.  In any event, this was a matter  not  explored
         by the judge because he did not consider the background evidence at
         all."

 7. Consequently, I set aside the decision in order that the Upper Tribunal
    could, at a resumed hearing,  remake  the  decision.   The  appeal  was
    listed before me on 30 October 2012 in order to do so.

The Issues

 8. At the previous hearing, Mr Hibbs, who (then and now)  represented  the
    respondent, indicated that he might wish to revisit the concession made
    by the Presenting Officer  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  that  the
    appellant was at risk in his home area because of his  connection  with
    his brother and cousin.  In effect, that would have raised the issue of
    the appellant's credibility.  At the resumed hearing, Mr Hibbs did  not
    seek to reopen the issue of the appellant's credibility in general and,
    in particular, whether he was at  risk  in  his  home  area.   He  did,
    however, not accept the appellant was a member of the Mashashiya  tribe
    as he claimed.  Membership of that  tribe  (which  the  appellant  says
    supported the former regime headed by Colonel Gaddafi) is part  of  the
    factual matrix which he claims puts him at risk on return to Libya.

 9. Apart from that issue, there is no dispute about the relevant  personal
    facts to this appeal.  The issues I must decide are as follows:

      i) Has the appellant established that he is a member of the Mashashiya
         tribe?

     ii) Has the appellant established that outside his home area  in  Libya
         there is a real risk that  he  will  be  subject  to  serious  ill-
         treatment (or of being killed) by  militia  and/or  others  on  the
         basis that he faces identification as a  former  Gaddafi  supporter
         due to his tribe, surname and family links with the Gaddafi  regime
         including his family's work  with  the  internal  security  service
         under Gaddafi and that he had identified persons for them  involved
         in demonstrations so that they could be apprehended.

10. As the appellant's claim lies wholly under Arts 2 and 3  of  the  ECHR,
    the only issue is risk on return and no submissions were  made  on  the
    basis that, absent any risk, it would not  be  unreasonable  or  unduly
    harsh for him to live elsewhere in Libya.

Discussion and Findings

11. As I have indicated, with the  exception  of  the  appellant's  claimed
    tribe, the personal facts are accepted.  They are helpfully set out  in
    Ms Knorr's skeleton argument and were not disputed by Mr  Hibbs.   They
    are as follows:

      i) The appellant is a national of Libya who was born  on  30  December
         1990.  He is, therefore 22 years of age.

     ii) Prior to coming to the UK on 19 April 2011, the appellant lived  in
         Zansoor in Tripoli.   He  lived  with  his  family,  including  his
         parents.  The appellant's family was pro-Gaddafi.  The  appellant's
         family were financially well-off.  His father  worked  for  an  oil
         company and had five houses in Libya,  including  Zansoorr,  Yefran
         and Tripoli.

    iii) The appellant's brother, older sister and  cousin  worked  for  the
         Libyan Government.  The appellant's brother was head of a  team  in
         the intelligence section of the internal security services and  his
         job involved  collecting  information  on  those  who  opposed  the
         Government.  The appellant's cousin also  worked  in  the  internal
         security service of Colonel Gaddafi.  The appellant's sister was  a
         school teacher and worked for the Revolutionary Committees

     iv) In early 2011, the appellant attended protests  and  demonstrations
         in Zintan, Al Kala'a and Yefran  at the request of his brother  and
         took photographs and videos of people including persons  burning  a
         picture of Colonel Gaddafi.  He gathered  names  and  addresses  of
         individuals which he passed on to his brother.  As a result of  his
         actions, he believes, a number were detained and killed.

      v) The appellant's cousin was detained and killed by the rebels during
         the revolution.

     vi) The appellant's family home in Yefran was  burnt  down  during  the
         revolution.

    vii) The appellant believes that his brother is now living in Tunisia as
         he could not return safely to Libya having  been  involved  in  war
         crimes.  The appellant's sister has claimed asylum in this country.

12. In the course of the hearing and the representatives' oral and  written
    submissions, I was referred to a  number  of  background  documents  in
    relation to Libya.  For the appellant, these are contained  within  the
    original bundle  submitted  at  the  First-tier  Tribunal  ("app's  FtT
    bundle") and an additional bundle submitted  for  the  hearing  in  the
    Upper Tribunal ("app's UT bundle").  That latter  bundle  was  admitted
    under rule 15(2A) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
    (SI 2008/2698) without objection by Mr Hibbs.  That bundle includes two
    documents which featured large in the parties' submissions, namely,  an
    expert report from Mr Emile Joff� dated 3 December 2012 and  a  further
    letter from him dated 17 April 2013.  For the respondent, Mr Hibbs also
    referred me to two Country of Information Reports  on  Libya,  dated  7
    March 2012 and 19 December 2012.  In addition, I was  provided  with  a
    copy of the Operational Guidance Note for Libya dated 7 September 2012.
     A number of other background documents are also contained  within  the
    respondent's bundle although I was not  directly  referred  to  any  of
    those.

13. In reaching my findings in this appeal it is not possible  to  separate
    out precisely the material concerned with  the  factual  issue  of  the
    appellant's claimed membership of the Mashashiya tribe and the risk  to
    him, if any, on return.  In fact, it would be artificial to do so.   In
    particular,  Mr  Joff�'s  report,  as  will   become   clear   shortly,
    intertwines the two issues.

14. In his asylum interview on 18 May 2011 at question  12,  the  appellant
    says that, "Originally I am Amazige ethnicity,  Berber.   My  tribe  is
    Mushushi".  The reference to the tribe "Mushushi", it is accepted, is a
    reference  to  the  differently  spelled  tribe  referred  to  in   the
    background documents as "Mashashiya" and "Mshashiya".  In his statement
    submitted at the First-tier Tribunal the  appellant  says  at  para  24
    (page 1F of app's FtT bundle:  "The name of the  tribe  I  am  from  is
    called Yefran.  My surname  indicates  that  I  am  from  that  tribe."
    Because of the need for anonymity, I will refer to the appellant's name
    hereafter as "S".

15. The appellant then goes on to say that if he moved elsewhere in  Libya,
    his family name would inform others about which tribe he is  from.   In
    his statement dated 3 December 2012 submitted for  the  Upper  Tribunal
    hearing (page 75 of the app's UT bundle)  the  appellant  explains  his
    earlier evidence about his tribe and his name linking him to that tribe
    at paras 1-6:

         "1.  My name is [Z N S].  I am providing this statement to  further
             explain the issue of my tribe.

         2.   I am aware that my Appeal Statement which I signed on 26 March
             2012 stated at paragraph 24 that my tribe is Yefran.

         3.   In Libya, when we were asked about our tribe we can say Yefran
             or Mashashiya.  Everyone from my family originate from Yefran.
              There are other tribes that originate from  Yefran,  but  one
             thing that we all have in common is that we are all Berber.

         4.   When I stated that my tribe is Yefran, I did not think it  was
             important to make a distinction between Yefran and the precise
             name of my tribe.  I thought that by informing my adviser that
             my tribe is Yefran, it would be easier for her to research  my
             case because this place is easily identified  on  the  map  of
             Libya.  The Mashashiya tribe is the biggest tribe  in  Yefran.
             Yefran is also one of the biggest cities  in  the  mountainous
             region of Nafusa, and is located about 130-140 kilometres from
             Tripoli.

         5.   I wish to reiterate the information that I provided during  my
             asylum interview.  In response to Q.A  12,  I  responded  that
             originally I am of Amazighi ethnicity, and a Berber.  My tribe
             is Mashashiya (spelt Mushushi in the interview record).

         6.   My surname '[S]' will identify me as being from the Mashashiya
             tribe.  It will also identify me as being the family member of
             my brother and my cousin who  were  directly  responsible  for
             carrying out orders under the Gaddafi government.   I  believe
             that I will be immediately killed if I am returned  to  Libya,
             not directly because of my tribal affiliation, but because  of
             association with my brother and my cousin."

16. As part of her  submissions,  Ms  Knorr  relied  upon  the  appellant's
    evidence that he was from the Mashashiya tribe and that that tribe  was
    pro-Gaddafi.  His name would link him with that tribe and if  he  moved
    elsewhere it would become known that  he  was  from  that  tribe.   She
    relied upon the background evidence that, she  submitted,  demonstrated
    that members of that  tribe  were  at  risk  but,  in  this  case,  she
    submitted the appellant would personally be at risk  because  it  would
    draw attention to his history of his  family's  (and  indeed  his  own)
    involvement with the Gaddafi regime and put him directly at risk.   She
    relied in particular upon Mr Joff�'s report supporting the  appellant's
    claimed membership of the Mashashiya tribe, the association of his name
    with that tribe and the risk to which that would put him on return.

17. Mr Hibbs submitted that the appellant's claim to be  a  member  of  the
    Mashashiya tribe was not sustainable in the  light  of  the  background
    evidence, in particular he  also  relied  on  Mr  Joff�'s  report.   He
    submitted that the appellant  claimed  that  his  tribe  was  "Berber".
    First, he submitted, on the basis of the background material, that  the
    Berber tribes were not supporters of Gaddafi but rather were hated  and
    persecuted by him.  Secondly, he submitted that  the  Mashashiya  tribe
    was an "Arab" tribe rather than a Berber tribe  and  this  contradicted
    the appellant's claim that his tribe - the Mashashiya  -  were  Berber.
    He submitted that I should not accept the appellant's  evidence  as  to
    his tribe and, if I did, in any event that would not put him at risk as
    being a pro-Gaddafi tribe.

18. Despite his sustained and carefully crafted arguments, I do not  accept
    Mr Hibbs' submissions.  Mr  Joff�'s  report  is  a  very  detailed  one
    running to over 70 pages.  It sets out,  in  considerable  detail,  the
    political history including the tribal allegiances  within  Libya.   Mr
    Joff� is a recognised expert and Mr  Hibbs  did  not  argue  otherwise;
    indeed, as I have said, he relied in part upon Mr Joff�'s  report.   It
    is difficult in a judgment to do justice to the extensive  learning  of
    Mr Joff�'s report.

19. The appellant explains in  his  most  recent  statement  that  when  he
    described his tribe as "Yefran", he did so only because  that  was  the
    easiest way of describing where he had come from in Libya.  Yefran  is,
    in fact, a town where the Mashashiya tribe lives as a result  of  being
    "rewarded with access to confiscated land around Yffren" because it was
    "loyal to the [Gaddafi] regime" (see para 205 of Mr Joff�'s report).

20. Mr Hibbs relied upon Mr Joff�'s report, in particular paras  135,  139-
    141.  These paragraphs, Mr Hibbs submitted, established that  those  of
    "Amazigh" ethnicity  -  which  the  appellant  claimed  to  be  -  were
    "Berber".  Mr Hibbs submitted that the Berber tribe were, in the  words
    of Mr Joff� at para 31, "profoundly disliked" by  the  Gaddafi  regime.
    If, therefore, the appellant claimed to be Berber, the appellant was  a
    member of a tribe which  was  not  pro-Gaddafi,  rather  it  was  anti-
    Gaddafi.

21. In my view, this argument cannot be  sustained  on  the  basis  of  the
    background material including Mr Joff�'s expert report.   It  is  quite
    clear  from  Mr  Joff�'s   report   that   the   "crucial   tribe-state
    interrelations" are "complex" (see para  202  of  Mr  Joff�'s  report).
    What Mr Joff�'s report shows at paras 203 et seq is that the Mashashiya
    tribe is "Berber in origin".  Its name, however, is derived from Arabic
    "despite the tribe's claimed Berber origins".  That latter  phrase,  of
    course, reflects the appellant's  evidence.   He  claims  that  it  has
    Berber origins.  However, despite its Berber  origin  and  despite  the
    fact that in general the  Berber  tribes  were  anti-Gaddafi  and  were
    treated as such by that regime, the Mashashiya tribe were a tribe  that
    was, in the words of Mr Joff�, "seen  to  be  loyal  to  the  [Gaddafi]
    regime" (see para 205 of his report).   That  is  consistent  with  the
    appellant's evidence of his own family's  position  under  the  Gaddafi
    regime.  His brother and cousin were  part  of  the  internal  security
    services and his family were  clearly  affluent,  owning  a  number  of
    houses in Libya.

22. Mr Hibbs referred me to the two COI Reports of  7  March  2012  and  19
    December 2012.  As regards the 7 March 2012 report, neither  refers  to
    Mashashiya under the heading "The Main Arab Tribes of Libya"  or  under
    the heading "The Berber Tribal Groups of Libya" at para 19.04 and 19.05
    respectively.  At paras 19.20 and 19.21,  however,  under  the  heading
    "Mesheshiya" (another spelling of the appellant's claimed  tribe),  the
    March 2012 COI Report identified the Mashashiya as  being  "accused  of
    past loyalty to Gaddafi" and which Gaddafi "imported to  the  area  [of
    Zintan] decades ago" as being  forced  out  of  their  homes  and  area
    because of their past loyalty:

         "19.20    Npr radio in a bulletin of  9  November,  2011  In  Post-
             Gaddafi Libya, Enmities Continue To Smoulder, reported on  the
             Mushashya in the Nafusa mountains:

                  'In Libya's Nafusa mountains  southwest  of  Tripoli,  the
                  sight of abandoned villages and idle fighters hanging onto
                  their weapons gives bleak testament to the fact  that  not
                  everyone in the country is ready  for  the  violence  that
                  overthrew former dictator Moammar Gaddafi to end ...

                  'The village [outside the  city  of  Zintan]  used  to  be
                  populated by members of a nomadic  southern  tribe  called
                  the Mushashya whom Gaddafi imported to  the  area  decades
                  ago.

                  'Now, a sign in the town bears a handwritten  scrawl  that
                  says, 'Mushashya:  Gaddafi  dogs.'   Local  residents  are
                  hoping the pro-Gaddafi families who were driven out  don't
                  come back...

                  'Matoug Merdassi, an  anti-Gaddafi  fighter  from  Zintan,
                  says the Mushashya families can never  come  back  because
                  when Zintan rose up against the dictator, they joined with
                  the loyalist forces against their neighbours.

                  'Massoud al-Keesh, 55, says that when the uprising  began,
                  Mushashya people gave the village to the army, which  used
                  it to rocket and shell Zintan and the surrounding towns.'

         19.21    The Human Rights Watch World Report 2012 - Libya, released
             on 22  January  2012  and  covering  events  of  2011,  noted,
             'Members of the Mesheshiya tribe  in  the  western  mountains,
             accused of past loyalty to Gaddafi, also  reported  harassment
             and revenge attacks."

23. Those passages are entirely consistent with,  and  supportive  of,  the
    appellant's claim that his tribe, the Mashashiya, are perceived as pro-
    Gaddafi despite his claim that the tribe has Berber  origins  and  that
    there is widespread violent targeting of them (and other pro-Gaddafi).

24. Turning to the December 2012 COI Report, again, no  specific  reference
    is made of the Mashashiya tribe in the catalogue of tribes set  out  at
    section 19 headed "Ethnic Groups".  However, at para 19.10  the  report
    refers to the tribes from Zintan as having "targeted Mashashiya  towns,
    perceived as loyalist".   That  it,  of  course,  consistent  with  the
    appellant's claim that his family home in Yefran was burned down.   The
    report then goes on to identify ill-treatment of  Mashashiya  detainees
    in the following terms:

         "The [International Commission of  Enquiry]  was  able  to  confirm
         reports that Mashashiya detainees have been tortured, towns looted,
         and property burnt.  Mashashiyans who have attempted to  return  to
         their homes have reportedly been beaten.  In December 2011, Zintani
         thuwar reportedly shelled a town containing Mashashiya  IDPs.   The
         Military Council twice refused to allow the Commission to enter one
         of the towns.   Nonetheless,  damage  was  visible.   Graffiti  was
         written on  the  town  signs,  including  'Mashashiya  -  Qadhafi's
         dogs'."

25. At para 19.11,  the  COI  Report  goes  on  to  refer  further  to  the
    International Commission of Enquiry and states that:   "The  Commission
    finds that Zintan Thuwar have killed, arbitrarily arrested and tortured
    members of the Mashashiyan community ...".

26. In my judgment, those  extracts  from  the  COI  Reports  are  entirely
    supportive of the appellant's claim to  be  member  of  the  Mashashiya
    tribe which, although Berber in origins, was  one  that  supported  the
    Gaddafi regime and, has as a result  since  that  regime's  fall,  been
    subject to retribution in the form of torture, loss of  lands  and  its
    members being killed.

27. That is further supported by the Amnesty International Report entitled,
    "Militias Threaten Hopes for New Libya" dated  16  February  2012  (see
    pages 5-30 of the app's FtT bundle).  At page 12 of that  report  (page
    16 of the app's FtT  bundle)  the  report  refers  to  members  of  the
    Mashashyia clan (spelt in the report as "Mshashiya") as being  targeted
    by militia for their alleged  support  of  Gaddafi  forces  during  the
    revolution.  The report is as follows:

         "DETAINEES OF MSHASHIYA ORIGIN

         Members of the Mshashiya and from Qawalish  tribes  in  the  Nafusa
         Mountain area have similarly been targeted by militias  because  of
         their alleged support for al-Gaddafi forces  during  the  conflict.
         People  from  the  Mshashiya  tribe  and   Qawalish   village   are
         particularly targeted by militias from Zintan.

         B11 is a 20-year-old soldier  who  originates  from  the  Mshashiya
         region  but  lives  with  his   parents   in   Tripoli.     Amnesty
         International saw him in January 2012 soon after his  release  from
         detention when  he  was  being  treated  in  hospital  for  torture
         injuries and was hardly able to talk.  His elder brother reported:

             'On 16 January in the evening about  10  armed  men  with  two
             vehicles - apparently from a militia from Zintan - came to our
             family house Tripoli.  The armed men did not  show  an  arrest
             warrant.   There  was  a  man  accompanying  them   [who   was
             apparently related to one of the militia men] and  he  accused
             my brother of having pulled a knife on him in an incident that
             occurred about seven months  ago  and  in  which  no  one  was
             injured.  The armed men took my brother away.  The next day my
             father and I looked everywhere for my brother and were finally
             able to collect him from a detention centre near  the  Tripoli
             International Airport.  After his release my brother  told  me
             that he was initially taken to a farm near the  airport  where
             he was abused.  He said he was tied  to  a  post  and  beaten,
             including on his back, legs and genitals.  The armed  men  who
             abused him were apparently the same who had taken him from the
             house.'"

28. Further, that report at page 4 (page 8 of the app's FtT bundle)  states
    that:

         "Similarly, thousands of people have been  evicted  or  fled  their
         homes in the Nafusa Mountains, mainly people from the Mshashiya and
         Qawalish tribes, as well as in Sirte  and  Bani  Walid  and  remain
         targeted by militias because  of  their  alleged  support  for  al-
         Gaddafi forces during the conflict."

29. The threat to the Mashashiya is also referred to in  the  Human  Rights
    Watch "World Report 2012: Libya" dated 22 January 2012 (at pages  53-56
    of the app's FtT bundle).  At page 3 of that report  (page  55  of  the
    app's FtT bundle) it is stated that:

         "Members of the Mesheshiya tribe in the western mountains,  accused
         of past loyalty to Gaddafi, also reported  harassment  and  revenge
         attacks."

30. The Amnesty International Report goes  on  to  deal  with  "'Outsiders'
    Targeted" and states that (at page 23 of the app's FtT bundle):

         "In al-Zawiya, a town that also saw violent confrontations  between
         supporters of the uprising and al-Gaddafi forces, hardened feelings
         against those who are known to have  or  are  suspected  of  having
         supported the former regime and its forces have  also  resulted  in
         revenge attacks and reprisals by local militias."

31. In short, the background material refers  to  widespread  targeting  of
    those perceived to be pro-Gaddafi  (including  the  Mashishya)  and  to
    their detention and ill-treatment by militia.

32. Mr Joff� sums up the position in para 215 of his report as follows:

         "(215)   [The appellant's] claims must, therefore, be  set  against
             this complex tribal  background,  in  which  there  have  been
             longstanding animosities  between  his  tribal  community  and
             surrounding tribes, some Arab (Zintan) and some  Berber.   His
             tribal group was committed to the Qadhafi regime  as  well,  a
             position it has manifested even after the  regime  itself  had
             been defeated and destroyed.  In a similar manner, the  proven
             loyalty of his family  to  the  regime  would  certainly  have
             facilitated family members being inculcated into the  security
             organisations and services of the Qadhafi  regime.   In  these
             circumstances, the position he adopted  in  February  2011  is
             best  explained  as  a  consequence  of  the  intrinsic  group
             loyalties of which he was a part, which would not have allowed
             him to act other than he did.  In short, his tribal ethos  was
             a major factor in encouraging him into the stance towards  the
             revolution in Libya and towards those who sympathised with its
             aims that he adopted."

33. Mr Hibbs submitted that the appellant's surname was not consistent with
    his claimed tribal origin.  He referred me to a Middle East News report
    dated October 12 2011 where a council member from Yefran described as a
    "predominantly Berber town" with the surname "A-S"  clearly  identifies
    himself as anti-Gaddafi.  That, in itself, is not sufficient to suggest
    to me that the appellant's name is inconsistent with his claimed tribal
    background.  At para 15 of his report, Mr Joff�,  although  he  is  not
    explicit about it,  refers  to  the  impracticality  of  the  appellant
    relocating in Libya for two reasons, one of which is that "surnames  in
    Libya, as Mr [S] suggests, often identify tribal origins".  There is no
    suggestion that the appellant's name is inconsistent with him  being  a
    member of the Mashashiya tribe.

34. On the basis of this material, I find that the appellant is a member of
    the Mashashiya tribe.  Although that tribe has Berber  origins  and  in
    general Berber tribes were  and  are  perceived  as  anti-Gaddafi,  the
    appellant's tribe was one that was favoured by the Gaddafi  regime  and
    aligned with it.  The tribe gained lands and other social and  economic
    benefits entirely consistent with the appellant's family's position  in
    Libya before the fall of the Gaddafi regime.  I find  that  members  of
    the Mashashiya tribe are perceived as pro-Gaddafi.

35. In the light of that  finding,  what,  if  any,  is  the  risk  to  the
    appellant on return to Libya.  I have  already  set  out  some  of  the
    background  material  showing  the  serious  ill-treatment   of   those
    perceived as pro-Gaddafi, including members of  the  Mashashiya  tribe.
    In this appeal, Ms Knorr submits that if the appellant relocates within
    Libya, both his tribal origins (in part because of his  name)  and  his
    family's involvement with the Gaddafi regime and  the  appellant's  own
    involvement with the Gaddafi regime will eventually emerge  and,  as  a
    consequence, he will be subject to treatment contrary  to  Art  3  and,
    possibly, Art 2 of the ECHR by anti-Gaddafi militia.  Ms  Knorr  relied
    upon Mr Joff�'s report, in particular his conclusions at para  216  but
    also his letter dated 17 April 2013.   She  submitted  that  the  anti-
    Gaddafi militia were widespread throughout Libya and the government was
    unable to provide a sufficiency of protection.   She  relied  upon,  in
    particular, paragraphs  79-80,  87  and  110.  At  para  110  she  drew
    attention to Mr Joff�'s view that the  "Zintan  and  Misurata  militias
    remain as  effectively  independent  powers  within  the  state".   The
    background material demonstrated, she submitted, that the Zintan were a
    major militia in Libya and that they targeted  pro-Gaddafi  individuals
    including members of the Mashashiya tribe.

36. Ms Knorr, in her skeleton argument, referred me to background documents
    in the appellant's FtT bundle at pages 2-3, 6-8, 14, 21,  23,  26,  36,
    39, 41, 47, 53, 55, 56, and the appellant's Upper  Tribunal  bundle  at
    78, 88, 91, 121.  She submitted that there was extensive evidence  that
    suspected Gaddafi loyalists are targeted by  the  militia  who  operate
    with impunity in Libya.  Further, there  was  extensive  evidence,  she
    submitted, that  members  of  the  Mashashiya  tribe  are  specifically
    targeted, referring to the appellant's FtT bundle at pages 8,  16,  22-
    23, 37, 38, 55.  Finally, she referred me to para 3.7.15  of  the  Home
    Office's Operational Guidance Note for Libya  dated  7  September  2012
    which stated that:

         "... given that those perceived to be  supporters  of  the  Gaddafi
         regime  cannot  access  effective  protection  from   the   interim
         government and that torture is  being  carried  out  by  officially
         recognised military and security entities, it is  unlikely  that  a
         claimant of this profile will be able  to  internally  relocate  in
         order to escape the risk of persecution."

37. The reference to "a claimant of this profile"  is  to  "perceived  Col.
    Gaddafi supporters and fighters" (see para 3.7.13).

38. Ms Knorr submitted that, to the extent it was  suggested  by  Mr  Hibbs
    that the appellant could relocate to Benghazi, there was nothing in the
    evidence to suggest that the reach of  the  militia  and  risk  to  the
    appellant did not extend there.

39. I begin with Mr Joff�'s conclusions  in  his  report  at  para  216  as
    follows:

         "(216)   I am now in a position to respond  to  specific  questions
             that have been put to me.  These cover issues of the  risk  of
             return,  sufficiency  of  protection  and   possibilities   of
             internal relocation.  I also comment on how knowledge of  [the
             appellant's]   participation  in   the   February   17,   2011
             demonstration might have become  public  knowledge  in  Libya.
             Quite apart from [the  appellant's]  specific  involvement  in
             events of the Jabal Nafusa, there are many generic  risks  and
             risks associated with social status  throughout  the  country.
             These have persisted and have shown little hope of improvement
             since the end of the civil war in late October 2011.

             (a)  There are undoubted  risks  upon  return  to  Libya.   As
                  described above, security at present is highly  fragmented
                  and individual  security  dependent  on  purely  arbitrary
                  behaviour from the many militia that still operate  there.
                  Even  formations  ostensibly  under   government   control
                  actually  operate  with  their  own  separate  chains   of
                  command,  even  if  their  formal  commanders   are   army
                  officers.  There  is  still  no  proper  process  of  law,
                  despite attempts to render the courts independent  of  the
                  state, and detention services are  still  largely  in  the
                  hands  of  independent  militias.   A  person  accused  of
                  support  for  the   former   regime   cannot,   therefore,
                  anticipate objective treatment by  the  Libyan  state,  in
                  accordance with due process of law.

             (b)  Nor  can  the  Libyan  state  provide  a  sufficiency  of
                  protection to persons accused  of  political  or  criminal
                  offences linked to the previous regime.  It  simply  lacks
                  the forces by which this could  be  done  and,  until  the
                  security  conundrum  is  resolved,  this  situation   will
                  persist.  It is difficult,  from  the  anodyne  statements
                  made by officials in  Tripoli,  to  judge  just  how  poor
                  security in  Libya  really  is.   However,  the  continued
                  existence of over 350 militias and of militias  ostensibly
                  disbanded, such as Ansar ash-Shari'a and Ansar  ed-Dine  -
                  both with links to al-Qa'ida - is evidence enough  of  the
                  real state of security inside the country.

             (c)  Internal relocation is, in theory, possible.  However, it
                  should be noted that Libya  essentially  consists  of  two
                  urban complexes and a rural hinterland which is  currently
                  highly unstable.  In the urban complexes  of  Tripoli  and
                  Benghazi considerable damage was done to housing, so there
                  is now a housing shortage and there are major problems  of
                  distribution of food  and  goods.   So  there  are  severe
                  practical problems of relocation,  quite  apart  from  the
                  arbitrary behaviour  of  the  militias.   In  general,  in
                  practice, relocation is not  a  viable  option  unless  an
                  individual has family located at the  site  of  relocation
                  which can help in an individual's or  family's  relocation
                  process.  By definition, in [the appellant's]  case,  this
                  will be virtually impossible  because  of  the  suspicions
                  levelled  against  the  Mashashiyya   and   against   [the
                  appellant's] family for their past links with the  Qadhafi
                  regime.  Burglary is a growing threat in all urban centres
                  and,  in   the   hinterland,   robbery,   carjacking   and
                  indiscriminate killings are constant threats,  to  such  a
                  degree that Fezzan has been placed under martial law.

             (d)  [The appellant's] role in identifying ringleaders amongst
                  the demonstrators in the Djabal Nafusa will have been very
                  easily established  by  demonstrators  and  rebels  alike.
                  Firstly,  his  family  was  well-known  in   the   region,
                  secondly, it  was  well-known  as  sympathising  with  the
                  Qadhafi  regime,  according  to  [the   appellant's]   own
                  statements.  Thirdly, his brother  and  cousin  were  also
                  known to have been involved in  the  security  services  -
                  indeed, his cousin appears to have  been  killed  in  this
                  connection subsequent  to  [the  appellant's]  activities.
                  Fourthly, [the appellant's] tribe,  the  Mashashiyya,  was
                  also known as being supporters of the Qadhafi regime.   In
                  such  circumstances,  the   arrest   of   ringleaders   in
                  demonstrations in which [the appellant] was known to  have
                  taken  part  would  have  been  bound  to  have  attracted
                  suspicions towards him as a source of information that had
                  led to the arrests.  It seems to me that, irrespective  of
                  [the appellant's] own volitions, he would  have  suspected
                  of betraying those known to be opposed  to  his  interests
                  and beliefs on those grounds alone."

40. Although, as Mr Hibbs pointed out, Mr Joff� states at para 216(d)  that
    internal relocation is "in theory possible" for the appellant, Mr Joff�
    gives, in my judgment, convincing reasons as to how it is  likely  that
    the appellant's background, which puts him at risk from militia opposed
    to Gaddafi, might surface.

41. Mr Joff� also records the inability of the Libyan government to control
    and provide  a  sufficiency  of  protection  against  the  "independent
    militias".  That latter point reflects what Mr Joff� says at  para  110
    that militia, such as the Zintan, are "effectively independent powers".



42. At para 15 Mr Joff� refers to the  militia  from  the  area  of  "Jabal
    Nafusa" which includes the town  of  Yefran  and  where  the  appellant
    assisted his brother by photographing and establishing the addresses of
    demonstrators.  There,  Mr  Joff�  comments  that  those  militia  are:
    "widespread throughout Libya, given the highly fragmented nature of the
    security situation in Libya".  In that paragraph, Mr Joff� goes  on  to
    state:

         "Even if he were to avoid direct contact with the  militias,  other
         security representatives might well recognise his origins from  his
         name and therefore treat him as hostile, irrespective of  what  his
         personal activities might have involved."

43. Mr Joff� returned to the potential risks, if any, to the appellant,  as
    a former regime loyalist or member  of  the  Mashashiya  tribe  in  his
    letter dated 17 April 2013.  There, he refers to the  "ample  evidence"
    of attacks on tribal members, particularly members of tribes linked  to
    the former regime and also to the inability of the Libyan government to
    control or dismantle the militia.  Mr Joff� said this:

         "... whilst there is ample evidence of  attacks  on  former  regime
         loyalists, identifying attacks on members of a particular tribe  is
         far more difficult because reports of such attacks normally do  not
         mention tribal affiliation.

         However, having said that, there is also ample evidence of  attacks
         on certain tribal members, particular the members of tribes  linked
         to the  former  regime  -  the  Qadhadhfa,  the  Warfalla  and  the
         Maghraha.  The same has been true of  tribes  known  to  have  been
         particularly loyal to the regime - the Touareg (who  were  expelled
         from Ghadames for allegedly forming part of the  regime's  forces).
         The Tawargha (who have been expelled and brutalized  from  Tawargha
         in their tens of thousands by the Misurata  militia  for  the  same
         reason, an expulsion that has attracted the attention of the United
         Nations, the Warshafanna, now victimized by the Zuwara militia  and
         the Mashashiyya who have been particularly targeted by  the  Zintan
         militia.  I cite below a typical case from a recent report  by  the

         The citation forms a footnote (No:  92)  to  the  main  report  and
         relates to a comment in the main body of the text  on  page  22  as
         follows:

             ...a core problem plaguing the judicial system is the  virtual
             collapse of the state security apparatus  and  the  widespread
             availability of weapons.  Armed groups that emerged victorious
             simultaneously took  on  the  roles  of  police,  prosecutors,
             judges and jailers.  Armed brigades set up  investigation  and
             arrest   units;   drafted   lists   of   'wanted'   (matlubin)
             individuals; set up checkpoints or forced their way into homes
             to capture presumed outlaws or people suspected of aiding  the
             former regime; and, in some cases,  ran  their  own  detention
             facilities.

                  In implementing their  policy,  the  armed  brigades  went
             after a large number of suspects.  The mere possession of pro-
             Qadhafi songs or photographs saved on a mobile telephone often
             justified immediate detention, as did hailing from a  town  or
             community accused of siding with  Qadhafi  forces  during  the
             war.

         That citation would seem to respond to  your  client's  generalized
         fears very precisely and reflects the current situation  in  Libya,
         even though many of the specific examples it  cites  refer  tot  he
         recent past.  The Libyan government, as  I  explained  in  my  main
         report, is still quite incapable of controlling or dismantling  the
         militias and the militias are still the main force  using  violence
         or the threat of violence to ensure public order and  to  mete  out
         their own variant of 'justice'.  Even the bodies that it claims  to
         control, such as the Supreme Security Committee forces,  which  are
         operated under the aegis of the Ministry of the Interior  to  carry
         out the responsibilities  of  the  police,  or  the  Libyan  Shield
         forces, in theory under the control of the Ministry of  Defence  to
         collaborate with the Libyan army, are actually made up of the major
         militias which  -  in  reality  -  respond  to  their  own  command
         structures and not those of the Libyan government.  The  result  is
         hundreds of people from  for  instance,  Bani  Walid,  detained  in
         Misurata simply because they were members of the Warfalla (footnote
         91 in the ICG report cited above).

         More striking, as far as your client is concerned  is  the  account
         contained in footnote 92 to this report, which I quote  in  extenso
         below:

             Emhamed Ali Mohammed Elaheemer, an elderly man of the Mashasha
             tribe, which has a long  history  of  communal  tensions  with
             Zintan, said that his  son,  Fathi,  was  killed  after  being
             tortured in captivity at the end of 2011.  His story is a rare
             insider's account of torture in detention.   Fathi  reportedly
             disappeared on 5 October 2011, and two days  later  armed  men
             showed up at his  Tripoli  home  demanding  that  his  brother
             Youssef follow  them  back  to  their  headquarters.   Youssef
             complied and discovered that Fathi, who had been  abducted  on
             his  way  home,  also  was  being  held   at   the   brigade's
             headquarters.  'Youssef  said  that  they  gave  him  electric
             shocks and that later Fathi was brought in and tortured  there
             in front of him in order to force Youssef to reveal the  names
             and addresses of his  brother's  friends,'  the  father  said.
             Since Youssef said nothing, 'they took Fathi outside the  room
             and threatened him with something other than beating, and when
             they brought him back in the room, Fathi  started  to  confess
             without even waiting for the questions to be  over.'   Youssef
             was released but they heard nothing about Fathi for days.  '50
             days after his arrest we found him dead in  Tripoli's  central
             hospital.  All over his body were signs of  torture'.   Crisis
             Group interview, Emhamed Ali Mohammed  Elaheemer,  Sghegha  12
             July 2012.

         There is, in effect, abundant evidence  of  the  victimization  and
         persecution of groups alleged to have supported the Qadhafi regime.
          Human Rights Watch, for instance, published a major press  release
         on the case of Tawargha as recently as March 20, 2013 in which  the
         organisation   called   for   United   Nations   Security   Council
         intervention  after  the  chief  prosecutor  of  the  International
         Criminal Court warned the Council in her last  report  in  November
         2012 that the treatment of the population of the town might  amount
         to collective punishment and  warrant  a  reference  to  the  Court
         itself.  It seems to me that, in the light of  the  material  cited
         above and the copious  evidence  now  generally  available  of  the
         increasing victimization of supporters of the former  regime,  your
         client has legitimate concerns about his safety  upon  return.   It
         might finally be noted that Libya's General National Congress - the
         country's interim parliament, is currently discussing a  law  which
         it is very likely to pass, which  would  exclude  from  all  public
         function anybody who had had formal or informal engagement with the
         former regime.   The  Personal  Isolation  Law  is,  in  effect,  a
         draconian piece of legislation that will exclude tens of  thousands
         of Libyans from public life in the future."

44. In reaching my finding I also bear in mind the  background  material  I
    referred to earlier  in  relation  to  the  Mashashiya  tribe.   In  my
    judgment,  the  background  evidence  establishes  a  high   level   of
    insecurity in Libya.  It also establishes the free range which the anti-
    Gaddafi militia have in Libya which is beyond the control of the Libyan
    government.  As the Amnesty  International  document  entitled  "Libya:
    'out  of  control'  militias  commit  widespread  abuses  a  year  from
    uprising" dated 16 February 2012 (at  page  2  of  app's  FtT  bundle):
    "armed militias operating across Libya commit widespread  human  rights
    abuses with impunity, fuelling insecurity and hindering the  rebuilding
    of  state  institutions  ..."  That  report  refers  to   the   militia
    committing, "widespread  and  serious  abuses,  including  war  crimes"
    against "suspected Al-Gaddafi loyalists, with  cases  of  people  being
    unlawfully detained and tortured - sometimes to death."

45. It is unnecessary  to  cite  further  like  material  to  which  I  was
    referred.  I have already earlier in this  determination,  referred  to
    background material showing the targeting of  Mashashiya  because  they
    are perceived as pro-Gaddafi (see in addition,  Amnesty  International,
    "Militias Threaten Hopes for New Libya" dated 16 February 2012 at pages
    16 and 22-23 of the app's FtT bundle).  That is, in reality, a facet of
    the risk faced by all those perceived as pro-Gaddafi.

46. In my judgment, if the appellant is returned to Libya there is  a  real
    risk that outside his home area that through his name or  otherwise  by
    enquiry his tribal background will become known.  The appellant  cannot
    be expected to lie about his background (see HJ (Iran) [2010] UKSC 31).



47. The background evidence demonstrates  the  widespread  reach  of  anti-
    Gaddafi militia and  that  they  commit  serious  human  rights  abuses
    including torture, detention and killing of those who are perceived  as
    pro-Gaddafi.

48. I reject the submission  that  Benghazi  is  a  safe  haven  for  those
    perceived as pro-Gaddafi.  Mr Hibbs  recognised,  in  his  submissions,
    that any suggestion  that  Benghazi  was  a  safe  place  was  not  his
    strongest point.  The evidence does  not  support  any  differentiation
    between Benghazi and other areas outside  Tripoli.   Repeating  what  I
    said in my earlier decision, the Amnesty International Report (at  pp2-
    30 of the app's FtT bundle), to which I referred  above,  was  in  part
    based upon research carried out in Benghazi (see page 9  of  the  app's
    FtT bundle). The widespread reach of the anti-Gaddafi militia does  not
    exclude Benghazi.

49. There is a real risk that the appellant's family and  his  own  history
    will be discovered.  There is a real risk that he will be perceived  as
    a pro-Gaddafi supporter (which of course  he  was)  by  virtue  of  his
    tribal and family background.  There is a real risk that his  (and  his
    family's) involvement with the Gaddafi  regime  (which  the  respondent
    classifies as amounting to 'war  crimes')  will  become  known.   There
    will, as a consequence, be a real risk of serious harm to the appellant
    or even his death att he hands of anti-Gaddafi militia.

50. Further, the background documents and Mr Joff�'s report  establish,  in
    my  judgment,  that  these  militia  are,  in  effect,  "a   law   unto
    themselves".  In my  judgment,  the  Libyan  government  is  unable  or
    unwilling to control them and provide those who would be at  risk  from
    them with a "sufficiency of protection" as  required  by  international
    law (see Art 7 of the Qualification Directive and Horvath v SSHD [2001]
    1 AC 489).  The latter is, in fact, expressly recognised in the  UKBA's
    own Operational Guidance Note dated 7 September  2012  at  para  3.7.15
    which I set out above.

51. Given the appellant's tribal and personal profile and given the risk of
    that being identified, I am satisfied that on return to Libya, not only
    in his home area but throughout Libya, there is a  real  risk  that  he
    would be subject to serious ill-treatment contrary to Art 3 of the ECHR
    or a real risk of being killed contrary to Art 2 of the ECHR.

52. For these reasons, the appeal is allowed under Arts  2  and  3  of  the
    ECHR.

Decision

53. The First-tier Tribunal's decision to dismiss the appellant's appeal on
    asylum and humanitarian protection grounds stands.

54. The First-tier Tribunal's decision to dismiss  the  appellant's  appeal
    under Arts 2 and 3 of the ECHR involved the making of an error of  law.
    That decision cannot stand and is set aside.

55. I remake the decision allowing the appellant's appeal under Arts 2  and
    3 of the ECHR.
