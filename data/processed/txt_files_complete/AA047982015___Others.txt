Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Greer (Legal Representative)
For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. The Appellants are citizens of Yemen. On May 30, 2014  they  entered
       the United Kingdom as visitors. On June 3,  2014  they  applied  for
       asylum. The respondent refused their asylum claims on  February  26,
       2015 under paragraph 336 HC 395.

    2. The appellants appealed those decisions under section 82(1)  of  the
       Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 on March 19, 2015.

    3. Their appeals came before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  Chambers
       (hereinafter referred to as the Judge) on May  10,  2016  and  in  a
       decision promulgated on May 18, 2016 he dismissed their  appeals  on
       all grounds.

    4. The appellants lodged grounds of appeal on June 1,  2016  submitting
       the Judge had erred in the way he dealt with article 15(c).

    5. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal
       Nightingale on June 13, 2016 who found it was arguable the Judge had
       erred in his consideration of the evidence. The matter  came  before
       me on September 8, 2016 and having heard submissions I  found  there
       had been an error of law in relation to the  issue  of  humanitarian
       protection.

    6. Both representatives agreed that the case required  further  country
       evidence as the situation in Yemen was changing all the time.

    7. No anonymity direction has been made.

SUBMISSIONS

    8. Mr McVeety acknowledged the situation in Yemen was not good at  this
       current time. The  respondent's  own  policy  guidance  acknowledges
       there are  large  parts  of  Yemen  where  return  would  place  the
       appellant at risk of indiscriminate violence. However, article 15(c)
       is a high barrier to reach as evidenced by the fact the situation in
       Afghanistan did not reach the necessary level. He accepted it may be
       arguable that a return would breach article 3 ECHR but ultimately it
       would be a matter for the Tribunal.

    9. Mr Greer submitted that returning the appellants would place them at
       risk of serious violence or indiscriminate violence. The  respondent
       acknowledged in her latest  guidance  that  in  considering  risk  a
       caseworker had to have regard to the latest country  situation.  The
       appellant's  latest  bundle   confirms   that   the   position   has
       deteriorated and whilst  Aden  was  currently  unoccupied  by  Daesh
       forces it was being bombed on a daily basis and the fact 80% of  the
       country was occupied would suggest that it would only be a matter of
       time before Aden would be taken over by Daesh. He invited me to find
       the appellants would be at risk.

DISCUSSION AND FINDINGS

   10. This hearing was about whether the appellants, former  residents  of
       Aden, would be at risk of either indiscriminate violence or  serious
       harm.

   11. Paragraph  339C  (iii)  confirms  that  a  person  will  be  granted
       humanitarian protection if he faces a risk of serious  harm  and  is
       unable or, owing to such risk, unwilling to  avail  himself  of  the
       protection of the country. Serious harm is defined as

        a. The death penalty or execution.
        b. Unlawful killing.
        c. Torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.
        d. Serious and individual threat to a civilian's life by reason  of
           indiscriminate  violence  in  situations  of  international   or
           internal armed conflict.

   12. Article 15(c) of Council Directive  2004/83/EC  ("the  Qualification
       Directive") defines serious harm within the Directive as:

           "serious and individual threat to a civilian's life or person by
           reason of indiscriminate violence in situations of international
           or internal armed conflict."

   13. The Court of Justice of the European Union ("CJEU") gave judgment in
       Diakitï¿½ (Case C-285/12) in which it was held that:

           "on a proper construction of Article 15(c) of Directive 2004/83,
           it must be acknowledged that an internal armed conflict  exists,
           for the purposes of applying that provision, if a State's  armed
           forces confront one or more armed groups or if two or more armed
           groups confront  each  other.  It  is  not  necessary  for  that
           conflict  to  be  categorised  as  'armed  conflict  not  of  an
           international character' under international  humanitarian  law;
           nor is it necessary to carry out, in addition to an appraisal of
           the level of violence present  in  the  territory  concerned,  a
           separate   assessment   of   the   intensity   of   the    armed
           confrontations, the level of organisation of  the  armed  forces
           involved or the duration of the conflict."

   14. The CJEU has highlighted  the  'exceptional  situation'  needed  for
       Article 15(c) to  apply  to  civilians  generally.  In  Elgafaji  v.
       Staatssecretaris van Justitie, C-465/07 at paragraph 37, the  Court
       made clear that, for this to be the case-

             '[...] the degree of  indiscriminate  violence  characterising
             the armed conflict taking place ... [must reach] such  a  high
             level that substantial grounds are shown for believing that  a
             civilian, returned to the relevant country or, as the case may
             be, to the relevant region, would, solely on  account  of  his
             presence on the territory of that country or  region,  face  a
             real risk of being subject to the serious threat  referred  in
             Article 15(c) of the Directive.'


   15. The level of violence has to be assessed by its quantity as well  as
       by its quality. There can be no doubt that a substantial quantity of
       violence is a necessity without which  subsidiary  protection  shall
       not be granted. However, defining the threshold of Article 15(c)  is
       not a simple matter of analysing quantitative data. Three principles
       govern this assessment:

        a. First, the approach must be holistic and inclusive.  Courts  and
           Tribunals must take  into  account  a  wide  range  of  relevant
           variables.


        b. Second, Courts and Tribunals should not limit  themselves  to  a
           purely quantitative analysis of figures of  civilian  death  and
           injuries etc. The  approach  must  be  qualitative  as  well  as
           quantitative. When assessing quantity and  quality,  courts  and
           tribunals should bear  in  mind  the  likelihood  of  unreported
           incidents and other uncertainties.

        c. Third, building on the case law,  Courts  and  Tribunals  should
           look in particular to see what the evidence tells us  about  the
           indicators of situations of violence and conflict (the following
           is intended as a non-exhaustive list):

              i. The parties to the conflict  and  their  relative  military
                 strengths and regard should be had to methods  and  tactics
                 of warfare applied (risk of civilian casualties);  type  of
                 weapons  used;  the  geographical  scope  of  the  fighting
                 (localised or  widespread)  and  the  number  of  civilians
                 killed, injured and displaced as a result of the fighting.


             ii. The ability or lack of it  by  the  State  to  protect  its
                 citizens  against  violence  (where  practicable,  it  will
                 assist  to  set  out  the  various  potential   actors   of
                 protection and to address their actual role)/the degree  of
                 State failure).

            iii. Socio-economic conditions (which should include  assessment
                 of economic and other forms of assistance by  international
                 organisations and NGOs).

             iv. Cumulative effects of long lasting armed conflicts.

   16. The respondent issued a Country Information and Guidance  report  in
       April 2016. Paragraph [3] makes clear that Yemen is in a  "state  of
       armed conflict which has led to a deterioration in the security  and
       humanitarian  situation."  The  policy  accepts  that   whilst   the
       situation in Aden  and  some  other  parts  of  southern  Yemen  had
       improved, Aden still faced huge security challenges including a rise
       of targeted killings and the presence of Al-Quaeda and  Daesh  which
       led to a curfew being imposed in January 2016.

   17. The respondent's policy concluded at 3.1.2 by stating-

      "The humanitarian situation in Aden ... while harsh is not in  general
      at such a level as to breach Article 3 but may do  so  for  vulnerable
      people and each case should be assessed on its individual merits.  The
      security situation in Aden ... is currently unlikely to breach article
      15(c) of the QD  but  particular  factors  relevant  to  the  person's
      individual circumstances or profile might place them at risk. However,
      the situation remains fluid and volatile and each case will need to be
      considered on its individual merits taking into  account  up  to  date
      country information."

   18. It is for this reason that I adjourned the last  hearing  to  enable
       both parties to place before me the latest information.  Mr  McVeety
       accepted that he had nothing to contradict Mr  Greer's  evidence.  I
       therefore have considered that evidence.

   19. The OHCHR report (August 4, 2016) confirms  increasing  attacks  and
       killings in Aden.

   20. The Foreign Office advises against all travel  to  Yemen  and  if  a
       person is in Yemen then he/she are advised to leave immediately. The
       same report re-affirmed that an 8pm to 8am curfew  applies  in  Aden
       and the police have also imposed a ban  on  motorcycles  within  the
       city. The  US  State  Department  provides  similar  advice  for  US
       citizens.

   21. Newspaper  articles  speak  of  ongoing  attacks  by  the  Saudi-led
       coalition and ongoing deaths as gunmen attacked the airport in Aden.
       However, these attacks appear to be  in  May/June  2016  and  whilst
       there are specific incidents of violence it is questionable  whether
       the latest situation reaches the level necessary for a valid article
       15(c) claim.

   22. In areas other than Aden there is an ongoing humanitarian  situation
       because the fighting is intense with attack after attack  from  both
       sides. Living in those areas would place the appellants at  risk  of
       indiscriminate violence but the  appellants  are  not  intending  to
       return to those  places.  Their  claims  of  persecution  have  been
       rejected and I saw no error in the Judge's approach to  that  aspect
       of their claims.

   23. None of the appellants have any enhanced risk which might place them
       at risk and I accordingly reject their claims under article 15(c).

   24. It is submitted that the Appellants' rights under the ECHR would  be
       affected if they were returned. The issues raised under humanitarian
       protection are similar to those matters raised under article 3  ECHR
       save the treatment of inhuman and degrading treatment is wider under
       the ECHR provisions.

   25. This issue again falls to be determined on the  matters  highlighted
       above. The material refers to forced displacement  and  eviction  in
       Aden and an ongoing threat of increased violence in Aden.

   26. In light of the objective material I accept, at this  present  time,
       there are substantial grounds for believing that the treatment which
       these Appellants run a real risk of suffering if they were  returned
       to the Yemen would amount to inhuman or degrading treatment.

DECISION

   27. Having previously found an error in law I  remake  the  decision  as
       follows:

   a. I uphold the dismissal of the appellants' asylum claims.
   b. I dismiss their claims for humanitarian protection.
   c. I allow their appeals under article 3 ECHR.
