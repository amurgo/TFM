                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge L K Gibbs promulgated on 5th December 2016, following  a  hearing
    at Hatton Cross on 7th November 2016.  In the determination, the judge
    dismissed  the  appeal  of  the  Appellant,  whereupon  the   Appellant
    subsequently applied for, and was granted, permission to appeal to  the
    Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Nigeria, a male, and  was  born  on  16th
    April 1962.  He arrived in the UK on 8th March 2005 as a  visitor,  and
    after his visit visa expired on 7th July 2005, he became an overstayer.
     In 2007 he was served with a notice of  removal.   In  February  2015,
    however, he made an application for leave to remain in the  UK  on  the
    basis of his private and family life.  That application was refused  by
    a decision dated 29th June 2015.  The Appellant  appeals  against  that
    decision.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim is that he and a Ms Dallas, who was born  in  the
    UK and is a UK citizen, are in a genuine and  subsisting  relationship.
    Ms Dallas has never been to Nigeria.  All her family  members  live  in
    the UK.  She has two adult children who live in the UK  and  she  cares
    for her grandson three days a week.   She  has  been  employed  by  the
    Department of Work and Pensions since 1990 and earns �26,975 per annum.
      She  also  suffers  from  Meniere's  disease  for  which  she   takes
    medication.  The Appellant himself has five children  in  Nigeria  with
    whom he speaks on the telephone,  and  his  mother  is  also  alive  in
    Nigeria and he has a half-brother and sister who live there.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge concluded that although it was the case that Ms Dallas was  a
    British citizen who had only ever lived in the UK,

         "... she has been aware of  the  Appellant's  lack  of  status  for
         several years.  I acknowledge that she has children in the UK  but
         they are adults and the  evidence  before  me  is  that  they  live
         independently of their mother.  Although I accept that  Ms  Dallas
         and the Appellant care for her grandson on a regular basis I am not
         persuaded that the disruption of this arrangement could be said  to
         be an insurmountable obstacle for the purposes of paragraph EX.2 of
         Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules" (paragraph 13).

 5. The judge then went on to consider the condition of Ms Dallas suffering
    from Meniere's disease which, "does not affect her  on  a  daily  basis
    (the medical  evidence  before  me  refers  to  her  'sometimes'  being
    trouble) and I place significant weight on the fact that  it  does  not
    prevent her from working" (paragraph 14).  The judge then had regard to
    the latest judgment in Agyarko [2015] EWCA Civ 440 in relation  to  the
    test relating to  "insurmountable  obstacles"  (at  paragraph  15)  and
    concluded that the Appellant would not face  significant  obstacles  to
    integration in Nigeria (paragraph 16).  Article 8  was  considered  and
    the case of SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA 387 applied (paragraph 17).

 6. The appeal was dismissed.

Grounds of Application

 7. The grounds of application state that the judge failed to  give  weight
    to the fact that the Appellant met all the provisions of  Appendix  FM,
    but no finding was made by the judge on this issue,  and  it  may  have
    affected the proportionality assessment, such that the  judge  did  not
    carry out a reasoned proportionality assessment,  taking  into  account
    the provisions of Section 117B.

 8. On 21st June 2017, permission to appeal was granted by the Tribunal.

 9. On 13th July 2017, a Rule 24 response was  entered  by  the  Respondent
    Secretary of State to the effect that the judge at  paragraph  13  gave
    reasons for his finding that there were no insurmountable obstacles  to
    the Appellant and his British citizen  partner  moving  to  Nigeria  to
    pursue their Article 8 rights.  The findings made  by  the  judge  were
    open to her to make.  The Grounds of Appeal were merely a  disagreement
    with the application of the Rules to the facts.

Submissions

10. At the hearing before me on 3rd August 2017, Ms  Appiah,  appearing  on
    behalf of the Appellant, relied upon the Grounds of Appeal and the  ten
    paragraphs therein, which covered  a  number  of  issues.   She  placed
    particular emphasis on two main issues.  First, there was the  question
    of "insurmountable obstacles".   Second,  there  was  the  question  of
    whether the judge should  have  looked  at  the  position  outside  the
    Immigration Rules.  The Appellant satisfied the provisions of  Appendix
    FM.  He was, however, an overstayer.  There was no  issue  relating  to
    the genuineness of the relationship with Ms Dallas and  the  fact  that
    they  had  a  subsisting  relationship.   At   paragraph   3   of   the
    determination,  the  judge  at  the  outset   makes   it   clear   that
    "insurmountable obstacles"  is  an  issue  before  her.   However,  the
    assessment, when it occurs, is such that from paragraphs 9 to  14,  the
    judge fails to give  particular  consideration  to  whether  there  are
    insurmountable obstacles to relocation.  The fact was  that  Ms  Dallas
    had not lived in Nigeria.  She had never been there.  She was a British
    citizen.  The  judge  needed  to  factor  in  these  matters  properly.
    Moreover, she was looking after her grandson (see  paragraph  13).   In
    addition  to  this  she  was  suffering  from  Meniere's  disease  (see
    paragraph 14) and the judge was wrong to say that the fact that she was
    not prevented from working did not shift the balance of  considerations
    in her favour.  This is because if one has regard  to  the  grounds  of
    application (at paragraph 6) it is clear that the prognosis of Dr Ajayi
    is that, "the attacks are unpredictable,  and  are  incapacitating  for
    hours at a time ...".  The judge ought to  have  discussed  Dr  Ajayi's
    diagnosis in this respect at paragraphs 13 to 14.

11. For his part, Mr Armstrong submitted that it  was  not  true  that  the
    judge did not consider  the  position  outside  the  Immigration  Rules
    because this is plain to see  at  paragraph  17.   One  must  also  not
    overlook the fact that this was an Appellant who had come  on  a  visit
    visa in 2005 and had then chose not to return, despite the fact that he
    had five children and a mother and a sister in Nigeria.  He has  stayed
    in  this  country  for  twelve  years.   He  now  claims  to  be  in  a
    relationship with Ms Dallas.  He is not married to her.  She  is  aware
    of his "precarious" immigration status, and has chosen to live with him
    knowing that this is the case.  The judge does not  overlook  the  fact
    that Ms Dallas earns �26,975 per annum (at paragraph 10).  But if  this
    is the case, then why is this Appellant any different  from  any  other
    person in his position, and why should he not be required as any  other
    person, to return back to his  country  and  make  an  entry  clearance
    application to join Ms Dallas in this country  in  the  proper  manner?
    There is no reason why he should not be required to do so.   He  cannot
    argue, as is sometimes done, that he would not be able to  satisfy  the
    financial threshold requirement because Ms Dallas earns more  than  the
    required amount.

12. He had after all spent 43 years in Nigeria and had a family there.   It
    is simply not reasonable to suggest that  the  provisions  of  the  law
    should not apply to him as much as they do to others and that he should
    not be required to return and make a proper  application,  rather  than
    simply have the benefit of staying unlawfully passed his visit visa  in
    2005.  As for the question  of  Ms  Dallas's  illness,  the  judge  had
    properly taken this into account.  She refers to it  at  paragraph  14.
    Not only is she able to work but there is no evidence at all  that  she
    could not be treated in Nigeria, should she wish to return  there  with
    the Appellant, if she does not want to support his application to  come
    back to this country.  What they cannot do is have it both ways.

13. It is important that the judge ends the determination by  reference  to
    Agyarko (at paragraph 15) and the recognition  there  that  the  phrase
    "insurmountable obstacles" is one which "imposes a high  hurdle  to  be
    overcome  by  an  applicant  for  leave  to  remain  under  the  Rules"
    (paragraph 15).  The Appellant could not satisfy  that  standard.   The
    judge did thereafter consider Article 8 outside  the  Rules  (paragraph
    17), and applying the law,  concluded  that  the  Appellant  could  not
    succeed.

14. In reply, Ms Appiah submitted that it was speculative to  suggest  that
    the Appellant, having entered on a visit visa in 2005, had no intention
    thereafter to return back to Nigeria.   Moreover,  this  was  the  case
    where Section 117 had not been considered by the judge.

No Error of Law

15. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1)  of
    TCEA 2007).  My reasons are as follows.

16. First, it is  not  the  case  that  the  judge  has  not  given  proper
    consideration to "insurmountable obstacles" facing the  Appellant.   He
    is in a relationship with Ms Dallas.  The two of them, however, are not
    married.  The judge gives consideration to this at paragraphs 9  to  12
    of the determination and observes that  the  Appellant  is  a  fit  and
    healthy man, who is a qualified person  and  who  has  previously  been
    employed in Nigeria.  It is open to the Appellant  to  return  back  to
    Nigeria in order to make a proper  application  under  the  Immigration
    Rules for entry clearance to join his partner in this  country.   There
    is nothing to suggest that such an application would not have as fair a
    chance as any other in being successfully  considered.   The  financial
    threshold requirement does not stand in the way of the  Appellant  (see
    paragraph 10).  Equally, it is open to Ms Dallas, should she  so  wish,
    to accompany the Appellant to Nigeria and be with him there for however
    long the two of them wish to be the case.

17. These are the findings of the judge and they are properly summarised at
    paragraph 13 of the determination, where the judge recognises that  the
    care of the children of Ms Dallas does not stand in the way  of  either
    of the two possibilities outlined above  being  pursued  because  these
    children are now adults and they live independently  of  their  mother.
    The judge does not ignore the fact that Ms  Dallas  and  the  Appellant
    care for her grandson on a regular basis, but  she  was  not  persuaded
    that  there  were  "insurmountable  obstacles"  for  the  purposes   of
    paragraph EX.2 of Appendix FM.

18. Second, the judge does give proper consideration to the  fact  that  Ms
    Dallas suffers from Meniere's disease (see paragraph 14).  She observes
    that she has not been prevented  from  working.   I  note  Ms  Appiah's
    submissions before me that Dr Ajayi in his report as the Appellant's GP
    dated 8th August 2014 states that the Meniere's disease attacks on  the
    Appellant are unpredictable and are incapacitating for hours at a time.
     However, the judge deals with  this  by  noting  that,  "it  does  not
    prevent her from working" and that "there is no evidence before  me  to
    persuade  me  that   Ms   Dallas's   medical   condition   creates   an
    insurmountable obstacle to family life continuing outside  of  the  UK"
    (paragraph 14).

19. Third, whilst the judge refers to the decision in Agyarko  [2015]  EWCA
    Civ 440, the Supreme Court has now given  judgment  in  Agyarko  [2017]
    UKSC  10  and  11  to  confirm  that  there  have  to  be  "exceptional
    circumstances",  which  is   taken   to   mean   "unjustifiably   harsh
    consequences for the individual" (see paragraph  60).   Furthermore  in
    referring to "exceptional circumstances" the Supreme Court has made  it
    clear that, "the European Court has said that, in cases concerned  with
    precarious family life, it  is  'likely'  only  to  be  in  exceptional
    circumstances that the removal of the non-national family  member  will
    constitute a violation of Article 8" (paragraph 58).

20. Fourth, the judge does consider the position  outside  the  Immigration
    Rules, and expressly makes this clear, and does so in  the  context  of
    the case law in SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA 387.  For all these reasons, the
    decision of the judge is comprehensive, clear,  and  soundly  based  in
    law.

Notice of Decision

21. There is no material error of law in  the  original  judge's  decision.
    The determination shall stand.

22. No anonymity direction is made.
