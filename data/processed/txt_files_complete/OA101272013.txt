For the Appellant:     Mrs S Saddiq, Senior Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr A J Hussain, of Legal and Legal, Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The parties are as described above, but are referred to in the rest  of
    this determination as they were in the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The Appellant sought entry clearance as a spouse.  The ECO refused that
    application by notice dated 4th March 2013, pointing out, amongst other
    reasons, that the Sponsor's  personal  bank  statements  did  not  show
    deposits corresponding to or reflecting the payments indicated  on  his
    payslips submitted for the relevant period:  "The deposits in  question
    only reflect these payments for  one  month  (the  most  recent  month)
    covered by the bank statements".

 3. Within his Grounds of Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal  the  Appellant
    accepted that the Sponsor's bank statements did not reflect his  wages.
    That was said to be because he was being paid  cash  in  hand  for  two
    jobs, so deposits into his account "did not correspond exactly  to  the
    amount paid in wages".

 4. Perhaps because there was no representation of the ECO  in  the  First-
    tier Tribunal, some of the more relevant features of the case appear to
    have been rather obscured.  In his determination  promulgated  on  10th
    March 2014 Judge P A Grant-Hutchison was  prepared  to  find  that  the
    "extraordinary coincidence" the Sponsor had been paid  the  exact  same
    salary by two different employers was just that, and not a  ground  for
    refusing the application.   He  went  on  to  find  at  ï¿½16  "from  the
    documents provided and the  Appellant's  [Sponsor's?]  statement"  that
    "the necessary documents were in fact lodged".

 5. The Appellant produced voluminous evidence, much of it inadmissible and
    irrelevant because it postdated  the  application.   It  is  not  clear
    whether the judge thought that the required correspondence between  the
    Sponsor's payslips and his personal bank statements was  shown  by  the
    evidence before the ECO, or by the later evidence.   But  the  lack  of
    correspondence on the evidence before  the  ECO  was  conceded  by  the
    Appellant in her Grounds of Appeal; and evidence of a later  period  of
    correspondence was neither admissible nor relevant.

 6. The ECO's Grounds of Appeal are that the judge failed to have regard to
    the evidential requirements set out in Appendix  FM-SE;  did  not  have
    regard to the relevant date being that of application; did not  address
    the relevant evidence at  that  date;  and  as  it  followed  that  the
    Appellant had not established the  Sponsor's  income  at  the  date  of
    application, the appeal could not properly have been allowed.

 7. On 8th April 2014 Designated  Judge  D  Taylor  granted  permission  to
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal, on  the  view  that  the  judge  arguably
    failed to ascertain the level of the Sponsor's income  as  at  date  of
    application and failed to have full regard to the requirements  of  the
    Rules.

 8. Further to the grounds, Mrs Saddiq submitted that the judge appeared to
    have misled himself (or to have been misled) into thinking that the one
    crucial issue was whether the coincidence of  the  Sponsor  being  paid
    exactly the same amount in cash  by  two  different  employers  had  an
    innocent explanation.  There was another decisive point which ended  up
    being blurred: the cash payments to the  Sponsor  could  not  meet  the
    requirements of the Rules, not because they were in cash or because  of
    the coincidence, but because  they  were  not  reflected  in  the  bank
    statements for the necessary six month period.

 9. Mrs Saddiq said that there was also error in that the  judge  expressed
    his concern about "this extraordinary coincidence" but went on to  hold
    that he was satisfied that  it  was  not  a  ground  for  refusing  the
    application, without giving any reason.

10. Mr Hussain said  that  the  documentary  evidence  in  support  of  the
    conclusions in the determination was in the Appellant's  bundle.   This
    was "not  new  evidence"  but  "elaborated  documents"  or  "additional
    documents" which could properly be taken into account as  well  as  the
    evidence supplied to the ECO.  He was unable to refer me to  any  legal
    authority to support that route for admission of further evidence.

11. Mr Hussain next submitted that even if  further  documents  should  not
    have been taken into account, there was enough evidence at the time  of
    application to  enable  it  to  be  allowed.   The  Appellant  provided
    contracts, employers' letters, payslips, forms P60 and so on.   It  was
    in order to take into account payments cash in hand, as long as it  was
    shown that the tax was paid  on  them.   The  ECO's  concern  over  the
    coincidence of wages amounted to no more  than  a  suspicion,  and  the
    judge was entitled to accept the Sponsor's explanation.

12. It emerged eventually during the submission that it was  accepted  that
    the Sponsor had not provided corresponding  bank  statements  and  wage
    slips over a period of six months to date of application,  as  required
    by the Rules, but for one month  only,  as  mentioned  above.   Further
    documents might have shown correspondence for a later  6  month  period
    only.  I observed to Mr Hussain that once that point was identified, it
    did not appear that there was anything wrong with the ECO's decision or
    any legal basis to reach any other conclusion.

13. Mr Hussain moved on to a submission that the  appeal  might  have  been
    allowed through the exercise of discretion available under  the  Rules.
    He was unable to refer me  to  any  specific  provision  of  the  Rules
    conferring such discretion, and he accepted that the case had not  been
    argued in the First-tier Tribunal on the basis that any such discretion
    existed.  Finally, he pointed out that the Rules  impose  detailed  and
    difficulty requirements and said that the outcome was harsh and unfair.
     Once the Sponsor became aware that he had  to  show  a  correspondence
    between his wages and payments into his bank account, from then  on  he
    ensured that was so.  It had been natural enough not to do so while was
    being cash in hand.  There was  now  such  evidence  extending  over  a
    period more than the six months required.

14.  I  indicated  that  the  ECO's  appeal  would  be  allowed   and   the
    determination of the First-tier Tribunal reversed.

15. The ECO was plainly correct to reject the application on the  basis  of
    the evidence  supplied,  because  the  bank  statements  did  not  show
    deposits corresponding with the payslips.

16. The First-tier Tribunal had no power to admit evidence or to  allow  an
    appeal  based  on  evidence  meeting  the  requirements  of  the  Rules
    subsequently to the date of application. The Rules require the evidence
    to be submitted with the application.

17. The case was not stated in the First-tier  Tribunal  on  the  basis  of
    discretion of the ECO or  the  FTT  to  overlook  shortcomings  in  the
    evidence.  I am not satisfied that there is any  such  discretion,  but
    even if there was, it is too late to raise that case now.

18. The requirements of the Rules may be detailed and  cumbersome  but  the
    FTT and UT  do  not  have  power  to  override  them  by  some  general
    overriding principle of fairness, nor by  evidence  relating  to  later
    dates and not supplied with the application.  The remedy in cases  like
    this is not by way of appeal to the FTT or to the UT but by  way  of  a
    properly supported application.

19. It may be that the judge erred in giving no reason  for  accepting  the
    "extraordinary coincidence" about the two wages, but that point is  not
    raised in the Grounds; and given the other findings herein, it need  be
    taken no further.

20. The determination of the First-tier  Tribunal  is  set  aside  and  the
    following determination  is  substituted:  the  appeal,  as  originally
    brought by Shazia Ahmed to the First-tier Tribunal, is dismissed.

21. No order for anonymity has been requested or made.
