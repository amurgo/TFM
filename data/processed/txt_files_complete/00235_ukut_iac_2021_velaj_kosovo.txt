               THE Secretary of State FOR THE Home Department
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr C Thomann, instructed by the Government Legal
Department
For the Respondent:    Mr Georget, instructed by Malik & Malik Solicitors


 1) In considering a piece of legislation designed  to  implement  European
    law,  a  purposive  construction  should  be  adopted  as  set  out  in
    Marleasing S.A v  LA  Commercial  Internacional  de  Alimentacion  S.A.
    [1992] 1 CMLR 305 and applying the principles set out  in  British  Gas
    Trading Ltd v Lock and Anor [2016] EWCA Civ 983 at [38].



 2) Where implementing legislation  goes  beyond  what  is  required  by  a
    Directive or to ensure compliance with rulings of the Court of Justice,
    there is no imperative to achieve a "conforming" interpretation, but  a
    careful analysis must be undertaken to determine  if  it  was  intended
    that the implementing legislation was to go beyond what flows from  the
    Directive; in any event, the same means of construction set out in  (1)
    must apply.


 3) On that basis, in construing reg. 16 (5) of the  Immigration  (European
    Economic Area) Regulations 2016 ("the EEA  Regulations"),  a  purposive
    approach must be followed, bearing in mind also that  the  question  of
    whether a child would be compelled to leave is a practical test  to  be
    applied to the actual facts and not  to  a  theoretical  set  of  facts
    (Patel v SSHD) [2019] UKSC 59 at [30] (applying  Chavez-Vilchez  [2017]
    EUECJ C-133/15). That is a necessary corollary of the use  of  "unable"
    in reg. 16(5).


 4) In order to meet the requirements  of  reg  16(5),  the  key  issue  is
    inability to reside in the United Kingdom  which  requires  a  detailed
    consideration of the circumstances of both carers.


 5) The EEA Regulations were revoked on 31 December 2020. Schedule 3 of the
    Immigration and Social Security Co-ordination (EU Withdrawal) Act  2020
    (Consequential, Saving, Transitional  and  Transitory  Provisions)  (EU
    Exit) Regulations (SI 2020/1309)  sets  out  those  parts  of  the  EEA
    Regulations  preserved  for  immigration  (but  not  social   security)
    purposes; reg.16 is not one of the provisions preserved.




                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State appealed with permission against the decision of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Ian  Scott,  promulgated  on  18  July  2019,
    allowing Mr Velaj's appeal against the decision  of  the  Secretary  of
    State made on 2 October 2017 to refuse  his  human  rights  claim,  the
    Secretary of State having made a deportation order  against  him.   For
    the reasons set out below, that decision was set aside.

 2. As the decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been  set  aside  to  be
    remade, we refer to Mr Velaj as the appellant and to the  Secretary  of
    State as the respondent as indeed they were in the First-tier Tribunal.



 3. The appellant is a citizen of Kosovo who entered the United Kingdom  in
    1998 and claimed asylum.   He  was  joined  here  by  his  wife,  elder
    children and his mother.  Two further children were born in the  United
    Kingdom.   They  are  all  now  British   citizens;   the   appellant's
    application was refused in light of his criminal record at the time.

 4. On 17 May 2011 the appellant was convicted of smuggling 3.97  kilograms
    of a class A drug (cocaine) into the United Kingdom  and  sentenced  to
    twelve years' imprisonment.  It was for that reason that the  Secretary
    of State made the deportation order against him.

 5.  The  appellant  appealed  under  Section  82(1)  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  ("the  2002  Act")  on  human  rights
    grounds with reference to Article 8 but at  the  appeal  raised  a  new
    matter: that he had a derivative  right  of  residence  in  the  United
    Kingdom under the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016
    ("the EEA Regulations").  The Secretary  of  State  consented  to  that
    matter being considered.

 6. The judge heard evidence from the appellant, his  wife  and  two  elder
    daughters.  In her evidence Mrs Velaj said [51], [52]  that  she  would
    not go to Kosovo with the appellant as she could not leave  his  mother
    and the children in the United Kingdom.

 7. The judge found that: -

      i) a parent of a British Citizen child is  entitled  to  a  derivative
         right of residence when  parental  responsibility  is  shared  with
         another person, if (Regulation 16(5)(c)) the child would be  unable
         to reside in the United Kingdom if both  primary  carers  left  the
         United  Kingdom  for  an  indefinite  period,  even  if  the  other
         carer/parent is a British citizen;

     ii) the appellant shares equal parental responsibility for his son with
         the wife/mother and the son would be unable to reside in the United
         Kingdom or another EEA state if both the  appellant  and  his  wife
         left the United Kingdom for an indefinite period; and,

    iii) accordingly, the appellant had a derivative right to reside in  the
         United Kingdom under the 2016 Regulations;

     iv) there was a right of appeal as the  issue  relating  to  Regulation
         36(5) requiring a valid national identity card had been conceded by
         the Secretary of State [69] to [71];

      v) Exception 3 set out in Section  33  of  the  UK  Borders  Act  2007
         applied as the appellant had a derivative right to  reside  in  the
         United Kingdom under the Regulations which give effect  to  the  EU
         treaties [73 to 74];

     vi) having had regard to Regulation  27  and  Schedule  1  of  the  EEA
         Regulations he was not satisfied that the appellant  represented  a
         risk or danger to society [80] despite the conviction for a serious
         offence and a lengthy prison sentence;

    vii) further, there are circumstances in this case such that there  were
         very compelling circumstances sufficient  to  overcome  the  public
         interest in the appellant's deportation for the purposes of Section
         117C(6) of the 2002 Act [90]  given  the  hardship  that  had  been
         caused to the appellant's wife and taking  account  also  the  best
         interests of his son.

 8. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal on  the  basis  that
    the judge  had  erred  in  misinterpreting  Regulation  16  which,  she
    contended, would apply only if both carers intended to leave the United
    Kingdom, which was not the case.  It was also averred  that  the  judge
    had  failed  properly  to  explain  how  there  were  very   compelling
    circumstances over and above those described in Exceptions 1 and  2  of
    Section 117C of the 2002 Act as, on the facts of this  case,  it  could
    not even be shown that the "unduly harsh" test had been met.

 9. On 19 August 2019 First-tier Tribunal Judge  S  P  J  Buchanan  granted
    permission on all grounds.

Procedural History

10. The appeal was initially set down for hearing on 5  November  2019  but
    was adjourned to permit the Secretary of State to file amended  grounds
    which was done on 17 December 2019.  A subsequent hearing set down  for
    30 April 2020 was adjourned in light of COVID and although the Tribunal
    provisionally considered disposing the issue of error of law by way  of
    written submissions, this was not possible, and the appeal  was  listed
    for oral hearing on 18 December 2020. At the end  of  that  hearing  we
    announced our decision that the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    involved the making of an error of law, was to be set aside, and was to
    be remade on a date to be fixed.  The appeal then re-convened on 5  May
    2021.

Amended Grounds of Appeal

11. The Secretary of State averred in her amended grounds that:

      i) the First-tier Tribunal had no jurisdiction to consider  an  appeal
         under the EEA Regulations as there had been no decision  under  the
         Regulations, this error not being cured by the Presenting Officer's
         consent for the matter to be considered;

     ii) the First-tier Tribunal erred in considering the  derivative  right
         of residence strengthened the appellant's Article 8 claim it  being
         applicable only to  deportees  who  are  unable  to  establish  any
         otherwise available entitlement to remain, in this case  under  the
         Human Rights Convention;

    iii) it was for the appellant to show that the child would be  compelled
         to leave the United Kingdom were he (the appellant) to be deported,
         the First-tier Tribunal's decision  pre-empting  the  Secretary  of
         State's  decision  and  misconstruing  the  scope  and  purpose  of
         Regulation 16;

     iv) the First-tier Tribunal  erred  in  pre-empting  the  Secretary  of
         State's decision as to whether, if there were a Zambrano  right  to
         reside, there were nonetheless grounds  of  public  policy,  public
         security and public health  to  justify  deportation,  reaching  an
         erroneous conclusion on that issue;

      v)  the  First-tier  Tribunal's  conclusions  that  there  were   very
         compelling   circumstances   were   inadequately    reasoned    and
         unsustainable.

Hearing on 18 December 2020

12. We were, to an extent,  assisted  by  a  skeleton  argument  served  in
    advance although for the  reasons  we  address  below,  these  did  not
    address several material issues and it was only as a result of our  own
    directions and reading beforehand that  material  and  relevant  issues
    came to light.

13. That said, however, there was a significant narrowing of the issues  in
    dispute which assisted the Tribunal.  The Secretary of  State  did  not
    pursue her amended ground (i) and it was agreed by both representatives
    that it would be sensible in hearing oral argument for us  to  consider
    ground (iii) first, it being agreed that if  there  was  no  derivative
    right that could be relied upon, then grounds (ii) and (iv)  would  not
    be relevant.

14. The thrust of Mr Thomann's  submissions  was  that  the  scope  of  the
    derivative residence as explained by the CJEU in Zambrano [2011]  EUECJ
    C-34/09; [2011] Imm AR  521  and  subsequent  cases  including  Chavez-
    Vilchez [2017] EUECJ C-133/15; [2017] Imm AR 1387 as  well  as  in  the
    decisions of the domestic courts is such that the derivative right  did
    not apply to circumstances here where one parent,  a  British  citizen,
    had no intention of leaving the United Kingdom and thus there would  be
    somebody to care for the British citizen child such that he  would  not
    be compelled to leave the United Kingdom or for that matter the EU.  He
    submitted therefore that there were no rights under EU  treaties  which
    were engaged and that insofar as the Regulations went further would not
    create a treaty right.

15. Mr Thomann submitted further that although an issue might arise in  the
    case of a mother being removed and the third country national  being  a
    very small child, that was not applicable  here.   He  submitted  that,
    further, Regulation 16 ought to be interpreted  on  a  purposive  basis
    such that it would conform to the express view of the Court of Justice.

16. Mr Georget conceded that, given the appellant's  wife's  evidence  that
    she would not leave the United Kingdom, it would not  be  possible  for
    him to show that, under the  relevant  case  of  the  CJEU,  he  had  a
    derivative right.  He  argued,  however,  that  Regulation  16(5)  went
    further than the case law,  and  that  on  the  clear  wording  of  the
    Regulation, greater rights had been granted than under European law and
    that  the  right  arose  from  a  permissible  interpretation  of   the
    Regulations.  Pressed on the point  as  to  whether  this  would  cause
    difficulties given the terms of the ground of appeal  on  EEA  matters,
    that is that the decision in question is contrary to Treaty rights,  he
    submitted  that  any  Tribunal  considering  that  issue   would   have
    considered the Regulations as expressing that.

17. In reply, Mr Thomann submitted that the purpose  of  Regulation  16  as
    amended was to give effect to Chavez-Vilchez  by  the  removal  of  the
    reference to an exempt person.  He  submitted,  relying  on  Litster  v
    Forth Dry Dock & Engineering Company Limited  [1988]  UKHL  10  that  a
    purposive construction should be applied, even where, as here,  it  was
    the state seeking to have the benefit of a narrower  construction.   Mr
    Georget disagreed with that.

18. Mr Thomann submitted that even if Mr Georget were correct,  then  on  a
    proper construction of Regulation 16(5)(c), it could not be  said  that
    it had the effect contended by the appellant.

19. After taking time for consideration, we announced our decision that  we
    found in favour of the Secretary of State on ground (iii) and  that  in
    consequence grounds (ii) and (iv) were no longer relevant.

20. We heard brief argument with regard to ground  (v)  and  announced  our
    decision that we were satisfied that the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal ought to be set aside for the reasons to be given in  writing.



The Law

21. In approaching how the EEA regulations are to be  interpreted  we  note
    that at 11pm on 31 January 2020 ("exit day") the United Kingdom  ceased
    to be a member  of  the  European  Union.  During  the  "implementation
    period" that lasted from then until  11pm  on  31  December  2020  ("IP
    completion day") EU law applied in the United Kingdom in general as  it
    would do if the UK had been a member of the EU.

22. We note that the EEA Regulations were revoked on 31 December  2020  and
    that the Immigration and Social Security Co-ordination (EU  Withdrawal)
    Act  2020   (Consequential,   Saving,   Transitional   and   Transitory
    Provisions) (EU Exit) Regulations  (SI  2020/1309)  ("EEA  Transitional
    Regs") preserve some of the 2016 Regulations as set out in Schedule  3.



23. As we are concerned with the law as it was at the date  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal's decision, we do not  consider  that  these  legislative
    changes are material; the issue  is  whether  the  FtT's  decision  was
    lawful as at the time it was made, that is, during  the  implementation
    period.

24. At the relevant time, reg. 16 of the EEA Regulations provided:

         16. Derivative Right to Reside

         (1)  A person has a derivative right to reside during any period in
         which the person-

             (a)  is not an exempt person; and

             (b)  satisfies  each  of  the  criteria  in  one  or  more  of
             paragraphs (2) to (6).

             ...

         (5)  The criteria in this paragraph are that-

             (a)  the person is the primary  carer  of  a  British  citizen
             ("BC");

             (b)  BC is residing in the United Kingdom; and

             (c)  BC would be unable to reside in the United Kingdom or  in
             another EEA State if [both primary carers] the person left the
             United Kingdom for an indefinite period.

         ...

         (7)  ...

             (c)  an "exempt person" is a person-

                  (i)  who has a right to reside under another provision  of
                  these Regulations;

                  (ii) who has the right of abode under  section  2  of  the
                  1971 Act2;

                  (iii)    to whom section 8 of the 1971 Act3, or  an  order
                  made under subsection (2) of that section, applies; or

                  (iv) who has indefinite leave to enter or  remain  in  the
                  United Kingdom (but see paragraph (7A)) .

         (8)  A person is the "primary carer" of another person ("AP") if-

             (a)  the person is a direct relative or a  legal  guardian  of
             AP; and

             (b)  either-

                  (i)  the person has primary responsibility for AP's  care;
                  or

                  (ii) shares equally the responsibility for AP's care  with
                  one other person [who is not an exempt person].

         (9)  In paragraph (2)(b)(iii), (4)(b) or (5)(c),  if  the  role  of
         primary carer is shared with  another  person  in  accordance  with
         paragraph (8)(b)(ii), the words "the person"  are  to  be  read  as
         "both primary carers".

         (10) Paragraph (9) does not apply if  the  person  with  whom  care
         responsibility is shared acquired a derivative right to  reside  in
         the United Kingdom as a result of  this  regulation  prior  to  the
         other person's assumption of equal care responsibility.

25. The words "both primary carers" have  been  added  to  reg  16  (5)  to
    reflect the effect of reg 16 (9)  and  the  words  in  italics  in  (8)
    (b)(ii) were deleted by operation of the Immigration (EEA)  (amendment)
    Regulations 2018 SI2018/801.  Prior to that  amendment,  the  appellant
    would not have been entitled to a derivative right of residence as  his
    wife is an exempt person.

26. The explanatory memorandum to SI 2018/801 provides:

         Paragraph 10 of the Schedule to these Regulations amends  the  2016
         Regulations so as to give effect to the judgment of the CJEU in the
         case of C-133/15 Chavez-Vilchez and others. It does so by  amending
         regulation 16(8)(b) of the 2016 Regulations to allow a person to be
         recognised as a "primary carer" if they are the sole  carer  or  if
         they share equally the care  with  another  person,  regardless  of
         whether that person is an "exempt person"  within  the  meaning  of
         regulation 16(7)(c).

27. We recall that Mr Georget conceded on behalf of the appellant  that  he
    could not bring himself within the scope of the derivative right as set
    out in the case law of the CJEU. He submitted that the appellant  falls
    within the terms of reg 16 (5) properly construed.

28. We consider that there is a significant issue arising from  the  nature
    of the ground of appeal provided for in the  EEA  Regulations.  At  the
    relevant time, regulation 36(1) provided that  the  provisions  of  the
    2002 Act listed in Schedule 2 had effect for the purposes of an  appeal
    under the Regulations.  Schedule 2 provided materially as follows:

         Schedule 2

         1. The following provisions of, or made under, the  2002  Act  have
         effect in relation to an appeal  under  these  Regulations  to  the
         First-tier Tribunal as if it were an appeal against a  decision  of
         the Secretary of State under section 82(1) of the 2002  Act  (right
         of appeal to the Tribunal)-

             section 84 (grounds of appeal), as though the  sole  permitted
             grounds  of  appeal  were  that  the  decision  breaches   the
             appellant's rights under the EU Treaties in respect  of  entry
             to or residence in  the  United  Kingdom  ("an  EU  ground  of
             appeal")

29. We do not consider that this ground of appeal would permit an appeal to
    be allowed in a situation where, for example, the EEA  Regulations  had
    granted a right which was greater than those granted by  the  treaties,
    despite Mr Georget's submission to the contrary. That would go  against
    the unambiguous wording of the ground of appeal and against  its  clear
    intent. If Parliament had wanted the ground of appeal to be whether the
    decision was contrary to the EEA regulations, then it would  have  said
    so.

30. That is not to say that meeting the requirements of the EEA Regulations
    if more extensive than the rights conferred  by  the  Treaties  is  not
    relevant.  We note that in OA and Others (human rights;  'new  matter';
    s.120) Nigeria [2019] UKUT 65  (IAC);  [2019]  Imm  AR  647  the  Upper
    Tribunal held at paragraphs [27] and [28]:

         27.  The significance of  an  appellant  proving  to  a  First-tier
         Tribunal  judge  that  he  or  she  meets  the  requirements  of  a
         particular immigration rule, so as to be entitled to be given leave
         to remain, lies in the fact that - provided Article 8 of  the  ECHR
         is engaged - the respondent will  not  be  able  to  point  to  the
         importance of maintaining immigration controls as a factor weighing
         in favour of the respondent in the proportionality balance, so  far
         as that factor relates to the particular immigration rule that  the
         Tribunal has found to be satisfied.

         28.           Whether  or  not  such  a  finding  in  favour  of an
         appellant is likely to be determinative of the human rights  appeal
         will depend upon whether the respondent has any additional  reason,
         effectively overriding that particular rule, for  saying  that  the
         effective  operation  of  the   respondent's   immigration   policy
         nevertheless outweighs the appellant's  interest  in  remaining  in
         this  country.  To  take  one  simple  example,  an  appellant  who
         persuades the First-tier Tribunal that he meets the requirements of
         the Immigration Rules relating to entrepreneur  migrants  will  not
         thereby succeed in his human rights appeal  if  the  appellant  has
         been found by the respondent (and the  Tribunal  agrees)  that  the
         appellant falls foul of one or  more  of  the  general  grounds  of
         refusal contained in Part 9 of the Rules; for example,  because  he
         made  false  representations  in   connection   with   a   previous
         application for leave (paragraph 322(2)).

31. We consider that these  principles  would  apply  equally  if  all  the
    requirements of the EEA Regulations were met.

32. It is not in dispute between the parties that the jurisprudence of  the
    Court of Justice beginning in Zambrano and continued in  Chavez-Vilchez
    and other cases flows from an interpretation of Articles 20 and  21  of
    the EU treaties.  That need not necessarily be a material  issue  given
    that any consideration of whether the requirements of  Regulations  are
    met or not would be a valid issue in assessing proportionality  in  any
    Article 8 exercise.  That is because a right to remain would  in  those
    circumstances indicate where the  Secretary  of  State  considered  the
    balance lay in public policy terms. We have therefore proceeded, out of
    an abundance of caution, to consider whether the EEA Regulations can be
    construed to include the appellant as he submits.

33. We agree with Mr Thomann that ordinarily, in  considering  a  piece  of
    legislation  designed  to   implement   European   law,   a   purposive
    construction should be adopted as  set  out  in  Marleasing  S.A  v  LA
    Commercial Internacional de Alimentacion S.A. [1992] 1 CMLR 305.

34. In British Gas Trading Ltd v Lock and Anor  [2016]  EWCA  Civ  983  the
    Court of Appeal reviewed the case law on 'conforming interpretation' of
    EU and human rights law and considered the core principles outlined  in
    Marleasing, Ghaidan v  Godin-Mendoza  [2004]  UKHL  30,  Vodafone  2  v
    Revenue and  Customs  Commissioners  [2009]  EWCA  Civ  446  and  Swift
    (trading as A Swift Move) v Robertson [2014] 1 WLFR  3438.   The  Court
    endorsed the approach taken in Vodafone 2 where the court approved  the
    summary of the principles  of  conforming  interpretation  prepared  by
    counsel for the HMRC.

         "37.  ...

         "In summary, the obligation on the English courts to construe
         domestic legislation consistently with Community law obligations is
         both broad and far-reaching. In particular: (a) it is not
         constrained by conventional rules of construction (per Lord Oliver
         of Aylmerton in the Pickstone case, at p. 126B); (b) it does not
         require ambiguity in the legislative language (per Lord Oliver in
         the Pickstone case, at p. 126B and Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead in
         Ghaidan's case, at para 32); (c) it is not an exercise in semantics
         or linguistics (per Lord Nicholls in Ghaidan's case, at paras 31
         and 35; per Lord Steyn, at paras 48-49; per Lord Rodger of
         Earlsferry, at paras 110-115); (d) it permits departure from the
         strict and literal application of the words which the legislature
         has elected to use (per Lord Oliver in the Litster case, at p 577A;
         per Lord Nicholls in Ghaidan's case, at para 31); (e) it permits
         the implication of words necessary to comply with Community law
         obligations (per Lord Templeman in the Pickstone case, at pp 120H-
         121A; per Lord Oliver in the Litster case, at p 577A); and (f) the
         precise form of the words to be implied does not matter (per Lord
         Keith of Kinkel in the Pickstone case, at p 112D; per Lord Rodger
         in Ghaidan's case, at para 122; per Arden LJ in the IDT Card
         Services case, at para 114)

         ...

         "The only constraints on the broad and far-reaching nature of the
         interpretative obligation are that: (a) the meaning should 'go with
         the grain of the legislation' and be compatible with the underlying
         thrust of the legislation being construed': see per Lord Nicholls
         in Ghaidan v. Godin-Medoza [2004] 2 AC 557, para 53; Dyson LJ in
         Revenue and Customs v. EB Central Services Ltd [2008] STC 2209,
         para 81. An interpretation should not be adopted which is
         inconsistent with a fundamental or cardinal feature of the
         legislation since this would cross the boundary between
         interpretation and amendment (see per Lord Nicholls, at para 33,
         Lord Rodger, at paras 110-113 in Ghaidan's case; per Arden LJ in R
         (IDT Card Services Ireland Ltd) v. Customs and Excise Comrs [2006]
         STC 1252, paras 82 and 113); and (b) the exercise of the
         interpretative obligation cannot require the courts to make
         decisions for which they are not equipped or give rise to important
         practical repercussions which the court is not equipped to
         evaluate: see the Ghaidan case, per Lord Nicholls, at para 33; per
         Lord Rodger, at para 115; per Arden LJ in the IDT Card Services
         case, at para 113.'"]

35. But that is not so where implementing legislation goes beyond  what  is
    required by a Directive or to ensure compliance  with  rulings  of  the
    Court of Justice.  In United States of America v Nolan [2015]  UKSC  63
    Lord Mance held at [14] as follows:

         14. Taking the first point  of  construction,  it  is  a  cardinal
             principle of European and domestic law  that  domestic  courts
             should construe domestic legislation intended to  give  effect
             to a European Directive so far as possible (or so far as  they
             can do so without going against the "grain"  of  the  domestic
             legislation) consistently with that Directive: Marleasing SA v
             La Comercial Internacional de Alimentacion SA (Case  C-106/89)
             [1990] ECR I-4135, Vodafone 2  v  Revenue  and  Customs  Comrs
             [2009] EWCA Civ 446, [2010] Ch 77, paras  37-38  and  Swift  v
             Robertson [2014] UKSC 50, [2014] 1 WLR 3438, paras 20-21.  But
             that means avoiding so far as possible  a  construction  which
             would have the effect that domestic  implementing  legislation
             did  not  fully  satisfy   the   United   Kingdom's   European
             obligations. Where a Directive offers a member state a choice,
             there can be no imperative to construe domestic legislation as
             having any particular effect, so long as it  lies  within  the
             scope of the permitted. Where  a  Directive  allows  a  member
             state to go further than  the  Directive  requires,  there  is
             again no imperative to achieve a "conforming"  interpretation.
             It may in a particular case be  possible  to  infer  that  the
             domestic legislature did not, by  a  domestic  formulation  or
             reformulation, intend to go  further  in  substance  than  the
             European requirement or minimum. R (Risk  Management  Partners
             Ltd) v Brent London Borough Council [2011] UKSC 7, [2011] 2 AC
             34, considered below,  is  a  case  where  the  Supreme  Court
             implied  into  apparently  unqualified  wording  of   domestic
             Regulations a limitation paralleling in scope that  which  had
             been implied by the Court of Justice into general  wording  of
             the Directive to which the Regulations were giving effect: see
             Teckal Srl v Comune di Viano (Case C-107/98) [1999] ECR I-8121
             ("Teckal"). It concluded that the two had been intended to  be
             effectively back-to-back. A reformulation may also  have  been
             aimed at using concepts or tools familiar in a domestic  legal
             context, rather than altering the substantive scope or  effect
             of the domestic measure from that at the European  level.  But
             that is as far as it goes.

36. We consider that that  applies  equally  here,  noting  that  Directive
    2004/38 permits  member  states  to  grant  greater  rights.   But  the
    question that arises is whether  it  is  possible  to  infer  that  the
    domestic legislation did intend to go further  in  substance  than  the
    European requirement or whether the intention  was,  instead,  for  the
    Regulations to be back-to-back with the jurisprudence of the CJEU.

37. In Nolan, at [23] Lord Mance also held:

         23. In Risk Management, the indications  were  that  the  domestic
             measure was intended in the relevant respect  to  be  no  more
             than back-to-back with the European Directive. That cannot  be
             said to  be  so  in  the  present  case.  TULCRA  contains  no
             equivalent of article 1(2)(b) of the  Directive.  Instead,  it
             contains specific and limited exceptions for Crown  employment
             and employees and for certain others in public service. It  is
             true that the remainder of  the  category  of  public  workers
             comprised  by  article  1(2)(b)  would  have  been  relatively
             confined, comprising those engaged in the "exercise of  public
             powers", rather than  economic  functions,  as  the  Court  of
             Justice indicated in Scattolon  v  Ministero  dell'Istruzione,
             dell'Universit�, e della Ricerca (Case  C-108/10)  [2012]  ICR
             740, paras 43-44. But this remaining category  is  nonetheless
             significant.  Contrary  to  the  appellant's  submission,  its
             inclusion within the scope of TULCRA  cannot  have  been  mere
             oversight.  The  careful  exclusion   of   several   specified
             categories of public employee speaks for itself. The variation
             of  the  Directive  scheme  enables,  and  according  to   the
             Employment  Appeal  Tribunal  (para  84)  has  in  many  cases
             enabled, cases to be brought by those representing workers  in
             public authorities. There are also  other  respects  in  which
             provisions of TULCRA have given  protection  in  the  form  of
             consultation obligations which extends  or  has  in  the  past
             extended,   clearly   deliberately,   beyond   the    European
             requirement. It is, as Underhill LJ observed in the  Court  of
             Appeal (para 24) well understandable that a Labour  government
             should in 1975, with trade union encouragement,  have  decided
             to give the scheme an extended domestic application to  public
             employees.

38. In some  respects,  this  situation  is  comparable  to  that  in  Risk
    Management Partners Limited v Brent London Borough Council  and  Others
    [2011] UKSC 7 in that the Regulations in question  were  made  to  give
    effect to a Directive, in that case Directive 2004/18.   And  there  is
    also in the background a decision of the CJEU, Teckal [1999]  EUECJ  C-
    107/98.

39. In Risk Management Lord Hope held at [24] to [25]:

         24.   It is true that section 2(2) of the European Communities  Act
             1972 is in wide terms. It does not confine any  measures  made
             under it to doing the minimum necessary to give  effect  to  a
             Directive. But, if it is  to  be  within  the  powers  of  the
             subsection, the measure has to arise out of or be  related  to
             an EU obligation. As Waller LJ said in Oakley Inc v Animal Ltd
             (Secretary of State for Trade and Industry intervening) [2006]
             Ch 337, para  39,  the  primary  objective  of  any  secondary
             legislation under section 2(2) must be  to  bring  into  force
             laws which, under the Treaties, the United Kingdom has  agreed
             to make part of its laws. There is nothing in the  Explanatory
             Memorandum to the Regulations that was prepared by the  Office
             of Government Commerce and laid before Parliament to  indicate
             that it was intended to depart from the jurisprudence  of  the
             court as to the scope of the Directive. In  paras  7.2-7.4  of
             the  Memorandum  it  was  stated  that  the  change   to   the
             legislation  was  necessary  to  implement  the   new   public
             procurement Directive, that it clarified  and  modernised  the
             previous texts and that the simpler and more consistent public
             sector text should reduce the burdens involved  under  the  EU
             rules. If the Teckal exemption were to be held not to apply to
             the 2006 Regulations, it could only be because the purpose  of
             the Regulations was to apply the public procurement  rules  to
             relationships that fell outside the regime provided for by the
             Directive.  But  that  would  not  be  consistent   with   the
             Memorandum, and it would not be a permitted use of the power.

         25.  As for the meaning and effect of the 2006 Regulations, I think
             that it would be wrong to apply  a  literal  approach  to  the
             words and phrases used in it, such as in  the  definitions  of
             "public contract" and "public service contract".  A  purposive
             approach  should  be  adopted.  As  Lord  Diplock  in  Kammins
             Ballrooms Co Ltd v Zenith Investments (Torquay) Ltd [1971]  AC
             850, 881 indicated, this means that regard must be had to  the
             context in which the Regulations were made, to  their  subject
             matter and to their purpose. Would it be inconsistent with the
             achievement of that purpose if the Teckal exemption  were  not
             to be held to apply to them? Was this an  exemption  to  which
             Parliament must have  intended  them  to  be  subject?  Having
             regard  to  the  background  of  EU  law  against  which   the
             Regulations were made, the definitions in the Regulations  can
             be taken to express the same idea as those in  the  Directive.
             Thus something which amounts to a contract in domestic law can
             nevertheless be held, without  doing  undue  violence  to  the
             words of the Regulations, not to be a  relevant  contract  for
             the purpose of the public procurement rules.

40. We remind ourselves that in Chavez-Vilchez, the CJEU concluded:

         69.  As regards the second factor, the Court has stated that it  is
             the relationship of dependency between the Union  citizen  who
             is a minor and the third country national  who  is  refused  a
             right  of  residence  that  is  liable   to   jeopardise   the
             effectiveness  of  Union  citizenship,  since   it   is   that
             dependency that would lead to the Union citizen being obliged,
             in practice, to leave not only the  territory  of  the  Member
             State of which he is a national but also that of the  European
             Union as a whole, as a consequence of such a refusal (see,  to
             that effect, judgments of 8 March  2011,  Ruiz  Zambrano,  C-
             34/09, EU:C:2011:124, paragraphs 43 and 45;  of  15 November
             2011,   Dereci   and    Others,    C-256/11,    EU:C:2011:734,
             paragraphs 65 to 67; and of 6 December 2012, O and Others, C-
             356/11 and C-357/11, EU:C:2012:776, paragraph 56).

         70.  In this case, in order to assess the risk  that  a  particular
             child, who is a Union citizen, might be compelled to leave the
             territory of the European Union and thereby be deprived of the
             genuine enjoyment of the substance of the rights conferred  on
             him by Article 20 TFEU if the child's third-country  national
             parent were to be refused a right of residence in  the  Member
             State concerned, it is important to determine, in each case at
             issue in the main proceedings, which  parent  is  the  primary
             carer of the child and whether there is in fact a relationship
             of dependency between the child and the third-country national
             parent. As part of that assessment, the competent  authorities
             must take account of the right to respect for family life,  as
             stated in Article 7 of the Charter of Fundamental  Rights  of
             the European Union, that  article  requiring  to  be  read  in
             conjunction with the obligation to take into consideration the
             best interests of the child, recognised in  Article 24(2)  of
             that charter.

         71.  For the purposes of such an  assessment,  the  fact  that  the
             other parent, a Union citizen, is actually able and willing to
             assume sole responsibility for the primary day-to-day care  of
             the child is a relevant factor, but it  is  not  in  itself  a
             sufficient ground for a conclusion that there is not,  between
             the third-country  national  parent  and  the  child,  such  a
             relationship of dependency that the child would  be  compelled
             to leave the territory of the European Union  if  a  right  of
             residence were refused  to  that  third-country  national.  In
             reaching such a conclusion, account must be taken, in the best
             interests  of  the  child  concerned,  of  all  the   specific
             circumstances, including the age of  the  child,  the  child's
             physical  and  emotional  development,  the  extent   of   his
             emotional ties both to the Union citizen  parent  and  to  the
             third-country national parent, and the risks which  separation
             from the latter might entail for that child's equilibrium.

         72.  ... Article 20 TFEU must be interpreted as meaning  that  for
             the purposes of assessing whether a child who is a citizen  of
             the European Union would be compelled to leave  the  territory
             of the European Union as a whole and thereby deprived  of  the
             genuine enjoyment of the substance of the rights conferred  on
             him by that article  if  the  child's  third-country  national
             parent were refused a right of residence in the  Member  State
             concerned, the fact that the other  parent,  who  is  a  Union
             citizen,  is  actually  able  and  willing  to   assume   sole
             responsibility for the primary day-to-day care of the child is
             a relevant factor, but it is not in itself a sufficient ground
             for a conclusion that there is not, between the  third-country
             national  parent  and  the  child,  such  a  relationship   of
             dependency that the child would indeed be  so  compelled  were
             there to be such a refusal of a right of  residence.  Such  an
             assessment must take into account, in the  best  interests  of
             the child concerned, all the specific circumstances, including
             the age of the  child,  the  child's  physical  and  emotional
             development, the extent of his  emotional  ties  both  to  the
             Union citizen parent and to the third-country national parent,
             and the risks which separation from the  latter  might  entail
             for the child's equilibrium.

41. As was noted in Patel v SSHD [2019] UKSC 59; [2020] Imm AR 600 at [30]:

         30.  The overarching question is whether the son would be compelled
             to leave by reason of his relationship of dependency with  his
             father. In answering that question, the court is  required  to
             take account, "in the best interests of the  child  concerned,
             of all the specific circumstances, including the  age  of  the
             child, the child's physical  and  emotional  development,  the
             extent of his emotional ties both to the Union citizen  parent
             and to the third-country national parent, and the risks  which
             separation from the  latter  might  entail  for  that  child's
             equilibrium" (Chavez-Vilchez, para 71). The test of compulsion
             is thus a practical test to be applied to the actual facts and
             not to a theoretical set of facts. As explained in para 28  of
             this judgment,  on  the  FTT's  findings,  the  son  would  be
             compelled to leave with his father, who was his primary carer.
             That  was  sufficient  compulsion  for  the  purposes  of  the
             Zambrano test. There is an  obvious  difference  between  this
             situation  of  compulsion  on  the  child  and   impermissible
             reliance on the right to respect for family  life  or  on  the
             desirability of keeping the family together as  a  ground  for
             obtaining a derivative residence card.  It  follows  that  the
             Court of Appeal was wrong in this case to bring  the  question
             of the mother's choice into the assessment of compulsion.

42. Drawing these strands together, we deduce the following principles:

      i) in  considering  a  piece  of  legislation  designed  to  implement
         European law, a purposive construction should be adopted as set out
         in Marleasing S.A v LA  Commercial  Internacional  de  Alimentacion
         S.A. [1992] 1 CMLR 305 and applying the principles set  out  in  In
         British Gas Trading Ltd v Lock and Anor [2016] EWCA Civ 983at [38];

     ii) where implementing legislation goes beyond what is  required  by  a
         Directive or to ensure compliance with  rulings  of  the  Court  of
         Justice,  there  is  no  imperative  to  achieve   a   "conforming"
         interpretation  but  a  careful  analysis  must  be  undertaken  to
         determine if it was intended that the implementing legislation  was
         to go beyond what flows from the Directive; in any event, the  same
         means of construction set out in (1) must apply;

    iii) On that basis, in construing reg. 16 (5) of the EEA Regulations,  a
         purposive approach must be followed, bearing in mind also that  the
         question of whether a child  would  be  compelled  to  leave  is  a
         practical test to be applied to the  actual  facts  and  not  to  a
         theoretical set of facts (Patel v SSHD)  [2019]  UKSC  59  at  [30]
         (applying  Chavez-Vilchez  [2017]  EUECJ  C-133/15).  That   is   a
         necessary corollary of the use of "unable" in reg. 16(5).

43. We note that as in Risk Management, the EEA Regulations  are  made,  as
    stated in the preamble, pursuant to powers under section  2(2)  of  the
    1972 Act. We consider  that  in  all  the  circumstances,  a  purposive
    interpretation must be adopted.  As  here,  there  was  an  explanatory
    memorandum which sets out the purpose of the  relevant  provisions  and
    amendment and states that the  intention  is  to  give  effect  to  the
    jurisprudence of the CJEU.

44. We consider also that what the  jurisprudence  requires  is  a  careful
    analysis of whether a child would be  compelled  to  leave  the  United
    Kingdom; "unable to reside" is  a  question  that  requires  a  nuanced
    analysis of inability, not as Mr Georget submits, a simple analysis  of
    a hypothetical question.

45. Further, we bear in mind that we are considering delegated legislation.
     We bear in mind that the legal meaning of an enactment is the  meaning
    that conveys the legislative intention.  The focus must be on the  text
    which is the primary source for its meaning.  The  initial  wording  of
    Regulation 16 was clear.  It did not apply  in  circumstances  such  as
    these; it is only with the removal of the words "who is not  an  exempt
    person" that it has the effect that the appellant now contends it  has.



46. Prior to the amendment, a derivative right would in these circumstances
    not arise where there were two parents who shared  care  where  one  of
    them had a right to reside under the Regulations  or  had  a  right  of
    abode under the Immigration Act 1971 or had indefinite leave to remain.
     The effect of the amendment,  if  the  appellant's  interpretation  is
    correct, is to expand considerably the cases of person on  whom  rights
    would be conferred because the right arises by operation  of  law;  the
    issue of a derivative right card is merely confirmatory of that status.



47. The interpretation contended for would, on that basis, be  contrary  to
    intent and effect of Section 117B(6) and Section 117C(5)  of  the  2002
    Act.  That is because the derivative right would come into existence at
    the point at which dependency of the child came into  existence.   That
    is because there are limited circumstances in which, were both  parents
    to leave the United Kingdom, a child would be able  to  reside  in  the
    United Kingdom.

48. Finally, we note the use of the word "unable" is part of the test to be
    applied, even if a purposive approach were  not  taken.   That,  as  is
    evident from Patel, is a question  to  be  answered  after  a  detailed
    consideration which was not  undertaken  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal.
    Thus, the key issue of  inability  to  reside  in  the  United  Kingdom
    requires detailed consideration and a causal link with the departure of
    both carers.

49. For these reasons, we conclude that reg 16 (5) cannot be  construed  in
    the manner contended by the appellant, that is, simply on a theoretical
    assumption of both parents leaving the United Kingdom.

50. Accordingly, for  these  reasons,  we  are  satisfied  that  the  judge
    misinterpreted the Regulations in concluding that the appellant  had  a
    derivative right.

51. As an aside, as noted above, the EEA  Regulations were  revoked  on  31
    December 2020 as part of a large number of changes brought  in  at  the
    same time,  primarily  by  the  Immigration  and  Social  Security  Co-
    ordination   (EU   Withdrawal)   Act   2020   (Consequential,   Saving,
    Transitional and  Transitory  Provisions)  (EU  Exit)  Regulations  (SI
    2020/1309) ("EEA Transitional Regs") and the  Immigration,  Nationality
    and Asylum (EU Exit) Regulations  (SI 2019/745).  Schedule 3 of the EEA
    Transitional Regs sets out those parts of the EEA Regulations preserved
    for immigration (but  not  social  security)  purposes  under  the  EEA
    Transitional Regulations, and it is of note that reg.16 is omitted from
    those provisions.

52. It follows from the finding that there  is  no  derivative  right  that
    grounds (ii) and (iv) are academic; if there is a derivative right, the
    errors about which they complain are not material.

53. Had we, however, been asked to consider them in detail, we  would  have
    concluded that ground  (ii)  is  not  made  out.   A  derivative  right
    crystallises at the point of dependency; that much is clear from Sanneh
    [2015] EWCA Civ 49; [2015] 2 CMLR 27; [2015] Imm AR 669 (per Arden LJ).
     Further, it is clear from the binding decision in Dereci  that  it  is
    only after consideration of a Zambrano right that regard should then be
    paid to considerations under Article 8 of the Human  Rights  Convention
    (or for that matter Article 7 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights  and
    Freedoms).

54. Further, with respect  to  ground  (iii),  the  issue  with  regard  to
    Zambrano is  whether  the  British  citizen  child  would  in  fact  be
    compelled to leave the territory of  the  European  Union  as  a  whole
    thereby deprived of genuine enjoyment of  the  rights  of  citizenship.
    That was clearly not found.

55. We turn then to ground (v).  Given  our  findings  in  respect  of  the
    derivative right, we conclude  that  any  findings  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal were, insofar as they related to Article 8, predicated on  the
    assumption of there being a derivative right.  Further, in  any  event,
    there is simply an insufficient basis  for  demonstrating  that  either
    exclusion 1 or exclusion 2 was made out or that there  were,  balancing
    the public interest, very  compelling  reasons  such  that  deportation
    should not be proceeded with.  Even in the light  of  recent  Court  of
    Appeal jurisprudence the tests set out in exceptions 1 and 2 are  still
    high, all the more so where, as  here,  the  sentence  was  for  twelve
    years' imprisonment.  Accordingly, we consider that ground  5  is  made
    out.

56. For these reasons, we set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal
    to be re-made as it was necessary  to  hear  evidence  again  from  the
    appellant and his family and to have, if required updated  evidence  in
    respect of any medical problems that may exist.

Re-making the Appeal

57. The hearing reconvened before us on 5 May 2021.  Both parties  accepted
    that the material issues are related to a consideration  of  Article  8
    Human Rights Convention and are agreed as to the relevant law.

58. Section 117C of the 2002 Act provides as follows:

         117C Article 8: additional considerations in cases involving
         foreign criminals

         (1) The deportation of foreign criminals is in the public interest.

         (2) The more serious the offence committed by a foreign criminal,
         the greater is the public interest in deportation of the criminal.

         (3) In the case of a foreign criminal ("C") who has not been
         sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years or more, the
         public interest requires C's deportation unless Exception 1 or
         Exception 2 applies.

         (4) Exception 1 applies where-

         (a) C has been lawfully resident in the United Kingdom for most of
         C's life,

         (b) C is socially and culturally integrated in the United Kingdom,
         and

         (c) there would be very significant obstacles to C's integration
         into the country to which C is proposed to be deported.

         (5) Exception 2 applies where C has a genuine and subsisting
         relationship with a qualifying partner, or a genuine and subsisting
         parental relationship with a qualifying child, and the effect of
         C's deportation on the partner or child would be unduly harsh.

         (6) In the case of a foreign criminal who has been sentenced to a
         period of imprisonment of at least four years, the public interest
         requires deportation unless there are very compelling
         circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions 1 and
         2.

         (7) The considerations in subsections (1) to (6) are to be taken
         into account where a court or tribunal is considering a decision to
         deport a foreign criminal only to the extent that the reason for
         the decision was the offence or offences for which the criminal has
         been convicted.

     Paragraph 398 of the Immigration Rules replicates the framework.

59. Both parties were agreed that in the case of individuals who have  been
    sentenced to a period of imprisonment of  four  years  or  more  or  if
    neither Exception is to be met, the test is  one  of  "very  compelling
    circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions 1 and 2".

60. We accept that "over and above the  Exceptions"  does  not  exclude  or
    restrict the analysis to factors relevant to the issues dealt  with  in
    the Exceptions and we adopt the approach endorsed by Jackson LJ  in  NA
    (Pakistan) v SSHD [2016] EWCA Civ 662; [2017] Imm AR 1 at [37]:

         37.  In relation to a serious offender, it will often  be  sensible
         first to see whether his case involves circumstances  of  the  kind
         described in Exceptions 1 and 2, both because the circumstances  so
         described set out particularly  significant  factors  bearing  upon
         respect for private life (Exception 1) and respect for family  life
         (Exception 2) and because that may provide a helpful basis on which
         an assessment can  be  made  whether  there  are  "very  compelling
         circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions  1  and
         2" as is required under section 117C(6). It will then be  necessary
         to look to see whether any of the factors falling within Exceptions
         1 and 2 are of such  force,  whether  by  themselves  or  taken  in
         conjunction with any other relevant  factors  not  covered  by  the
         circumstances described in Exceptions 1 and 2, as  to  satisfy  the
         test in section 117C(6).

61. We observe  also  the  comments  made  by  the  Upper  Tribunal  in  MS
    (s.117C(6): "very compelling circumstances")  Philippines  [2019]  UKUT
    122 (IAC); [2019] Imm AR 767 at [16] and [20]:

         16. By contrast, the issue of whether "there  are  very  compelling
         circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions  1  and
         2" is not in any sense a hard-edged question. On the  contrary,  it
         calls for a wide-ranging  evaluative  exercise.  As  NA  (Pakistan)
         holds, that exercise is  required,  in  the  case  of  all  foreign
         criminals, in order  to  ensure  that  Part  5A  of  the  2002  Act
         produces, in each such case, a result that is compatible  with  the
         United Kingdom's obligations under Article 8 of the ECHR.

         ...

         20.            For  these  reasons,  despite  Ms   Patyna's elegant
         submissions, we find the effect of section 117C is that a court  or
         tribunal,  in  determining  whether  there  are   very   compelling
         circumstances, as  required  by  subsection  (6),  must  take  into
         account the seriousness of the particular  offence  for  which  the
         foreign criminal was convicted, together with  any  other  relevant
         public interest considerations. Nothing in KO (Nigeria)  demands  a
         contrary conclusion.

62. We accept also that that decision confirms the propositions put forward
    by Mr Thomann that:

      i) in determining the public interest, regard is to be had to what  is
         said in Section 117C(2); namely, that the more serious the offence,
         the greater is the public interest in deportation (MS at [47]);

     ii) by making  the  seriousness  of  the  offence  the  touchstone  for
         determining the strength of the  public  interest  in  deportation,
         parliament, in enacting Section 117C(2), must have intended  courts
         and Tribunals to have regard to more  than  the  mere  question  of
         whether the particular foreign criminal, if allowed  to  remain  in
         the United Kingdom, would pose a risk to United Kingdom society( MS
         at [50]);

    iii) an element of the general public interest is the  deterrent  effect
         upon foreign citizens "of understanding that a serious offence will
         normally precipitate their deportation [might] be a  more  powerful
         aid to the prevention of crime than the removal from the UK of  one
         foreign criminal judged as likely to reoffend" (MS at [69]).

63. With regards to the extent to which rehabilitation is to be taken  into
    account we have applied the principles set out  in  HA  (Iraq)  v  SSHD
    [2020] EWCA Civ 1176; [2021] Imm AR 59 at [132] to [141].

64. At the hearing on 5 May 2021, we heard evidence from the appellant, the
    appellant's wife and their two daughters.  The appellant's  mother  was
    present but did not give evidence.

65. It is common ground that the findings of fact made  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal are preserved.  The judge noted [16] that it had been accepted
    that  the  family   experienced   problems   during   the   appellant's
    imprisonment as follows:-

      a) There was conflict between Tarzana and her mother which resulted in
         Tarzana being barred from the family home, being  taken  into  care
         the care of the local authority and living apart from the  rest  of
         the family in a hostel.  It was noted, however,  that  Tarzana  was
         now an adult, able to make her own decisions and live her own life.
          She could choose to follow the appellant  to  Kosovo  or  maintain
         contact with him there by modern means of communication.

      b) Tanja struggled emotionally while the appellant was absent from the
         family home in prison.  She was expelled from school, continued  to
         have behavioural problems at her next school and later dropped  out
         of her course at college.  She did, however, manage to obtain  four
         GCSEs, including mathematics and English (both at  C).   She  would
         soon be an adult (and is now) and these qualifications would assist
         her in seeking employment.

      c) Matthew also struggled  emotionally  in  the  appellant's  absence.
         Although he was able to maintain good behaviour and performance  at
         school, they were  concerned  that  this  might  not  last  if  the
         appellant were to be deported.

    ...

      d)  The  appellant's  wife  was  diagnosed  with  depression  and  was
         prescribed medication.

      e) The appellant's mother also receives medication for  depression  as
         well as hypertension and was noted to have suffered a stroke.

66. The judge also found:-

      i) that the appellant's expression  of  remorse  and  his  account  of
         pursuing rehabilitation with assistance for the sake of his  family
         to be credible and genuine [79(b)];

     ii) that there was evidence the appellant had been co-operative and  of
         good behaviour in prison and had not reoffended since  his  release
         on 2 June 2017;

    iii) that there was no reason to think  that  prison  had  not  had  the
         intended rehabilitative effect on the appellant and he  had  strong
         incentives not to reoffend [79(d) to (e)];

     iv) The appellant's mother is paralysed down one side and now  requires
         constant care. Her  more  recent  shocking  ordeal,  when  she  was
         attacked and injured by burglars, has left  her  extremely  anxious
         and vulnerable. There is clearly very strong dependence on the care
         provided by the appellant and his wife. It is  equally  clear  that
         she cannot be expected to relocate.  The  appellant's  removal  and
         exclusion from  the  UK  would  effectively  mean  a  complete  and
         permanent separation of mother and son. A  professional  carer  (at
         the public  expense)  could  not  possibly  replace  the  emotional
         support provided by the appellant, and his mother is understandably
         scared of anyone she does not know. The impact of his exclusion  on
         her and their relationship would be profound [83. (a)].

      v) The appellant's wife is innocent of all wrongdoing but has suffered
         as a result of the appellant's offending. His absence in prison led
         to depression, anxiety and serious difficulties for her  in  caring
         not only for her children  but  also  for  her  mother-in-law.  The
         appellant's exclusion from the UK would mean that  she  would  have
         little choice but to stay in the  UK  and  bear  the  same  burdens
         again. She would in  effect  be  separated  indefinitely  from  her
         husband of 25 years and would be  left  to  carry  all  the  family
         responsibilities on her own once again [83. (b)].

     vi) It is clearly in the best interests of the appellant's children  to
         have  both  their  parents  in  the  UK  and  to   continue   their
         relationship with their father. The impact of his absence while  in
         prison was clear  and  was  significant  for  all  three  children.
         Matthew is still a child, but all three of them are very  close  to
         their father and  there  is  a  strong  family  and  private  life.
         Occasional visits (if possible) to  see  their  father  in  Kosovo,
         together with electronic communication, could  not  possibly  be  a
         sufficient replacement for  personal  contact.  Having  lost  their
         father once already at, crucial stages of their lives,  they  would
         lose him again in the event of  his  removal  and  exclusion.  Like
         their mother, they are completely innocent in the matter [83. (c)].

    vii) The appellant has established a private  life  and  has  integrated
         into the UK. He arrived here at the age of 19 and,  notwithstanding
         his period of imprisonment, he has spent virtually  all  his  adult
         life in this country. I accept that  he  has  developed  meaningful
         social and cultural ties in that time [83. (d)].

   viii) Although the appellant can  speak  Albanian,  he  knows  nobody  in
         Kosovo and would be returning there as  a  complete  outsider  now,
         with nothing from which to establish himself [83. (e)].

67. Those conclusions were, we recall, made on 26  July  2019,  nearly  two
    years ago and we accept that changes  have  occurred  since  them.   We
    accept  from  the  oral  evidence  that  the  appellant  has  a   close
    relationship with his son and with  his  mother  for  whom  he  is  the
    principal carer.  She lives a short distance from family but we  accept
    that she forms part of the same family unit  given  her  dependency  on
    them.  We accept also that the appellant has a close relationship  with
    his son and that his daughter, Tarzana, is able  to  help  out  looking
    after the mother for short periods when the appellant is unable  to  do
    so.  We accept also that he intends to seek work if permitted to  stay,
    as he said he would in cross-examination and that he has qualifications
    as a carpenter.  We accept that he has high blood pressure for which he
    receives medication.  We accept also, as Mr Georget submitted, that the
    appellant's wife's level of depression has improved and  that  she  has
    been able, since the appellant was released, to open a caf�.  The hours
    are currently restricted but will  extend  into  the  evenings  as  the
    restrictions imposed by the COVID lockdown change.  We accept also that
    her daughter, Tarzana, helps at the caf�.

68. We find that  it  would  be  difficult,  if  not  impossible,  for  the
    appellant's wife to keep the caf� going as a  viable  business  if  she
    were also to have to care for the appellant's mother to the  extent  of
    the care currently provided by the appellant.

69. We do not, however, accept Mrs Velaj's  evidence  that  she  could  not
    visit the appellant in Kosovo or elsewhere.   Her  answers  when  asked
    that she did not know the country and that she would  not  be  able  to
    leave her mother-in-law even for a short visit are difficult to accept.



70. We consider it appropriate to start our analysis with Exception 2.   In
    doing so, we note that the deportation of the appellant impacts also on
    his mother and that in turn, that impact has an effect on the situation
    of his wife and of his children.

71. We accept that the appellant's wife would not go to live in Kosovo  nor
    do we consider that it would be reasonable to expect her to do so.  She
    has now developed a life in  the  United  Kingdom,  she  is  a  British
    citizen and has now started her own business.  She left Kosovo in  very
    difficult circumstances at a young age and would find it  difficult  to
    return.

72. We accept that her circumstances would be affected were she to have  to
    give up work in the caf� owing to having to care  for  the  appellant's
    mother.  We accept her evidence  that  it  would  not  be  economically
    viable for her to employ somebody else to  run  the  caf�,  nor  do  we
    expect that her daughter, Tarzana, would  be  able  to  do  so  on  her
    behalf.  We note Mr Georget's submission that the appellant's wife  was
    severely affected on  the  last  occasion  but  we  consider  that  the
    situation she faces now was different.  Her daughters  are  now  adults
    and reasonably well settled, Tanja now being in a relationship  with  a
    partner and living away from the family home.  The son is  now  16  and
    reasonably well settled at school.  The  situation  is  different  from
    2019 and, we are not satisfied that the effect of  deportation  on  the
    appellant's wife's mental health would be  such  as  would  in  and  of
    itself make deportation unduly harsh upon her.

73. The extent to which she would be compelled to give up her caf� which we
    accept would be difficult depends on the extent  to  which  she   alone
    would need to meet the caring needs of the mother-in-law currently  met
    by the appellant.

74. As Mr Thomann submitted, there is no assessment from any doctor  as  to
    the necessary care that  the  mother-in-law  requires  although  we  do
    accept that she does require a carer given the award to her of DLA.  We
    note from the material before us that  the  appellant's  mother  had  a
    stroke and that she is in receipt of disability living  allowance.   We
    note also the evidence that following her stroke she was bedridden  and
    has to be fed, bathed, changed and dressed.  That was  previously  done
    by the appellant's wife and is now done by the  appellant.   We  accept
    also that she is anxious as a result of the attack on her,  a  burglary
    in which she was stabbed, and we have no reason to doubt that she  does
    not like being on her own and requires assurance to the extent  that  a
    member of the family has to be there overnight with her.   We  do  not,
    however, have any medical evidence in  relation  to  the  mother-in-law
    from, for example, her GP of anything more recent than 12  April  2019.
    That letter states only as follows:-

         "She unfortunately suffered a stroke in Jan 2017 which has left her
         paralysed on the left side and unable  to  mobilise  independently.
         She needs support with all her activities of daily living including
         feeding, washing, moving around, etc.

         Her main support is her son and daughter-in-law  who  provide  care
         for all her  daily  activities  as  above  and  also  take  her  to
         appointments at the surgery, gym, hospital, etc.

         In September 2018 she was burgled and assaulted at home  which  has
         left her traumatised and  often  anxious/scared.   Her  family  are
         supporting her with this".

75. Having found that the appellant does provide most of the care  for  his
    mother every day, we note also his evidence that if his appeal were  to
    be allowed,  he  would  seek  employment.   He  does  not  provide  any
    explanation as to who would then care for his mother and that  position
    is inconsistent either with his wife not being in a position to give up
    her caf� to look after the mother-in-law or in  Social  Services  being
    able to provide for the mother which leads us  to  conclude  that  this
    aspect of the appeal has been exaggerated  We do, however,  accept  the
    evidence from the appellant and his wife that  she  is  mistrustful  of
    strangers, this  being  confirmed  by  the  medical  evidence  and   is
    understandable given what has happened to her and  the  nature  of  her
    disability.

76. We are not satisfied that the appellant's wife would need  to  give  up
    the caf�, as we are not  satisfied  that  the  family  would  not  pull
    together, or  that  they  would  not  receive  assistance  from  Social
    Services to care for the mother, given that the appellant has said that
    he would look for and presumably  take,  work.  That  would  inevitably
    diminish the care he gives her.

77. Although she is mistrustful of strangers, it is  reasonable  to  expect
    the Appellant's mother to come to grips with receiving care from people
    outside the family unit in the way that many other elderly  and  infirm
    people are required to accept.  It is  legitimate  to  assume,  in  the
    absence  of  evidence  to  the  contrary,  that  social  services  will
    discharge its obligations to the appellant's  mother:  BL  (Jamaica)  v
    SSHD [2016] EWCA Civ 357.  There will be a transitional period in which
    care arrangements will need to undergo radical revision.  That will  be
    unsettling for the appellant's mother and for the family  more  widely.
    But it is not shown that those adjustments  will  have  the  'knock-on'
    consequences contended for by Mr Georget.  The  appellant's  wife  will
    not have to give up the caf�.  She and Tarzana will not find themselves
    out of work as a result, and there will  not  be  a  serious  financial
    impact on the family.

78. We accept that it would not be possible for the appellant  to  maintain
    any meaningful relationship with his mother given  her  disability  and
    given also the evidence in the social worker report that she is  unable
    to fly.  That is for health reasons.  We accept also that  that  would,
    inevitably, cause her distress which would impact  on  the  appellant's
    wife and his son as well as the older children.  We consider that it is
    most likely to affect the wife given  that  it  is  likely  the  caring
    responsibilities would once again fall to her.

79. We accept that the appellant and his son are very close and that as the
    son says, the appellant is the glue that keeps the family together.  We
    accept that they have to an extent made up for the six lost years  when
    the appellant was in prison and that it is  a  critical  time  for  the
    appellant's son as he is facing exams and support of the  father  would
    be important to his future.

80. In assessing the effect on the son, we bear in mind that there  has  to
    be an individuated case specific assessment of him as  required  by  HA
    (Iraq).

81. The son is now 16 and is approaching the end of his time at school.  We
    accept that he needs guidance and support  of  a  father  which  he  is
    receiving on a daily basis, and whilst we accept that occasional visits
    and electronic communication would not replace the bond, it nonetheless
    given his age could maintain it to a  significant  degree.   We  accept
    that the son was damaged by the  separation  from  his  father  and  we
    accept that he may be affected also by the effect of deportation of his
    father on his mother, grandmother and sisters.  But his sisters are now
    adults and one of them has moved away from home.

82. Viewing all his circumstances and taking  matters  in  the  round,  and
    making the necessary individuated assessment, we are not satisfied that
    the effect on the son would, although harsh, be unduly harsh given  the
    high threshold involved.

83. Similarly, even assuming that the appellant's wife would have  to  give
    up her business, and that there would be  a  significant  reduction  in
    their household's income, this is due as much to the  mother's  refusal
    to have support from outside the family as anything else.  She  is  not
    compelled, except perhaps emotionally and morally, to  look  after  her
    mother-in-law and again, taking all of these factors  into  account  we
    are not satisfied that the effect of  deportation  on  the  appellant's
    wife would be unduly harsh.

84. Turning then to the  appellant's  private  life,  we  accept  that  the
    appellant has lived in the United Kingdom since 19, and we accept  that
    he has to an extent integrated into life in  the  United  Kingdom.   We
    accept also that he left Kosovo in traumatic circumstances and that the
    country to which he would be returning  is  very  different  from  that
    which  he  left.    The  appellant  was  sentenced  to  twelve   years'
    imprisonment, an indicator of the seriousness of his  crime.   Further,
    as is evident from the sentencing remarks of the judge, we note that he
    was convicted of smuggling  3.97  kilos  of  cocaine  into  the  United
    Kingdom.  The sentencing judge  noted  that  he  was  involved  in  the
    planning and that he had done this for financial gain.   As  the  judge
    noted:-

         "Class A drugs as has often been said, are  a  curse.   They  cause
         untold misery to those who have become addicted to them and to  the
         families and loved ones of addicts.  And, of course,  they  are  at
         the root of a great deal of crime, often violent crimes."

85. We consider that a conviction for a crime of this nature is  such  that
    the appellant has extinguished his social and integrative ties  to  the
    United Kingdom.   Further,  we  do  not  accept  that  there  would  be
    obstacles to the appellant reintegrating  into  life  in  Kosovo  which
    could not with a degree of difficulty be overcome. He would on arrival,
    we accept, be an outsider, but he speaks the language and he has skills
    including  qualifications  in  carpentry.   It  would,  no  doubt,   be
    difficult to reintegrate but that is not a sufficient basis on which it
    is said that  there  are  very  significant  obstacles  such  that  the
    relevant test is met.  We accept that he has no close  family  ties  to
    Kosovo but  equally  we  are  not  satisfied  that  he  would  find  it
    impossible to re-establish himself to the extent that he could be  seen
    as an insider.  This is not comparable to a situation in which  someone
    left a country at a very young age.

86. We turn next to an assessment of the public interest.  We consider that
    the public interest in deporting this appellant is very strong  indeed,
    not just because of the protection from  offending  but  in  the  wider
    terms of deterrence and in the public confidence somebody  given  leave
    here should be deported if they commit a crime  of  such  gravity.   We
    accept that the appellant has not been convicted of  any  crimes  since
    the index offence but that is not in our  view  any  strong  indication
    that he has become rehabilitated or indeed that anything other  than  a
    marginal amount of weight should be attached to that.  The  offence  he
    committed was one that  involved  preplanning  for  gain  and  we  find
    nowhere in his evidence any proper or sufficient explanation for why he
    did so.  We therefore attach little weight to the fact that he has  not
    been convicted in the time since the index conviction.  We accept  that
    he regrets what he did and some little weight can be attached to that.

87. In favour of the appellant we do note that the effect on his  son,  and
    wife, will be significant and harsh although, for the reasons  we  have
    given above, they do not amount to undue  harshness.   We  accept  also
    that there will be a significant impact on the appellant's  mother  who
    will inevitably be distressed at him being  removed.   That  that  will
    have the effect of severing their relationship and we accept that  that
    is a relationship which amounts to family  life  given  the  degree  of
    dependency.

88. We do not accept that the effect on the daughters  will  be  so  severe
    given that they are  both  now  adults  and  Tanja  has  now  formed  a
    relationship and lives with her partner, albeit that she remains  close
    to the family.

89. On any view there will be a significant and adverse impact on the close
    family but the children are now older and will be able to an extent  to
    assist their mother emotionally and practically and to provide her real
    support and assistance.  The appellant will be returning to Kosovo as a
    relatively young man with skills which he would appear to  be  able  to
    transfer.

90. Taking the effects of deportation of the appellant cumulatively and how
    they will impact on the family unit as a whole, we have no  doubt  that
    the effects will be harsh.   But  in  this  case  the  gravity  of  the
    offending is of an order of an entirely different  magnitude  from  the
    four-year cut-off.   Indeed,  the  sentence  is  of  three  times  that
    duration  reflecting  the  gravity  of  the  offending  which  in  turn
    increases the public interest in deportation as does the nature of  the
    crime - the importation of significant quantities of Class A drugs.

91. In conclusion, although we accept that the effects  of  deportation  in
    this case will be harsh  on  the  family  and  indeed  distressing,  we
    consider that given the gravity of the appellant's offending that it is
    nonetheless proportionate.

92. Accordingly, for these reasons, we dismiss the appeal on all grounds.

Notice of decision
