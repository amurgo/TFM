For the Respondent:    Mr T Wilding, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan whose date of birth is  recorded
    as 21st  April  1956.   On  3rd  September  2014  he  made  a  combined
    application for leave to remain in the  United  Kingdom  as  a  Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur)  Migrant  under  the  points-based  system  and  for   a
    biometric residence permit.  On 3rd November 2014 a decision  was  made
    to refuse the application and to remove him  from  the  United  Kingdom
    pursuant to Section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and  Nationality  Act
    2006.  He appealed requesting that the appeal be  dealt  with  "on  the
    papers". Accordingly on 13th February 2015 the matter was placed before
    Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Juss  who  having  considered  the
    evidence that was before him dismissed the appeal.   The  Statement  of
    Reasons is very brief.

 2. Not content with the decision of Judge Juss, by Notice dated 16th March
    2015 the Appellant made application for permission  to  appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal which on 4th May 2015 was granted by Judge of the  First
    Tier Tribunal McDade who suggested that the Judge  Juss  may  not  have
    given the anxious scrutiny to the appeal that it  required.   Thus  the
    matter comes before me.

 3. At the outset Mr Wilding maintained, in reliance upon the  Respondent's
    'Rule 24 Notice' that the  decision  of  Judge  Juss  was  sustainable.
    However, I am very grateful to Mr Patel for the very careful manner  in
    which he took both Mr Wilding and  me  through  the  various  documents
    which clearly had been submitted with  the  application  and  which  it
    would seem had, in some measure, been overlooked by the caseworker.

 4. The basis upon which the application was refused was that having regard
    to Appendix A  of  the  Immigration  Rules,  paragraph  41-SD  requires
    certain documents to be supplied with the application.   The  Secretary
    of State was not satisfied that the required documents had in fact been
    submitted.  In relation to 41-SD(e)(iii), being the first of  the  sub-
    Rules under Appendix A of which it was said the evidence was deficient,
    the Appellant was to provide, "one or more of the  following  specified
    documents covering  (either  together  or  individually)  a  continuous
    period commencing before 11th July 2014 up to  no  earlier  than  three
    month before  the date of the application:

          i) Advertising or  marketing  material,  including  printouts  of
             online  advertising  that  has  been  published   locally   or
             nationally, showing the applicant's name (and the names of the
             business if applicable) together with  the  business  activity
             or, where his business is trading online, confirmation of  his
             ownership of the domain name of the business's website,

         ii) Article(s) or online links to  article(s)  any  newspapers  or
             other publication showing the applicant's name (and  the  name
             of the business if  applicable)  together  with  the  business
             activity,

        iii) Information from a trade fair, which the applicant has  had  a
             stand or given  a presentation to market his business, showing
             the  applicant's  name  (and  the  name  of  the  business  if
             applicable) together with the business activity, or

         iv) Personal registration with a  UK  trade  body  linked  to  the
             applicant's occupation."

 5. I deal with this aspect of the case first because that is  the  way  in
    which Mr Patel presented  the  appeal.   At  pages  28  to  54  of  the
    Appellant's  bundle  there  was  documentation  which  was  capable  of
    satisfying the advertising and marketing material requirement but it is
    conceded by Mr  Patel,  quite  properly,  that  what  was  lacking  was
    evidence that that material  covered  a  continuous  period  commencing
    before 11th July 2014.  In those circumstances the Secretary  of  State
    in  considering  that  evidence  was  quite  right  in   refusing   the
    application but what was required was only one or more of the specified
    documents; it was not that the Appellant was to provide one of each  of
    1 to 4.

 6. At page 60 of the Appellant's bundle was a certificate awarded  to  the
    Appellant by the  Chartered  Management  Institute  as  well  as  other
    documents following to page 62.  Those meets the  requirements  of  the
    personal registration with a UK trade body linked  to  the  applicant's
    occupation.  Mr Wilding accepted that that was the case and so  insofar
    as the Secretary of  State  in  the  first  instance  had  refused  the
    application because 41-SD(e)(iii) had not been met she was wrong to  do
    so.

 7. Moving on then, to 41-SD(e)(iv) the Appellant was required  to  provide
    "one or more of the following documents  showing  trading,  which  must
    cover (either together or individually) a continuous period  commencing
    before 11th July 2014 up to no earlier than  three  months  before  the
    date of his application:

          i) One or more contracts for service. If a  contract  is  not  an
             original the applicant must sign  each  page.   Each  contract
             must show

               a) The applicant's name and the name of the business

               b) The service provided by the applicant's business

               c) The name of the other party or  parties  involved  in  the
                  contract and their contact details, including  their  full
                  address, postal code and, where available, landline  phone
                  number and any email address; and

               d) The duration of the contract; or

         ii) One or more  original  letters  from  UK  regulated  financial
             institutions with which the  applicant  has  a  business  bank
             account, and the institution's headed  paper,  confirming  the
             dates the business was trading during the period  referred  to
             at (iv) above. ..."

 8. As with (d) these are alternatives; clearly so because  the  word  "or"
    appears after the penultimate requirement.

 9. Mr Patel took me to the agreements which are to be found at page 63  of
    the bundle and 68.  There is  also  a  bank  letter  from  the  Trustee
    Savings Bank dated 2nd September 2014 together with the statement which
    followed.  Mr Patel sought to persuade me that  the  bank  letter  read
    together with the application form at page 33  was  sufficient  because
    the application form did not suggest that it was necessary to state the
    date the business was trading during the period referred to.   Although
    I am against him on that  point,  because  it  seems  to  me  that  the
    application form must be read together with the Immigration Rules, that
    Is not material in this case because the Appellant was only required to
    provide one or more of the documents and in this case he  had  provided
    the contact. it would seem that the Secretary of State  had  overlooked
    the relevant documents and so too the Judge Juss.

10. It follows that Judge Juss made a material error  of  law  because  the
    various documents were supplied with the application; there is no issue
    about this. In the circumstances the requirements of the Rules were met
    and the appeal ought to have allowed.

11. In these circumstances I set  aside  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and remake it, finding as  I  do  that  there  was  sufficient
    evidence provided with the application by the Appellant to meet each of
    the requirements with which the Secretary of State took issue therefore
    in remaking the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  the  appeal  is
    allowed.

Decision

The Appellant's appeal to the Upper Tribunal is  allowed.  The  decision  of
the First tier Tribunal is set aside and remade such that the appeal in  the
First tier Tribunal is allowed.

Fee Award

The Appellant invited the Tribunal to deal with the matter  on  the  papers.
He had supplied the correct  documentation  with  the  application  and  the
various documents were also before the judge.  He  had  done  all  that  was
required of him and in those circumstances it seems to me right  and  proper
that a full fee award in the sum of ï¿½80 should be made in this case.
