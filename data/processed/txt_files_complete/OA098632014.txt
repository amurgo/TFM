Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Kandola, Senior Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr H Kannangara, instructed by Anglo Chinese Law
Firm Limited

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Entry Clearance Officer, with permission, appeals the  decision  of
    the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Thanki),  who  in  a   determination
    promulgated on  28th  October  2015  allowed  the  Respondent's  appeal
    against the decision of the Entry Clearance Officer made on 8th  August
    2014 refusing her application for entry clearance as  a  partner  under
    Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.

 2. Whilst the Entry Clearance  Officer  is  the  Appellant,  for  ease  of
    reference, I intend to refer to the parties as  they  were  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

Background:

 3. The Appellant applied for entry clearance as a partner  under  Appendix
    FM  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   Within  the  application,  she  made
    reference to her marriage in  April  2013  and  that  her  Sponsor  and
    husband was working in the UK with an annual income of �18,720.

 4. Accompanying that application were  a  number  of  documents  including
    seven months of payslips, bank statements and an  employment  contract.
    The letter accompanying the application is set out in the  Respondent's
    bundle at pages 27 and 28 and is dated 29th April 2014.  On the  second
    page of that letter it sets out the documents that  were  submitted  in
    support of the application.  It does not make any reference  to  a  P60
    being provided.

 5. On the  8th  August  2014  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  refused  the
    application.

 6.  The  following  reasons  were  given.   The  Entry  Clearance  Officer
    considered the application under paragraph EC-P.1.1 of Appendix  FM  of
    the Immigration  Rules.   He  found  that  the  suitability  for  entry
    clearance requirements was met as were the  relationship  requirements.
    However as to the financial requirements, as defined  in  paragraph  E-
    ECP.3.3, the Entry Clearance Officer found that  the  Sponsor  was  not
    exempt from the financial requirements and that in order to meet  them,
    the Sponsor needed a gross income of at least �18,600 per  annum.   The
    decision letter went on to state:-

         "You have stated on Appendix 2 (VAF 4A) that you met the  financial
         requirements on income from salaried employment in the UK, category
         A.  You have stated your Sponsor is employed ... since 1st  January
         2013 with an annual salary of �18,720.  ...

         As evidence of your  Sponsor's  employment  you  have  submitted  a
         document  entitled  conditions  of  employment  which  states  your
         Sponsor's salary is �360 gross weekly.  You  have  submitted  seven
         monthly wage slips from your Sponsor (October 2013 -  April  2014).
         I note that your Sponsor's terms  and  conditions  state  that  the
         frequency of wage payments is weekly and not monthly  as  the  wage
         slips indicate.  You have submitted  personal  bank  statements  in
         your Sponsor's name covering 30/9/2013 -  8/4/2014.   I  note  that
         these bank statements do not show your Sponsor's salary being  paid
         in.  In light of this I am  not  satisfied  that  your  Sponsor  is
         earning at least  �18,600  per  annum.   I  therefore  refuse  your
         application under paragraph EC-P.1.1 (d)  of  Appendix  FM  of  the
         Immigration Rules.

         You have not provided personal bank statements corresponding to the
         same period as your Sponsor's payslips showing that the  salary  is
         being paid into his account.  These documents are specified in  our
         guidance and must be provided.  You  have  failed  to  provide  the
         specified documents of  your  Sponsor's  employment.   I  therefore
         refuse your application under paragraph EC-P.1.1(d) of Appendix  FM
         of the Immigration Rules (E-ECP.3.1)."

    The Entry Clearance  Officer  also  found  that  the  English  language
    requirement was met.

 7. The Appellant sought a review from the Entry Clearance Officer and  the
    grounds of the review made reference to the salary and how it was  paid
    to the Sponsor, namely that the payslips were issued at the interval of
    either three or four weeks and that as evidence of  his  earnings  into
    his bank account, the employer had taken charge of the  bank  documents
    and that the wages were paid into the Sponsor's bank account from  time
    to time.  A letter of confirmation from the employer  was  said  to  be
    enclosed with the Notice of Appeal.

 8. The Entry Clearance Manager conducted a review on  13th  January  2015.
    The review considered the Grounds of Appeal and the assertion that  the
    payslips showed that he was paid weekly.  The Entry  Clearance  Manager
    considered it was not clear on what basis the assertion was made as the
    payslips were dated monthly (or every four weeks). Further, the  salary
    disclosed in each payslip was  the  cumulative  total  for  the  entire
    monthly period.  Thus the payslips indicated a monthly  salary  payment
    and not  a  weekly  payment.   The  Entry  Clearance  Manager  was  not
    satisfied with the explanation given by the Sponsor as to  how  he  was
    paid noting that there was no evidence to support it  and  irrespective
    of that, the bank statements did  not  disclose  the  Sponsor's  salary
    deposits and that the personal bank  statements  corresponding  to  the
    same period of the payslips did not show the salary had been paid  into
    the account in the Sponsor's name.

 9.  The Entry Clearance Manager noted that the personal bank statement was
    a specified document and that the submission was "mandatory  under  the
    Rules and cannot be disregarded".  The Manager went on  to  state  that
    "In order for the gross income to be counted, the full net cash  amount
    must be paid into the bank account.  If the  full  net  amount  is  not
    deposited, only the amount that has been paid into  bank  account  will
    the counted towards the threshold".  Thus the Entry  Clearance  Manager
    was not satisfied on the basis  of  the  evidence  submitted  that  the
    Respondent had submitted all the specified documentation to demonstrate
    that her Sponsor could meet the income threshold under Appendix FM.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal:

10. The appeal came before the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Thanki)  on  14th
    October 2015.  The judge had the opportunity to hear  the  evidence  of
    the Sponsor and for that to be the subject of cross-examination.  At  a
    previous appeal, which had been adjourned, his employer had attended to
    give evidence on his behalf but that hearing had been adjourned  as  an
    interpreter had not been present.   He  could  not  attend  the  appeal
    before Judge Thanki but had made a statement (see paragraph 20).

11.  The judge's findings and conclusions are set out at paragraphs 20 - 34
    of his  decision.  The judge recorded that there were no concerns as to
    the Respondent's suitability to enter the UK and that the  relationship
    of the Respondent and the Sponsor was accepted and there  was  evidence
    to demonstrate that she could meet the  English  language  requirement.
    Thus he identified the sole issue was whether the  Sponsor  could  meet
    the financial requirements of a gross income of �18,600.

12. At paragraph [30] the judge made a finding that the Sponsor worked  for
    a restaurant, relying on the statement of the  manager  confirming  his
    role and confirmation of his work there since 2013 and that his  salary
    was �360 per week.  The judge at [30] set  out  the  Sponsor's  account
    supported by that document that he was paid in cash every three to four
    weeks and that as a result of personal difficulties the director of the
    company took over his financial matters and that his bank  account  was
    provided with deposits by Mr Q who had provided  a  witness  statement.
    He confirmed that he retained the Sponsor's bank card and  cheque  book
    so that the Sponsor could not access his  bank  account  and  would  be
    given �50 in cash each week for personal expenses.  He  confirmed  that
    the Sponsor's wages were paid into  his  bank  account  "from  time  to
    time".

13.  The judge went on to find at [31] the following:-

         "31. Notwithstanding the issues about the  payslips  and  the  bank
             deposits, I find from AB-51 that the P60 for the tax  year  to
             5th April 2015 shows the Sponsor's gross income as �18,792.74.
              I give significant weight to the document as it  is  an  HMRC
             document.  I accept from the evidence before me that  although
             the payslips may be given to the Appellant on a monthly basis,
             it reflects his salary on a weekly basis.  The  payslips  show
             income tax deducted and the national insurance paid.  I accept
             that the money that the Sponsor is entitled to  is  paid  into
             his bank account on an 'as and when' basis.

         32.  I find from  the  evidence  before  me  that  apart  from  the
             evidence of the Appellant's gross income, there is evidence to
             the  requisite  standard  that  he  pays  tax   and   national
             insurance.

         33.  I find that the Appellant has shown  that  the  Sponsor  earns
             �18,600 so as to satisfy the requirements of  the  Immigration
             Rules and her appeal succeeds."

14. The Entry Clearance Officer sought permission to appeal  that  decision
    and permission was granted on 18th April 2016.

The appeal before the Upper Tribunal:

15. Thus the appeal came before the Upper Tribunal to consider whether  the
    First-tier Tribunal decision involved the making of an error on a point
    of law.  Mr Kandola appeared on behalf of the Secretary  of  State  and
    relied upon the grounds.  He relied upon the  written  grounds  and  in
    particular  that  the  Sponsor  was  not  exempt  from  the   financial
    requirements as defined in paragraph E-ECP.3.3 and that he  would  have
    to demonstrate a gross income  of  at  least  �18,600  per  annum.   He
    further submitted that the Appellant could only rely on  the  Sponsor's
    income which was demonstrated by the specified  evidence  contained  in
    Appendix FM-SE.

16.  At [18] the First-tier Tribunal had regard to the  Sponsor's  evidence
    that he received part of his wages in cash,  �50  per  month.   However
    only wages paid into the bank account and appearing on  the  statements
    could be counted towards the Sponsor's gross income in accordance  with
    the evidence of financial requirements 1(n) of Appendix FM-SE.

17. He further submitted that it was not open to the judge to draw his  own
    conclusions based on the credibility of the Sponsor or other  documents
    in the absence of the specified documents.  In particular, the  judge's
    finding that the requirements were met because a P60 showed the Sponsor
    had earned �18,792 could not be relied upon and that the  �50  paid  in
    cash should be discounted and therefore the Sponsor's income could only
    be considered to be �18,192.

18. In his oral submissions he submitted that the Sponsor  could  not  show
    that the entirety of the salary was deposited  into  the  account.   He
    made reference to  the  bank  statements  within  the  bundle  and  the
    corresponding  payslips  and  by  way  of  example  for  February  2014
    demonstrated that only �580 was credited to the  account  although  the
    net pay for that month was �1,196.  Thus he submitted the judge had  to
    accept that he could not meet the Rules as he could not show  that  the
    corresponding bank statements which  were  mandatory  demonstrated  the
    salary payment.  He submitted the judge could not allow the  appeal  on
    the basis of the P60 and that it could not be  determinative  and  that
    the �50 cash that he was given would  have  to  be  deducted  from  the
    amount which gave the figure of  �18,192.74.   He  submitted  therefore
    that none of the cash income went into the account and  the  difference
    between what went in to the bank account as opposed to the  wage  slips
    could not be evidenced and thus he fell below the threshold.

19. Mr Kannangara made submissions on behalf of the Respondent.  There  had
    been no Rule 24 response setting out any contrary argument and  in  his
    submissions, Mr Kannangara raised an entirely new point.  He began  his
    submissions by making the observation that the judge had  accepted  the
    Sponsor's account and the explanation as to why he was paid weekly when
    the payslips had said monthly (paragraphs [30] and [31]).   He  further
    accepted that there was no corresponding amount going into the  account
    to reflect the net amount.  The judge accepted that  the  employer  was
    controlling the account.

20. As to the specified documents, he submitted that it was  not  fatal  to
    the outcome and made submissions relating to Appendix FM-SE 2A(i) which
    made reference to the ability  to  rely  upon  a  P60  in  addition  to
    payslips and the bank statements.  In  essence,  his  submissions  were
    that a P60 in addition to an employment contract and payslips and  bank
    statements were  sufficient  to  satisfy  the  Rules  when  considering
    paragraph 2A(i) of Appendix FM-SE and that whilst the judge had made no
    reference to this, it would demonstrate  that  there  was  no  material
    error.

21. For his part Mr Kandola observed that the judge had made  no  reference
    to paragraph 2A(i) of Appendix FM-SE and was not on notice that such  a
    submission was to be raised.  However, when considering the  particular
    paragraph he submitted that it did not save the application.

22. Both advocates submitted that there did not  appear  to  be  any  legal
    authority dealing with this point and  neither  advocate  had  provided
    copies of any relevant IDIs or guidance relevant  to  this  issue.   In
    those  circumstances,  I  directed  the  parties  to  provide   written
    submissions and gave  directions  to  the  parties  as  to  when  those
    directions   should   be   complied   with,   that   the    Appellant's
    representatives would file and serve written submissions by 4  p.m.  on
    7th June and that the Appellant's should provide written submissions by
    way of reply (including copies of any IDIs and policy documents  relied
    on) by 21st June 2016.   Mr  Kannangara  provided  his  submissions  in
    accordance with the directions.  There was no compliance on  behalf  of
    the Respondent  in respect of  those  directions.  However  in  further
    communications  between  the  Tribunal  and  the  Presenting  Unit,  it
    appeared that the date of the written submissions had  been  overlooked
    due to an administrative oversight and were filed  and  served  on  the
    28th July 2016.

The submissions:

23. I shall therefore set out a summary of the written submissions made  on
    behalf of the Appellant.

24.   It is submitted that paragraph 2A of Appendix FM-SE was  relevant  to
    the outcome of the appeal and  therefore,  whilst  the  judge  made  no
    reference to this, the decision reached was open to the Tribunal and no
    error of law can be demonstrated.

25. Paragraph 2A(i) of Appendix FM-SE is as follows:
         "2A. (i) In respect of salaried employment in the UK  (paragraph  2
         of this Appendix), statutory or contractual  maternity,  paternity,
         adoption or sick pay in the UK (paragraph 5 or 6 of this Appendix),
         or a director's salary paid to a self-employed person (paragraph  9
         of this Appendix), the applicant may, in addition to  the  payslips
         and personal bank statements required under that paragraph,  submit
         the P60 for the relevant  period  of  employment  relied  upon  (if
         issued).  If they do not, the Entry Clearance Officer or  Secretary
         of State may grant the application if otherwise satisfied that  the
         requirements of this Appendix relating to that employment are  met.
         The Entry Clearance Officer or Secretary of State may request  that
         the applicant submit the document in accordance with paragraph D of
         this Appendix."

26. Thus it is submitted that the wording  of  the  paragraph  demonstrated
    that in respect of salaried employment in the UK, the  applicant,  may,
    in addition to payslips and personal bank statements required under the
    paragraph, submit a P60 for the relevant period  of  employment  relied
    upon (if  issued).   It  is  therefore  submitted  that  the  paragraph
    demonstrates that the applicant can submit the P60 in addition  to  the
    payslips and bank statements.  As this  was  salaried  employment,  the
    specified evidence required was an employment letter, payslips and bank
    statements.  It is therefore submitted  that  if  the  above  specified
    evidence was submitted then an applicant did not have to provide  extra
    documents to provide the salaried income.

27.  Therefore it suggests that the Secretary of State must  have  intended
    to allow the use of a P60 and the  employment  contract  (according  to
    paragraph 2A (ii)) as documents showing the relevant  income  when  the
    specified evidence although submitted, failed to show it clearly.

28.   It is submitted that the use of  the  phrase  "in  addition"  in  the
    paragraph suggested that the P60 and/or employment contract can only be
    relied upon when the payslip and bank statements are  submitted.   When
    applied to the particular facts of this case, the Respondent  submitted
    the payslips and the bank statements.  In addition, she also  submitted
    a P60 and employment contract.  As  she  had  submitted  the  specified
    evidence, she could rely on the P60 and thus it was consistent with the
    interpretation of paragraph 2A of Appendix FM-SE.

29. As the First-tier Tribunal Judge accepted the Respondent's husband  was
    working and that he earned an annual  salary  of  �18,792  that  was  a
    finding open to the judge which was unchallenged by the Entry Clearance
    Officer.  The issue related to the specified evidence.

30. The written submissions then deal with the next issue which was whether
    it is the discretion of the Entry Clearance Officer to grant  leave  to
    enter  in  such  circumstances.   At  paragraph  [10]  of  the  written
    submissions it is submitted  that  there  is  no  discretion  when  the
    Respondent had submitted payslips, bank statements and a P60.  In  such
    circumstances the requirements of the Rules have been met.

31. As regards the discretion of the Entry Clearance Officer, it is set out
    in the rest of paragraph 2A (i) of Appendix FM-SE.  It can be read as:-

         "... If they do not, the Entry Clearance Officer  or  Secretary  of
         State may grant the application if  otherwise  satisfied  that  the
         requirements of this Appendix relating to that employment are  met.
         The Entry Clearance Officer or Secretary of State may request  that
         the applicant submit the document in accordance with paragraph D of
         this Appendix."

32. The written submissions therefore submit that it  is  clear  that  that
    part of the paragraph gives discretion to the Entry  Clearance  Officer
    or Secretary of State to grant leave to enter or remain  "if  otherwise
    satisfied  that  the  requirements  of  this  Appendix  are  met".   If
    discretion was not used to grant entry clearance  or  leave  to  remain
    then the Entry Clearance Officer or Secretary  of  State  will  have  a
    further discretion to apply evidential flexibility.  That is to request
    the applicant to submit documents in accordance with paragraph D of the
    Appendix.  Thus it is submitted that the First-tier Tribunal Judge  did
    not err in law by allowing the appeal by taking into account the P60 of
    the Respondent's husband.

33. The written submissions also  submit  that  there  are  no  Immigration
    Directorate Instructions which provides specific guidance on this issue
    other than repeating paragraph 2A of Appendix FM-SE.

34. The submissions on behalf of the respondent can also be summarised.  Mr
    Kandola submits that is clear from the wording of the paragraph 2A  (i)
    that the submission of a P60 is "in addition" to wage  slips  and  bank
    statements which satisfy Appendix FM-SE. It is not in addition to  wage
    slips which disclose a salary less than the annual income required,  or
    bank statements which do not show corresponding deposits of the  wages.
    The  appellant  fails  in  both  respects  because  he  can  only  show
    �18,192.74 that is compliant with Appendix FM-SE  -  the  shortfall  is
    covered by cash payments  which  are  not  compliant  with  the  Rules.
    Therefore paragraph 2A (i) does not dispense with the requirement  that
    wages and bank statements have to be Appendix FM-SE compliant.

35. He further submits that neither a literal or purposive construction  of
    the Rule supports the  appellant's  contention  that  "the  P60  and/or
    employment contract can only be relied upon when the payslips and  bank
    statements are submitted." (Paragraph 7 of appellant's submissions).

36. Whilst it has been argued by  the  appellant  that  the  SSHD  has  not
    challenged the annual income the appellant receives, that is  incorrect
    because the SSHD challenged the Rules compliant amount and that it fell
    below the prescribed amount at paragraphs 4 and 5 of her grounds:-
      4. The Appellant may only rely on the Sponsor's income which is
      demonstrated by specified evidence, contained in Appendix FM-SE.  At
      [18] the Judge has regard to the Sponsor's evidence that he receives
      part of his wages in cash, �50 per month.  It is submitted that only
      wages paid into a bank account and appearing on the statements may be
      counted towards the Sponsor's gross income in accordance with Evidence
      of Financial Requirements 1 (n) of Appendix FM-SE:


    (n) The gross amount of any cash income may be counted where the
    person's specified bank statements show the net amount which relates to
    the gross amount shown on their payslips (or in the relevant specified
    evidence provided in addition to the specified bank statements in
    relation to non-employment income). Otherwise, only the net amount
    shown on the specified bank statements may be counted.


      5. The Judge notes at [8] 'the statements provided do not match the
      salary deposits.' And notes the Respondent's position that the full
      net cash amount must be paid onto the bank account. However, it is not
      open to the Judge to draw his own conclusions based on the credibility
      of the Sponsor or other documents in the absence of those specified.
      The Judge makes a finding that the requirement is met because the P60
      shows that Sponsor has earned �18,792.74, but the �50 paid in cash per
      month must be discounted, therefore the Sponsor's income can only be
      considered to be �18,192.74.


37. As to the issue of discretion and that the ECO can grant the
    application if a P60 has been submitted, paragraph 2A(i) talks about
    discretion if a P60 has not been submitted - as such it does not assist
    the appellant because he is relying on a P60 to save him from the
    strict requirements of the Rules. Neither does discretion under
    evidential flexibility stated at (Appendix FM-SE paragraph D) assist
    the appellant because this is not a case of missing documents from a
    sequence or series of documents - the appellant fails to meet the
    requirements of the Rules as a matter of fact rather than because of a
    failure to produce the right documents.

The legislative framework:

38. The Rules in force  at  the  relevant  time  are  reproduced  below  as
    follows:
Appendix FM-SE - Family members - specified evidence
Family Members - Specified Evidence


1. This Appendix sets out the specified evidence applicants need to provide
to meet the requirements of rules contained in Appendix FM and, where those
requirements are also contained in other rules, including Appendix Armed
Forces, and unless otherwise stated, the specified evidence applicants need
to provide to meet the requirements of those rules.

2. Where evidence is not specified by Appendix FM, but is of a type  covered
by this Appendix, the requirements of this Appendix shall apply.

3. In this Appendix references to  paragraphs  are  to  paragraphs  of  this
Appendix unless the context otherwise requires.

4. (a) In deciding an application in relation to which this Appendix states
that specified documents must be provided, the Entry Clearance Officer or
Secretary of State ("the decision-maker") will consider documents that have
been submitted with the application, and will only consider documents
submitted after the application where sub-paragraph (b) or (e) applies.

5. If the applicant:

        g) Has submitted:

              i. A sequence of documents and some of the  documents  in  the
                 sequence have been omitted (e.g. if one bank statement from
                 a series is missing);

             ii. A document in the wrong format (for example, if a letter is
                 not on letterhead paper as specified); or

            iii. A document that is a copy and not an original document; or

             iv. A document which does not  contain  all  of  the  specified
                 information; or

      (ii) Has not submitted a specified document,

the decision-maker may contact  the  applicant  or  his  representative  in
writing  or  otherwise,  and  request  the  document(s)  or   the   correct
version(s).  The  material  requested  must  be  received  at  the  address
specified in the request within a reasonable  timescale  specified  in  the
request.

1) The decision-maker will not request documents where he or she does not
anticipate that addressing the error or omission referred to in sub-
paragraph (b) will lead to a grant because the application will be refused
for other reasons.

2) If the applicant has submitted:

     1. A document in the wrong format; or

     2. A document that is a copy and not an original document, or

   3. A document that does not contain all of the specified information, but
      the missing information is verifiable from:

           1. other documents submitted with the application,

           i) the website of the organisation which issued the document, or



          ii) the website of the appropriate regulatory body,

the application may be granted exceptionally, providing the decision-maker
is satisfied that the document(s) is genuine and that the applicant meets
the requirement to which the document relates. The decision-maker reserves
the right to request the specified original document(s) in the correct
format in all cases where sub-paragraph (b) applies, and to refuse
applications if this material is not provided as set out in sub-paragraph
(b).

1) Where the decision-maker is satisfied that there is a valid reason why a
specified document(s) cannot be supplied, e.g. because it is not issued in
a particular country or has been permanently lost, he or she may exercise
discretion not to apply the requirement for the document(s) or to request
alternative or additional information or document(s) be submitted by the
applicant.

2) Before making a decision under Appendix FM or this Appendix, the
decision-maker may contact the applicant or their representative in writing
or otherwise to request further information or documents. The material
requested must be received at the address specified in the request within a
reasonable timescale specified in the request.

           person has been employed by their current employer for at least
           6 months (and where paragraph 13(b) of this Appendix does not
           apply); or

        1. any period of salaried employment in the period of 12 months
           prior to the date of application if the person has been employed
           by their current employer for less than 6 months (or at least 6
           months but the person does not rely on paragraph 13(a) of this
           Appendix), or in the financial year(s) relied upon by a self-
           employed person.

      1. A letter from the employer(s) who issued the payslips at  paragraph

           0. the person's employment and gross annual salary;

           1. the length of their employment;

        1. the period over which they have been or were paid the  level  of
           salary relied upon in the application; and

paid to a self-employed person (paragraph 9 of this Appendix), the
applicant may, in addition to the payslips and personal bank statements
required under that paragraph, submit the P60 for the relevant period(s) of
employment relied upon (if issued). If they do not, the Entry Clearance

employment are met. The Entry Clearance Officer or Secretary of State may
request that the applicant submit the document(s) in accordance with
paragraph D of this Appendix.

 iii) In respect of salaried employment in the UK (paragraph 2 of this
      Appendix), or statutory or contractual maternity, paternity, adoption
      or sick pay in the UK (paragraph 5 or 6 of this Appendix), the
      applicant may, in addition to the letter from the employer(s) required
      under that paragraph, submit a signed contract of employment. If they

      Appendix relating to that employment are met. The Entry Clearance
      Officer or Secretary of State may request that the applicant submit
      the document(s) in accordance with paragraph D of this Appendix....."

Discussion:

39. As reproduced above, Appendix FM-SE sets out the specified evidence an
    applicant need to provide to meet the requirements of the Rules. The
    First-tier Tribunal judge correctly identified that the sole issue was
    whether the sponsor could meet the financial requirements of a gross
    income of �18,600. In this regard the First-tier Tribunal judge found
    that the sponsor had worked for a restaurant since 2013 and had a net
    salary of �360 per week (based on the letter of employment).

40. It is plain for reading paragraph [31] that the basis of the refusal of
    entry clearance and the submissions made by the Presenting Officer were
    still live issues because as the documents identify, the sponsor's
    income had not been demonstrated by compliance with the specified
    evidence required by Appendix FM-SE. This remains the position advanced
    on behalf of the ECO before the Upper Tribunal and that the judge was
    wrong to place reliance on the P60 to demonstrate that the applicant
    met the Rules.

41. The evidence required to demonstrate income for salaried employment is
    specified in Appendix FM-SE, that is, payslips for the requisite
    period, the letter for the employer and the personal banks statements.
    The periods of the documents provided were from October 2013 - 4th
    April 2014(see monthly dated payslips in the applicant's bundle). The
    personal bank statements are required to correspond to the same period
    of the payslips to show that the salary has been paid into the account
    in the name of the person concerned.

42. However the bank statements provided by the sponsor do not comply with
    paragraph 1(c) as the bank statements do not show the salary being paid
    into the relevant account. By way of example, the payslip for February
    2014 period 11 shows a net figure of �1196 whereas the bank statements
    for the corresponding period show a deposit of �580.

43. Furthermore, the evidence provided by the applicant does not comply
    with paragraph 1(n) of Appendix FM-SE which states as follows:

    (n) The gross amount of any cash income may be counted where the
    person's specified bank statements show the net amount which relates to
    the gross amount shown on their payslips (or in the relevant specified
    evidence provided in addition to the specified bank statements in
    relation to non-employment income). Otherwise, only the net amount
    shown on the specified bank statements may be counted.


44. An examination of the evidence provided y the sponsor demonstrates that
    the bank statements do not match the salary deposits nor do the amounts
    set out in the payslips correspond with the bank deposits. Under
    paragraph 1 (n) the gross amount of any cash income may be counted
    where the person's specified bank statements show the deposit of the
    full net amount t which relates to the gross amount paid on the
    payslip. Here, the net amount deposited in the bank account does not
    equate to the gross amount as set out in the payslips.

45. The submissions advanced on behalf of the appellant do not appear to
    dispute that the payslips do not match the deposits in the account. His
    submission is that the Appellant can succeed by reference to paragraph
    2A (i) and the provision of the P60 provided by the sponsor.

46. However in my judgment, the wording of paragraph 2A(i) and in
    particular "in addition" demonstrates that the submission of the P60 is
    "in addition" to the salary slips and the bank statements in the format
    and with the specified content as set out in Appendix FM-SE is not "in
    addition" or in substitution for wage slips and bank statements which
    do not show the corresponding deposits of the salary as required by the
    Rules. I do not read the requirements of Paragraph 2A(i) to mean that
    an appellant is not required to comply with the earlier mandatory
    paragraphs of Appendix FM-SE.

47. The appellant could not demonstrate from the documents submitted that
    the full net amount was paid into the relevant personal account so that
    he could rely on the gross amount of income (as set out in the P60).
    The rationale behind the Rules is clear - it is for the ECO or the
    Secretary of State to judge on a clear and objective basis the level of
    income paid to the person concerned and that the requisite sum
    identified is available to support and maintain the family member who
    seeks entry clearance or leave to remain. I therefore do not consider
    that it was open to the judge to rely upon the P60 where the other
    evidence provided by the applicant was not compliant with the specified
    requirements of Appendix-FM-SE.

48. The nest issue relates to the discretion to be exercised by the ECO as
    set out in paragraph 2A (i). Mr Kananga submits that the Paragraph
    gives discretion to the ECO or the Secretary of State to grant leave to
    enter or remain "if otherwise satisfied that the requirements of the
    Appendix are met". However it is plain for reading the reasons given by
    the ECO for refusing the application that he was not "otherwise
    satisfied" that the requirements of Appendix FM-SE were satisfied for
    the reasons given. The ECO identified significant issues relevant to
    the content of the payslips and the bank statements. Also the documents
    that accompanied the application did not include the P60. Thus it could
    not properly be said that there was any reasons identified for the ECO
    to apply any discretion to waive the requirements.

49. Furthermore the Rule at [D] and reproduced above, does not assist the
    appellant as it is not a case where it could properly be said that this
    was a document omitted from a sequence, or in the wrong format or not
    an original document or even as set out at (dd) a document which does
    not contain all the specified information. As identified by the ECO,
    the content of the documents when viewed together did not demonstrate
    compliance with the mandatory requirements and the specified evidence
    required.

50. The appellant could not rely on Paragraph D as the ECO was not asked to
    consider any other documents over and above those provided with the
    application and the P60 for 2015 was not provided until the hearing
    before the First-tier Tribunal ( the P60 for 2014 was sent with the
    appeal documents ( see ECM review).  As the decision in Sultana and
    other (rules; waiver /further enquiry; discretion) [2104] UKUT
    00540(IAC) sets out at paragraph 20, the applicant's advisor must be
    alert to the totality of the applicable requirements enshrined in
    Appendix FM-SE and that if any of the discretionary powers conferred on
    the ECO by paragraph [D]should be exercised in their favour and should
    proactively make this case when submitting the application and to draw
    to the attention of the ECO the specific provisions of paragraph [D]
    invoked in support of the requirement to exercise discretion and to set
    out fully the grounds of that requirement. Whilst the grounds of appeal
    set out some of the matters subsequently relied upon by the applicant,
    as the ECM review set out, the explanation for lack of salary deposits
    into his bank account was not supported by any evidence.

51. The decision of the Upper Tribunal in Sultana ( as cited above) goes on
    to state: " If this sponsor genuinely cannot provide the necessary
    records concerning his decorating business, as it is a purely cash
    enterprise, he should, in any fresh application, specifically invoke
    paragraph [D](e) of the Appendix and make his case accordingly,
    advancing all relevant facts, justifications and explanations.  Issues
    of this kind belong firmly to the domain of the primary decision maker
    and should not be belatedly ventilated at the stage of either first
    instance or second instance appeal" at paragraph [20].

52. Therefore in summary, I consider that it was not open to the First-tier
    Tribunal judge to rely on the P60 when the bank statements and the
    payslips did not meet the requirements of the specified evidence set
    out in Appendix FM-SE for the reasons set out above. Even if I were
    wrong in my assessment of Paragraph 2A(i), the P60 would have to
    correspond to the relevant period and the P60 for April 2014  was for
    the sum of �18,281 and is therefore below the amount specified of
    �18,600.

53.  I have therefore reached the conclusion  that the First-tier Tribunal
    Judge could not have allowed the appeal under the Immigration Rules and
    I therefore set aside the decision and re-make it by dismissing the
    appeal under the Immigration Rules.

54. It seems to me that it would be open to the applicant in any fresh
    application to make specific submissions to invoke the provisions of
    [D] and by reliance on the evidence set out in the First-tier
    Tribunal's determination. In the alternative, as the guidance sets out,
    it would be open to the sponsor to take steps to pay the full net
    amount of his salary to the specified personal account for the
    requisite 6 months period to demonstrate that he can comply with the
    specified evidence required to show that he is able to maintain and
    support the applicant.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  on
a point of law and is set aside. The  appeal  is  re-made  as  follows:  the
Appellant's appeal under the Immigration Rules is dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.
