                            DECISION AND REASONS
Background


1. The Appellant is a national of Bangladesh who was  born  on  6  September
   1986. He entered the  United  Kingdom  on  27  October  2009  with  entry
   clearance as a student and was granted extensions of student leave  until
   27 June 2015.  On 22 December 2014 he made a human rights application for
   leave to remain in the United Kingdom on the basis of his marriage  to  a
   British Citizen. His  application  was  refused  by  the  Respondent  who
   concluded that he did not meet the requirements of the partner route. The
   Respondent  reached  this  conclusion  because  he  did  not   meet   the
   suitability requirements as his student leave had been curtailed so as to
   expire on 19 April 2014. Further, the Respondent was not  satisfied  that
   he met the income threshold of �18,600 and  concluded  that  the  English
   language test certificate did not meet the requirements  of  Appendix  O.
   The Respondent also  concluded  that  the  Appellant  did  not  meet  the
   requirements of paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules as he  did  not
   meet the length of residence requirements and  there  would  be  no  very
   significant obstacles to his integration into Bangladesh.


2. The Appellant appealed that decision to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  under
   section 82 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  (NIAA).
   His appeal was dismissed  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  O'Keefe  in  a
   decision promulgated on 6 September 2016. The Appellant sought permission
   to appeal against this decision and permission was granted by  First-tier
   Tribunal Judge Shimmin on 3 January 2017. In granting  permission,  Judge
   Shimmin found  that  it  was  arguable  that  the  Judge  had  found  the
   curtailment decision was served in circumstances short of the requirement
   of actual communication to the person concerned. He also  found  that  it
   was arguable that the Judge materially erred in the assessment of Article
   8. First-tier Judge Shimmin did not find it arguable that the  First-tier
   Tribunal misapplied the burden of proof in respect  of  the  decision  to
   curtail leave or that he erred in treating the factors taken into account
   under section 117B of the NIAA factors as neutral.


3. The grounds in respect of which permission to appeal was  granted  argued
   that the Judge accepted that the Respondent had not been  able  to  prove
   that the curtailment decision  was  communicated  to  the  Appellant  but
   nevertheless concluded that the Respondent had proved  effective  service
   of the decision because it was sent by recorded delivery post and  "there
   was no evidence before [the Judge] to show  that  the  recorded  delivery
   letter had been returned to the  Respondent".  It  was  argued  that  the
   approach was flawed because it was for the Respondent to prove  that  the
   decision was communicated in order  to  be  effective.   It  was  further
   argued that the Judge's findings on whether the Appellant had valid leave
   at the time of making the application  infected  the  assessment  of  the
   proportionality of removal. It was further contended that the  assessment
   was flawed as it was accepted  by  the  Respondent  that  that  sponsor's
   earnings met the income threshold requirement of �18,600 as at  the  date
   of the decision and it was accepted by the Judge that the  Appellant  met
   the English language requirements.


4. At a hearing on 14 February 2017 I found that there was a material  error
   of law in the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  the  following
   reasons which are recorded at paragraphs 12 and 13 of the decision:


   "There was no evidence before the First-tier  Tribunal  that  the  letter
   curtailing the Appellant's leave had been signed for and consequently the
   finding that the notice curtailing his leave  was  communicated  and  the
   Appellant was without leave when he made his application was an error  of
   law.


   The Respondent argues that this error was not material because it did not
   impact on the First-tier Tribunal's Article 8 assessment. The  First-tier
   Tribunal did take the  Appellant's  absence  of  leave  into  account  at
   paragraph 36 of the decision in the assessment under Part 5A of the  NIAA
   2002. Section 117 B of the NIAA 2002 provides that little  weight  should
   be given to a relationship with a qualifying partner that is  established
   at a time when the person  is  in  the  United  Kingdom  unlawfully.  The
   Appellant's partner as a British Citizen was a qualifying partner  and  I
   consider that the First-tier Tribunal having referred to the  absence  of
   leave in paragraph 36 had this in mind.   In the circumstances I conclude
   that the  error  was  material  as  it  is  also  clear  that  given  the
   Appellant's leave had not been curtailed that he also met the suitability
   findings of the Rules  and  on  the  Judge's  findings  met  the  English
   language requirement. On his case he also met the financial  requirements
   at the date  of  the  hearing.  I  therefore  find  that  the  Article  8
   assessment was  flawed  as  it  failed  to  take  into  account  relevant
   factors."


   5. I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and adjourned with
      directions for the remaking of the decision in the appeal.


 The Re-making of the decision in the appeal


 The Parties submissions


   6. Mr Singh accepted that it appeared from the Appellant's bundle that he
      met  the  financial  requirements  of  the  Rules.  However,  if   the
      documentation did not meet the  rules  there  were  no  insurmountable
      obstacles to return and nothing to suggest that there was  no  support
      from families in Bangladesh.

    7. Mr Khan said that it was accepted that the relationship was  genuine.
       The First-tier  Tribunal  had  accepted  that  the  English  language
       requirements were met and the financial requirements  were  now  met.
       The financial evidence covered the end of December 2016 to  May  2017
       and showed the Appellant's wife's gross income was just over �19,000.
       As of today's date the Appellant satisfied all of the requirements of
       the Rules. Mr Singh was not taking issue with that. Given that he met
       the requirements it could not be  proportionate  to  return  him.  He
       referred me to paragraph 51 of Agyarko and submitted that  there  was
       no public interest in his removal. The Appellant was  here  lawfully.
       His application would succeed if he  made  it  today.  There  was  no
       burden on public funds and with regard to the s117B considerations he
       had been here lawfully throughout.


 Discussion


    8. The Appellant claims that he now satisfies the  requirements  of  the
       Immigration Rules.  The Appellant's appeal is on human rights grounds
       only  against  the  refusal  of  a  human  rights  claim  under   the
       Immigration, Nationality and Asylum Act 2002 (section 82 and 84). The
       jurisdiction of the Tribunal in relation  to  appeals  on  Article  8
       grounds was considered in respect of visit visa cases and by  analogy
       the approach here should be the same. In Kaur (visit appeals; Article
       8) [2015] UKUT 00487 the Upper  Tribunal  held  that  the  Article  8
       decision on an appeal cannot be made in a vacuum.  Whilst judges only
       have jurisdiction to decide whether the decision  is  unlawful  under
       s.6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 the starting-point for deciding that
       must be the state of the evidence about the  appellant's  ability  to
       meet the requirements of the immigration rules.


    9. In addressing the questions in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27  I  accept  that
       the Appellant has a genuine and subsisting relationship with his wife
       which amounts to family life for  the  purposes  of  Article  8.  The
       Respondent  did  not  contend  in  the  RFRL  that  the  relationship
       requirements were not met. I accept that they married on  5  February
       2015 and have been living together since then. I also find  that  the
       proposed  interference  is  of  sufficient  gravity  to  engage   the
       operation of Article 8 and that the  interference  is  in  accordance
       with the law and necessary in a  democratic  society.  The  remaining
       question is therefore whether the interference  is  proportionate  to
       the legitimate public end sought to be achieved.


   10. My  starting  point  in  terms  of  proportionality  is  whether  the
       Appellant can satisfy the immigration  rules.  The  requirements  for
       limited leave to remain as a  partner  are  set  out  at  R-LTRP  and
       require the satisfaction of  the  suitability  requirements  and  the
       eligibility requirements  which  include  relationship  requirements;
       immigration status requirements; financial requirements  and  English
       language  requirements.  It  is  not  in  issue  that  the  Appellant
       satisfies the relationship requirements. The Respondent also accepted
       that he met the suitability requirements. His application was refused
       by the Respondent because the Respondent concluded that his leave was
       curtailed so as to expire on 19 April 2014. I  have  found  that  his
       leave was not curtailed for the  reasons  given  in  my  decision  in
       relation to the error of law. On my findings therefore the  Appellant
       was not in the UK in breach of immigration laws when he  applied  for
       leave to remain on the basis of marriage.  The  Respondent  concluded
       in the RFRL that he was unable to meet the financial requirements  of
       the Rules because although he had provided some evidence of an income
       of �19,800 at the date  of  the  application,  at  the  time  of  the
       application his spouse had been in employment for a  period  of  five
       months. It was accepted that she  had  worked  for  longer  than  six
       months at the date of the refusal, however,  only  evidence  provided
       with the application could be accepted  for  consideration.  Further,
       the bank statements submitted by the Appellant did not  show  all  of
       the funds being  paid  in.  At  the  hearing  before  the  First-tier
       Tribunal it was accepted by the Appellant's representative  that  the
       Appellant did not meet the financial requirements of the  immigration
       rules as the Appellant's wife had not been employed in both her  jobs
       for more than 6 months at the date of the application.


   11. The First-tier Tribunal found that the Appellant met the requirements
       of Appendix O in relation to the English Language requirement of  the
       Rules (E-LTRP.4.1) and that finding stands.


   12. The immigration rules  in  relation  to  specified  evidence  are  at
       Appendix FM-SE and require, in the case of salaried employment,  that
       an applicant must produce payslips for a period of 6 months prior  to
       the date of the application; a letter from the  employer  who  issued
       the payslips confirming the salary; the length of the employment; the
       period they were paid; the level of salary relied on and the type  of
       employment. Additionally personal bank  statements  corresponding  to
       the same period must be provided. The evidence must be submitted with
       the application  and  dated  no  earlier  than  28  days  before  the
       application.


   13.  The formal requirements of Appendix FM-SE could not be  met  at  the
       date of the application as the Appellant's wife was unable to provide
       the specified evidence of her employment. The  Appellant's  wife  has
       two sources of income, namely from Lion  Heating  Ltd  and  Poundland
       Ltd. Her P60s for the tax year to April 2017 show that  she  received
       �12,822.20 from Poundland Ltd and �7332.57 from Lion Heating Ltd.  He
       has produced payslips from Lion Heating for the period December  2016
       to May 2016 showing net payments of �533.27 which are also  reflected
       in her bank statements for the same  period.  He  has  also  produced
       payslips for Poundland for the same period showing  net  payments  of
       between �798.26 and �949.04 also showing in her bank  statements  for
       the same period.


   14. The Appellant also  produced  a  letter  from  Lion  Heating  and  an
       employment contract with Poundland neither of which complies with the
       specified evidence requirements for the  employer's  letter  set  out
       above.   Although  the  Appellant  has  failed  to  produce   letters
       complying with the exact requirements of Appendix FM-SE there can, in
       my judgement, be no doubt that the Appellant's wife earns  in  excess
       of the income requirement of �18,600 set by  the  Immigration  Rules.
       Her P60s  taken  together  with  six  months  of  payslips  and  bank
       statements are sufficient evidence of this. In R (on the  application
       of MM (Lebanon)) (Appellant)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
       Department [2017] UKSC  10  the  Supreme  Court  made  the  following
       comments at paragraphs 76 and 77 in relation  to  the  weight  to  be
       accorded to the  Secretary  of  State's  policies  and  expertise  as
       expressed in the Rules:


"75. As Lord Reed has shown (Hesham Ali, paras 46f), although  the  tribunal
    must make its own judgment, it  should  attach  considerable  weight  to
    judgments made by  the  Secretary  of  State  in  the  exercise  of  her
    constitutional responsibility for  immigration  policy.  He  cites  Lord
    Bingham's reference in Huang to the need to accord appropriate weight to
    the judgment of a person "with responsibility for a given subject matter
    and access to special sources of knowledge and advice". As that  passage
    indicates,  there  are  two  aspects,  logically  distinct:  first,  the
    constitutional responsibility of the  Secretary  of  State  for  setting
    national policy in this area; and secondly the  expertise  available  to
    her and her department in setting and implementing that policy. Both are
    relevant in the present case, but the degree of respect which should  be
    accorded to them may be different. The weight to be given to  the  rules
    or Departmental guidance will depend on the extent to which  matters  of
    policy or implementation have been informed  by  the  special  expertise
    available to the Department. A good illustration in a different  factual
    context is to be found in the Denbigh High School case, above, on  which
    Lord  Wilson  in  Quila  (para  46ff)  placed  particular  reliance   as
    explaining "the nature of the court's inquiry" under the "fair  balance"
    part of the four-stage test. Lord Bingham  (para  30)  referred  to  the
    "value judgment" required, in which proportionality  was  to  be  judged
    "objectively,  by  the  court  ..."  It  is  notable  however  that  the
    "objective" inquiry actually undertaken by Lord  Bingham  in  that  case
    (concerning school uniform policy as applied to Muslim  girls)  involved
    giving substantial weight to the judgment of the school:


  "It would in my  opinion  be  irresponsible  of  any  court,  lacking  the
       experience, background and detailed knowledge of the  head  teacher,
       staff and governors, to overrule  their  judgment  on  a  matter  as
       sensitive as this. The power of decision has been given to them  for
       the compelling reason that they are best placed to exercise it,  and
       I see no reason to disturb their decision."


By contrast in Quila itself, as Lord Wilson held (para  58),  the  Secretary
    of State had failed to show any adequate  evidentiary  support  for  the
    policy choices reflected in the rules under challenge.


76. As Lord Reed explains (Agyarko, para 47), this  approach  is  consistent
    with the margin of appreciation permitted by the Strasbourg court on  an
    "intensely political" issue, such as immigration control. However,  this
    important principle should not be taken too far. Not everything  in  the
    rules need be treated as high policy or peculiarly within  the  province
    of the Secretary of State, nor  as  necessarily  entitled  to  the  same
    weight. The tribunal is  entitled  to  see  a  difference  in  principle
    between the underlying public interest considerations,  as  set  by  the
    Secretary of State with the approval of Parliament, and the working  out
    of that policy through the detailed  machinery  of  the  rules  and  its
    application to individual cases. The  former  naturally  include  issues
    such as the seriousness of levels of  offending  sufficient  to  require
    deportation in the  public  interest  (Hesham  Ali,  para  46).  Similar
    considerations would apply to rules reflecting the Secretary of  State's
    assessment of levels of income required to  avoid  a  burden  on  public
    resources, informed  as  it  is  by  the  specialist  expertise  of  the
    Migration Advisory Committee. By contrast rules as  to  the  quality  of
    evidence necessary to satisfy that test in a particular case are, as the
    committee acknowledged, matters of practicality rather  than  principle;
    and as such matters on which the tribunal may more readily draw  on  its
    own experience and expertise."


   15. I  accept,  having  considered  the  evidence  before  me,  that  the
       Appellant meets the substantive financial requirements of  the  Rules
       and has demonstrated that his wife's income exceeds �18,600. This has
       a significant impact on the weight to  the  accorded  to  the  public
       interest in immigration control. However, section 117 B of  the  2002
       Act must also be considered. Sections 117A and 117B are found in part
       5A of the 2002 Act and apply in all cases where a court  or  tribunal
       is  required  to  determine  whether  a  decision  made   under   the
       Immigration Acts breaches a person's rights under Article 8.


Section 117A is as follows:

           (1) This Part applies where a court or tribunal is  required  to
           determine whether a decision made under the Immigration Acts-

             (a) breaches a person's  right  to  respect  for  private  and
             family life under Article 8, and

             (b) as a result would be unlawful under section 6 of the Human
             Rights Act 1998.

           (2) In considering the public interest question,  the  court  or
           tribunal must (in particular) have regard-

             (a) in all cases, to  the  considerations  listed  in  section
             117B, and

             (b) in cases concerning the deportation of foreign  criminals,
             to the considerations listed in section 117C.

           (3) In subsection (2), "the public interest question" means  the
           question of whether an interference with  a  person's  right  to
           respect for private and family life is justified  under  Article
           8(2).


   16. The considerations referred to in section 117A(2)(a), which are  said
       by that provision to be applicable in  all  cases  where  the  public
       interest question is under consideration, are as follows:

            (1) The maintenance of effective immigration controls is in the
           public interest.

           (2) It is in the public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
           interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that
           persons who seek to enter or remain in the  United  Kingdom  are
           able to speak English, because persons who can speak English-

             (a) are less of a burden on taxpayers, and

             (b) are better able to integrate into society.

           (3) It is in the public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
           interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that
           persons who seek to enter or remain in the  United  Kingdom  are
           financially independent, because such persons-

             (a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and

             (b) are better able to integrate into society.

           (4) Little weight should be given to-

             (a) a private life, or

             (b) a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,

             that is established by a person at a time when the  person  is
             in the United Kingdom unlawfully.

           (5) Little weight should be given to a private life  established
           by a person at a time when the person's  immigration  status  is
           precarious.


 17.  The Appellant speaks English having  satisfied  the  requirements  of
       Appendix O. He can obtain no positive right to a grant  of  leave  to
       remain from either s117B (2) or (3), whatever the degree  of  fluency
       in English, or the strength of their financial resources as these are
       neutral factors (Rhuppiah [2016] EWCA Civ 803). In Rhuppiah the Court
       of Appeal held at  paragraph  63  that  the  expression  'financially
       independent' should be given its natural  meaning  of  as  indicating
       someone who is financially independent of others.  The  Appellant  is
       dependent  on  his  wife  and  for  the  purposes  of  s117B  is  not
       financially independent although it cannot be said that he will be  a
       burden on the state as he meets the  financial  requirements  of  the
       immigration rules. He  formed  his  relationship  with  a  qualifying
       partner when he was here lawfully as, on my findings, he has remained
       in the UK lawfully since October 2009.  As concluded by Lord Reed  in
       Hesham Ali v Secretary of State [2016] UKSC 60, para 42,  and  R  (on
       the application of Agyarko) v SSHD  [2017]  UKSC  11,  para  42,  the
       ultimate issue is whether a fair  balance  has  been  struck  between
       individual and public interests, taking account the  various  factors
       identified. In the circumstances of this case,  where  the  Appellant
       meets the requirements of the Rules and there are no public  interest
       considerations that weigh against him in the  balancing  exercise,  I
       find that his removal would be disproportionate.
