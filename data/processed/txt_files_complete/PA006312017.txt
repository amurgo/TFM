For the Appellant:     Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mrs F Farrell, of P G Farrell, Solicitors

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The parties are as described above,  but  the  rest  of  this  decision
    refers to them as they were in the FtT.

 2. By a decision dated 5 January 2017 the  SSHD  refused  the  appellant's
    claims on all available grounds.

 3. By a decision promulgated on 12 May 2017 First-tier Tribunal Judge P  A
    Grant-Hutchison allowed the appellant's appeal "on human rights grounds
    under article 8 only".

 4. The SSHD's grounds of appeal to the UT, in summary, are as follows:

      At �19 and 22, unclear against what  threshold  the  judge  considered
      proportionality.

      At �24, implied test of reasonableness of  being  expected  to  return
      applied to the core issue of the medical condition of the oldest child
      of the appellant's partner  (Benny)  but  neither  he  nor  the  other
      children living with the  appellant  were  qualifying  children  under
      s.117B(6) of the 2002 Act, so that was not the test.

      The test outside the rules was compelling  circumstances,  which  must
      amount to more than "mere hardship, mere hurdles,  mere  upheaval  and
      mere inconvenience, even where  multiplied":  Treebhawon  [2017]  UKUT
      00013.

      The countervailing public interest in removal  outweighs  consequences
      for the health of an appellant because of a disparity of  health  care
      facilities "in all but a very few rare cases"; "when  weighed  against
      the public interest in ensuring that  the  limited  resources  of  the
      country's health services are used to the best effect for the  benefit
      of those for whom they are intended, those consequences do  not  weigh
      heavily in [an appellant's] favour but speak cogently  in  support  of
      the public interest in removal": Akhalu (health claim: ECHR article 8)
      [2013] UKUT 400.

      The judge refers at �24 to a  letter  from  Dr  O'Regan,  but  not  to
      submissions for the SSHD that there was no  basis  for  the  statement
      that treatment would not be available in the DRC.

      The judge noted that the appellant's partner and children could return
      with him to their country of nationality, so it was not  apparent  why
      this would be one of the "very rare cases" envisaged  above,  or  that
      receipt of DLA benefit would be sufficient to  justify  the  decision.
      The proportionality reasoning was inadequate.

      The judge's consideration of the appellant's relationship  with  a  UK
      citizen child whom he  had  rarely  seen  was  inadequate,  given  the
      challenges made by the SSHD to the genuineness  of  the  relationship,
      and absence of a statement from the child's mother about contact.   No
      reason was given for saying that communication would be  exceptionally
      difficult,  or  why  modern  communications  would  be  an  inadequate
      substitute for infrequent contact.

 5. The appellant filed a response, dated 6 July 2017,  to  the  notice  of
    appeal, which in summary is on these lines:

      The judge correctly applied the Razgar test.

      (The eldest child arrived in the UK not in January 2011 but in January
      2012.)  The judge did not apply a wrong test  of  reasonableness.   He
      made it clear at �19 that he was to consider whether the circumstances
      were "relevant, weighty and not fully provided for within  the  rules.
      In practice, they are likely to be both  compelling  and  exceptional,
      but this is not a legal requirement."

      The  appellant's  partner  and  her  three  children  [after   various
      procedure] were all given discretionary leave.  The SSHD had therefore
      accepted that the eldest child could not be  successfully  treated  in
      the DRC.  This submission was unchallenged by the presenting officer.

      The judge was referring to the comments  by  the  doctor  rather  than
      making a specific finding about treatment in the DRC.

      The article 8 findings are sound and in accordance with the law.

      Contact from overseas by  modern  communications  is  not  a  relevant
      consideration: Hussini [2017] CSOH 80.

      Since the hearing the appellant's partner and children have had  their
      [discretionary] leave extended until 13 December 2019.  Permission  is
      sought to admit evidence thereof.

 6. Mrs Farrell indicated that the further evidence was  tendered  only  if
    error of law was found and the decision  required  to  be  remade.   Mr
    Matthews said that there would be no objection to  its  admission,  and
    confirmed that the respondent had granted further leave.

 7. The family situation is not entirely clear from the  decisions  of  the
    respondent and the FtT.  Mrs Farrell said that the appellant lives with
    his partner  and  three  children.   The  oldest,  Benny,  is  not  his
    biological child.  The  two  younger  ones  are  the  children  of  the
    appellant and his partner.  The appellant, his partner and those  three
    children are all citizens of the DRC, and of  no  other  country.   The
    appellant has another child, residing in England, who is a UK  citizen.
    Mr Matthews  did  not  dissent  from  that  summary  of  the  essential
    background facts.

 8. Mr  Matthews  submitted  thus.   The  case  should  have  been  decided
    according to principles well established for cases where family life is
    carried on by persons with only precarious  status,  now  confirmed  by
    Agyarko.  Even at �19 the judge did not state the law quite  correctly.
    More importantly, at  �24  he  effectively  decided  the  case  by  the
    question whether it was reasonable to expect the appellant's partner to
    leave,  by  reference  to  the  health  of  her  child.  That   was   a
    significantly lower standard than the correct one.  It would be bizarre
    if the case could succeed outside the  rules  by  criteria  lower  than
    those which would apply if the case came within the rules (that is,  by
    reasonableness rather than insurmountable  obstacles).   This  was  not
    just poorly chosen or loose language,  but  failure  to  recognise  the
    correct legal parameters.  The high point of the appellant's  case  was
    Benny's heath condition.  That  was  a  "very  difficult  epilepsy"  as
    disclosed by the report of the consultant neurologist, Dr O'Regan,  but
    it fell short of the standard for a case  to  succeed  only  on  health
    grounds.  It was accepted that health care might not  be  available  to
    the child in DRC to UK standards, but the SSHD had cited evidence  that
    treatment for epilepsy was available at  �107  -  121  of  the  refusal
    decision, to which the judge did not  refer.   The  judge  appeared  to
    adopt uncritically Dr O'Regan's assertion that treatment  was  unlikely
    in the DRC, but  she  was  an  expert  in  neurology,  not  on  medical
    standards in the DRC.  She had no more standing in  that  respect  than
    any other witness.  The Judge took the  receipt  of  Disability  Living
    Allowance as an indication of the seriousness of the  condition,  which
    was an unjustified inference.  Recipients of DLA even  at  its  highest
    rates may carry on normal working lives.  The child was not born in the
    UK but came here after his mother did, when aged 6.  Her  evidence  was
    silent as to how his condition had been treated while he lived in  DRC.
    The judge was not referred to Akhalu, but that was a statement of well-
    established law which he was bound to apply.  This  was  a  case  where
    none of the family members living with  the  appellant  had  more  than
    precarious status.   The judge had taken the  appellant's  relationship
    with his UK citizen child as a factor, when there was  no  evidence  of
    meaningful contact.  The case was capable of decision either  way,  but
    the present decision could not survive  excision  of  its  errors.   It
    should be remade, based on all the evidence and  submissions,  applying
    the considerations under art 5A of the 2002 Act, and the principles  of
    precarious  cases.   The  appellant  made   no   claim   to   financial
    independence.  He had given evidence through an interpreter, so ability
    to speak English was not in his favour either.  The outcome  should  be
    reversed.

 9. Mrs Farrell relied upon the  reply  above,  and  submitted  further  as
    follows.  The judge at �19 articulated the correct test, which could be
    confirmed by reference for example to Lama [2017] UKUT 00016 at �29,  a
    decision of the President: the test is "compelling circumstances".   It
    was undisputed  that  family  life  existed  for  article  8  purposes.
    Although on very different facts, the legal exercise carried out by the
    FtT was along the lines exemplified by Lama.  It was  disingenuous  for
    the SSHD to argue that Benny should reasonably leave the UK,  when  the
    SSHD had conceded and paid expenses of a judicial review brought on the
    basis of his condition, and had then granted leave to the other  family
    members.

10. Mr Matthews said in reply that the reasons for conceding  the  judicial
    review and the grants of leave had not been before the FtT, would  have
    turned on different considerations to the present case, and were not to
    be taken to  show  that  the  SSHD  was  disingenuous.   The  grant  of
    discretionary leave to remain could not be assumed to depend solely  on
    the child's condition.  There were complex policies on  enforcement  of
    removal.   The  removal  of  the  appellant  would   be   proportionate
    notwithstanding the leave granted to  family  members,  whose  position
    could not be equated to UK citizens,  none  of  whom  were  "qualifying
    children", and who might reasonably be expected to leave.

11. I reserved my decision.

12. Neither party referred directly to Agyarko  [2017]  UKSC  11.   Perhaps
    most pertinent is �57:

      That approach  is  also  appropriate  when  a  court  or  tribunal  is
      considering whether a refusal of leave to remain  is  compatible  with
      article 8 in the context of precarious family life. Ultimately, it has
      to decide whether the refusal is proportionate in the particular  case
      before it, balancing the  strength  of  the  public  interest  in  the
      removal of the person in question against the impact  on  private  and
      family life. In doing so, it should give  appropriate  weight  to  the
      Secretary  of  State's  policy,  expressed  in  the  Rules   and   the
      Instructions, that the public interest in immigration control  can  be
      outweighed, when  considering  an  application  for  leave  to  remain
      brought by a person in the UK in  breach  of  immigration  laws,  only
      where   there   are   "insurmountable   obstacles"   or   "exceptional
      circumstances" as defined. It must also consider all factors  relevant
      to the specific case  in  question,  including,  where  relevant,  the
      matters discussed in  paras  51-52  above.  The  critical  issue  will
      generally be whether, giving due weight to the strength of the  public
      interest in the removal of the person  in  the  case  before  it,  the
      article 8 claim is sufficiently strong to outweigh it. In general,  in
      cases  concerned  with  precarious  family  life,  a  very  strong  or
      compelling claim is  required  to  outweigh  the  public  interest  in
      immigration control.

13. Although the Judge was said to have not got the law  "quite  right"  at
    �19, I see no meaningful distinction between his self-direction and the
    case law, now including Agyarko.

14. I also note Muhammad Arslan Khan [2016] CSIH 13 per the Lord  President
    at �13:

      It  is  important  not  to  over-complicate  the  exercise  which  the
      immigration tribunals require to carry out ... Elaborate re-statements
      of multi-facetted tests are seldom necessary at first instance level.

15. Point by point, the SSHD made criticisms of some force, but in the end,
    that was only reargument of one side of the case.  The  decision  might
    have benefited from individual analysis of  the  factors  specified  in
    part 5A of the 2002 Act, rather than by brief reference at the  end  of
    �25 (cf. Lama).  However, I prefer the overall reading advanced by  Mrs
    Farrell.  The judge's  comments  at  �24  are  along  the  way  to  his
    decision, which is eventually reached by an overall  assessment.   That
    does not turn essentially on the medical treatment available to  Benny,
    but above all on the fact that  other  family  members  have  leave  to
    remain.  Although the SSHD argued that was  irrelevant,  and  submitted
    that the outcome made more of  their  status  than  the  appellant  was
    entitled to expect, there is obvious tension between granting leave  to
    the mother and children and not to the father of the family.

16. The relationship with a UK citizen child  was  not  supported  by  much
    evidence, but that  was  an  additional  element,  and  the  judge  was
    justified in  saying  that  further  contact  would  be  "exceptionally
    difficult", if the appellant  was  living  in  DRC  and  the  child  in
    England.  The child is young.  Visits by the appellant to the UK  after
    removal seem unlikely.  There was nothing to suggest  the  child  might
    visit the DRC.  It is not shown that the Judge made any  more  of  this
    than he should have.

17. The test as formulated by the Judge at �19 is no less than required  by
    the case law, including Agyarko.  He found "a  highly  unusual  set  of
    circumstances" at �25.  He continued by saying that "it cannot be  said
    that it is proportionate for the appellant to  return",  which  may  go
    rather far in suggesting there could be only one rational outcome;  but
    the judgement that the public interest should yield was  open  to  him.
    As in Lamas (�47) the judgement may have been "never clear cut and  ...
    positioned in close proximity to the notional borderline",  but  it  is
    not one which discloses error of law, such as  to  justify  setting  it
    aside.

18. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

19. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
