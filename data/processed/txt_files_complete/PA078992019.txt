For the Appellant:     Mr Fazli, Counsel instructed by Sohaib Fatimi
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Afghanistan born in 1998.    He  appeals
    with permission against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  (Judge
    Buckwell) to dismiss his appeal on protection and human rights grounds.

 2. The Appellant arrived in the United Kingdom and claimed asylum in 2014.
     There were two planks to his claim as advanced before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal. The first was that as a young man of fighting age  he  had  a
    well-founded fear of persecution by the Taliban in  his  home  area  of
    Baghlan, who had tried to recruit him. He did not want to  be  a  Talib
    and was afraid that they would persecute him as a result of his refusal
    to join the group.  The second issue concerned the Appellant's fear  of
    persecution at the hands of the Afghan authorities, who  perceived  him
    to be a member of the Taliban and therefore wished to arrest him.

 3. In respect of the first plank the First-tier Tribunal found there to be
    material discrepancy between the Appellant's description of his  forced
    recruitment  by  the  Taliban  and  the  objective  country  background
    material before the First-tier Tribunal. In  particular  his  claim  to
    have been taken on four occasions in two  years  for  a  few  hours  of
    training at a time was not consonant with the general practice  of  the
    Taliban in recruiting children from the ranks of Madrassa pupils. Those
    boys are taken directly into full time training. The 'taster  sessions'
    described by the Appellant were not consistent with this  evidence  and
    did not "ring true".  Having made that finding the Tribunal said this:

         "103.    On the basis of my view of the main thrust of the  account
         by the Appellant I do not find otherwise that my concerns  in  that
         respect  are  altered  by  the  purported  documentation  provided.
         Original documents  were  not  provided...the  documents  were  not
         independently verified by  any  expert  and  I  must  consider  the
         veracity of such documents in the round. In doing so  of  course  I
         take into account the views I have expressed as to the  recruitment
         account put forward by the Appellant. On that basis I do  not  give
         weight to the documents which the Appellant has  produced  in  copy
         form".

 4. As to the second plank, no findings are made.

 5. The grounds of appeal are:

          i) That a material unfairness has arisen from a mistake of  fact.
             The originals of the documents mentioned by  the  Tribunal  at
             its ï¿½103 were in fact available for inspection at the hearing.
             The Appellant had them with him and had the Tribunal wanted to
             see them it could have  done  so.   A  witness  statement  and
             certified copies of the documents were provided in support  of
             the grounds.

         ii) The approach taken by the Judge to those documents did not  in
             any event accord with the Tanveer  Ahmed[1]  requirement  that
             the evidence all be considered 'in the round'.

        iii) That the omission to make findings on the risk from the Afghan
             authorities was a material error.

    Error of Law: Discussion and Findings

 6. I am satisfied that grounds (i) and (ii) are made  out.  Whilst  it  is
    true that the Tribunal had  other  concerns  about  the  documentation,
    specifically the lack of expert verification,  the  documents  produced
    were a central element of the Appellant's case and as such should  have
    been considered in the round. The documents being before  the  Tribunal
    in copy form one wonders why the no-one thought to bring to the Judge's
    attention that the originals were present in court,  but  that  is  not
    important now. What matters is that the Judge, in his concern over  the
    lack of originals, was labouring under a misapprehension. As  such  the
    failing was not necessarily his, but it is  an  unfairness  capable  of
    justifying interference with his decision. It is an error of  the  same
    species discussed in MM (unfairness; E & R)  Sudan  [2014]  UKUT  00105
    (IAC):

         "(2) A successful appeal is not dependent on the  demonstration  of
         some failing on the part of the FtT. Thus an error of  law  may  be
         found  to  have  occurred  in  circumstances  where  some  material
         evidence, through no fault of the FtT,  was  not  considered,  with
         resulting unfairness (E & R v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
         Department [2004] EWCA Civ 49)."

 7. As for the second limb of the Appellant's case, the claimed fear of the
    Afghan authorities, this was a factual  issue  that  required  discrete
    findings. The Appellant had produced evidence - in oral and documentary
    form - that he is wanted by the Afghan authorities who suspect  him  of
    membership of the Taliban. That could be true regardless of whether the
    Appellant was ever given taster sessions by  the  Taliban  in  Baghlan.
    The failure to make those findings was a further material error.

 8. In the circumstances the parties agreed that the most appropriate forum
    for the remaking of this decision  would  be  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    where an 'in person' hearing can take place with  an  interpreter,  and
    the original documents produced.

    Anonymity Order

 9. This appeal concerns a claim for protection.  Having had regard to Rule
    14 of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  and  the
    Presidential Guidance Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity Orders  I  therefore
    consider it appropriate to make an order in the following terms:

         "Unless and until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
         Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
         shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his
         family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
         Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
         direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"




    Decision and Directions

10. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is flawed for material error of
    law and it is set aside.

11. The decision in the appeal is to be remade in the  First-tier  Tribunal
    following a fresh hearing before a Judge other than Judge Buckwell.

12. There is an order for anonymity.
