Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr Z Hussain, Legal Representative
For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. In a decision promulgated on 20 February 2019 I set aside the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal  and  directed  that  the  appeal  would  be
    reheard in the Upper Tribunal by me. A copy of my decision on error  of
    law is attached as an appendix to this decision.

   2. I was not asked and saw no reason to make an anonymity direction.  The
      general rule  is  that  hearings  are  held  in  public  and  judicial
      decisions are published (A v BBC [2014] UKSC 25) and I saw  no  reason
      to depart from the general rule in this case.

 3. The appellants in this appeal are a mother and son. They entered the UK
    together  as  visitors  on  23  September  2003  and   overstayed.   An
    application for leave outside the rules was made in September 2012  and
    refused without a right of appeal in November 2013.  On 9 December 2016
    a human rights application was made on the basis  of  the  interference
    with family life which would be occasioned by removing the  appellants.
    The second appellant was a minor and had lived in the UK for more  than
    seven years.

 4. The respondent refused the application on 25 October  2017.  The  first
    appellant could not meet  the  requirements  of  paragraph  EX.1(a)  of
    Appendix FM of the Immigration  Rules  because  it  was  reasonable  to
    expect the second appellant to leave the UK and return to Bangladesh to
    live there with the first appellant. There  were  no  very  significant
    obstacles to the first appellant's  reintegration  in  Bangladesh.  The
    second appellant could not meet  the  requirements  of  the  rules  for
    minors and there were no exceptional circumstances to justify  a  grant
    of leave outside the rules.

 5. Having heard oral evidence from the appellants and received  a  written
    statement from the first appellant's  brother,  Mr  Miah,  I  make  the
    following findings of fact to the balance of probabilities.

 6. The chronology set out in paragraph 2 above is agreed.  The  appellants
    only held leave to enter the UK for a brief  period  of  a  few  months
    before they overstayed. They have had no leave since 29 February  2004.
    They have now resided in the UK continuously for 15� years. The  second
    appellant was 3� when he arrived in the UK and he is now 19.

 7. The circumstances explaining how it  came  about  that  the  appellants
    overstayed their visit visas are  set  out  in  the  first  appellant's
    witness statement. She says they were abandoned at her  mother's  house
    by her husband.  He and his family members were threatening and  warned
    her against contacting him.  He  has  not  been  in  contact  with  the
    appellants since then. If they had returned to  Bangladesh  they  would
    have had nowhere to go and the  first  appellant  felt  afraid  of  her
    husband and in-laws. In short, she had never intended to remain in  the
    UK but felt she had no other option. She was encouraged by  her  family
    in the UK to remain.

 8. Ms Everett did not challenge this evidence. Her  cross-examination  was
    limited to asking whether the appellants were in contact with anyone in
    Bangladesh, which they both denied. There was a degree of  evasiveness,
    particularly with regard to  the  second  appellant's  evidence.  Asked
    whether his mother  was  in  contact  with  anyone  in  Bangladesh,  he
    answered cautiously, "not as far as  I  know".  Having  denied  knowing
    anyone in Bangladesh, it emerged that his uncle, Mr Miah's, wife is  in
    Bangladesh. However, this is not enough, in my judgment, to lead to  an
    adverse inference being drawn about the core  of  the  claim  that  the
    appellants were effectively forced to remain in the UK by  the  actions
    of the first appellant's husband in abandoning them here. I accept that
    most of the close family which the appellants have are in  the  UK  and
    that Mr Miah, who is a British citizen, is planning to bring  his  wife
    to the UK.

 9. I accept the appellants have settled into life in the  UK,  where  they
    have been supported by Mr Miah, with whom they  reside.  I  accept  the
    first appellant has, over time, lost her ties with Bangladesh. I accept
    the second appellant has no real ties with the country of his birth. He
    does not remember it. Whilst he lives in a  Bangladeshi  household,  he
    says he cannot read of write Bengali. He is certainly integrated in the
    UK, having had his entire education here. He plans to go to  university
    as soon as he can resolve his immigration status.

10. The first appellant is 56 years of age.  In the last few weeks she  has
    received a diagnosis of follicular lymphoma  and  is  awaiting  further
    investigation. She has an appointment at  the  haematological  oncology
    department at Bart's hospital in  June.  According  to  the  background
    evidence supplied by Mr Hussain, follicular lymphoma cannot  be  cured.
    However, it grows slowly and patients may not need treatment  for  many
    years. If treatment is needed, it usually works well. Patients are kept
    under surveillance so  that  treatment  can  start  when  they  develop
    symptoms or the disease begins to change. I accept that receiving  such
    a diagnosis will have been very frightening for  the  first  appellant.
    Given it is too soon to know how her disease will develop, I proceed on
    the basis she will require monitoring for the foreseeable future.

11. Mr Hussain also provided a  recent  news  article  from  a  Bangladeshi
    newspaper which describes a grim situation for cancer  sufferers  there
    due to "overwhelming treatment costs, wrong diagnosis, faulty treatment
    plans and shortage of trained  doctors  and  treatment  facilities".  I
    accept that obtaining the assistance  she  needs  in  Bangladesh  would
    prove very problematic for the first appellant.

12. It is clear I can only allow the appeals if  the  decision  is  not  in
    accordance with section 6 of the Human Rights Act, which in  this  case
    means the decision under appeal amounts to a disproportionate  lack  of
    respect for the enjoyment of family or private life. In all  cases  the
    ultimate question is whether there is interference with  the  enjoyment
    of article 8 rights which is disproportionate. The Secretary  of  State
    has set out his position as  to  where  the  public  interest  lies  by
    publishing Immigration Rules and in most cases the ability to show that
    the rules are met  would  provide  an  answer  to  the  proportionality
    question. The fact the rules are not met  must  be  given  considerable
    weight (Hesham Ali v SSHD [2016] UKSC 60).

13. Paragraph 276ADE(1) of the Immigration Rules, HC395, reads as follows:

         "276ADE (1). The requirements to be met by an applicant  for  leave
         to remain on the grounds of private life in the UK are that at  the
         date of application, the applicant:

             (i) does not fall for refusal under  any  of  the  grounds  in
             Section S-LTR 1.2 to S-LTR 2.3. and S-LTR.3.1.  to  S-LTR.4.5.
             in Appendix FM; and

             (ii)      has made a valid application for leave to remain  on
             the grounds of private life in the UK; and

             (iii)     has lived continuously in the UK  for  at  least  20
             years (discounting any period of imprisonment); or

             (iv)       is  under  the  age  of  18  years  and  has  lived
             continuously in the UK for at least 7 years  (discounting  any
             period of imprisonment) and it  would  not  be  reasonable  to
             expect the applicant to leave the UK; or

             (v) is aged 18 years or above and under 25 years and has spent
             at least half of  his  life  living  continuously  in  the  UK
             (discounting any period of imprisonment); or

             (vi)      subject to sub-paragraph (2), is aged  18  years  or
             above, has lived continuously in the UK for less than 20 years
             (discounting any period of imprisonment) but  there  would  be
             very significant obstacles to the applicant's integration into
             the country to which he would have to go if required to  leave
             the UK."

14. When assessing the public interest, I am required  to  have  regard  to
    section 117B of the 2002 Act reads as follows:

         "(1)     The maintenance of effective immigration  controls  is  in
         the public interest.

         (2)      It is in the public interest, and  in  particular  in  the
         interests of the economic well-being of the  United  Kingdom,  that
         persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are  able
         to speak English, because persons who can speak English-

             (a) are less of a burden on taxpayers, and

             (b) are better able to integrate into society.

         (3)      It is in the public interest, and  in  particular  in  the
         interests of the economic well-being of the  United  Kingdom,  that
         persons who seek to enter or  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  are
         financially independent, because such persons-

             (a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and

             (b) are better able to integrate into society.

         (4)      Little weight should be given to-

             (a) a private life, or

             (b) a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,

         that is established by a person at a time when the person is in the
         United Kingdom unlawfully.

         (5)       Little  weight  should  be  given  to  a   private   life
         established by a person at a time  when  the  person's  immigration
         status is precarious.

         ..."

15. I accept  there  is  family  life  as  between  the  first  and  second
    appellants. There is no bright line when a child  reaches  majority  at
    which point family life ends. It  depends  on  the  facts.  The  second
    appellant remains living at home  with  his  mother  and  her  extended
    family. He is an only-child and he has had no contact at all  with  his
    father for many years. The bond between mother and son  would  be  very
    strong under such circumstances.

16.  I  bear  in  mind  the  case  of  AA  v  United  Kingdom  (Application
    No.8000/08), a decision of the European Court of Human Rights, where it
    was said at paragraph 49 that:

         "An examination of the court's case law would tend to suggest  that
         the applicant, a young adult of 24 years old, who resides with  his
         mother and has not yet founded a family of his own, can be regarded
         as having 'family life'."

17. There would no  be  no  real  interference  with  family  life  if  the
    appellants were to be removed together. However, I  accept  the  second
    appellant's evidence that he would not leave the UK.  Moreover,  he  is
    very unlikely to be required to leave given he could  no,  on  a  fresh
    application,  show  that  he  meets  the  requirements   of   paragraph
    276ADE(1)(v) of the rules. Suitability has not been put in issue by the
    respondent and there is no reason to suggest it would be.

18. I must consider each appellant individually but also bear in mind  they
    form a family unit. It is helpful in this case to start by  considering
    the second appellant. I have explained in my decision on error  of  law
    that he cannot meet the rules for the purposes of this  appeal  because
    of the requirement in paragraph  276ADE(1)  to  fulfil  the  conditions
    described at the date of application. At the date  of  application  the
    second appellant was not yet 18.

19. It has been clear since the Supreme Court decision in Patel and  others
    v  SSHD  [2013]  UKSC  72  that  there  is  no  formalised  'near-miss'
    principle, although all the facts have to be  taken  onto  account  and
    considered in context. I have focused on the  position  of  the  second
    appellant outside the rules. Removing him would certainly  represent  a
    significant interference with his enjoyment of the private life he will
    have established in the UK over the years. The decisive  issue  is  the
    proportionality of removal. In R (on the application of Agyarko) v SSHD
    [2017] UKSC 11, the Supreme Court explained that the ultimate  question
    in article 8 cases is whether a fair balance has  been  struck  between
    the competing public and  individual  interests  involved,  applying  a
    proportionality test.

20. As said, in assessing the public interest, I am bound to have regard to
    the factors listed in  section  117B.  Looking  at  the  factors  in  a
    structured way, I note the following. There is, in general terms, great
    public interest in ensuring  immigration  controls  are  maintained  by
    removing overstayers. The appellant speaks English but that is  only  a
    neutral factor. He is financially  independent  (see  Rhuppiah  v  SSHD
    [2018] UKSC 58) but this is also only  a  neutral  factor.  Whilst  the
    decision to overstay was made by his mother, little weight can be given
    to his private life, according to the statute, because nearly  all  his
    time in the UK has been unlawful.

21. The conundrum  posed  by  this  case  is  therefore  to  determine  the
    proportionality of the  decision,  which  would  entail  uprooting  the
    appellant after so many years, balancing the "little weight" which  can
    be given to his private life with the fact the respondent's own  policy
    would  be  to  grant  leave  to  the  appellant  if  he  made  a  fresh
    application. Mr Hussain's submission was that the  public  interest  in
    removing the appellant is reduced to zero in  these  circumstances.  On
    the other hand,  the  interests  of  immigration  control  demand  that
    applicants  go  through  the  correct  procedure  of  making   a   paid
    application. It has long been recognised that article 8 should  not  be
    used simply to circumvent inconvenient requirements of the rules.

22. There may be a loose analogy to be  drawn  with  the  circumstances  in
    which it is argued a partner, who cannot show the rules have been  met,
    should apply for entry clearance once in a position to do so.  However,
    there must be a "sensible reason" to expect them to do so, which  there
    may not be if it is clear the rules will be met. I ask  myself  whether
    there is a sensible reason to expect the appellant to  make  a  further
    application now that he can show that he meets the requirements of  the
    rules.

23. On the respondent's side, it may  be  argued  there  is  always  strong
    public  interest  in  correct  applications  being   made,   with   the
    appropriate fee being paid, so that applicants  are  not  permitted  to
    "short-cut" the process. I give those matters considerable weight.

24. However, in my judgment,  this  is  one  of  the  few  cases  in  which
    sufficiently compelling reasons have been shown to  justify  a  finding
    that the decision is disproportionate. That is because the private life
    which the appellant has been permitted to establish in the UK, spanning
    most of his life, is of a particularly valuable kind. The appellant has
    spent all his formative years here and has completed all his  education
    here. He has lost all of his ties with Bangladesh  and  he  has  become
    entirely integrated in the UK. This state of affairs is  recognised  as
    outweighing the public interest by paragraph 276ADE(1)(v) of the rules.
    Notwithstanding the requirement to apply section 117B(iv), I find  that
    these matters render the decision disproportionate.

25. The second appellant's appeal is allowed on human rights grounds.

26. I now return to consider the position of the  first  appellant.  Unlike
    Judge Jones, I do so on the basis that the second appellant  would  not
    accompany her and she would be returning alone. To do so would rupture,
    not only the private life she has established in the UK, but  also  her
    family life with the second appellant. Given the  background  of  their
    being abandoned in the UK and her having brought him  up  as  a  single
    parent, this family life is of a particularly valuable kind.

  27.  Starting  with  the  rules  and   the   requirements   of   paragraph
      276ADE(1)(vi), I remind myself that the meaning of similar  provisions
      in relation to deportation appeals found in  section  117C(4)  of  the
      2002 Act and paragraph 339A of the rules was considered in SSHD  v  AK
      (Sierra Leone) [2016] EWCA Civ 813. Sales LJ said at paragraph  14  as
      follows:

         "In my view, the concept of a foreign criminal's "integration" into
         the country to which it is proposed that he be deported, as set out
         in section 117C(4)(c) and paragraph 399A, is a broad one. It is not
         confined to the mere ability to find a job or to sustain life while
         living in the other country. It is not  appropriate  to  treat  the
         statutory language as subject to some gloss and it will usually  be
         sufficient for a court or tribunal simply to direct itself  in  the
         terms that Parliament has chosen to use. The idea of  "integration"
         calls for a broad evaluative judgment to be made as to whether  the
         individual will be enough of an insider in terms  of  understanding
         how life in the society in that other country is carried on  and  a
         capacity  to  participate  in  it,  so  as  to  have  a  reasonable
         opportunity to be accepted there, to be able to operate on a day-to-
         day basis in that society and to build up within a reasonable  time
         a  variety  of  human  relationships  to  give  substance  to   the
         individual's private or family life."

    In Treebhawon and Others (NIAA 2002 Part 5A - compelling  circumstances
    test) [2017] UKUT 00013 (IAC), McCloskey J, in re-making the  decision,
    said the "very significant obstacles"  test  was  clearly  an  elevated
    threshold.

  28. I note the appellant was 41 when she entered the  UK  so  she  clearly
      spent the majority of her  life  in  Bangladesh.  She  speaks  Bengali
      (Sylheti). She is Muslim. She cannot seriously contend that she  would
      not be able to reintegrate in the sense of understanding how  life  in
      Bangladesh works. Her experience of 41 years living  in  that  country
      would mean she could quickly assimilate and become an  insider  again,
      despite her lengthy absence. I do not see any reason why  the  support
      she receives financially in the UK could  not  continue  if  she  went
      back, although she claims  that  to  pay  for  her  upkeep,  including
      accommodation and medical expenses, would be too much for Mr Miah, who
      currently lets her stay in his house. The rule is not met.

  29. However, I do nevertheless consider that removing her would amount  to
      a disproportionate breach of  family  and  private  life  outside  the
      rules. My reasons are as follows.

  30. I start by noting that the first appellant is financially  independent
      but it must be weighed against her that she does  not  speak  English.
      Her private life has been established through overstaying and,  whilst
      I accept the circumstances  which  brought  this  about  were  matters
      largely beyond her control, she bears  more  responsibility  for  this
      than the second appellant.  There is considerable public  interest  in
      removing overstayers to give members of the public confidence that the
      law is properly applied. Significant weight must  be  given  to  these
      matters.

  31. However, as mentioned, I consider that separating mother and son would
      amount to a rupture of valuable  family  life  ties  which  occasional
      visits and telephone  or  skype  contact  would  not  be  an  adequate
      substitute for. There  is  an  unusual  degree  of  mutual  dependence
      between the appellants because of their history.

  32. I accept the first appellant has no home to return  to  in  Bangladesh
      and no family members she could turn to for accommodation.  She  would
      be forced to find her  own  accommodation.  Mr  Hussain  submitted  an
      article  from  another  Bangladeshi  news  platform   describing   the
      difficulties faced by unmarried  females  in  securing  accommodation.
      Parts of the article are obscured but I accept the  thrust  of  it  is
      that women are defined by  their  marital  status  in  Bangladesh  and
      prevailing attitudes are suspicious towards women who choose  to  live
      independently.

  33. Mr Hussain also provided me with  a  copy  of  the  respondent's  CPIN
      Bangladesh: Women fearing gender based violence, version 2.0,  January
      2018, which also reports on the restrictions on the  participation  of
      women in the workplace and social stigma against single women.  Living
      without male support is "almost impossible". Realistically, the  first
      appellant would face almost insuperable difficulties in trying to live
      independently as a lone female. She might conceivably  find  extremely
      low -paid employment in the garment industry but her age  and  marital
      status would place huge obstacles in her path. Her  outlook  would  be
      very bleak indeed.

  34. There is also the matter of her diagnosis. This is not a  health  case
      in the sense that it is argued that  removing  her  would  lead  to  a
      deterioration in her health so as to breach her human rights. However,
      it is a significant factor in the proportionality balancing  exercise.
      She is more likely than not  going  to  require  medical  intervention
      beyond simple monitoring in the foreseeable future. As seen, this will
      be very difficult to access.  Even  the  monitoring  she  requires  is
      likely to be difficult and extremely costly to obtain. It would  be  a
      further obstacle in her path in terms of living independently.

  35. The compassionate circumstances in  this  case  mount  up.  The  first
      appellant is not a young woman, she was abandoned by her husband,  she
      would be separated from her only child, she would not have the support
      of close family members in Bangladesh  and  would  have  to  fend  for
      herself with whatever support Mr Miah  can  provide,  she  would  face
      stigma and discrimination as a single woman without male support, and,
      she has been diagnosed with cancer, albeit this does not appear to  be
      life-threatening at present, for which she would  struggle  to  obtain
      treatment when the time comes.

  36. For all these reasons, I regard  the  decision  to  remove  the  first
      appellant alone to amount to a disproportionate breach of  article  8.
      The public interest in  removal  is  outweighed  by  the  matters  put
      forward on behalf of the first appellant notwithstanding her inability
      to show she meets the requirements of the rules.

Notice of Decision

The decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  is  set  aside.  The  following
decision is substituted:

      The appeals are allowed on human rights grounds (article 8).

Fee Award   Note: this is not part of the decision.

In the light of my decision  to  re-make  the  decision  in  the  appeal  by
allowing it, I have considered whether to make a fee award. However, I  have
decided not to make any fee award in view  of  the  fact  the  appeals  were
allowed largely because of a change of  circumstances  since  the  decision,
namely the length of the second appellant's residence.

I make no fee award.

APPENDIX: DECISION ON ERROR OF LAW



                    DECISION AND REASONS ON ERROR OF LAW

 1. The appellants in this appeal are a mother and son. They entered the UK
    together  as  visitors  on  23  September  2003  and   overstayed.   An
    application for leave outside the rules was made in September 2012  and
    refused without a right of appeal in November 2013.  On 9 December 2016
    a human rights application was made on the basis  of  the  interference
    with family life which would be occasioned by removing the  appellants.
    The second appellant was a minor and had lived in the UK for more  than
    seven years.

 2. The respondent refused the application on 25 October  2017.  The  first
    appellant could not meet  the  requirements  of  paragraph  EX.1(a)  of
    Appendix FM of the Immigration  Rules  because  it  was  reasonable  to
    expect the second appellant to leave the UK and return to Bangladesh to
    live there with the first appellant. There  were  no  very  significant
    obstacles to the first appellant's  reintegration  in  Bangladesh.  The
    second appellant could not meet the requirements of the rules and there
    were no exceptional circumstances to justify a grant of  leave  outside
    the rules.

 3. The appeal was heard on 4 June 2018 at Hatton Cross  by  Judge  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Geraint Jones QC. The first appellant  argued  that
    her  appeal  should  be  allowed  under  paragraph  276ADE(1)  of   the
    Immigration Rules. The judge accepted she  may  find  some  significant
    obstacles to reintegration in Bangladesh but not of such severity  that
    they could probably be characterised as very significant obstacles.  He
    found that the reality of the appeals  was  that  the  first  appellant
    simply wished to continue residing in  the  UK  because  she  has  many
    family members here but the rule does not  provide  applicants  with  a
    choice of country of residence and it is not there to reward those  who
    have flouted the law. The judge went on to  find  that  there  were  no
    exceptional or compelling circumstances to warrant allowing the  appeal
    on article 8 grounds outside the rules.

 4. It was pointed out to the judge at the hearing that, since the date  of
    decision, the second appellant  could  now  meet  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 276ADE(1)(v),  having  passed  his  eighteenth  birthday  and
    having spent more than half his life in  the  UK.  However,  the  judge
    declined to take this into account, reasoning  that  his  consideration
    was whether the appeal fell to be allowed against  the  decision  which
    rested on paragraph 276ADE(1)(iv). With respect to that rule, he  found
    it was not unreasonable to expect him to leave the UK.

 5. The grounds submitted to the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  permission  to
    appeal were considered by the  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    consist largely of an attempt  to  reargue  the  appeal.  However,  the
    renewed grounds to the Upper Tribunal found  favour.  It  was  arguable
    that Judge Jones failed to give  consideration  to  the  weight  to  be
    attached, in  assessing  the  proportionality  of  removing  the  first
    appellant,  to  the  ability  of  the  second  appellant  to  meet  the
    requirements of paragraph 276ADE(1)(v) by  the  time  of  the  hearing.
    Arguably therefore the judge had failed to have regard to all  relevant
    matters.

 6. The respondent has not filed a rule 24 response.

 7. Mr Hussein, who represented the appellant before Judge  Jones,  and  Mr
    Kotas explained that they had had some discussions about the  case.  Mr
    Kotas considered he was in difficulties because it  appeared  that  the
    presenting officer  at  Hatton  Cross  had  conceded  that  the  second
    appellant would now meet the requirements of paragraph 276ADE(1)(v) and
    therefore the judge should have taken this into account when making his
    proportionality assessment. On that basis, the appeal  was  allowed  by
    consent and the decision of Judge Jones set aside. I would add only the
    following.

 8. The judge was plainly right that the second appellant did not meet  the
    requirements of paragraph 276ADE(1)(v) such that his  appeal  could  be
    allowed on the basis that the rules were met, albeit  on  human  rights
    grounds. As he pointed out in his decision, the provisions of the  rule
    must be shown to be met as at the date of application and at that  time
    the second appellant was only 16.

 9. However, that was not  the  end  of  the  matter.  When  assessing  the
    proportionality of the decision outside the rules, it was incumbent  on
    the judge to take into account when weighing  the  public  interest  in
    removal the fact that  the  second  appellant  could  now  satisfy  the
    substance of the rule. It was an error therefore to proceed to consider
    the impact on the first appellant of removal on the assumption that the
    second appellant would accompany her to Bangladesh.

10. The decision shall be re-made by the Upper Tribunal. It is reserved  to
    me. The parties may file up to date evidence.

Notice of Decision

The appeal is allowed. The decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  contains  a
material error of law and is set aside. The appeal will be  re-made  in  the
Upper Tribunal.
