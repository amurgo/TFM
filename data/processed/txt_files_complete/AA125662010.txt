Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Ibrar Hussain, with Lei Dat & Baig, solicitors
For the Respondent:    No appearance or representation


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. The appellant is a citizen of the People's Republic of China, from  Hubei
   province, who has two daughters, living with their grandparents in China,
   and a son, born in the United Kingdom in 2008. Her husband  has  been  in
   the United Kingdom since April 2006, and the appellant joined him here in
   May 2007, after a  five  month  journey  from  China.   This  appeal  was
   identified as one in which the outcome was likely to  be  determined,  or
   substantially affected, by the Upper Tribunal's decision in  relation  to
   the risk on return to China arising out of the  Chinese  family  planning
   policy.   That determination has  now  been  promulgated  as  AX  (family
   planning scheme) China CG [2012] UKUT 97 (IAC).

2.  The  appellant  was  one  of  those  affected  by  the  failure  of  the
   Immigration Advisory Service, which went into  administration  in  August
   2012.  Since then she has been  represented  by  a  firm  of  experienced
   immigration solicitors, Lei Dat & Baig.

The First-tier Tribunal determination

3. In a determination made on 12 October  2010,  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
   Sykes set out the appellant's account.  She was 29  years  old  when  she
   came to the United Kingdom and is now 35 years old.    Before  coming  to
   the United Kingdom, she lived with her parents-in-law in Yi Chang city in
   Hubei province.  Her husband worked away from home, returning  from  time
   to time.  Her first daughter was born in 2000, when the appellant was  22
   years old.  She did not have an IUD fitted, as expected; she 'kept out of
   the way' because her husband and parents-in-law wanted  a  second  child.
   They were hoping for a son.

4. In September 2004, she was pregnant again.  She had  not  applied  for  a
   birth permit and the child, a daughter, was born at home.  Her mother  in
   law wanted the appellant to give the child to her own  childless  sister;
   the appellant refused.  The second daughter was not  registered  and  was
   kept out of sight.  The appellant still did not have an  IUD  fitted  and
   neither she nor her husband was sterilised.

5. In August  2005,  just  three  months  after  the  birth  of  her  second
   daughter, the appellant's father  paid  for  her  to  leave  China.   She
   travelled to France, where she was detained.  She suffered a  miscarriage
   in detention and was very ill.  Two months later,  her  father  paid  RMB
   50,000 to bring her back to China.   Once home, the appellant kept out of
   the way of officials.

6. Her husband left China for the  United  Kingdom  in  2006.   Without  his
   support in China, things were difficult  for  the  appellant,  especially
   with her mother in law, who still wanted a grandson.  Her second daughter
   was not living at her parents-in-law' home and the appellant was  allowed
   to see her only occasionally,  which  distressed  her,  but  without  the
   correct paperwork, she could not keep her daughter.

7. The appellant left  China  again  in  January  2007,  travelling  through
   various countries, arriving in May  2007  in  the  United  Kingdom.   Her
   husband  had  formed  another  relationship  but  they  resumed   marital
   relations and she became pregnant by him almost immediately:  she  had  a
   son in March 2008.   The relationship  failed  and  he  returned  to  his
   girlfriend.  The appellant claimed asylum in November 2007, when she  was
   about five or six months pregnant.

8. The appellant's claimed husband, Feng Lin, was a Chinese citizen born  in
   1975.  He is therefore about two years older than the appellant.  He  was
   in the United Kingdom unlawfully and without status, and was not  treated
   as a dependant in these proceedings.

9. The appellant did not know  where  he  was  living  and  had  no  way  of
   contacting him, though occasionally he contacted  her  and  came  to  her
   home.  He sometimes stayed at a friend's  house  but  she  did  not  know
   where.  He had made no effort to support her  application  or  provide  a
   witness statement and no evidence of the marriage  was  available.    The
   First-tier Tribunal Judge found that there  was  no  extant  family  life
   between the couple, though, if the child born in the United  Kingdom  was
   his son, family life of course existed between father  and  son,  however
   sparse their contact.  That  family  life  could  be  maintained  if  the
   appellant's husband returned to China with his wife and family.

10. On the question of the  credibility  of  the  appellant's  account,  the
   First-tier Tribunal Judge said this:

    "25.   I do  have  some  reservations  about  the  credibility  of  her
    account.  This because although she says she is now reconciled with her
    husband who apparently attended the appeal hearing  in  order  to  look
    after the child, there is no statement from him and  he  did  not  give
    evidence at the hearing.  Mr Reyaz [for the appellant]  confirmed  that
    it was her husband who was in the courtroom and I  asked  him  on  more
    than one occasion to confirm that it was not the intention to call  him
    to give evidence; if he had been called, it would have been appropriate
    to ask him to leave the  courtroom  during  the  appellant's  own  oral
    evidence.

       26. Mr Reyaz confirmed that that was the case  and  reasserted  that
           decision  when  the  appellant  was  being  pressed  in   cross-
           examination to explain why her husband was not being called; she
           was ready to have him give evidence.  This seems to me to  be  a
           serious gap in the evidence from which I would  be  entitled  to
           draw the conclusion that it undermined the  credibility  of  the
           appellant's account.  Mr  Jones  in  his  submissions  [for  the
           respondent] asked me to do so.

       27. I have now however determined the asylum appeal on  that  basis.
           This is partly because the refusal letter itself does  not  take
           any serious issue with a factual basis of the claim, and  partly
           because at the CMR the respondent's rep confirmed that the facts
           were largely not in dispute and that it was the operation of the
           one child policy that was the issue.  I have therefore  confined
           my determination of the appeal to that policy. "

11. The appeal was dismissed on asylum, humanitarian  protection  and  human
   rights grounds.  The appellant appealed.

Permission to appeal

12. The First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  had  set  out  very  full  reasons  and
   argument on the family planning policy in China.  In granting  permission
   to appeal, Upper Tribunal Judge Allen indicated  that  he  considered  it
   arguable that the First-tier Tribunal Judge had made a perverse  decision
   as to the risk of forced sterilisation for this appellant if she were  to
   be returned to China.

Error of law

13. In finding that there was indeed an error of law, and setting aside  the
   determination for remaking, First-tier Tribunal Judge  Lever  on  19  May
   2011 noted that there was no country guidance on the point and  that  the
   decisions of  senior  courts  interest  he  United  Kingdom,  Canada  and
   Australia were divergent.  He found that it had been an error of law  for
   the First-tier Tribunal Judge to  have  derived  evidence  from  his  own
   research conducted after the hearing, and to  base  conclusions  on  that
   research, without giving the parties an opportunity to comment on it.

The Upper Tribunal proceedings

14. The case was identified as one of a number which might be  suitable  for
   country guidance on the Chinese family planning policy.   In  the  event,
   another appeal formed the basis of the country guidance given in  AX  and
   the Upper Tribunal must now  apply  that  decision  to  this  appellant's
   circumstances.   On 19 September 2012, I directed the parties  to  assist
   the Tribunal further, in the light of that decision, as follows:

           "Directions


           1. The appellant shall state, not later than 28 September 2012:

              (a)      Whether she has been granted any type  of  leave  to
              remain, and if so, what leave was granted; and

              (b)      Whether she wishes to pursue  her  case  before  the
              Upper Tribunal in this appeal.


           2. If the appeal is pursued:


              (a)      the appellant shall, not later than 5 October  2012,
              file and serve written submissions setting  out  clearly  her
              case in relation to the AX guidance;

              (b)      the  respondent  shall  state,  not  later  than  19
              October 2012, whether she maintains  her  opposition  to  the
              grant  of  international   protection   under   the   Refugee
              Convention,  humanitarian  protection,  or  on  human  rights
              grounds, and if so, on what basis.


           3. The parties are on notice that:


              (a)  the Upper Tribunal will consider everything received  by
              it in response to these  directions,  before  deciding  under
              rule 34 whether it is necessary to have an  oral  hearing  of
              any aspect of the appeal; and


              (b)  a failure by  a  party  to  comply  with  any  of  these
              directions may lead the Upper  Tribunal  to  proceed  on  the
              basis that nothing (or nothing further)  is  to  be  said  or
              advanced in support of that party's  case  before  the  Upper
              Tribunal."


15.  The  appellant's   representatives   complied   and   filed   a   small
   supplementary bundle, including written submissions on AX, the UKBA  form
   IS.96 (a document granting temporary admission  but  indicating  that  he
   remains liable to detention) issued  to  the  appellant's  partner  on  7
   December 2012, evidence relating to the appellant's  son's  schooling  in
   the United Kingdom, and various materials relating  to  circumstances  in
   China, in particular the 'one child policy', abortion,  family  planning,
   and the enforcement of sterilisation in Guangdong and  Fujian.    I  will
   return to those materials when considering my  decision.   There  was  an
   updated statement from the appellant, but there is still no evidence from
   her claimed husband.

   May 2013 witness statement

16. The appellant's updated witness statement stated  that  she  was  living
   with her husband, Feng Lin, and their son, at an  address  in  Liverpool.
   She had waited over two years for her appeal to be re-heard.  She and her
   husband had reunited and recommenced living together after the  birth  of
   their son in March 2008 and were very happy together.

17. Their son was now over five years old.  He was attending  Lister  Infant
   School.  He loved his school, had made many friends, and had  taken  part
   in school events, such as the Olympics, and the Christmas Nativity  play.
   He spoke more English than Chinese; when she spoke to him in  Chinese  he
   would ask 'what does that mean?'.  He was very British  in  his  culture.
   Early problems with his hearing  had  been  resolved  after  he  attended
   hospital for them.

18. The appellant was studying ESOL Basic English at  Stonycroft  Children's
   Centre, since after six years in the United  Kingdom,  she  felt  it  was
   important to integrate fully into British life.  The three of them had  a
   close and loving family life together in the United Kingdom.

19. The appellant's understanding was that she would be unable  to  register
   her son in China; she already had  an  unregistered  daughter,  whom  she
   could never see, and the authorities would force  her  to  be  sterilised
   since it was not permitted to have three children in her home area.   She
   had left China illegally and would be unable to afford the fines for  her
   third unregistered child.   Having  to  hide  her  daughter  had  been  a
   heartbreaking situation and she would not wish to have  to  do  the  same
   with her son.







   Upper Tribunal hearing

20. The appeal came before  me  as  an  oral  hearing  on  17  May  2013  at
   Manchester   Hearing   Centre.    The   respondent   did   not    arrange
   representation.   The appellant gave oral evidence, it having  been  over
   two years since the last factual assessment of her situation.

   Appellant's evidence

21. The appellant confirmed  her  name  and  address  and  adopted  her  new
   witness statement.  It had been translated to her and she had checked it.
    It contained the evidence she wished to give to the Tribunal.   She gave
   further evidence, answering questions from her representative and from me
   to clarify her history.

22. The appellant clarified that her daughters were living with  her  mother
   in law in China.  She seldom spoke to her mother  in  law;  her  children
   seemed very distant on the infrequent occasions when the appellant called
   there; they had been apart for a long time.  The elder girl was 13  years
   now and had lived without her mother since she was seven; the younger was
   eight and had never really lived with her mother at all.  She had  spoken
   to them last about a month before the hearing (so in April 2013)  but  it
   was clear that the girls did not really like their mother any more.   Her
   husband had a better relationship with his mother; he spoke  to  her  and
   received news of the girls, but they seldom wanted to talk to  either  of
   their parents.

23. The elder girl was registered and attended school,  including  fee  paid
   'cram' school, in which she got additional learning in the 6th  grade  to
   help her with national examinations taken at 11 or 12  years  old.    She
   passed on her learning to the younger one, who was unregistered  and  not
   attending school.   The younger one could not really go out; if  she  was
   ill and needed a doctor, she used her elder sister's  name.   Fortunately
   she had only had a few minor illnesses such as colds and rarely needed to
   see a doctor.

24. The family in China were always afraid that the authorities  would  take
   the younger girl away.  She could not be registered because of the  'one-
   child' policy, and she needed to be registered in order to attend school.
     Parents had to  register  children  personally,  but  both  the  girls'
   parents had been in the United Kingdom for many years now.

25. The appellant's Chinese identity card had expired  while  she  had  been
   away and if she returned she would have to go and renew  it.   How  could
   she do that, when she was in breach by having three  children?   Internal
   relocation was not an option; that would require  government  sponsorship
   and in seeking that, the appellant would risk arrest.

26. Her son had been at primary school in the United Kingdom for almost  two
   full years (it was two years in July 2013).  He was integrated,  refusing
   to speak Chinese and speaking to her in English.  He was in  good  health
   and happy in his schooling.  He liked dancing  and  Christmas  parties  a
   lot, and had friends in his school.

27. Neither the appellant nor her husband had worked in  the  six  or  seven
   years they had spent in the United Kingdom.  They  were  living  on  NASS
   benefits, receiving �96.90 weekly.   She had managed to save about  �200-
   300 in her Lloyds TSB account.  They had no cash savings other than  that
   and had been unable to  send  any  money  back  to  China  to  repay  the
   snakehead fees her father had incurred for her  abortive  departure  from
   China in 2005, her return, and her second departure in 2007.

28. The appellant's younger brother and her parents  were  still  in  China.
   She was estranged from them all.

29. Her departures from and return to China had put her  father  in  a  very
   difficult financial position.  Her father had borrowed a lot of money for
   her travel.  Her father had telephoned the appellant in 2012 to ask  when
   she would send back the money she  owed  him;  the  appellant  could  not
   remember which month that had been, but it was around  the  time  of  the
   Chinese New Year, when every Chinese person goes back home  to  celebrate
   with their families, but the appellant had  no  money  so  she  had  been
   unable to go home. It was hard for her to reach him now, because  he  was
   on the run from the people from whom he had borrowed the money.  She  did
   not know where he had gone.

30. Her younger brother blamed the appellant for what had  happened  to  the
   family and was no longer speaking to her.  He was an  interior  designer,
   with a wife and child of his own, and worked in other provinces.

31. The appellant explained her marital difficulties.  After  the  birth  of
   their second daughter, she and her husband had been  quarrelling  because
   they had no son.  The appellant was not living at home with her  parents-
   in-law; they had been living with friends and hiding, since the birth  of
   the first child in 2000,  because  she  did  not  wish  to  have  an  IUD
   inserted.

32. She  had  not  resumed  menstruating  after  the  birth  of  her  second
   daughter, and people told  her  that  she  was  pregnant  again,  so  the
   appellant had travelled to Europe in 2005, hoping to get to Ireland.  She
   was detained in France, where she lost the baby,  and  became  very  ill.
   She went home.  Her husband left her and went to the United  Kingdom  the
   following year.  The appellant followed him in 2007,  travelling  without
   her  daughters  because  the  route  was  illegal,   involving   climbing
   mountains, and quite unsuitable for children.  She left  the  girls  with
   her mother in law, and sometimes they  lived  at  their  paternal  aunt's
   house.  Her mother in law also feared arrest, so the children  could  not
   live in her parents-in-law' house.

33. When the appellant reached  the  United  Kingdom,  she  found  that  her
   husband had a girlfriend and it had taken some  time  for  things  to  go
   right between them.  They were all living together now, and  things  were
   fine again.  He had not given evidence on their solicitors'  advice.   He
   was not at court for the Upper Tribunal hearing because the child was  at
   school.  She could not explain why there was no  witness  statement  from
   her husband.  He had claimed asylum in his own right in 2010; until then,
   he had been working as a chef.  His application had been refused and  she
   did not know what was happening about it now because the solicitors  firm
   had closed down.

34. There were no criminal charges against either of them.   They  both  had
   rural hukous in China.  If the appellant  were  returned  to  China,  she
   would wish to live with all three of her children but she feared that all
   of the family would be arrested because of  her  illegal  departure  from
   China.  Her unregistered children would be sent to an orphanage.

35. The appellant had not worked in China either.   Her  literacy  was  low,
   since she had only completed primary school in China, so  she  could  not
   find employment.  Her husband had worked on building  sites,  because  he
   also was uneducated.  In their day, secondary education was not available
   to all as it was now; it was necessary to achieve a good grade in primary
   school in order to progress to secondary education, whereas now, children
   all received nine years' education.

36. The appellant and her brother were both  registered  without  difficulty
   since the one child policy had only started in 2008; he had done  better,
   completing two years of high school  as  well  as  primary  school.   Her
   mother in law had a younger sister, who was registered  and  was  in  her
   fifties.

   Submissions

37. The  appellant's  solicitors,  Lei  Dat  &  Baig,  provided  an  undated
   skeleton argument.  In that document they argued that  the delay from May
   2011, when an error of law was found in this appeal, to  the  hearing  in
   May 2013, entitled the appellant to leave to remain on the principles set
   out in Hb (Ethiopia) and ors v SSHD [2006] EWCA CV 1713.

38. Regarding the Tribunal's country guidance decision in AX,  the  skeleton
   argument noted that this decision had not been in existence at  the  date
   of hearing. The appellant relied particularly on paragraphs 81-82 of  AX,
   paragraph 87, paragraphs 92-95, paragraphs 102-107,  paragraph  124,  and
   the independent country evidence produced by the appellant, all of which,
   except one document from LifeNews.com, predates the  evidence  considered
   in AX.

39. In relation to Article 8 ECHR, the  skeleton  argument  notes  that  the
   third child is foreign-born.  Relying on paragraphs 148, 172 and  187  of
   AX, the appellant contends that registration is complex and there  is  no
   guarantee that the appellant's third child will be registered. They  rely
   on  a report, 'Birth Registration in  China:    Practices,  Problems  and
   Policies' compiled by the  Institute  for  Population  and  Developmental
   Studies, Xian Jiaotong University, Xian Shaanxi Province 710049.

40. In applying Razgar, R (on the Application of) v. Secretary of State  for
   the Home Department [2004] UKHL 27, the appellant argues  that  there  is
   private and family life between the appellant, her son and her husband in
   the United Kingdom.  In relation to  the  best  interests  of  the  child
   pursuant to s.55 Borders,  Citizenship  and  Immigration  Act  2009,  she
   relies on   E-A (Article 8 - best interests of child) Nigeria [2011] UKUT
   315 (IAC),  MK (best interests of child) India [2011]  UKUT  00475  (IAC)
   and  LD (Article 8 best interests of  child)  Zimbabwe  [2010]  UKUT  278
   (IAC) but does not say what in particular she draws from those decisions.
    Similarly, she relies on the Enforcement Guidance  and  Instructions  on
   the former paragraph 395C of the  Rules  as  to  cases  which  should  be
   sympathetically considered, where  the  delay  has  been  caused  by  the
   respondent.

41. Finally, she relies on EB (Kosovo) v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
   Department [2008] UKHL 41 which deals principally with spouses who  enter
   into their relationship while one of them is awaiting a decision.

42. In addition, Mr Hussain made the following submissions at  the  hearing.
   The appellant and her husband were not a double-single couple  since  she
   had a sibling; they were from the majority Han ethnic group  and  from  a
   strict province, Hubei.  Their fear of repercussions and in particular of
   forced sterilisation was a genuine fear.  In the post-2010 structure,  he
   argued that there remained  a  risk  of  forced  sterilisation  in  Hubei
   because it was a strict province.  The second daughter had been  born  in
   breach of the Hubei family planning  Regulations,  although  he  accepted
   that the third child, the couple's son, who had been born in  the  United
   Kingdom, would not be treated as born in breach of the policy.

43. He argued that there had been insufficient  real  change  in  China  and
   that  paragraph  339K  of  the  Immigration  Rules   applied.    Internal
   relocation would be unduly harsh for these parties, especially with three
   children of whom the middle child was not registered and had been born in
   breach of the family planning policy.  In  order  to  renew  her  Chinese
   identity card, the appellant would have to contact  her  hukou  area  and
   there was a reasonable likelihood that she  would  come  to  the  adverse
   attention  of  the  authorities  and  face  a   real   risk   of   forced
   sterilisation.

44. He asked me to allow the appeal.

45. I reserved my decision.

   Findings of fact and credibility

46. I remind myself that the standard of proof  of  the  facts  and  matters
   relied upon by the appellant is  the  lower  standard  of  real  risk  or
   reasonable  degree  of  likelihood,  appropriate  to  the   international
   protection conventions, but that to that lower standard,  the  burden  of
   proof is upon her.

47. There is no doubt that the appellant has been unlawfully in  the  United
   Kingdom for six years and has a  male  child  aged  5  born  here.    Her
   relationship with her claimed husband concerns me, as it  did  the  first
   judge in 2010.   There continues to be a puzzling  lack  of  support  for
   this application by him.  The application was made in November 2007,  and
   the determination in 2010 made it clear that there  were  concerns  about
   the husband's lack of support and the lack of evidence from him,  but  at
   the latest hearing he was not present and no witness statement  appeared.
   His temporary admission document is dated 2012, not 2010;  that  suggests
   that he may have left the United Kingdom and returned.

48. There is very little evidence about the girl children in China.   Taking
   the appellant's evidence  at  its  highest,  it  appears  that  they  are
   estranged from her and that they may be living with their paternal  aunt,
   at least some of the time.

49. The evidence is that the appellant and  her  husband  are  not  educated
   people; neither of them qualified for secondary education at a time  when
   it was not freely available to children in China.  Before 2010, there was
   no legislation and the situation in China was  much  more  unpredictable.
   Nevertheless the appellant's father is said to have borrowed and tried to
   pay huge sums on three occasions,  to  enable  her  to  leave  China  for
   Ireland in 2005 while pregnant; to repatriate her when she lost the baby;
   and to enable her to leave China for the United  Kingdom  in  2007.   The
   amounts borrowed would have been more than sufficient to  pay  any  fines
   which were due in China for the unlawful birth.  By concealing the  birth
   of the second daughter, the family has been able to  continue  to  access
   free schooling and healthcare for the older daughter.

50. For the purposes of this decision, having regard to the  lower  standard
   of proof, I accept that the appellant has the three children  she  claims
   to have and that their legal status is as  claimed,  in  that  the  elder
   daughter is registered, the second daughter is not,  and  their  son  was
   born in the United Kingdom and has a United Kingdom birth certificate but
   is a Chinese national.

51.  Photographs  of  the  appellant's  child  at  his  school,  and  school
   documents, confirm that he is enjoying  school,  but  he  is  still  very
   young.  There is no indication of any  particular  friendships  or  links
   outside the home.   His hearing difficulties have resolved:  I note  that
   Alder Hey Children's Hospital saw the child 'with his mum' and  there  is
   no mention of any other parent.

52. I do not accept that the appellant has  family  life  with  her  claimed
   husband Feng Lin.  Her account in 2010 was that he turned up occasionally
   at her home but that she was unable to contact him.  Her account in  2013
   is that they were fully reunited and  have  been  living  together  since
   2008.  I do not believe that, to any standard.  There is a curious letter
   at p116 of the bundle before me from a Fang Lin, who says  he  has  known
   the appellant's son since he was born as a 'long family friend' and  that
   the child is a 'bright happy little boy who enjoys going to school and to
   learn new things'.  I am unable to tell whether that is the  same  person
   as the Feng Lin whom the appellant claims is the child's father.




   The AX (China) guidance

53. The Upper Tribunal gave guidance on the Chinese family  planning  policy
   in April 2012 in AX (family planning scheme)  China  CG  [2012]  UKUT  97
   (IAC).  The judicial head note summarises our findings as follows:

      Chinese family planning scheme:

      (1) In China, all state obligations and benefits depend  on  the  area
      where a person holds their 'hukou', the  name  given  to  the  Chinese
      household registration system.  There  are  different  provisions  for
      those holding an 'urban hukou' or  a  'rural  hukou':  in  particular,
      partly  because  of  the  difficulties  experienced  historically   by
      peasants in China, the family planning  scheme  is  more  relaxed  for
      those with a 'rural hukou'.

      (2) It is unhelpful (and a mistranslation  of  the  Chinese  term)  to
      describe the Chinese family planning scheme as a  'one-child  policy',
      given the current vast range of exceptions to  the  'one  couple,  one
      child'  principle.  Special  provision  is  made  for  'double-single'
      couples, where both are only children  supporting  their  parents  and
      their grandparents. The number of children authorised  for  a  married
      couple, ('authorised children') depends on the provincial  regulations
      and the individual circumstances of the  couple.  Additional  children
      are referred as 'unauthorised children'.

      (3) The Chinese family planning scheme  expects  childbirth  to  occur
      within marriage.  It  encourages  'late'  marriage  and  'late'  first
      births. 'Late' marriages are defined as age 25 (male) and 23  (female)
      and 'late' first births from age 24.  A birth permit  is  not  usually
      required for the first birth, but must be obtained  before  trying  to
      become pregnant with any further children. The Chinese family planning
      scheme also originally included a  requirement  for  four-year  'birth
      spacing'. With the  passage  of  time,  province  after  province  has
      abandoned that requirement. Incorrect birth  spacing,  where  this  is
      still a requirement, results in a financial penalty.

      (4) Breach of the Chinese family planning scheme is  a  civil  matter,
      not a criminal matter.

      Single-child families

      (5) Parents who  restrict  themselves  to  one  child  qualify  for  a
      "Certificate of Honour for Single-Child  Parents"  (SCP  certificate),
      which entitles them to a range of enhanced benefits  throughout  their
      lives,  from  priority  schooling,  free  medical  treatment,   longer
      maternity, paternity and honeymoon leave, priority access  to  housing
      and to retirement homes, and enhanced pension provision.

      Multiple-child families

      (6) Any second child, even if authorised,  entails  the  loss  of  the
      family's SCP certificate. Loss of a family's SCP results  in  loss  of
      privileged access to schools, housing, pensions and free  medical  and
      contraceptive  treatment.  Education  and  medical  treatment   remain
      available but are no longer free.

      (7) Where an unauthorised child is born,  the  family  will  encounter
      additional penalties. Workplace discipline for parents  in  employment
      is likely to include demotion or even loss of employment. In addition,
      a 'social upbringing charge' is  payable  (SUC),  which  is  based  on
      income, with a down payment of 50% and three years to pay the balance.



      (8) There are hundreds of  thousands  of  unauthorised  children  born
      every year.  Family planning officials are not entitled to  refuse  to
      register unauthorised children and there is no real risk of a  refusal
      to register a child. Payment for birth permits, for  the  registration
      of children, and the imposition of SUC charges for unauthorised births
      are  a  significant  source  of  revenue  for  local  family  planning
      authorities.  There is  a  tension  between  that  profitability,  and
      enforcement of the nationally imposed quota of births  for  the  town,
      county and province, exceeding which can harm officials' careers.

      (9) The financial consequences for a family of  losing  its  SCP  (for
      having more than one child) and/or of having SUC imposed  (for  having
      unauthorised children) and/or  suffering  disadvantages  in  terms  of
      access to education, medical treatment, loss of employment,  detriment
      to future employment etc will not,  in  general,  reach  the  severity
      threshold to amount to persecution or serious  harm  or  treatment  in
      breach of Article 3.

      (10) There are regular national campaigns  to  bring  down  the  birth
      rates in provinces and local areas which have exceeded  the  permitted
      quota.  Over-quota birth rates  threaten  the  employment  and  future
      careers of birth control officials in those regions, and  where  there
      is a national campaign, can result in large scale unlawful  crackdowns
      by local officials in a small number of provinces and areas.  In  such
      areas, during such large scale crackdowns, human rights abuses can and
      do occur, resulting  in  women,  and  sometimes  men,  being  forcibly
      sterilised  and  pregnant  women  having  their  pregnancies  forcibly
      terminated. The last such crackdown took place in spring 2010.

      Risk factors

      (11) In general, for female  returnees,  there  is  no  real  risk  of
      forcible sterilisation or forcible termination in China. However, if a
      female returnee who has already had her permitted quota of children is
      being returned at a time when there is a  crackdown  in  her   'hukou'
      area, accompanied by unlawful practices such  as  forced  abortion  or
      sterilisation, such a returnee would be  at  real   risk  of  forcible
      sterilisation or,  if  she  is  pregnant  at  the  time,  of  forcible
      termination of an unauthorised pregnancy.   Outside  of  these  times,
      such a female returnee may also be able to show  an  individual  risk,
      notwithstanding the absence of a general risk, where there is credible
      evidence that she, or members of her family remaining in  China,  have
      been threatened with, or have suffered, serious adverse  ill-treatment
      by reason of her breach of the family planning scheme.

      (12) Where a female returnee is at real risk of forcible sterilisation
      or termination of pregnancy in her  'hukou'  area,  such  risk  is  of
      persecution, serious harm and Article 3 ill-treatment. The  respondent
      accepted that such risk would be by reason  of  a  Refugee  Convention
      reason,  membership of a particular  social  group,  'women  who  gave
      birth in breach of China's family planning scheme'.

      (13) Male returnees do not, in general, face a real risk  of  forcible
      sterilisation, whether in their 'hukou' area or elsewhere,  given  the
      very low rate of sterilisation of males overall, and  the  even  lower
      rate of forcible sterilisation.

      Internal relocation

      (14) Where a real risk exists in the 'hukou' area, it may be  possible
      to avoid the risk by moving to a city. Millions  of  Chinese  internal
      migrants, male and female, live and work in cities where they  do  not
      hold an 'urban hukou'.  Internal migrant women are required to stay in
      touch with their  'hukou'  area  and  either  return  for  tri-monthly
      pregnancy tests or else send back test results.  The country  evidence
      does not indicate a real risk of effective pursuit of internal migrant
      women leading to forcible family planning  actions,  sterilisation  or
      termination,     taking     place      in      their      city      of
      migration. Therefore, internal relocation will, in almost all cases,
      avert the risk in the hukou area.  However,  internal  relocation  may
      not be safe where there is credible evidence of individual pursuit  of
      the returnee or her family, outside the 'hukou' area.  Whether  it  is
      unduly harsh to expect  an  individual  returnee  and  her  family  to
      relocate in this way will be a question of fact in each case.

   October 2012 UKBA Country of Origin Report

54. The respondent in October  2012  issued  a  revised  Country  of  Origin
   Report for China which has the following material  information  extracted
   from the 2011 United States Congressional-Executive  Committee  on  China
   report in relation to Hubei province:

           "26.15 Adding to this the US-CECC report 2011 stated:

           "The Commission noted that this year, in official  speeches  and
           government reports from a wide range of localities,  authorities
           also used the phrase "spare no efforts" (quanli yifu) to signify
           intensified enforcement measures and less restraint on officials
           who  oversee   coercive   population   planning   implementation
           measures. Between  November  2010  and  June  2011,  county  and
           township  governments  in  at   least   eight   provincial-level
           jurisdictions  (Shandong,  Anhui,   Gansu,   Guangdong,   Hunan,
           Guangxi, Hubei,  and  Jiangxi)  urged  officials  to  "spare  no
           efforts" in implementing family planning campaigns including, in
           some cases, the "two inspections and four procedures" (liangjian
           sishu) - or intrauterine device (IUD) inspections and  pregnancy
           inspections (the two inspections), IUD implants, first-trimester
           abortions, mid- to late-term abortions, and  sterilization  (the
           four procedures)." "

   Discussion

55. The appellant's skeleton argument was not expanded upon at the  hearing.
    There was some delay  by  the  respondent  in  these  proceedings:   the
   appellant sought asylum in November 2007 and the decision  to  refuse  to
   grant asylum was  made  on  20  August  2010.   During  that  period  the
   appellant's expected baby had been born in May 2008 and she  may  or  may
   not have reconciled with the husband to whom she  was  married  in  China
   seven or eight years earlier.  Delay from August 2010 to date was  caused
   by the appeals process.  There has been  no  change  in  the  appellant's
   situation in that period, save that her child has  begun  infant  school.
   This is not a case in which the delay is such that the  United  Kingdom's
   ability to control migration by a firm and fair immigration policy should
   be regarded as of lesser weight by reason of the respondent's conduct.

56. As regards the best interests of the children, there  was  no  expansion
   in oral argument of the  list  of  cases  relied  upon  in  the  skeleton
   argument.  In E-A, the Upper Tribunal held that:
      "(i)                 The correct starting  point  in  considering  the
           welfare and best interests of a young child would be that it  is
           in the best interests of a child to live with and be brought  up
           by his or her  parents,  subject  to  any  very  strong  contra-
           indication. Where it is in the best interests of a child to live
           with and be brought up by his or her parents, then  the  child's
           removal with his parents does  not  involve  any  separation  of
           family life.
      (ii)               Absent other factors, the reason why  a  period  of
           substantial  residence  as  a  child  may   become   a   weighty
           consideration in the balance of competing considerations is that
           in the  course  of  such  time  roots  are  put  down,  personal
           identities are developed, friendships are formed and  links  are
           made with the community outside the family unit. The  degree  to
           which these elements of private life are  forged  and  therefore
           the weight to be given to the passage of time will  depend  upon
           the facts in each case.
      (iii)             During a child's very early years, he or she will be
           primarily focused on self and the caring  parents  or  guardian.
           Long residence once the child is  likely  to  have  formed  ties
           outside the family is likely to have greater impact  on  his  or
           her well being."

57. This appellant's child is very young. The evidence of ties  outside  the
   family was not strong.  The decision in MK (India) cites ZH (Tanzania)  v
   Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department  [2011]  UKSC  4  and  E-A
   (Nigeria)  as the leading decisions on this question and adds nothing  to
   the reasoning on the facts of the present appeal. LD's case was that of a
   settled child, which is not the case here.

58. The passages relied upon in AX do not engage with the guidance given  at
   paragraph 191 of the decision, which is repeated in the italic words  set
   out above. Regarding the Tribunal's country guidance decision in AX,  the
   skeleton argument noted that this decision had not been in  existence  at
   the date of hearing. Paragraphs 81-82 , 87, 92-95 come from  the  summary
   of Dr  Sheehan's  evidence,   paragraphs  102-107  from  the  summary  of
   Professor  Fu's  evidence,  and   paragraph  124  from  the  respondent's
   submission  in  that  case.   The  remaining  paragraphs  come  from  the
   Tribunal's assessment of  the  evidence  but  omit,  in  each  case,  its
   conclusions.

59. There are two items in the country evidence produced by  the  appellant,
   all  of  which,  require  comment.   The  first  is  the  document   from
   LifeNews.com,  dated  7  October  2012,  attacking  the  United   Nations
   Population Fund (UNFPA)  for  its  support  of  the  'infamous  one-child
   policy' pursued by the Chinese government in Beijing.   It is prepared by
   an American pro-life organisation, and there is no clarity as to the date
   of the underlying research.  However, the evidence  recorded  is  broadly
   supportive of the Upper Tribunal's findings in AX.   In  particular,  the
   researcher notes that an SUC is payable by those who  have  out  of  plan
   children or who illegally take in such a child (as the appellant's mother
   in law's sister may have done), the fine  being  between  5-7  times  the
   annual income multiplier for a second child and between 7-9 times  for  a
   third child.

60. One woman and her husband had taken out a ten-year loan to pay  the  SUC
   for two out of plan daughters, and the husband had gone to  work  in  the
   city to repay  it.   Sums  of  20000-30000  RMB  (about  �2000-3000)  are
   mentioned but not, presumably, for persons with no annual income in China
   or outside it, as is the case with this appellant and her partner.

61. The report, 'Birth Registration  in  China:    Practices,  Problems  and
   Policies' compiled by the  Institute  for  Population  and  Developmental
   Studies, Xian Jiaotong University, Xian Shaanxi Province 710049 was  last
   revised on April 17 2009 and does not deal with the post-2010  regulatory
   system.  The underlying research and materials contain nothing later than
   2004 and cannot assist me very much on the situation now.

62. In relation to Article 8 ECHR, the  skeleton  argument  notes  that  the
   third child is foreign-born.  As already stated, Mr Hussain accepted that
   the third child would not be treated as born out of plan.

63. The appeal turns on its particular facts, which are that  the  appellant
   has three children, two daughters in China, one registered and  one  not,
   and one son born in the United Kingdom, and that she  is  estranged  from
   her husband although she still has some contact with him.  All members of
   the family are Chinese and none  has  any  leave  to  be  in  the  United
   Kingdom, although the appellant's claimed husband presently has temporary
   admission granted in December 2012, apparently to the same address as the
   appellant.  There is no other documentary evidence of their  residing  at
   that address such as bills, bank statements and so forth.

64. The appellant has been outside China since before the major  changes  to
   the policy in 2010.  The appellant and her  claimed  husband  are  not  a
   double-single couple but they do have a  rural  hukou.   She  is  not  an
   educated woman and although her fears of forced sterilisation in her home
   area are partially borne out in the CECC evidence included in the Country
   of Origin Report, that may well have been  a  question  of  bringing  the
   birth rate back within quota after the relaxation in 2008-2010  discussed
   in AX. There is no evidence of  recent  intensive  enforcement  in  Hubei
   province after the middle of 2011.

65. It appears from the appellant's evidence that both her  own  family  and
   that of her husband have rejected her  because  of  the  trouble  she  is
   perceived to have caused, and further, that she  is  estranged  from  her
   husband.

66. The appellant does not  appear  to  be  aware  that  officials  are  now
   required to register all children, whether regularly born  or  not;  that
   schooling is available  (for  a  fee)  for  unregistered  children;  that
   children born abroad are probably not regarded as having been born out of
   plan; and that millions of people live in cities away  from  their  hukou
   areas and work there.

67. The appellant's income, both in and out of  China,  is  zero.   She  has
   never worked.  Her husband's income is low: in China he was  a  labourer;
   in the United Kingdom, he worked for a time in a restaurant but  has  not
   done so since their child was born in 2008.  The multiplier for  any  SUC
   will be correspondingly low when she or they seek to register the  second
   and third children,  and  I  note  that  the  appellant  has  managed  to
   accumulate some savings.  I also note from AX  that  couples  registering
   children may be given several years to pay the SUC.  They  have  a  birth
   certificate for the foreign-born child.   They will of  course  lose  the
   SCP  Certificate  benefits  but  presumably  that  was  in  the  family's
   contemplation when they, at the urging of the appellant's parents-in-law,
   continued to try for a second and third child.

68. I find therefore that the appellant could return to China  and  register
   her son without difficulty and with only minimal SUC.  Since  her  second
   daughter has managed to survive thus far without  being  registered,  she
   may choose to leave things as they are, but if she seeks to register that
   daughter, she may have to pay further SUC.  She will  be  given  time  to
   pay. It seems likely that a family arrangement  has  been  made  for  the
   appellant's second daughter, in which case the  SUC  would  fall  on  her
   mother in law's sister for having informally adopted the child.

69. If the appellant is at risk of forced sterilisation  in  Hubei  province
   in 2013, which is not established by the evidence before  me,  I  do  not
   consider that it would be unduly harsh for her to go to live with her son
   in a large city such as Shanghai or Beijing.  She would have to work;  if
   her husband accompanied her,  he  could  work  and  support  them.   Paid
   education is available for second children  in  the  large  cities.   The
   appellant and her child are in good health and  both  speak  English,  he
   better than she, which would be an advantage.

Conclusions:

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.  I set aside the decision.

I  re-make  the  decision  in  the  appeal  by  dismissing  it  on   asylum,
humanitarian protection and human rights grounds.

Anonymity
The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule  45(4)(i)  of
the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
