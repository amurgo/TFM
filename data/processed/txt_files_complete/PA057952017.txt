For the Appellant:     Ms M C Benitez (for Coveat Solicitors)
For the Respondent:    Mr S Kotas (Senior Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of [SA], a citizen of Iran born [ ] 1989,  against
       the decision of the First-tier Tribunal of 9 August 2017  to  dismiss
       her appeal against the Respondent's refusal of her asylum claim on 24
       March 2016.


    2.  The  Appellant's  asylum  claim  was  based  on  her  conversion  to
       Christianity. Her elder brothers [H] and [M] had come to  the  UK  to
       avoid political harassment and military service respectively, in 2006
       and 2007. She remained in Iran with her mother, and from 2007 to 2013
       she observed the severe emotional stress her mother suffered. In 2012
       her mother applied to join her husband as  his  spouse,  telling  the
       Appellant to apply for a student visa. In 2013 her mother  travelled,
       having won an appeal against the  refusal  of  her  dependent  spouse
       application. The Appellant formed friendships with  some  Christians,
       and in the absence of  close  family  members  increasingly  came  to
       appreciate the Christian message,  participating  ever  more  in  the
       church's activities. She  had  read  St  Luke's  gospel  in  the  New
       Testament, the Vicar of her local church in Iran having  advised  her
       that  to  do  so  would  be  the  best  beginning  on  the  road   to
       Christianity.


    3. Since her arrival  in  the  United  Kingdom  she  had  suffered  from
       depression, and has received therapy from a consultant. She  had  met
       Adrian  Beavis,  vicar  of  St  Luke's  church,  which  she  attended
       regularly following her  arrival  here.  He  gave  live  evidence  to
       support her appeal.


    4.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  found  the  Appellant's  account  of  her
       Christian conversion to lack credibility:


    a) She had failed to answer simple questions as to how long she had
       attended the house church in Iran at interview despite multiple
       repetitions of the issue;


    b) It was not credible that she would state she was unaware of the
       dangers of attending the church when she had also given evidence that
       the family had attended the church in secret;


    c) It was not plausible that


         - Her conversion to Christianity would be prompted simply by a
           sense of loneliness: a religious conversion would be a life-
           changing event and could not have been motivated by such a
           simple cause;


         - She would have failed to make enquiries as to the welfare of her
           fellow worshippers including her friend [L], whose arrest
           triggered her own flight, particularly given that the group was
           sufficiently close-knit that its members had made arrangements
           that if one was arrested, the rest of the group would flee the
           country;


         - She had deleted the social media messages she had exchanged with
           her fellow Christians in Iran, this being evidence that would
           have been seen as far too important to a genuine asylum claim to
           be sacrificed simply to free up further memory;


    d) The family's immigration history counted against her credit: her
       father's asylum application had failed though he obtained settlement
       by other means, at which point his wife joined him, and the Appellant
       followed: only after her mother had arrived here did the Appellant
       herself claim to have converted to Christianity, and illegally enter
       the United Kingdom.


    5. Grounds of appeal (somewhat  reformulated  as  a  convenient  way  of
       making sense of them) argued that the First-tier  Tribunal  erred  in
       law in:


    a) Failing to take account of the Appellant's evidence that she
       struggled to understand the Home Office interpreter as they spoke
       Dari rather than Farsi, and that her former representative (who had
       subsequently faced legal proceedings for giving immigration advice
       whilst not qualified to do so) had simply confused things;


    b) Failing to take account of her interview record which showed that she
       only became aware of the dangers she faced when attending the church
       some time after she had first begun to do so;


    c) Failing to take account of the relevant consideration that it was
       unsurprising that a person might delete messages from their
       telephone;


    d) Failing to take account of the uncontroverted evidence of the vicar
       and the Appellant's attendance at his church;


    e) Failing to follow the guidance in the relevant authorities warning
       against the dangers of judging the validity of a person's religious
       beliefs;


    f) Failing to consider whether the Appellant would face persecution if
       she suppressed her religious beliefs, by analogy with the landmark
       decision in HJ (Iran), whether or not she faced more overt
       persecution via ill treatment for religious reasons.


    6. A judge of the First-tier Tribunal granted permission to appeal on 23
       October 2017, emphasising the ground of  appeal  as  to  whether  the
       interview was conducted in the Appellant's first language. A Rule  24
       response argued that the grounds amounted to  a  dispute  as  to  the
       factual conclusions of the First-tier Tribunal.


    7. Recognising the  amateurish  nature  of  the  grounds  of  appeal  as
       drafted, before me Ms Benitez concentrated her fire on those that had
       the  greater  prospect  of  success,  stressing  that  the  following
       features of the evidence had been wholly overlooked:


    a) At paragraph 29 of her witness statement the Appellant had explained
       that the interpreter at interview spoke Farsi rather than Dari; there
       were moments in the interview record where there was clearly overt
       problems with the interpretation, as where the interpreter was
       recorded as finding it necessary to repeat a question;


    b) Her witness statement also set out that she had found a legal
       advisor, Wiky by Law, from an Iranian newspaper, which had referred
       her ultimately to one Kamran Malik, who represented her until she
       became aware that he was not an appropriately regulated and
       registered immigration advisor. This was borne out by information
       subsequent to the First-tier Tribunal hearing, a letter from November
       2017 clearly showing the progress of the OISC's proceedings against
       him (though unfortunately it was not appropriately adduced before me
       via a Rule 15A notice). Her witness statement clearly set out several
       failings with his representation: Mr Malik gave the impression of
       being a staunch Muslim who was prejudiced against her because of her
       conversion, failed to give her a full copy of the reasons for refusal
       to comment upon, and did not prepare her for her interview with the
       Home Office;


    c) The Judge failed to take account of the witness statement evidence
       that she had attempted suicide following her arrival in the UK (she
       had given the details of her subsequent appointments with a
       psychologist at a Kensington address which she provided);


    d) The Judge failed to make findings on the corroborative value of the
       evidence from the witnesses who had attended to give live evidence,
       including two of her brothers and her parents, and the treatment of
       the vicar's evidence had been inadequate.


    8. In reply, Mr Kotas acknowledged that the failure  to  deal  with  the
       evidence of material witnesses was a significant error of law and  it
       was difficult to defend the dismissal  of  the  appeal.  However,  he
       emphasised that he did not accept that the other  grounds  of  appeal
       were made out: the allegation of representative error  had  not  been
       definitively shown as  having  made  a  material  difference  to  the
       outcome of the appeal, and nor was there any clear  evidence  on  the
       face of the interview record to show that the Appellant had not  been
       able to fully understand the interpreter.


  Findings and reasons


    9. As I indicated at the hearing, it seems to me that a failure to  make
       findings on the evidence of material witnesses is likely to be  fatal
       in the vast majority of asylum  appeals,  which  must  be  approached
       applying the appropriate anxious scrutiny. As Carnwath  LJ  explained
       in YH  [2010] EWCA Civ 116 that term "has by usage  acquired  special
       significance as underlining the very special human context  in  which
       such cases are brought, and the need for decisions to show  by  their
       reasoning that  every  factor  which  might  tell  in  favour  of  an
       applicant has been properly taken into account."


   10. No finding whatsoever was made on the  evidence  of  the  Appellant's
       family members. Although  the  vicar's  evidence  is  mentioned,  the
       Tribunal rejected it without giving any reasons  for  preferring  its
       own analysis of the  Appellant's  genuineness  without  weighing  his
       opinion evidence in the balance. It is not possible to say  what  the
       reaction of the First-tier Tribunal would have been to  the  evidence
       of the Appellant herself had it taken into account  that  potentially
       corroborative evidence. Given that central and  fundamental  failing,
       it is clearly necessary that the appeal must be re-heard.


   11. Given the discussion of other issues  in  the  appeal,  it  is  worth
       drawing out some other elements of the case.


   12. Firstly, there is the challenge to the interview record. Mr Kotas was
       astute to emphasise that there was no patent evidence  to  show  that
       the Appellant had misunderstood the interpreter, given she had signed
       the interview record on the basis  of  assent  to  having  understood
       them. However, it is rather difficult  to  place  much  weight  on  a
       statement that an interviewee has understood the interpreter when the
       record is not read back to them and when they are presumably  unaware
       of precisely what it is that the interpreter  translated  until  such
       time as a competent representative  reviews  the  record  with  them.
       Their statement is essentially an act of faith, and one  can  readily
       understand that natural  deference  to  authority  may  prevent  them
       raising a concern as to the  interpreter  until  they  have  had  the
       opportunity to check things. In  many  appeals,  one  could  look  to
       whether there was a complaint once  the  interview  record  was  read
       back, in order to provide credible  corroboration,  pre-decision,  of
       the possibility of misunderstanding.  However,  given  the  complaint
       against the person purporting to  represent  the  Appellant  at  that
       time, it would seem untenable to hold that against her.


   13. Secondly, there is the issue regarding the professional standards  of
       the Appellant's former representative. A person unfamiliar  with  the
       developed law of international protection status determination  might
       wonder how it is that the failings of  a  representative  could  lead
       appellate proceedings to  be  flawed,  but  of  course  it  is  well-
       established in this jurisdiction that the rule in Al-Mehdawi [1990] 1
       AC 876 (that a  procedural  failure  caused  by  an  appellant's  own
       representative did not lead to an appeal being in breach of the rules
       of natural justice) does not apply with full  rigour  in  asylum  and
       human rights appeals: see for example FP (Iran) [2007] EWCA  Civ  13.
       Complaints are often made against former legal  representatives,  and
       the Tribunal often looks to whether  or  not  a  complaint  has  been
       pursued against them. However, if  the  statutory  regulatory  bodies
       have themselves initiated proceedings  against  an  individual,  that
       clearly supports a prima facie case of their work  being  inadequate,
       and in this appeal, the Appellant  had  given  clear  evidence  of  a
       number of failings in her original advisor's casework.  That  clearly
       demands reasoned engagement by the First-tier Tribunal. Any judge who
       re-hears the appeal  should  have  the  benefit  of  more  up-to-date
       evidence of the situation than did their their predecessor.


   14. Finally, although the issue was not ventilated further at the hearing
       before me because of Mr Kotas' pragmatic stance on the overlooking of
       the witnesses, any future Judge who  reviews  the  evidence  in  this
       appeal should have regard to the relevant  principles  identified  by
       the authorities when assessing  the  Appellant's  religious  beliefs.
       Lord Nicholls stated in Williamson [2005] 2 AC 246,  �22:


           "When the genuineness of a claimant's professed belief is an
           issue in the proceedings the court will inquire into and decide
           this issue as a question of fact. This is a limited inquiry. ...
           emphatically, it is not for the court to embark on an inquiry
           into the asserted belief and judge its 'validity' by some
           objective standard such as the source material upon which the
           claimant founds his belief on the orthodox teaching of the
           religion in question or the extent to which the claimant's
           belief conforms to or differs from the views of others
           professing the same religion. Freedom of religion protects the
           subjective belief of an individual ... religious belief is
           intensely personal and can easily vary from one individual to
           another. Each individual is at liberty to hold his own religious
           beliefs, however irrational or inconsistent they may seem to
           some, however surprising."


   15. In the same vein, the Administrative Court in SA (Iran)  [2012]  EWHC
       2575 (Admin) warned that "it is a dangerous  thing  for  anyone,  and
       perhaps especially a judge, to peer into what  some  call  a  man  or
       woman's soul to assess whether a professed faith is  genuinely  held,
       and especially not when it was and is agreed that she was  and  is  a
       frequent participant in church services."


   16. Having regard to the principles identified in Williamson and  applied
       in  AS  (Iran),  a  Judge  should  be  relatively  circumspect   when
       adjudicating upon the beliefs of a person who espouses adherence to a
       particular religion. An assertion  of  Christian  faith  is  not,  of
       course, immune from assessment as to its veracity, but the assessment
       needs to take account of the  various  dangers  identified  in  those
       authorities as to the propriety of making particular  assumptions  as
       to why an individual may come to adhere to a particular belief system
       and to the manner in which they exercise their religion.

Decision


The appeal is allowed,  as  there  was  a  material  error  of  law  in  the
reasoning of the First-tier Tribunal. The appeal is remitted to  the  First-
tier Tribunal for re-hearing afresh.
