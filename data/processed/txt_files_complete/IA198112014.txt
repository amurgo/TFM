Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr K Waterfall, sponsor
For the respondent:    Mr S Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Feliberta Cabayao Arsenio, date of birth 28.3.50,  is  a
    citizen of the Philippines.

 2. This is her appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Metzer promulgated 30.9.14, dismissing  her  appeal  against  the
    decision of the respondent to refuse leave  to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom outside the Immigration Rules on the basis of Article  8  ECHR.
    The Judge heard the appeal on 16.9.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Colyer  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    20.11.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 21.1.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Metzer should be set aside.

 6. In essence, the grounds of appeal contend that the First-tier  Tribunal
    erred in law with regards to issue  of  proportionality  and  the  best
    interests of the children  and  in  particular  the  appellant's  close
    relationship and bond with her grandchild Summer,  one  of  a  pair  of
    twins born prematurely to the sponsor and his wife on  25.8.12.  It  is
    suggested that the mental and emotional well-being of the children will
    be adversely affected by the removal of  the  appellant,  supported  by
    written  evidence  from  witnesses  in  the  health  care  or   medical
    professions.

 7. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Colyer considered  it  arguable
    that the reasoning of the decision  was  insufficient  to  provide  the
    parties sufficient detail as to the principles on  which  the  Tribunal
    has acted and the reasons leading to the decision,  so  that  they  are
    able to understand why it reached that decision. The reasons  need  not
    be elaborate, and need not deal with every argument presented. "In this
    appeal it is apparent that a number of issues were raised including the
    best  interests  of  the  appellant's  grandchildren.  The  judge   has
    attempted to make findings on all the  issues  in  only  one  paragraph
    (paragraph 12).  It  is  open  to  argument  as  to  whether  this  was
    sufficient in dealing with the essential issues raised in the appeal."

 8. The relevant history is  set  out  in  the  papers  but  in  short  the
    appellant came to  the  UK  as  a  visitor  assist  her  daughter,  the
    sponsor's wife at the  premature  birth  of  their  twin  daughters  on
    25.8.12. It is said  and  not  disputed  that  the  appellant  provided
    immense emotional and caring support to the family during this  period.
    She then returned to her own husband, other children and  grandchildren
    in the Philippines, when the twins were about 6 months  old.  There  is
    also an older child, now 8 years of age. She returned to the UK  again,
    as soon as it was possible, in September 2013, when the twins were just
    over a year old, and has remained here since.   Mrs  Waterfall  has  no
    other family in the UK to turn to for support.  It  is  said  that  the
    parents struggled desperately and were at breaking point. They claim to
    need the assistance of the appellant, and want her to  stay  until  the
    twins are about 4 years of age when they can explain  why  she  has  to
    return to the Philippines. Mr Waterfall did not accept that  separation
    at that age would likely be far more disturbing  than  separation  now,
    when the twins are only two years of age and will in due course have no
    independent recollection of life at the age of two. Mr Waterfall relied
    on professional studies as  to  the  effect  on  mental,  physical  and
    emotional health of separation of a child from its  carer  at  a  young
    age.

 9. On investigation with Mr Waterfall, he and his wife are  in  reasonably
    good health, as are the twins. There is in fact no relevant  mental  or
    physical health issue at all. As he explained it to me, they as parents
    felt that they could not cope with twins and feel that they needed  the
    help of the appellant. In consequence, she had developed a very  close,
    almost parental bond with one of the twins, because she had  taken  the
    primary care of that child which Mrs Waterfall has  taken  the  primary
    care of the other. There are no other relevant factors other than those
    set out in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

10. I am satisfied  that  the  judge  took  into  account  everything  that
    possibly could be urged on the appellant's behalf. No issue  was  taken
    with the fact that close bond had been created between grandmother  and
    grandchild, and the judge accepted that there was family life and  that
    her removal would engage Article 8. But the fact remains that there  is
    absolutely nothing exceptional on the facts of this  case.  I  fail  to
    understand why the Waterfalls are in any  different  situation  to  any
    other family with three children, or who have been blessed with  twins.
    No particular reasons have been advanced as to why they as parents  are
    unable to cope without the assistance of the appellant.

11. It follows that it was entirely open to the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    to assess all of these factors  and  to  consider  the  proportionality
    balancing exercise. I can see nothing that has been taken into  account
    that should not have been, and nothing that should have been taken into
    account but has not. The conclusion is fully justified in the  decision
    with cogent reasons, as set out in ï¿½12. It is  not  necessary  for  the
    judge to set these matter out at length,  provided  it  is  clear  that
    there has been a fair consideration of the  relevant  factors.  In  the
    circumstances, I can find no error of  law  either  for  inadequacy  of
    reasoning or any  other  reason  in  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

Conclusion & Decision:

12. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.




Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: the appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
