For the Respondent:    Mrs Pettersen, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Appellant's appeal against the decision of  Judge  Grimshaw
    made following a hearing at Bradford on 4th August 2014.



Background

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 28th December 1975.   He
    appealed against the decision of the Respondent,  made  on  29th  April
    2014, to refuse to grant him a residence card as  confirmation  of  his
    right of residence as a family  member  of  an  EEA  national  who  was
    residing in an EEA State as a worker  or  self-employed  person  before
    returning to the UK.

 3. Regulation 9 sets out the conditions which are to be satisfied for  the
    issuing of a residence card.  The conditions are that -

          a) P is residing in an EEA state as  a  worker  or  self-employed
             person or was so residing before returning to the UK;

          b) If the family member of P is P's spouse or civil  partner  the
             parties are living together in the EEA state  or  had  entered
             into  the  marriage  or  civil  partnership  and  were  living
             together in the EEA state before the British citizen  returned
             to the UK; and

          c) The centre of P's life has transferred to the EEA state  where
             P resided as a worker or self-employed person.

    Factors relevant to whether the centre of P's life has  transferred  to
    another EEA state include -

          d) The period of residence in the EEA state as a worker or  self-
             employed person;

          e) The location of P's principal residence;

          f) The degree of integration of P in the EEA state.

 4. The Respondent did not accept that the EEA national  Sponsor  had  been
    working as a self-employed whilst residing in Ireland.  The couple  had
    lived outside the UK for  less  than  a  year  and  had  no  family  or
    financial ties or property owned in Ireland.

 5. The Judge found the evidence to be discrepant.  She accepted  that  the
    couple had arrived in Ireland on 30th May 2013 but was  unclear  as  to
    why a tenancy agreement had been signed five days later since  she  was
    told that for the first four weeks they were living with relatives. The
    Sponsor had claimed to have arranged rented  accommodation  only  after
    she started work as a cleaner in July 2013.   Moreover,  the  Appellant
    had said that he and his wife had no intention of  settling  there  and
    did not plan to do so until two weeks after the date of their arrival.

 6. Mrs Parveen's evidence of her work activity  was  wholly  unpersuasive.
    Her start dates were inconsistent with each other.  The letter from the
    accountant said that she started trading on 8th July  2013  and  ceased
    trading on 19th December 2013, a period of less than six months.  There
    were no invoices or receipts nor any evidence of a tax return.

 7. The Judge said that she was aware that the authorities in  Ireland  had
    issued a residence certificate based on the claim that the  Appellant's
    wife was economically active.  It seemed that they were content  to  do
    so on the basis of the tenancy  agreement  together  with  confirmation
    from the accountant that he was acting as her tax agent  and  a  letter
    from his saying that her expected turnover was likely  to  be  E15,000.
    However, by the date of the letter, she had ceased trading  two  months
    earlier with a recorded profit of only ï¿½2,430 and had been economically
    inactive thereafter.

 8. Moreover there was no persuasive  evidence  to  show  that  either  the
    Appellant nor his wife had  integrated  into  the  local  community  in
    Ireland or had any real attachments to the country.  They had come  for
    a holiday on  30th  May  2013  and  neither  had  visited  the  country
    previously.  The total time there spanned less  than  a  year  and  the
    claimed period of self-employment was even shorter.

 9. She concluded that Mrs Parveen was not meaningfully engaged as a  self-
    employed person within the meaning of Regulation 9 whilst  resident  in
    another EEA state.

The grounds of application

10. The Appellant sought permission to  appeal  on  the  grounds  that  the
    judge's decision was against the weight of evidence.  The Appellant had
    been issued with a five year residence card in Ireland as the spouse of
    a British citizen exercising EU treaty rights.  During the eight  month
    period of stay the  Appellant's  wife  had  moved  the  centre  of  her
    residence to Ireland and had no house or employment commitments in  the
    UK.  Neither did she claim any benefits during that period.   When  she
    registered herself as self-employed there her  intention  was  to  live
    there for an indefinite period.   She  had  produced  evidence  of  her
    residence such as a tenancy agreement, an accountant's letter,  utility
    bills, bank statements, etc.  The oral  evidence  was  very  clear  and
    there were no inconsistencies in the statements.

11. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge Mailer for the reasons stated
    in the grounds on 2nd September 2014.

Submissions

12. Mr Janjua relied on his grounds  and  repeated  that  there  was  clear
    evidence before the Judge which should have enabled her to find in  his
    favour.  He recited the documentary evidence which she had produced and
    submitted that the Judge had erred in law by failing to provide  proper
    reasons for her decision.

13. Mrs Pettersen submitted that the grounds did not challenge the negative
    credibility findings.  The Judge properly took into account all of  the
    evidence before her and reached a decision open to her.





Findings and Conclusions

14. There is no error of law in this decision.  The  grounds  amount  to  a
    mere disagreement with it and are an attempt to re-argue the case.

15. The Judge analysed all of the documentary evidence and  reached  proper
    conclusions open to her.  She outlined the discrepancies  in  the  oral
    evidence.  The Appellant's wife had been in Ireland  for  a  relatively
    short period of  time.   The  evidence  of  meaningful  employment  was
    scanty.

16. She bore in mind the fact that a residence certificate had been  issued
    by the authorities in Ireland but was clear as to why she  herself  had
    come to a different conclusion.

17. No error is disclosed in either the grounds or the submissions.

Decision

18. The Judge's decision stands.  The Appellant's appeal is dismissed.
