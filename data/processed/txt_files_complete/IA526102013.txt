                               MR SHAHZAD KHAN

                                                                  Respondent
Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Tarlow (Home Office Presenting
      Officer)
For the Respondent:    Unrepresented


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. Whereas the  respondent  is  the  appealing  party,  I  shall,  in  the
    interests of convenience and consistency, replicate the nomenclature of
    the decision at first instance.


 2. The appellant, born January 1,  1988  is  a  citizen  of  Pakistan.  On
    February 7, 2011 he was granted leave to enter the United Kingdom as  a
    Tier 4 student until February 29, 2012. This leave was  extended  until
    July 7, 2014 but on May 14, 2013 he was given  notice  that  his  leave
    would be curtailed as at July 13, 2013. due to the fact his Sponsor was
    no longer acceptable. On May 23, 2013 he submitted his application  and
    at page 37 of the application form  he  stated  he  would  provide  his
    Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) "later  on".  He  was  not
    issued with this document until August 15, 2013.

 3. The respondent refused his application on November 20, 2013 and at  the
    same time a decision to remove under section  47  of  the  Immigration,
    Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 (as amended) was taken.

 4. On December 10, 2013 the appellant appealed under Section 82(1) of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  arguing  the  application
    should have been allowed under the  Immigration  rules  and  article  8
    ECHR.

 5. The matter was listed before  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Fox
    (hereinafter referred to  as  "the  FtTJ")  on  June  24,  2014.  In  a
    determination promulgated on July 16, 2014  he  remitted  the  decision
    back to the respondent and made no decision on article 8 ECHR.

 6. The respondent appealed that decision on July 16, 2014.  Permission  to
    appeal was granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Hollingsworth on
    September 11, 2014. He found the FtTJ may have erred  for  the  reasons
    set out in the respondent's grounds.

 7. The appellant was in attendance  at  the  hearing.  He  was  no  longer
    represented.

    SUBMISSIONS ON ERROR OF LAW


 8. Mr Tarlow adopted the grounds of appeal  and  submitted  the  FtTJ  had
    erred because  the  respondent  was  under  no  obligation  to  request
    information when the appellant himself has clearly stated there was  no
    such document. The document  concerned  only  came  into  existence  on
    August 15, 2013 which was of course after his  leave  expired,  in  any
    event. If there was an error I was invited to dismiss the appeal  under
    both the Immigration Rules and article 8, if appropriate.

 9. Mr Khan argued that it was not his fault that his sponsor was no longer
    trusted and he had not had sufficient time to pass a  required  English
    exam and obtain his CAS although he emphasised, more than once, that he
    intended to return to Pakistan as soon as he  finished  his  course  in
    January 2015.

    ASSESSMENT OF ERROR IN LAW.

10. The FtTJ found at paragraph [29] that no valid CAS  had  been  provided
    and his appeal must fail. That should have been the end of  the  matter
    but the FtTJ considered case law and incorrectly applied the law.

11. The FtTJ applied Khatel and others (Section  85A:effect  of  continuing
    application) [2013] UKUT 00044 when he should have applied the Court of
    appeal decision of Raju, Khatel and Others v SSHD [2013] EWCA  Civ  754
    in which the Court of Appeal made it clear that AQ  (Pakistan)  v  SSHD
    [2011] EWCA Civ 833 was "not  authority  for  the  proposition...  that
    applications were "made" throughout the period starting with  the  date
    of their submission and finishing with the date of the decisions".  The
    date of the application is governed  by  Rule  37  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.  Paragraph  34G  precluded  the   concept   of   a   'continuing
    application' which started when it was first submitted and concluded at
    the date of the decision either  of  the  Secretary  of  State  or,  on
    appeal, of a Tribunal.

12. The fact the  Court  of  Appeal  had  overturned  the  original  Khatel
    decision was  something  he  should  have  taken  judicial  notice  of.
    Consequently, there was no legal basis to return the application to the
    respondent and his decision contains a material error.

13. I have remade the decision and having taken into account the FtTJ found
    the appellant did not meet the Rules I dismiss  the  appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules.

14. In respect of article 8 ECHR the Immigration Rules set  out  article  8
    ECHR and whilst the appellant  has  extended  family  here  his  family
    remains in Pakistan and his private life amounts to his  studies  here.
    He does not meet the requirements of either Appendix  FM  or  paragraph
    276ADE HC 395.

15. As the appellant has not met the Immigration Rules I have  to  consider
    whether there are any  exceptional  or  compelling  circumstances  that
    would make removal unjustifiably harsh. I have applied the approach set
    out in R (Nagre) v SSHD [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin); MF  (Nigeria)  v  SSHD
    [2013] EWCA Civ  1192;  Gulshan  (Article  8  -  New  Rules  -  Correct
    Approach) [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC); Shahzad (Article 8: legitimate  aim)
    [2014] UKUT 00085 (IAC) and MM (Lebanon) & Ors, R (on  the  application
    of) v Secretary of State for the Home Department & Anor [2014] EWCA Civ
    985)).

16. I am dealing with an appellant who could  meet  the  Rules  if  he  had
    provided the correct documentation. In Nasim  and  others  (Article  8)
    [2014] UKUT 00025 (IAC) the Tribunal stated at paragraphs [20] to [21]

           20. We therefore agree with Mr Jarvis that  [57]  of  Patel  and
           Others is a significant exhortation from the Supreme Court to re-
           focus attention on the nature and purpose of Article 8  and,  in
           particular, to recognise its limited utility  to  an  individual
           where one has moved along the  continuum,  from  that  Article's
           core area of operation towards what might be  described  as  its
           fuzzy penumbra. The limitation arises, both from  what  will  at
           that point normally be the tangential effect on  the  individual
           of the proposed interference and  from  the  fact  that,  unless
           there are particular reasons to reduce the  public  interest  of
           enforcing immigration controls, that interest will  consequently
           prevail in striking the proportionality balance  (even  assuming
           that stage is reached).


           21. In conclusion on this first general matter, we find that the
           nature of the right asserted by each of the appellants, based on
           their desire, as former students, to undertake a period of post-
           study work in the United Kingdom, lies at the outer  reaches  of
           cases requiring an affirmative answer to the second of the  five
           "Razgar" questions and that, even if such an affirmative  answer
           needs to be  given,  the  issue  of  proportionality  is  to  be
           resolved decisively in favour of the respondent, by reference to
           her functions as the  guardian  of  the  system  of  immigration
           controls, entrusted to her by Parliament."

17. The appellant had time to submit his application. He took no  steps  to
    seek additional time  and  he  failed  to  meet  the  Rules.  Whilst  I
    acknowledge his course is due  to  end  in  January  2015  and  he  has
    incurred costs there is nothing exceptional or  compelling  that  would
    make removal unjustifiably harsh. It is of course open to him  to  seek
    entry clearance to complete his course but I find  no  basis  to  allow
    this appeal under article 8 ECHR.

    DECISION


18. There is a material error of law and I set aside the decision. I remake
    the decision and dismiss the appeal under  the  Immigration  Rules  and
    article 8 ECHR.

19. Under Rule 14(1) The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (as
    amended) the  appellant  can  be  granted  anonymity  throughout  these
    proceedings, unless and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise. No
    order has been made and no request for an order was submitted to me.
