Representation

For the appellant   Alasdair Mackenzie (counsel instructed by Owens
Stevens)
For the respondent  Mr Ian Jarvis

                            RULING AND DIRECTIONS

 1. This is an appeal, by the respondent to the  original  appeal,  against
    the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Anthony  Higgins),
    sitting at Taylor House on 9 February  2014,  to  allow  a  deportation
    appeal by a citizen of Jamaica, born 28 October 1993.

 2. History   The appellant was brought to this country by his mother on 26
    June 1994, on a visit visa, followed by a student visa,  which  expired
    on 31 October 1995, and, apart from two visits to Jamaica,  has  stayed
    here ever since, without leave till he was given  indefinite  leave  to
    remain (with his mother and half-brother) on 23 July 2008. In  2012  he
    committed two separate offences: on 23 April  he  supplied  some  crack
    cocaine to an undercover police officer, and, apparently while on  bail
    for that, was involved in a violent disorder on 3 September. On 17 June
    2013 he was sentenced to 30 months' detention  in  a  young  offenders'
    institution [YOI] for the drugs offence, with  3  months  consecutively
    for the violent disorder. Credit totalling 230 days was to be given for
    the time he had spent on remand in custody or under curfew, but he  was
    still in detention when a notice of intention to deport was  served  on
    him on 24 September and a deportation order on 5  March  2014,  against
    which he appealed.

 3. For some reason  the  appellant  was  released,  rather  than  detained
    pending deportation,  at  the  end  of  the  custodial  period  of  his
    sentence, and it was then that he formed a relationship  with  J  G,  a
    British citizen who at the date of the first-tier hearing was expecting
    his child in August this year. They were not living  together,  as  the
    appellant's licence conditions required him to live with his mother. On
    7 September, when this case first came before me, there was no  further
    information about the birth of the child, as not only did the appellant
    not answer the  notice  of  hearing  in  the  Upper  Tribunal,  but  Mr
    Mackenzie was unable to make telephone contact with his solicitors when
    he failed to appear. Later he explained, through them, that he had come
    to the Royal Courts of Justice, it would seem after I had had the  case
    called several times; but he had been put off by the apparently  closed
    court.

 4. Law and Rules   The potentially relevant legislation and Rules  are  as
    follows:  sections  117B  and  C  were  inserted  in  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  by  the  Immigration  Act  2014  and
    paragraphs 398 - 399A appear in the current Immigration Rules. As  they
    are relatively new, and not so simple, it is best to set  them  out  in
    full, so far as they have any  bearing  on  either  the  error  of  law
    argument or what follows.

       117B Article 8: public  interest  considerations  applicable  in  all
       cases
       (1) The maintenance of effective  immigration  controls  is  in  the
          public interest.
       (2) It is in the public interest, and in particular in the interests
          of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that persons who
          seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom
          are able to speak English, because persons who can speak English-
           (a) are less of a burden on taxpayers, and
           (b) are better able to integrate into society.
       (3) It is in the public interest, and in particular in the interests
          of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that persons who
          seek to enter or remain in  the  United  Kingdom  are  financially
          independent, because such persons-
           (a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and
           (b) are better able to integrate into society.
       (4) Little weight should be given to-
           (a) a private life, or
           (b) a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,
          that is established by a person at a time when the  person  is  in
          the United Kingdom unlawfully.
       (5) Little weight should be given to a private life established by a
          person  at  a  time  when  the  person's  immigration  status   is
          precarious
       (6) In the case of a person who is not liable  to  deportation,  the
          public interest does not require the person's removal where-
        a) the person has a genuine and  subsisting  parental  relationship
           with a qualifying child, and
        b) it would not be reasonable to expect  the  child  to  leave  the
           United Kingdom.


       117C Article 8: additional considerations in cases involving  foreign
       criminals
       (1) The deportation of foreign criminals is in the public interest.
       (2) The more serious the offence committed by  a  foreign  criminal,
          the greater is the public interest in deportation of the criminal.
       (3) In the case of  a  foreign  criminal  ("C")  who  has  not  been
          sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years or  more,  the
          public interest requires C's deportation  unless  Exception  1  or
          Exception 2 applies.
       (4)  Exception 1 applies where-
          (a)        C has been lawfully resident in the United Kingdom  for
             most of C's life,
          (b)        C is socially and culturally integrated in  the  United
             Kingdom, and
          (c)        there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to  C's
             integration into the country to  which  C  is  proposed  to  be
             deported.
       (5) Exception 2  applies  where  C  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
          relationship  with  a  qualifying  partner,  or  a   genuine   and
          subsisting parental relationship with a qualifying child, and  the
          effect of C's deportation on the partner or child would be  unduly
          harsh.
       (6) In the case of a person who is not liable  to  deportation,  the
          public interest does not require the person's removal where -
          (a) the person has a genuine and subsisting parental  relationship
          with a qualifying child, and
          (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the child  to  leave  the
          United Kingdom.
       (7) The considerations in subsections (1) to (6)  are  to  be  taken
          into account where a court or tribunal is considering  a  decision
          to deport a foreign criminal only to the extent  that  the  reason
          for the decision  was  the  offence  or  offences  for  which  the
          criminal has been convicted.

 5. Much of the relevant Rules is to similar effect, but again they are set
    out, so far as they may be involved in the decisions to be made:

       398. Where a person claims that their deportation would  be  contrary
       to  the  UK's  obligations  under  Article  8  of  the  Human  Rights
       Convention, and
    a) ...
    b) the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to the  public
       good and in the public interest because they have been  convicted  of
       an offence for  which  they  have  been  sentenced  to  a  period  of
       imprisonment of less than 4 years but at least 12 months; ...
    c) ...
       the Secretary of State in assessing that claim will consider  whether
       paragraph 399 or 399A  applies  and,  if  it  does  not,  the  public
       interest in deportation will only  be  outweighed  by  other  factors
       where there are very compelling circumstances over  and  above  those
       described in paragraphs 399 and 399A.

       399. This paragraph applies where paragraph 398 (b) or (c) applies if
       -
    a) the person has a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with  a
       child under the age of 18 years who is in the UK, and
           i) the child is a British Citizen; or
        ii) the child has lived in the UK continuously for at least  the  7
            years  immediately  preceding  the  date  of  the   immigration
            decision; and in either case
            (a) it would be unduly harsh for  the  child  to  live  in  the
            country to which the person is to be deported; and
            (b) it would be unduly harsh for the child to remain in the  UK
            without the person who is to be deported; or

    b) the person has a genuine and subsisting relationship with  a  partner
       who is in the UK and is a British Citizen or settled in the UK, and
         i)  the  relationship  was  formed  at  a  time  when  the  person
            (deportee) was in the UK lawfully and their immigration  status
            was not precarious; and
        ii) it would be unduly harsh  for  that  partner  to  live  in  the
            country to which the person  is  to  be  deported,  because  of
            compelling circumstances over  and  above  those  described  in
            paragraph EX.2. of Appendix FM; and
       iii) it would be unduly harsh for that partner to remain in  the  UK
            without the person who is to be deported.

       399A. This paragraph applies where paragraph 398(b) or (c) applies if
       -
       a) the person has been lawfully resident in the UK for  most  of  his
          life; and
       b) he is socially and culturally integrated in the UK; and
       (c)  there would be very significant obstacles to his integration
       into the country to which it is proposed he is deported.

 6. Issues   As Judge Higgins noted at paragraphs 40 - 42 of his  decision,
    neither paragraph 399 nor 399A of the Rules applied in this  case,  for
    reasons which will already be clear  from  the  history.  However  they
    remain of some relevance, because of paragraph 398. In a case  such  of
    this, to which that  paragraph  applies,  the  judge  has  to  consider
    whether there are 'very compelling circumstances over and  above  those
    described in paragraphs 399 and 399A'; and that is what  Judge  Higgins
    set out to do at paragraph 43. The issue for me is whether his approach
    to that question was in accordance with the law or not.

 7. Permission to appeal was given in  general  terms  on  that  point,  on
    grounds, not by Mr Jarvis, which took a number of detailed ones, not as
    clearly as he argued  the  case.  Mr  Mackenzie  had  had  Mr  Jarvis's
    skeleton argument before the hearing began, but left it till the  start
    of his own submissions to raise the question of whether the points  set
    out in it were covered in the grounds or the grant of permission. As he
    acknowledged in response to my query, none of them had come in any  way
    as a surprise to counsel of his very considerable  experience;  and  he
    did not specify any as ones which Mr Jarvis should not  be  allowed  to
    argue.

 8. While it is important that the ground-rules for Upper Tribunal hearings
    should be set in advance as far as possible, so as not to take  parties
    by surprise, or to waste the Tribunal's time at the hearing, the latter
    consideration makes it equally important not to spend any  more  of  it
    than absolutely necessary in considering in detail whether  points  are
    or are not covered by the grant or the grounds, and I do not propose to
    do so here.

 9. Judge's decision       Judge Higgins was faced with a young man of  20,
    who had spent very nearly all his life in  this  country;  but  he  had
    served a 30 months' sentence for dealing in class  'A'  drugs,  with  a
    short consecutive one for an offence of violence. He had a girl-friend,
    with a child on the way; but he had got together with the mother  after
    he had been told he was liable to deportation; and there  could  be  no
    existing relationship with an unborn child. To allow  his  appeal,  the
    judge had to find not only  'very  compelling  circumstances  over  and
    above those described in paragraphs 399 and 399A'; but a  path  through
    the obstacles set up in ss. 117B - C.

10. The judge referred to s.  117B  at  paragraph  53,  but  did  not  deal
    expressly with its provisions at all. He did not  specifically  mention
    the stage at which the appellant had got together with his baby-mother;
    but it is  possible  to  read  his  paragraph  48  as  discounting  his
    relationship with her,  as  short-lived  so  far  and  potentially  not
    lasting. That might suggest that he gave  little  weight  to  it,  even
    without reminding himself that he was bound to do so,  in  view  of  s.
    117B (4) and (5).

11. The appellant's  relationship  with  his  family  was  also  of  course
    important for the judge: here there might well be something to be  said
    for Mr Jarvis's point that much of this had been built up before he, or
    any of them had indefinite leave to remain. It might on the other  hand
    be said that that had little to do with real life:  the  appellant  was
    born into his family back in Jamaica, came here with  them  as  a  very
    small child, and the Home Office recognized  the  situation  by  giving
    them all indefinite leave to remain in 2008. I may have  to  return  to
    this point on s. 117B (4) later; but I am not treating it here  as  one
    on which the judge was clearly wrong in law.

12. The other important point for the judge,  apart  from  the  appellant's
    long residence and claimed rehabilitation, was of course the  child  on
    the way. That child was not yet  a  sentient  being,  and  his  or  her
    interests were not to be considered in their own  right.  His  mother's
    pregnancy was of course a  factor  for  serious  consideration  in  the
    context of the appellant's relationship with her; but by s.  117B  (5),
    that was to be given  little  weight  in  any  event.  The  significant
    finding which the judge made on the child came in the last sentence  of
    paragraph 48: "... [the appellant's] removal is likely to deny him  the
    opportunity to form a close parental bond with his child during his  or
    her early years".

13. Error of law    Whatever might be said about such a finding in the case
    of a child already in being, when in any case  it  could  no  doubt  be
    justified by reference to the child's own best interests, that was  not
    the situation before Judge Higgins. I do not think he was  entitled  to
    deal with the situation at the date of the hearing before him,  as  his
    approach obliged him to, in terms of an opportunity that might (barring
    accidents) be lost to the appellant  by  deportation.  That  point  has
    nothing to do with the statutory framework; but there are others  which
    do.

14. The judge's consideration of s. 117C comes at paragraph  54.  Here  the
    judge dealt quite adequately and realistically  with  s.  117C  (2)  in
    terms of the appellant's violent disorder conviction; but  it  is  only
    necessary to compare the sentences passed to see  that  this  was  very
    much the less important of the two: on  its  own,  it  would  not  have
    brought about automatic deportation at all. As for  the  drug  dealing,
    while the sentencing  judge  certainly  did  describe  the  appellant's
    offending as "right at the bottom of the category [3]  range  for  that
    offence", this needed to be seen in context.

15. Looking at the Sentencing Council's guidelines, to which the sentencing
    judge was referring, it should have been clear to  Judge  Higgins  that
    this was a very serious offence, not to be passed over simply  as  "...
    being in the bottom of the range of the relevant sentencing  category",
    compared to his more detailed treatment of the  relatively  unimportant
    violent disorder. This is not to criticize the judge for being concise,
    but for getting things out of proportion; in my view to the extent that
    he was wrong in law in the approach he took. Perhaps he was  misled  by
    the experienced sentencing judge's having dealt much more shortly  with
    the drugs offence, to which very specific guidelines applied, than with
    the violent disorder.

16. However, Judge Higgins's obvious mistake on s.  117C  was  in  his  not
    realizing that  sub-section  (3)  provided  that  the  public  interest
    required this appellant's deportation, unless either exception 1  or  2
    applied; but he did not consider either of them. So far as exception  1
    is concerned, he would no doubt have concluded, if  he  had  given  his
    mind to it at all, that it  could  not  possibly  be  argued  that  the
    appellant had been lawfully resident in this country for  most  of  his
    life, since he had been here, blamelessly or not,  without  leave  from
    1994 to 2008, and only with leave since then.

17. On exception 2,  the  judge  had  already  effectively  discounted  the
    appellant's relationship with his baby-mother (see his  paragraph  48);
    so there was no room for the 'unduly harsh' finding  required  for  the
    exception to apply. As for  the  appellant's  prospective  relationship
    with their child, he or she might well have been a  'qualifying  child'
    once born; but at the date of the first-tier hearing there  could  have
    been  no  question  of  the   appellant's   having   any   'subsisting'
    relationship with him or her.

18. It follows that, on the judge's findings of fact, neither  exception  1
    nor 2 applied: however, the parties agree that the terms of s. 117C (3)
    did not mean that the appellant's deportation must follow.  The  result
    is that the judge's decision is set aside; but  I  directed  a  further
    hearing on 27 November, for me to  re-make  it  on  the  basis  of  any
    submissions, and any relevant evidence, on any points still open to the
    appellant.

19. Re-hearing             On 27 November the appellant did appear, with  a
    number of family members. Mr Mackenzie  told  me  that,  sadly,  J  G's
    pregnancy had ended in a miscarriage, and the appellant's  relationship
    with her, perhaps not coincidentally, had also ended. It  follows  that
    neither J G nor the expected baby  enter  into  consideration  at  this
    stage. Mr Mackenzie suggested there should  be  a  full  re-hearing  on
    fresh oral evidence; but in the circumstances I saw no  need  for  one,
    and invited both him and Mr Clarke to address me on the evidence as  it
    stood. I did however admit the only piece of fresh documentary evidence
    Mr Mackenzie put forward, which  was  a  letter  from  the  appellant's
    probation officer, Mr David Watts,  dated  26  November.  Inevitably  I
    shall have to go again over some ground already covered.

20. Mr Watts says the appellant was released  on  immigration  bail  on  28
    August 2014, and was under his supervision till 30 July 2015, when  the
    licence period of his sentence expired.  Mr  Watts  says  he  "...  did
    generally comply with Licence Supervision, he had three absences during
    his licence period; however he  was  never  subject  to  formal  Breach
    Proceedings or Recall".  He  had  done  well  on  his  Thinking  Skills
    Programme [TSP] and other courses, but was said to have been unable  to
    get a job or  apply  for  formal  education  courses,  because  of  the
    requirements of his immigration bail. I am at a loss to understand  how
    this could have been,  since  the  appellant  has  benefited  from  the
    services of experienced specialized  solicitors  and  counsel.  If  the
    conditions first imposed proved too onerous, then an application  could
    have been made to vary them.

21. So far as the appellant's criminal propensities are concerned,  he  was
    assessed at the end of his licence period as posing a  medium  risk  of
    serious harm to members of the public and  known  adults  (specifically
    other gang members). However, Mr Watts says he  was  removed  from  the
    'gangs matrix' in July 2015, because there was nothing to show  he  was
    still involved in offending of that kind. The final assessment was that
    he presented a medium risk of non-violent reoffending, and a  low  risk
    of violent.

22. Findings of fact       The judge accepted much of  what  the  appellant
    had to stay, and there has no challenge to  that,  but  rather  to  the
    conclusions he drew from it. The relevant facts  for  present  purposes
    are that the appellant is now 22, and has lived in this country as  his
    home since 26 June 1994, when he was nearly eight months  old.  He  had
    leave to enter with her as a visitor, and presumably as  the  dependant
    of a student till 1995, but then no more till they both got  indefinite
    leave to remain in 2008.

23. The facts of the appellant's criminal record are already set out at  2:
    so far as the sentencing judge's assessment of  the  drugs  offence  is
    concerned, he described the appellant as "right at the  bottom  of  the
    category [3] range ...". What the judge meant, as would have been clear
    to all concerned, was that offering to  sell  0.34g  crack  cocaine  to
    someone who turned out to have been an undercover  police  officer  put
    him at the bottom of the street dealing category, with a  lesser  role,
    leaving him at the lowest end of a  range  going  from  3�  years  (the
    starting-point taken by  the  judge)  to  7.  That  starting-point  was
    reduced to 30 months on account of his late plea of guilty.

24. As for the violent disorder, the appellant had been involved in a  gang
    fight in a bookmaker's, to the extent that he took a crutch, which  had
    been brandished by his associate in the shop, out onto the street  with
    him: as the sentencing judge put it, he "... took  the  attack  to  the
    opposition, swinging that crutch in front of you". The violent disorder
    as a whole took 10 or 15 minutes, while the appellant's part in it  had
    lasted no more than 20 seconds. For this, no doubt bearing in mind  the
    totality of the sentence, the judge gave  him  3  months'  imprisonment
    consecutive to the drugs sentence, making 33 months in all.

25. The appellant's family  life,  as  things  stand,  is  limited  to  his
    relationship with his mother and siblings, and a number of his extended
    family members, all of whom came to the final hearing before me. He has
    only been back to Jamaica twice, for visits of

        a. (2009) 7 weeks, with his  mother  and  siblings,  following  the
           death of his maternal grandfather;

        b. (2011) 4 or 5 months with his maternal grandmother when she went
           back to live there herself.

26. The appellant's grandmother is now  partially  paralysed,  following  a
    stroke, and living in a  care  home,  which  was  arranged  before  the
    appellant returned to this country. So far as his mother is  concerned,
    she sent him money on his 2011 visit, but she  is  now  reading  for  a
    degree, and has her mother and two younger children to support; so  the
    judge accepted that she was not likely to  be  able  to  give  him  any
    serious practical help now.

27. Law      I have set out the relevant statute law and Rules at 4 - 5.  I
    see little point in discussing English case-law from before the present
    legislation. The possible exception is  Masih  [2012]  UKUT  (IAC)  46,
    which (see  the  judicial  head-note  at  (f)  -  (g))  reiterated  the
    principles in Maslov v. Austria -  1638/03  [2008]  ECHR  546.  However
    exception 1 to s.117C (taken with the rest of ss.  117B-C:  see  4)  is
    clearly framed to give effect to the principles in Maslov;  and  in  my
    view a conviction for offering to supply a class 'A' drug, even at  the
    lowest end of the street-dealing scale, is just as clearly  capable  of
    amounting to what the European  Court  of  Human  Rights  described  in
    Maslov (paragraph 85) as 'other [that  is,  non-violent]  very  serious
    offending'. I see no reason on the facts of this case for not regarding
    it in that light, though I shall give my detailed views on that later.

28. Dealing with the later authorities to which I was referred,  these  are
    the principles relevant to this case which need for present purposes to
    be  extracted  from  the  decisions,  which  are  for  the  moment   in
    chronological, rather than in any attempt  at  logical  order.  In  two
    cases, no more is required.

    AJ (Angola) [2014] EWCA Civ 1636

    (paragraph 39): "... a tribunal should seek  to  take  account  of  any
    Convention rights of an appellant through the lens  of  the  new  rules
    themselves,  rather  than  looking  to  apply  Convention  rights   for
    themselves in a free-standing way outside the new Rules".

    Chege (section 117D - Article 8 - approach :  Kenya)  [2015]  UKUT  165
    (IAC)

    (judicial head-note): in a case where neither paragraph 399 nor 399A of
    the Rules applies, "... are there very  compelling  circumstances  over
    and beyond those falling within [those paragraphs]  relied  upon,  such
    identification to be informed by the seriousness of the criminality and
    taking into account the factors set out in s.117B"

29. Next I come to Danso [2015] EWCA Civ 596 . Danso was a  young  man  who
    had come here in 1995 at 13, and got  indefinite  leave  to  remain  in
    2008; but the same year he was sentenced to 4� years' imprisonment  for
    attempted rape and other sexual  offences.  Similar  considerations  to
    those in the present case were put forward, including an assessment  by
    a consultant forensic psychologist to the effect that he presented less
    than a medium risk of further sexual offences, and a low one of violent
    re-offending.

30. This is what the Court of Appeal (Moore-Bick LJ, vice-president, giving
    what was effectively the judgment of the Court) had to say  about  that
    at paragraph 20: it is worth citing in full.


       [Counsel for the appellant] submitted that the tribunal  should  have
       placed much greater weight on the appellant's rehabilitation and  the
       fact that he did not pose a  significant  risk  of  re-offending.  He
       suggested that far too little importance is attached  to  factors  of
       that kind, with the result that those who commit offences have little
       incentive to co-operate with the  authorities  and  make  a  positive
       effort to change their ways. I have some sympathy with that  argument
       and I should not wish to diminish the importance  of  rehabilitation.
       It may be that in a few cases it will amount to an important  factor,
       but the fact is that there is nothing unusual about  the  appellant's
       case. Most sex offenders who are sentenced to  substantial  terms  of
       imprisonment are offered courses designed  to  help  them  avoid  re-
       offending in future and in  many  cases  the  risk  of  doing  so  is
       reduced. It must be borne in mind, however, that  the  protection  of
       the public from harm by way of future offending is only  one  of  the
       factors that  makes  it  conducive  to  the  public  good  to  deport
       criminals. Other factors  include  the  need  to  mark  the  public's
       revulsion at the offender's conduct and the need to deter others from
       acting in a similar way.  Fortunately,  rehabilitation  of  the  kind
       exhibited by the appellant in this case is not uncommon and cannot in
       my view contribute greatly to the existence of  the  very  compelling
       circumstances  required  to   outweigh   the   public   interest   in
       deportation.

31. Conclusions     Dealing with the case on  those  authorities,  it  will
    first be clear that, for the reasons given at 16 - 17, and on the basis
    of the facts as they now stand, this  appellant  cannot  succeed  under
    paragraph 399 or exception 2 to s. 117C, as he presently has neither  a
    child nor a qualifying partner in this country; nor can he do so  under
    paragraph 399A or exception 1 to s. 117C, as he has not  been  lawfully
    resident here for most of his  life.  That  means,  in  line  with  the
    authorities from MF (Nigeria) [2013]  EWCA  Civ  1192  to  AJ  (Angola)
    [2014] EWCA Civ 1636, that, to succeed on an article 8 claim, he has to
    show what are described  in  paragraph  398  as  "...  very  compelling
    circumstances over and above those  described  in  paragraphs  399  and
    399A".

32. Under Chege, consideration of what those might be will need  to  "...to
    be informed by the seriousness  of  the  criminality  and  taking  into
    account the factors set out in s.117B"; so I shall go  on  to  that.  I
    have dealt with the appellant's crimes, and what the  sentencing  judge
    had to say about them, at 23 - 24. I do not think that his placing  the
    appellant's supplying of crack cocaine in the lowest end of the  street
    dealing category can in any way be taken as meaning that it was not  to
    be regarded as a 'very  serious  offence',  in  terms  of  Maslov   and
    following decisions. This was a class 'A' drug, whose  only  too  well-
    known effects required, under the guidelines, a lowest sentence  of  3�
    years' imprisonment, subject to plea, even for  a  young  man  of  this
    appellant's age. As for the violent disorder,  though  the  appellant's
    own part in this gang fight did not take long, what happened must  have
    been seriously frightening for  any  members  of  the  public  present,
    either in the betting shop or out on the street.

33. So far as the appellant's  claimed  rehabilitation  is  concerned,  the
    supporting evidence is in Mr Watts's letter at 20  -  21.  Despite  the
    appellant's  three  recorded  absences  from  supervision  appointments
    during the course of his licence period, I am prepared to  accept  that
    there has been some degree of rehabilitation over that time. However, I
    note what the Court of Appeal said in Danso (see 29  -  30);  and  they
    clearly intended it to be generally applied,  at  least  in  cases  not
    involving EEA citizens or their family members.

34. While 'the public's revulsion' may not be so strong a factor with drugs
    offences as with sexual ones, the need  for  deterrence  of  others  is
    clearly as strong, and in my view even stronger. Where  an  offence  is
    committed for gain, as this appellant's was, since the sentencing judge
    said nothing about his being a user, deterrence must be very much  more
    of a practical goal than in the case  of  sex  offenders,  claiming  at
    least to be ruled by their private passions. I have to  conclude  that,
    in this case as in Danso, such evidence as there is of the  appellant's
    rehabilitation so far "... cannot in my view contribute greatly to  the
    existence of the very compelling circumstances required to outweigh the
    public interest in deportation".

35. Dealing with the factors set out in s. 117B (see 4), this appellant  of
    course speaks English like a native, which must be in  his  favour,  so
    far as it goes; he is not, and never has been financially  independent,
    which is  against  him,  though  his  imprisonment  no  doubt  has  had
    something to do with it. He does  not  have  any  qualifying  child  or
    partner. As for his private life, of course his relationship  with  his
    mother and other family members is not to be regarded as "suddenly  cut
    off when he reached his majority" (see HK (Turkey) [2010] EWCA Civ 583,
    paragraph 16).

36. However, the most significant, because earliest part of his  life  with
    them in this country was established between 31 October 1995, when  his
    mother's student leave expired, very shortly after his second birthday,
    and 23 July 2008, when she and he received indefinite leave to  remain,
    at a time when he was not quite 15. On reflection, I do not think there
    is anything in s. 117B (4) to justify regarding their  presence  during
    that period as in any way retrospectively legitimized by the subsequent
    grant of indefinite leave to remain, and it follows  that  his  private
    life with his family has to be given little weight. The Home Office had
    chosen to recognize, for the future, a state of affairs which had  been
    illegally brought about; but the effect of that recognition  could  not
    be expected to outlast the leave given having been made  precarious  by
    the appellant's own criminal conduct.

37. I should not in any case have  regarded  any  of  the  factors  so  far
    discussed as potentially amounting, on the facts as found, to the 'very
    compelling circumstances' required for this  appellant  to  escape  the
    consequence of his  crimes  being  deportation,  even  if  I  were  not
    constrained by legislation to treat them as of little weight. The  only
    factor which has given me pause for  concern  is  the  fact  that  this
    appellant would be leaving a country where he has been since he was not
    quite eight months old, for another where he has  no-one  now  able  to
    give him help or support, and has  only  visited  twice  (see  25)  for
    periods of no more than a few months.

38. However, it is quite clear from the authorities that  I  need  to  deal
    with this point, as with others, in terms  of  the  law  laid  down  by
    Parliament. It is a point clearly covered by the terms of  exception  1
    to s.117C: these are equally clearly set out  in  conjunctive  and  not
    disjunctive terms. It might well be open to  this  appellant  to  argue
    that there would be 'very serious obstacles to  his  integration'  into
    Jamaica, and there might possibly be  room  for  argument  that  he  is
    socially and culturally integrated into this country, despite the  term
    of imprisonment he has served for a very serious offence.  However,  in
    terms of the exception, neither of these points can help  him,  because
    he has unarguably not been lawfully resident here for most of his life.

39. The European Court of Human Rights's  summary  of  its  own  ruling  in
    Maslov  was this:

       75. In short, the Court considers that for a settled migrant who has
          lawfully spent all or the major part of his or her  childhood  and
          youth in the host country very serious  reasons  are  required  to
          justify expulsion. This is  all  the  more  so  where  the  person
          concerned committed the offences underlying the expulsion  measure
          as a juvenile.

40. I have already given my view that ss. 117B-C were clearly drafted  with
    Maslov  in mind, and so as to clarify its effect in an area  where  the
    need for clarity had become obvious.  For  an  offender  such  as  this
    appellant,  sentenced  to  a  term  of  between  one  and  four  years'
    imprisonment, s. 117C provides the exception set out at (4), and  I  do
    not think it is for me to seek to extend its scope by going beyond  its
    terms. This appellant had been convicted of a very serious offence; and
    the ruling in Maslov only applies, in  terms  of  the  requirement  for
    'very serious reasons', to those who have been lawfully resident in the
    country in question for most of their lives. In my view, even if  'very
    serious reasons' were required in this case in terms of  Maslov,  there
    were such reasons, after considering all the evidence, to justify  this
    appellant's deportation, by way of his class 'A' drugs conviction.

41. In terms of s. 117C (3), there are no 'very  compelling  circumstances'
    to make deportation unjustifiable in  this  appellant's  case.  He  had
    reached his majority, if only by  months,  by  the  time  he  committed
    either of his offences, and he is well beyond it now. Unfortunately for
    him, he will have to pay the penalty by way of deportation.
