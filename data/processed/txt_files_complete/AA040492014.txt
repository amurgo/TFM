 For the Appellant:    Ms B Asanovic, counsel instructed by AH Law Ltd
 For the Respondent:   Mr L Tarlow, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer



                         DECISION AND DIRECTIONS


  1. This is an appeal against a decision of FTTJ Del Fabbro, heard  on  18
     February 2015, in which he dismissed the appellant's appeal against  a
     decision to refuse to grant him asylum.



                          ï¿½ CROWN COPYRIGHT 2015




     Background


  2. The appellant as well his wife,  who  is  dependent  upon  his  claim,
     arrived in the United Kingdom on 24 February 2011, having been granted
     leave to enter as a Tier 4 migrant until 31 July 2014.  The  appellant
     unsuccessfully sought further leave to remain on 25 November  2013  on
     account of being destitute. He made a further application for leave to
     remain o 9 January 2014, which was refused the same  day.  He  applied
     for asylum on 2 June 2014.


  3. The basis of the appellant's asylum claim is that he  is  at  risk  in
     Nepal, primarily owing to his mixed-caste marriage. The appellant is a
     member of a low caste, Bishwokarma, one of the  Dalit  castes  whereas
     his wife is a member of the Brahmin caste. His wife's uncle, a  senior
     member of the Maoist party, was particularly unhappy with the marriage
     and orchestrated the violent pursuit of the appellant as a result.

  4. During the course of the hearing before the First-tier  Tribunal,  the
     appellant, his wife and a witness, Meena  Varma,  gave  evidence.  The
     FTTJ accepted that the appellant and his  wife  were  of  the  claimed
     castes but rejected the claim that  the  appellant  was  not  from  an
     impoverished Dalit background. It was not  accepted  that  the  Maoist
     Party would permit itself to be used to persecute the appellant by one
     of its members; that it  was  not  credible  that  the  uncle  of  the
     appellant's wife pursued him or that the appellant  was  assaulted  in
     2011. Alternatively, the FTTJ considered that there was a  sufficiency
     of protection for the appellant in Nepal or that he  could  internally
     relocate.


      Error of law


    5. Permission to appeal was sought on the basis  that  it  was  arguable
       that the FTTJ had no regard to the background  evidence  before  him;
       that  he  erred  in  preventing  questions  from  being  put  to  the
       appellant's witness and that an alternative case under Article 8 ECHR
       was not considered. The FTTJ granting permission considered that  the
       grounds showed an arguable error of law.

    6. The Secretary of State's response of 4  June  2015  stated  that  the
       respondent opposed the application for permission to appeal as it was
       considered that the FTTJ appropriately  directed  himself;  that  the
       grounds amounted to no more than mere disagreement with the  findings
       of  the  FTTJ;  the  FTTJ's  treatment  of  the  witness  was  wholly
       appropriate and if the witness had materially important  evidence  it
       should have been addressed in the witness statement.


 The hearing


  7.  Immediately  prior  to  the  hearing,   Ms   Asanovic   submitted   a
     supplementary note in which  she  sought  permission  to  rely  on  an
     additional ground of appeal, arguing that  the  FTTJ's  findings  were
     contradictory. She repeated  that  application  before  me  and  after
     hearing from Mr Tarlow, I permitted her to amend the original  grounds
     and extended the grant of permission to include this  further  matter.
     Ms Asanovic expanded on her written grounds, arguing that the FTTJ had
     made reference to the police report in [44] of the decision  in  order
     to support his findings that the Nepalese authorities were prepared to
     investigate the  appellant's  complaint,  but  that  at  [46]  he  had
     dismissed the  report  as  unreliable.  Similarly  at  [45]  the  FTTJ
     appeared to accept that it  was  the  prejudices  of  the  appellant's
     uncle's "which caused the animosity and violence towards them."


  8. Thereafter, Ms Asanovic relied on the original grounds of appeal and
     expanded somewhat on the application, which had been drafted by
     counsel, Mr Blundell, who appeared before the FTTJ.

  9. In relation to the first ground, Ms Asanovic took me to various parts
     of the background evidence, which was before the FTTJ. On the second
     ground, reference was made to the FTTJ's record of proceedings as well
     as Mr Blundell's note of the hearing. At this point, Ms Asanovic
     advised me that Mr Tarlow was taking no issue with Mr Blundell's
     witness statement, which accompanied the application for permission to
     appeal. With regard to the third ground, Ms Asanovic merely made the
     point that the FTTJ's decision made no reference to the alternative
     submissions in paragraph 19 and 20 of Mr Blundell's skeleton argument.

 10. For his part, Mr Tarlow, argued that there was material error in the
     FTTJ's decision. He was of the view that it was open for the FTTJ to
     find as fact that the appellant would be discriminated against but
     that this would not amount to persecution. In terms of the evidence of
     the witness Ms Varma, Mr Tarlow asked me note that the FTTJ heard some
     evidence from her but that it was a matter for him to decide whether
     he wanted her to be questioned further.

 11. The background evidence before the FTTJ included one bundle of 166
     pages of material, a second bundle with 76 pages and a supplementary
     bundle, which contained an additional 4 newspaper reports. Also
     present on the IAC case file was a draft expert report from David
     Seddon dated 7 July 2014.

 12. The decision of the FTTJ made several references to the background
     evidence relied upon by the appellant. At [13], he records that he has
     "considered all the voluminous evidence in the bundles before me," at
     [41] he says that he has "given careful consideration to all the
     evidence including a careful analysis and assessment of the objective
     evidence before me" and at [42] "I find on the objective evidence that
     membership of a Dalit caste does not in itself bring such
     discrimination as to breach minimum threshold standards."

 13. The difficulty with the FTTJ's approach was that he failed to engage
     with the background evidence or refer to a single page or extract from
     the background evidence before him. Mr Blundell's skeleton argument
     helpfully referred the FTTJ to particular extracts, which supported
     the appellant's case. The appellant relied upon a wide range of
     reports, which included but was not limited to references to Dalit
     people being subjected to violence to prevent participation in inter-
     caste marriages, the reluctance of the police to file a case against
     perpetrators of such violence, high resistance in the general
     population to inter-caste marriages and the imprisonment of Dalits who
     marry outside their caste owing to false cases being filed against
     them. While the FTTJ reached a finding that the appellant was not
     likely to be subject to discrimination amounting to persecution, he
     provided no reasons for this conclusion.

 14. The FTTJ also erred in his treatment of the evidence of Ms Varma.
     Counsel before the FTTJ, has provided a witness statement, which, with
     reference to his note of the hearing, states that the FTTJ prevented
     him from completing his examination-in-chief of Ms Varma. Mr Tarlow
     does not challenge that statement. Indeed, the FTTJ's record of
     proceedings goes some way to supporting Mr Blundell's evidence. It is
     apparent that after the FTTJ's intervention, examination-in-chief
     comes to a halt. As conceded by Ms Asanovic, Ms Varma's report lacked
     references, however as emerged from cross-examination, she had
     relevant qualifications and much of what she had to say was not
     inconsistent with the background evidence before the tribunal.
     Furthermore, while the FTTJ summarised Ms Varma's evidence at [32] of
     the decision, he does not proceed to assess her evidence either
     positively or negatively.


 15. The aforementioned matters suffice for me to find there were material
     errors of law and to set the decision aside. Furthermore, I would also
     agree with Ms Asanovic that the FTTJ's findings on the police report
     and whether or not the appellant was targeted by his wife's uncle were
     contradictory. In addition, the FTTJ failed to address, even briefly,
     the two alternative arguments made by Mr Blundell in [19] and [20] of
     his skeleton argument.



 16. In these circumstances I am satisfied that there  are  errors  of  law
     such that the decision be set aside to be remade. None of the findings
     of the FTTJ are to stand.

 17. Further directions are set out below.

 18. An anonymity direction  was  made  by  the  FTTJ  and  I  consider  it
     appropriate that this be continued and therefore  make  the  following
     anonymity direction:

        "Pursuant to Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
    Rules 2008 (SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order.  Unless  the  Upper
    Tribunal or a Court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings
    or any  form  of  publication  thereof  shall  directly  or  indirectly
    identify the original appellant. This  direction  applies  to,  amongst
    others, all parties. Any failure to comply with  this  direction  could
    give rise to contempt of court proceedings. "


Conclusions


     The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did involve  the
     making of an error on a point of law.

     I set aside the decision to be re-made.
