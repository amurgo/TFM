Representation:

For the Appellants:    No appearance by or on behalf of the appellants
For the Respondent:    Mr C Bates,  Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. The appellants are all nationals of India.  The first appellant is the
      partner of the second appellant.  The third appellant is their son,
      who was born on 22nd December 1993 and is now 27 years old.  Their
      appeal against the respondent's decision of 16th December 2019 to
      refuse their application for leave to remain in the UK on Article 8
      grounds, was determined on the papers and dismissed by First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Buckwell for reasons set out in a decision promulgated
      on 12th October 2020.


   2. The appellants claim that on 30th December 2019 they exercised their
      right to appeal the decision of the respondent.  They accept that when
      they filed the form IAFT-5 they stated that they wanted to have their
      appeal decided on the papers.  They claim that was a mistake, they
      changed their mind, and had decided they wanted an oral hearing. They
      claim they did not receive the respondent's bundle sent to them under
      cover of a letter dated 8th April 2020 and they had not received the
      directions issued by the Tribunal in March 2020 directing that they
      must send any written evidence and submissions to the Tribunal and the
      respondent, by 3rd April 2020.  They claim the Tribunal should have
      made sure that the documents were properly served and informed the
      parties of the directions to be complied with. They claim it was
      completely irrational for Judge Buckwell to determine the appeal
      solely upon the information set out in their application made in March
      2017.


   3. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Parkes
      on 25th November 2020.  He said:


         "2.  The grounds state that the appellant applied for a paper
         hearing of their appeals in error and then change their minds.
         There is no suggestion that the uplift fee was paid, or their
         change of mind communicated to the Tribunal. The grounds state that
         the third appellant is now living apart from the first and second
         appellants and that the appellants did not receive the respondent's
         bundle or the directions requiring them to serve their own bundle.


         3.   If the appellant did not receive the directions and
         respondent's bundle that could amount to an error of law, although
         I have been unable to locate it there is a recent case in which the
         evidence of service to the given address was sufficient to find
         service had been effective. However this is a matter that will need
         to be investigated. Both the Home Office and Tribunal will need to
         provide evidence of what directions were sent out and the address
         that they were sent to. If there is no evidence that an uplift fee
         was paid, the Appellants will not be able to complain that the
         decision was unfair."


    4. On 12th July 2021 a Notice of Hearing was sent to the parties,
       informing the parties that the appeal will be heard on Tuesday 17th
       August 2021. The notice sent to the parties makes it plain that; "If
       a party or his representative does not attend the hearing the
       Tribunal may determine the appeal in the absence of that party.".


    5. On 16th August 2021 (at 15:37hrs) an email was received by the
       Tribunal from Sanampreet Ghotra attaching a bundle comprising of 122
       pages.  The email was signed off with the name "MR Ghotra".  On 17th
       August 2021 (the morning of the hearing before me), a copy of the
       bundle comprising of 122 pages was also delivered to the Tribunal.
       On a copy of the Notice of Hearing, in manuscript, it is said; "Apps
       not coming as all ill".  The appellants bundle has been delivered to
       the Tribunal under cover of an undated letter that is signed by all
       three appellants. It is said to be a bundle that the appellants would
       have submitted to the First-tier Tribunal, had they "got the notice
       of hearings".  The covering letter states:


         "Payment


         We can confirm that we had only paid ï¿½80 earlier; however, I refer
         to my grounds of appeal at paragraph 6 which stated that


             "I intends (sic) to particularise each ground further at the
             hearing of the appeal and such other and further grounds may
             be argued at the hearing of this appeal."


         This ground of appeal in itself were an indication that my
         intention was to advance grounds of appeal at the appeal hearing
         which would be requiring an oral appeal hearing.


         I therefore, request that the error of law is found in the
         determination and the matter remitted back to the First Tier
         Tribunal for the consideration of our evidence as advanced in our
         witness statement, which has been submitted in our appeal bundle.
         In such appeal hearing, we would be attending the courts with some
         supporting witnesses and also require an interpreter.


         To save costs to us we would not be attending the courts on 17th
         August 2021 and request that the hearings are decided in our
         absence only."


    6. The hearing before me was called on at 2:30pm as listed, and there
       was no attendance by or on behalf of the appellants.  It is obvious
       that they have received Notice of the Hearing before me.  As I have
       said, on a copy of the Notice of Hearing, that was delivered to the
       Tribunal on the morning of the hearing in manuscript it is said;
       "Apps not coming as all ill".  No further information or explanation
       is provided.


    7. On behalf of the respondent, Mr Bates invites me to determine the
       appeal in the absence of the appellants.  He submits there is no
       application for an adjournment and no evidence before me that they
       are unable to attend the hearing. Mr Bates submits there is nothing
       in the respondent's papers that indicates that the appellants had
       requested an oral hearing before the First-tier Tribunal. There is no
       evidence of any additional fee being paid by the appellants. The
       directions issued by the Tribunal and sent to the parties on 5th
       March 2020 were received by the respondent and the respondent's
       bundle was sent to the appellants, at the address provided by the
       appellants to the respondent in December 2019.  He submits the
       respondent's bundle simply refers to the appellant's immigration
       history and has attached to it, a copy of the FLR(FP) applications
       made, the supporting evidence relied upon by the appellants and a
       copy of the respondent's decision. All the documents provided in the
       respondent's bundle are documents that emanate from the appellants
       and there is therefore nothing in the respondent's bundle that the
       appellants were unaware of, or that they did not have access to
       themselves. He submits it is beyond coincidence that correspondence
       sent to the appellants both by the respondent and the Tribunal,
       independently, but addressed to the same address, would not reach the
       appellants.  Mr Bates submits nothing further was heard from the
       appellants and it was open to Judge Buckwell to determine the appeal
       on the papers and dismiss the appeal for the reasons set out in his
       decision.


Discussion


    8. I am satisfied that it is in the interests of justice and in
       accordance with the overriding objective to proceed with the hearing
       listed before me, in the absence of the appellants.  The appellants
       are plainly aware of the hearing listed before me.  There is no
       application for an adjournment made by the appellants.  It is
       apparent from the undated covering letter to the bundle (addressed to
       the Birmingham Justice Centre) delivered to the Tribunal on 17th
       August 2021, and which was before me, that the appellants did not
       intend to attend the hearing before me and have requested that the
       hearing proceed in their absence.  I am satisfied the appellants have
       had an opportunity to participate, and that in proceeding in their
       absence, I can deal with the appeal fairly and justly in a way that
       is proportionate to the importance of the case, the complexity of the
       issues that arise, and the anticipated costs and resources of the
       parties.


    9. I have carefully considered the Tribunal file and note:


        a. On 30th December 2019, the Form IAFT-5 'Appeal against your Home
           Office decision' was received by the Arnhem Support Centre.  A
           separate form was completed by or on behalf of each appellant
           and the address at which the appellants can be contacted, is the
           same for each of them.  The appellants stated that they wish to
           have their appeal decided on the papers.


        b. On 14th December 2020, the Tribunal informed the appellants that
           there is a "requirement to pay a fee".  The Notice was sent to
           the appellants at the address provided by them and states in
           bold text:


             "You have not requested an oral hearing and you must now pay
             ï¿½80.00 in order for your appeal to proceed. This payment must
             be made to the tribunal no later than Tuesday, 3 March, 2020.
             Failure to pay the fee will result in the tribunal taking no
             further action on your appeal."


        c. The fee of ï¿½80 was paid by the appellants on 14th February 2020.


        d. Directions were sent to the parties by the Tribunal on 5th March
           2020.  The directions were posted to the appellants by second
           class post to the address provided by them.  The directions have
           not been returned to the Tribunal as "undelivered".


        e. The respondent's bundle was received by the Tribunal and the
           covering letter to that bundle is addressed to the first
           appellant and refers to the address provided by the appellants
           in the Form IAFT-5


   10. Judge Buckwell states at paragraph [3] of his decision:


         "By Notices dated 30 December 2019 each appellant exercised their
         right of appeal under section 82 of the Nationality, Immigration
         and Asylum Act 2002 ("the 2002 Act").  It is recorded that an
         appeal fee in the sum of ï¿½80 was paid by or on behalf of each
         appellant. That provided for each appeal to be determined only on
         the basis of the consideration of documentation and without the
         convening of any oral hearing. As these were combined applications
         they are combined appeals and it is appropriate for these three
         appeals to be determined together."


   11. The appellants accept that when they completed the Form IAFT-5, they
       stated that they wanted to have their appeal decided on the papers.
       They claim in the grounds of appeal that they had "opted for the
       paper hearing by mistake".  They claim they changed their mind and
       decided that they wanted an oral hearing.  They do not claim within
       the grounds of appeal, or in the covering letter to the bundle
       delivered to the Tribunal on 17th August 2021 that they had informed
       the Tribunal that they wish to have an oral hearing.  They accept
       that they only paid a fee of ï¿½80 in respect of the appeal.  The
       appellants claim in their letter it must have been apparent from the
       grounds of appeal that an oral hearing was required. It is said that
       at paragraph [6] of the grounds of appeal, they stated:


         "I intends (sic) to particularise each ground further at the
         hearing of the appeal and such other and further grounds may be
         argued at the hearing of this appeal."


   12. In my judgement the very vague and general claim made in paragraph
       [6] of the grounds of appeal was insufficient to require an oral
       hearing of the appeal in circumstances where the appellants had
       expressly invited the Tribunal to decide the appeal papers.  In any
       event, on 14th December 2019 the Tribunal informed the appellants
       that there is a "requirement to pay a fee".  The Notice was sent to
       the appellants at the address provided by them, and the notice makes
       it clear to the appellants that they have not requested an oral
       hearing and they must pay ï¿½80.00 in order for their appeal to
       proceed. There is no doubt that the appellants received that notice.
       They do not claim that they did not receive that notice or that
       having received the notice, they contacted the Tribunal and informed
       the Tribunal that they had mistakenly said in the form IAFT-5 that
       they would like the appeals to be determined on the papers, but in
       fact wish to have an oral hearing.  The appellants had been informed
       by the Tribunal that payment of the fee must be made to the Tribunal
       no later than 3rd March 2020.  The fee of ï¿½80 was paid by the
       appellants on 14th February 2020, as required.  The First-tier
       Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Fees Order 2011 provides
       that the fee for each person, where they consent to the appeal being
       determined without a hearing, is ï¿½80. Where they do not consent to
       the appeal being determined without a hearing, the fee is ï¿½140 per
       person.  As the appellants had neither informed the Tribunal that
       they wanted their appeals determined following an oral hearing, nor
       paid the required fee for an oral hearing, it was my judgement
       undoubtedly open to Judge Buckwell to determine the appeals on the
       papers.


   13. I then turn to the directions sent by the Tribunal to the parties on
       5th March 2020.  I am quite satisfied that the directions were sent
       to the appellants by second class post on 5th March 2020, to the
       address provided by the appellants as the address at which they can
       be contacted. The date upon which the directions were sent pre-dates
       any measures or announcement by the government of steps introduced to
       prevent the spread of Covid-19.  There is no indication in the
       Tribunal file or in the Tribunal's records that the directions were
       returned to the Tribunal as undelivered.  The directions were
       received by the respondent.  The Tribunal Procedure Rules 2014 make
       provision for any document to be provided to the Tribunal or any
       person under the rules, practice direction or a direction, to be sent
       by post to an address identified for that purpose by the Tribunal or
       person to whom the document is directed.  I am quite satisfied that
       the directions issued by the Tribunal on 5th March 2020 were sent to
       the appellants by post to the address identified by them, as required
       by the rules.


   14. The respondent's bundle was also sent to the appellants to the
       address provided by the appellants to the respondent, and to the
       Tribunal.  I accept, as Mr Bates submits, it is unlikely that the
       respondent's bundle was also not received by the appellants.  In any
       event, the respondent's bundle simply provides the appellants and the
       Tribunal with a copy of the FLR (FP) application made, copies of
       their passports, and the covering letter to their application.  The
       bundle comprises of copies of documents that the appellants are
       plainly aware of and will have been in the appellants possession for
       some time.  In fact they are documents that form part of the 122-page
       bundle now relied upon by the appellants.  The lack of a bundle from
       the respondent did not prevent the appellants providing the Tribunal
       with the evidence they relied upon in support of their appeal.


   15. There is in my judgment no error of law in the decision of First-tier
       Judge Buckwell, and it was in my judgement open to him to dismiss the
       appeals for the reasons set out his decision promulgated on 12th
       October.  The decision is not infected by any procedural unfairness.




   16. In any event, the appellants have provided what is described in the
       covering letter to the bundle delivered to the Tribunal on 17th
       August 2021, as the evidence that was not submitted to the Tribunal
       earlier, upon which they claim they would have relied.   In a joint
       witness statement signed by the first and second appellants dated
       16th August 2021, they accept, at paragraph [2], that they do not
       meet the requirements for leave to remain of the grounds family and
       private life as expressed in the immigration rules.  They refer to
       the length of their residence in the UK and the fact that they have
       been self sufficient in the UK without recourse to any public funds
       and have established considerable ties to the local community. There
       is nothing within the 122-page bundle that even begins to establish
       that the appellants' protected rights, whether considered
       individually or collectively are such as to outweigh the public
       interest in the appellants removal having regard to the policy of the
       respondent as expressed in the immigration rules.  The decision of
       Judge Buckwell made on the evidence before him was not only open to
       him: it was inevitable, even if the 122-page bundle now relied upon
       by the appellants had been before him.  It follows that in my
       judgment even if the appellants had provided the 122-page bundle to
       the First-tier Tribunal in accordance with the directions issued by
       the Tribunal, the evidence relied upon would not have impacted upon
       the outcome of the appeal.


   17. I am quite satisfied in all the circumstances that the decision of
       Judge Buckwell was open to him and the appellants have failed to
       establish that there is a material error of law in his decision
       capable of affecting the outcome. It follows that I dismiss the
       appeal.
