                            DECISION AND REASONS


Introduction


1. The appellant is a national of Uganda, born on 1 October 1975.

2. The respondent on 23 May 2014 decided to remove the appellant under
   section 10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, her claim based upon
   human rights having been refused.

3. Her appeal was heard by First-tier Judge Wyman on 4 February 2015. In a
   decision promulgated on 23 February 2015 the appeal was dismissed under
   the immigration rules and under article 8.

4. The appellant claimed she came to the United Kingdom on 16 August
   2002.She produced no evidence to confirm this. On 27 September 2012 she
   applied for leave to remain as a partner as well is on general human
   rights grounds. This application was refused on the 17 July 2013, with no
   appeal rights. She was then encountered at a registry office on 19 July
   2013. The marriage was allowed to proceed. The groom was a Mr Ebong , a
   British citizen. He has been living in the United Kingdom for 26 years,
   having arrived from Uganda as a refugee.

5. The appellant indicated she was bringing a judicial review of the
   respondent's earlier decision. The respondent reconsidered the
   application which was refused again on 20 May 2014 but with appeal
   rights. At that stage the appellant was pregnant and on 2 December 2014
   gave birth to a son.

The First tier

6. At the appeal the appellant's representative accepted that the
   requirements of paragraph 276ADE or appendix FM could not be met. The
   outstanding issue was a freestanding article 8 claim. Judge Wyman's
   decision refers to go Gulshan (Article 8- new rules- correct approach)
   Pakistan [2013] UKUT 640. The judge concluded there were compelling
   circumstances not sufficiently recognised by the rules to warrant a
   freestanding article 8 considerations. This is because the couple were
   married and had a baby.

7. The judge then proceeded to take a sequential approach as advocated in
   Razgar.It was accepted that family life existed between the appellant and
   her husband and their child. The judge also accepted a private life was
   established as the appellant had studied for a Masters degree and have
   made various friendships. The judge found the consequences of the
   respondent's decision were sufficiently grave as to engage article 8. The
   key issue was whether the decision was proportionate.

8. The judge commented that the appellant was 39 years old and had spent
   approximately 12 to 13 years in the United Kingdom. She had family living
   in Uganda. She had no health problems. Her husband earned in the region
   of ï¿½44,000 working for the Metropolitan Police. He was originally from
   Uganda and has visited in recent times. He has a teenage son from a
   previous relationship who he sees it weekend. The judge concluded there
   was no reason why he could not return to Uganda with the appellant whiles
   she reapplied for entry clearance or visit her while she was there. It
   was suggested he could possibly take a period of leave from work to be
   with her. The appellant could take her baby with her to Uganda. The
   conclusion was that it would not be disproportionate to expect the
   appellant to return to Uganda from where she could reapply for entry
   clearance. Consequently, her appeal was dismissed.

9. Permission to appeal was sought on the basis that the judge had not
   given adequate reasons. It was submitted that contact through modern
   communication means would be inadequate. The judge assumed that her
   husband would be able to take a leave of absence from work whilst she
   applied for entry. The decision of Chickwamba was cited as analogous.
   Reference was made to the effect upon on her husband of being separated.
   It was pointed out that the child was entitled to British nationality.

10. Permission was granted on the basis it was arguable the judge failed to
   give sufficient consideration to the best interests of the appellant's
   child and overlooked the decision of Hayat [2012]EWCA Civ 1054.It was
   arguably disproportionate to expect a person to make an application for
   entry clearance if this was the only factor in the balance.

The Upper Tribunal

11. At hearing the appellant's representative said the appellant's baby was
   only six months old and had not been inoculated for travel to Uganda. He
   highlighted the effect of a separation upon the appellant's husband. He
   believed it might take three months before entry clearance could be
   achieved. In response, the presenting officer argued that the situation
   was not one akin to Chickwamba. The appellant's husband had not produced
   any evidence to indicate he could not obtain leave from his work as a
   systems data analyst with the Metropolitan Police. Reference was also
   made to section 117 B.

Consideration

12. The appellant has a six-month-old child. It is well established that
   the best interests of children should be the primary consideration. The
   question whether the duties imposed by Section 55 have been duly
   performed in any given case will be a fact sensitive and contextual one.
   In considering their best interests the proportionality issue should not
   be a factor. Zoumbas v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013]
   UKSC 74  at paragraph 10 restates a child must not be blamed for matters,
   such as the conduct of a parent, for which it has no responsibility. It
   is well established that a child's best interests generally is to be with
   both parents. However, the best interest of the child is not necessarily
   determinative. The child is British. The presence of a British child in
   the factual matrix is not a trump card. In ZH (Tanzania) the
   countervailing considerations were the claimant's appalling immigration
   history and the precariousness of her position when family life was
   created.

13. The appeal has been presented on the basis any separation will be of a
   temporary nature. This is because an application for entry clearance,
   presumably under appendix FM, could be made. The appellant's
   representative has indicated a likely timescale of three months.

14. If the appellant has to go to Uganda there is the possibility she would
   take the baby with her. A six-month-old child will have little awareness
   of its surroundings. It has been suggested the child's father could take
   a leave of absence and spend time with his child in Uganda whilst an
   application is made for entry clearance.

15. The child's father has not presented any evidence about the possibility
   of a period of leave. In R (on the application of Chen) v Secretary of
   State for the Home Department) (Appendix FM - Chikwamba - temporary
   separation - proportionality) IJR [2015] UKUT 00189 (IAC) it was said it
   will be for the individual to place before the Secretary of State
   evidence that such temporary separation will interfere disproportionately
   with protected rights. Lord Brown was not laying down a legal test when
   he suggested in Chikwamba that requiring a claimant to make an
   application for entry clearance would only "comparatively rarely" be
   proportionate in a case involving children.It was indicated the
   appellant's husband is in well-paid employment with the Metropolitan
   police. Whilst I cannot make assumptions, in general a large public
   employer should be able to afford some flexibility towards its employees.

16.  The parents say the child has not been inoculated. However, I cannot
   see how this should present a difficulty.

17. It has been argued on behalf of the appellant it would be unreasonable
   in the circumstances to expect her to return to her home country in order
   to complete the formalities of seeking entry clearance. It was suggested
   the situation was akin to that in Chikwamba.In SSHD v Hayat (Pakistan);
   Treebhowan (Mauritius) v SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ 1054 the Court of Appeal
   held that if  to apply for entry clearance constitutes a disruption
   sufficient to engage Article 8 there will be a disproportionate
   interference unless there is a sensible reason for insisting on it.
   Whether there is a sensible reason will depend on the facts of the case,
   including such matters as the length and degree of disruption and the
   effect on other family members.  Where Article 8 is engaged and there is
   no sensible reason for the disruption, the Article 8 claim should be
   determined on its substantive merits.

18. I do not see the present situation is akin to Chikwamba.In that case
   requiring the appellant to return to Zimbabwe in order to apply for entry
   clearance was directed towards formal compliance. It was anticipated that
   entry clearance would be granted. Against that were inconvenience; cost;
   delay and disruption. Conditions at the time in Zimbabwe were described
   as harsh and unpalatable. The appellant's partner had been an asylum
   seeker from Zimbabwe and so there were difficulties with him joining her.
   In the present case these factors are not present and it is not being
   obtuse to expect the appellant to return and seek entry clearance. If an
   application is made under appendix FM she will need to demonstrate the
   requirements are met. If her husband is employed as stated then finance
   should not be a difficulty but nevertheless it must be demonstrated. The
   immigration judge found she had an appalling immigration history. The
   prospect of a return to Uganda was not the same as someone facing the
   harsh conditions in Zimbabwe. The appellant and her husband have only
   recently married and in the full knowledge of the likely difficulties
   over her immigration status. Their child as a baby. In the circumstances
   it is not disproportionate to expect the appellant to return and seek re-
   entry.

19. From 28 July 2014, Section 19 of the Immigration Act 2014 came into
   force.  It amends the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 by
   introducing a new Part 5A.This contains Sections 117A, 117B, 117C and
   117D which apply to all appeals where article 8(2) is considered directly
   from 28 July 2014, irrespective of when the application or immigration
   decision was made. Judge Wyman did not refer to this new provision
   dealing with the public interest. The judge did set out the factors taken
   into account in the proportionality exercise from paragraph 75 onwards.
   At paragraph 82 and 84 there is reference to how the child would be
   affected.

20. There is an obligation to take the statutory considerations into
   account .These state that little weight should be given to a private life
   or a relationship formed with a qualifying partner established as here
   when the person is in the United Kingdom unlawfully. The new provisions
   provide that the public interest does not require the person's removal
   where they have a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with a
   qualifying child as here. However, this is conditional upon it being
   unreasonable to expect the child to leave the United Kingdom.

21. In Dube (ss.117A-117D) [2015] UKUT 90 (IAC) it was held judges are duty-
   bound to have regard to the specified considerations. It is not an error
   of law to fail to refer to ss.117A-117D considerations if the judge has
   applied the test he or she was supposed to apply according to its terms;
   what matters is substance, not form. The appellant and her husband
   married in the full knowledge immigration officials were taking action
   because of her lack of status. The factual scenario does not suggest it
   would be unreasonable particularly as a temporary period is contemplated.
   Judge Whyman referred to the appellant at paragraph 77 as having a very
   poor immigration history and that she met her husband at the time when
   she knew she had no status. The judge referred to the possibility of the
   appellant taking her child with her to Uganda. Thus, although the
   statutory provisions are not specifically referred to I do not see any
   error of law here. In any event, the lack of specific reference is not
   material because the appeal was dismissed on proportionality grounds.

22. In conclusion, I do not find it established that there is a material
   error of law in the decision of Judge Wyman. There was no reference to
   section 117. However, it is substance which matters rather than form and
   section 117 only serves to support the dismissal of the appeal


Decision

No material error of law has been established in the decision of Judge
Wyman dismissing the appellant's appeal. Consequently, the appeal is
dismissed.
