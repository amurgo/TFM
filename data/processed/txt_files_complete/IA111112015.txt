Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. This is the appeal of Dharamvir  Singh,  a  citizen  of  India  born  15
   February 1978, against the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  of  4
   November 2015 dismissing his appeal against the  decision  of  14  March
   2015 to refuse his application for further leave to remain as an Tier  1
   Entrepreneur and to set removal directions against him under section  47
   of the Immigration Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.


2. The application giving rise to the  appeal  below  was  supported  by  a
   letter from Rochester's Chartered Accountants of February  2015  stating
   that the Appellant had invested �50,000 into the  business  in  exchange
   for ordinary shares of matching value. They invited further  enquiry  if
   necessary into the background of the investment.


3. The application was refused because the application  did  not  establish
   that the investment monies had been supplied in  the  Appellant's  name,
   and he was not named as a  shareholder;  and  because  the  accompanying
   accountant's letter was a copy rather than the original.


4. The First-tier Tribunal noted that by the time of the appeal hearing the
   asserted failings in the application had narrowed to two, ie the lack of
   any reference  to  the  shareholder's  investment  within  the  accounts
   provided, and the failure to provide "an accounts  compilation  report".
   The First-tier Tribunal concluded that whilst it would have been open to
   the Secretary of State  to  request  further  information  applying  the
   evidential flexibility rule 245AA to  rectify  the  missing  information
   within a specified document as to the first  flaw,  the  latter  failing
   represented a wholesale failure to provide a specified  document,  which
   was not a matter for which Rule 245AA catered.


5. Grounds of appeal contended that the First-tier Tribunal had  materially
   erred in law by assessing  the  application  under  the  wrong  part  of
   Appendix A, and alternatively had erred in its approach to the  asserted
   failings of the Secretary of State to properly exercise  her  discretion
   regarding missing documents and information within documents.


6. Although the First-tier Tribunal refused permission to appeal, the Upper
   Tribunal  subsequently  granted  it  on  28  June  2016,   Judge   Reeds
   considering it arguable that the appeal had been considered on the wrong
   basis, in that the claimed requirements as to specified  evidence  might
   not have applied under the sub-route by which the application  had  been
   made. Additionally, the Secretary of State may have failed  to  lawfully
   exercise her discretion under Rule 245AA or in  relation  to  the  wider
   discretion identified in SH Pakistan [2016] EWCA CIv 426, and the First-
   tier Tribunal might have erred in  law  in  its  approach  to  any  such
   failing.


7. Mr Layne made submissions consistent with  the  grounds  of  appeal.  Mr
   Wilding, whose crisp analysis of the  Rules  was  very  helpful,  argued
   that, properly  construed,  this  application  did  indeed  fall  to  be
   considered under paragraph 46-SD but was, for the reasons identified  by
   the Judge, doomed to fail thereunder.



Findings and reasons


8. Permission to appeal  has  been  granted  essentially  on  two  grounds.
   Firstly, on the basis that the  Appellant  should  have  benefited  from
   consideration of his application under paragraph  46-SD  of  Appendix  A
   rather than paragraph 41-SD thereof; secondly, because,  even  accepting
   that the correct  Immigration  Rules  were  applied,  that  the  primary
   decision maker acted unlawfully  by  failing  to  recognise  that  their
   discretion to invoke Rule 245AA  of  the  Immigration  Rules  addressing
   "Evidential Flexibility" was in  play,  and  that  this  rendered  their
   decision not in accordance with the law.


9. These are the relevant Immigration Rules in play under Appendix A  which
   glosses Part 6A to the Rules, addressing the Points Based System.


      "Attributes for Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrants
      35. An applicant applying for entry  clearance,  leave  to  remain  or
      indefinite leave to remain as a Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)  Migrant  must
      score 75 points for attributes.
      36. Subject to paragraph 37, available  points  for  applications  for
      entry clearance or leave to remain are shown in Table 4.
      37. Available points are shown in Table 5 for an applicant who:
      (a) has had entry clearance, leave to enter or leave to  remain  as  a
      Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant, a Businessperson or an Innovator in the
      12 months immediately before the date of application, or
      (b) is applying for leave to remain and  has,  or  was  last  granted,
      entry clearance, leave to enter  or  leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  1
      (Entrepreneur) Migrant, a Businessperson or an Innovator.
      45. If the applicant has invested the money referred to in Table 4  in
      the UK before the date of the application, points will be awarded  for
      funds available as if the applicant had not yet  invested  the  funds,
      providing:
      (a) the investment was made no more than 12 months (or  24  months  if
      the  applicant  was  last  granted  leave  as  a  Tier   1   (Graduate
      Entrepreneur) Migrant) before the date of the application; and
      (b) all of the specified documents required in paragraphs 46-SD (a) to
      (g) are provided to show:
      (i) the amount of money invested; and
      (ii) that the applicant has established a business in the UK, in which
      the money was invested.
      46-SD. The specified documents in paragraphs 45 and 46 are as follows:
      (a) The applicant must provide all the appropriate specified documents
      needed to establish the amount of  money  he  has  invested  from  the
      following list:
      ...
      (ii) If the applicant's business is not required  to  produce  audited
      accounts, unaudited accounts and an accounts compilation  report  must
      be provided from an accountant who is a  member  of  a  UK  Recognised
      Supervisory Body (as defined in the Companies Act 2006);
      (b) Audited or unaudited accounts must show the  investment  in  money
      made directly by the applicant, in his own name or on his behalf  (and
      showing his name). If he has invested by  way  of  share  capital  the
      business accounts must show the shareholders, the amount and value  of
      the shares (on the date of purchase) in the  applicant's  name  as  it
      appears on his application. If the  value  of  the  applicant's  share
      capital is not shown in the accounts, then share certificates must  be
      submitted as documentary evidence. The accounts must clearly show  the
      name of the accountant, the date the accounts were produced,  and  how
      much the applicant has invested in the business. The accounts must  be
      prepared and signed off in accordance with statutory requirements ..."


10. Table 4 then addresses Applications for  entry  clearance  or  leave  to
   remain referred to in paragraph 36 and affords 25 points where


      "(c) The applicant:
      (i) is applying for leave to remain,
      (ii)  has,  or  was  last  granted,  leave  as  a  Tier  1   (Graduate
      Entrepreneur) Migrant, and
      (iii) has access to not less than �50,000."


11. Part 6A of the Rules provides  for  some  degree  of  what  is  commonly
   styled "evidential flexibility" in how applications are processed.


      "245AA. Documents not submitted with applications
      (a) Where Part 6A or any appendices referred to in Part 6A state  that
      specified documents must be provided,  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer,
      Immigration Officer or the  Secretary  of  State  will  only  consider
      documents that have been submitted with the application, and will only
      consider documents submitted after  the  application  where  they  are
      submitted in accordance with subparagraph (b).
      (b) If the applicant has submitted specified documents in which:
      (i) Some of the  documents  in  a  sequence  have  been  omitted  (for
      example, if one bank statement from a series is missing);
      (ii) A document is in the wrong format (for example, if  a  letter  is
      not on letterhead paper as specified); or
      (iii) A document is a copy and not an original document; or
      (iv)A document does not contain all of the specified information;
      the Entry Clearance Officer, Immigration Officer or the  Secretary  of
      State may contact the applicant or his representative in writing,  and
      request  the  correct  documents.  The  requested  documents  must  be
      received at the address specified in the request within 7 working days
      of the date of the request.
      (c) Documents will not be requested where a specified document has not
      been  submitted  (for  example  an  English  language  certificate  is
      missing), or where the Entry Clearance Officer, Immigration Officer or
      the Secretary  of  State  does  not  anticipate  that  addressing  the
      omission or error referred to in subparagraph (b) will lead to a grant
      because the application will be refused for other reasons."


12. As numerous judges have remarked, the Rules comprising the Points  Based
   System  are  very  complex,  even  Byzantine.  Nevertheless,  the  Rules
   relevant to this appeal are clear once analysed.


13. A Graduate Entrepreneur may apply under Table 4 of Appendix  A  so  long
   as they have �50,000 of funds. Where they have made their investment pre-
   application, as  shown  by  para  45  of  Appendix  A,  they  must  then
   accumulate points in relation to that investment via  the  provision  of
   specified documents under para 46-SD of the Appendix, rather than  under
   the more commonly seen para 41-SD which provides the criteria by which a
   person's case is to be assessed if they have not  yet  made  all,  or  a
   material part of, their investment into the business.


14. However, para 46-SD still brings with  it  a  mandatory  requirement  to
   provide both "an accounts compilation report"  (para  46-SD(a)(ii))  and
   "accounts show[ing]  the  investment  in  money  made  directly  by  the
   applicant, in his own name or on his  behalf  (and  showing  his  name)"
   (para 46-SD(b)). So the fact that the original  decision  maker  or  the
   First-tier Tribunal may have had regard to the requirements of para  41-
   SD at any point does not change the fact that the relevant question  was
   posed by both of them; and in both respects  the  Appellant's  case  was
   found wanting.


15. So there is nothing in the "route" point. The  question  remains  as  to
   whether Rule 245AA should have been invoked on his behalf.


16. As to the asserted flaw with the failure of the  accounts  to  name  the
   Appellant as an investor, that was plainly amenable to rectification  at
   the decision maker's initiative  by  invoking  Rule  245AA(b)(iv)  which
   addresses the situation where "A document does not contain  all  of  the
   specified information". However, that  discretion  is  only  exercisable
   where the "Secretary of State does not anticipate  that  addressing  the
   omission ... will lead to  a  grant  because  the  application  will  be
   refused for other  reasons".  So  it  was  only  necessary  to  consider
   exercising that discretion if there was no independent fatal flaw in the
   application.


17. Unfortunately, there was such a flaw.  The  Rule  makes  it  clear  that
   "Documents will not be requested where a specified document has not been
   submitted". The "accounts compilation report" is just such  a  document.
   None was submitted. Accordingly  there  was  no  duty  on  the  original
   decision maker to  call  for  further  information  regarding  specified
   documents that had been submitted but were found themselves deficient in
   content.


18. Although the point was not pursued in oral  argument  before  me,  there
   remains the residual discretion upon which the Court of Appeal  alighted
   in SH (Pakistan) which might have availed  the  Appellant  even  if  the
   Immigration Rules did not. However, as Elias  LJ  [2016]  EWCA  Civ  426
   quoted at [19] from the broader guidance outside the  Rules:  "You  must
   refuse the application if the application falls for refusal even if  the
   missing information was provided, or minor error was corrected." So  the
   fact that there was an independent fatal flaw beyond  the  matter  which
   might have been  rectified  by  the  provision  of  further  information
   defeats any submission on this ground.


19. Accordingly it is apparent that the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal
   did not contain a material error of law.


   Decision:


   The appeal is dismissed.
