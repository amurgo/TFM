Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr A Shoroye of Counsel, instructed by Graceland
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr C Howells, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born on 9th  January  2007.   She
    sought to apply under the Immigration Rules for entry clearance so that
    she may join her father in the United  Kingdom.   The  application  was
    refused on 9th December 2015.

2.   The appellant sought to appeal  against  that  decision,  which  appeal
    came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Suffield-Thompson on  7th  August
    2017.  In a subsequent determination promulgated on  16th  August  2017
    the appeal was dismissed.

3.   Thereafter the appellant sought to challenge that  decision  and  leave
    to do so was granted to the Upper  Tribunal.   Thus,  the  matter  came
    before me on 17th August 2018 and it was my finding that the  principle
    of TD (Paragraph 297(i)(e) "sole responsibility") Yemen [2006] UKAIT 49
    had not been properly applied.  Consequently, I set aside the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal to be remade in the Upper Tribunal.  I  gave
    directions for the evidence to be obtained and indicated that the focus
    of consideration would be on TD in particular.

4.   At the subsequent hearing, a  supplementary  bundle  of  documents  was
    presented, making some attempt to meet the evidential  issues  which  I
    have raised, although perhaps not entirely meeting them.

5.   [VE], the sponsor, adopted his witness statement  of  7th  August  2018
    and gave evidence at the hearing.  The appellant was conceived  in  the
    course of the relationship between the sponsor and [CA].  They were too
    young to care for her and so the decision was made that she would  live
    with the sponsor's parents.

6.   The sponsor came to the United Kingdom, since  when  he  has  become  a
    British citizen.  He is  married  with  two  children  and  earns  some
    ï¿½42,000 a year  as  a  mental  health  care  assistant.   He  has  been
    undertaking this task for some seven years.

7.   As a father he has provided the emotional support,  affection  and  the
    interest in the appellant's welfare and wellbeing.  He has provided the
    funding for his parents 's home and for the appellant's education.   He
    keeps in very regular contact with the appellant and  his  parents,  as
    demonstrated by the many telephone calls through Lycamobile  that  have
    been exhibited in these proceedings.  The documents have been presented
    in the first appeal bundle, which include phone records,  phone  cards,
    wage slips of the sponsor, money transfer receipts.

8.   The sponsor came to the United Kingdom in 2011 and  before  that  lived
    with his parents in Nigeria and therefore saw the appellant every  day.
    Since he has come to the United Kingdom  there  have  been  visits  and
    everyday phone contact.  In particular copies of the sponsor's passport
    showing visits on 12th September 2015 to 6th October 2015, 2nd February
    2016 to 3rd March 2016, 10th October 2016 to 19th October 2016 and 16th
    January 2018 to 6th  February  2018.   In  addition,  the  sponsor  has
    visited for three days in June 2018 and  for  five  days  in  September
    2018.

9.   The appellant lives with her grandparents in a two bedroomed  house  in
    Ilorin which is a small town.  She goes to the local school.   She  has
    just finished primary school and is  starting  secondary  school.   The
    decision as to which school to go to  was  made  as  being  the  school
    nearest where she lives because of  transport  problems.   The  sponsor
    chose the school and pays the fees of the school  and  receives  school
    reports as to her progress.  The appellant attends  a  Catholic  Church
    and loves playing football.  However, with the grandparents  not  being
    able to drive, such does restrict where she can go.   Speaking  to  the
    appellant she wants more of a social life and feels very restricted  at
    home.

10.  Part of the problem is that the grandparents are  getting  elderly  and
    are in bad health.  Indeed, the grandfather is almost blind. Indeed  he
    slipped and fell injuring his back in June, which ended with him  being
    taken into the hospital for a week.  It was that accident that prompted
    the visit in June 2018.  The sponsor's  mother  needed  help  and  also
    needed money to pay for  medical  attention.   The  grandmother  has  a
    number of ailments and cannot walk for long  distances.   Although  his
    father is back at home  the  sponsor  indicated  that  he  was  largely
    bedridden because of what had happened to him.

11.  The appellant fainted and collapsed in September 2018  and  had  to  be
    taken to hospital.   That  incident  is  what  prompted  the  visit  in
    September and again the sponsor paid the medical fees. She was put on a
    medical drip and a diagnosis of acute asthma was made.

12.  Various documents were presented  further  to  those  at  the  original
    hearing, being letters relating to the  junior  and  secondary  school.
    Also, affidavits from the grandparents as to the nature of their health
    and various up-to-date payslips and telephone records.

13.    The evidence  of  the  sponsor  is  that  the  appellant  is  feeling
    increasingly isolated  and  in  effect  had  become  a  carer  for  her
    grandparents, it was affecting  her  ability  to  interact  with  other
    people of her own age.

14.  In terms of other support  available  to  the  appellant  there  is  an
    affidavit from her natural mother sworn before the magistrate in  Lagos
    of 4th October 2018. The mother had kept in contact with the appellant.
     She however is in a new relationship and lives in Lagos which  is  far
    away from Ilorin.  She does not have the capacity to take care  of  the
    appellant and indeed, because she was born out of wedlock, her  husband
    has refused to accept her daughter into his home since he believes that
    her presence would threaten the marriage.  She has  given  consent  for
    the daughter to be allowed to come to the United Kingdom.

15.  There would also seem to  be  in  the  area  an  elder  sister  of  the
    appellant.  She has a family and three children of her  own  and  lives
    some nine hours away from Ilorin and would not be  able  to  assist  in
    taking in the appellant.

16.  It is the case for the sponsor that, throughout his time in the  United
    Kingdom and to the present time, that he takes all the major  decisions
    affecting the appellant.  He  pays  all  the  bills  including  medical
    bills.  He was in contact with the  appellant's  mother  and  she  also
    visited from time to time.  In terms of direction as to school  choices
    and life events it was the sponsor who made those decisions.  There  is
    some discussion with the appellant and with his parents.

17.   There  is  some  medical  evidence  relating  to  the  health  of  the
    grandparents, particularly a letter from Ilorin  Teaching  Hospital  in
    February 2016 as to the grandmother.  She is stated as being a 67  year
    old with degenerative disease of  both  lumber  spine  and  knees  with
    obesity.   This has  caused  handicap  limitations  to  her  condition.
    Similarly there is a letter from the first eye  clinic  concerning  the
    grandfather being then described as 74 years old with chronic  glaucoma
    with a visual disability of 95%.   There  were  no  up-to-date  medical
    reports although there was an affidavit from the grandparents  speaking
    as to their age and illness.

18.  Having heard the sponsor and  indeed  having  looked  at  a  number  of
    documents as relied upon, I find that he is a credible  witness  as  to
    the circumstances which he seeks to describe.

19.  The case of TD to which reference has  been  made,  it  indicates  that
    "sole responsibility" is a factual matter to be decided  upon  all  the
    evidence.  This is whether the appellant  has  continuing  control  and
    direction  over  the  child's  upbringing,  including  making  all  the
    important decisions in the child's life.  However, where  both  parents
    are involved in a child's upbringing, it would be exceptional that  one
    of them will have "sole responsibility".   As  the  sponsor  indicated,
    although the appellant's natural mother has contact, the responsibility
    for what is done for the appellant falls upon his shoulders.

20.  The relevant matters are set out in  Rule  297,  essentially  those  in
    297(1)(e) whether or not the sponsor has sole  responsibility  for  the
    child's upbringing or:

         '(f)  there  are   serious   and   compelling   family   or   other
             considerations  which  make  the  exclusion   of   the   child
             undesirable and suitable arrangements have been made  for  the
             child's care.'

21.  It is not in issue otherwise than  that  the  sponsor  would  meet  the
    entry requirements.  He is a British citizen,  there  is  accommodation
    available to the appellant and he is earning well above the minimum  to
    meet the financial requirements.

22.  It seems to me that the matter can be  resolved  on  both  ingredients.
    The burden of proof is upon the appellant to show  on  the  balance  of
    probabilities that she meets the requirements of the Immigration Rules.
     I find that the sponsor, her father has had  sole  responsibility  for
    her upbringing.

23.  Further I am mindful of  the  comments  made  in  the  decision  of  MM
    (Lebanon) [2017] UKSC 10 that there is a deficiency in the  Immigration
    Rules, in that there is a failure  to  take  into  account  Section  55
    namely the wellbeing or the best interests of the child.   Although  no
    doubt the appellant enjoys the love and support of her grandparents she
    is feeling increasingly isolated and restricted in what she can do.  In
    the United Kingdom she has a family and two half-siblings with whom she
    can  grow  up  in  a  more  natural  and  open  environment.   As   the
    grandparents become  increasingly  infirm  and  housebound,  such  will
    create a very lonely environment for the appellant and I consider  that
    there are serious and compelling family or other  considerations  which
    make the exclusion of the appellant undesirable and that have  suitable
    arrangements have been made for her care.

24.  This is an appeal by way of Article 8 of the ECHR.   I  find  that  the
    appellant now meets the Immigration Rules relating to entry  clearance.
    I bear in mind that her best interests are to be with  her  father  and
    extended family in the United Kingdom.  I find in particular  that  her
    development will  be  greatly  assisted  in  that  process.   There  is
    adequate accommodation and family support and there is very little that
    can be put in the balance against the grant of entry clearance in  this
    particular case.  No criticism in immigration terms has  been  made  of
    the sponsor nor of the appellant.  There seems to be very little ground
    for the contention that it would be in the public interest to  maintain
    exclusion of her in all the circumstances.  I find therefore  that  the
    public interest and indeed proportionality should be  resolved  in  her
    favour such that entry clearance be granted. I find that to continue to
    deny her entry clearance would constitute a breach of  her  fundamental
    human  rights  as  under  Article   8,   notwithstanding   the   proper
    consideration  which  should  be  given  to  the  public  interest   in
    maintaining sound and fair immigration control.

Notice of Decision

25.  In the circumstances the appellant's appeal is allowed on the basis  of
    Article 8 of the ECHR.

26.  No anonymity direction is made.
