                            DECISION AND REASONS
Anonymity order

Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
(SI 2008/269) The Tribunal has ORDERED that no one shall publish  or  reveal
the name or address of T N who  is  the  subject  of  these  proceedings  or
publish or reveal any information which would  be  likely  to  lead  to  the
identification of him or of any member of  his  family  in  connection  with
these proceedings.

Any failure to comply with this direction could give  rise  to  contempt  of
court proceedings.


The appellant appeals with permission against the decision of First-tier
Judge Cowx on 1 October 2019, dismissing her appeal against the
respondent's decision to refuse her refugee status under the 1951
Convention, humanitarian protection, or leave to remain in the United
Kingdom on human rights grounds.  The appellant is a citizen of Vietnam and
a former victim of trafficking who benefits from a Conclusive Grounds
decision in her favour.

On 19 June 2020 Upper Tribunal Judge Owens set aside the decision of the
First-tier Tribunal for remaking in the Upper Tribunal and that is the
basis on which that appeal comes before me today following a transfer order
made on 23 November 2020 by Upper Tribunal Judge Kopieczek.

The facts are fairly straightforward.  The appellant was born in Vietnam on
1 October 1999 and is now 21 years old.  Her mother borrowed large amounts
from loan sharks in Vietnam to pay for gambling debts and eventually owed
over ï¿½100,000.  In December 2017 when the appellant was just 18 years old
loan sharks came to the family home demanding money with threats.  They
came back a week later and the appellant and her mother signed a document
requiring the appellant to work for the loan sharks in Russia for six years
to clear off the debt.  On 20 December 2017 the appellant's mother
committed suicide.  She has no family support in Vietnam at all in
consequence.

In early January 2018 the loan sharks collected their debt and the
appellant was trafficked to Russia where she was held in a warehouse and
repeatedly raped by multiple men until August 2018 when she was trafficked
on to the United Kingdom to work on a cannabis farm.  On 6 September 2018
the appellant escaped and went to Glasgow where she went to the police and
reported her circumstances.  Understandably she fears re-trafficking by the
loan sharks.

The respondent, as the Competent Authority, has accepted to the higher
standard of balance of probabilities that the appellant's account is true
and she was trafficked as she says.  There is therefore no doubt at all
that the appellant has established, to the lower standard applicable in
international protection claims, that she is a victim of trafficking and is
at risk in her home area.

That means that she is a person who comes within Rule 339K of the
Immigration Rules, which is as follows:

"The fact that a person has already been subject to persecution or serious
harm or to direct threats of such persecution or such harm will be regarded
as a serious indication of the person's well-founded fear of persecution or
real risk of suffering serious harm unless there are good reasons to
consider that such persecution or serious harm will not be repeated."

The respondent accepts that in the appellant's home area there are no such
good reasons.

The respondent relies on internal relocation within Vietnam.  I have been
taken to the respondent's CPIN, in particular sections 6, 7 and 11 thereof.
 At section 6 there is evidence of the efforts which are being made by the
Vietnamese authorities to combat trafficking.  However, those efforts are
not necessarily fully successful yet and in particular victim certificates
are not generally available to those who left Vietnam "willingly".

At 6.4.6 the 2019 Australian DFAT Report noted some difficulties with the
judiciary and that bribes and irregular payments to facilitate favourable
judicial decisions were perceived to be common with around a quarter of
Vietnamese citizens believing that most or all judges were corrupt.

The U.S. State Department in 2019 is reported as continuing to have
concerns about enforcement and there is citation from an article by Hagar
and a conversation between Hagar and the Fact-Finding Mission in February
2019 about the difficulties of reporting incidents to the authorities.
There are some shelters available and some NGO support.  At section 8 the
report deals with the risk of re-trafficking.  At 8.1.2 it says this:

"The 2019 report Precarious Journeys noted,

             'if victims have spoken to the police and/or still owe a debt
             to their traffickers they are likely to be at risk of re-
             trafficking or reprisals from their traffickers and/or the
             Vietnamese authorities.  There is limited support available in
             Vietnam for returned victims, leaving them at risk of being re-
             trafficked or even becoming a trafficker themselves.' ...

8.1.4    Several sources refer to Mimi Vu, an anti-trafficking advocate
based in Vietnam, who has stated that outstanding debt and other factors
which led to victims being trafficked initially still remain when victims
are returned to Vietnam.  As those factors still exist victims remain at
risk of being re-trafficked."

Paragraph 9 deals with the social stigma of trafficking victims in Vietnam,
which is still a communist country.  Victims often do not want to be
identified due to social stigma.  The 2019 DFAT Report is quoted again at
9.1.4:

"Returnees, including [...] trafficking victims, typically face a range of
difficulties upon return.  These include unemployment or underemployment
and challenges accessing social services, particularly in cases where
household registration has ceased.  In addition, trafficking victims face
social stigma and discrimination and may experience difficulty in accessing
appropriate trauma counselling services outside of large cities.  Many
returnees have high levels of debt from funding their travel out of
Vietnam.  Sources in Vietnam have reported cases of moneylenders taking
borrowers' houses or land as repayment or borrowers having to flee loan
sharks when they are unable to repay their loan."

There is a separate CPIN on Vietnam, Fear of Illegal Moneylenders, to which
my attention has not been drawn during these proceedings.  Paragraph 10
sets out the position of women in general and paragraph 11 deals with
freedom of movement.  At paragraph 11.2 the respondent relies somewhat
optimistically on the continuing promise to scrap the Ho Khau and manage
Vietnamese citizens through identification numbers on a new online national
database.

 Mrs Aboni was not able to say to me today that as at 3 December 2020 that
database, due to be introduced in 2020, is a reality.  Hagar and an
academic source are recorded as having told the Fact-Finding Mission
(11.2.2) that Ho Khau registration is not a barrier to moving around the
country and does not prevent free movement but the DFAT Report quoted at
11.2.3 is less optimistic, setting out difficulties in accessing healthcare
facilities and other Social Services and states that:

"Household registration requires citizens to register their permanent
residence in only one district in Vietnam.  To gain permanent residence
status in a new district, citizens must either marry into a family already
holding permanent residence, purchase land or live in rental housing with
an official lease and a minimum amount of liveable space."

It is not certain that the appellant would have to return to her home area
where it is agreed that she is at risk but what is clear is that she may
have some difficulty in re-registering in an area of internal relocation.
She is a lone woman who has been trafficked and suffered significant abuse
who has mental health problems in consequence.

I have also been taken to the report of Dr Tran which deals at part 2 with
the insufficiency of the government efforts to combat trafficking and
protect victims.  It is not necessary to quote at length from that report.
For all of the above reasons and for this particular appellant I cannot be
satisfied even to the lower standard applicable in international protection
proceedings that this victim of trafficking will be able to successfully
internally relocate to another part of Vietnam and rebuild her life there,
given that she has no family support and she has mental health problems.
The appellant's appeal is allowed.

Conclusions

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I set aside the decision.

I re-make the decision in the appeal by allowing the appeal.
