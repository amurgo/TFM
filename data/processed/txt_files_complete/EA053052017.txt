Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms Delbourgo, Counsel instructed on behalf of the
Appellant.
For the Respondent:    Ms Isherwood, Senior Presenting Officer.

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant appeals against the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Ford who in  a  determination  promulgated  on  1st  August  2018
    dismissed her appeal  under  the  Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations  2016
    against the Respondent's decision dated  22nd  May  2017  refusing  her
    application for a residence card.  Permission was granted by the First-
    tier Tribunal, Judge Simpson on 24th September 2018.

 2. In a decision promulgated on the 31st December 2018, I gave reasons why
    the decision of FtTJ Ford demonstrated the making of an  error  of  law
    and the decision was set aside to be  re-made  by  the  Upper  Tribunal
    rather than by way of remittal to the First-tier Tribunal. As the issue
    related to the issue of the appellant  having  to  establish  the  work
    history of her former partner, directions were made for the  respondent
    to make enquiries of the HMRC and the DWP records in the name of her ex-
    husband; that is  normally  described  as  an  Amos  Direction.   Those
    enquiries were not without their difficulties but were produced in  two
    documents, one from HRMC and one from the  DWP  setting  out  what  was
    known from the records that they held.

The re-making of the decision:

 3. For the  purposes  of  the  proceedings  before  me  the  Appellant  is
    represented by Counsel Ms Delbourgo and the Senior  Presenting  Officer
    is now Ms Isherwood. The FtTJ made anonymity direction which  had  been
    continued in the interim but no grounds have been advanced  as  to  why
    any  such  direction  should  still  continue  to  be  made  in   these
    proceedings  (see  Smith  (appealable  decisions:   PTA   requirements;
    anonymity) [2019] UKUT 216).

 4. I have heard the oral evidence of the appellant and have  a  number  of
    documents served  on  behalf  of  the  appellant  ,  including  witness
    statements, none of which have been put in a consolidated bundle and it
    has been necessary at points in the hearing to have documents copied to
    ensure all present had the  same  papers.  I  am  satisfied  that  both
    advocates have had sight of all the documents relied upon by each party
    and I have taken into account all of the documentation before me.

 5. I have also been provided with skeleton arguments from  each  advocate.
    It is not necessary to set out those submissions and I confirm  that  I
    have taken them into account when reaching my decision.   I  intend  to
    consider those submissions in my analysis of  the  issues  relevant  to
    this appeal.

The factual background:

 6. The  history  and  background  to  the  marriage  has  not  been  clear
    throughout these proceedings and the witness statements  provided  have
    been lacking in detail. At times during the  hearings  that  have  been
    before the Upper Tribunal I have had to enquire  of  the  appellant  to
    provide necessary information, for example, as to the date the  parties
    separated which had not been referred to in the  documents  or  witness
    statements. It has therefore not been an easy  task  to  ascertain  the
    factual background. What I set out below is as a  result  of  the  oral
    evidence given by the appellant during the hearing.

 7. It is not said when the appellant's ex-spouse entered the UK or in what
    circumstances. The Appellant married on  the  19th  August  2011.   The
    parties lived together until they separated. When  asked  to  give  the
    date of their separation at a previous hearing before  me,  she  stated
    that it was December 2014. However, when questioned about the date  and
    against that background that she gave birth to the child of her present
    partner she stated it was sometime in 2014.

 8. As to her ex-spouses' employment history, the appellant had stated that
    she believed that her former husband had been  working  for  the  whole
    duration of the time that she had been in the UK. She set out that  she
    was unable to provide any documents regarding his work as he had always
    been secretive (see paragraphs 7-8; w/s 27/3/18). In cross  examination
    she said that he had been manipulative and  less  than  straightforward
    and that she had  worked  in  the  marriage.  She  said  that  she  had
    supported him when he was working and that he did not discuss his  work
    with her. In her oral evidence she was asked why she had said that  her
    ex-spouse had been self-employed when the checks revealed that  he  had
    not returned any forms for self- employment. She stated  that  she  had
    this heard through friends but did not know what he was doing. She said
    that he was not self-employed to begin with. When asked about the basis
    of his claim for ESA or DLA she stated that he had been in hospital and
    that he had a problem with his knee

 9. On the 18 November 2016 a divorce petition  was  issued  based  on  her
    husband's unreasonable behaviour.  The  evidence  before  the  Tribunal
    demonstrates that the divorce petition was not served  and  there  were
    difficulties with serving such a petition to  the  extent  that  deemed
    service was then ordered on 3rd October 2017 by the County Court.   For
    these proceedings the issue of the divorce petition  on  18th  November
    2016  according  to  a  recent  statement  of  the  Appellant   is   of
    significance given the decision of the Court of Appeal in  Baigazive  v
    Secretary of State Reported [2018] EWCA Civ 1088.

10. The application was then made by the Appellant  for  a  residence  card
    relying on her retained rights following divorce.  That  was  based  on
    being a former family member of an  EEA  national  who  was  exercising
    treaty rights at  the  time  of  the  divorce.  She  also  applied  for
    permanent residence.

11. In the application form that she provided, she set out details that she
    knew of his employment with Amazon from July 2011  to  March  2012  and
    from March 2012 to February 2013 with Santander.  After that she  wrote
    in her application form that there was  self-employment  undertaken  by
    her ex-husband but the dates of that  or  the  sources  of  that  self-
    employment were not known to her.

12. It is as a result of that that a direction was made for the  Respondent
    to make enquiries of the HMRC records in the name  of  her  ex-husband;
    that is normally described as an Amos Direction.  These have  now  been
    completed and now form the factual background to the re-making  of  the
    decision.

13. The decisions on applications made are set out in the papers before  me
    and in a decision that was made under Regulation 10(5)  and  Regulation
    15(1)(f).  The decision was made on the 22nd May 2017 and supported  by
    the decision letter.

14. The decision letter stated that in order  to  qualify  for  a  retained
    right of residence following divorce it was necessary for the applicant
    to provide  evidence  that  she  was  currently  in  employment,  self-
    employment or economically  self-sufficient  as  if  she  were  an  EEA
    national.

15. It is plain from reading the decision letter that that was accepted  by
    the Secretary of State given that the Appellant had  provided  evidence
    of her employment from two sources and also P60s from 2014 to 2016.  It
    was also required that she provided evidence that her  relationship  or
    her marriage lasted for at least three  years  and  that  she  and  her
    former spouse resided in the United  Kingdom  for  at  least  one  year
    during the marriage.  Again it is plain from the  refusal  letter  that
    that was also accepted given that the  marriage  had  lasted  at  least
    three years, the date  of  the  marriage  being  2011.   What  was  not
    accepted was that the evidence of the EEA former spouse was  exercising
    free movement rights in the United Kingdom at the time of  the  divorce
    and that she had not provided evidence of that.

16. In addition as the application was  one  for  permanent  residence  she
    would have to demonstrate that  she  resided  in  accordance  with  the
    Regulations for a continuous period of five  years  and  therefore  she
    would have to show a continuous period of five years of  treaty  rights
    being completed and it made reference to them not  being  divorced  and
    therefore the appellant  having  not  supplied  evidence  of  husband's
    employment to contribute to that five years' qualifying period  and  it
    makes reference to the Decree Absolute not being obtained.

The legal framework:

17. Regulation 10 of the Immigration (European Economic  Area)  Regulations
    2006 states that:
         "(5) A person satisfies the conditions in this paragraph if-
             (a)  he ceased to be a family member of a qualified person ...
             on the termination of the marriage ... of that person;
             (b)  he was residing in the United Kingdom in accordance  with
             these Regulations at the date of the termination;
             (c)  he satisfies the condition in paragraph (6); and
             (d)  either-
                  (i)  prior to the initiation of the  proceedings  for  the
                  termination of the  marriage  ...  the  marriage  ...  had
                  lasted for at least three years and  the  parties  to  the
                  marriage ... had resided in  the  United  Kingdom  for  at
                  least one year during its duration; ...
         (6)  The condition in this paragraph is that the person -
             (a)  is not an EEA national but  would,  if  he  were  an  EEA
             national, be a worker,  a  self-employed  person  or  a  self-
             sufficient person under Regulation 6"

18. Regulation 15 of the EEA Regulations states:
         "5.- (1) The following persons acquire the right to reside  in  the
             United Kingdom permanently-
                  (a)  an EEA national who has resided in the United Kingdom
                  in accordance with  these  Regulations  for  a  continuous
                  period of five years;
                  (b)  a family member of an EEA national who is not an  EEA
                  national but who has resided in the  United  Kingdom  with
                  the EEA national in accordance with these Regulations  for
                  a continuous period of five years;
                  (c)  a worker  or  self-employed  person  who  has  ceased
                  activity;
                  (d)  the family member of a worker or self-employed person
                  who has ceased activity, provided-
                      (i)  the person was the family member of  the  worker
                      or self-employed person at the point  the  worker  or
                      self-employed person ceased activity; and
                      (ii) at that point, the family member enjoyed a right
                      to reside on the basis of being the family member  of
                      that worker or self-employed person;
                  (e)  a person who was the family member  of  a  worker  or
                  self-employed person where-
                      (i)  the worker or self-employed person has died;
                      (ii) the family member resided  with  the  worker  or
                      self-employed person immediately  before  the  death;
                      and
                      (iii)     the  worker  or  self-employed  person  had
                      resided continuously in the  United  Kingdom  for  at
                      least two years immediately before dying or the death
                      was  the  result  of  an  accident  at  work  or   an
                      occupational disease;
                  (f)  a person who-
                      (i)  has resided in the United Kingdom in  accordance
                      with these Regulations for  a  continuous  period  of
                      five years; and
                      (ii) was, at the end of the period, a  family  member
                      who has retained the right of residence.
             (2)  Residence  in  the  United  Kingdom  as  a  result  of  a
             derivative right to reside does not constitute  residence  for
             the purpose of this regulation.
             (3)  The right of permanent residence under this regulation is
             lost through absence from the  United  Kingdom  for  a  period
             exceeding two years.
             (4)  A person who satisfies the criteria in this regulation is
             not entitled to a right to permanent residence in  the  United
             Kingdom where the Secretary of State or an immigration officer
             has made a decision under regulation 23(6)(b),  24(1),  25(1),
             26(3) or 31(1), unless that decision is set aside or otherwise
             no longer has effect."

19. In the decision of Idezuna (EEA - permanent residence)  Nigeria  [2011]
    UKUT 474 (IAC) it was held that "sometimes a  family  member  may  have
    acquired a right of permanent residence  on  the  basis  of  historical
    facts". In the Appellant's case,  she  had  married  her  EEA  national
    partner on 27 August 2011 and resided here  as  his  spouse  until  the
    divorce  petition  was  filed  on  the  18th  November  2016.  It   was
    potentially possible for her to accrue a right of  permanent  residence
    by aggregating her residence as a spouse and as a person with  retained
    rights of residence.  However,  she  would  still  have  to  show  that
    throughout the necessary five-year period her spouse was  exercising  a
    Treaty  right  or  she  was  meeting  the  requirements  to  meet   the
    requirements for retaining a right of residence.

20. I have considered the evidence of the appellant in conjunction with the
    documentary evidence provided. As set out earlier,  the  appellant  has
    little knowledge of her ex-spouses' employment and his history in  this
    regard. As she stated in evidence, one  of  the  reasons  the  marriage
    broke down was because he  had  been  secretive  concerning  his  daily
    activities. Her oral evidence was difficult  to  follow  and  from  the
    answers given in cross  examination  she  was  unable  to  provide  any
    background as to her  ex-spouses  work  history.  Her  account  of  his
    employment in the application form is not consistent with the enquiries
    made with the HMRC and she was unable to provide any other evidence  in
    support. I have no reason to disbelieve her account that she found  him
    unhelpful when she was seeking information  concerning  his  employment
    history when making her application under the EEA regulations. This  is
    supported by the fact that he failed to respond to the divorce petition
    when it was issued, and substituted service was therefore  required  by
    order of District Judge. The only information tat is reliable  is  that
    set out in the documentation from HMRC and DWP.

21. It is against that background that I have been required to consider the
    documentary   evidence   concerning   the   employment   history    and
    circumstances of the appellant's ex-spouse.  There  are  no  employment
    records held for the years 2006 - 2007 all for the years  2007  -  2008
    and the appellant has not stated in either oral or documentary evidence
    when her ex-spouse entered the United Kingdom.

22. Between 2008 - 2009 it is recorded that he was in employment and earned
    �344.35 and paid no tax or national insurance. It has been submitted on
    behalf of the respondent that all of the employment set out in the HMRC
    document for the years 2008 onwards does not demonstrate that he was in
    effective and genuine employment. On  behalf  of  the  appellant,  Miss
    Delbourgo submits that the evidence provided suggested that he may have
    been a jobseeker in the UK prior to his finding employment in  the  tax
    year 2008 - 09. She further submits that the documentary evidence  from
    the HMRC's records demonstrate that the  appellant's  ex-spouse  had  a
    series of temporary engagements for  which  he  was  taxed  under  PAYE
    making him an employee such that he meets the criteria set out  in  the
    decision of Lawrie-Blum EU case 66/85. Whilst her skeleton argument  at
    paragraph 12 refers to  the  "temporary  and  sporadic  nature  of  his
    employment" and that it may have appeared the  appellant  that  he  was
    self-employed, she submits that the HMRC  material  was  sufficient  to
    conclude that he was a "worker" within the meaning of the case  law  of
    the CJEU.

23. She further submitted  that  employment  can  be  part-time  but  still
    qualify as a "worker" within the meaning of EU law provided such  part-
    time work is "effective"  and  genuine  and  not  "purely  marginal  or
    ancillary" as provided in the case of Levin (see paragraph  13  of  her
    skeleton argument and  her  oral  submissions).  In  this  regard,  she
    submitted that the records provided by the  HMRC  demonstrate  that  he
    pursued a pattern of work which included relying  upon  the  income  of
    another family member and also by  his  receipt  of  either  jobseekers
    allowance or other benefits, ESA or disability living allowance.

24. I have therefore considered those  submissions  in  the  light  of  the
    documentary evidence and the oral evidence of the appellant, insofar as
    she could assist.

25. The definition of a worker was set out in the well-known case of Genc v
    Land Berlin [C-14/09] where the court held that the concept of a worker
    must not be interpreted narrowly  and  that  "any  person  who  pursues
    activities which are real and genuine to the exclusion of activities on
    such a small scale as to be purely  marginal  and  ancillary,  must  be
    regarded as a 'worker'".

26. The judgments of the Court of Justice of the  European  Union  in  D.M.
    Levin v Staatsecretaris van Justitie [1982] EUECJ R-53/81  and  Deborah
    Lawrie-Blum  v  Land  Baden-W�rttemberg  [1986]  EUECJ  R-66/68.   Both
    decisions were considered and taken into account by the Court of Appeal
    in Barry v London Borough of Southwark [2008] EWCA  Civ  1440  and  the
    Upper Tribunal's guidance in Begum (EEA - worker - jobseeker)  Pakistan
    [2011] UKUT 275 (IAC), which summarised the guidance thus:

         "(1) When deciding whether an EEA national  is  a  worker  for  the
         purposes of the EEA Regulations, regard must be  had  to  the  fact
         that the term has a meaning in EU law, that it must be  interpreted
         broadly and that it is not conditioned by the type of employment or
         the amount of income derived. But a  person  who  does  not  pursue
         effective and genuine activities or pursues activities  on  such  a
         small scale as to be regarded as purely marginal and  ancillary  or
         which have no economic value to an employer, is not  a  worker.  In
         this context, regard must be given to the nature of the  employment
         relationship and the rights and duties of the person  concerned  to
         decide if work activities are effective and genuine. ..."

27. The question addressed in the written submissions of Ms  Isherwood  was
    whether the appellant's ex-husband was pursuing effective  and  genuine
    economic activity or whether the activities were on such a small  scale
    as to be purely marginal and ancillary.

28. In Lawrie-Blum v Land Baden-Wurttemberg Case 66/85 [1986] ECR  2121  it
    was  found  that  the  essential  characteristic  of   the   employment
    relationship is the fact that during a given time one  person  provides
    services  for  and  under  the  direction  of  another  in  return  for
    remuneration.

29. The case law indicates that remuneration appears to  be  the  key,  but
    payment need not be enough to live on, or it may be in kind rather than
    a formal wage. In Kempf v Staatssecretaris  van  Justitie  Case  139/85
    [1986] ECL 1741, it was found that a person may still be a worker  even
    if their pay is so low that he or  she  needs  to  supplement  it  with
    unemployment benefit or has to apply  for  sickness  benefit  during  a
    period of illness, provided that the effectiveness and  genuineness  of
    the activities of the person are established.

30. Therefore, if the  work  is  genuine  and  effective,  and  not  purely
    marginal and incidental therefore, it can  be  considered  an  economic
    activity.

31. Furthermore the decisions  of  the  CJEU  demonstrate  that  part  time
    working counts as employment  for  the  purpose  of  exercising  Treaty
    Rights provided the work is genuine and provides an effective means for
    a person to earn a living even if it  needs  to  be  supplemented  from
    public funds - Levin (1982) EUECJ R-53/8.

32. I cannot accept the submission made by  Miss  Delbourgo  that  for  the
    years 2008 - 2009 that he was a jobseeker or at any time  before  then.
    There is no evidence of this, either by way  of  jobseeker's  allowance
    which would have been set out on the DWP information schedule as it was
    for the period in 2012. Furthermore, it would be unlikely that he was a
    jobseeker for the period from 2006 - 2008 which  is  a  period  of  two
    years. Nor can I accept that it is been demonstrated on the balance  of
    probabilities that his employment in the year 2008 - 2009 was  anything
    other than marginal in the context of the case law set out above. It is
    not been possible to consider the circumstances of  his  employment  at
    that time or his own personal circumstances because there has  been  no
    evidence of any kind provided in which to make that assessment or  even
    by way of inference.

33. However, in the light of the documentary evidence of the HMRC  and  DWP
    in conjunction with the appellant's oral evidence, I make the following
    findings of fact relating to the period there after. From 2009  -  2010
    and 2010 - 2011 the appellant's ex-spouse earned an income which  I  am
    satisfied was  not  marginal  and  incidental  but  properly  could  be
    considered  to  demonstrate  that  he  was  in  genuine  and  effective
    employment during these years. The evidence of the appellant  was  that
    he had signed up with a number of different  recruitment  agencies  and
    this is supported by the number of employees that he worked for at that
    time, albeit for smaller sums. I accept the  submission  made  by  Miss
    Delbourgo that he had a series of employers as set out in the documents
    and that even if it were part-time it would  not  disqualify  him  from
    qualifying as a "worker" within the meaning of EU law.

34. I accept the appellant's evidence that she was  in  employment  at  the
    same time and that her ex-husband's wage  and  her  wage  was  used  to
    support them jointly. In the circumstances  I  do  not  find  that  his
    employment can be described as purely marginal and  incidental,  and  I
    accept that it has been proved that the employment had been genuine and
    effective, even though lowly paid.

35.  For  2011  -  2012  the  appellant's  ex-spouse  was   employment   as
    demonstrated from the schedule and  for  the  periods  between  June  -
    August 2012, he received jobseekers' allowance. He  was  in  employment
    again 2012 - 2013 and it is further recorded that from October 2012  to
    date he is been in receipt of employment support allowance (hereinafter
    referred to as "ESA") and disability living allowance ("DLA").

36. As to those benefits, I am satisfied that the submission made on behalf
    of the appellant was correct and that as the appellant's ex-spouse  was
    granted ESA a proper inference  to  draw  from  that  is  that  the  UK
    authorities were satisfied that he was temporarily incapacitated.  This
    did not detract from his status as a "worker".

37. There is  no  dispute  that  the  date  the  divorce  proceedings  were
    initiated is the relevant date which in this case was 18 November 2016.
    Whilst the parties are separated prior to this date, whether or not the
    appellant was living  with  her  ex-spouse  throughout  the  period  is
    immaterial in light of PM (EEA  -  spouse  -  "residing  with")  Turkey
    [2011] UKUT 89 (IAC) and the guidance stated therein as to the  meaning
    of the phrase "residing with". [3].

38. The appellant's ex-spouse was in receipt of ESA and  DLA  and  for  the
    reasons that out above I am satisfied that  the  appellant's  ex-spouse
    had likely acquired a permanent right of residence  by  reason  of  his
    status as a worker and a qualified person and  having  exercised  those
    rights for a period of five years from 2009 - 2014 he  had  acquired  a
    permanent right of residence in 2014.  It  is  difficult  to  give  the
    precise months because the written documentation  from  the  government
    agencies do not specify  the  months  themselves  and  the  appellant's
    evidence did not assist.

39. I reject the argument advanced by Miss Isherwood that he did  not  have
    permanent residence because the GCID notes did not hold any information
    or record that a grant of permanent residence  had  been  made  to  the
    appellant's ex-spouse. That is in direct contravention to the directive
    and the regulations and the appellant's ex-spouse acquires a  permanent
    right of residence by operation of law. On the material evidence before
    me the likelihood is that he acquired this in 2014.

40. Consequently based on those findings, the  appellant  has  demonstrated
    that she meets the requirements for a retained right  of  residence  as
    the appellant's ex-spouse was exercising Treaty rights and on the basis
    of him having acquired right of permanent residence. From the  date  of
    her marriage in August 2011 until August 2016 she acquired the right of
    permanent residence as she was resident for that continuous  period  of
    five years and did so in accordance with the regulations. Therefore  if
    her ex-spouse was  either  a  qualified  person  or  had  acquired  the
    permanent right of residence for a period  of  five  years  during  the
    marriage, the appellant succeeds in establishing her right to permanent
    residence.

41. I should also add that it  is  common  ground  that  she  has  been  in
    employment both at the time of the parties separation, at the  time  of
    the degree absolute in 2018   and  at  the  date  of  the  hearing  and
    therefore she would have met the five year period by a  combination  of
    the earlier periods of residence as set out above  and  thereafter.  It
    had also been accepted by the respondent that the marriage  had  lasted
    for three years and that she and her former spouse had resided together
    for at least one year during the marriage (see decision letter).

42. For those reasons I therefore find that the appellant has proved on the
    balance of probabilities that she is a family member of an EEA national
    who has resided  in  the  United  Kingdom  with  the  EEA  national  in
    accordance with the 2016 Regulations for a continuous  period  of  five
    years. The requirements of Regulation 15 are satisfied, and the  appeal
    is allowed. The appellant is entitled to  permanent  residence  in  the
    United Kingdom.

Issue of costs:

43. The final issue related to the position as  to  costs.  Miss  Delbourgo
    made an application for the costs of the appellant to be  paid  by  the
    respondent.  The  application  was  based  on  the  position  that  the
    respondent should have made investigations with the  government  bodies
    and that after  the  HMRC  documentation  had  been  obtained,  further
    information was necessary from DWP and that the Home Office should have
    made all  the  enquiries  before  they  refused  the  application.  She
    submitted that the appellant had been put to the expense of  continuing
    with the appeal.

44. Ms Isherwood behalf of the Respondent submitted  that  there  may  have
    been a misunderstanding as to what enquiries were required and that the
    Secretary of State had not acted unreasonably in all the circumstances.
    She submitted that the Secretary of State was not  required  by  either
    the law by the guidance to undertake checks with the HMRC as set out in
    the decision of Amos and that the  appellant  had  not  undertaken  any
    enquiries of her own  despite  her  evidence  that  she  had  had  some
    connection  with  the  EEA  national  (  in  evidence  given  in  cross
    examination). Furthermore, the HMRC documentation had been obtained and
    the  DWP  information  was  sent  very  quickly  to   the   appellant's
    representatives. There had been no delay  thereafter  and  hearing  was
    necessary because the background evidence had not been  made  clear  in
    the evidence provided by the appellant and  the  burden  was  upon  the
    appellant to demonstrate that the Regulations were met.

45. I therefore considered those submissions when deciding whether  or  not
    to exercise any discretion that the Upper  Tribunal  may  have  in  the
    award of costs.

46. The relevant procedure rule is as follows:

         "(1) The Upper Tribunal may not make an order in respect  of  costs
         (or, in Scotland, expenses) in proceedings [transferred or referred
         by, or on appeal from,] another tribunal  except-"  [provisions  in
         relation to national security certificate appeals and under section
         4 of the Forfeiture Act 1982] ...

         (3)  In other proceedings, the Upper Tribunal may not make an order
         in respect of costs or expenses except-"

             (d)  if the Upper Tribunal  considers  that  a  party  or  its
             representative has acted unreasonably in  bringing,  defending
             or conducting the proceedings; ... "

47.  The Upper Tribunal has recently  reviewed  its  costs  jurisdiction  in
    statutory appeals in Thapa (costs:  general  principles;  s  9  review)
    [2018] UKUT 54. In making their  submissions  to  the  Upper  Tribunal,
    neither advocate made any submissions by reference to this decision  or
    to the principles that the Upper Tribunal should  apply.  The  decision
    set out above, emphasizes that the power to  award  costs  pursuant  to
    Rule 10 is to be exercised with significant  restraint  and  that  that
    detailed examinations of other decided cases are unlikely to assist  in
    deciding whether to award costs under either of those rules.

48.  I have therefore taken  that  decision  into  account  in  reaching  my
    decision on the issue of the costs.  Having  done  so  and  recognizing
    that the power to award costs  is  to  be  exercised  with  significant
    restraint, I am not satisfied that the conduct of  the  Respondent  was
    unreasonable. The history is set out in the decision of the  FtTJ  that
    the  respondent  did  make  enquiries  ex-spouse  but  there  had  been
    difficulties in obtaining the National Insurance number and it had  not
    been provided from the appellant's representatives (see letter 15  June
    2018). A negative check was therefore received. There had  been  little
    evidence given by the appellant either before the  FtTJ  J  or  in  the
    documentary evidence that has followed during  these  proceedings.   In
    the submissions made to the Upper Tribunal, it had been submitted  that
    the appellant's evidence (set out in the application form) that he  had
    sources of employment and self-employment which would include invoices,
    accountant's letters, least of business premises et cetera,  that  this
    would provide the basis for further enquiries. It is accepted now  that
    the appellant was mistaken about any form of self-employment as that is
    not reflected in the HMRC documentation. No account was  given  in  the
    short witness statements provided that the  appellant's  ex-spouse  was
    ever in receipt of any benefits. Much of the  recent  statement  relied
    upon issues relevant to Article 8 (which was not relevant in the  light
    of this as an EEA appeal and that no S120 notice had been served). I am
    satisfied that the DWP evidence was obtained in a very  short  time  by
    Ms. Isherwood and that it would have been open to the appellant's legal
    advisors to have applied for an adjournment of the hearing on the  20th
    May either by way of an application prior to the hearing or by  way  of
    agreement. No action was taken and therefore I am  not  satisfied  that
    there was  any  unreasonable  conduct  demonstrated  at  that  hearing.
    Furthermore, after the  service  of  the  evidence,  it  was  therefore
    necessary to  consider  the  documentary  evidence  obtained  from  the
    government departments in the light of the appellant's evidence and  in
    the light of the relevant case law.

49.  For those reasons, I am not satisfied that the  Respondent  should  pay
    the costs of the Appellant and I refuse the  application  made  by  Ms.
    Delbourgo. The previous costs order shall be maintained for the reasons
    I set out in the earlier decision. The  appellant  will,  in  addition,
    receive her fee back.

Summary:

50.  I therefore find that the Appellant has proved that  she  is  a  family
    member of an EEA national who has resided in the  United  Kingdom  with
    the EEA  national  in  accordance  with  the  2016  Regulations  for  a
    continuous period of five years. The requirements of regulation 15  are
    satisfied and the appeal is  allowed.  The  Appellant  is  entitled  to
    permanent residence in the United Kingdom.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the FTT contained material errors of law and was set  aside.
I substitute a fresh decision. The appeal is allowed pursuant  to  the  2016
