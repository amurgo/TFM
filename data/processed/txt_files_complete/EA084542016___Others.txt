                            DECISION AND REASONS




    BACKGROUND

      1. This is an appeal brought by the Secretary of State.  For  ease  of
         reference, I refer to the parties hereafter as  they  were  in  the
         First-tier Tribunal.  The Respondent appeals against a decision  of
         First-Tier Tribunal Judge Rowlands promulgated on 15  October  2018
         ("the Decision")  allowing  the  Appellants'  appeals  against  the
         Respondent's decision dated 30 June 2016  refusing  them  permanent
         residence cards as the former family members  of  an  EEA  national
         exercising Treaty rights in the UK, Mr Bertrand Dolmin,  who  is  a
         French national.  Both parties are agreed that, due to  the  timing
         of the Appellant's application to the Respondent and  the  relevant
         transitional  arrangements,  the  governing  regulations  are   the
         Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations   2006   ("the
         Regulations").

      2. The First Appellant is Mr Dolmin's  former  spouse  and  the  other
         three Appellants are her children.  Although they were born  on  28
         August 1995, 2 March 1989 and 21  November  1991  respectively  and
         therefore two of them were no longer under 21 years at the date  of
         the Respondent's decision, and all were over 21 years by  the  date
         of the hearing before Judge Rowlands, the Respondent did  not  take
         issue with their entitlement to permanent residence  as  dependents
         of the First Appellant in the event that she was  so  entitled.   I
         raised this issue at the hearing before me but, as Mr Salam rightly
         pointed out, there is no issue taken in the  Respondent's  decision
         letter, Mr Tarlow did not submit that the outcome of their  appeals
         should not follow from the result of the First  Appellant's  appeal
         and Mr Salam explained that all the children  remain  in  education
         and remain dependent on the  First  Appellant.   I  therefore  need
         consider only the position of the First Appellant who  I  refer  to
         hereafter as "the Appellant".

      3. The Respondent took issue in his decision with the  genuineness  of
         the Appellant's marriage to Mr Dolmin.  Even if that were  genuine,
         he did not accept that the Appellant could satisfy the  Regulations
         as he said that the evidence  did  not  show  that  Mr  Dolmin  was
         exercising Treaty rights prior to the divorce or that the Appellant
         was exercising Treaty rights as if she were an EEA  national  after
         the divorce.  The Respondent expressly  accepted  that  there  were
         payslips covering the period February 2012 to  September  2015  but
         said that the evidence prior to  February  2012  was  insufficient.
         There was therefore a gap from October 2010 (immediately  prior  to
         the grant of residence permits to the Appellants) for a  period  of
         five years. The Respondent also pointed to a lack of evidence  that
         the Appellant was exercising Treaty rights as if she  were  an  EEA
         national  after  her  divorce  in  August  2015.   The   Respondent
         therefore concluded that the Appellants had  not  shown  that  they
         were entitled to permanent residence  cards,  applying  regulations
         10(5, 10(6) and 15(1)(f) of the Regulations.

      4. The Judge accepted the Appellant's case that her marriage  was  not
         one of convenience.  There is no challenge  to  that  finding.   In
         relation to the remaining issues, the Judge concluded as follows:

             "[16]     ... I am not satisfied on the basis of the  evidence
             that has been provided that this was a marriage of convenience
             and believe that it certainly was a genuine marriage as far as
             she was concerned.  The Respondent is clearly  satisfied  that
             she continues to remain in the United  Kingdom  in  accordance
             with the EEA Regulations i.e. working and the  only  remaining
             issue is whether the former spouse is.

             [17]      I am satisfied that there is sufficient evidence  to
             show that he was working and exercising treaty rights up until
             2014 and that would have been more than five years after  they
             had been  married  and  that  this  shows  that  he  has  been
             exercising treaty rights for the  relevant  period.   Even  if
             there were some gaps towards the end of the period I  work  on
             the basis of the presumption of continuance.  If he  had  been
             working for many years in one job or  in  self-employment  and
             there was no indication that anything might  have  changed  in
             that respect then I have  no  reason  to  disbelieve  that  he
             wouldn't be so working.

             [18]      I am satisfied to the relatively low  standard  that
             all four Appellants meet the requirements for the issue of  an
             EEA residence card on a permanent basis."

      5. The Respondent's challenge  to  the  Decision  is,  in  essence,  a
         challenge to the failure to give  sufficient  reasons.   The  first
         ground is pleaded as such.  The second is a failure to take account
         of and/or resolve conflicts of fact or opinion on a material matter
         - in essence, that the Judge  has  misunderstood  the  Respondent's
         case when reaching the conclusions at the end of [16] and  at  [17]
         of the Decision.

      6. Permission to appeal  was  granted  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
         Lambert in the following terms (so far as relevant):

             "... [2]  The judge found that the Respondent had  not  proved
             that the 1st Appellant's  former  marriage  had  been  one  of
             convenience and that she had established  exercise  of  Treaty
             rights by her ex-husband.

             [3] The grounds argue failure to give adequate reasons for the
             latter conclusion and to resolve a key conflict as to the  1st
             Appellant's exercise of treaty rights since the divorce.

             [4] The reasoning  is  rendered  arguably  inadequate  by  the
             extremely brief content of paragraph 17 and the absence  there
             of any reference either to specific evidence  or  to  argument
             put forward by the Respondent.

             [5] The Respondent also points to  the  judge's  statement  at
             paragraph 16 to the effect that the  Secretary  of  State  was
             satisfied that  the  1st  Appellant  remained  in  the  United
             Kingdom according to EEA  Regulations,  maintaining  that  the
             Refusal letter had in fact taken issue with this.

             [6] There is therefore an arguable error of law  disclosed  by
             the application."

      7. The matter comes before me to decide whether the Decision  contains
         a material error of law and, if so,  to  re-make  the  decision  or
         remit the appeal for rehearing to the First-Tier Tribunal.

    ERROR OF LAW DECISION

      8. Mr Tarlow relied on the Respondent's grounds by reference  to  [16]
         and [17] of the Decision.  He accepted that there is  no  challenge
         to the finding that the marriage is not  one  of  convenience.   He
         accepted that the  Judge  may  have  been  entitled  to  reach  the
         conclusion he did, but the  Respondent  is  entitled  to  know  the
         reasons why he has lost.

      9. Mr Salam sought to persuade me that the findings at [16]  and  [17]
         are adequate.  He pointed out,  correctly  in  my  view,  that  the
         Decision has to be read  with  the  Respondent's  decision  as  the
         Respondent can be taken to know the detail of the case by reason of
         what he says in that decision.  He also pointed out, again rightly,
         that the conclusions reached by the Judge have to be read alongside
         the remainder of the Decision and in particular what the Judge says
         earlier about the evidence.

     10. However, when I pointed out to Mr Salam that the Judge said at [16]
         of the Decision that the Respondent had not taken  issue  with  the
         exercise of Treaty rights by the Appellant as if she  were  an  EEA
         national, his only response was that this was not relevant  because
         the Appellant married Mr Dolmin in February 2009 and had  therefore
         acquired a permanent right of residence as  his  family  member  in
         February 2014, prior to the divorce in 2015 and  did  not  have  to
         show that she was working before August 2015.  That is right if the
         Appellant had indeed acquired permanent residence prior to divorce.
          However, the Judge's assertion at  [16]  discloses  a  fundamental
         misunderstanding of the Respondent's case.

     11. That might not be material if the Judge's conclusions at [17] are a
         sustainable finding that the Appellant is entitled to  a  permanent
         residence card based on the position prior to divorce.   The  Judge
         there refers to there being sufficient evidence which, allied  with
         the presumption of continuance, deals with the gap towards the  end
         of  the  period.   However,  that   too   reveals   a   fundamental
         misunderstanding of the Respondent's case because his case is  that
         there was evidence that Mr Dolmin was exercising Treaty rights from
         February 2012 to September 2015 but insufficient evidence prior  to
         that date.  The Judge concludes that there is  sufficient  evidence
         up to 2014 but does not say what that is.  The Judge has  therefore
         failed to engage with the salient issue or provide reasons for  his
         conclusion.

     12. Mr Salam sought to persuade me that when the Judge referred to "end
         of the period" at [17], he was referring to the end of Mr  Dolmin's
         period as a self-employed person prior to commencing employment for
         others.  I had some difficulty understanding this  submission.   Mr
         Salam drew my attention to what is said at  [12]  of  the  Decision
         about the date when the Appellant acquired  a  permanent  right  of
         residence which may be  relevant  to  the  point  at  [16]  of  the
         Decision but does not relate to this issue. Even if the  Judge  was
         talking about the period of self-employment, that does not  resolve
         the issue because Mr Dolmin began working in the tax  year  2011-12
         and the period which the Respondent challenges  begins  in  October
         2010.  It is also unclear why the presumption of continuance  would
         assist when the period at issue was  prior  to  the  date  when  Mr
         Dolmin ceased to be self-employed and not after.  In any  event,  I
         reject Mr Salam's attempts to interpret the words "the  period"  as
         anything other than the period which  the  Judge  had  to  consider
         which  was  the  five-year  period  establishing  the   Appellant's
         entitlement to permanent residence.

     13. There is a further difficulty with the Judge's conclusions  in  his
         reference to suppositions rather than conclusions  about  what  the
         evidence shows.  He says that  "[e]ven  if  there  were  some  gaps
         towards the end of the period" without resolving whether those gaps
         exist.  He then says that "[i]f he had been working for many  years
         in one job or in self-employment and there was no  indication  that
         anything might have changed ..." without  reaching  any  conclusion
         whether that was what the evidence shows.

     14. The Respondent is entitled to know the reasons why he has lost just
         as is an appellant.  The Respondent  expressly  raised  two  issues
         regarding the exercise of Treaty rights by Mr  Dolmin  and  by  the
         Appellant.  The Judge has misunderstood the  Respondent's  case  on
         both counts, has failed to make any reference to what the documents
         show about  those  issues  and  has  failed  to  reach  conclusions
         supported by adequate reasons resolving the  conflict  between  the
         cases of the two parties.

     15. For those reasons, I am satisfied that the Respondent's grounds are
         made out.  The Respondent is entitled to reasons  why  the  appeals
         should be allowed.  I am also therefore satisfied that the error of
         law is material and that I should set aside the Decision  in  order
         to re-make it.   There  is  though  no  challenge  to  the  Judge's
         findings in relation to whether the marriage is one of convenience.
          Accordingly, I preserve the findings made in that regard.   I  set
         aside the  final  sentence  of  [16]  and  paragraph  [17]  of  the
         Decision.

     16. I see no need to re-hear oral evidence since there is no  challenge
         to the issue which most of that evidence concerns and the  findings
         which I need to re-make concern  the  documentary  evidence  rather
         than the Appellant's oral evidence.  Neither party invited me to re-
         hear evidence and I therefore also  preserve  the  record  of  that
         evidence as set out in the Decision.

     17. Both parties were content for me to re-make  the  decision  on  the
         papers based on the documentary evidence.  I indicated that, if  it
         appeared  to  me  when  reviewing  that  evidence,   that   further
         submissions or evidence was required, I would give  directions  for
         such to be produced.

     18. I now turn to re-make the decision.

    RE-MAKING OF DECISION

    Legal Framework

     19. The relevant provisions of the Regulations read as follows:

             "Family member who has retained the right of residence"

             10.-      (1)  In these Regulations, "family member who has
                  retained the right of residence" means, subject to
                  paragraph (8), a person who satisfies the conditions in
                  paragraph (2), (3), (4) or (5).

                  ...

                  (5)  A person satisfies the conditions in this paragraph
                  if-

                      (a)   he ceased to be a family member of a  qualified
                      person or of an EEA national with a  permanent  right
                      of residence on the termination of  the  marriage  or
                      civil partnership of that person;

                      (b)   he  was  residing  in  the  United  Kingdom  in
                      accordance with these Regulations at the date of  the
                      termination;

                      (c)   he satisfies the condition  in  paragraph  (6);
                      and

                      (d)   either-

                           (i)      prior   to   the   initiation   of   the
                           proceedings for the termination of  the  marriage
                           or the civil partnership the  marriage  or  civil
                           partnership had lasted for at least  three  years
                           and  the  parties  to  the  marriage   or   civil
                           partnership had resided in the United Kingdom for
                           at least one year during its duration;

                           (ii)    ...

                  (6)  The condition in this paragraph is that the person-

                      (a)   is not an EEA national but would, if he were an
                      EEA national, be a worker, a self-employed person  or
                      a self-sufficient person under regulation 6; or

                      (b)   is the family member  of  a  person  who  falls
                      within paragraph (a).

                  ...

                  (8)  A person with a permanent right of residence under
                  regulation 15 shall not become a family member who has
                  retained the right of residence on the death or departure
                  from the United Kingdom of the qualified person or the EEA
                  national with a permanent right of residence or the
                  termination of the marriage or civil partnership, as the
                  case may be, and a family member who has retained the
                  right of residence shall cease to have that status on
                  acquiring a permanent right of residence under regulation
                  15."




             "Permanent right of residence

             15.-      (1)  The following persons shall acquire the right
                  to reside in the United Kingdom permanently-

                      (a)   ... ;

                      (b)   a family member of an EEA national who  is  not
                      himself an EEA national but who has  resided  in  the
                      United Kingdom with the EEA  national  in  accordance
                      with these Regulations for  a  continuous  period  of
                      five years;

                      ...

                      (f)   a person who-

                           (i)     has resided  in  the  United  Kingdom  in
                           accordance   with   these   Regulations   for   a
                           continuous period of five years; and

                           (ii)    was, at the end of that period, a  family
                           member who has retained the right of residence.

                  ..."

    20.    I begin with a statement of the dates which are relevant  to  my
         assessment of the evidence.  The Appellant married Mr Dolmin on  24
         February 2009.  From that point  in  time  she  became  his  family
         member under the  Regulations  notwithstanding  that  she  did  not
         obtain a permanent residence card until 29 November 2010.  No  date
         is given  for  when  divorce  proceedings  were  issued.   That  is
         relevant to the date when it must  be  shown  that  Mr  Dolmin  was
         exercising Treaty rights.  However, the decree nisi was  pronounced
         on 2 June 2015 and the decree absolute followed on 17 August  2015.
         The Respondent does not take issue with the evidence  showing  that
         Mr Dolmin was exercising Treaty rights  at  both  those  dates  and
         dating back to February 2012.  He is right not to take  issue  with
         the evidence for that period as there is a complete set of payslips
         for that period supported also now by evidence from  HMRC  for  the
         years 2012-13 up to 2016-17.

     20. If the Appellant can show that  Mr  Dolmin  was  exercising  Treaty
         rights at the date  when  they  married,  she  became  entitled  to
         permanent residence on 24 February 2014.  I  therefore  begin  with
         what the evidence shows about the period to February 2012 which  is
         disputed by the Respondent.

     21. HMRC has produced information in relation to Mr Dolmin's employment
         also for the  tax  years  2010-11  and  2011-12.   In  2010-11,  he
         declared �8125  earnings  from  self-employment.   In  2011-12,  he
         declared earnings  from  self-employment  of  �7298  together  with
         earnings from  employment  of  �2086,  �511,  �877  and  �34.   The
         declaration for 2010-11 is consistent with the tax return  produced
         for that year.  There is also produced a tax return  for  the  year
         2009-2010 which shows business income of �7570.  A further document
         sets out the tax calculation for 2011-12 which, whilst  it  differs
         slightly in relation  to  self-employed  earnings  (�5963  v  �7298
         according  to  the  HMRC  information)  is  consistent   with   the
         information given about employment earnings of �3508.

     22. I am therefore satisfied that the evidence shows that Mr Dolmin was
         exercising Treaty rights in the period 2009 to  2012.  I  recognise
         that the evidence of the tax return for  2009-2010  does  not  show
         when in that year Mr Dolmin was working, taken  alone.   There  are
         however bills for national insurance contributions for the period 4
         January 2009 to 11 April 2009 (for �18.40) and for 10 January  2010
         to 10 April  2010  (for  �31.20).   On  balance,  therefore,  I  am
         satisfied that Mr Dolmin was working, albeit possibly  not  earning
         very much, from January 2009 onwards and certainly from April  2009
         onwards and up to the period which is not  disputed  from  February
         2012.

     23. Taken  at  its  lowest,  the  evidence  therefore  shows  that  the
         Appellant was entitled to a permanent right of residence  in  April
         2014 as the family member of Mr Dolmin.  At that time,  the  couple
         were still married.  Accordingly, the Appellant does  not  have  to
         show that she retained a right of residence after the divorce.  She
         already had that right before she was divorced from Mr Dolmin.

     24. Even if I am wrong about that and, as  the  Respondent  appears  to
         suggest, that the Appellant must  show  that  she  was  either  the
         family member of Mr Dolmin when he was exercising Treaty rights  or
         in her own right as if she were an EEA national, from  29  November
         2010 to November 2015, I am satisfied that she is able  to  satisfy
         the requirements of the Regulations.

     25. The Appellant ceased to be a family member on 17 August 2015.   The
         evidence contains pay  slips  and/or  remittance  advices  for  the
         company for which she works and of which she is a director dated 24
         and 31 July 2015, 7, 14, 21, 23 and 28 August 2015 and 15  November
         2015.  She has remained a director of  the  company  from  2015  to
         2017.  Therefore, although there is no evidence of income  received
         in the period 28 August to 15 November 2015  or  thereafter,  I  am
         satisfied that she has been exercising Treaty rights throughout the
         requisite period.

     26. For those  reasons,  the  Appellant  is  entitled  to  a  permanent
         residence card confirming her permanent right to reside in the  UK.
         As I have already indicated, no issue is taken with the  rights  of
         the other Appellants also  to  permanent  residence  cards  as  the
         Appellant's dependents.

     27. For those reasons, these appeals are allowed.

    DECISION

    I am satisfied that the Decision contains a material error of law.  The
    decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Rowlands  promulgated  on  15
    October 2018 is set aside to the extent set out at [15] and [16] above.



    I re-make the decision.  I allow the Appellants' appeals.
