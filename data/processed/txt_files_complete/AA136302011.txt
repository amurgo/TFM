Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Vietnam, born on 20 October 1990.

 2. The following is a summary of the account  which  appellant  gave  when
    interviewed by the respondent, with her corrections as put forward in a
    letter from her solicitors.  Her mother died when she was aged 10.  She
    was then brought up by an  aunt.   She  stabbed  her  cousin  during  a
    violent disagreement in 2002.  She left her aunt's house to stay with a
    neighbour.  In the same year, she  travelled  with  that  neighbour  to
    China.  She became a servant to a group of prostitutes  and  later  was
    forced into prostitution.  She  was  trafficked  into  prostitution  in
    France around 2007 and into the UK in 2008.  She went out  only  twice,
    to have abortions.  She escaped on 1 May 2011 when  taken  to  hospital
    due to a miscarriage.  She worked in shops and sold scarves to  support
    herself.  She was arrested on suspicion of shoplifting  on  25  October
    2011, an allegation which she denied.  Having received information from
    the police, she made her  asylum  application  at  the  Croydon  asylum
    screening unit the next day.

 3. The respondent refused the claim for  reasons  explained  in  a  letter
    dated 25 November 2011:

         the appellant was accepted to be Vietnamese (�10);

         her account of a risk arising from an incident with her cousin  was
         not credible, but if it did  occur  it  did  not  give  rise  to  a
         protection claim (�11-26);

         she might have been trafficked at age 12 - a separate referral  had
         been made to the "competent authority" to decide that (�29);

         as to any risk  of  being  trafficked  again  she  could  seek  the
         assistance  of  the  authorities  in   Vietnam   (�31)   or   other
         organisations, particularly as she was now over 21 and aware of the
         risks (�32-35);

         being Vietnamese speaking,  educated  [to  primary  level],  young,
         healthy and resourceful, she would be able to fend for  herself  in
         Vietnam (�37-38);

         there were organisations in Vietnam to  help  her,  and  she  could
         benefit from an assisted return (�39-40);

         she did not qualify for refugee or humanitarian protection or under
         Article 3 of the ECHR;

         her removal would not be a disproportionate  breach  of  rights  to
         family and private life; and

         all known factors having been considered under  paragraph  395C  of
         the Immigration Rules, it was appropriate to remove her to Vietnam.



 4. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  Her grounds  simply
    insisted that her evidence was credible (although  adverse  credibility
    findings were not at the heart of the respondent's decision), that  she
    could not live safely anywhere in Vietnam, and that she was at risk  of
    being re-trafficked.

 5. Among the documents which the appellant  submitted  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal there is a letter dated 12 January 2012  from  the  UK  Border
    Agency as the "competent authority".   This  finds  that  although  the
    appellant was trafficked those circumstances no longer exist, and  that
    she does not qualify for leave to remain because she is  not  currently
    assisting with police investigations and  does  not  have  any  complex
    needs which would require her to remain in the UK.

 6. A  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal  by
    determination promulgated on 20 February 2012.  Permission to appeal to
    the Upper Tribunal was granted because arguably the judge ought to have
    adjourned (a) in the  unexpected  absence  of  the  appellant  and  (b)
    pending an expert report.  The respondent did not respond to the  grant
    of permission.  By decision dated 21 May 2012 the  Upper  Tribunal  set
    aside the  determination  and  remitted  the  case  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal to be heard entirely afresh.

 7. Another First-tier Tribunal Judge, Judge Edwards, dismissed the  appeal
    by determination promulgated on 3 July 2012.

 8. The appellant sought permission to appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  on
    these grounds:

         (i) error in approach to expert evidence - a  report  by  Professor
         Bluth was too lightly rejected;

         (ii) no analysis of case law relied upon by the appellant, relevant
         to risk of re-trafficking;

         (iii) no analysis of country background information,  which  showed
         that government measures were ineffective;

         (iv) absence of separate consideration of Articles 2 and 2  of  the
         ECHR;

         (v) having regard to s.8 of the 2004 Act, although  the  respondent
         had not relied upon any such point; and

         (vi) failing to make findings on paragraph 395C of the  Immigration
         Rules.

 9. On 39 July 2012, permission to appeal was granted, on the view that the
    judge arguably gave inadequate reasons for dismissing the  evidence  of
    the expert, whose evidence had been approved by the Upper Tribunal  and
    by the Court of Appeal in two cases about Korea.

10. In response to the grant of permission the respondent  served  a  reply
    arguing  that  the  expert  evidence  was  adequately   considered   at
    paragraphs 22 and 29; that there was no failure to deal  with  relevant
    case law; and that separate consideration of Articles 2 and 3  had  not
    been called for.

11. There was then delay in dealing with the case, for various reasons: the
    appellant's solicitors suggested that it might be suitable for  country
    guidance, although that has not eventually been found appropriate;  she
    moved to Scotland, leading to a change of hearing  venue;  she  changed
    solicitors twice; directions of the Upper Tribunal  were  not  complied
    with; and she failed to appear at a hearing on 4  November  2014,  when
    her  solicitors  withdrew,  she  having  changed  her  address  without
    advising them and they having been unable to communicate with her.  The
    respondent's representative was able to provide an up to  date  address
    (in Falkirk) and the information that the appellant  was  due  to  give
    birth in January 2015.  In that light, the  Upper  Tribunal  issued  an
    order and detailed directions dated 4 November 2014, and the  case  was
    set down for hearing on 13 May 2015.  All documents were  sent  to  the
    appellant's up to date address.

12. The appellant did not communicate with the Upper Tribunal prior  to  13
    May 2015, and she did not then appear.  Nothing has been heard from her
    or from anyone on her behalf  up  to  the  time  of  promulgating  this
    determination.  Mr Matthews again confirmed her last known address.  He
    also said that the  respondent  had  written  to  her  after  the  last
    hearing, including advice that she should instruct solicitors.  He  had
    checked records as to her reporting requirement.  She failed to  report
    to Falkirk police station on the last two monthly  dates,  and  if  she
    again fails to report next week, she will be listed by  the  respondent
    as an absconder.

13. In those circumstances it was appropriate under the Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008, rule 38, to proceed with  the  hearing  in
    absence of the appellant.

14. The first question is whether  the  First-tier  Tribunal  determination
    errs in point of law.

15. The expert report dated 28 June 2012  says  at  paragraph  2  that  the
    author is Professor of  International  Studies  at  the  University  of
    Leeds; his expertise is in international relations; he has considerable
    knowledge of Vietnam; as a specialist in the geopolitics of Asia he has
    studied and taught about Vietnam for over twenty years; and he recently
    supervised a Vietnamese doctoral candidate engaged in primary  research
    on  his  country.   He  lists  and  summarises  the  materials  he  has
    considered.  His conclusions are at paragraphs 6.  Taking into  account
    the appellant's background and lack of support  and  the  operation  of
    criminal networks with which it is "practically  inevitable"  that  she
    will come into contact he finds a "high risk ... that she will  be  the
    target of trafficking gangs and that not  sufficient  support  will  be
    available to protect her."

16. Paragraph 22 of the determination is a summary of the  report.   It  is
    even briefer than the above, although it is of course not necessary  to
    quote all materials at length.  The only analysis is at paragraph 29:

         "The question then arises what the risk ... would be on return  ...
         I have disregarded  the  report  of  Professor  Bluth.   He  is  an
         historian who is an expert on international relations.  He does not
         say that he has ever visited Vietnam, or that he  has  studied  the
         social consequences arising there from trafficking.   He  does  not
         say what the subject of his doctorate is, or, indeed, what that  of
         the person he is supervising is.  I therefore do not find  that  he
         is an expert on the matters on which he has opined."

17. It would be unobjectionable to observe that the subject matter of  this
    case does not appear to be very close  to  the  Professor's  particular
    area of expertise.  The ideal expert would speak Vietnamese (an ability
    which Professor Bluth does not claim) and would have studied the  topic
    directly.  However, the activities of trafficking gangs are  manifested
    not only at the personal level but as  an  aspect  of  relations  among
    countries within  Southeast  Asia  and  with  the  rest  of  the  world
    including Europe.  It would be  reasonable  (indeed  the  duty  of  the
    tribunal) to  weigh  the  report  rather  than  simply  to  accept  its
    conclusions, to evaluate its conclusions in light of such observations,
    and  perhaps  to  find  its  conclusions  over-stated.   But   although
    Professor Bluth may not be an expert on the narrower focus of the  case
    (e.g., the practical availability of refuges) his remit does go to  the
    wider aspect (e.g., the international aspect of  trafficking).   In  my
    opinion it was an error to find him not to be an expert on  the  matter
    at all.  Mr Matthews did not seek to argue otherwise.

18. Is this an error which requires the determination to be set aside?  The
    other reasons for dismissing the appeal  are  at  paragraph  30  -  the
    government takes measures and there is protection in place to meet  the
    Horvath test; and at paragraph 31 - the appellant would not be deprived
    and unsupported, she admitted to being in touch with  friends  and  she
    could re-integrate.  Those findings are far  from  plainly  wrong,  but
    they are meagre in relation to a  case  which  was  thoroughly  put  in
    written submissions (and presumably in oral submissions, although these
    are recorded only briefly at paragraph 24).  Mr  Matthews  acknowledged
    that the incorrect elimination of an expert report was an error of some
    significance, and that  the  rest  of  the  reasoning  to  support  the
    decision was skimpy.

19. Determinations should be as concise  and  to  the  point  as  possible.
    However, what remains of this determination is not robust enough for it
    to stand.  The next issue is therefore the remaking of the decision.

20. There was nothing from the appellant to assist further, but Mr Matthews
    was able to help from the respondent's records.  The address in Falkirk
    did not appear to be one provided through  the  respondent  or  by  any
    other state body.  The appellant would not have been entitled  to  more
    than basic benefit for  living  expenses.   She  would  not  have  been
    entitled to accommodation or to benefit to cover rent.  She would  have
    had a motive to advise the respondent of the birth of a child,  because
    that would result in a small increase in benefit paid.  However,  there
    was no copy birth certificate on record with the respondent.

21. Further enquiry by Mr Matthews disclosed a note  that  the  appellant's
    asylum support claim was closed on 2 December 2014, on information from
    the social work department that she was working in a  nail  bar,  above
    which her accommodation was situated.  Any employment  would  not  have
    been legally permitted.  She was said  to  be  living  there  with  her
    boyfriend, whose initials are H T U, born on 31  May  1991.   That  was
    similar to a Home Office record of a failed asylum seeker, although the
    identification was not certain.  It appeared that she had given  birth,
    but further details were lacking.

22. Withdrawal of asylum support would explain why the  appellant  did  not
    let the respondent know about the birth of any child, as she would  not
    expect to gain by doing so.  The father of her child may or may not  be
    the same person noted as a boyfriend.  The  information  suggests  that
    the appellant now has some family support.  It is probable  that  there
    is no relationship with anyone  with  any  immigration  or  citizenship
    status which might have been cited in support of her case.   She  seems
    to have chosen consciously to "go to ground" rather than advancing  her
    claim.

23. I am satisfied that former victims of trafficking in Vietnam constitute
    members of a  particular  social  group  within  the  meaning  of  that
    Convention,  as  appears  to  have  been  implicitly  accepted  by  the
    respondent from the outset (and cf. AZ (Trafficked Women)  Thailand  CG
    [2010] UKUT 118).    There are no Article 8 or other available  grounds
    of appeal which might realistically avail the appellant.

24. It was correctly conceded on the appellant's side in prior  proceedings
    that the incident in  2002  does  not  give  rise  to  risk  now.   The
    respondent's analysis of this issue is impeccable.

25. On return the appellant would not be among  the  elite  or  the  middle
    class in Vietnam, but she would be no  worse  off  and  as  capable  of
    providing for herself (and her child) as the bulk  of  the  population,
    and she would start with the respondent's  fairly  generous  assistance
    (see below).  (If she  had  the  potential  support  of  a  husband  or
    partner, so much  the  better  for  her,  but  I  do  not  have  enough
    information to draw that conclusion.)  Her case could  not  succeed  on
    the basis of her likely circumstances,  without  a  real  risk  of  re-
    trafficking.  The existence of such a  risk  would  qualify  her  as  a
    refugee, and is the decisive issue.

26. The factors reasonably pointed to so far on the respondent's  side  are
    set out at �31-40 of the refusal letter, summarised above.

27.  Mr  Matthews  referred  also  to  more  recent  publications  by   the
    respondent, including an Operational Guidance Note (OGN) of June  2013,
    in particular the following sections:

         3.11.10   The  Vietnamese  government  sustained  some  efforts  to
         protect victims  of  transnational  sex  trafficking  and  outlined
         additional victim protection plans in its new anti-trafficking law,
         though it did not make sufficient efforts during 2011  to  identify
         or protect victims of labour trafficking or internal trafficking.

         3.11.11  The  government's  Vietnamese  Women's  Union  (VWU),   in
         partnership with  NGOs,  continued  to  operate  three  trafficking
         shelters  in  Vietnam's  largest   urban   areas,   which   offered
         counselling and  vocational  training  to  female  sex  trafficking
         victims. The VWU and border guards also  operate  smaller  shelters
         that provide temporary assistance to migrants in need of assistance
         at some of the most heavily used crossing points.  The  government,
         however, lacks the resources and technical expertise to  adequately
         support shelters, and as a  result,  in  many  areas  shelters  are
         rudimentary, underfunded and lack appropriately trained  workforce.
         Trafficking victims also are inappropriately  housed  at  times  in
         MOLISA shelters co-located with those of drug users' rehabilitation
         and reintegration of individuals leaving prostitution. There are no
         shelters or  services  specifically  dedicated  to  assisting  male
         victims of trafficking or victims of labour trafficking.

         3.11.12 The government reportedly encourages victims to  assist  in
         the prosecution of their traffickers, though Vietnam generally does
         not provide police-assisted witness protection to victims of crime.
         There  were  no  data  on  the  number  of  victims   involved   in
         prosecutions during 2010 or 2011. Victims are  often  reluctant  to
         participate in investigations  or  trials  due  to  social  stigma,
         particularly as it relates to prostitution, fear of retribution  in
         their local communities and lack of incentives  for  participation.
         Vietnamese law does have provisions to protect trafficking  victims
         from  facing  criminal  charges  for  actions  taken  as  a  direct
         consequence of being trafficked. There are  no  legal  alternatives
         for the removal of foreign victims to  countries  where  they  face
         retribution or hardship.

         3.11.13 The  Government  of  Vietnam  failed  to  provide  adequate
         remedies to overseas workers who experienced debt bondage or  other
         forms of forced labour. During 2011,  the  government  drafted  new
         victim identification procedures. In 2011, the government finalised
         and disseminated a five year (2011-2015) national  action  plan  on
         human trafficking and announced the allocation of the equivalent of
         $15 million to implement this  plan,  which  covers  all  forms  of
         trafficking  and  co-ordinates  the  government's  anti-trafficking
         responses  through  the  National  Steering  Committee   on   Human
         Trafficking chaired by Deputy  Prime  Minister  Nguyen  Xuan  Phuc.
         Although police officials acknowledged  that  internal  trafficking
         and trafficking of men may constitute significant segments  of  the
         country's trafficking problem, the Government took  no  discernible
         actions to increase efforts to address these  particular  forms  of
         trafficking during 2011.

28. The Country of Origin Information Report (COIR)  dated  9  August  2013
    overlaps with the OGN, but appears to draw on more recent sources:

         24.16 With regards to offering shelters for male and female victims
         of trafficking, the USSD TiP [Trafficking in Persons] Report  2013,
         stated:

         "The government's Vietnamese Women's Union  (VWU),  in  partnership
         with NGOs [non-governmental organisations] and with  foreign  donor
         funding,  continued  to  operate  three  trafficking  shelters   in
         Vietnam's largest urban areas; the shelters provided counseling and
         vocational training to female sex trafficking victims. The VWU  and
         border guards also operate smaller shelters that provide  temporary
         assistance to migrants in need at some of  the  most  heavily  used
         crossing points. At times victims were housed in Ministry of Labor,
         Invalids, and Social Affairs  (MOLISA)  social  protection  centers
         that provide  services  to  a  wide  range  of  vulnerable  groups,
         although officials acknowledged that victims were better served  in
         trafficking specific shelters."

         24.17 The USSD TiP Report 2013 added:

         "In many areas shelters  are  rudimentary,  underfunded,  and  lack
         appropriately trained personnel. There are no shelters or  services
         specifically dedicated to assisting male victims, child victims, or
         victims of labor trafficking, although existing shelters reportedly
         provided services to some male and child victims. NGOs report  some
         victims opt not to stay at a victim  support  facility  or  receive
         social services due to a fear of social stigma from identifying  as
         a trafficking victim. Trafficking victims are eligible for  a  cash
         subsidy up to the equivalent of  approximately  $50,  paid  through
         local authorities; the government did not provide statistics on the
         number of victims who received this benefit."

         24.18 The UNIAP website, accessed on 4 July 2013, stated:

         "This work consists of identification, rescue,  legal  proceedings,
         repatriation, recovery, reception and reintegration  of  trafficked
         women and children particularly from abroad. The  local-level  sub-
         committee and international  organizations  provide  medical  care,
         counseling and initial  support.  As  of  May  2011,  there  are  9
         shelters and reception centers which are located in Ha  Noi,  Quang
         Ninh, Lao Cai (2), Lang Son, An Giang (2), Can Tho and Ho Chi  Minh
         City. These  shelters  and  centers  provide  food,  accommodation,
         medical  care,  counseling  and  vocational  training.  The  victim
         protection  agencies  involved  in  the  Reintegration  Network  to
         support returned victims  of  trafficking  in  Vietnam  attempt  to
         strengthen  referral  systems  and  capacity-building  for   social
         workers, police, hotline operators and others ... 60 %  of  victims
         were self-returnees, 19% were rescued and 21% were repatriated."

29. The main factors pointed to on the appellant's  side  are  as  follows,
    taken mainly from the written submissions by her counsel in the  First-
    tier Tribunal.  She has suffered past persecution.  That is generally a
    serious indication for the future, unless there  are  good  reasons  to
    consider there will be no repetition (Immigration Rule  339K;  this  is
    another way of posing the live issue).  She is an orphan, known as such
    in her  home  area.   State  protection  needs  to  be  realistic,  not
    theoretical, and the  respondent  had  accepted  that  Vietnam's  anti-
    trafficking record remains poor.  The factors to be assessed on a case-
    by-case  basis  as  in  AZ  include  age,  marital   status,   domestic
    background, educational  level,  qualifications  and  work  experience.
    While it might be said that the appellant  would  be  wiser  next  time
    round, it  is  also  arguable  that  a  former  victim  might  be  more
    vulnerable (AZ at �150).

30. The written submissions,  as  I  have  observed,  are  thorough.   They
    contain every significant point which could have been advanced for  the
    appellant.  On one issue, however, I find them clearly mistaken.   They
    argue that the Vietnamese authorities will not allow the  appellant  to
    have the  benefit  of  the  reintegration  assistance  offered  by  the
    respondent.  The evidence cited relates to lack of assistance from  the
    Vietnamese government.  It does not suggest that the government  stands
    in the way of assistance from the respondent.  There is no  reason  why
    that should be the case.

31. There has been some improvement in what is on offer from government and
    other sources in Vietnam.   It  remains  meagre  compared  to  what  is
    offered  by  the  respondent.   Mr  Matthews  pointed  out   that   the
    respondent's help takes such forms as direct  payments,  assistance  in
    finding employment or setting up a small business, and the provision of
    initial accommodation, and that the return of a  failed  asylum  seeker
    with a child is an elaborate and carefully planned exercise.

32. There is  evidence  of  large-scale  trafficking.   It  affects  mainly
    younger  girls  and  women  from  deprived  backgrounds,  such  as  the
    appellant.  There is no specific evidence about the risk of  women  who
    have escaped from such a life being re-trafficked into it.  It would be
    impossible to say that there is never  any  such  risk.   I  take  into
    account the report by Professor Bluth but  for  the  reasons  indicated
    above and in context of the rest of the evidence I do  not  accept  its
    conclusion there is "a high risk".  The appellant may not  attract  the
    attention of traffickers again.  Even if she does, she should  be  able
    to resist it.

33. The appellant has been the victim of the relevant  risk  in  her  past,
    over a period of several years.  The risk of her being a  victim  again
    is likely to have reduced now that she is aged 24 and  sadly  has  seen
    some of the worse ways of the world.  There ultimate answer is not much
    affected by the availability of  assistance  from  Vietnamese  sources,
    which is not at a high level, but it is significantly affected  by  the
    resettlement package on offer, the greater personal resilience she  may
    now be expected to have, and her indifference to  the  outcome  of  her
    case.  She has not established the necessary subjective  element,  i.e.
    that she remains outside her country of nationality owing to a fear  of
    persecution.  Nor in my opinion does the evidence as a whole  show  any
    risk of re-trafficking to be a real rather than a  remote  or  fanciful
    one.

34. The determination  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  is  set  aside.   The
    following decision is substituted: the appeal, as originally brought to
    the First-tier Tribunal, is dismissed on all available grounds.

35. An anonymity direction was made by  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  and  is
    confirmed.  Unless and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise, the
    appellant is granted anonymity.  No report of these  proceedings  shall
    directly or indirectly identify her or any member of her family.   This
    direction applies both to the appellant and to the respondent.  Failure
    to  comply  with  this  direction  could  lead  to  contempt  of  court
    proceedings.
