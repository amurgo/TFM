                          LIGIA ELIYA MATTI SHEMISS

                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms H Aboni, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    No appearance.
                       NOTICE OF ABANDONMENT OF APPEAL

Notice of hearing was sent to the Respondent's last known address on 3  July
2017 and so she has been given proper notice of the  hearing  in  accordance
with the rules.

This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a decision of the First-
tier Tribunal on 27 February 2017 allowing in her absence  the  Respondent's
appeal against a decision of the Secretary of State refusing her asylum.

It is now clear that the Respondent voluntarily left the United  Kingdom  on
12 January 2017.

It  follows  that,  pursuant  to  section  104(4A)   of   the   Nationality,
Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  and  paragraph  17A(2)  of  the  Tribunal
Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 this appeal is abandoned.

I set aside the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  I  substitute  a
decision recording that the Appeal was abandoned by operation of law.

|Signed                               |                                     |
|Jonathan Perkins                     |                                     |
|Judge of the Upper Tribunal          |Dated 8 September 2017               |
