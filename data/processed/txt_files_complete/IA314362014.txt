Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr J Wells, Counsel, instructed by M&K Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellant, a national of Pakistan, date of birth 29  October  1989,
    appealed against the Respondent's decision,  dated  30  July  2014,  to
    refuse to issue  a  residence  card  under  the  Immigration  (European
    Economic Area) Regulations 2006, Regulation 2, on the  basis  that  the
    marriage between the Appellant and her  EEA  national  Sponsor,  Marius
    Ghita, was sham.

2.   Her appeal against that decision came before First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    Somal (the judge) who, on 23 February 2015, dismissed the appeal  under
    the 2006 Regulations.

3.   Permission to appeal was given by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Landes  on
    27 April 2015.

4.   The Respondent served a Rule 24 response on 13 May 2015.

5.   At the hearing before me Mr Melvin  and  Mr  Wells  accepted  that  the
    judge had failed to deal with the allegation that the marriage  between
    the Appellant and Sponsor EEA national was a  marriage  of  convenience
    and a sham.  Mr Wells said that in effect part of the problem was  that
    the Respondent having had refused the EEA national Sponsor entry to the
    United Kingdom, the Sponsor was having to conduct  an  out  of  country
    appeal against the refusal of entry clearance.

6.   A further  issue  was  raised,  although  it  is  somewhat  confusingly
    expressed in the  grant  of  permission,  as  to  whether  or  not  the
    Appellant can be dependent upon children of the EEA  national  Sponsor.
    The question is with  reference  to  Regulation  7(1)(c)  of  the  2006
    Regulations and is directed at whether or  not  a  stepmother  in  such
    circumstances can qualify under those provisions.  I express no view as
    to whether or not that issue has any prospects of success.

7.   It is, however, agreed that the judge did not give adequate  or  proper
    reasons and failed to address the issue of the  sham  marriage  and  in
    those circumstances such limited findings of fact  as  the  judge  made
    really cannot stand.  It is agreed that the  matter  will  have  to  be
    fully remade by the First-tier Tribunal.

8.   The Original Tribunal's decision cannot stand. The  appeal  is  allowed
    to the extent that the matter is  to  be  returned  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal to be decided in accordance with the law.
