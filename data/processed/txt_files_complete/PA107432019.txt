                         (ANONYMITY DIRECTION MADE)
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


     DECISION PURSUANT TO RULE 40(3)(a) OF THE TRIBUNAL PROCEDURE (UPPER
                            TRIBUNAL) RULES 2008

 1. In a decision promulgated on 22  January  2021,  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Pickup set aside a decision of the First-tier Tribunal which  dismissed
    the appellant's appeal against a decision dated 14 October 2019,  being
    a decision to refuse a protection claim. He directed that there be a re-
    making of the decision in the Upper Tribunal.

 2. By a response dated 28 January 2021, to directions given by  the  Upper
    Tribunal ("the Tribunal") the respondent  accepts  that  the  appellant
    would be likely to be required  to  perform  military  service  on  his
    return to Eritrea and that consequently he should  be  granted  refugee
    status. Accordingly, the respondent invites the Tribunal to  allow  the
    appellant's appeal.

 3. By  email  dated  25  March  2021,  on  behalf  of  the  appellant  the
    appellant's solicitors indicate that they  have  no  objection  to  the
    course proposed by the respondent.

 4. In the circumstances, I re-make the decision and allow  the  appeal  on
    asylum grounds, and on human rights grounds  under  Article  3  of  the
    ECHR.

 5. Pursuant to rule 40(3)(a) of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
    Rules 2008, no reasons (or further reasons) are required, the  decision
    being made with the consent of the parties.


Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Because this is a protection claim, unless and until  a  Tribunal  or  court
directs otherwise, the appellant is granted anonymity.  No report  of  these
proceedings shall directly or indirectly identify him or any member  of  his
family.   This  direction  applies  both  to  the  appellant  and   to   the
respondent.  Failure to comply with this direction could  lead  to  contempt
of court proceedings.
