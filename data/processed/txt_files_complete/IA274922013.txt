                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction and Background

 1. The Appellant appeals against a determination of Judge  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Kelly promulgated on 15th January 2014.

 2. The Appellant is a female citizen of India born 29th  August  1985  who
    entered the United Kingdom on 20th June 2011.  She had leave to  remain
    as a student until 11th June 2012.

 3. The Appellant claimed that she submitted  an  application  for  further
    leave to remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant on 9th June 2012,
    before her leave expired.

 4. The Respondent  refused  the  application  on  8th  January  2013  with
    reference to paragraph 245ZX(m) which states that an applicant must not
    be in the UK in breach of immigration laws except that  any  period  of
    overstaying for a period of 28 days or less will be  disregarded.   The
    Respondent  contended  that  the  Appellant  had  not   submitted   her
    application for leave to remain until 14th August 2012.  This was  more
    than 28 days after her previous leave expired.

 5. The  application  was  also  refused  under  paragraph  245ZX(d)  which
    requires that an applicant must be awarded a minimum of 10 points under
    Appendix C which relates to maintenance.  The Respondent contended that
    the Appellant was required to show that she was in possession of ï¿½7,200
    for a consecutive 28 day period, and in accordance with paragraph 1A(h)
    of Appendix C, the end of the 28 day period would be taken as the  date
    of the closing balance on the most recent of  the  specified  documents
    submitted, and the date must be no earlier than 31 days before the date
    of application.  The closing date on the  Appellant's  bank  statements
    was 28th May 2012 which was more than 31 days prior to the  application
    and therefore the Respondent was unable to take  those  documents  into
    account.

 6. The Respondent contended that there was no right of appeal against  the
    decision because the Appellant did not have leave  when  she  made  her
    application on 14th August 2012, as her leave had expired on 11th  June
    2012.

 7. Nevertheless  the  Appellant  lodged  an  appeal  with  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  The Duty Judge at the Tribunal Support Centre in  Leicester,
    issued directions to the Appellant's solicitors who were acting at that
    time, to provide proof that the application had been  lodged  prior  to
    the expiry of the Appellant's leave, as this was contended on behalf of
    the Appellant.  Those solicitors, who no longer act for the  Appellant,
    provided a receipt indicating that a document had been  posted  to  the
    Respondent on 9th June 2012.   The  appeal  was  therefore  listed  for
    hearing.

 8. The Appellant had requested that her appeal be determined on the papers
    and Judge Kelly (the judge) determined the appeal on the papers on 24th
    December 2013.  The judge found that there was no valid  appeal  before
    the Tribunal as the Appellant did not have  leave  when  she  made  her
    application, and the judge rejected various arguments  put  forward  by
    the Appellant's previous solicitors to the effect that the Respondent's
    decision was in fact a decision made  under  section  82(2)(g)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act, in other words a decision that
    the Appellant was to be removed from the United Kingdom, and  that  the
    Appellant was entitled to an in-country right of appeal because she was
    making a human rights claim.

 9. The Appellant applied for permission to appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal,
    acting in person without  legal  representation.   She  contended  that
    there was a preliminary  issue  to  be  decided  with  regards  to  the
    validity of the appeal, and the judge had not considered the bundle  of
    documents that was before him.

10. Permission to appeal was initially refused but subsequently granted  by
    Upper Tribunal Judge Coker in the following terms;

    1.   The FTT Judge held in a precise determination  that  the  decision
         the Appellant sought to appeal was not an  appealable  decision  as
         defined by section 82 of the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum
         Act 2002.  The grounds assert that there was a failure  to  examine
         documents in reaching that decision.
    2.   The documents include a  copy  Royal  Mail  postage  slip  in  the
         Respondent's bundle dated 14/08/2012  and  a  copy  postal  receipt
         showing  a  date  of  posting  as  09/06/2012  in  the  Appellant's
         documents.  There is a note on the file to  the  effect  "Allow  to
         proceed - necessary evidence now provided 30.9.13".
    3.   It appears that the FTT Judge may have overlooked these  documents
         although it is unclear which was relied upon.

11. Following the grant of permission  the  Respondent  lodged  a  response
    pursuant to rule 24 of The Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 contending that the  First-tier  Tribunal  determination  did  not
    disclose an error of law as the Appellant did not have leave to  remain
    when she made her application for further leave, and therefore did  not
    have a right of appeal.

The Upper Tribunal Hearing

12. The Appellant attended the hearing.  I established that  there  was  no
    need  for  an  interpreter.   The  Appellant  was  represented  by   Mr
    Wainwright of Counsel on a direct access basis.

Error of Law

13. Mr Wainwright submitted that the judge had erred in law by  failing  to
    consider and make any reference to the postal receipt  dated  9th  June
    2012 which indicated  that  some  documents  had  been  posted  to  the
    Respondent on 9th June 2012.  The postal receipt indicated that a large
    letter had been posted from a post office in  Church  Street,  Enfield,
    Middlesex on 9th June 2012, and Mr Wainwright contended  that  as  this
    receipt had been submitted by the Appellant's previous  solicitors,  it
    indicated that it was the Appellant's application that had been  posted
    on that date and therefore it had been posted before her leave expired.

14. Mr Smart accepted that the judge  had  erred  in  not  considering  the
    evidence of posting but contended that there was no material  error  of
    law as the decision made by the  Respondent  was  a  refusal  to  grant
    leave, and this was not an Immigration Decision that carried a right of
    appeal.   Mr  Smart  relied  upon  Singh  (no  Immigration  Decision  -
    jurisdiction) [2013] UKUT 00440 (IAC).

15. Having considered submissions by both representatives, I  decided  that
    the judge had erred by not considering or making any reference  to  the
    evidence provided by the Appellant's previous solicitors, to the effect
    that the application had been lodged in time.   Paragraph  34G  of  the
    Immigration Rules provides that if an application is posted,  then  the
    date that the application is made, is the date of posting.

16. There was evidence submitted on  behalf  of  the  Appellant,  that  the
    application had been posted on 9th June 2012, and if that was  correct,
    the application would have been made in time, and the  Appellant  would
    have had a right of appeal against the Respondent's  decision,  as  the
    decision would have been refusal to vary leave so  that  the  Appellant
    had no leave to remain, which is a  decision  of  a  type  set  out  in
    section 82(2)(d) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

17. As this evidence had been submitted, it should, in my view,  have  been
    considered and findings made upon it.  I  found  that  Singh  could  be
    distinguished on the facts.

18. I therefore decided that the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  must
    be set aside and re-made.

19. Both representatives agreed that it would  be  appropriate  for  me  to
    consider  the  validity  of  the  appeal,  and  if  I  found  that  the
    application had been made in time, before the expiry of the Appellant's
    leave, then it would be appropriate to find the  Respondent's  decision
    not  in  accordance  with  the  law,  and  the  decision  would  remain
    outstanding before the Respondent.  Both representatives indicated that
    they were ready  to  proceed  and  there  was  no  application  for  an
    adjournment.

Re-Making the Decision

20. Mr Wainwright indicated that he intended to call the Appellant to  give
    evidence limited to the issue of when  the  application  for  leave  to
    remain was submitted.

The Appellant's Evidence

21. The Appellant had not  made  a  witness  statement  and  was  therefore
    questioned firstly by Mr Wainwright, and thereafter  cross-examined  by
    Mr Smart.  I have recorded all questions and answers in  my  Record  of
    Proceedings but will set out here only a summary of the evidence.

22. In answering questions put by Mr Wainwright the Appellant said that she
    had instructed solicitors in  London  to  submit  her  application  for
    further leave to remain.  These solicitors had been recommended so  she
    decided to use them, even though she lived in Leicester.

23. The Appellant visited the offices of her  solicitors  on  a  number  of
    occasions and submitted various documents and completed an  application
    form with the assistance of her solicitors.

24. The Appellant was shown the postal receipt dated 9th June  2012,  which
    shows that a large letter was submitted from a post office in  Enfield.
    She said that she had seen this receipt before and  she  believed  this
    was towards the end of September 2012 when she asked her solicitors for
    information as to the progress of her application.  She was  told  that
    her application had been submitted in time and shown the postal receipt
    as evidence of this.

25. In answering questions put by Mr  Smart  the  Appellant  described  the
    location of her previous solicitors' office and confirmed that she  had
    left the application with them to post.   The  Appellant  was  shown  a
    letter dated 9th June 2012 addressed  to  the  Respondent's  office  in
    Durham, which her previous solicitors had submitted and which  referred
    to Article 8 of the 1950 European Convention on Human Rights.  She said
    that she had not been at her previous solicitors' office on  that  date
    and she had not sent  that  letter  and  her  previous  solicitors  had
    prepared it in her name.

The Respondent's Submissions

26. Mr  Smart  pointed  out  that  the  Respondent's  bundle  of  documents
    contained a copy of the envelope in  which  the  application  had  been
    submitted, which showed that the application was posted on 14th  August
    2012.  I was asked to note that the application was  date  stamped  8th
    and 15th  August  2012.   Mr  Smart  stated  that  he  could  offer  no
    explanation for the 8th August 2012 date stamp,  but  the  15th  August
    2012 date stamp indicated that the application  had  been  received  on
    that date, having been posted on 14th August 2012.

27. It was accepted, in relation to the postal receipt dated 9th June 2012,
    that the postcode on that receipt was the  Respondent's  department  in
    Durham, and that post office Track and Trace  indicated  that  whatever
    letter had been posted on 9th June 2012 had been delivered on 20th June
    2012.

28. Mr Smart's submission was that it had not been proved that it  was  the
    Appellant's application for further leave to remain that was posted  on
    9th June 2012.  I was asked to conclude that  the  solicitors  had  not
    posted the application on that date, and to note that the bar  code  on
    the envelope received by the Respondent, was different to the bar  code
    on the receipt dated 9th June 2012.  As it was not established that the
    Appellant's application had been made before her leave expired,  I  was
    asked to conclude that there was no valid appeal.

The Appellant's Submissions

29. Mr Wainwright asked that I accept the Appellant's  evidence,  and  that
    her previous solicitors had submitted the postal receipt dated 9th June
    2012 as evidence that the application had been posted.   Mr  Wainwright
    accepted that the burden of proof was on the Appellant  to  prove  that
    her application was lodged in time,  and  asked  that  I  make  such  a
    finding, based upon the Appellant's evidence.

30. At the conclusion of oral submissions I reserved my decision.



My Conclusions and Reasons

31. I accept  that  the  Appellant  instructed  solicitors  to  submit  her
    application for further leave to remain and I accept that  she  visited
    their office on more than one occasion.  The Appellant accepts,  and  I
    find as a fact that she did not personally post her application.

32. I accept that the receipt dated 9th June 2012 shows that a large letter
    was posted to the Respondent's department in Durham, and  that  it  was
    delivered on 20th June 2012.

33. I note the  absence  of  any  further  evidence  from  the  Appellant's
    previous solicitors,  and  there  is  no  explanation  as  to  why  the
    application was posted from a post office in  Enfield,  and  that  post
    office is 13.4 miles from the solicitors' office.

34. I accept  that  the  Respondent's  bundle,  which  is  not  indexed  or
    paginated, includes a copy of the envelope received by the  Respondent,
    containing the Appellant's application.  That envelope  indicates  that
    it was posted on  14th  August  2012.   The  Royal  Mail  bar  code  is
    different from the bar code on the postal receipt dated 9th June  2012.
    I conclude that this indicates that the letter posted on 9th June  2012
    was not the same letter received by the Respondent on 14th August 2012.

35. I therefore conclude that the Appellant has not proved that the  letter
    posted on 9th June 2012, contained her application for further leave to
    remain.  The evidence indicates that the  Appellant's  application  was
    not posted until 14th August 2012.

36. Therefore the Appellant's application was made after her leave  expired
    on 11th June 2012.  This means that the Respondent's decision is not an
    Immigration Decision which generates a right of appeal as it is  not  a
    decision contained within section 82 of  the  Nationality,  Immigration
    and Asylum Act 2002.  The appeal entered by the Appellant is, for  that
    reason, invalid and the Tribunal has no jurisdiction  to  consider  the
    appeal.

Decision

The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contained an error of  law  and
was set aside.

I substitute a fresh decision.  There is no valid appeal.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal made no anonymity  direction.   There  has  been  no
request for anonymity and the Upper Tribunal makes no anonymity order.
