Representation:

For the Appellant:      The sponsors: Mr and Mrs Akinwale
For the Respondent:     Mr S Kotas, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. The appellant is a Nigeria national born on 2 May 1998 who seeks to  join
her paternal uncle and his family for  settlement.  She  is  an  orphan,  it
being accepted that her father passed away on 29 June 2010  and  her  mother
on 3 February 2015. The application for entry clearance was made on 22  July
2015 and refused on 18 September 2015 under  paragraph  297  (f)(i)  of  the
Immigration Rules. An appeal was lodged under s.82(1) of  the  2002  Act  on
article 8 grounds and was dismissed by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Malcolm
following a hearing at Hatton Cross on 28 April 2017. Permission  to  appeal
was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Reeds  on  14  September  2017  and  the
matter came before me at Field House on 23  November  2017.  The  First-tier
Tribunal's decision was set aside for the reasons given in my  determination
of 8 December 2017 and the matter came to me on 15  February  2018  for  the
decision to be re-made.

The Hearing

2. The sponsor and his wife attended the hearing. Both  gave  oral  evidence
and both made submissions. Mr Akinwale gave  evidence  first.  He  submitted
the  originals  of  the  appellant's  birth  certificate   and   the   death
certificates of her parents. These were seen by  myself  and  Mr  Kotas  and
returned to him.

3. The sponsor confirmed his personal details and stated that the  appellant
was his late brother's only child. His brother had been a draftsman and  had
lived with his wife, a  former  teacher,  and  the  appellant  in  a  rented
apartment in Lagos. The sponsor visited Nigeria regularly and sometimes  his
brother helped him on projects. The sponsor helped them financially;  paying
towards their accommodation costs and school fees. The sponsor  stated  that
when his brother fell ill, he helped him with medical bills. Eventually  his
brother's wife found it difficult to cope with his illness and  he  went  to
live with their father until his death in June 2010. His  parents  were  now
both deceased.

4. The appellant and her mother moved to a smaller property and  the  latter
worked as a petty trader. The sponsor helped her with the money to  purchase
a pepper grinder. She had stopped  teaching.  The  sponsor  visited  Nigeria
after his brother's death and then again for his father's funeral  in  early
2016. His wife accompanied him and they were away for 2 - 2  1/2  weeks.  He
stated that the appellant was very saddened and embittered  after  she  lost
both her parents. She had been studying at that time but  had  since  ceased
her studies. Following the death of her mother, she initially stayed with  a
distant relative of her mother who maltreated her.  The  sponsor  then  made
arrangements with the pastor and the appellant  would  stay  with  different
church going families for weeks at a time. She also spent time  living  with
different friends.

5. The sponsor said that the appellant was uncommunicative and  bitter  when
he saw her during his visits. He also had an arrangement  whereby  he  would
call a friend who would then find the appellant and arrange for  her  to  be
present when the sponsor called. The sponsor then purchased a  mobile  phone
for the appellant and they continued contact in that way.

6. The sponsor recalled that he had visited Nigeria  in  December  2010.  He
then went for his father-in-law's burial in April 2014 but he was  not  sure
of the date. His last visit was  in  January  2016  following  his  father's
death.

7. The sponsor said that he texted and "Whatsapped" the  appellant  but  she
was not very responsive. His wife kept in touch with her too  and  was  also
in  touch  with  the  pastor.  He  said  that  the   arrangement   for   her
accommodation was meant to be temporary until she could join them  here.  He
paid for her accommodation  and  used  to  pay  her  school  fees  when  she
studied. The appellant was unhappy and dejected. Sexual  advances  had  been
made towards her and she had been beaten up. She  was  vulnerable  following
the loss of her parents. She would be looked after here and  would  be  able
to receive counselling. He felt unhappy because he could  not  do  what  was
right for her.

8. In cross examination, the sponsor stated that  he  had  been  to  Nigeria
after his brother's death, after the passing of his father-in-law and  after
his own father's death. Although his brother  and  his  brother's  wife  had
been working at the time of his brother's  death,  the  sponsor  had  helped
them financially as they could not manage. His step family  had  sorted  out
the funeral. The appellant and her mother had not moved in with  his  father
after his brother's death as they were not on good  terms.  His  father  had
several wives and was living with one of them who did not want  them  there.
The sponsor's mother was the first wife.

9. The sponsor said that his sister-in-law had  stopped  teaching  when  she
lost her job. She had since been  involved  in  petty  trading  and  he  had
assisted her financially. There was no formal arrangement but  he  paid  the
rent when it was due and he paid for the machine she bought  for  her  work.
She had suffered from high blood pressure and she died in 2015. Some of  her
extended family members sorted out the  funeral.  The  appellant  had  tried
living with them but they were not good to her.

10. The sponsor did not know why the pastor had not mentioned the fact  that
the appellant had lived with these relatives or with friends.

11. The sponsor was asked why there was  no  reference  to  sexual  advances
having been made in his witness statement. He said that  he  mentioned  this
once she had told him about it. The fact that she had only  disclosed  these
events recently did not mean that they had not happened. It was put  to  the
sponsor that he should be expected to know who made the  advances.  He  said
he was more concerned that they did not continue and that he  could  not  go
around accusing the wrong families. He  explained  that  the  appellant  had
been reluctant to disclose this  information.  She  had  been  reserved  and
withdrawn. He explained that she had told  the  pastor  that  she  had  been
sleeping rough. She did not always take his calls. He was unable to  specify
where she was because she stayed a week with one  family  and  then  a  week
with another. The relationship had deteriorated between them.

12. The sponsor said that the appellant completed school in 2015.  She  then
took a basic skills computing course which she did  not  complete.  She  had
stopped studying and stopped going to church. When they  spoke  last  month,
she had asked when he was coming for her.

13. The sponsor was  asked  whether  he  was  exaggerating  the  appellant's
problems. He denied this. He said he needed her  here  to  look  after  her.
Both he and his wife  worked  and  could  afford  to  support  her.  It  was
difficult to keep in regular contact the way things were.

14. The sponsor said he had only the one brother who had died. He  had  step
sisters. His wife had siblings in the UK. Her father  had  passed  away  and
her elderly mother lived in Nigeria. It was not possible for  the  appellant
to live with her because she was old.  He  denied  that  the  appellant  was
living with her. That completed cross examination.

15. In response to my questions,  the  sponsor  said  that  the  appellant's
friends were also from church going families. He  said  that  he  found  out
about the sexual advances just before the last hearing.  He  said  his  wife
had arranged for the appellant's statement.

16. Mrs Akinwale gave evidence next. She confirmed her address and the  fact
that the appellant's parents  were  both  dead.  She  said  the  appellant's
father had a stroke. The appellant's mother  had  lost  consciousness  on  a
Sunday and was dead by Thursday. She said they had  called  the  pastor  and
made arrangements for the appellant's accommodation.  He  had  arranged  for
her to live with various families as no one family could  manage  it  for  a
long time. She said at first it  seemed  to  work  but  then  the  appellant
complained that she was being treated as a servant. Last year she told  them
that she had suffered sexual advances. She had been  reluctant  to  complain
about that before, for fear of losing her accommodation.  They  then  called
the pastor and he admitted that she had told him too. They were trying  hard
to get the appellant here to safety.

17. Mrs Akinwale said she had been to Nigeria  in  2013  and  in  2016.  Her
father had died in 2012 but was buried immediately as he was a  Muslim.  She
and the sponsor had visited the following year for the first anniversary  of
his death. They had seen the appellant and  her  mother  on  that  occasion.
They saw the appellant again in  2016  when  they  went  for  the  sponsor's
father's funeral. Her situation was difficult. She  was  being  passed  from
family to family. She had been studying then but no longer was.  She  ceased
her studies last year because  she  felt  frustrated  and  dejected  by  her
situation. Mrs Akinwale said they sent clothes to  the  appellant  and  both
she and her husband sent money by bank  transfer.  She  explained  that  she
asked the appellant to prepare and send a statement and that she also  asked
the pastor to write one. The statements were sent by DHL.

18. Mrs Akinwale said that she was in touch with the appellant once  a  week
or a fortnight. Her husband also made contact with her.  She  said  she  was
concerned for the appellant who was being used as a servant. She was not  in
a safe environment. She was a young girl  with  no  support  and  was  taken
advantage of. She said she and  the  sponsor  were  family  and  willing  to
support her.

19. Mrs Akinwale stated that her mother lived in a town some  distance  from
Lagos. She was diabetic. The appellant could not live with her  because  she
was not from her side of the family and, in any case, it would be  a  strain
on her mother.

20. In response to  Mr  Kotas'  questions,  Mrs  Akinwale  stated  that  the
appellant's mother had been a teacher but lost her job. She had then  worked
as a petty trader. The sponsor had helped her buy  a  machine  for  grinding
pepper.

21. She stated that the  appellant  may  well  have  gone  to  live  with  a
relative or friend of her mother after the latter's death. The sponsor  knew
more about that as he was more involved  at  the  time.  She  accepted  that
there was no mention of  that  in  her  statement  but  explained  that  was
because an up to date picture had been sought. She said they  had  not  been
to visit more because it was expensive to travel.  She  said  that  her  own
mother lived in Ijebu but also  visited  Lagos.  It  was  not  her  mother's
responsibility to look after the appellant; she  was  not  a  relative.  She
stated that the appellant had only recently disclosed information about  all
her problems. The pastor had referred to "undesirable  experiences"  in  his
statement. The pastor could not take her in as he could  not  afford  to  do
so. She said that in October 2017 the appellant had run  away  and  it  took
two days to find her. She had last studied computing in May  or  June  2017.
Mrs Akinwale had sisters in the UK and brothers in  Nigeria.  The  appellant
could not live with them because she was not their  relative  and  they  had
their own responsibilities.

22. That completed the oral evidence. I then heard  submissions.   Mr  Kotas
submitted that the case turned on credibility and  there  had  been  serious
divergences from the previous evidence. There had been no suggestion  before
the First-tier Tribunal Judge of any  ill  treatment  or  concern  over  the
appellant's welfare. This was an embellishment. Had the  appellant  felt  at
risk, she would have said so earlier. The sponsor could not recall when  the
appellant had been sleeping rough. There were discrepancies  over  whom  the
appellant lived with, whether with friends or  with  church  goers.  It  was
strange  that  all  these  events  were  not  mentioned  in  the   sponsor's
statement. The pastor did not mention that the appellant lived with  friends
or a relative;  that  was  an  astonishing  omission.  The  letter  was  not
addressed to anyone. The appellant's statement was  undated.  The  sponsor's
wife's mother was a relative and the appellant could go and live  with  her.
The case at its highest was that the appellant  missed  her  parents.  There
was no reason to find that she had suffered  abuse  or  ill  treatment.  The
sponsors never went to visit the appellant. That was indicative of the  fact
that she was being cared for by others. They  had  been  on  other  holidays
which undermined the claim that they could not afford to travel to  Nigeria.
The requirements of paragraph 297 had not been met. The threshold was  high.
Reliance was placed on Mundeba [2013] UKUT 99. The claim of  abuse  had  not
been made out and there were no other  compelling  circumstances.  Her  best
interests would therefore be to  stay  in  Nigeria.  The  appeal  should  be
dismissed.

23. Mrs Akinwale then made her submissions. She relied  on  the  appellant's
statement  and  its  contents  and  she  submitted  that  these   were   not
embellishments. They  had  provided  evidence  as  accurately  as  possible,
bearing in mind that some events occurred several years ago. They  had  only
been made aware of the abuse last year. They had a mortgage  and  their  own
children to support and a ticket to Nigeria cost �650-�700. They  were  also
supporting the appellant. She would not be in a strange environment here  as
they shared the same cultural background. The pastor was not  familiar  with
legal  statements  and  had  simply  written  out  his  own   account.   The
appellant's best interests had not been considered. She  required  love  and
support. It was not tenable for the present arrangements to  continue.   The
appellant was the sponsor's responsibility and  not  the  responsibility  of
his in-laws.

24. I then heard from Mr Akinwale. He  sought  to  differentiate  this  case
from the facts in Mundeba.  He  stated  that  he  was  responsible  for  the
appellant and had been caring for her even before her  parents'  demise.  He
was British born and had not come here to  claim  asylum.  He  was  able  to
provide support and was  not  dependent  upon  the  state.  The  appellant's
living conditions were untenable. He could not shift responsibility for  her
to his in-laws. This was his duty towards her and to his brother.

25. That completed the submissions. At the  conclusion  of  the  hearing,  I
reserved my determination which I now give.

Discussion and Findings

26. In  reaching  my  findings,  I  have  taken  careful  note  of  all  the
submissions and the evidence, whether or not specifically referred to in  my
determination. I bear in mind that it is for the appellant to make  out  her
case on the balance of probabilities and that I  may  take  account  of  the
human rights claim  as  at  the  date  of  hearing.  The  appeal  is  to  be
considered under article 8. As part of my consideration, I have  had  regard
to paragraph 297 of the Immigration Rules as the potential  to  satisfy  the
rules impacts upon the proportionality  of  the  decision  to  refuse  entry
clearance. It is, therefore, a weighty,  though  not  determinative,  factor
when deciding whether such refusal is proportionate to  the  legitimate  aim
of enforcing immigration control. I have also  had  regard  to  s.117C  when
undertaking the proportionality assessment.

27. Paragraph 297 provides:

The requirements to be met by a person seeking  indefinite  leave  to  enter
the United Kingdom as the child of a parent, parents or a  relative  present
and settled or being admitted for settlement in the United Kingdom are  that
he:
(i) is seeking leave to enter to accompany or join a parent,  parents  or  a
relative in one of the following circumstances:
.....
(f) one parent or a relative is present and settled in  the  United  Kingdom
or being admitted on the same occasion for settlement and there are  serious
and compelling family or other considerations which make  exclusion  of  the
child undesirable and suitable arrangements have been made for  the  child's
care; and
(ii) is under the age of 18; and
(iii) is not leading an independent life, is unmarried and is  not  a  civil
partner, and has not formed an independent family unit; and
(iv) can, and will, be accommodated adequately by  the  parent,  parents  or
relative the child is seeking to join without recourse to  public  funds  in
accommodation which the parent, parents or relative the child is seeking  to
join, own or occupy exclusively; and
(v) can, and will, be maintained  adequately  by  the  parent,  parents,  or
relative the child is seeking to join, without  recourse  to  public  funds;
and
(vi) holds a  valid  United  Kingdom  entry  clearance  for  entry  in  this
capacity; and
(vii) does not fall for refusal under the general grounds for refusal.

28. It is no longer  disputed  that  the  appellant  is  the  niece  of  the
sponsor, that she was born on the date claimed  and  that  her  parents  are
both deceased. There was also no  issue  taken  by  the  respondent  on  the
following matters:  that the sponsor is a British national  and  settled  in
the UK with his wife and their three children, that the appellant was  under
the age of 18 when she made the application, that she is unmarried and  does
not lead an independent life, that she can and will be  adequate  maintained
and accommodated by the sponsor, that suitable arrangements have  been  made
for her care here and that  she  does  not  meet  the  general  grounds  for
refusal.  The only provision that was disputed  was  (i)(f):  whether  there
are serious  and  compelling  family  or  other  considerations  which  make
exclusion undesirable. As far as  article  8  is  concerned,  there  was  no
submission by the respondent that the appellant  and  the  sponsors  do  not
enjoy family life. The focus of the respondent's case was that  the  refusal
was a proportionate interference with her family/private life.

29. I have also had regard to the respondent's guidance to  entry  clearance
officers  on  the  issue  of  what  constitutes   serious   and   compelling
circumstances and on the approach to be  taken  in  such  applications.  The
relevant part of that guidance (at Chapter 8 Section 5A) states:

"Section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration  Act  2009  requires
the UK Border Agency to carry out its  existing  functions  in  a  way  that
takes into account  the  need  to  safeguard  and  promote  the  welfare  of
children in the UK. It does  not  impose  any  new  functions,  or  override
existing functions. Officers must not apply the  actions  set  out  in  this
instruction either to children or to those with children without having  due
regard to Section 55.

The UK Border Agency instruction  'Arrangements  to  Safeguard  and  Promote
Children's Welfare in the United Kingdom Border Agency'  sets  out  the  key
principles to take into account in  all  Agency  activities.  Our  statutory
duty to children includes the need to demonstrate:
. Fair treatment which  meets  the  same  standard  a  British  child  would
receive; . The child's interests being made  a  primary,  although  not  the
only consideration;
. No discrimination of any kind; ...
. Identification of those that might be at risk from harm.

This paragraph relates to  the  considerations  referred  to  in  Paragraphs
297(i)(f)... of the Immigration Rules. The objective of  this  provision  is
to allow a child to join a parent or relative in  this  country  only  where
that child could not be adequately cared for by his parents or relatives  in
his own country. It has never been the intention of the Rules that  a  child
should be admitted here due to the wish of  or  for  the  benefit  of  other
relatives in this country. This approach is  entirely  consistent  with  the
internationally accepted principle that a child should  first  and  foremost
be cared for by his natural parent(s) or, if this is not  possible,  by  his
natural relatives in the country in which he lives. Only  if  the  parent(s)
or relative(s) in his own country cannot care for him  should  consideration
be given to him joining relatives in another country...

If the sponsor is  not  a  parent  but  another  relative,  eg  an  aunt  or
grandparent, the factors which are to  be  considered  relate  only  to  the
child and the circumstances in which he lives or lived prior  to  travelling
here. These circumstances should  be  exceptional  in  comparison  with  the
ordinary circumstances of other children in his home country. It would  not,
for instance, be sufficient to show he would be better  off  here  by  being
able to attend a state school. The circumstances relating  to  the  sponsors
here (eg. the fact that they are elderly or infirm and need caring for)  are
not to be taken into account".

30. Mr Kotas submitted that the  case  turned  on  credibility  issues;  the
credibility of the appellant and her sponsors. I agree. Although  he  sought
to argue that the sponsors had embellished  and  exaggerated  the  claim,  I
found them to be straightforward and honest witnesses, trying to assist  the
court to the best of  their  abilities.  I  accept  their  evidence  in  its
entirety and I also accept the evidence of the  appellant  as  contained  in
her witness statement as a true account of the difficulties  she  has  faced
since the tragic loss of both her parents. The pastor  has  been  consistent
in his description of the appellant's difficulties and  I  accept  that  his
reference to "undesirable experiences" refers to the  sexual  attention  the
appellant has received.

31. The appellant was 17 when she made her entry clearance application  just
a few months after the death of her mother which left her  orphaned  at  the
age of 16. I must have regard to her age as it was when the application  was
made. I accept the evidence that her life had already been  difficult  since
the earlier passing of her father when she was 12 but, as she  said  in  her
statement, she still had her mother at that stage. After her mother's  death
her life became unsettled and harsh. She was temporarily housed  by  various
individuals and families arranged by the church and forced to  change  homes
after a few weeks or months. This is confirmed by the oral evidence  of  the
sponsors and the written evidence from the appellant and the pastor.  I  see
nothing sinister in the pastor's failure  to  address  his  statement  to  a
particular person nor do I read anything into  the  fact  that  he  did  not
refer to the appellant living with a distant relative immediately after  her
mother's death or with friends at various points in time. I accept  that  he
was presenting an overall picture and, given that  the  appellant's  friends
were also members of church going  families,  there  is  nothing  discrepant
between his evidence and hers. I note from the pastor's October 2015  letter
that by that time, she had already lived in ten different households.

32. The guidance states that an appellant's circumstances must  be  compared
to the ordinary circumstances of other children in the  country  of  origin.
Mr Kotas submitted that many children could  be  orphaned  but  he  did  not
refer me to any documentary evidence to  support  that  submission.  In  any
event, losing both parents at a tender age and moving around from pillar  to
post is not what I would consider to be an ordinary  circumstance  faced  by
other Nigerian children.

33. I fully accept that the  appellant  felt  vulnerable  and  reluctant  to
disclose the personal and very unpleasant and unwelcome  advances  that  she
experienced from adult males as well as  the  physical  ill  treatment  from
others from the very beginning of her itinerant lifestyle. She  is  a  young
girl with no family support in Nigeria  and  I  accept  that  she  has  felt
despondent, embittered and vulnerable. I also accept that a genuine fear  of
losing whatever  shelter  she  had  prevented  her  from  revealing  to  the
sponsors the abuse she had suffered.  I  find  that  is  why  they  made  no
reference to the ill treatment earlier on in  these  proceedings.  I  reject
the submission that this was a late attempt to embellish the claim. I  heard
the sponsors give evidence twice; at the error of law hearing and  again  at
the most recent hearing and, on both occasions, I  was  impressed  by  their
sincerity and  integrity.  I  find  that  the  evidence  of  abuse  and  ill
treatment  pertains  to  circumstances  appertaining  at  the  date  of  the
decision and that it is ongoing. I accept that the appellant cannot be  sent
to live with the sponsor's mother-in-law  or  brother-in-law.  There  is  no
evidence that they have even met the appellant and they certainly cannot  be
expected to take on the responsibility for a young girl who is not  part  of
their family. As confirmed by Mundeba (s.55 and paragraph 297(i)(f))  [2013]
UKUT 88 (IAC) relied on by the respondent and by Upper Tribunal Judge  Reeds
who granted permission to appeal, the Tribunal found  that  the  context  of
the rule suggested that the relative in the country of origin must  be  able
to provide suitable care for the child of the sort that a parent  would  (at
paragraph 30). There is no such  person  in  Nigeria.  The  sponsor  is  her
closest living relative and I accept that he and his wife  are  best  placed
to care for her needs. I find there is no relative in Nigeria  who  is  able
to care for  her.  There  is  no  suggestion  by  the  respondent  that  the
appellant is being brought here to meet the needs or to assist the  sponsors
in any way. The application was made solely in her best interests which  are
quite plainly to live in a safe environment with her family.

34. It is confirmed in Mundeba that, although the s.55 duty under  the  2007
Act only applies to children in the UK, "the broader duty explains  why  the
Secretary of State's IDI invites Entry Clearance Officers  to  consider  the
statutory guidance issued under s.55" (head note (ii)). The  Tribunal  found
that:

"Family  considerations  require  an  evaluation  of  the  child's   welfare
including emotional needs. Other considerations come into play  where  there
are other aspects of a child's life that  are  serious  and  compelling  for
example where an applicant is living in an unacceptable social and  economic
environment. The focus needs to be on the circumstances of the child in  the
light of his or her age, social background  and  developmental  history  and
will involve an inquiry as to whether :
(a) there is evidence of neglect or abuse;
(b) there are unmet needs that should be catered for;
(c) there are stable arrangements for the child's physical care.

The assessment involves consideration  as  to  whether  the  combination  of
circumstances are sufficiently serious and compelling to require  admission"
(head note (iv)).

35.   The assessment must of course be fact  sensitive.  No  assessment  was
undertaken by the ECO in his decision. Only the briefest reference  to  s.55
is made in the ECM's review of 23 May 2016. The conclusion there  is  simply
that  "there  are  no  exceptional  circumstances"  but  no  explanation  is
provided for  why  this  view  was  taken  or  of  what  circumstances  were
considered. I accept that the full picture was not,  however,  available  to
the respondent at the  time  of  the  application.  An  examination  of  the
appellant's circumstances as now known does, in my view,  disclose  evidence
of neglect and  abuse,  unmet  emotional  and  physical  needs,  a  lack  of
stability in the arrangements for her care which were only ever designed  as
a temporary measure following the sudden loss of her  mother.   As  a  young
female, she is vulnerable to  preying  males  who  have  attempted  to  take
advantage of her situation. She is living in an unacceptable environment.  I
accept the threshold is a high one and excludes cases where,  without  more,
it is simply the wish of the parties to be together  (Mundeba  at  paragraph
34). This is not, however, a case where  the  application  was  made  solely
because the parties wished to be united. It is far more than that. It  seems
to me that all the circumstances identified constitute sufficiently  serious
and compelling circumstances to  justify  admission  given  the  appellant's
specific background. Unlike in  Mundeba,  this  appellant's  needs  are  not
being met. It follows that I find that the  requirements  of  paragraph  297
have all been met in so far as they relate to the appellant.

36. Any suggestion by the respondent that the appellant had fared all  right
as indicated by her graduation from school, is undermined  by  the  evidence
which demonstrates that the appellant completed her SSC (not GCSEs) in  2014
before the death of her mother. There is no evidence  to  suggest  that  she
successfully completed any course of education since  then  and  I  have  no
reason to doubt the sponsors' evidence that she did not.

37. I consider the guidance set out in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27. There  was  no
submission by  Mr  Kotas  that  family  life  does  not  exist  between  the
appellant and the sponsor and his family and, based on all  the  evidence  I
have seen and heard, I find  that  it  does.  The  sponsor  is  the  closest
relative the appellant has and I accept that he  had  taken  on  a  father's
role in her life and that she has  a  close  relationship,  if  strained  at
times due to the unfortunate circumstances, with him,  his  wife  and  their
children (the appellant's cousins) whom she has  grown  close  to  on  their
visits to Nigeria. I accept that there is also a dependency of an  emotional
and  financial  nature  upon  the  sponsor  and  that  there  was  financial
dependency going back a number of years. I find that the  refusal  of  entry
clearance does interfere with that family life although it is in  accordance
with the law and in pursuance of a legitimate aim.

38. Turning then to the question of proportionality, that being the crux  of
this appeal, I find that  the  decision  to  refuse  entry  clearance  is  a
disproportionate one. I have already set out all my  findings  of  fact  and
those facts which are not contentious. There is family life.  It  cannot  be
enjoyed in Nigeria as the sponsor is a British national by birth and  cannot
be expected to uproot himself, his wife and their three  children  who  have
known no other home to move to Nigeria. The sponsors  have  employment  here
and a mortgage on their home. Their children are settled and  in  education.
Their lives are here. Relocating  to  Nigeria  would  be  unreasonable.  The
applicant can speak English as her statement and  educational  papers  show.
She would not be a burden on the state as she would  be  fully  accommodated
and supported by the  sponsors.  The  fact  that  the  appellant  meets  the
requirements of the Immigration  Rules  impacts  further  on  the  balancing
exercise. It means that the refusal of  entry  clearance  serves  no  public
interest and indeed undermines the appellant's best interests which  I  find
are to be united with the only remaining family she has;  the  sponsor,  his
wife and children.

39. For all these reasons, I conclude that article  8  is  engaged  and  the
appeal succeeds.
