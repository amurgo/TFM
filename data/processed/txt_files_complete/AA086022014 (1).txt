Representation:
For the claimant: Mr A Vaughan, instructed by Duncan Lewis & Co
For the respondent:    Ms A Brocklesby-Weller, Senior Home Office
Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The claimant, RH, date of birth 15.11.96, is a citizen of  Afghanistan.



 2. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Lall promulgated  10.6.15,  allowing  on  all
    grounds the claimant's appeal against the decision of the Secretary  of
    State, dated 7.10.14, to refuse his asylum, humanitarian protection and
    human rights claims.  The Judge heard the appeal on 4.6.15.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Osborne  refused  permission  to  appeal  on
    30.6.15. However,  when  the  application  was  renewed  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, Upper Tribunal Judge Grubb granted permission  to  appeal  on
    18.8.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 7.12.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Lall should be set aside.

 6. The relevant background can be summarised briefly as follows. The claim
    is that the  Taliban  came  to  the  claimant's  village  in  Nangarhar
    Province trying to recruit him. His  father  always  refused,  but  one
    night they returned when he was not there, beat and abducted him to the
    mountains, where he was trained to use a suicide vest.  After  some  20
    days he took the opportunity to escape  and  returned  to  his  family.
    After a few days he was abducted a second time; he believed this was by
    the Taliban, but it appears to have been an agent engaged to  help  him
    flee Afghanistan. In November 2010 he claims to have travelled some 2-3
    months in a single lorry without ever getting out,  until  Kent  Police
    apprehended him on 22.2.11, whereupon he claimed asylum. He  claims  to
    fear return to Afghanistan on the basis that he would be mistreated due
    to his imputed political opinion. He claims that the Taliban will force
    him to become a suicide bomber.

 7. His asylum claim was refused in April 2011, but because of his  age  he
    was granted discretionary leave to remain until 12.4.14. On  8.4.14  he
    submitted an application for further leave to remain. The Secretary  of
    State considered that his renewed application was not a fresh claim, as
    no new issues have been raised since the refusal decision  of  13.4.11,
    the application was again refused.

 8. Judge Lall found the claimant credible and consistent,  accepting  that
    the Taliban abducted him. The judge also  found  that  if  returned  to
    Kabul he would be without family or tribal protection,  rendering  such
    unduly harsh. In the brief �27 the judge relied on the same reasons  to
    find the claimant faced a threat of serious harm on return.  The  judge
    then went straight on to conduct a Razgar Article  8  ECHR  assessment,
    without even mentioning the Rules in relation  to  private  and  family
    life, concluding that the claimant has both a private and  family  life
    with his uncle and family in the UK and "there is  nothing  to  suggest
    that it would be contrary to the public interest to allow  this  appeal
    on this additional ground as well."

 9. The grounds assert that the judge failed to give adequate  reasons  for
    findings on material matter,  and  made  misdirection  in  law.  It  is
    asserted that he  failed  to  provide  adequate  reasons  to  find  the
    appellant's account credible and failed to consider the contention that
    even if taken at its highest the claimant  would  not  be  at  risk  of
    persecution  on  return  due   to   imputed   political   opinion.   No
    consideration  was  given  to  the  availability  of   sufficiency   of
    protection or to internal relocation. There was no consideration of the
    Rules in relation to private and family life before the  judge  engaged
    in  a  freewheeling  Article  8  assessment.  Further,  there  was   no
    substantive consideration of  the  public  interest  considerations  of
    section 117B of the 2002 Act.

10. The judge allowed the  appeal  on  all  grounds,  asylum,  humanitarian
    protect, and under Article 8 ECHR. Allowing the  appeal  on  all  three
    grounds itself is an error of law, as humanitarian protection  is  only
    available for those who are not refugees.

11. However, I find little force in the ground of appeal as to reasons  for
    credibility findings. Ms Brocklesby-Weller  submitted  that  the  judge
    failed to engage with the adoption in the second  refusal  decision  of
    the plausibility issues taken against the claimant in the first refusal
    decision, particularly in relation to his return home after escape  and
    forced recruitment to the Taliban. It is clear from �15 to �18 that the
    judge has  considered  submissions  on  these  issues  before  reaching
    findings and in  particular  that  at  �21  that  his  escape  was  not
    intrinsically  incredible  and  remained  consistent  in  his   various
    accounts.

12. The second ground  submits  that  inadequate  reasons  were  given  for
    finding that the claimant is now at risk of return in  2015,  involving
    considerations of sufficiency of protection and internal relocation. At
    �26 the judge found he would be  returning  without  family  or  tribal
    protection and it would be unduly  harsh  to  require  him  to  do  so,
    stating, "He would be returning, as an escapee would-be suicide  bomber
    from the Taleban, also originating from an insurgency area and  in  the
    absence of any familial or Tribunal protection he would be at real risk
    of persecution because of this." However, the judge failed to  identify
    any identifiable reasons why the claimant would be at risk  on  return,
    or why he would be able to be identified as a would-be  suicide  bomber
    if relocating. Mr  Vaughan  submitted  that  there  is  no  purpose  in
    considering sufficiency of protection as the alleged risk is  from  the
    government, but that was not the finding of the judge.  Had  the  judge
    considered there to be  a  risk  from  the  state  he  would  not  have
    addressed the risk of relocation.

13. In summary, I find that the judge has failed to justify by  any  cogent
    reasons why he would be at risk from the government on  return;  simply
    because he came from an area of insurgency is hardly sufficient. In the
    context of the background evidence of limited forced recruitment by the
    Taliban, as referred to in the refusal decision, the  judge  failed  to
    explain why the claimant would now be at risk  in  the  light  of  that
    material and to address whether the state  could  or  would  provide  a
    sufficiency of protection against any risk to  the  claimant  from  the
    Taliban. Neither is there any sufficient reasoning as to why the  judge
    considered it would be unduly harsh to expect him to relocate. Although
    the judge gave some reasons at �26 for  concluding  that  the  claimant
    could not reasonably be expected to relocate to Kabul, the reasoning is
    entirely inadequate. In the circumstances, I find  this  amounts  to  a
    clear and material error of law.

14. I also find that before embarking on an Article 8  ECHR  assessment  of
    private and family life, the judge failed  to  consider  the  Rules  in
    relation  to  private  and  family  life,  including  Appendix  FM  and
    paragraph 276ADE, and in fact  failed  to  demonstrate  any  compelling
    circumstances  justifying  a  consideration  outside  the  Rules  under
    Article 8 ECHR. Before considering Article 8 family  and  private  life
    outside the Rules, I have to consider whether the  private  and  family
    life circumstances of the  claimant  and  her  family  members  are  so
    compelling and insufficiently recognised in the Rules so as  to  render
    the decision of the Secretary of State unjustifiably  harsh  so  as  to
    require, exceptionally, the appeal to be allowed outside the  Rules  on
    the basis of Article 8 ECHR. In SS (Congo)  [2015]  EWCA  Civ  387  and
    Singh v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 74 the Court of Appeal  held  that  whilst
    there is no threshold or intermediary requirement of arguability before
    a decision maker moves to consider the second  stage  of  consideration
    outside the Rules on the basis of Article 8 ECHR, whether  that  second
    stage is required will depend on  whether  all  the  issues  have  been
    adequately addressed under the Rules. In other words, there is no  need
    to conduct a full separate examination of Article 8 outside  the  Rules
    where in the circumstances of a particular case, all issues  have  been
    addressed in the consideration  under  the  Rules.   Those  cases  also
    identified the test as that of compelling circumstances.

15. It is certainly possible for a judge to conclude there is  family  life
    between the claimant and his uncle's family,  but  I  find  the  Razgar
    assessment and in particular the proportionality assessment was flawed.



16. At the very least, that the claimant could not meet the Rules  was  not
    brought into the  proportionality  balancing  exercise,  rendering  the
    assessment as flawed.

17. It is also clear that  the  treatment  of  section  117B  was  entirely
    inadequate, stating only that the Tribunal has had regard to the public
    interest considerations, without bringing any  of  those  factors  into
    play in the proportionality assessment.

18. In effect, even if an Article 8 ECHR assessment outside the  Rules  was
    justified, the proportionality balancing  exercise  was  deficient  and
    failed to take proper account of relevant  factors  in  favour  of  the
    public interest and removal of the  claimant.  I  find  this  to  be  a
    material error vitiating the assessment and conclusions therefrom, such
    that I have reached the conclusion that the decision cannot  stand  and
    must be set aside to be remade.

19. When a decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside,  section
    12(2) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 requires either
    that the case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  with  directions,
    or it must be remade by the Upper Tribunal. The scheme of the Tribunals
    Court and Enforcement Act 2007 does not assign the function of  primary
    fact finding to the  Upper  Tribunal.  The  errors  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge vitiates all other findings of fact and the  conclusions
    from those facts so that there has not been a  valid  determination  of
    the issues in the appeal.

20. In all the circumstances, I consider  it  appropriate  to  relist  this
    appeal for a fresh hearing in the First-tier Tribunal, I do so  on  the
    basis that this is a  case  which  falls  squarely  within  the  Senior
    President's Practice Statement at paragraph  7.2.  The  effect  of  the
    error has been to deprive the parties of a fair hearing. The nature  or
    extent of any judicial fact finding which is necessary for the decision
    in the appeal to  be  re-made  is  such  that,  having  regard  to  the
    overriding objective in rule 2 to deal with cases  fairly  and  justly,
    including with the avoidance of delay, I find that it is appropriate to
    remit this appeal to the First-tier Tribunal to  determine  the  appeal
    afresh.

Conclusion & Decision:

21. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

                    I set aside the decision.

                    I remit the making of the decision in the appeal  to  be
                    heard afresh in the First-tier Tribunal.

Directions

      1. The appeal is remitted to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  be  heard
         afresh, with no findings of fact preserved.

      2. It may be listed before any First-tier Tribunal Judge, except Judge
         Lall.

      3. The estimated length of hearing is 3 hours.

      4. The claimant must advise within 14 days whether an  interpreter  is
         required and if so in what language.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal made an anonymity order. Given the circumstances,  I  continue  the
anonymity order.

Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee  award.
I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable in this case and thus there can be no fee award.
