Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms Everett, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms Akinbolu, Counsel instructed on behalf of the
respondent


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1.  The  Secretary  of  State  appeals,  with  permission,   against   the
    determination of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Randall) promulgated on
    16 January 2020.  By its decision, the Tribunal allowed the Appellant's
    appeal against the Secretary of State's decision, dated 6  April  2019,
    to refuse his human rights claim in the  context  of  the  decision  to
    revoke his deportation.

 2. For the purposes of this decision, I refer to the  Secretary  of  State
    for the Home Department as the respondent and to MC as  the  appellant,
    reflecting their positions before the First-tier Tribunal. The decision
    concerns the circumstances of a child who I will refer to as "child A".

 3. I make a direction regarding anonymity under Rule 14  of  the  Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal Rules) Rules 2008 as the  proceedings  relate
    to the circumstances of a minor. Unless and until a Tribunal  or  court
    directs otherwise the appellant is granted  anonymity.   No  report  of
    these proceedings shall directly or indirectly identify him or  members
    of his family.  This direction applies both to the appellant and to the
    respondent.  Failure to  comply  with  this  direction  could  lead  to
    contempt of court proceedings.

 4. In the light  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  the  Upper  Tribunal  issued
    directions, inter alia, indicating that it  was  provisionally  of  the
    view that the error of law issue could be determined without a face  to
    face hearing and that this could take place  via  Skype.  Both  parties
    have indicated that they were content for the  hearing  to  proceed  by
    this method. Therefore, the Tribunal listed the hearing to enable  oral
    submissions to be given by each of the parties.

 5. The hearing took place on 9  December  2020,  by  means  of  Skype  for
    Business. which has been consented  to  and  not  objected  to  by  the
    parties. A face to face  hearing  was  not  held  because  it  was  not
    practicable,  and  both  parties  agreed  that  all  issues  could   be
    determined in a remote hearing.  I conducted the hearing from court  at
    Bradford IAC. The advocates attended remotely  via  video  as  did  the
    appellant and his wife. There were no issues regarding  sound,  and  no
    substantial technical problems were encountered during the hearing  and
    I am satisfied both advocates were able to make their respective  cases
    by the chosen means.

 6. I am grateful to Ms Everett  and  Ms  Akinbolu  for  their  clear  oral
    submissions.

Background:

 7. The Appellant is a citizen of Afghanistan. The procedural background is
    set out in the decision of the FtTJ at paragraphs 1.2-1.5.

 8. He spent from November 1999 until 2005 in the United  Kingdom  claiming
    to be an Indian national. He claimed asylum as an Indian national after
    being refused leave to  enter,  and  then  lodge  an  appeal  which  is
    dismissed on 17 April 2001 by IJ Pullig. His  subsequent  human  rights
    claim was considered and refused. He left the UK voluntarily in 2005.

 9. He married his wife in Kabul in 2005. They have three children; and the
    date of the hearing the eldest child was 12 years of age,  and  of  the
    three children was a "qualifying child" by  reason  of  her  length  of
    residence. She and her parents had been in the UK since March 2010  and
    the two younger children were born in the United Kingdom. The appellant
    was also in the United Kingdom from 1999  to  2005  before  he  made  a
    voluntary departure. None of the  appellants  have  ever  been  granted
    leave to remain. The appellant and his family members follow  the  Sikh
    religion.

10. On 13 March 2010 he arrived in the UK with his wife and daughter A.  As
    can be seen from the matters set out above,  all  three  have  been  in
    United Kingdom since that date.

11. Shortly after his arrival he was convicted of immigration  offences  in
    relation to his  family's  arrival  and  was  sentenced  to  18  months
    imprisonment.

12. His deportation appeal was allowed on 13 June 2013 but was only on  the
    basis that the correct removal destination was Afghanistan rather  than
    India.

13. A deportation order was made against the appellant on 17  October  2014
    as a result of his conviction on 1 July 2010 in the Crown Court on  two
    counts of assisting unlawful immigration, and, with  intent,  knowingly
    possessing a false or improperly obtained identity  document  belonging
    to another. The appellant was sentenced to 18 months  imprisonment.  On
    the same day decisions  were  also  made  to  make  deportation  orders
    against  other  family  members  pursuant  to  section  5  (4)  of  the
    Immigration Act 1971. At the same time, their applications  for  asylum
    were also refused.

14.  The  family's  appeals  against  the  refusal  of  asylum  and   their
    deportation  were  dismissed  on  19  February   2015   by   Designated
    Immigration Judge  Woodcraft  (DIJ)  and  they  became  "appeal  rights
    exhausted". They were not removed, and a fresh claim was submitted on 8
    September 2016 which was rejected without  a  right  of  appeal  on  11
    November 2016. However,  on  4  October  2017,  further  submissions/an
    application to revoke the deportation order was made and the refusal of
    which gave rise to the appeal that came before the FtTJ on 2  September
    2019. It is recorded that the appeal was in the name of  the  appellant
    only.

15. The points raised in the fresh submissions are also summarised  in  the
    decision of the FtTJ at paragraph 1.4. I need not set out those issues,
    but they refer to the significant changes that had occurred  since  the
    decision made by DIJ Woodcraft in 2015. The principal change related to
    child A who  had  now  been  resident  in  the  United  Kingdom  for  a
    continuous period of seven years, having arrived in March 2010.

16. The application of 4 October 2017 was originally rejected in a decision
    dated 2 April 2018. On 27 April 2018, the  appellant's  representatives
    issued another pre-action protocol challenging the decision of 2  April
    2018. Following the lodging of judicial review proceedings, the consent
    order was sealed on 8 February 2019 whereby the  respondent  agreed  to
    reconsider the submissions  of  4  August  2016  within  three  months.
    Notwithstanding that timescale, the decision under  appeal  before  the
    FtTJ was served on 6 April 2019, that was dated 29 March 2019.

17. The decision letter  was  summarised  at  paragraph  2  of  the  FtTJ's
    decision.



18. The appellant's immigration history is summarised in decision letter as
    set out above.

19. The respondent considered the present claim which was made on the basis
    that he and his family been resident in the United Kingdom for a
    significant number of years and thus had accumulated in total 12 years
    residence. His extended family, friends and parents were in United
    Kingdom and that he had no family or friends in Afghanistan; his
    relationship with his children as genuine and subsisting and there were
    exceptional circumstances and/or "insurmountable obstacles" to his
    return as an Afghan Sikh in light of the case of TG and others(Afghan
    Sikhs persecuted) Afghanistan CG [2015] UKUT 595. That decision post-
    dated the decision of DIJ Woodcraft.

20. The decision letter noted the principles in Devaseelan and the decision
    of DIJ Woodcraft and quoted extensively from it and concluded that
    there was nothing in the present submissions which caused the
    respondent to go behind those findings. Consideration was given to the
    country guidance decision but it was noted that the appellant was male
    and could financially support himself in Afghanistan (having taken into
    account that he voluntarily returned there to marry in January 2005 and
    remained in five years running a shop) that he could find gainful
    employment and would have help from his family there.

21. Reference is made to the three different claims for asylum made over
    time based on his fear of the Taliban, a land dispute, and his Sikh
    religion; all of which had been dismissed. His account of the land
    dispute was described as a fabrication by IJ Osborne in 2013. His fears
    based on his ethnicity/religion and land dispute were considered and
    dismissed by DIJ Woodcraft (partly on the basis he was found not to be
    credible by IJ Pullig and IJ Osborne), and that at different times he
    claimed to be both Sikh and Hindu.

22. It was acknowledged that there was a risk of discrimination for the
    Hindu and Sikh communities there and consideration was given to whether
    the appellant's children would have access to appropriate education in
    light of that discrimination for Sikh and Hindu children. Reference was
    made to the respondents CPIN.

23. The circumstances of the children were addressed individually. For the
    purposes of this decision, child A was considered but at the date of
    the decision, had not lived in the UK continuously for seven years but
    in any event it would not be unduly harsh are expected to leave United
    Kingdom she had no legal right to be in the UK and would be removed
    with her family. It was considered that her circumstances had not
    changed since the decision of DIJ Woodcraft.

24. For the reasons set out in the decision letter the decision to deport
    was maintained and his protection of human rights claim was refused.

The decision of the FtTJ:

25. The appellant appealed that decision by notice dated 18 April 2019. The
    basis upon which he appealed related to a breach of articles 2, 3 and 8
    of the ECHR and that there were "exceptional circumstances" in that he
    had two children in the UK and that his eldest daughter had lived in
    the UK for a period of nine years.

26. The FtTJ heard evidence from the appellant and his wife and as can be
    seen from the decision had a large amount of objective and subjective
    evidence advanced on behalf of the appellant which included an expert
    report by Mr Foxley, a country expert ( see decision from paragraphs 4-
    10.

27. In a decision promulgated on 16 January 2020 the FtTJ allowed the
    appeal on human rights grounds (Article 8).

28. The FtTJ began his consideration by applying the principles in
    Devaseelan, and the previous findings of the IJ's and in particular the
    decision of DIJ Woodcraft in 2015. For the reasons set out in the
    decision at [16] onwards, there had been a significant number of
    developments since that decision which affected the extent to which
    those findings were the starting point of this judge.

29. The judge took into account that there was now a CG decision (TG and
    others) which post-dated DIJ Woodcraft's decision, there was now an
    expert report prepared in 2019 and that the case law concerning return
    to Kabul was in flux following the decision of the Court of Appeal in
    AS (Afghanistan). There were new UNCHR guidelines in 2018 but also that
    child A had been in the United Kingdom in excess of seven years, having
    arrived in March 2010 which required a different approach under section
    117C (5).

30. Having identified the new issues, the judge stated that following a
    review of the evidence specific to the appellant and his family, he
    concluded that except for the material concerning child A there was
    "very little new material which had not been put before DIJ Woodcraft".
    However, the judge did identify some evidential points.

31. Those points were as follows:

        . Whilst the judge was surprised at the lack of clarity on whether
          the appellant was a Hindu or Sikh, the judge found that both
          suffered in Kabul and little turned on that.
        . His fears based on a land dispute and of the Taleban had already
          been rejected and no new evidence had been provided to depart
          from the early adverse findings.
        . The appellant and his wife emphasised the growing independence of
          their eldest daughter A outside of her education and in her daily
          life. There was evidence from the school which describe the
          impact of forced removal upon her as one of "turmoil", to the
          detriment of emotional well-being and indicating that a voluntary
          departure would require pastoral care.
        . At [17.4] the judge recorded that the appellant stated he would
          not send his daughter to school in Kabul as a result of bullying
          from the majority children and that the Sikh school in Kabul had
          closed.
        . The judge found that he had not been satisfied that the appellant
          had told the truth about the whereabouts of his wife's parents
          and that this damaged the credibility of their claim to have no
          one to assist them in Kabul.
        . At paragraphs [18]-[18.5] the FtTJ summarise the expert report.
          The judge concluded at [23] that there had been new evidence from
          the appellant and more up-to-date objective material and
          developing case law which suggested the possibility of "different
          findings".


32. At [24]-[26] the FtTJ addressed the refugee claim but found that the
    appellant had not established that his individual circumstances as a
    Sikh on return to Kabul would be such that he would face ill-treatment
    amounting to persecution, as opposed to discrimination.


33. The FtTJ also recorded the submissions made on behalf of the appellant
    that persecution of the appellant's wife and children could also amount
    to persecution of the appellant. The judge rejected that at [25].

34. At [26] the FtTJ address the issue of the children and whether their
    return to Kabul replace them at risk of persecution. He focused
    particularly on child A as the eldest girl and "therefore the most
    vulnerable child." The judge noted that the expert found the risk to
    children difficult to assess but had found that they were at risk of
    low-level discrimination and prejudice and stated that they would need
    to exercise care of leaving the house. The judge stated, "I find that
    this is significant". Having taken into account the evidence and in the
    light of the country guidance decision TG and others, which concerned
    the denial of access to secondary education being potentially
    persecutory, depending on the causation, and taking into account the
    oral evidence from A's parents who are strongly in favour of education
    in the UK to secondary level, the judge concluded that whilst there was
    a risk of adverse treatment of A is a Sikh girl, a limitation of her
    freedom of movement, and the likelihood of a denial of access to
    secondary education, the factors even combined with the unquantified
    risk of other more serious ill-treatment as a Sikh girl, were not
    sufficient for the appellant to establish a level of seriousness of
    risk amounting to persecution.


35. At [27]-[28] the FtTJ considered the issue of humanitarian protection
    but did not find that the family were in need of international
    protection by way of humanitarian protection.

36. The assessment made of article 8, and relevant to this appeal is set
    out at paragraphs [29]- [47].

37. The FtTJ considered the circumstances of A who had now lived in the
    country for over 10 years and was now in her second year of secondary
    school. Significant new evidence been provided of her private life and
    the argument centred on "the effect on her private life of his
    deportation, based on the argument that she could not enjoy a private
    life in Kabul".

38. At [31] the FtTJ undertook a "Best interest's assessment of child A" as
    a primary, but not paramount consideration. The judge found that it was
    still in the interests of the two younger children to be with their
    parents, wherever they would be but in the case of child A, there were
    a number of factors that pointed to a different conclusion.

39. The FtTJ stated " I note the evidence of the independent life she has
    developed and is continuing to develop here; her length of residence
    here (nearly 10 years, since the age of two); that she is now the
    second year of secondary school system; the letter of support from the
    school and the reference therein to the turmoil and the need for
    pastoral care to which her forced removal would give rise; her own
    views as expressed in her letter; the poor (if not persecutory)
    prospects to her secondary education and any career in Afghanistan:
    that she doesn't speak Pashto, albeit she can understand some; and the
    conditions to which she would return to in Kabul, especially as they
    impact differentially upon a girl, (soon to be a teenager) who has
    grown up enjoying a much freer life here, including the need to be
    accompanied by male relative and going out. Having considered these
    factors, leaving aside the circumstances of her parents, I conclude
    that it is in her best interests to remain in the UK. I find that the
    issues for A are significant wider than the acquisition of an
    education, even of a secondary education; as indicated above, they
    encompass the severe restrictions that will replace almost all aspects
    of a private life if she is returned to Kabul, as was explained in
    apparent statements, in their oral evidence, and by Mr Foxley's
    report."


40. At [32] the FtTJ reminded himself that the best interests of the child
    may be outweighed by the public interest in deportation and that the
    best interests were not "determinative". The FtTJ went on to state "the
    life that she is described as enjoying in the UK is in very stark
    contrast to what her life will be in Kabul, where it would be highly
    circumscribed developmentally, socially and educationally; indeed Mr
    Foxley states that care must be taken whenever she leaves the home, and
    TG and others refers to the need to be accompanied by a male relative.
    She will have none of the freedoms which is described as having here.
    The adverse effect upon her would be that much greater now she's old
    enough to have experienced those freedoms for herself."

41. At [33] the judge reminded himself that there was a "strong public
    interest in deporting foreign criminals, even those with strong links
    with innocent families here". The reference is made to "great weight
    given to Parliament's view, set out in the rules and statute".

42. There was no dispute and the judge found that the appellant was a
    "foreign criminal", and the starting point was that it was in the
    public interest for to him to be deported. The judge noted that it was
    nearly 10 years since offences were committed and it was accepted by
    the judge that his offences were committed to secure the entry of
    himself and his family to the UK to seek protection and not the gain.
    There was no propensity to reoffend and the sentencing remarks referred
    to him as being "hard-working, basically decent and upright person
    apart what you did here". However he still was sentenced to 18 months
    imprisonment and met the threshold by "some distance". The judge
    regarded that as a serious matter which would have "damaged public
    confidence in immigration control". He also had a poor immigration
    history, involving illegal entry and deception. Thus "considerable
    weight" was given to the decision to deport. At [38] the judge set out
    his reasons for finding why the appellant had not established that
    there were very significant obstacle to his integration to Afghanistan.
    The section 117B factors were addressed at [39]]. At [40] the judge
    took into account that the deportation of foreign criminals in the
    public interest; and the more serious the offence committed by foreign
    law, the greater is the public interest in the deportation of the
    criminal.


43. The FtTJ then turned to considering the issue of undue harshness at
    [41]-[47].

44. After setting out the law and noting that the individual criminality of
    the parent was not a relevant factor when undertaking the section 117C
    (5) assessment, he was still considering the broad public interest in
    deporting foreign criminals. At [44] the judge set out his reasoning as
    to why child A was a "qualifying child" and at [45] made a self-
    direction to the decision of the Supreme Court in KO (Nigeria) and at
    [45] made a self-direction as to the "high threshold "appropriate to
    the "unduly harsh "test.

45. Having made those directions, at [47] the judge set out his conclusions
    on the issue as follows:
             "I have set out and discuss the evidence concerning the
             prospects for A on return, even with her family, in some
             detail above, when considering the position under section 55,
             and whether she is a refugee. Some of the conflicts in the
             objective evidence remain unsolved, and I have of course
             concluded that the evidence is not established that what A
             would face in return is serious enough, or likely enough, for
             me to conclude that, on the lower standard of proof, she has a
             well-founded fear of persecution on return. However, even
             taking into account the hardship necessarily involved in an 11
             year old child being deported with a criminal parent to a
             place she left when she was two, I find that the adverse
             effects on A of her enforced return at this age are
             sufficiently bleak and her life sufficiently circumscribed to
             be aptly described as "unduly harsh". This is not inconsistent
             with my findings on refugee status. Notwithstanding the
             general high-level principle that there is a significant
             public interest in deporting foreign criminals, and
             notwithstanding my other findings, I conclude that the high
             threshold set out in section 117C and section 117D is met in
             respect of the effect of deportation on A...  the public
             interest does not require the family's deportation. For
             completeness, I have also to consider the prospect of A
             remaining here without the risk of family. This would clearly
             be unacceptable for a child of 12."

46. The FtTJ therefore allowed his appeal. Permission to appeal was issued
    on a number of grounds and permission was refused and on 6 March 2020
    permission was granted by UTJ Kebede who stated:


         "the judge's decision is a detailed and lengthy one and, whilst it
         may ultimately be found that the grounds are no more than a
         disagreement with the judge's decision, I grant permission on the
         basis that there is arguable merit in [4] and [5] of the ground in
         regard to the judge's reasoning in concluding that it would be
         unduly harsh for the eldest child to return to Afghanistan with her
         family. The grounds are arguable."

The hearing before the Upper Tribunal:

47. Ms Everett on behalf of the respondent, relied upon the written grounds
    of appeal, and written submissions sent by her colleague  and  dated  1
    June 2020.

48. A Rule 24 response was filed on behalf of the appellant  dated  26  May
    2020 by Ms Akinbolu.

49. I also heard oral submission from the advocates, and I am grateful  for
    their assistance and their clear oral submissions. I intend to consider
    those submission in my assessment of the  issues  and  the  grounds  of
    challenge.

Discussion:

50. There is no dispute as to the  applicable  legal  framework.  The  FtTJ
    summarised the relevant issues at [11] and that the decision to  refuse
    his protection and human rights claim was in the context of refusing to
    revoke a deportation order made in 2014.

51. Thus when a person who is not a British citizen is convicted in the  UK
    of an offence for which he is sentenced to a period of imprisonment  of
    at least 12 months, section 32(5) of the UK Borders Act  2007  requires
    the Secretary of State to make a deportation order in respect  of  that
    person (referred to  in  the  legislation  as  a  "foreign  criminal"),
    subject to section 33.  Section  33  of  the  Act  establishes  certain
    exceptions, one of which is that "removal of the  foreign  criminal  in
    pursuance of the deportation order would breach a  person's  Convention
    rights": see section 33(2)(a).



52. The right protected by article 8 is a qualified right with which
    interference may be justified on the basis of various legitimate aims
    which include the prevention of disorder or crime. The way in which the
    question of justification should be approached where a court or
    Tribunal is required to determine whether a decision made under the
    Immigration Acts breaches article 8 is governed by Part 5A (sections
    117A-117D) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002
    (inserted by amendment in 2014).


53. Section 117B lists certain public interest considerations to which the
    court or Tribunal must have regard in all such cases. These include the
    considerations that:
    "(1) The maintenance of effective immigrations controls is in the
    public interest.
    ?
    (4) Little weight should be given to -
    (a) a private life, or
    (b) a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,
    that is established by a person at a time when the person is in the
    United Kingdom unlawfully.
    (5) Little weight should be given to a private life established by a
    person at a time when the person's immigration status is precarious.
    ?"


54. Section 117C lists additional considerations to which the court or
    Tribunal must have regard in cases involving "foreign criminals"
    (defined in a similar way to the 2007 Act). These considerations are:
    "(1) The deportation of foreign criminals is in the public interest.
    (2) The more serious the offence committed by a foreign criminal, the
    greater is the public interest in deportation of the criminal.
    (3) In the case of a foreign criminal ('C') who has not been sentenced
    to a period of imprisonment of four years or more, the public interest
    requires C's deportation unless Exception 1 or Exception 2 applies.
    (4) Exception 1 applies where - (a) C has been lawfully resident in the
    United Kingdom for most of C's life, (b) C is socially and culturally
    integrated in the United Kingdom, and (c) there would be very
    significant obstacles to C's integration into the country to which C is
    proposed to be deported.
    (5) Exception 2 applies where C has a genuine and subsisting
    relationship with a qualifying partner, or a genuine and subsisting
    parental relationship with a qualifying child, and the effect of C's
    deportation on the partner or child would be unduly harsh.
    (6) In the case of a foreign criminal who has been sentenced to a
    period of imprisonment of at least four years, the public interest
    requires deportation unless there are very compelling circumstances,
    over and above those described in Exceptions 1 and 2.
    (7) The considerations in subsections (1) to (6) are to be taken into
    account where a court or Tribunal is considering a decision to deport a
    foreign criminal only to the extent that the reason for the decision
    was the offence or offences for which the criminal has been convicted."


55. "Foreign criminals" who fall within section 117C(3) because they have
    been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of at least 12 months but
    less than four years have been referred to in the case law as "medium
    offenders" - in contrast to those with a sentence of four years or
    more, who are described as "serious offenders". By reason of his
    sentence, the appellant fell into the former category.


56. Section 117D (1) provides that:


    "Qualifying child" means a person who is under the age of 18 and who-
          a) is a British citizen; or

          b) has lived in the United Kingdom for a continuous period of
             seven years or more.



57. In its application to "qualifying child" within the meaning of section
    117D of the NIAA 2002, section 117C (5) imposes the same two
    requirements as are specified in paragraph 399 (a) (ii) of the
    immigration rules. On the facts of this appeal the focus was on whether
    "it would be unduly harsh" for the child A to live in the country to
    which the person is to be deported. Thus the focus of the FtTJ and that
    of the advocates was on Exception 2 based on the appellant's daughter A
    who was a "qualifying child" by reason of her length of residence in
    the UK. As the appellant had been sentenced to a period of imprisonment
    of more than 12 months but less than 4 years, he would need to show
    that the effect on his child of his deportation would be "unduly
    harsh": s117C(5) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.
    Given the circumstances of this particular claim, it was accepted that
    the requirement for the child A to remain on her own and in the absence
    of her family was not a realistic option.

58. In KO (Nigeria) at [23], the Supreme Court held that: '... the
    expression "unduly harsh" seems clearly intended to introduce a higher
    hurdle than that of "reasonableness" under section 117B(6), taking
    account of the public interest in the deportation of foreign criminals.
    Further the word "unduly" implies an element of comparison. It assumes
    that there is a "due" level of "harshness", that is a level which may
    be acceptable or justifiable in the relevant context. "Unduly" implies
    something going beyond that level.


59. Since the decision of the FtTJ under challenge, there have been two
    relevant decisions of the Court of Appeal in HA (Iraq) v SSHD [2020]
    EWCA Civ 1176 (4 September 2020) and AA (Nigeria) v SSHD [2020] EWCA
    Civ 1296 ( 9 October 2020).

60. In HA (Iraq) v SSHD [2020] EWCA Civ 1176 (4 September 2020), the Court
    of Appeal has given important clarification and guidance on the
    application and meaning of KO (Nigeria) and NA (Pakistan) .

61. So far as 'undue harshness' is concerned, the analysis is about
    identifying concerns above the 'commonplace' elements of family life.
    KO (Nigeria) should not be read entirely literally: '... it is hard  to
    see how one would define the level of harshness that would
    "necessarily" be suffered by "any" child  (indeed one can imagine
    unusual cases where the deportation of a parent would not be "harsh"
    for the
    child at all, even where there was a genuine and subsisting
    relationship). The underlying concept is clearly of an enhanced degree
    of harshness sufficient to outweigh the public interest' [�44]; '...

62. The underlying question for tribunals is whether the harshness which
    the deportation will cause for the partner and/or child is of a
    sufficiently elevated degree to outweigh that public interest.' [�51];

63. Ultimately, the analysis of 'undue harshness' (or 'very compelling
    circumstances') is an evaluative exercise for the Tribunal, on the
    individual facts before it: 'Observations of that kind are, I hope,
    helpful, but they cannot identify an objectively measurable standard.
    It is inherent in the nature of  an exercise [of the kind required by
    section 117C (5)] that Parliament intended that tribunals should  in
    each case make an informed evaluative assessment of whether the effect
    of the deportation of  the parent or partner on their child or partner
    would be "unduly harsh" in the context of the strong  public interest
    in the deportation of foreign criminals; and further exposition of that
    phrase will  never be of more than limited value' [�53];

64. The  exercise  is  acutely  fact-sensitive  (even  where  factual
    scenarios  appear  to  be  similar: KO  (Nigeria) did not therefore set
    down any possible factual precedent [�82-3], cases are never truly
    identical and a Tribunal must make an assessment on the basis of the
    case before it); '... if tribunals  treat the essential question as
    being "is this level of harshness out of the ordinary?" they may be
    tempted to find that Exception 2 does not apply simply on the basis
    that the situation fits into some  commonly-encountered pattern. That
    would be dangerous. How a child will be affected by a parent's
    deportation will depend on an almost infinitely variable range of
    circumstances and  it is not possible to identify a baseline of
    "ordinariness". Simply by way of example, the degree of harshness of
    the impact may be affected by the child's age; by whether the parent
    lives with by the degree of a child's emotional dependence on the
    parent; by the financial consequences of his deportation, by the
    availability of emotional financial support from the remaining parent
    and other family members; by the practicality of maintaining a
    relationship with a deported parent, or of course by all the individual
    characteristics of the child" [56].


65. In the conduct of this evaluative exercise the focus is on the
    individual child, and the effect on them  of deportation; and whether
    the terms of the relevant test are met: '...Tribunals [considering the
    parent case under Exception 2] should not err in law if in each case
    they carefully evaluate the  likely effect of the parent's deportation
    on the particular child and then decide whether that  effect is not
    merely harsh but unduly harsh...' [�57];

66. This approach is echoed in the second, shorter judgment of Peter
    Jackson LJ. The analysis must be adequately informed and specific to
    the individual child and look at matters from the perspective of  that
    child; the question for the Tribunal is explicitly about the effect on
    that child [�155]. It would be an error to focus on the position of
    children generally rather than the best interests of the individual
    child. The reference in KO (Nigeria) to the effect on 'any child' did
    not set up a notional comparator,
    because the circumstances of individual children differ.

67. Physical harm is not intrinsically more significant in that analysis
    than emotional harm [�156]. The Children Act defines harm as 'ill-
    treatment or the impairment of health or physical, intellectual,
    emotional, social or behavioural development. Reflecting our
    contemporary understanding of the importance of emotional development
    and mental health, there is no hierarchy as between physical and non-
    physical harm.' [�159]; '... it may be easier for decision-makers to
    envisage the harm that may  be done by expecting a family to experience
    precarious or even dangerous physical conditions than to  factor in at
    full worth the lifelong emotional harm of terminating the relationship
    between a child and  a close parent during the child's minority and
    possibly forever. Both situations are grim but for the child neither is
    intrinsically grimmer than the other.' [�159]

68. In AA (Nigeria)at [10] - [14] the Court of Appeal summarised the
    approach that should be adopted by the Tribunal in an appeal like the
    present one:
          1. "In relation to what is meant by "unduly harsh" in section
             117C(5), the authoritative guidance is now that given by Lord
             Carnwath JSC in KO (Nigeria) and by this court in HA (Iraq).
             The former addressed this issue notwithstanding that the main
             question in that case was not the meaning of "unduly harsh" but
             whether it involved consideration of the seriousness of the
             offence. At [23] he said:
                 "23. On the other hand, the expression "unduly harsh" seems
                 clearly intended to introduce a higher hurdle than that of
                 "reasonableness" under section 117B(6) , taking account of
                 the public interest in the deportation of foreign
                 criminals. Further the word "unduly" implies an element of
                 comparison. It assumes that there is a "due" level of
                 "harshness", that is a level which may be acceptable or
                 justifiable in the relevant context. "Unduly" implies
                 something going beyond that level. The relevant context is
                 that set by section 117C(1) , that is the public interest
                 in the deportation of foreign criminals. One is looking for
                 a degree of harshness going beyond what would necessarily
                 be involved for any child faced with the deportation of a
                 parent. What it does not require in my view (and subject to
                 the discussion of the cases in the next section) is a
                 balancing of relative levels of severity of the parent's
                 offence, other than is inherent in the distinction drawn by
                 the section itself by reference to length of sentence. Nor
                 (contrary to the view of the Court of Appeal in IT
                 (Jamaica) v Secretary of State for the Home Department
                 [2017] 1 WLR 240 , paras 55 and 64) can it be equated with
                 a requirement to show "very compelling reasons". That would
                 be in effect to replicate the additional test applied by
                 section 117C(6) with respect to sentences of four years or
                 more."
          1. At paragraph [27] he said:
                 "27. Authoritative guidance as to the meaning of "unduly
                 harsh" in this context was given by the Upper Tribunal
                 (McCloskey J President and Upper Tribunal Judge Perkins) in
                 MK (Sierra Leone) v Secretary of State for the Home
                 Department [2015] INLR 563 , para 46, a decision given on
                 15 April 2015. They referred to the "evaluative assessment"
                 required of the tribunal:
                       "By way of self-direction, we are mindful that
                       'unduly harsh' does not equate with uncomfortable,
                       inconvenient, undesirable or merely difficult.
                       Rather, it poses a considerably more elevated
                       threshold. 'Harsh' in this context, denotes something
                       severe, or bleak. It is the antithesis of pleasant or
                       comfortable. Furthermore, the addition of the adverb
                       'unduly' raises an already elevated standard still
                       higher."
          1. As explained in HA (Iraq) at [44] and [50] to [53], this does
             not posit some objectively measurable standard of harshness
             which is acceptable, but sets a bar which is more elevated than
             mere undesirability but not as high as the "very compelling
             circumstances" test in s.117C(6). Beyond that, further
             exposition of the phrase "unduly harsh" is of limited value.
             Moreover, as made clear at [56]-[57], it is potentially
             misleading and dangerous to seek to identify some "ordinary"
             level of harshness as an acceptable level by reference to what
             may be commonly encountered circumstances: there is no reason
             in principle why cases of undue hardship may not occur quite
             commonly; and how a child will be affected by a parent's
             deportation will depend upon an almost infinitely variable
             range of circumstances. It is not possible to identify a
             baseline of "ordinariness".
69. Having considered the grounds advanced on behalf of the respondent, I
    do not accept the submission that the FtTJ erred in law in his
    consideration of whether it would be unduly harsh for the child A to
    live in the country to which the appellant was to be deported, namely
    Afghanistan.


70. The grounds advanced on behalf of the respondent centre upon the FtTJ's
    assessment of the circumstances in Afghanistan and in particular as to
    the issue of education for child A in Afghanistan.

71. It is submitted that the effect upon A's education would not be "unduly
    harsh" nor in the alternative, would it amount to an unduly harsh
    outcome if she were to return to Afghanistan with her father and other
    family members. This is because she was only at secondary school and
    that the judge gave inadequate reasons as to why any disruption to her
    education would amount to "unduly harsh consequences" (I refer to the
    written grounds at paragraph (4)).

72. It is also submitted that the FtTJ did not resolve the "conflict on the
    evidence" referred to at paragraph [47], nor made any firm findings as
    to the availability of secondary education for A in Kabul. The
    respondent submits that this was a crucial element of the assessment of
    the interference to A's private life caused by the family's removal to
    Kabul and therefore could not be left as it was without any clear
    findings.

73. I have considered those submissions in the context of the evidence
    before the judge and the decision reached. Whilst the grounds centre
    upon the educational aspect of A's return to Afghanistan, the FtTJ in
    fact considered a number of elements including A' s private life
    established outside of her country of nationality, the impact of
    removal upon her, the length of residence in the UK and the stage that
    she had reached in her education, alongside the circumstances in
    Afghanistan for a young female child of the Sikh religion. This being a
    country that she had no knowledge of having left the country at the age
    of two and being unable to speak the language.

74. As to the evidence in relation to the issue of education, the judge
    considered a number of different source material. When reaching the
    decision as a whole, I do not consider that it can be said that there
    was such an unresolved conflict on the issue of education as the
    written submissions assert.

75. The FtTJ began his consideration by reference to the country guidance
    decision of TG at paragraph 20.5.  The FtTJ set out as to access to
    appropriate education for children in light of the discrimination
    against Sikh and  Hindu children and the shortage of adequate education
    facilities for them in TG the following was stated:



         "such education is only provided however up to and including
         primary level with the requirement that at secondary level children
         will be taught within the state system where they become exposed to
         problems referred to in the evidence unless an individual's family
         has the means to pay them to be educated privately. If credible
         evidence is provided of a real risk of such ill-treatment and
         harassment to a child on return sufficient to prevent them
         receiving a proper education, which is shown to be a fundamental
         element of their personal identity, that they wish to pursue,
         rather than a child not being further educated as a result of the
         traditional belief that they will continue within a family business
         and therefore do not require to be further educated or for some
         other reason, then this may amount to such serious discrimination
         either on its own or curative lay with other forms of
         discrimination such as to cross the threshold of persecution.
         However, this is a fact sensitive issue that must be considered in
         each case."

76. The judge noted that the appellants in the decision of TG failed to
    establish a risk of persecution on any basis including a child's access
    to education in Kabul.


77. The FtTJ went on to state "the evidence before me on access to
    education is mixed". The judge then went on to consider the state of
    the evidence from the different sources; noting that both the UNHCR
    guidelines and the respondent's CPIN dated May 2019 referred to the
    existence of government public schools for Sikh children (at [21] of
    the FtTJ's decision). The judge also noted that there had been
    widespread evidence of intimidation in other public schools and further
    noted that the expert whose report post-dated that material had made no
    reference to a government funded Sikh school.

78. However the judge later went on to state:
    "no source suggests that, contrary to TG, there is a government funded
    Sikh secondary school for girls. I conclude that, on the lower standard
    of proof, there is no such facility." Thus the FtTJ did resolve the
    conflict as to education.


79. While the respondent's ground refer to paragraph [47] and the
    observation made by the judge that there were some "conflicts in the
    objective evidence", I do not read that paragraph to be referring to
    education or whether  secondary school education was available but to
    what the judge had said at [26] and whether denial of access to
    education was  potentially persecutory as set out in the country
    guidance decision of TG, and that this was the feature or " conflict"
    that had not been addressed in the report of Mr Foxley, the expert.


80. I do not consider that the judge ignored the evidence in the CPIN (May
    2019). At 7.1.2 it stated "a privately funded Sikh school continues to
    operate in Jalalabad  (although the place of return for child A would
    be Kabul and not Jalalabad) and there is reference to Sikh children
    continuing to attend private international schools. At 7.1.3 it was
    stated that members of the Sikh and Hindu communities continue to
    refuse to send their children to public school due to harassment from
    other students, although there were only a few private school options
    available to them due to the decreasing sizes of the two communities
    and their members declining economic circumstances. Two schools in
    Kabul remained operational (as at report 2017). At 7.1.4 it was noted
    that the majority of Sikh families are unable to afford private school
    fees which range from 4000 to 5000 Afghani per child.

81. In any event, I accept the submission made by Ms Akinbolu that the
    issues identified by the FtTJ went beyond the issues of education and
    whether child A could attend school.

82. At paragraphs [26], [31] and [32] the FtTJ set out other factual
    findings made from the evidence which concerned the circumstances as
    they related to child A. They can be summarised as follows. A is a
    female child and as a consequence is vulnerable,  whilst risks to
    children are difficult to assess and whilst the expert stated children
    were at risk of low-level discrimination and prejudice and would need
    to exercise care if leaving the house, the FtTJ stated "I find this
    significant". The FtTJ identified that there was a risk of adverse
    treatment of A as a Sikh girl, limitation of her freedom of movement
    and the likelihood of a denial of access to secondary education. Whilst
    the judge did not find that they were sufficient to amount to
    persecution at [26] they were factors that were relevant and could
    rationally be taken into account when reaching conclusions on the issue
    of "undue harshness".

83. At [30] the judge considered A's private life, A having lived in the UK
    since the age of two and now being in the second year of secondary
    school. The judge stated, "significant new evidence of her private life
    was provided".

84. At [31] the FtTJ made reference to that private life established during
    her residence and that she had developed "an independent life and was
    continuing to develop it". The judge took into account her length of
    residence (10 years since the age of two), the stage that she had
    reached her education being the second year at secondary school, the
    letters of support from the school which referred to the detrimental
    effects upon her if removed to Afghanistan and "turmoil", the prospects
    of secondary education, that she could not speak Pashto and the general
    conditions that she would return to in Kabul not only as a female child
    but also as a Sikh.

85. The point also made by the judge in this context was that conditions on
    return would adversely impact upon A as a girl who had grown up
    enjoying a freer life in the UK and that she would need to be
    accompanied by male relatives whenever she went out. This is further
    considered at [32] where the judge considered that "the life she
    described as enjoying in the UK is in very stark contrast to what her
    life would be like in Kabul, where it would be highly circumscribed
    developmentally, socially and educationally, Mr Foxley states that care
    is taken whenever she leaves the home and TG and others refers to the
    need to be accompanied by a male relative. She will have none of the
    freedoms which is described as having here. The adverse effect upon her
    will be that much greater now that she is old enough to have
    experienced those freedoms for herself."

86. Thus the conclusion at [31] reached by the FtTJ was that the issues
    facing A "are significantly wider than the acquisition of an education,
    even of a secondary education; as indicated above, they encompass the
    severe restrictions that will be placed on her in almost all aspects of
    a private life if she is returned to Kabul, as is explained in her
    parents statements, in their oral evidence, and by Mr Foxley's report."

87. In this context the judge expressly had regard to the evidence of the
    appellant's parents which centred upon the descriptions of their
    daughter's independent life which had been established away from the
    family; that she enjoyed time going out alone with friends and
    attending parties, that she was highly interested in her education.
    There was also a letter from A herself.

88. Consequently, whilst the grounds advanced on behalf of the respondent
    centre upon the issue of education, in my judgement the submissions
    fail to address the other factual matters relied upon by the judge
    which formed the basis of the conclusion at [47] that the adverse
    effects of a return for A at this age were "sufficiently bleak and her
    life sufficiently circumscribed to be aptly described as "unduly
    harsh".

89. A point raised in the written grounds but not relied upon by Ms Everett
    was that when looking at the appellant's private life, the reference to
    covering herself and being accompanied outside were standard features
    of life for all women in Afghanistan and that the judge was required to
    consider this especially where the child was an Afghan national and not
    a British citizen.

90. I would accept that the nationality of A was an important factor.
    However in my judgement the submission fails to consider the factual
    assessment made by the judge which I have summarised above and set out
    at paragraphs 26, 31 and 32. It was not simply the restrictions faced
    by women in general but seen in the context of this particular child's
    life and the nature of the private life that she had established over a
    very lengthy period in the United Kingdom. The fact that she was a
    "qualifying child" was because Parliament had chosen to make a child
    who lived in the UK for a continuous period of over seven years as  A
    to be such a "qualifying child "for the purposes of section 5A
    irrespective of nationality. This is because such a length of residence
    is seen as significant for a child.

91. Insofar as the grounds assert that the judge did not say anything more
    about the pastoral care that she would require, a proper reading of the
    decision and the evidence before the tribunal did not require the
    appellant to demonstrate that she needed any particular type of
    "pastoral care" of any positive kind because the importance of that
    evidence rested on the detrimental effects of the removal of A from the
    United Kingdom. This was set out in the letter from the school and the
    judge was entitled to place weight upon the detrimental effects of
    removal upon A at this stage in her life having been in the UK since
    the age of two and having no recollection of life in Afghanistan. The
    effects of removal were described as leading to "turmoil" for her and
    was in this context of the reference was made to pastoral care.

92. In this context I have also considered the submission made by Ms
    Everett that with the support of her family this would have the effect
    of mitigating any problems that A may have on removal. However, this
    was expressly addressed by the FtTJ at [32] where the judge stated,
    "the presence of family members would not assist A in overcoming those
    wider issues".

93. Ms Everett on behalf of the respondent submitted in her oral argument
    that the FtTJ conflated the best interest's consideration set out at
    [31] with the assessment of "undue harshness" at [47]. She submitted
    that the best interest's consideration was entirely different from the
    undue harshness test and whilst there might be some overlap in the
    evidence, the judge did not recognise that this was a different test
    and relied upon the findings made at paragraph [31].

94. I am not satisfied that there is any such conflation as submitted by Ms
    Everett. The decision in HA (Iraq) properly accepted that the best
    interests of any child must be analysed. The relevant various factors
    pertaining to harshness and particularly undue harshness should be
    factored into any assessment. I accept the submission made by Ms
    Akinbolu that the FtTJ properly considered the best interest assessment
    at [31] solely from the child's perspective. The "unduly harsh" test
    considered by the FtTJ was informed by that best interest assessment.
    The judge did not elevate that assessment to be "paramount" but
    properly had regard to that best interest's assessment as a "primary
    consideration".


95. The FtTJ did not have the advantage of the  case law in HA (Iraq) and
    AA (Nigeria) but on my reading of his decision, his approach and his
    analysis were to adopt a fact sensitive approach and consider the
    particular child with whom he was concerned. The case law demonstrates
    that such an analysis should be adequately informed and specific to the
    individual child, looking at matters from the perspective of the child.
    That includes a wide range of considerations- not only physical well-
    being but also psychological and emotional well-being and risk of
    future harm and effects upon socialisation, effects upon their
    education and adverse impairment of their relationship with others.
    When reading the decision as a whole and in the context of the
    evidence, the judge undertook his analysis with that in mind.

96. Whilst it is argued on behalf of the respondent that the FtTJ erred in
    law by failing to have regard to the decision in SSHD v PG (Jamaica)
    [2019] EWCA Civ 1213, paragraph [9]of AA (Nigeria) states "It will
    usually be unhelpful to refer first instance judges to other examples
    of their application to the particular facts of other cases and seek to
    draw factual comparisons by way of similarities or differences.
    Decisions in this area will involve an examination of the many
    circumstances making up private or family life, which are infinitely
    variable, and will require a close focus on the particular individual
    private and family lives in question, judged cumulatively on their own
    terms".


97. In my judgement in reaching his decision Judge Randall, properly
    applied the correct test. Whilst the threshold is a high one, the
    assessment made by the FtTJ properly took that threshold into account.
    Given that the role of the tribunal is to make an informed evaluative
    assessment of whether the effect of the deportation on A would be
    "unduly harsh" in the context of strong public interest in the
    deportation of foreign criminals, and requires a careful analysis of
    all the relevant factors specific to the child, I am satisfied that
    that evaluative assessment was one that was undertaken by the judge and
    one that properly took into account the relevant material, both
    objective and subjective.

98. This was an unusual case which centred upon the circumstances of A as a
    "qualifying child" by reason of her long residence in United Kingdom as
    a child from the age of two. The assessment of such a claim is a highly
    fact sensitive task and the judge was required to consider the evidence
    a whole and I am satisfied that the judge clearly did so and contrary
    to the grounds, gave adequate reasons for his decision.

99. The question whether the decision contains a material error of law is
    not whether another Judge could have reached the opposite conclusion
    but whether this Judge reached a conclusion by appropriately directing
    himself as to the relevant law and assessing the evidence on a rational
    and lawful basis.

100. The judge had the advantage of considering all the evidence in the
    case.  As the Supreme Court stated in Henderson v Foxworth Investments
    Ltd [2014] UKSC 41; [2014] 1 WLR 2600 at [62]:

         "It does not matter, with whatever degree of  certainty,  that  the
         appellate court considers that it would have  reached  a  different
         conclusion. What matters is whether the decision  under  appeal  is
         one that no reasonable judge could have reached.

101. In any given case an evaluative exercise of  this  kind  may  admit  of
    more than one answer.  If so, provided all the appropriate factors have
    been taken into account, the decision cannot be impugned unless  it  is
    perverse or irrational, in a sense of  falling  outside  the  range  of
    permissible decisions.  It has not  been  advanced  on  behalf  of  the
    respondent that the decision of the judge  or  his  assessment  of  the
    evidence (including the  expert  evidence)  was  either  irrational  or
    perverse. As UTJ Kebede observed, it may ultimately  be  found  in  the
    grounds are no more than a disagreement with the decision. That is what
    I have found for the reasons set out above.

102. Consequently, it has not been demonstrated by the grounds as argued  by
    the respondent that the decision of the  FtTJ  involved  making  of  an
    error on a point of law.

Decision

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the  making  of
    an error on a point of law.  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal to
    allow the appeal stands.
