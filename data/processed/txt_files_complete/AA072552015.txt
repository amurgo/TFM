Representation

For the Appellant:     Mr K Smyth, Kesar & Co Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. I continue the anonymity direction made by  the  First-tier  Tribunal,
      which is to  remain  in  place  unless  this  Tribunal  or  any  other
      appropriate court directs otherwise.  As  such,  no  report  of  these
      proceedings shall directly or indirectly identify the appellant or any
      member of his family. Failure to  comply  with  this  direction  could
      amount to contempt of court.


   2. The appellant is an ethnic Kurd and is a national of Iran, born  there
      on [ ] 1997. His appeal against the decision of the respondent  on  24
      April 2015 to refuse his asylum application and to remove him from the
      UK, was dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge Traynor in  a  decision
      promulgated on 25 November 2015.


   3. The Judge found that the appellant had not established that he  has  a
      well founded fear of persecution in Iran. In dismissing the appeal  he
      accepted that the appellant had worked as  a  smuggler  and  had  been
      arrested and detained on one occasion when caught  smuggling.  It  was
      also accepted that on the second occasion he had been shot at and  had
      run away to avoid being caught for smuggling  and  that  there  was  a
      Court summons issued for him in Iran [22]. The activity  that  he  was
      involved in related to the movement of diesel or alternatively  petrol
      and gas oil, collecting it from one place and  taking  it  to  another
      village approximately an hour from where he lived [13].


   4. About 4-5 months prior to his leaving Iran, he was  with  a  group  of
      between 10 and 20 people who were caught  by  the  authorities  whilst
      engaged in this activity. He claimed that he had been taken to an army
      camp where they were held for two or three  nights.  His  family  were
      contacted and were able to arrange for a payment of a bribe to  secure
      his release.


   5. Those who procured his release told him that he should not work for  a
      while and that if he were caught again, he would not be released.


   6. He waited about a month to replace the horse that the authorities  had
      killed when he was first detained. He then began to smuggle again.  He
      was told that he was permitted to smuggle between the  hours  of  10pm
      and 4am. Anyone caught smuggling outside those hours would be  set  on
      fire or alternatively shot.


   7. Despite this, he decided to join others who were smuggling before 7pm.
      He claimed that they were intercepted by the authorities who began  to
      fire at them and, as a result, some of the group were killed.  He  was
      able to make good his escape to Khelakn, where his family has land and
      where he was able to hide at a house for five days [15].


   8. He claimed that his brother was  told  that  the  appellant  had  been
      smuggling out of hours, following which the home was searched and  his
      family humiliated. He claimed that a court summons  addressed  to  him
      was received at his home. In due course, arrangements  were  made  for
      him to be taken from Iran in order to avoid the problems that he faced
      there [15].


   9. The respondent did not accept that the appellant had established  that
      he had a well founded fear of persecution in Iran.  In  particular  it
      was not accepted that simply because he  had  received  a  summons  he
      would face inhuman  and  degrading  treatment  or  that  he  would  be
      persecuted on account of his past activity.  Whilst  noting  that  the
      penalty for drug smuggling is death, there was no evidence that in the
      case of those smuggling other items  in  Iran  that  they  would  face
      anything other than  prosecution  and  the  likely  consequence  of  a
      custodial sentence. It was  not  accepted  that  he  would  receive  a
      harsher sentence or that the activities in which he was  involved  for
      the second time meant that he  was  at  greater  risk  of  facing  ill
      treatment, sufficient to amount to persecution [23].


  10. The respondent considered that his  fear  was  subjective.  There  was
      nothing in his evidence or in the background material suggesting  that
      he would face  a  sentence  of  anything  more  than  several  months'
      detention  or  a  fine  for  his  involvement  in  these   activities.
      Fundamentally, his fear was one of prosecution rather than persecution
      [23].


  11. The Judge had regard to the Tribunal's decision in SB (Risk on  Return
      - Illegal Exit) Iran CG [2009] UKAIT 00053 and in particular paragraph
      (ii) of the headnote, namely, that Iranians facing enforced return  do
      not in general face a real risk of persecution or ill treatment, which
      remains the case even if they exited  Iran  illegally.  Having  exited
      Iran illegally is not a sufficient risk factor, although if it is  the
      case that a person would face difficulties with  the  authorities  for
      other reasons, such a history could be a factor adding to the level of
      difficulties he or she is likely to face.


  12. The Judge also set out headnote (iii): being a  person  who  has  left
      Iran  when  facing  court  proceedings  (other  than  ordinary   civil
      proceedings) is a risk  factor,  although  much  will  depend  on  the
      particular facts relating to the nature of the offence(s) involved and
      other circumstances. The more the offences for which  a  person  faces
      trial are likely to be viewed as political, the greater the  level  of
      risk likely to arise as a result. Given the emphasis  placed  both  by
      the expert report from Dr Kahki and the April 2009 Danish fact finding
      report's sources on the degree of risk varying according to the nature
      of the Court proceedings, being involved in ongoing court  proceedings
      is not in itself something  that  will  automatically  result  in  ill
      treatment; rather it is probably to be considered as a risk factor  to
      be taken into account along with others.


  13. In headnote (iv) the Tribunal held that being  a  person  involved  in
      court proceedings in Iran who has engaged in conduct likely to be seen
      as insulting either to the judiciary or the justice system, government
      or Islam constitutes another risk factor indicating an increased level
      of risk of persecution or ill treatment on return.


  14.  Judge  Traynor  also  had  regard  to  the  earlier  decision  of  BA
      (Demonstrators in Britain - Risk on Return) Iran  CG  [2011]  UKUT  36
      (IAC). He referred to the background  material  contained  within  the
      country guidance cases. He also had regard to documents referred to in
      the  respondent's  decision  letter  and  the  Home   Office   country
      information and guidance document for Iran, regarding Kurds, issued in
      August 2015.


  15. In his findings, Judge Traynor noted that the respondent accepted  the
      appellant's account of events which led him to  leave  Iran.  However,
      the respondent did not accept  that  his  subjective  fear,  including
      being killed because of his disregard for a warning that was given  to
      him concerning smuggling activity, is objectively well founded because
      the background material did not support his claim in that regard.


  16. The appellant had also claimed that his fear arose because the summons
      issued against him came from Mohabad or  Ormieh,  and  not  his  local
      area, Sarsasht. This would mean that  it  was  likely  he  would  face
      serious consequences for his activity [42].


  17. The Judge found however that he had not supported that  claim  by  any
      objective  evidence.  He  noted  'conversely'  that   the   respondent
      highlighted at paragraph 27 of  the  refusal  letter  various  reports
      which he referred to at [42].


  18. The  Judge  stated  at  [43]  that  having  carefully  considered  the
      appellant's evidence, that whilst he  has  given  a  credible  account
      consistent with the background material, there is no evidence that  he
      has adduced which would support his  conclusion  that  he  would  face
      death upon return to Iran because of his activity. If, as claimed, the
      summons is awaiting him, then, at  its  worst,  the  authorities  will
      refer him on to the authorities in  an  area  where  the  summons  was
      issued and he will have to attend court. If he  is  detained  in  that
      process then there is no evidence to suggest that  he  would  be  held
      incommunicado or that he would not be duly transferred.


  19. The Judge referred to the background evidence which  showed  that  the
      appellant had been involved in an activity upon which the  authorities
      in Iran are clamping down. There was no evidence to  show  that  aside
      from the indiscriminate shooting of those who  are  involved  in  that
      activity at the time they are active, that those who are  subsequently
      detained are treated any differently to those who have not been  shot.
      In short, the Judge found that in all reasonable likelihood  he  would
      face the potential of a short custodial sentence or,  more  likely,  a
      fine for his activity. Where he has not been caught in  possession  of
      smuggled goods, but was known to have been present at a time when such
      goods were being smuggled, the appellant does not raise his profile in
      a way that would aggravate his activities 'such as to render a harsher
      sentence' [44].


  20. Moreover the Judge found at [45] that following the  guidance  in  SB,
      supra, there is no reasonable likelihood that  the  authorities  would
      consider his activity in Iran to have been  politically  motivated  or
      his presence in the UK to have any  political  association.  The  mere
      fact that he would be returning from the UK would not  be  interpreted
      by the authorities as someone who is  anything  other  than  a  failed
      asylum seeker who has exited Iran solely to avoid prosecution and  not
      on account of any anti-revolutionary activity [45].


  21. At [46] he found that at its  highest,  the  authorities  will  either
      sentence him to a short term of imprisonment  and/or  a  fine.  It  is
      clear that his parents have the resources to pay bribes of up  to  4-5
      million Toman and there was nothing to suggest  that  they  could  not
      afford to do  this  as  they  have  done  when  paying  for  his  past
      transgressions by arranging a bribe to be paid for his release [46].


  22. The Judge did not accept the contention made on the appellant's behalf
      that merely because he was involved in illegal activity this would  be
      perceived  as  "anti-  revolutionary"  and  therefore  considered   as
      politically motivated. That was a tenuous argument to which he gave no
      weight. It was unlikely that he would receive an unreasonably harsh or
      disproportionate sentence for the activity in which he  was  involved.
      It is likely that he would be able to return to his home area  and  be
      reunited with his family once he is there and has been duly  processed
      for his criminal activity [47].


  23. On 4 January 2016, First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Grimmett  granted  the
      appellant permission to appeal. The  appellant  had  asserted  in  his
      grounds that the Judge erred in concluding that  it  was  more  likely
      that he would face  a  fine  for  smuggling  than  a  short  custodial
      sentence. It was arguable that it is not clear why the  Judge  reached
      that conclusion. It also appears that the Judge erred  in  failing  to
      deal with the issues of  prison  conditions  raised  in  the  skeleton
      argument. In  the  grounds  of  appeal,  it  was  contended  that  the
      appellant's account that his summons was issued from Mohabad or Ormieh
      and he would thus face consequences far more serious than  if  it  had
      been issued from Sarsasht.


  24. Mr Smyth, who represented the appellant before the First-tier tribunal
      - his name was incorrectly spelled  in  the  decision  -  referred  to
      paragraphs [31] and [43] and [44] of the determination  which  I  have
      set out, where the Judge found that it was reasonably likely that  the
      appellant would face the potential of a short  custodial  sentence  or
      more likely a fine for his activity. The evidence cited by  the  Judge
      at [31] is contained in paragraph 27 of the refusal letter.


  25. At paragraph 27 of the reasons for refusal, the secretary of state set
      out the background information that was considered. This was a  report
      by the International Campaign for Human Rights  in  Iran  and  a  USSD
      report dated 2012. The report noted at paragraph 64 that  the  Special
      Rapporteur was informed of the systematic killings  of  Kulbars  (back
      carriers). The Kulbaran who ferry cargo across  the  border  on  their
      backs or smuggle commodities such as tea, tobacco and fuel to  earn  a
      living are particularly affected. Iranian law regards  the  activities
      of the Kulbari as a  crime  that  is  punishable  by  several  months'
      detention or a fine equal to the value of the seized commodities.


  26. Mr Smyth submitted that the passage provided no evidential  basis  for
      Judge Traynor's finding at [44]  that  it  is  more  likely  that  the
      appellant would face a fine rather than a  short  custodial  sentence.
      Applying the correct standard of proof, the logical conclusion is that
      it is reasonably likely that the appellant will  face  detention  upon
      return, especially as he had been detained on a previous occasion.


  27. He further submitted that the appellant's skeleton  argument  produced
      at the hearing contained the submission that detention  conditions  in
      Iran would breach Article 3. Reference was made to evidence  from  the
      US  Department  of  State  regarding  poor   prison   conditions   and
      mistreatment of prisoners.  There  was  also  a  report  from  Amnesty
      International referred to in the skeleton  as  to  the  prevalence  of
      torture  and  other  ill  treatment  particularly  during  pre   trial
      detention.


  28. He submitted that although the Judge stated at [38] that full  account
      of the skeleton argument  had  been  taken,  he  failed  to  make  any
      findings at all regarding the appellant's  claim  that  conditions  in
      detention would breach Article 3. He submitted that the conclusion  by
      the Judge  at  [52]  that  he  was  satisfied  that  the  respondent's
      representative  was  entirely  correct   in   identifying   that   the
      appellant's human rights claim should stand or fall  with  his  asylum
      claim was "entirely  incorrect  and  that  oversight  meant  that  his
      decision cannot stand."


  29. The Judge at [43] had stated that if he is detained  in  that  process
      there is no evidence to suggest that he would be held incommunicado or
      that he would not be duly transferred.


  30. Mr Smyth referred to  the  Amnesty  International  report  of  2014-15
      contained in the appellant's bundle at B75. At B77 of that  report  it
      is stated that torture and other ill  treatment,  particularly  during
      pre trial detention remains common, facilitated by routine  denial  of
      access to lawyers and the virtual impunity  of  perpetrators.  Methods
      reported included: solitary confinement, confinement in  uncomfortably
      small spaces, severe beatings, threats against the  detainee's  family
      members. The authorities generally fail to investigate allegations  of
      torture and prosecute and punish those responsible.


  31. The authorities systematically deny detainees and prisoners access  to
      adequate medical care, including for injuries resulting  from  torture
      or health problems exacerbated by harsh prison conditions.


  32. A revised code of Criminal Procedure passed in April failed to address
      the inadequacies  of  national  laws  to  afford  detainees  effective
      protection  against  torture  and  other  ill  treatment.  It   denied
      detainees access to lawyers for up to one week after arrest  in  cases
      concerning national security and some other offences, and provided  no
      clear  and  comprehensive  definition   of   torture   conforming   to
      international law.


  33. In the circumstances, Mr Smyth  submitted  that  the  Judge  erred  in
      finding without any basis that it was more likely that  the  appellant
      would receive a fine as opposed to detention and that  the  conditions
      would not amount to torture and other ill  treatment  during  any  pre
      trial detention.


  34. On behalf of the respondent, Mr Bramble submitted  that  the  decision
      has to be looked at in its entirety. He  highlighted  what  the  Judge
      stated in the lengthy paragraph at [46], namely that at  its  highest,
      the  authorities  will  either  sentence  him  to  a  short  term   of
      imprisonment and/or a fine. His parents have sufficient  resources  to
      pay that.


  35. Moreover, at [47] he found that the appellant's fear of  returning  to
      Iran related to his fear of prosecution. It is unlikely that  he  will
      receive an unreasonably harsh or  disproportionate  sentence  for  the
      activity in which he has been involved. It is likely he will  be  able
      to return to his home area and be reunited with his family once he  is
      there and has been duly processed  for  his  criminal  activity.  That
      particular paragraph shows that  the  Judge  was  not  predisposed  to
      finding that he would receive a fine for  his  activities  and  not  a
      custodial sentence. That was left open.


  36. Mr Bramble accepted that Judge Traynor  had  not  dealt  at  all  with
      issues relating to  potential  problems  faced  by  the  appellant  if
      detained on return.


  37. Mr Bramble nevertheless posed the question as to whether that omission
      constituted a material error in the circumstances. He noted  that  the
      skeleton argument on behalf of the appellant  contained  a  submission
      that given the appellant's history  there  was  a  real  risk  of  the
      appellant finding himself detained in conditions contrary  to  Article
      3. In that regard reference was made to the  US  Department  of  State
      report of 2014,  B22.  That  contained  prison  and  detention  centre
      conditions in Iran. He submitted that it must be borne  in  mind  that
      the appellant is from the Kurdish areas of Iran. It depended on  which
      court the appellant would find himself in; there is no evidence as  to
      what prison he would be sent to.


  38. He referred to the "physical conditions" contained in  the  Department
      of State's report at B22. Reference is made to  overcrowding,  forcing
      many prisoners to sleep on floors, in hallways  or  in  prison  yards.
      There were reports that overcrowding within Evin Prison  had  worsened
      over the past year. There were reports  of  juvenile  offenders  being
      detained with adults. Pre-trial detainees were occasionally held  with
      convicted prisoners. Political prisoners were often held  in  separate
      prisons or wards.


  39. He referred to  the  reference  to  numerous  human  rights  NGOs  and
      opposition  websites  which  reported  poor  prison   conditions   and
      mistreatment of prisoners. There were reports  of  prisoner  suicides.
      There was a reference to a prisoner in Bandar Abbas  Central  Prison's
      Ward 1 who had been arrested on a charge of drug possession  who  took
      pills and hanged himself. There were reports of two inmates at  Ghezel
      Hesar Prison having committed suicide and two others who had attempted
      suicide during the same week.


  40. It is noted at B23 that during the year, several prisoners, especially
      political prisoners, went  on  hunger  strike  to  protest  at  prison
      conditions.


  41. The report however  does  not  suggest  that  it  was  only  political
      prisoners who were protesting against the conditions. At B23 there  is
      a report that on April 17, security  officials  raided  Evin  Prison's
      Ward 350 where political prisoners were  held.  They  were  reportedly
      beaten there. There is also a report in the same paragraph to an event
      on 15 May reported by Amnesty International that  officials,  some  in
      plain clothes and wearing masks, assaulted prisoners for several hours
      causing injuries that included loss of hearing,  fractures,  cuts  and
      bruises and led to hospitalisation of several  prisoners.  It  is  not
      clear from that paragraph whether the May 15 assault was  carried  out
      against the political prisoners or those perceived as being hostile to
      the government.


  42. Mr Bramble again referred to B77 containing  the  Amnesty  report.  He
      submitted that it is not suggested  that  the  appellant's  activities
      amounted to anything like a threat to national security and the like.


  43. Mr Bramble referred to SB, supra. Iranians facing enforced  return  do
      not in general face a real risk of persecution or  ill  treatment.  He
      submitted that the appellant was not at any heightened risk on account
      of political opinion, insulting conduct or activity likely to be  seen
      as insulting to the judicial system, the government or Islam. This  is
      in no way a political case or a national security charge.


  44. The appellant accordingly does not appear to fall within  one  of  the
      categories placing him at risk of ill treatment, even if detained.  He
      submitted therefore that it is unlikely  that  the  Judge  would  have
      found that detention would place him at risk such that his  Article  3
      rights might be contravened.


  45. In reply, Mr Smyth submitted that the Judge had to ask himself whether
      there was a real risk that if detained, he would  be  exposed  to  ill
      treatment contrary to Article 3. This had not been dealt with  by  the
      Judge at all, notwithstanding evidence presented to the Judge  as  set
      out in the skeleton for him. The preceding paragraphs at B22 relate to
      political  prisoners  but  the  later  paragraphs  relate  to   prison
      detainees generally.


      Assessment


  46. The Judge had regard to submissions at [36]  that  the  appellant  had
      received a summons which  would  of  itself  heighten  his  risk  upon
      return. The appellant explained his fear that where  the  summons  had
      been issued from a court outside his home area, the likelihood is that
      he would receive a lengthy custodial sentence and it was  possible  he
      could be killed for his offending. The fact that he had been  involved
      in smuggling activity in the past and that  the  Revolutionary  Guards
      had fired on those involved in that smuggling was indicative that they
      would view his conduct as  "anti  revolutionary"  as  he  had  ignored
      warnings given and he would therefore be placed at risk.


  47. At [34] the Judge noted that the appellant's representative, Mr Smyth,
      confirmed his  reliance  upon  the  skeleton  argument.  It  had  been
      submitted that in all reasonable likelihood, the appellant would  face
      difficulty upon his return. The fact that he had  received  a  summons
      and would not be considered to be a first time  offender  would  raise
      his profile and therefore increase the risk that he is likely to face.




  48. The Judge considered the respondent's acceptance  of  the  appellant's
      account of events, leading him to leave Iran. At [43] the Judge  found
      that having considered his evidence and the fact that he had  given  a
      credible account, there was no evidence adduced  which  would  support
      his conclusion that he would face death upon return to Iran because of
      this activity. He stated that if the summons is awaiting him, then  at
      its worst, the authorities will refer him on to the authorities in the
      area where the summons was issued and he will have to attend Court. If
      he is detained in that process then there is no  evidence  to  suggest
      that he would be held incommunicado or  that  he  would  not  be  duly
      transferred [43].


  49. He stated at [44] that he found that in all reasonable likelihood, the
      appellant would face the potential of a short custodial  sentence  or,
      more likely, a fine for his activity.


  50. At [46] the Judge again concluded that at its highest the  authorities
      will either sentence him to a short  term  of  imprisonment  and/or  a
      fine. He did not accept that because the  appellant  was  involved  in
      illegal activity that this would be perceived as  "anti-revolutionary"
      and therefore be considered as politically motivated. The Judge  found
      that his  fear  of  returning  to  Iran  is  of  prosecution  and  not
      persecution. It is unlikely he will receive an unreasonably  harsh  or
      disproportionate sentence [47].


  51. From the foregoing it is evident that the Judge has largely focused on
      the likely outcome of a sentence upon the appellant on his return.


  52. In this respect, he found that there was no basis  from  any  evidence
      presented, that the appellant would more likely receive a fine for his
      activity as opposed to a short custodial sentence [44].


  53. However, apart from a fleeting reference to the potential detention of
      the appellant, he found at [43] that there was no evidence to  suggest
      that  he  would  be  held  incommunicado.   There   was   however   no
      consideration given of the evidence presented to him as set out in the
      skeleton argument.


  54. I bear in mind the  submissions  made  by  Mr  Bramble  that  properly
      assessed,  the  reports  relating  to  torture  and   ill   treatment,
      particularly during pre-trial detention, appear to relate  to  persons
      involved in national security  offences  or  offences  that  might  be
      viewed as political or  which  might  be  seen  as  insulting  to  the
      government or Islam. This would not affect the appellant.


  55. However, it is not clear that the Amnesty International report at  B77
      is focused upon those suspected of  national  security  offences.  The
      opening paragraph appears to be a general reference to torture and ill
      treatment during pre-trial detention, which remains common.  There  is
      reference  to  prolonged  solitary  confinement  or   confinement   in
      uncomfortably small spaces, severe beatings, threats and the like.


  56. Similarly, in the US Department of State report for 2014 at B22, there
      is  again  reference  to  prison  conditions  and   detention   centre
      conditions being often  harsh  and  life  threatening.  This  included
      reports of juvenile offenders being detained with adults.


  57. There is reference to overcrowding and ill  treatment,  including  the
      refusal of medical treatment for injuries that  prisoners  suffer.  At
      B21, when dealing with torture and other cruel, inhuman  or  degrading
      treatment or punishments, there is reference to "white torture"  being
      used especially on political prisoners and often in detention  centres
      outside the control of prison authorities. There is nothing to suggest
      at B22  and  23  that  the  conditions  reported  as  harsh  and  life
      threatening pertained only to those who were  political  prisoners  as
      such. The examples of prisoners who were charged  on  drug  possession
      and took their lives at one of the prisons did not  appear  to  be  an
      example of a political or national security offence.


  58. Mr Bramble has very properly accepted that the Judge did not deal with
      the submissions made at paragraph  14  and  onwards  of  the  skeleton
      argument that had been relied on. This also contained a  reference  to
      paragraph 29 of the appellant's witness statement  dated  19  November
      2014 contained in the respondent's bundle where the  appellant  stated
      that while in Saradasht there is a chance of being released; if one is
      taken to Orumiyeh, or Mahabad, he will then not come back. Mahabad  is
      stated to be "precisely from where the Court summons originates."


  59. I cannot be sure that if the Judge had properly assessed the  evidence
      and the reports as a whole, he would inevitably have come to the  same
      conclusion regarding the asserted  real  risk  of  being  detained  in
      conditions contrary to Article 3.


  60. In the circumstances I find that in making te decision there has  been
      an error on a point of law. I accordingly set aside the  decision.  It
      follows that there will need to be a re-hearing.


  61. Both parties accepted that should the decision be set aside, this  was
      an appropriate case to  be  remitted  to  Taylor  House  for  a  fresh
      decision. There had been no findings of fact made in relation  to  the
      Article 3 issues.  Taking into account the Practice Statement, I agree
      that this is an appropriate case to  be  remitted  to  the  First-tier
      Tribunal. The  positive  findings  of  fact  made  by  the  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge will be retained. Both parties are  permitted  to  file
      and serve further evidence.


  62. The appeal is accordingly remitted  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  at
      Taylor House, to be remade by another Judge.


      Notice of Decision


      The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside and  is  remitted
      to the First-tier Tribunal at Taylor House to be remade, with  a  time
      estimate of two hours.


      Anonymity direction is made.
