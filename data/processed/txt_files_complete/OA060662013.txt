Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms J Isherwood, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr W Rees, Counsel


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. This is an appeal by the Entry Clearance Officer (ECO). However, for  the
   purposes of this decision, I shall refer to the ECO as the respondent and
   Mr Cheklat as the appellant, reflecting their positions as they  were  in
   the appeal before the First-tier Tribunal.

2. The appellant is a citizen of Algeria, born on 23 May  1980.  He  applied
   for entry clearance as a partner under Appendix  FM  of  the  immigration
   rules, in order to settle in the United Kingdom with his wife.

3. The  appellant's  application  was  refused  on  4  February  2013  under
   paragraph E-ECP.2.6 & 2.10 on the grounds that it was not  accepted  that
   the relationship was genuine and subsisting and that the parties intended
   to live together permanently; and with respect to the rules  relating  to
   the financial requirements of Appendix FM, under  paragraphs  EC-P.1.1(d)
   and E-ECP.3.1 of Appendix FM. The former ground  for  refusal  under  EC-
   P.1.1(d) was subsequently conceded  on  review  by  the  Entry  Clearance
   Manager.  With  regard  to  paragraphs  EC-P.1.1(d)  and  E-ECP.3.1,  the
   respondent noted that the appellant was relying on income from his wife's
   employment to confirm her gross income of at least �18,600 per  annum  as
   required under the rules. However the evidence  did  not  show  that  her
   income reached the required amount.

4. In  reviewing  the  decision  relating  to  the  financial  requirements,
   following the appellant's claim in his grounds of appeal that the sponsor
   had a gross income of �19,000 per  annum,  the  Entry  Clearance  Manager
   (ECM) considered that the evidence produced showed that the  sponsor  had
   earned �11,647 for the financial year 2012 up until 23 November 2012. The
   appellant had provided only payslips with no  further  evidence  to  show
   that the financial threshold had been met. The ECM noted that the sponsor
   had suggested in a letter supporting the appeal that if she had submitted
   a further six months worth of payslips she would have  demonstrated  that
   she had met  the  threshold.  However,  having  considered  the  payslips
   accompanying the application the ECM was not satisfied that that was  the
   case as a calculation of the mean average weekly gross payment multiplied
   by 52 provided an annual salary of �17,593. In any  event  it  was  noted
   that only 24 payslips had been submitted for a period of 34 weeks from  6
   April 2012 to 23 November 2012 which indicated that either a  salary  was
   not received every week or the pay may have been lower in some weeks. The
   ECM noted a letter from Caf� Med stating that the  sponsor's  salary  was
   �19,000 per annum but that employment started in January 2013, after  the
   date of the application, and was not accompanied by any further evidence.
   The ECM therefore maintained the decision to refuse the application.

5. The appellant's appeal against that decision was heard in the  First-tier
   Tribunal on 28 November 2013 by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Devittie.  The
   judge noted that the sponsor accepted that at times she did not receive a
   payslip from her employer but confirmed that she did receive a salary  on
   each occasion. She produced bank statements  as  evidence  of  that.  The
   judge was satisfied  from  the  bank  statements  that  the  sponsor  had
   received 52 weeks of pay amounting to a gross  salary  of,  at  the  very
   least, �17,593 and was satisfied that the figure calculated  by  the  ECM
   was the correct one. He was satisfied that he was entitled  to  take  the
   bank statements into account. With regard to the shortfall, the judge was
   satisfied that that was met by evidence showing  that  in  settlement  of
   legal proceedings taken by the  sponsor  against  her  employer  she  had
   received �2000 in unpaid wages. He accepted that if that award was  taken
   into account and added to the �17,593 the sponsor's annual  gross  income
   exceeded the required financial threshold. With regard to evidence of the
   sponsor's current employment, the judge  accepted  that  that  was  post-
   decision evidence but considered  it  relevant  to  the  extent  that  it
   demonstrated her earning capacity.  He  accordingly  allowed  the  appeal
   under the immigration rules.

6. Permission to appeal against that decision was sought by  the  respondent
   on the grounds that the judge had had no regard to the rules on specified
   evidence and  that  at  the  date  of  the  appellant's  application  the
   sponsor's income did not meet the  specified  evidence  rules  on  income
   threshold.

7. Permission was granted on 28 January 2014 on the grounds raised.

Appeal hearing

8. In response to my enquiry, Mr Rees  confirmed  that  there  had  been  no
   evidence of the �2000 settlement before the Entry  Clearance  Officer  or
   the Entry Clearance Manager. The  appellant's  difficulty  was  that  the
   sponsor had been employed by a rogue employer who had  not  provided  her
   with a contract of employment or continuous  payslips.  The  sponsor  had
   taken her employer to the Employment Tribunal because she  was  summarily
   dismissed as a result of her  pregnancy  but  her  employer  had  settled
   before the case got to the tribunal. She had been dismissed a  day  after
   the appellant's application. The evidence of that was before  the  First-
   tier Tribunal and was not challenged by the respondent. Mr Rees  provided
   me with documentation from ACAS relating to the legal proceedings.

9. Ms Isherwood  submitted  that  the  appellant  was  unable  to  meet  the
   requirements of the immigration rules. Article 8 had never been raised as
   a ground of appeal  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  or  to  the  Upper
   Tribunal. The appeal was allowed on the basis of the �2000 award but  the
   ECO and ECM were not aware of that. The sponsor had accepted that she had
   failed to provide the specified documents. The ECM had tried to assist by
   calculating a gross annual income on the evidence provided,  even  though
   the specified documents had not been produced, but had concluded that the
   income was insufficient. The �2000 was not foreseeable at the date of the
   decision as the sponsor may not have succeeded in the proceedings.

10. Mr Rees, in response submitted  that  the  ECO  had  not  contacted  the
   appellant as required under Appendix FM-SE D(b). The sponsor had a  cast-
   iron case before the Employment Tribunal  and  would  have  received  her
   remaining salary. The �2000 related to her period of employment  and  was
   relevant. She could have clarified the shortfall with  the  ECO  had  she
   been asked. Appendix FM-SE did not  cover  the  sponsor's  circumstances.
   Section D(e) gave the ECO discretion not to apply the requirement for the
   specified  documents  and  the  judge  was  entitled  to  exercise   that
   discretion. There was ample evidence of a gross income above �18,000 even
   without taking the �2000 into account.

11. In response to my  enquiries,  Mr  Rees  confirmed  that  there  was  no
   evidence of payments of tax by the sponsor.

12. In response, Ms Isherwood submitted that the judge  accepted,  from  his
   own  calculations,  that  the  evidence  of  gross  annual   income   was
   insufficient and allowed the appeal only by accepting the evidence of the
   �2000. He erred by doing so.

13. I enquired of the parties whether  there  was  further  evidence  to  be
   submitted in the event of the decision being set aside. It did not appear
   that there was. Mr Rees confirmed that the appeal had been  presented  on
   the basis of the immigration rules and Article 8 had not been raised.

Consideration and findings.

14.  I do not accept Mr Rees' submission that the judge was  satisfied  that
   there was evidence of adequate gross annual income without taking account
   of the �2000 award. It is clear that the existence of the �2000 award was
   the only basis upon which he allowed the  appeal,  having  quite  clearly
   found, at paragraphs 4 and 5 of his determination, that  he  agreed  with
   and accepted the figure reached by  the  ECM  for  the  sponsor's  income
   following a calculation based upon the limited evidence available, namely
   the 24 payslips, and upon his own calculations from  the  sponsor's  bank
   statements. There has been no challenge to the judge's findings in  those
   paragraphs or to his calculations from the bank statements. It is  plain,
   therefore, that even without considering the requirements  for  specified
   evidence, the appellant had failed  to  show  that  the  sponsor's  gross
   annual income at the  time  of  his  application  reached  the  financial
   threshold of �18,000. That was the judge's finding and in that he did not
   err in law.

15. Where the judge plainly did err in law, however,  is  in  accepting  the
   evidence of the �2000 award as demonstrating  that  the  sponsor's  gross
   annual income met the required threshold. Aside from the requirements  of
   the rules relating to specified evidence, that evidence  was  simply  not
   before the ECO or the ECM and indeed was not even  in  existence  at  the
   date of the decision. The document from ACAS  providing  details  of  the
   settlement confirm the date of settlement as being 2  April  2013,  which
   post-dated  the  refusal  of  entry  clearance  by   some   two   months.
   Furthermore, whilst Mr Rees submitted that the  �2000  award  related  to
   unpaid salary, there is no evidence that that was the case.  It  was  his
   submission that the sponsor had instigated legal proceedings against  her
   employer for unfair dismissal as a result of  being  summarily  dismissed
   owing to her pregnancy. Accordingly it is not apparent, and certainly not
   from the evidence available, that the award of �2000  represented  unpaid
   salary. It is submitted on behalf of the sponsor that her employer was  a
   rogue employer, but that was not a finding made by the judge or confirmed
   by any evidence other than the fact that a dispute was resolved by way of
   settlement.

16. It was Mr Rees' submission that  section  D(d)  of  Appendix  FM-SE  was
   applicable in that the ECO ought to have contacted  the  sponsor  in  the
   light of the limited evidence.  However  I  do  not  consider  that  that
   assists the appellant's case given that the missing payslips had not been
   omitted by an oversight but did not exist. In any event the  ECM  clearly
   went on to consider the  application  outside  the  requirements  of  the
   specified evidence and  made  his  own  calculation  from  the  available
   documents, reaching a figure for gross annual income which  was  accepted
   by the judge on the basis of his own calculations from the sponsor's bank
   statements.

17. Neither do I find any merit in Mr Rees' submission as  to  the  exercise
   of discretion under section  D(e).  Such  a  submission  is  clearly  not
   relevant to the issue of error of law, as it was not the basis upon which
   the judge allowed the appeal. In any event, it is clear that the  sponsor
   had no further documentation at all to confirm her  claim  of  an  annual
   salary of above �18,000 and the evidence confirming the deposits  of  her
   salary into her bank account were calculated by the judge as being  below
   the required financial threshold. I find no merit in the suggestion  that
   the sponsor could have explained the impending legal proceedings  to  the
   ECO had she been contacted. She did not mention that in  her  grounds  of
   appeal and in  any  event,  as  Ms  Isherwood  submitted,  there  was  no
   certainty that she would have been successful in her claim.

18. In all of the circumstances I find that the judge  materially  erred  in
   law by taking into account, in calculating the sponsor's  annual  income,
   the �2000 award. His comment at paragraph 6 of  his  determination  about
   her earning capacity demonstrated by her current  employment  is  clearly
   not relevant to the  respondent's  decision.  On  the  evidence  properly
   accepted by the judge at paragraphs 4 and 5 of his  determination  it  is
   clear that the appellant could not meet the requirements  of  the  rules.
   Accordingly I set aside his  decision  to  allow  the  appeal  under  the
   immigration rules.

19. I see no reason why  the  decision  ought  not  to  be  re-made  on  the
   evidence before me by dismissing the appeal on the basis of  the  reasons
   already set out above. There was no indication before me of  any  further
   evidence  to  assist  the  appellant.  All  the  financial  evidence  was
   available before the First-tier Tribunal  and,  as  already  stated,  the
   judge properly found that  it  demonstrated  that  the  sponsor's  annual
   income fell short of the required level, irrespective  of  considerations
   of the appellant's  inability  to  meet  the  requirements  of  specified
   evidence under Appendix FM-SE. Accordingly, the respondent's decision  to
   refuse the application under paragraphs EC-P.1.1(d) and E-ECP.3.1 was  in
   accordance with the law and the immigration   rules  and  the  appeal  is
   dismissed under the immigration rules.

20. With regard to Article 8, it is the case,  as  Ms  Isherwood  submitted,
   that Article 8  has  never  been  raised  either  before  the  First-tier
   Tribunal or the Upper Tribunal. Indeed, Mr Rees confirmed that the appeal
   was pursued solely under the immigration rules. I  note  that  the  ECM's
   observation, that the appellant and sponsor were  living  together  at  a
   time when he had no permission to be in the United Kingdom, is  confirmed
   in the sponsor's own letter. Accordingly, in terms of the  principles  in
   Nagre, Gulshan and Shahzad,  there  are  no  arguably  good  grounds  for
   considering Article 8 outside the rules. It is open to the  appellant  to
   make a fresh  application  with  the  benefit  of  the  evidence  of  the
   sponsor's current employment.

DECISION

21. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved an  error
   on a point of law. The Entry Clearance Officer's  appeal  is  accordingly
   allowed and the decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.  I  re-
   make the decision by dismissing Mr Cheklat's appeal on all grounds.
