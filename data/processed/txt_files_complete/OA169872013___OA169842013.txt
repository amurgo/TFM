Representation

For the Appellants:    Mr O Agbaje-Williams, solicitor (C&A Solicitors)
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The appellants are mother and daughter, born on 1st December 1984  and
      1st June 2006. They are nationals of Somalia.  They  appealed  against
      the respondent's decisions dated 30th July 2013 and 22nd January  2014
      to refuse to grant them entry clearance to come to the UK as the  wife
      and daughter respectively of Mr Mahmud Hussein Jama (the sponsor)  who
      now has indefinite leave to remain in the UK.


   2. Their appeals were dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge Malins in  a
      determination promulgated on 25th April 2014 that "by a  wide  margin"
      it was clear on the figures given  to  the  respondent  and  from  the
      sponsor's own  figures  that  his  income  fell  substantially  short,
      probably by nearly �7,000, of the income required to  be  shown.  When
      his second child is born, the gap to be bridged would be  even  wider.
      She found that the arrival of the two appellants in the UK would  lead
      swiftly to recourse to public funds in the form  of  housing  benefit,
      working tax credit and child tax credit.


   3. Accordingly, the appellants failed to meet the financial requirements.
      The Judge was however satisfied as to the subsistence and  genuineness
      of the marriage.


   4. On 6th June  2014,  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Simpson  granted  the
      appellants permission to appeal. It had been contended that the  Judge
      failed to make a clear  finding  on  the  marriage  certificate;  that
      having found that her sponsor had been a  settled  person  in  the  UK
      since January 2011, the Judge failed to apply paragraph  A280  to  the
      minor appellant's application or to  consider  her  application  under
      paragraph 297, where only  "adequate  maintenance  and  accommodation"
      requirements apply.  In  addition,  the  Judge  failed  to  apply  the
      decision of MM and Others v SSHD to the first appellant's application:
      That decision has now been reversed by the Court  of  Appeal  and  the
      financial requirements in the rules have been upheld.


   5. It is also contended that the Judge failed to follow the decisions  of
      ZH (Tanzania) and LD (Zimbabwe) or to apply the requirements  of  s.55
      of the 2009 Act when dealing with the best interests of the child.


   6. Judge  Simpson  without  any  analysis  decided  that  although  these
      applications were made after 9th July 2012, given that  the  child  is
      the sponsor's daughter and given that her application was  made  after
      he obtained a settled status in January 2011, paragraph  A280  applies
      so that the minor appellant's decision ought to have  been  considered
      under paragraph 297. Accordingly, it was arguable that the sponsor did
      not need to show an income of �22,400 but only �18,600.


         The background to the appeal


   7. The sponsor came to the UK in August 2005 and  claimed  asylum,  which
      was refused. He did not leave the UK and on  16th  February  2011  was
      granted indefinite leave to remain under  the  Legacy  scheme  on  the
      basis of five and a half years' residence in the UK.


   8. He had married the first appellant on 11th January  2005  in  Ethiopia
      and has one child, the second appellant,  born  in  Somalia.  She  was
      pregnant with a second child.


   9. The appellants made their applications for visas  on  18th  May  2013.
      They stated that they would live with the sponsor in a  property  that
      he rents in Enfield. The first appellant claimed to be exempt from the
      English language test as there was no centre in her home town.


  10. The respondent refused their applications on 29th July 2013 as he  was
      not satisfied that the marriage certificate was genuine, or that their
      relationship was genuine and subsisting.  No  determination  had  been
      made on the question of the main income requirement to  be  met  under
      the relevant immigration rules.


  11. On 22nd January 2014, the respondent issued a revised refusal of entry
      clearance. The veracity of the marriage certificate  was  rejected  on
      the basis of a document verification report. Further,  the  respondent
      was  not  satisfied  that  theirs  was  a   genuine   and   subsisting
      relationship. Nor was there evidence that the second appellant was the
      daughter of the sponsor.


  12. The sponsor had been unable to satisfy the income requirement  showing
      �22,400 per annum. He had two jobs  and  the  second  employment  only
      commenced two months before the date of the application  and  thus  he
      could not adequately make  up  the  financial  deficit  of  the  first
      employment under the provisions of the rules.


  13. A DNA report was obtained showing that the second  appellant  was  the
      child of the first appellant and the sponsor.


  14. The Judge found that the sponsor did come  here  in  2006  to  make  a
      better life. He left behind two wives. The second was  newly  pregnant
      with their child, who is now the second appellant. He was only able to
      see his child for the first time when she was six years old  after  he
      obtained indefinite leave to remain. As noted, the  Judge  found  that
      they were in a subsisting relationship.


  15. She found that insofar as the marriage certificate is  concerned,  any
      finding of the veracity of the document is difficult in  view  of  the
      general situation regarding record keeping and societal structures  in
      Somalia and Ethiopia. In any event  the  matter  is  academic  as  the
      sponsor could have sponsored the appellant as an unmarried partner  if
      the relationship met certain criteria.


  16.  With  regard  to  the  "financial  regulations  applicable   in   the
      immigration rules" she rejected the  'credibility'  of  the  sponsor's
      claimed income, finding that he  must  earn  substantially  below  the
      �22,400 that the appellants needed to show to comply with the relevant
      requirements.


  17. In the event, she found that the sponsor's income  fell  substantially
      short of the income required in order to sponsor the arrival in the UK
      of the appellants.






   Submissions


  18. At the hearing on the 31st July 2014 Mr Agbaje-Williams submitted that
      the Judge erred in failing to note that paragraph A280  of  the  Rules
      applies to the second appellant's appeal so that where an  application
      is being made by a child whose parent  is  settled  in  the  UK  under
      paragraph 297, the additional  requirements  of  Appendix  FM  do  not
      apply.


  19. He submitted that at no point did the Judge consider the  transitional
      provisions at paragraph A280. If that had been done it would have been
      clear that the child had applied in  her  own  right  and  had  to  be
      considered as such under paragraph 297 rather than  Appendix  FM.  Her
      father had been settled two years  before.  She  stated  that  she  is
      travelling unaccompanied and is  applying  as  a  child  of  a  parent
      settled in the UK.


  20. Mr Agbaje-Williams referred to pages 160 and 161 of  the  respondent's
      bundle where the child is said to have stated that she  is  travelling
      unaccompanied. However, at page 160 it is simply stated on  behalf  of
      the second appellant that she is continuously asking her  mother  when
      they are going to her father. I note that at page 152,  the  appellant
      has put a cross next to "financial requirement" that is required to be
      met. The income is stated to be at least �22,400 a year.


  21. She has also ticked the box relating to the basis upon  which  she  is
      going to the UK. She stated that she is going to the UK as  the  child
      of a parent who is applying for entry clearance as a partner,  or  the
      child who is applying to join their parent who is already  in  the  UK
      and has been granted  limited  leave  as  partner  granted  under  the
      Immigration Rules in force on 9th July 2012.


  22. Mr Agbaje-Williams submitted that given  the  facts  set  out  in  the
      application and by Judge Malins, the second appellant was not applying
      or seeking limited leave as a dependant of a parent or  parents  given
      limited leave. He submitted that under paragraph 297 the  child  "gets
      settlement immediately."


  23. Unlike a child applicant, no spouse  who  applies  for  settlement  is
      granted settlement in the UK immediately. Where the mother  or  spouse
      succeeds under the rules, she is always granted limited leave  for  30
      months to start with. To suggest that the child applying at  the  same
      time, travelling unaccompanied, must  be  considered  under  paragraph
      301, as is contended  by the  respondent  in  the  rule  24  response,
      rather than paragraph 297,  would  be  wrong.  That  would  mean  that
      paragraph 297 is 'otiose, contrary to the intention of  the  Secretary
      of State in providing paragraph A280 for applications made  after  9th
      July 2012 by a child'.


  24. Had the Judge considered and applied paragraph A280 and then paragraph
      297, as the maintenance and accommodation requirements had been met on
      the evidence before her, even for two adults and the second appellant,
      their appeals would not have been dismissed, and  in  the  worst  case
      scenario the second appellant's appeal would have  been  allowed.  The
      Tribunal should therefore allow the appellants' appeals, "or at  worst
      appellant Hamada Hussein's appeal."


  25. Further, the Judge failed to apply ZH (Tanzania) or  to  consider  the
      "then case of MM and Others v SSHD". The best interests of  the  child
      are a primary consideration. Her application succeeds under  paragraph
      297 of the rules as her father was settled in 2011 and he had both the
      income and accommodation to ensure  her  application  succeeded  under
      that paragraph. To suggest that as her mother can only ever be granted
      limited leave  of  30  months  under  Appendix  FM,  that  the  second
      appellant must only succeed via Rule 201, would be wrong  in  law  and
      not in the child's best interests.  That  is  in  part  because  under
      paragraph 301, the child would only get limited leave which is not  in
      her best interests whereas under paragraph 297,  she  gets  indefinite
      leave.


  26. The best interests of the child cannot be safeguarded or  promoted  by
      seeking to make the appellant make two  applications,  one  under  301
      plus Appendix FM and a later one under paragraph  298  where  she  can
      only succeed if her mother also gets settlement or dies  so  that  the
      father  has  sole  responsibility.  The  child's  best  interests  are
      accordingly served by applying Rule 297 to her appeal (paragraph 15 of
      the skeleton argument).


  27. Mr Agbaje-Williams accepted in his  oral  submissions  that  the  only
      evidence was that the sponsor earned about �13,000. The  child  should
      nevertheless succeed and he relied on Article  8  in  respect  of  the
      mother's claim.


  28. On behalf of  the  respondent,  Mr  Avery  submitted  that  the  whole
      argument was based on a false premise. The  contention  was  that  the
      second  appellant's  application  should  have  been  treated  as   an
      application under 297 having regard to the transitional provisions.


  29. He submitted however that it has not been explained how she manages to
      come within it.  Paragraph 297 sets out the requirements to be met  by
      a person seeking indefinite leave to enter the UK as the  child  of  a
      parent, parents or a relative present and settled  or  being  admitted
      for settlement in the UK. The first set of requirements relates  to  a
      child seeking leave to enter or accompany or join a parent, parents or
      a relative in the UK in one of the circumstances set out in  paragraph
      (a) to (f) of paragraph (i).


  30. Paragraph 297(i)(a) refers to both parents being present  and  settled
      in the UK. That does not apply, nor does sub paragraph  (b)  apply  as
      both  parents  are  not  being  admitted  on  the  same  occasion  for
      settlement. Paragraph (c) does not apply as  although  one  parent  is
      present and settled in the UK, the other is not being admitted on  the
      same occasion for settlement.


  31. Nor does sub paragraph (d) apply as the other parent is not dead.  Nor
      does sub paragraph (e) apply as the parent present and settled in  the
      UK has not had sole responsibility for the child's upbringing. Nor are
      there any serious or compelling family or other  considerations  which
      makes the child's exclusion undesirable.


  32. He submitted that paragraph 301 of the rules apply to her situation as
      her father is not seeking settlement. Accordingly she cannot meet  the
      requirements under the rules. She would thus not  have  been  admitted
      under paragraph 297 and accordingly FM applies.


  33. He submitted that the decision in MM in the Court of Appeal has  found
      that the immigration rules are 'reasonable'.


  34. There is nothing, moreover, to suggest that this is a case in which it
      would be appropriate to go outside the rules for Article 8 purposes as
      there are no compelling or exceptional circumstances that apply.  This
      is a standard entry clearance application.


  35. Insofar as s.55 is concerned, the child is being looked after  by  her
      mother. There are no  compelling  circumstances  why  her  application
      should be treated outside the rules.


     Assessment


  36. It was submitted on behalf of the appellants that the  issue  for  the
      First-tier Tribunal Judge had  been  whether  the  second  appellant's
      appeal should have been decided under Appendix FM of  the  Immigration
      Rules. It is contended that if she should have been allowed  to  enter
      the UK for settlement pursuant to paragraph  297  of  the  rules,  her
      mother's appeal would also have been allowed under Article 8.


  37. It is accepted that the mother's application was  properly  considered
      under Appendix FM and that the financial requirements cannot be met.


  38. The submission is that the Judge failed to note that paragraph A280 of
      the rules applied to the second appellant's appeal. That is because it
      provides that where an application is made by a child whose parent  is
      settled in the UK under paragraph 297 the additional  requirements  of
      Appendix FM do not apply. The contention is that the second  appellant
      had applied in her own right and had to be considered  as  such  under
      paragraph 297.


  39. I have had regard to the provisions of paragraph 297. The requirements
      to be met by a person seeking indefinite leave to enter the UK as  the
      child of a parent present and settled or being admitted for settlement
      in the UK are set out in paragraph 297(i)(a) to (f), to which  I  have
      already referred.


  40. I am  satisfied  that  none  of  the  potentially  applicable  factual
      scenarios set out in paragraph 297 (i)(a) to (f) applies to the second
      appellant. I accordingly agree with the submission of  Mr  Avery  that
      the argument on behalf of the appellants is based on a  false  set  of
      premises.


  41. Accordingly, the income requirement  under  Appendix  FM  would  still
      apply to the second appellant as she is seeking to enter the UK at the
      same time  that  her  mother  seeks  limited  leave  with  a  view  to
      settlement as set out at paragraph 301 of the rules.






  42. Paragraph 301 does not fall within any of the paragraphs  referred  to
      in A280. Accordingly, the income requirements under paragraph FM still
      apply.






  43. I have had regard to the findings and conclusions  of  the  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge relating to the financial requirements.  Based  on  the
      available information there was no satisfactory evidence that  in  the
      12 months prior to the application, the sponsor had received the level
      of income required to meet the financial requirements.






  44. It is evident that the First-tier Tribunal Judge  did  not  separately
      consider the issue raised  under  s.55  as  a  primary  consideration.
      There was only a fleeting reference to Article 8  in  the  grounds  of
      appeal, amongst others such as Articles 12  and  14  and  the  related
      protocols.






  45. Mr Agbaje Williams also relied on the authority as it then was  in  MM
      [2013] EWHC 1900 as read with Gulshan [2013] UKUT 640. That is because
      the child's best interests fall to be determined under paragraph  297,
      and there were and are good reasons for  granting  leave  outside  the
      rules pursuant to Article 8.






  46. However, given that  paragraph  297  does  not  apply  to  the  second
      appellant, I find that it has not been shown that there are compelling
      reasons for Article 8 purposes to consider  the  appeals  pursuant  to
      Article 8. MM  and  Others,  as  noted,  has  been  reversed  and  the
      financial requirements have been upheld.


  47. These appellants' applications are similar to other appellants seeking
      entry clearance under FM of the rules.






  48. Moreover, pending the outcome  of  a  further  application  under  the
      rules, the sponsor, who has visited Ethiopia to see the appellants  on
      two occasions since obtaining indefinite leave to remain, both in 2012
      and 2013, has the opportunity of visiting them there  again.  Although
      there is no evidence as to how long it would take for a decision to be
      made  after  the  submission  of  an  application,  I  note  that  the
      respondent gave a decision at the  end  of  July  2013  following  the
      applications made on 18th May 2013.






  49. I accordingly find  that  although  the  Judge  erred  in  failing  to
      consider the s.55 best interests of the child and Article 8, this  did
      not in the circumstances constitute a material error.






     Decision





  50. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  did  not  involve  the
      making of any material errors of law. It shall consequently stand.
