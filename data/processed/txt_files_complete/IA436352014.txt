                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born on 30 September 1992 and  on
    14 June 2014 she applied for a residence card as  confirmation  of  her
    right to reside in the UK under  Regulation  8(5)  of  the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2206 ("EEA  Regulations")  on  the
    basis that she was an extended family member of Namir Soilihi, a French
    national, and thus in a durable relationship with an EEA national.

 2. That application was refused on 8 September  2014.   The  Secretary  of
    State stated that she expected the appellant  to  demonstrate  she  had
    been living together with her EEA national in a subsisting and  durable
    relationship for an acceptable period of time and this was normally two
    years.  The appellant provided various documents dating  from  2012  to
    present date but they only showed evidence that  the  EEA  sponsor  had
    resided with her since 2013 and this evidence was also limited and  was
    not from several various sources.  All other evidence was addressed  to
    the appellant herself and did not demonstrate cohabitation.

 3. The appellant provided two tenancy agreements  but  the  issuing  party
    authority could not be appropriately verified and there was no way  for
    the respondent to verify whether the  documents  had  been  altered  or
    tampered with or produced for the  purpose  of  the  application  of  a
    residence card.

 4. The tenancy agreement was dated 2 January 2012 until  29  October  2012
    but it was not consider evidence  of  a  relationship  as  the  tenancy
    agreement had not been authenticated by the issuing party as accurate.

 5. Further, on 6 April 2007 a legal requirement was placed on landlords to
    hold deposits taken as a result of shorthold tenancy agreements  within
    the government endorsed tenancy deposit protection.  There was no  such
    tenancy protection document.  There was a lack of  evidence  that  they
    were in a durable relationship.

 6. There was also a lack of evidence that the EEA sponsor  was  exercising
    treaty rights as a worker.  He had provided a wage slip  for  May  2014
    and an employer contract dated 1 May 2014 from the Institute  of  Small
    Business Management but the Secretary of State had  undertaken  various
    checks to verify the employment but has been unable to do so and  there
    was no trace of the EEA  family  member's  employment  for  the  stated
    period for this claimed employer.

 7. The department contacted the claimed employer by telephone on 5  August
    2014 at the Institute of Small Business Management, First Floor,  21-23
    Woodgrange Road Limited, E7 0BA (Telephone No: 0208 522 1565).  A  male
    claiming to be the manager of the company stated that the  EEA  sponsor
    worked for the company and provided all relevant details regarding your
    sponsor's start date and job title - insurance number.

 8. Following the telephone  calls  the  respondent  conducted  interagency
    checks which confirmed that there were no employment or self-employment
    records held regarding the EEA sponsor's employment in the UK.

 9. From this evidence gained it was clear that the  EEA  national  sponsor
    was not exercising treaty rights in the United Kingdom as a worker.

10. The appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge  J.D.L.  Edwards  and
    was determined on the  papers  on  14  March  2015.   He  set  out  the
    following:

         "Evidence

         12.  The gravamen  of  this  case  is  whether  the  appellant  has
             established that she has been in a durable  relationship  with
             the sponsor for a period of two years.  To  support  this  she
             has produced a number of documents.   There  are  two  tenancy
             agreements in joint names.  Further it is suggested  that  the
             sponsor is not exercising employment rights, because when  the
             respondent  sought  to  verify  the   claims   made   in   the
             application, there were no official records to show employment
             or self-employment.

         13.  In her statement the  appellant  says,  in  effect,  that  the
             material submitted is enough  to  justify  the  grant  of  the
             residence card.  The sponsor in a statement does  not  comment
             on the absence of records of his employment.

         Findings

         14.  I remind myself that the onus of proof in this case rests with
             the  appellant  to  the  civil  standard  of  a   balance   of
             probabilities.  I  have  considered  the  written  submissions
             lodged by the appellant's solicitors.

         15.  For this to be regarded as a durable relationship,  there  has
             to be evidence.  There is very little  by  way  of  acceptable
             documentation to show that that is the case.   Only  one  bank
             statement is in joint names, and is dated September 2014, that
             is after the date of application.  The tenancy agreements  are
             not in the appropriate form.

         16.  I therefore find that the appellant has not produced  adequate
             evidence to establish that she is in  a  durable  relationship
             with the sponsor within the meaning of the Regulations.

         Conclusions

         17.  I therefore conclude that the appellant has not placed  before
             me sufficient credible evidence to show  to  the  standard  of
             proof required of appellants  in  these  cases  that  she  has
             satisfied all  the  requirements  of  the  Regulations  and  I
             dismiss the appeal."

11. An application for permission to appeal was made on the basis that  the
    judge erred in law in finding  at  paragraph  12  that  there  were  no
    official records to show employment or self-employment as the appellant
    submitted documents to show his spouse was self-employed.

12. The judge also erred in not  requesting  the  Home  Office  to  produce
    evidence of the check they carried out regarding the employment or self-
    employment of the appellant's spouse.

13. The judge erred in determining there was little by  way  of  acceptable
    documentation to show a durable relationship and did  not  give  enough
    weight to the documentation produced.

14. The judge erred in suggesting that the tenancy agreement was not in the
    appropriate form and it was not set out what  appropriate  form  really
    meant.

15. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Osborne on  the
    basis that it was arguable the judge's findings were not  supported  by
    adequate reasons  and  the  documentary  evidence  was  not  adequately
    considered by the judge.

The Hearing

16. At the hearing Mr Iqbal pointed  out  that  the  judge  had  mistakenly
    considered  that  Regulation  17(1)  instead  of  17(4)  of   the   EEA
    Regulations applied.  Mr Iqbal relied  on  the  written  permission  to
    appeal application.  He looked through the tenancy agreement and  there
    was no reference to any deposit and such  tenancy  agreement  would  be
    valid.

17. Secondly, in relation to the treaty rights, the interagency checks were
    not disclosed in accordance with MH (Respondent's bundle: documents not
    provided) Pakistan [2010] UKUT 168 (IAC) and if the respondent referred
    to and relied on that document it should be disclosed.

18. Mr Tufan agreed that the findings of the judge were not  extensive  but
    he considered that they were sufficient.

19. I found that there was an error of law in the determination.  The judge
    had not engaged with the evidence which ran to 163 pages  and  even  if
    all of that evidence were not relevant the judge should have  addressed
    the  relevant  evidence  which  related  to  independent  documentation
    relating to co-habitation.

20. Further, there was no finding as to whether the  EEA  national  was  in
    fact exercising treaty rights.

21. Mr Iqbal and Mr Tufan were content to  proceed  on  the  basis  of  the
    documentary evidence available to me and Mr Tufan made no objection  to
    the production of further documentary evidence at  the  hearing  which,
    although was not in accordance with Rule 15(2) of  the  Upper  Tribunal
    Procedure Rules was admitted.  I note that directions were sent out  by
    the Tribunal on 5 August 2015 directing the parties to  file  with  the
    Tribunal and serve upon the other party  any  documentary  evidence  on
    which it was relied  even  if  that  had  been  previously  served.   A
    reminder of that direction was issued on 27  August  2015  following  a
    refusal to adjourn the hearing of 7 September 2015 on  the  basis  that
    the appellant's spouse had left the country.  The parties were reminded
    that any further documentary statements could be served  and  stand  as
    evidence-in-chief.  I therefore proceeded on the basis of the  evidence
    before me.

22. Ms Oshodin attended court and  adopted  her  statement.   Under  cross-
    examination she first stated that just she and her partner lived at  42
    [ - ] and then stated someone called Ahmadi did stay there from a month
    ago (the hearing was 7th September 2015).  When challenged by Mr Tufan,
    she stated that in fact Ahmadi was her sister and arrived  in  February
    2015 and left on 15 August 2015, therefore she left a month ago.

23. Mr Tufan made mention of an Immigration Officer's visit to the property
    when only her older sister was there.  The appellant asserted that  her
    sister in when her partner was not there.  The appellant confirmed that
    she was aware that  the  EEA  national  sponsor  had  made  a  previous
    application for a residence certificate which had been refused and that
    there was no appeal.

24. She confirmed the partner was now self-employed as  a  barber  and  had
    paid tax of �20 on 6 September 2015  which  was  yesterday.   The  full
    amount due was �212 and the last date it was due was  in  January  2016
    but they thought they would get it out of the  way.   She  stated  that
    this was arrears.  She confirmed her partner earned �800 per month.  He
    worked house to house and the business was advertised by word of mouth.
     Mr Tufan submitted that the signature of the sponsor was different  on
    the application and the tenancy agreement.

25. She was asked whether there was a tax return and she stated that it was
    made on line but she forgot to print it out.  She confirmed  on  a  re-
    examination that she had seen her partner submit tax  returns  and  she
    was beside him and she confirmed that he submitted his  tax  return  in
    February 2015 for the period 2014 to  2015.   She  confirmed  that  her
    partner made the national insurance contributions  to  the  bank.   She
    also confirmed that she was aware that the tax year started  and  ended
    in April.

26. Mr Tufan made submissions that the appellant had changed her  evidence.
    Her evidence was discrepant and she was not in a durable  relationship.
    There was inadequate evidence of  him  staying  there.   There  was  no
    council tax being paid.

27. Secondly, there was no evidence that he was in fact  exercising  treaty
    rights and no evidence of earnings having gone into a bank account.

28. The appellant confirmed that the last time the  sponsor  had  contacted
    her was on 1 August because there were difficulties with the internet.

29. Mr  Iqbal  made  submissions  that  the  appellant  was  in  a  durable
    relationship and mentioned that the sister came and went which was  not
    unusual.  The doubt about the visit was not reflected  in  the  reasons
    for refusal letter but Mr Tufan pointed out that this was  because  the
    visit was dated 22 September 2014  which  post-dated  the  reasons  for
    refusal.  Mr Iqbal submitted that the appellant was expressive and  not
    evasive.  She said that she had sent her originals to the Home  Office.
    A landlord's statement was not produced or required and no  interagency
    checks of the evidential material was produced.   There  was  a  recent
    payment to HMRC which gave support to the fact  that  the  sponsor  was
    exercising treaty rights.

Conclusions

30. As I found an error of law I proceeded  to  determine  the  two  issues
    which were live in this case, the  first  being  whether  there  was  a
    durable relationship  and  the  second  was  whether  the  sponsor  was
    exercising treaty rights.

31. There is no doubt that the documentation places both the appellant  and
    the EEA national at 42 [ - ], DA8 [ - ].  I can also see that there are
    on file a tenancy agreements dated 2 January 2012 between Rob  Williams
    and the appellant and the sponsor and also one dated  29  October  2012
    between Collins Roberts and the sponsor and appellant,

32. The question is whether there is a genuine and subsisting  relationship
    between the appellant and the sponsor and I do not  accept  that  there
    is.  I found the appellant's evidence to be evasive and shifting.  When
    she was first asked under cross examination whether anyone  else  lived
    at the property with her she stated  that  it  was  just  her  and  her
    partner.  It then transpired that the sister had been staying with  her
    and she stated  that  her  sister  came  to  stay  with  her  when  the
    appellant's sponsor was not there.  At first she stated that her sister
    came in August.  Then the appellant stated, when challenged and  during
    cross-examination, that her sister had in fact  come  between  February
    and August and then when it was put to the  appellant  that  there  had
    been an immigration office check in September 2014 that the sister  had
    answered the door, the appellant asserted that the  sister  stayed  'on
    and off'.  I make no mention of the question  as  to  whether  the  EEA
    national lived there but I do find that this shows that the appellant's
    evidence was contradictory.  I find that in fact the sister lives  with
    the appellant which leads me to find that the appellant was not  candid
    about who lived there and not candid about her  relationship  with  the
    EEA national.

33. The only statement given by the EEA national was a short five paragraph
    statement sworn on 2 March 2015 merely stating that he had been  living
    with the appellant in a relationship akin to marriage for two years and
    that "I confirm that we love each other and  are  planning  on  getting
    married soon and starting a family".

34. If that were the case and he knew that his partner's immigration status
    was in jeopardy I do not accept that he would leave for  Nairobi  on  1
    August (permission to appeal was granted on 21 May 2015) and  secondly,
    that even if he had to go to Nairobi that he would not have submitted a
    further  statement  rather  than  the  bare  assertions  and  formulaic
    statement he submitted.

35. Thirdly, the appellant during her evidence stated that she  last  heard
    from her claimed partner before he went to Nairobi and  that  they  had
    not been in contact because the internet was poor.  As pointed  out  in
    the reasons for refusing the adjournment, the Air France ticket was not
    clear as to the date of departure and the appellant could  not  produce
    any further evidence of her claimed partner's  travels.   If  she  were
    truly in a romantic relationship with this man I do not accept that  he
    would leave the country for this length of time  without  offering  her
    further assistance and support and would not have been in any  form  of
    contact with her since the start of August.

36. I do note that the appellant would appear to have  access  to  the  EEA
    sponsor's tax documentation and his UTR number and  that  there  was  a
    notice to complete a tax return from HMRC dated 6  April  2015  to  the
    appellant's sponsor.  That said,  no  tax  return  was  produced.   The
    appellant stated that she was with the sponsor when he  filled  in  the
    tax return on line but she forgot to print it out.  She claims that the
    tax due was �212.  The fact is that the appellant also claimed that the
    tax return was made in February 2015.  As the tax year does  not  close
    until April 2015, a fact that she was aware of, I  do  not  accept  her
    evidence that she was with him when he made the tax return as the dates
    for returns are adrift.  I find that there is insufficient evidence  to
    show that the  sponsor  is  currently  self-employed.   There  were  no
    invoices.  I considered the bank statements and it was clear  that  the
    payments made into the Barclays joint account in August were  deposited
    by Ms Oshodin, at least they derived from her account.

37. I take note that the appellant and her sponsor did have  a  joint  bank
    account together but from the evidence supplied to me it is clear  that
    as from 17 September 2014 Barclays Bank closed  both  accounts  of  the
    appellant and the joint account  of  the  appellant  and  the  sponsor.
    These accounts were therefore closed on 17 September 2014.  What  might
    have seemed to have evidenced a relationship between the appellant  and
    sponsor clearly no longer existed.

38. I am not persuaded that the national insurance contributions made on  5
    May 2015 are evidence that the appellant's sponsor made those payments.

39. I have reviewed all of the documentary evidence  provided  and  in  the
    context of the oral evidence.  There are features  which  suggest  that
    the sponsor is not longer conducting his own affairs at  that  address.
    The account from Vodaphone in October 2014 showed  that  there  was  an
    outstanding debt in the Sponsor's name.  His bank account with Barclays
    was closed in September 2014.   As  the  appellant  confirmed  she  had
    access to his very limited tax affairs and the sponsor's  documents,  I
    conclude that she was able to pay the utility bills as she paid his tax
    bill. In 2014 the Sky account was in the Sponsor's  name  but  by  14th
    August 2014 the account was in the appellant's name. From  the  Lloyd's
    Bank account I can accept that the appellant does live at 42 [ - ], and
    the sponsor has also been identified as having lived there in the past,
    but bearing in mind the very limited  extent  and  the  nature  of  the
    documentary evidence provided,  I do not find  this  shows  him  to  be
    exercising treaty rights.  I do not accept that they are in an intimate
    relationship Indeed he is not even in the country and on this aspect of
    the case I comment above and enlist those findings here.   It is  clear
    that the appellant has access to the sponsor's documentation and  I  am
    not persuaded that he has himself paid the bills to the HMRC.

40. The Judge erred materially for the reasons identified.  I set aside the
    decision pursuant to Section  12(2)(a)  of  the  Tribunals  Courts  and
    Enforcement Act 2007 (TCE 2007) and remake the decision  under  section
    12(2) (b) (ii) of the TCE 2007

41. I therefore dismiss the appeal.
