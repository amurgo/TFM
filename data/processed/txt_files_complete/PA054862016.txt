Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr M Diwyncz, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

For the Respondent:    Ms E Fitzsimons, instructed by Migrant Legal Project
(Cardiff)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 (SI 2008/2698) I  make  an  anonymity  order.   Unless  the  Upper
    Tribunal or court directs otherwise, no  report  of  these  proceedings
    shall directly  or  indirectly  identify  the  appellant  (SKH).   This
    direction applies to both the appellant (SKH) and to the respondent and
    a failure to comply with this direction could lead to contempt of court
    proceedings.

 2. Although this is an appeal by the Secretary of State, for convenience I
    will refer to the  parties  as  they  appeared  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

Introduction

 3. The appellant is a citizen of Ethiopia who was born on [ ]  1986.   She
    entered the  United  Kingdom  on  1  October  2012  illegally  and  was
    arrested.  On 2 October  2012,  the  appellant  claimed  asylum.   That
    application was refused on 24 October 2012.  Her subsequent appeal  was
    dismissed by Judge  MacDonald  on  4  January  2013.   The  appellant's
    subsequent application for permission to appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal
    was refused on 28 February 2013 and she became appeal rights  exhausted
    on 6 March 2013.

 4. On 5 December 2015, the appellant  submitted  further  representations.
    These were treated as a fresh claim and on 13 May 2016 the Secretary of
    State  refused  the  appellant's  claims   for   asylum,   humanitarian
    protection and on human rights grounds.

The Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

 5. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  In a  determination
    promulgated on 11 January 2017, Judge Powell  allowed  the  appellant's
    appeal under the Refugee Convention and Art 3 of the ECHR.  He accepted
    that the appellant was wanted (and of interest to) the  authorities  in
    Ethiopia and would be at risk as a consequence.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

 6. The Secretary of  State  sought  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 7. Permission was initially refused by the First-tier Tribunal  but  on  3
    April 2017, the Upper Tribunal (UTJ  King)  granted  the  Secretary  of
    State permission to appeal.

 8. Thus, the appeal came before me.

Discussion

 9. Before Judge Powell, a crucial aspect of the appellant's  claim  was  a
    document which, it was contended, originated from the Ethiopian  police
    and had been  sent  to  her  mother  which  confirmed  the  appellant's
    detention and escape following her arrest as an OLF sympathiser.

10. It was argued before Judge Powell that, in  particular,  this  document
    was evidence not considered by Judge MacDonald  when  he  rejected  the
    appellant's account that she had been arrested and detained because  of
    her OLF association.

11. At para 40, the  judge  found  the  appellant's  account  of  how  this
    document had come into her possession not  to  be  credible.   He  said
    this:

         "40. However, I do not find the appellant's  account  of  how  this
             document came into her possession to be credible.  I  find  it
             wholly  incredible.  I  do  not  find  it  credible  that  the
             appellant would have engaged the agency of  Million  to  trace
             her mother in Ethiopia  without  seeking  further  information
             about her well  being  and  welfare,  which  would  reasonably
             include  finding  out   about   any   difficulties   she   was
             experiencing from the authorities  since  her  departure  from
             Ethiopia  and  without  establishing  an  effective  line   of
             communication with her mother. I do not find it credible  that
             her  mother  would  simply  hand  over  the  document  without
             providing a narrative dealing with the interest shown  to  her
             by the state before and  after  the  date  of  this  document.
             Million's evidence is  untested  but  his  short  note,  which
             serves the appellant as evidence  to  show  how  the  document
             reached her, is inconsistent with the appellant's evidence  of
             his involvement. The note also indicates that the existence of
             the document was known before Million went to Ethiopia because
             he refers to  bringing  the  agreed  document  back.  This  is
             inconsistent with the appellant's evidence."

12. Nevertheless, the appellant relied upon the report  of  an  expert,  Mr
    Schroder which included a verification that the Ethiopian state had  an
    interest in the appellant.  Mr Schroder's  source  was  a  confidential
    source who confirmed that the appellant was a person of interest to the
    authorities; confirming that there was a file on the appellant and  the
    reference number on that file was the same as that on the document sent
    to her mother.

13. At paras 43-46, the judge considered the reliability of this  evidence,
    in particular the use of a confidential source and whether  there  was,
    in effect, any risk of collusion.  He said this:

         "43. I have already commented  on  Mr  Schroder's  explanation  for
             using a confidential source. His explanation is reasonable.  I
             accept that Mr Schroder recognises the  risks  in  relying  on
             confidential sources. The  confidential  source  provides  two
             important pieces of evidence. Firstly, that the appellant is a
             person of interest.  Secondly,  that  the  appellant's  file's
             reference number is the same number as appears in the document
             sent to her mother.

         44.  There is no suggestion that Mr Schroder is part of an  attempt
             to secure the appellant's status in  the  United  Kingdom.  As
             such, if the evidence provided  by  the  source  on  which  he
             relies is false, there must  have  been  a  link  between  the
             source and the appellant. I say this because Mr Schroder  only
             generated his inquiry of his  confidential  source  after  the
             document from her mother had been received.

         45.  It is for the appellant to prove to the required standard that
             the evidence from the  confidential  source  is  credible  and
             reliable. In this case, did the confidential source, whom  the
             appellant could not have known Mr Schroder would approach, lie
             about the existence of a file  and  lie  about  the  reference
             number in order to add  veracity  to  the  Ethiopian  document
             obtained from the  appellant's  mother?  An  official  may  be
             corrupt and open to bribery to generate  such  false  evidence
             but in this case I do not see how  this  could  have  occurred
             because the document in question came from the  appellant  and
             the verification from a confidential source in Ethiopia  whose
             identity was not known to the appellant.

         46.  In my judgment, notwithstanding my  findings  as  to  how  the
             document came to be in  the  appellant's  possession  and  the
             difficulties with its contents in the context of  the  absence
             of evidence or even a narrative from  her  mother  as  I  have
             described, I accept the verification obtained by Mr Schroder,
             and find that contrary to the findings made by Judge MacDonald
             in the absence of this new material, the appellant  has  shown
             to the  lower standard of  proof  that  she  is  a  person  of
             interest to the Ethiopian authorities."

14. In her grounds of appeal, the  Secretary  of  State  contends  that  in
    accepting the expert's report  and  what  was  said  in  it  about  the
    reliability of the document, the judge failed to apply the principle in
    Tanveer  Ahmed  ([2002]  Imm  AR  318)  and  failed  to  consider   its
    reliability in the context of all the evidence, including his  findings
    in relation to the credibility of aspects of the appellant's  evidence,
    such as the way in which she acquired the document.

15. In his submissions, Mr  Diwyncz  relied  upon  that  ground.   He  also
    submitted that there could be another individual with  the  appellant's
    name who might be involved in activities which  would  warrant  a  file
    being held  by  the  authorities,  in  particular  the  Federal  Police
    Commission ("FPC") in Ethiopia.  He also made  reference  to  the  fact
    that the private proceedings available to investigate forged  documents
    set out in s.108 of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002
    could have been  invoked  so  as  not  to  disclose  the  name  of  the
    informant.

16. Mr Schroder dealt with the genuineness of the documents at paras  76-82
    of his first report at pages 23-24 as follows:

             "Description

         76.  The document was viewed in the original at the office of Blavo
             Solicitors on 21 May 2014.It is of regular letter size with a
             bilingual header in English and  Amharic  on  the  left  upper
             side, a police commission logo in the middle  upper  side  and
             reference number and date on the right uppers side.  The  body
             of the text is followed by a signature and a stamp  indicating
             the issuing office and official. The document is stamped  with
             the seal of the Federal Police Commission.

         77.  The document is printed on a laser printer  including  header,
             footer, and main text body but the FPC seal and stamp with the
             name and office of the signing official had  been  stamped  on
             after printing. The date and the reference number  are  filled
             in by hand. Do-cuments of this type are becoming more and more
             common in Ethiopia.

             Assessment

         78.  As the matter under  consideration  is  an  alleged  political
             "crime", it is in line with current  Ethiopian  practice  that
             the FPC and not the Addis Ababa Police Commission carries  out
             the investigation.

         79.  The document corresponds in format  and  contents  to  similar
             police summons I have seen in Ethiopia during my lasts visits
             there 2012-2014:

             .    The terminology in the header is one of those used by the
                  FPC.

             .    The logo at the  top  of  the  document  is  one  of  the
                  currently used ones.

             .    The reference number  is  of  the  type  used  in  police
                  documents.

             .    The dates are properly stated in the Ethiopian Calendar.

             .    A confidential source in  the  head  office  of  the  FPC
                  confirmed in December 2014 that there exists in  the  head
                  office a file with this reference number under the name of
                  Sibila Kemal Hasen

             .    The seal on the document corresponds to one  of  the  FPC
                  seals used in the last years.

             .    The rank of the official is correctly given as a civilian
                  rank (Commander).

             .    The issuing department is one of the subunits of the  FPC
                  existing at the time the letter was  issued  and  handling
                  political matters.

             .    The official named as head of  this  unit  occupied  this
                  position at the time the letter was issued.

             .    The address in the letter makes the correct  use  of  the
                  new administrative units of Addis Abeba introduced in 2002
                  (Subcity) and 2010 (Wereda).

             .    The stilted language marked by convoluted and  very  long
                  sentences, which is employed in this  letter  is  in  line
                  with the bureaucratic language used in Ethiopian  official
                  documents.

         5    Conclusion

         80.  Format and contents of  the  document  correspond  to  genuine
             documents of this typeI have seen in Ethiopia or assessed.  It
             uses the correct logo, seal, administrative unit, office  name
             and rank and name of the official.

         81.  Many forgeries of such police letters are spotted because  the
             forgers  commit  substantial  errors  in  the  names  of   the
             officials serving at  the  time  the  letters  were  allegedly
             issued and/or in their titles and the names of  their  offices
             or in the administrative units of  Addis  Abeba  because  they
             were unable to follow up on changes related to these.  In this
             letter, names, titles and function correspond with the date of
             issuance, which strongly supports that this letter is genuine.



         82.  Therefore I find no  indication  that  this  document  is  not
             genuine. It is therefore my pro-fessional assessment that with
             a very high degree of certainty this document is genuine.   It
             confirms that the Ethiopian authorities are informed about the
             political activities of MTB in the UK."

17. The expert's view is clearly that the document is a genuine one for the
    reasons he gives.

18. Mr Schroder returned to the issue of the confidential source within the
    FPC in his second report at paras 43-45  at  pages  20-21  as  follows:



             "43....

             Source within the FPC

             Files of the FPC on suspects are not accessible to the public.
             It is only through personal contacts to officials of  the  FPC
             to obtain information whether  the  FPC  holds  a  file  on  a
             certain person or not. My contact within the FPC  regard  this
             matter was only willing to provide the information that such a
             file exists but not willing to divulge further details.  It is
             the  nature  of  confidential   sources   that   they   remain
             confidential. Especially in a country like Ethiopia  it  would
             be totally impossible to obtain any information  on  sensitive
             issues or official material not accessible to the public, if I
             were not to guard the anonymity of my sources  by  all  means.
             However, as the UKBA noted I am an accepted expert on Ethiopia
             and I have a professional reputation to protect. I would never
             pass on information, which I deem to be unreliable.

             I further want to stress that  the  FPC  does  not  deal  with
             regular criminal matters. It mainly deals  with  higher  level
             serious crimes at national or transregional level or political
             cases.  The fact that there is a file on SHK in the FPC can be
             taken as a sure indication that the file  deals  with  alleged
             political crimes of SHK as there is nothing  in  the  personal
             background of SHK that  she  is  a  common  criminal  of  high
             calibre warranting the attention of the FPC.

             FPC Official issuing the letter

             The Ethiopian government does not publish the appointments  to
             positions in the FPC.  Thus there  is  no  objective  evidence
             such as official  publications  on  the  positions  of  police
             officials to corroborate the position of this  official  named
             in the letter. Sometimes the names of officials are  mentioned
             in news items in the state media. However, in my report I have
             provided very detailed information on the officials in the FPC
             at various times (see especially �63). The  information  there
             provided on the staff of the FPC was collected over time since
             2009 from various confidential sources  including  the  former
             head of Public Affairs and  Communication  Department  of  the
             FPC, now living as an accepted refugee in the UK. The detailed
             information on the  FPC,  carefully  checked  and  re-checked,
             I presented in my previous report can be  taken  as  a  clear
             indication that  this  official  actually  held  the  position
             mentioned in the letter. A  sort  of  confirmation  that  Reta
             Tesfaye is a senior Federal police official is also proved  by
             an Ethiopian diaspora webseite, which has come to my attention
             recently.  22 Another  report  from  an  Ethiopian  opposition
             source probably dating from 2013 and which also has come to my
             attention recently, mentions  Reta  Tesfaye  as  well.  He  is
             described as an Oromo and

                  "Head of Federal Police  Investigations  for  the  Courts:
                  Commander Reta is close to the head of NISS mastermind  of
                  intelligence, Getachew Assefa. He is  also  in  charge  of
                  Maekelawi Prison where many of the prisoners are tortured.
                  He is loyal to the TPLF."23

             This report is biased as most oppositional website reports are
             but at least it confirms that this police official is a senior
             one involved in investigation.

              44. The statement of UKBA in � 26 of the RFRL that

                  "Mr. Schroder has not provided  any  evidence  to  support
                  this statement....the statements that he has made in  this
                  expert   report,    specifically    about    the    police
                  document...have not  been  corroborated  by  any  specific
                  source or evidence"

             in my professional opinion ignores the realities  in  Ethiopia
             and belittles my professional efforts in putting together  the
             assessment provided.

              45. If it would be possible to  confirm  positions  of  police
             officers or police documents from publicly accessible sources,
             there would not be need of an expert. Any researcher  of  UKBA
             or of a lawyer could search  out  this  information.  However,
             realities in Ethiopia are different and the information needed
             most certainly is not publicly accessible. Therefore an expert
             like myself, with background knowledge acquired  over  decades
             of  professional  diligent  research  work  undertaken  mostly
             although not  exclusively  during  frequent  re-search  period
             within  Ethiopia  and  who  has  reliable  confidential  local
             resources cultivated over years is called in  to  provide,  if
             possible, the needed information. In the absence  of  publicly
             accessible  information  on  the  document  in  question   the
             balanced  and  detailed  assessment  I provided  based  upon
             information in my possession and my sources is  professionally
             the best one possible under these circumstances."

19.  In  his  determination,  at  paras  43-46,  the  judge  excludes   the
    possibility of collusion between the  appellant  and  the  confidential
    source.  With respect, Mr Diwyncz's point that  there  may  be  another
    person with the appellant's name who happens to have a file held by the
    FPC is entirely speculative and fails to take into account that it  was
    not simply her name that linked the appellant to the file but also  the
    file number which was also on the letter she relied upon.

20. Mr Diwyncz's reference to s.108 of the NIA Act 2002 also, with respect,
    takes the Secretary of State's argument no further.   Even  bearing  in
    mind that it was not a matter raised before the judge, it would have no
    application to this case.  Section 108(1) sets out the circumstances in
    which a private inquiry by a judge may take place:

         "(1) This section applies where it is alleged -

             (a)  that a document relied on by a party to an  appeal  under
                  Section 82 ... is a forgery, and

             (b)  that disclosure to that party of a matter relating to the
                  detection of the forgery would be contrary to  the  public
                  interest."

21. Section 108(1)(b) contemplates the  situation  where  disclosure  of  a
    matter relating to the "detection of a forgery" would  be  contrary  to
    the public interest.  First, it is limited  to  disclosure  of  matters
    relating to the "detection" of forgery and,  secondly,  it  applies  to
    disclosure by the party not  relying  on  the  document  to  the  party
    relying upon it.  The provision is clearly intended to apply, and  does
    apply, when an appellant relies on  a  document  which  the  respondent
    considers to be a fraud and to establish it would require disclosure by
    the respondent to the appellant of the mechanism or  intelligence  that
    led to that conclusion.  This is not a case involving disclosure  of  a
    "matter relating to the detection of forgery".   Further, it is  not  a
    case about disclosure of the  confidential  source  by  the  party  not
    relying on the document.  It is about disclosure by the party who  does
    rely upon the document, namely  disclosure  by  the  appellant  to  the
    respondent.  Section 108(1) had no application to this case.

22. Turning to the remaining points, there is no doubt,  as  Ms  Fitzsimons
    submitted on behalf of the appellant, that Judge Powell was well  aware
    of the approach to be taken following Devaseelan [2003] Imm AR 1  given
    Judge MacDonald's adverse finding.  He took Judge  MacDonald's  finding
    as the starting  point.   Judge  Powell  had  additional  material,  in
    particular Mr Schroder's reports and the document now  relied  upon  by
    the appellant to show she was of interest to the Ethiopian authorities.
     The judge was clearly well aware that he  had  found  aspects  of  the
    appellant's account not to be credible.  Whilst he did not  accept  how
    the appellant had come into possession of the document, there was ample
    evidence before him to find  that  the  document  was  a  reliable  one
    showing the interest of the Ethiopian authorities in the appellant.  If
    she was, it is not suggested that the judge was wrong to find that  she
    was at risk of persecution on return.  I am wholly unpersuaded that his
    findings were irrational or otherwise not properly open to him  on  the
    evidence.

23.  For  these  reasons,  I  reject  the  Secretary  of  State's   grounds
    challenging the judge's decision.

Decision

24. For the above reasons, the First-tier Tribunal's decision to allow  the
    appellant's appeal on asylum grounds and under Art 3 of  the  ECHR  did
    not involve the making of an error of law.  That decision stands.

25. Accordingly, the Secretary of State's appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  is
    dismissed.
