                        (NO ANONYMITY DIRECTION MADE)
                                                                  Respondent

Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Mills  (Home Office Presenting Officer)
For the Respondent:    Mr Chimpango (Legal Representative)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. The respondent in these proceedings was  the  appellant  before  the
       First-tier Tribunal. From hereon I have referred to the  parties  as
       they were in the First-tier Tribunal so that for  example  reference
       to the respondent is a reference to the Secretary of State  for  the
       Home Department.

    2. The Appellant is a citizen of Malawi. He entered the United  Kingdom
       on June 20, 2004 as a visitor and was subsequently granted leave  to
       remain as a spouse and then as a Tier 4  partner  until  January  7,
       2013. He then applied for leave to remain as a spouse on January  3,
       2013 but this was refused with appeal rights exhausted  on  December
       13, 2013. However, on December 13, 2013 he made a fresh  application
       for leave to remain as a spouse and this was granted until  February
       8, 017. On March 9, 2015 he applied for indefinite leave on basis of
       long residency. The respondent refused this application on  May  15,
       2015  on  the  basis  he  had  not  produced  the  Life  in  the  UK
       certificate.

    3. The appellant appealed that decision  under  section  82(1)  of  the
       Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 on May 29, 2015.

    4. The appeal came before Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Bircher
       (hereinafter referred to as the Judge) on August 13, 2015 and  in  a
       decision promulgated on September 29, 2016  the  Judge  allowed  the
       appellant's appeal.

    5.  The  respondent  lodged  grounds  of  appeal  on  October  5,  2015
       submitting the Judge had  erred  in  allowing  the  appeal  outright
       because paragraph 276C made it clear that the  discretion  lay  with
       the respondent and as the Judge found the Rules were met the  appeal
       should only have been allowed to  the  extent  that  the  respondent
       should have been invited to make a lawful decision.

    6. Permission to appeal was granted by Designated Judge of  the  First-
       tier Tribunal Shaerf on March 2, 2016 on the  basis  the  respondent
       had not had an opportunity to consider the Judge's decision and  the
       decision should  have  been  remitted  back  to  her  for  a  lawful
       decision.

    7. The matter came before me on the above date and I heard  submissions
       from both representatives.

    8. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction.  I  saw
       no reason to make one.

SUBMISSIONS

    9. Mr Mills relied on the grounds of appeal and referred me to GK (Long
       residence-immigration  history)  Lebanon  [2008]  UKAIT  00011.   He
       referred to paragraphs [23] and [24] of that decision and  submitted
       paragraph 276C of the Rules made clear  that  "Indefinite  leave  to
       remain on the ground of long residence in the United Kingdom may  be
       granted provided that the Secretary of State is satisfied that  each
       of the requirements of  paragraph  276B  is  met."  Accordingly,  he
       submitted that  since  the  respondent  had  yet  to  exercise  that
       discretion the appeal could only be allowed under s.86(3)(a) of  the
       2002 Act insofar as the decision was not in accordance with the law.

   10. Mr Chimpango submitted what he described as a Rule 24  response.  As
       it was only served yesterday it could not properly  described  as  a
       Rule 24 response but I allowed it to be introduced  as  submissions.
       He submitted the Judge had  not  said  he  had  allowed  the  appeal
       outright and the ground of appeal bordered on semantics.

   11. Having  heard  the  representatives'  submissions,  I  indicated  my
       findings as set out below.

DISCUSSION AND FINDINGS

   12. The Judge's core finding that the appellant  had  been  living  here
       continuously for ten years was unchallenged. The Judge concluded the
       Rules were met. This too remained unchallenged.

   13. The only issue  was  whether  the  Judge  should  have  allowed  the
       decision outright or remitted it back to the respondent to  consider
       that aspect of the Rule as Rule 276C indicates that  the  discretion
       lies with the respondent.

   14. Mr Chimpango did not disagree with the  respondent's  argument  that
       the discretion to allow indefinite leave lies with  the  respondent.
       His submission was that the Judge  did  not  necessarily  allow  the
       appeal outright but to use wording from his own legal argument  that
       is I believe "semantics".

   15. The Judge stated at both paragraphs [14] and [16]  that  he  allowed
       the appeal. If the Judge had intended to restrict his grant  of  the
       appeal, then it was incumbent on him to say as much.

   16. There is therefore an error in law.

   17. I do not need to revisit any of the facts of this case and all  that
       remains is required is a fresh and legal decision.

DECISION

   18. The making of the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve
       the making of an error on a point of law.

   19. I set aside that decision to the extent that the appellant's  appeal
       is allowed to the extent that it is remitted back to the respondent,
       under section 86(3)(a) of the 2002 Act, to exercise  her  discretion
       under paragraph 276C HC 395.
