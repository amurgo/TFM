Anonymity

Rule 14: The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
An anonymity direction was made by the First-tier Tribunal. As a protection
claim, it is appropriate to continue that direction.

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal  with  permission  against  a
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Hendry) promulgated on  20th
    May 2016 in which it  dismissed  the  Appellant's  appeal  against  the
    Respondent's refusal to grant him asylum/humanitarian protection.

 2. The Appellant, whose date of birth  is  [  ]  1999,  is  a  citizen  of
    Albania.

Background

 3. The Appellant arrived in the UK on 24th November 2014 (aged  15  years)
    and claimed asylum the following day.  His claim revolves  around  ill-
    treatment and abuse received at the hands  of  his  father,  who  drank
    excessively, took drugs and was violent towards not only the Appellant,
    but his mother and younger siblings.

 4. The Appellant feared to return  to  Albania  because  although  he  had
    escaped, with the help of an aunt, there was no-one in Albania to offer
    him effective protection should he return; the authorities  in  Albania
    were incapable of  offering  protection,  although  the  Appellant  had
    attended school and had obtained some casual work in the past.

 5. The Respondent in her refusal letter dated  18th  June  2015  concluded
    that the Appellant did not meet the criteria for  a  grant  of  asylum.
    The core of his claim was disbelieved.  However on account of his being
    an unaccompanied minor, he was granted a period of discretionary  leave
    to expire on 14th December 2016.

 6. In granting that leave the Respondent specifically  considered  Section
    55 Borders, Citizenship and  Immigration  Act  2009  and  came  to  the
    following conclusion. Whilst it would be in the best interests  of  the
    Appellant to return to Albania, she  acknowledged  that  there  was  in
    force a policy that no unaccompanied minor would be returned to Albania
    unless safe and adequate reception arrangements  were  in  place.   The
    Respondent decided therefore to grant a period of  discretionary  leave
    set to expire when the Appellant reached 17ï¿½ years  of  age,  with  the
    added assurance that he would not  be  returned  to  Albania  until  he
    reached 18 years of age.

FtT Decision

 7. In a lengthy detailed decision, the FtT set  out  the  history  of  the
    claim,  the  Appellant's  evidence  and  the  issues  raised   by   the
    Respondent's refusal letter.  The FtT then set out its findings of fact
    in [52] onwards.  The judge found the Appellant's account of  his  past
    history to be, in the main, credible and looked to any future risk.

 8. I pause here to outline what the judge said concerning the  Appellant's
    past history.  At [58] she said the following:

         "In summary, I accepted that he had been subjected to physical  and
         emotional abuse by his father, and had not been  protected  by  his
         mother.  His aunt had been his  only  significant  protector,  but,
         partly because she was his father's sister,  and  because  she  was
         part of the same patriarchal society, she did not consider that she
         could continue to protect him after the most serious attack in  May
         2014, and this was the reason she had  made  arrangements  for  the
         Appellant to leave Albania, and, ultimately to come to  the  United
         Kingdom."

 9. The judge then went  on  to  consider  the  current  situation  of  the
    Appellant, who by the time of the hearing before her was  16  years  of
    age, just shy of 17.

10. She directed herself on the Ravichandran principle and  said  that  she
    was obliged to decide the  issue  of  whether  the  Appellant  met  the
    criteria for being granted asylum at the date of the hearing.

11. The judge then acknowledged that the Appellant's own argument  is  that
    he would be again subjected to torture and beating  if  returned.   She
    found however that at the time of the assault upon him  which  was  the
    driving factor for his flight, he was only 14 years old  and  therefore
    physically and mentally vulnerable to pressure and physical violence by
    his father.  The judge continued by saying "he [the appellant] was  now
    more than two years older, and would be far better equipped  to  resist
    his father's behaviour.  It seemed unlikely that  his  aunt  would  not
    continue to offer him support".

12. Following on from that  finding  the  judge  at  [66]  noted  what  the
    Appellant said about not being safe with his aunt  because  his  father
    would learn where he was. However she had to consider  him  as  at  the
    date of the hearing and by the hearing he was nearly 17 and  likely  to
    be far less vulnerable.  He was not without family  to  whom  he  could
    return.  She noted further that when his aunt arranged for him to leave
    Albania this may well have been the only way in which safety  could  be
    ensured but that the situation now was different and it  seemed  likely
    that he would no longer be vulnerable to being "dragged back  home"  by
    his father.

13. Having noted that it was accepted that there are  inadequate  reception
    facilities for minors in Albania, the judge said that  it  was  not  so
    crucial in a situation where the Appellant could  be  returned  to  the
    care of a family member, and that the SSHD had in  any  event,  granted
    the Appellant leave to remain until December  2016  and  had  indicated
    that he would not be removed until he reached the age  of  18  in  June
    2017 [67].  She then went on to dismiss his appeal.

Grounds of Application

14. The grounds contend that the FtT erred by;

      i) failing to give adequate reasons why the Appellant would no  longer
         be at risk from his father; it was inconsistent/irrational to  find
         that the Appellant had been at risk  of  great  violence  from  his
         father, but was now two years older and therefore "better equipped"
         to deal with this behaviour;

     ii) misdirecting itself on the Ravichandran principle  by  taking  into
         account that under the discretionary leave granted to the Appellant
         he would not be returned to Albania until he was 18 years of age;

    iii) inconsistency in the assertion that the Appellant's aunt  (who  had
         arranged for his flight to the UK) could provide protection on  his
         return.

15. Permission was granted by FtT Ford in the following terms:

         "1.  The Appellant seeks permission to appeal, in time,  against  a
             decision of First-tier Tribunal (Judge Hendry) promulgated  on
             20 May 2016  whereby  it  dismissed  the  Appellant's  upgrade
             appeal.

         2.   Although it  is  not  entirely  clear,  it  does  appear  from
             paragraph 67 that  Judge  Hendry  assessed  the  risk  to  the
             Appellant as at the date the Respondent  indicated  she  would
             remove him (i.e. as at the age of eighteen) rather than as  at
             the date of hearing.

         3.   There is an arguable material error of law."

16. The Respondent opposed the appeal.   The  Rule  24  response  seemingly
    acknowledged  that  the  judge  had  considered  the   eventuality   of
    hypothetical return at [66] and [67] but that could not be said to be a
    material error.  The judge had made clear findings that  the  Appellant
    who was just shy of 17 years would be less vulnerable to  his  father's
    behaviour.

The UT Hearing

17. I heard full submissions from both representatives.  On the basis  that
    I had reached no decision on whether the FtT had erred in law,  I  also
    canvassed with both representatives their  views  on  disposal  of  the
    matter should I find an error of law requiring the decision to  be  set
    aside.

18. Ms Foot's submissions kept to the  lines  of  the  grounds  of  seeking
    permission together with a skeleton argument served  on  the  Tribunal.
    She highlighted the following points:

       . There was simply no sound basis for the finding that the  Appellant
         could on account of his increased age, be  said  to  be  no  longer
         vulnerable to attacks by his father.  If returned he would still be
         under the control of his father.  He would still be a minor.

       . His aunt would not be in a position to offer  protection.   It  was
         irrational of the judge to find that his aunt would do so, when the
         only way that his aunt had been  able  to  help  him  was  to  make
         arrangements for his flight.

       . The SSHD's own policy is  that  there  are  no  adequate  reception
         facilities  for  unaccompanied  minors  in  Albania  and  displaced
         children in Albania are at risk  of  trafficking,  destitution  and
         other exploitation which could amount to an Article 3 ECHR risk.

19. Mr Tarlow defended the decision.  He did acknowledge without  conceding
    any point, that the  FtT  had  gone  on  to  look  at  the  Appellant's
    circumstances at the age of 18 years, but, he argued  that  such  error
    was not material as the decision contained sufficient reference to  the
    Appellant's circumstances at the date of  hearing.   He  outlined  that
    those references included the Appellant's aunt being  able  to  provide
    protection, and the fact that the Appellant was nearly 17 years of  age
    by the time of the hearing.

20. Ms Foot responded saying that the  finding  that  the  Appellant  could
    safely return was contradictory, when looked at in  the  light  of  the
    Respondent's own grant of  discretionary  leave.   Those  contradictory
    findings  together  with  the   irrational   finding   concerning   the
    Appellant's aunt, tainted the judge's fact  finding  and  rendered  the
    decision flawed.  It should be set aside.

Consideration

21. I find I am satisfied that the FtT's decision contains error  requiring
    it to be set aside and remade.  I now give my reasons for this finding.
     First the FtT appears at [67] to have taken an incorrect  approach  in
    placing reliance upon the fact that  the  Appellant  had  been  granted
    discretionary leave and would not  therefore  be  returned  to  Albania
    until 18 years of age.  I find that the judge should have confined  her
    assessment of risk to evaluating matters as they stood at the  date  of
    the hearing and it is not at all clear that this is what she has  done.
    This appears to have tainted her reasoning  on  whether  the  Appellant
    could be assessed as being vulnerable and at risk on return.

22. Secondly, following on from that, the judge appears to have  made  what
    seems on the face of it to be inconsistent findings.   She  found  that
    the Appellant had been subject to physical abuse from  his  father  and
    that his aunt had been unable to protect him.  She decided  however  as
    he was now nearly 17 years of age he would be far less  vulnerable  and
    better equipped and able to look to his aunt  for  protection  in  that
    should his father come looking for him, he would be able to  deal  with
    him because of his increased age.  The judge appears to have  given  no
    consideration to the possibility  that  on  return,  as  a  minor,  the
    Appellant's  father  may  still  have  legal  responsibility  for  him.
    Therefore it is unclear that his aunt would  be  able  to  prevent  his
    father from bringing him back home, should she even wish to do so.

23. In these circumstances I am satisfied that  the  judge's  reasoning  is
    flawed and that the decision must be set aside for error.

24. Ms Foot was of the view that if I found an error the matter  should  be
    returned to the First-tier Tribunal for that  Tribunal  to  remake  the
    decision.  Mr Tarlow did not dissent  from  that  view  other  than  to
    reiterate that the decision should stand.

25. Ms Foot asked that the findings of Judge Hendry at [52] to [58]  should
    be preserved; but I decline to follow that course.  I am  of  the  view
    that because of the flaws identified and  the  fact  that  part  of  Ms
    Foot's submissions centred on the decision being unsafe because of  the
    tainted findings made, the decision should be set aside in its entirety
    and a full fresh hearing should take place with new  findings  of  fact
    being made.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal dated 2nd May 2016 is set aside  for
material error.  I remit the matter to Taylor House (not Judge  Hendry)  for
a fresh rehearing to take place.  The Appellant will need to attend  and  be
called as a witness.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

An anonymity direction is made as the Appellant is a minor.

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify them or any member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
