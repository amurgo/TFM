Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms Foot, counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr Nath, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Given my references to the personal circumstances of the appellants and
    their minority  at  the  date  of  application,  I  make  an  anonymity
    direction.

 2. This matter has a lengthy history.  The  appellants  are  brothers  and
    Eritrean citizens. They applied  in  2013  for  entry  clearance  under
    paragraph 319X of the Immigration Rules and on  human  rights  grounds.
    The applications were refused. Following those  decisions,  the  second
    appellant disappeared; his whereabouts are not  known.  Notwithstanding
    this event (which is said to be involuntary), notices  of  appeal  were
    issued in the names of both appellants. Their  appeals  were  dismissed
    under the Immigration Rules by FTTJ Pacey  but  allowed  on  Article  8
    grounds. The respondent appealed to the Upper Tribunal and DUTJ  Davey,
    having found a material error of law in the FTTJ's  assessment  of  the
    public interest, remitted the matter to the First-tier Tribunal  for  a
    fresh hearing. He did so in terms that the findings of  FTTJ  Pacey  as
    regards the Immigration Rules were to stand, as  did  certain  of  FTTJ
    Pacey's findings of fact.

 3. The matter was  heard  afresh  by  FTTJ  Grimmett  whose  decision  was
    promulgated on  22  June  2015.   Her  findings  were  limited  to  the
    appellant's human rights claims and included the preserved findings  of
    FTTJ Pacey.  FTTJ Grimmett dismissed the appeals on Article 8 grounds.

 4. The appellants applied for permission to appeal and this was granted by
    Designated Judge Shaerf on 21 September 2015 who noted:

         "The disappearance, said to be involuntary, of the Second Appellant
         needed to have been considered, if only for the light it might have
         thrown on the situation of  the  Appellants  at  the  date  of  the
         Respondent's decisions.  The Upper Tribunal had expressly  referred
         to it as a matter to be considered in its  decision  remitting  the
         appeals to the First-tier Tribunal.

         The Judge's treatment of the claim under Article 8 of the  European
         Convention outside the Immigration Rules did not take into  account
         that  the  factors  referred  to  in  sections  117A-117D  of   the
         Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 as amended are matters
         which need to be reflected in the assessment of the proportionality
         of the decision, taking into account the principles  enunciated  in
         Mundeba [2013] UKUT 00088.

         The grounds disclose arguable errors of law and  having  regard  to
         the history of these appeals, all may be advanced."

 5. Thus the matter came before me.

 6. Ms Foot, for  the  appellants,  relied  on  her  skeleton  argument  in
    asserting the decision contained errors of law. In summary, it  is  the
    appellants' case that FTTJ Grimmett materially misdirected herself with
    regard  to  the  application  of  ss85  and  85A  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (the 2002 Act); she should  have  taken
    into account the disappearance of the second appellant because this was
    post-decision evidence which illuminated the circumstances appertaining
    at the date of decision. Furthermore, her failure to do so was contrary
    to the direction of the Upper  Tribunal.  In  addition,  the  FTTJ  had
    misdirected herself with regard to  the  weight  to  be  given  to  the
    maintenance of effective immigration  control  in  the  proportionality
    assessment. Nor had the FTTJ considered the  protected  rights  of  the
    sponsor or the compelling circumstances of the  appellants.  There  had
    been no identification of the  best  interests  of  the  appellants  or
    recognition that this was a refugee family reunion case.  Nor  had  the
    FTTJ considered the relevance of the preserved findings of  FTTJ  Pacey
    (albeit they had been  cited).  She  submitted  that,  being  an  entry
    clearance case, more subtle consideration of  s117  was  required  than
    that undertaken by the FTTJ. She submitted that there was an obligation
    on the respondent to facilitate the reunion of  refugees,  particularly
    children.

 7. Mr Nath, for the respondent, conceded that it had been appropriate  for
    the FTTJ to consider the appeals  in  accordance  with  the  Article  8
    jurisprudence, outside the Immigration Rules.   However,  he  submitted
    that that assessment  of  proportionality  had  been  appropriate.   He
    further submitted that the findings of the  FTTJ  with  regard  to  the
    application of s85A were sustainable. He relied on SSHD v SS (Congo)  &
    Ors [2015] EWCA Civ 387, para  39(iii)  and  (iv).  He  also  cited  AM
    (S117B) Malawi [2015] UKUT 0260 (IAC) and  Dube  (ss.117A-117D)  [2015]
    UKUT 90 (IAC).  Whilst the FTTJ had not referred to s55, she had  taken
    into account the appellants' compelling situation and  therefore  their
    best interests. She had considered those against s117B.

 8. Contrary to the grounds of appeal, DUTJ Davey had made  it  clear  that
    the only issue before him was Article 8; there was  therefore  no  need
    for FTTJ Grimmett to make a decision under the Immigration Rules.

 9.  Given  that  DUTJ  Davey  had  expressly  referred  in  his   decision
    promulgated on 24 March 2015 to FTTJ Pacey's inadequate  findings  with
    regard to the disappearance of the second appellant and that this would
    "need to be reconsidered and analysed with reasons", it  is  surprising
    that FTTJ Grimmett has not addressed this matter in her decision.  FTTJ
    Grimmett notes the submission of Mr Lane for the  appellants  that  she
    could take into account matters arising after  the  date  of  decision,
    including the disappearance of the second appellant, pursuant to s85(4)
    of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 but find (paragraph
    7):

         "... with regard to out of country appeals that is only permissible
         where the matter arising after the date of decision relates back to
         the position at the date of decision.  Section  85A  which  was  in
         force at the time of the decision provides that:-

             "85A: Matters to be considered: new evidence: exceptions

               1) This section sets out the exceptions mentioned in  Section
                  85(5).

               2) Exception 1 is that in relation to an appeal under Section
                  82(1) against an immigration decision of a kind  specified
                  in Section 82(2)(b) or (c) the Tribunal may consider  only
                  the circumstances appertaining at the date of decision."

10. FTTJ Grimmett goes on to state: "In my view the disappearance  of  [the
    second appellant] in the early part of 2014 is not a matter  which  was
    foreseeable at the date of decision  and  is  not  a  matter  that  can
    therefore relate back to the date of decision".  No reason is given for
    this conclusion and it ignores the evidence  of  the  appellants  that,
    shortly before  the  applications  were  made,  the  appellants'  elder
    brother had disappeared, eventually making contact with the sponsor  by
    telephone to tell her that he had been taken, with other children, into
    forced labour in Libya. Given this evidence, which was available to the
    FTTJ and unchallenged by the respondent, the  FTTJ's  conclusions  that
    the similar disappearance by the second appellant was not "foreseeable"
    required reasoning and explanation, particularly  as  the  sponsor  had
    specifically identified such a risk prior  to  the  applications  being
    made.  In the light of this  evidence,  the  FTTJ's  finding  that  the
    disappearance  was  not  foreseeable  is  inadequately   reasoned   and
    unsustainable.   The  appellants  were  living,  at   that   time,   in
    impoverished circumstances and the risk of being trafficked was a  live
    issue of relevance to an assessment of their circumstances at the  date
    of decision. Further, it was a material fact which might have  impacted
    on the outcome of the appeals.

11. Whilst the FTTJ  took  into  account  (her  paragraph  9)  the  current
    circumstances of the children, at no stage did she identify their  best
    interests. As was decided in Zoumbas v SSHD [2013] UKSC  74,  the  best
    interests of a child  are  an  integral  part  of  the  proportionality
    assessment under Article 8 ECHR and must  be  a  primary  consideration
    albeit they can  be  outweighed  by  the  cumulative  effect  of  other
    considerations.  The FTTJ's failure to identify the best  interests  of
    the appellants infects her proportionality assessment: it  should  have
    been an integral part of it.  This failure is a material error of law.

12. Ms Foot and Mr Nath agreed that, given my findings of  errors  of  law,
    the decision should be remade on human rights grounds, there  being  no
    challenge to the dismissal of the appeals under the Immigration  Rules.
    Both agreed that the findings of fact of FTTJ Grimmett and the  earlier
    findings of FTTJ Pacey (as set out  in  FTTJ  Grimmett's  paragraph  6)
    should be preserved.

13. On the  substantive  Article  8  issue,  Ms  Foot  submitted  that  the
    sponsor's efforts to get her brothers to the UK were an  indication  of
    the nature of the family's relationship: the appellants were  dependent
    on the sponsor who was in loco parentis. She submitted that the  issues
    raised in the reasons  for  refusal  letter  had  now  been  addressed.
    Findings could be made  on  the  reasons  for  the  second  appellant's
    disappearance. The expert evidence and that of the sponsor was that the
    best interests of the children required them to be reunited in the  UK.
    Given the appellants' highly precarious circumstances at  the  date  of
    decision, their best  interests  required  them  to  be  granted  entry
    clearance.  Entry clearance  was  the  only  reasonable  hope  for  the
    sponsor and appellants  to  enjoy  family  life;  their  relatives  had
    disappeared. They were a refugee family who should be reunited. Ms Foot
    was uncertain  whether  the  "historic  family  reunion  policy"  still
    applied as this was now addressed in the Rules but, in  any  event,  it
    had been established that if the Rules were not  met,  entry  clearance
    could be granted if compelling and compassionate circumstances existed.
    That was the case here. This gave reduced weight to the  s117  factors,
    she  submitted.   She  said  there  was  an  obligation  on  states  to
    facilitate the reunion of families torn apart by  persecution;  it  was
    always going to be unlikely for refugee children outside the UK to have
    English language skills or financial independence. The factors in s117B
    were not capable of outweighing these children's best interests.

14. I have also borne in mind Ms  Foot's  skeleton  argument  and  the  two
    skeleton arguments of Mr Lane who represented  the  appellants  in  the
    First-tier Tribunal on two occasions.

15. Mr Nath, for the respondent, noted that the sponsor was not employed at
    the  date  of  decision.  There  was  no  evidence  of  her   financial
    circumstances or accommodation. He did not contest  that  accommodation
    would be provided for them in the UK. However, there was no evidence of
    the level of dependence of the appellants on the sponsor;  this  was  a
    relevant issue in the assessment of proportionality.  The brothers  had
    lived in Sudan for about five years at the date  of  decision.  At  the
    date of application they were aged 16  and  14  and,  at  the  date  of
    decision, aged 17 and 15.  Their best interests were not a trump  card.
    The appellants had sponsor had been separated  since  2008.  There  was
    little evidence of contact or dependency.

16. Mr Nath accepted that, the appellants having failed to demonstrate that
    they fulfil the criteria in the Immigration Rules, their appeal  should
    be considered in the light of the Article 8 jurisprudence. I proceed on
    that  basis,  given  the  guidance  in  SS  (Congo):  the   appellants'
    circumstances are compelling: they are minors without parental  support
    and they are living in impoverished circumstances.

17. The burden of proof insofar as the Article 8 claims are concerned,  the
    burden of proof is on the appellants  to  show  that  the  respondent's
    decisions interfere with their right to respect for their  private  and
    family lives. If the appellants are able to establish that, it  is  for
    the respondent to justify the decisions under Article  8(2).  The  sole
    issue in this case is whether the decisions of  the  respondent  breach
    Article 8.

18. I bear in mind the guidance in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27.  I also  bear  in
    mind the findings of JFTT Grimmett which includes those of JFTT  Pacey.
    The respondent has acknowledged  through  her  representatives  at  the
    hearing before FTTJ Grimmett and before me,  that  the  appellants  and
    sponsor have a family life.  Nonetheless  I  set  out  the  nature  and
    extent of that family life because it is not straightforward.

19. The sponsor is  the  appellants'  eldest  sibling,  their  sister.  The
    appellants and sponsor had co-habited in Eritrea prior to the  latter's
    flight to the UK in 2008; this was organised by the  sponsor's  mother.
    At that time, the siblings were all minors.  The  sponsor  was  granted
    asylum in the UK. At the time of their applications,  the  sponsor  had
    limited leave to  remain  in  the  UK  as  a  refugee.  The  appellants
    continued to live with their mother in Eritrea until  2009  when  their
    mother was arrested (their father having previously been  arrested  and
    disappeared).   The  appellants'  and  sponsor's   mother   has   since
    disappeared and there has been no contact with her. In January 2009 the
    appellants fled to Sudan to live  with  their  elder  brother  who  had
    previously fled there  having  escaped  from  the  Eritrean  army.  The
    sponsor regained contact with the appellants and their elder brother in
    2010. From that time, she has made attempts to obtain  entry  clearance
    for her three brothers (including the two appellants) to settle in  the
    UK. Her efforts were initially hampered by her  inability  to  pay  the
    respondent's fees. Before applications  were  eventually  submitted  in
    2013  the  appellants'  elder  brother  disappeared.  It  later  became
    apparent (when he contacted the sponsor by  telephone  in  April  2015)
    that he had been taken by traffickers to work on a fruit farm in Libya,
    where he is being held against his will.  As a result, the applications
    for entry clearance which have given rise to these appeals,  were  made
    only by the two appellants, with the support of the sponsor.

20. I bear in mind the guidance in Mundeba (s.55 and para 297(i)(f)) [2013]
    UKUT 88 (IAC) which identifies the issues to be  addressed  arising  in
    connection with an application under paragraph 297. These appeals arise
    in connection with paragraph 319X which contains the  requirements  for
    leave to enter the UK as the child of a relative with limited leave  to
    enter or remain in the UK as a refugee. Nonetheless Mundeba's  guidance
    is instructive and I make the following findings  with  regard  to  the
    best interests of the appellants.

21. The appellants are de facto orphans. They were aged 15 and  17  at  the
    date of decision. They have lived in Sudan since January  2009,  having
    arrived there at the ages of 12 and 14.  Until shortly before they made
    their applications for entry clearance, the appellants were living with
    their elder brother; he was then trafficked to Libya where  he  is  now
    known to be in forced labour on a fruit farm. The elder brother  is  in
    contact with  his  sister  in  the  UK,  the  appellants'  sponsor,  by
    telephone occasionally.  The second  appellant  disappeared  after  the
    date of decision and is believed to have been trafficked also but there
    has been no contact with him. Both the second appellant and  his  elder
    brother were adults when they disappeared.

22. There is no suggestion of any delay by the  respondent  in  making  her
    decisions.

23. At the date of decision, the appellants  were  living  in  unacceptably
    basic conditions in Sudan. They were reliant on the  charity  of  their
    community and mosque. They  slept  outside  in  a  yard  in  inadequate
    bedding, only being permitted to sleep indoors when it was raining  and
    only then, for cultural reasons, when the brother of the  occupier  was
    present. When sleeping indoors, they slept on the floor, not in a  bed.
    This arrangement was insecure because the occupier envisaged  returning
    to her family in Eritrea and would then give  up  the  tenancy  of  the
    property.  The appellants would be unable to pay the rent and there was
    no guarantee the landlord would accept them as tenants.

24. The appellants lived a hand to mouth existence with very  basic  access
    to food and  to  sanitation.  They  had  no  access  to  education  and
    considerable problems arose when one became ill because there  were  no
    funds to obtain proper medical care.  Were it not for the assistance of
    the occupier of the property, the appellants would be destitute.

25. The sponsor describes her brothers as "good at studying" which suggests
    that they have been educated in the past. There  is  no  evidence  they
    have access to education in Sudan.

26. Until 2013 and their elder brother's disappearance, the appellants were
    under his supervision and care. Since his disappearance, shortly before
    their applications were made in  2013,  they  have  had  limited  adult
    support from the person on whose premises they live. This is said to be
    a short-term arrangement but has continued  for  some  time  with  very
    limited financial support from the sponsor.  There is  no  evidence  to
    suggest that the sponsor's  limited  and  sporadic   financial  support
    cannot continue. The assistance of the person  who  provides  food  and
    limited accommodation to date is therefore precarious but ongoing.

27. The sponsor was not employed at the date of decision but was living  on
    Jobseekers Allowance (JSA) of �65 a week. At the date of decision  "the
    Sponsor ... has worked hard to learn English and to put  herself  in  a
    position where she is able to support herself and it does  look  as  if
    that will happen in the very near future." (paragraph 10).  However, at
    that time she was not working. Thus she had not worked from  2008  when
    she arrived in the UK until the date  of  decision  (January  2014),  a
    period of six years.  In her asylum interview the sponsor refers to  an
    elder step-brother, Omar, whom she met in France and who, at  the  time
    of her interview, was also seeking asylum.  She described him as  being
    with her at the time of interview. She described  him  as  "my  brother
    from my mother".  According to  the  appellants'  solicitors  in  their
    letter of 27 August 2013 accompanying the applications,  Omar  (who  is
    erroneously described as the sponsor's cousin) was not working at  that
    time. He has been unable to support the appellants either.

28. I recognise  that  settlement  in  the  UK  would  remove  these  child
    appellants from their precarious and vulnerable situation and  that  to
    live with their  elder  sister  in  the  UK  would  be  in  their  best
    interests,  addressing  their  day-to-day  welfare  needs:  they  would
    benefit from her support and could live in  her  accommodation.  Whilst
    she has a very  limited  income  of  �65,  this  is  greater  than  the
    appellants have  at  the  moment.   That  said,  there  would  be  some
    difficulties associated with living in  the  UK,  a  country  which  is
    significantly  different  to  Eritrea  and  Sudan.   There   would   be
    difficulties integrating into British society, even with the support of
    their sister who is now familiar with life in the UK. They  are  of  an
    age when they would not necessarily find it  straightforward  to  learn
    English.  It is in their interests to remain  in  a  society  which  is
    familiar to them and where they can engage with friends  of  their  own
    culture and background.  This is particularly the case given that  they
    have already moved from their country of origin to  a  new  environment
    and have now become used to life in Sudan, albeit  in  very  precarious
    and difficult circumstances. They are living as  impecunious  migrants,
    on the charity of others.  They  have  minor  health  issues  (constant
    colds) and limited access to healthcare for which they must pay.

29. Given my findings as regards the appellants' circumstances, I find that
    it is in their best interests to come to the  UK  to  live  with  their
    sister and to benefit from  all  that  life  in  the  UK  would  offer:
    adequate accommodation, maintenance, free healthcare and  opportunities
    to study, work and better themselves.

30.  In  addressing  the  proportionality  of  the  interference  with  the
    appellants' and their sister's protected rights, I must  also  bear  in
    mind the provisions of s117A-C  of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum  Act  2002.  In  particular,  the   maintenance   of   effective
    immigration control is in the public interest: the  appellants  do  not
    fulfil the criteria in  the  Immigration  Rules  for  entry  clearance,
    specifically paragraph 319X.

31. The  Immigration  Rules  manifest  the  public  interest  in  effective
    immigration control. The appellants do not fulfil the criteria  in  the
    Rules insofar as family reunion is concerned notwithstanding  paragraph
    319X is drafted to reflect  the  state's  obligations  insofar  as  the
    reunion of  refugee  families  is  concerned.    It  is  relevant  that
    paragraph 319X requires not only that there are "serious and compelling
    family or other  considerations  which  make  exclusion  of  the  child
    undesirable" but also seeks to address the public interest  factors  in
    s117B by requiring the applicant to demonstrate they would be  able  to
    live here without recourse to public funds.

32. I am satisfied that there  are  serious  and  compelling  circumstances
    which make the exclusion of the appellants undesirable because they are
    de facto orphans, have no older relatives in Sudan to care for them and
    are living in poverty with limited health care.  Thus they  fulfil  the
    criteria in paragraph 319X(ii).   However,  whilst  there  is  adequate
    space  for  the  appellants  in  the  sponsor's   accommodation,   that
    accommodation is partly funded  by  the  state  in  that  she  receives
    housing benefit and a council tax discount. There would therefore be  a
    small increase  in  the  public  funds  payable  as  a  result  of  the
    appellants' living in the sponsor's accommodation because she would  no
    longer qualify for  the  single  occupancy  discount.   Nor  would  the
    appellants  be  "maintained  adequately",  as  required  by   paragraph
    319X(vii) of the Immigration Rules, without recourse to  public  funds.
    In that regard, I refer to the definition of "adequately" in  Paragraph
    6 of the Immigration Rules:

         "... in relation to a  maintenance  and  accommodation  requirement
         shall mean that, after income tax, national insurance contributions
         and housing costs have been deducted, there must  be  available  to
         the family the level of income that would be available to  them  if
         the family was in receipt of income support."

33. Insofar as the public interests factors in s117B are concerned, neither
    the  appellants  nor  their   sponsor   are   financially   independent
    (unsurprisingly  in  the  case  of  minor  migrants  such  as   these).
    Furthermore, even after six years in the UK, the  sponsor  has  yet  to
    find employment despite attendance on various courses. Also  her  step-
    brother had not found work by  2013.   These  facts  suggest  that  the
    appellants, who do not speak English, would have  similar  difficulties
    finding work and that they would be a burden on the state  for  several
    years after their arrival. I also note the sponsor  intends  that  they
    should study here yet they have no means to pay for such studies.

34. The appellants' lack of  English  language  skills  will  hamper  their
    ability to integrate into British society.  The appellants  have  never
    been to the UK and have no understanding of British society apart  from
    what they have been told by their sister. I bear in  mind  that  whilst
    the sponsor has sent some funds to  the  appellants,  there  is  little
    evidence of dependency between them although I  accept  that  there  is
    some emotional dependency arising from the fact the  sponsor  is  their
    eldest sibling and feels responsible for them.  The relationship of the
    sponsor with the appellants cannot be said to be a de facto  or  quasi-
    parental one given the lack of dependency  and  that  the  sponsor  has
    never had  a  role  in  their  upbringing.   The  sponsor  has  limited
    telephone contact with the appellants.

35. The preserved finding of FTTJ  Pacey  (paragraph  37  of  the  decision
    promulgated on 4 November 2014) is that "the  funds  available  to  the
    family would be below the minimum deemed necessary for a  family  of  3
    here, nonetheless the sponsor has access to proper shelter, to  running
    water and sanitation and to cooking facilities. The standard of  living
    would be considerably better than the Appellants experience at  present
    (and at the date of decision)."  However, even though the conditions in
    this country would be better than in Sudan,  the  appellants  would  be
    living at a standard well below that which is  considered  adequate  by
    Parliament, as demonstrated by the terms of paragraph 319X. The finding
    of FTTJ Pacey that they would not  resort  to  public  funds  has  been
    preserved and I bear that in mind.  Nonetheless, I must give weight  to
    the  fact  that  the  appellants  and  sponsor  are   not   financially
    independent and are unable to fulfil the maintenance and  accommodation
    criteria in paragraph 319X.   I also bear in mind that they  intend  to
    study in the UK and yet have no funding to  do  so.  Furthermore,  they
    would be entitled to free healthcare.  In any event, the mere  fact  of
    not needing to rely on the state for an income is not sufficient  alone
    to outweigh the  requirement  for  effective  immigration  control  (ZY
    (Turkey) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011]  EWCA  Civ
    65).

36. It is also relevant that,  at  the  date  of  decision,  the  sponsor's
    evidence is that she anticipated being able to find a job soon. On this
    evidence, I conclude that she would, on finding  a  job,  increase  the
    financial  contribution  she  makes  to  her   brothers'   upkeep   and
    accommodation with a view to paying their rent and providing them  with
    a more secure environment.  She would also be able to visit them in the
    Sudan. The sponsor speaks to  the  appellants  by  telephone  and  that
    arrangement  can  continue.  Thus  on  the  sponsor's   evidence,   the
    appellants' current living arrangements in Sudan will not be maintained
    in the long term.

37. I am unable to find that the appellants' welfare would  be  jeopardised
    by exclusion from the  United  Kingdom  (T  (s.55  BCIA  2009  -  entry
    clearance) Jamaica [2011] UKUT 00483(IAC).  Whilst it has been  claimed
    that the adult currently assisting the  appellants  will  not  maintain
    this arrangement, the sponsor has sent her money occasionally to enable
    her to do so.  I take into account that  the  risk  of  kidnapping  for
    forced labour existed at the date of decision and I bear  in  mind  the
    background material and expert evidence  on  the  issue.   I  note  the
    appellant's elder brother and the second appellant  were  kidnapped  as
    adults rather than children which suggests there had been, during their
    minority, a degree of protection available for them from the adult  who
    supported them. Nonetheless, I take into account  that  the  appellants
    were vulnerable to harassment and abuse at the date of decision.

38. For the reasons set out above, I find that Article 8 is engaged by  the
    respondent's decisions because there are  grave  consequences  for  the
    appellants as a result: they must continue to live  in  precarious  and
    difficult circumstances without personal  contact  with  their  sister.
    The decisions are lawful in that  the  appellants  do  not  fulfil  the
    criteria in the Immigration Rules.

39. Insofar as the issue  of  proportionality  is  concerned,  I  make  the
    appellants' best interests, as set out above, a  primary  consideration
    and take into account the factual matrix set out  above.   Having  done
    so, I find that the degree of interference with  their  own  and  their
    sponsor's rights to family and private life  is  proportionate  to  the
    respondent's objective of maintaining  effective  immigration  control:
    the public  interest  outweighs  the  degree  of  interference  in  the
    appellants' and their sister's protected rights. I make this finding in
    the light of the facts set out above and because,  notwithstanding  the
    appellants' compelling and compassionate circumstances described above,
    most of the relevant public interest factors listed in s117B apply  and
    the appellants do not fulfil  the  criteria  in  paragraph  319X  which
    reflects the UNHCR guidance on family reunion. Indeed paragraph 319X is
    arguably more favourable to the  appellants  in  that  it  contains  no
    requirement for dependency. The appellants' situation in Sudan warrants
    considerable sympathy but the appellants, who were approaching maturity
    at the date of decision, were being supported and accommodated  (albeit
    inadequately  and  precariously)  by  members  of  their  own  lay  and
    religious communities.  They  were  in  a  similar  situation  to  many
    Eritrean children in Sudan save that they had  reconnected  with  their
    elder sibling in the UK who has been able to provide them with  limited
    financial support.

40. Whilst I note the UNHCR family reunion guidance,  the  appellants  have
    never been and are not now dependent on the sponsor. Even when they did
    regain contact in 2010 the sponsor did not become responsible  for  the
    appellants' upbringing or welfare: they were under the  care  of  their
    elder brother.  Whilst I accept they were not dependent on their  elder
    brother at the date of application and decision, there is  insufficient
    evidence of contact to demonstrate the appellants were emotionally  and
    financially dependent on the sponsor at the date of decision. They were
    dependent on members of their community in practical terms  and  it  is
    likely there has been a degree of emotional support  from  that  source
    also,  given  the   appellants'   ages,   length   of   residence   and
    circumstances.

41. The evidence of the sponsor is that,  at  the  date  of  decision,  she
    expected  to  find  work  shortly  and  thus  the  appellants'  current
    situation is a short-term one: the sponsor's limited qualifications and
    experience indicate that  such  employment  is  unlikely  to  make  her
    financially independent such that she need no longer resort  to  public
    funds but, nonetheless, as her financial situation improves,  she  will
    be able to make a greater and more impactful financial contribution  to
    the appellants' accommodation and maintenance in Sudan.  She  can  also
    continue to maintain contact and provide support by  telephone  as  she
    does at the moment.  In the meantime, the appellants, at  the  date  of
    decision,  had  accommodation  and  maintenance  (albeit   meagre   and
    inadequate).

42. In summary, the decisions to refuse entry clearance do  not  upset  the
    existing dynamic of the siblings' relationship: they have  lived  apart
    during  their  formative  years.  Whilst  they  are  siblings  and  the
    decisions to refuse them entry clearance prevent their  re-establishing
    personal contact as such, in the short term, they do  not  prevent  the
    maintenance of existing telephone contact and,  once  the  sponsor  has
    found employment, personal contact through visits to Sudan.

43. I set aside the decision of FTTJ Grimmett and remake it dismissing  the
    appeals on human rights grounds.

Decision

44. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  did  involve  an
    error on a point of law.

45. I set aside the decision.

46. I re-make the decision in the appeals by dismissing them.

Anonymity Direction

Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
(SI 2008/269) we make an anonymity order. Unless the  Upper  Tribunal  or  a
Court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings  or  any  form  of
publication thereof shall  directly  or  indirectly  identify  the  original
appellants. This direction applies to,  amongst  others,  all  parties.  Any
failure to comply with this direction could give rise to contempt  of  court
proceedings. We do so in  order  to  avoid  a  likelihood  of  serious  harm
arising to the appellant from the contents of his protection claim.


Fee Award

The FTTJ did not make fee  awards  and,  given  my  decision,  that  remains
appropriate.
