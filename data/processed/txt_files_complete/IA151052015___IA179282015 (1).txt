Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr T Melvin, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   No appearance


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The first respondent is a citizen of Nigeria born on 26 March 1973.
    The second respondent is her daughter who was born on [ ] 2008 and is a
    citizen of Poland. The first respondent applied for a residence card as
    confirmation of a right to reside in the UK.  On 31 March 2015 her
    application was refused.

 2. The Secretary of State refused the application for two reasons.  The
    first reason given was that the first respondent did not qualify for a
    residence card based on derivative rights because her daughter was not
    residing in the UK as a self sufficient person in accordance with
    Regulation 4(1)(c) of the Immigration (European Economic Area)
    Regulations 2006 ("the 2006 Regulations") such that Regulation 15A(2)
    of the 2006 Regulations was satisfied.

 3. The second reason given was that the first respondent did not qualify
    for a retained right of residence under Regulation 10(5) because she
    did not supply evidence of having divorced.

 4. The respondents appealed and their appeal was heard by First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Majid.  In a decision promulgated on 11 January 2016
    Judge Majid allowed the appeal. He characterised the circumstances of
    the case as "extraordinary" and discussed some of the principles
    underlying EU and immigration law before concluding that the respondent
    came within the "relevant immigration law" and should be given the
    "benefit of discretion".

 5. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Chohan,
    who stated:

         "I have to say that when one reads the judge's decision it is not
         clear on what basis the appeal was allowed.  No specific findings
         have been made in respect of the EEA Regulations.  There is a clear
         lack of reasoning in the decision."

 6. I heard submissions today from Mr Melvin who reiterated the point made
    by Judge Chohan and identified a number of specific passages in the
    decision that in his view demonstrated a lack of reasoning.  The
    respondents were unrepresented. They did not make any submissions but
    sought to introduce further evidence which I did not allow.

 7. I agree with Judge Chohan's grant of permission. Absent from the First-
    tier Tribunal's decision is any consideration of whether the
    requirements of the 2006 Regulations were satisfied. It is unclear how
    the analysis of immigration law in the decision relates to the matters
    at issue and I am not able to discern from the decision the reasons why
    the appeal was allowed.

 8. I consider this to be a case where the effect of the error of law has
    been to deprive both parties of a fair hearing and therefore one which
    in accordance with Section 7.2 of the Senior President's Practice
    Statement should be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be heard
    afresh.

Notice of Decision

 9. The First-tier Tribunal's decision contained a material error of law.

10. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be heard by a
    judge other than Judge Majid.

11. No anonymity direction is made.
