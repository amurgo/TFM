Representation:
For the Appellants:    Miss K Tobin, Counsel, instructed by Ahmad
Associates PVT Ltd
For the Respondent:    Mr Duffy, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. This is an appeal against a determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
         Judge Greasley, promulgated on 2 January 2015 following  a  hearing
         at First-tier Tribunal Richmond on 11 December 2014, in  which  the
         judge dismissed all five appeals of  this  family  unit  under  the
         Immigration Rules and Article 8  ECHR.  Before  the  Tribunal  this
         morning Miss Tobin has appeared to represent  the  appellants',  Mr
         Duffy has attended on behalf of the Secretary of State.

      2. The judge in the determination examined the evidence that had  been
         provided and although the quality of that  evidence  was  correctly
         identified as being poor by reference to its legibility, the  judge
         went on in paragraph 18 of the determination to make a finding that
         he or she could not be satisfied that the documents  provided  were
         genuine and therefore reliable  documents.   In  paragraph  21  the
         judge repeats such an assertion, stating that he or she was  unable
         to accept that the evidence provided relating to financial  matters
         is reliable and therefore credible.

      3. The ground of challenge to that finding  is  that  this  raised  an
         issue that was not relied upon by the Entry  Clearance  Officer  in
         the notice of decision dated 28 November 2013 and was effectively a
         fresh matter of which the parties had no notice.

      4. Before  the  Tribunal  today  Mr  Duffy  conceded  that  ground  of
         challenge, namely that in going ahead and dealing with a matter  in
         relation to which the parties had  no  notice  and  were  therefore
         denied the opportunity to make submissions or call evidence,  there
         had been a procedural  irregularity  sufficient  to  amount  to  an
         arguable error of law.  We support that concession.  We  set  aside
         the determination of Judge Greasley.

      5. We proceed to remake that  decision.  This  is  an  application  by
         nationals of Pakistan, a mother, two daughters and two  sons  whose
         dates of birth are  set  out  in  paragraph  1  of  the  First-tier
         Tribunal  determination  who  seek  permission  by  way  of   entry
         clearance to join their husband and father who  is  in  the  United
         Kingdom lawfully as a sole representative.

      6. The issue in  relation  to  which  the  applications  were  refused
         related to one point when one considers the documents,  namely  the
         availability  of  capital   funding   to   meet   the   maintenance
         requirement.

      7.  The  starting  point  in  any  case  involving   pre-Appendix   FM
         applications is to consider whether  the  adequacy  of  maintenance
         test is satisfied by reference to the relevant level of income  and
         of the benefits that would be available if the family were  drawing
         income support.  We refer only to income support at this stage  and
         the maintenance issue as  the  availability  of  accommodation  was
         conceded before the First-tier Tribunal by the  Presenting  Officer
         and is not a live issue before us today.

      8. The starting point in any such  assessment  of  a  pre-Appendix  FM
         maintenance assessment is to check that the figures that have  been
         provided and relied upon accurately reflect the appropriate benefit
         level.

      9. In the determination of the First-tier  Tribunal  at  paragraph  15
         there is reference to a figure  of  �6,899.08  being  the  required
         figure.  It has been ascertained this morning that that  figure  in
         fact is wrong and not only marginally but substantially wrong.  The
         income support level for  a  married  couple  with  four  dependent
         children when including the family premium  of  �17.50  equates  to
         �20,403.76 per annum.  The sponsor's evidence throughout has always
         been that he could  satisfy  the  maintenance  requirements  as  he
         receives an income of �20,000 per annum from his employment.   That
         clearly  was  insufficient  to  satisfy  the   �20,403.76   minimum
         requirement making this family unit dependent upon the availability
         of capital.

     10. The ECO was not satisfied that the  capital  disclosed  in  various
         bank accounts was genuinely available.  This Tribunal has  had  the
         benefit of being able to consider witness statements by the sponsor
         and the named individual relating to how the capital  that  was  in
         that bank account became available and how the capital in that bank
         account does represent funds that are  properly  available  to  the
         sponsor, under his control, and for him to spend as he requires.

     11. Although Mr Duffy did not concede the availability  of  capital  he
         quite correctly recognised that he had nothing within  his  armoury
         of submissions that he could put forward to gainsay or counter  the
         submissions that had been made in the witness  statements  relating
         to the availability of those funds. The test for us to consider  is
         whether the appellants have discharged the  burden  of  proof  upon
         them to the required standard that being a civil standard, to  show
         that the required level of funding is available.  It  is  accepted,
         and there is Tribunal authority on this point, that  if  income  is
         insufficient to discharge the maintenance requirement recourse  can
         be made to available capital which will then require an  assessment
         of dividing the shortfall by the capital to see whether the capital
         funds  will  cover  the  requirements  for  a   specified   period,
         previously two years under the old case law, when the need to prove
         reliance or avoidance of reliance on public funds may no longer  be
         an issue.

     12. The  balance  in  the  Pakistan  bank  account  equated  to  �9,427
         according to the figures provided by the  Entry  Clearance  Officer
         which when divided by the shortfall of �403.76 shows capital, which
         is available, sufficient for over 23 years substantially in  excess
         of those realistically going to be required.

     13. For that reason we do find that the appellants have discharged  the
         burden of proof upon them to the required  standard  to  show  that
         they were able to satisfy all the requirements in paragraph 197  of
         the relevant Immigration Rules and  on  that  basis  we  allow  the
         appeals.
