                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     Mr Templeton, of Quinn, Martin & Langan, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This determination is to be read with:

      i) The respondent's decision,  dated  23  August  2017,  refusing  the
         appellant's protection claim.

     ii) The appellant's grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.

    iii) The decision of FtT Judge Lea, promulgated on 26 March 2018.

     iv) The appellant's  grounds  of  appeal  to  the  UT,  stated  in  the
         application for permission to appeal filed with the FtT on 9  April
         2018.

      v) The FtT's refusal of permission, dated 27 April 2018.

     vi) The further grounds of appeal to the UT, stated in the  application
         filed with the UT on 16 May 2018.

    vii) The UT's grant of permission, dated 21 June 2018.

   viii) The respondent's rule 24 response, dated 10 July 2018, to the grant
         of permission.

 2. It was conceded that the FtT's decision errs by failing to explain what
    is made of the evidence of the  witnesses  who  spoke  to  knowing  the
    appellant as an undocumented Bidoon growing up in Kuwait,  and  that  a
    fresh hearing is required, to resolve whether he is in  the  documented
    or undocumented category.  The following outcome was agreed.

 3. The decision of the  FtT  stands  as  a  record  of  the  hearing,  but
    otherwise is set aside.  Under section 12 of the 2007  Act,  and  under
    Practice Statement 7.2, the case is remitted to the  FtT  for  a  fresh
    hearing.  The member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case are  not
    to include Judge Lea.

 4. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
