Representation:
For the Appellant:     Miss A Muzira, Counsel, instructed by Solomon
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant, whose date of birth is  [  ]  1976,  is  a  national  of
    Zimbabwe.  He appeals against a decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge Moore) ("FTT") promulgated  on  15  March  2016  dismissing  his
    appeal on human rights and asylum grounds.

2.   In a Decision and Reasons the FTT found that the central  core  of  the
    appellant's claim  was  lacking  in  credibility.   He  claimed  to  be
    participating in and a persecuted member of the Occupied  Africa  Unity
    Square (OAUS).  His family was  attacked  by  the  CIO  after  he  left
    Zimbabwe and he would be at risk  on  return  due  to  actual/  imputed
    political opinion.

3.   The FTT [23 - 36] found the appellant's claim to be totally lacking  in
    credibility with regard to all issues and made findings as follows:

    (1)  The appellant was not a  member  of  OAUS  and  that  he  was  not
         involved in the petitioning process.

    (2)  It was not accepted that the appellant was assaulted and beaten by
         the police on 25 November 2014.

    (3)  The appellant's reasons for seeking entry clearance to the UK  for
         a graduation ceremony and his reasons for delay in leaving Zimbabwe
         were neither  genuine  nor  reliable  and  further  undermined  his
         credibility.

    (4)  It was not accepted that on three separate  occasions  members  of
         the CIO visited the appellant's home to seek his whereabouts and/or
         that his wife was threatened or tortured.

    (5)  The FTT found the appellant's account to have signed a petition to
         be odd. The FTT reasoned that the appellant's name on the  petition
         appeared in bold upper case lettering in order to highlight that he
         had signed the petition.

    (6)  The FTT made reference to a Google search of the appellant's  name
         which  revealed  a  link  an  (OAUS)  petition  endorsed  with  the
         appellant's full name with a time  reference  of  nine  months  ago
         [27].  The FTT stated

             "I am  uncertain  as  to  what  such  a  Google  search  entry
             precisely denotes, although it does show the appellant's  name
             and the OAUS petition and a specified  time  frame.   However,
             looking at all the evidence in the round I  am  not  satisfied
             that this appellant was engaged in political  activities  with
             OAUS as he has claimed."

    (7)  The FTT found the appellant's explanation for leaving  his  family
         in Zimbabwe where they would  be  at  risk  due  to  his  political
         activities to be lacking in credibility and implausible.

    (8)  The FTT did not believe  that  any  COI  officers  called  at  the
         appellant's  home  or  searched  his  house  and/or  threatened  or
         tortured  his  wife.   The  FTT  found  it  implausible  that   the
         appellant's wife would obtain a letter from the  vice  chairman  of
         OAUS regarding the appellant's membership, firstly because  of  the
         different font sized lettering shown in the document and  secondly,
         it was not accepted that the appellant would have  left  his  phone
         with his wife in Zimbabwe rather than taking it with him to the UK.
          If his phone had been left at his home it would be  expected  that
         the COI would have found it when searching the premises.

    (9)  The FTT did not accept that the appellant was an active member  of
         the OAUS or that since his arrival in the UK he was sought  by  the
         Zimbabwean authorities.  It was not accepted that  he  had  been  a
         political activist as claimed and/or that he would be at real  risk
         on return.

Grounds of Application

4.   In the grounds of application for permission to  appeal  the  appellant
    argued that the FTT failed to have regard to issues of risk  on  return
    based on the second limb of his claim  whether  having  regard  to  his
    circumstances he would be at risk on return to Zimbabwe on  account  of
    association  with  the  UK  based  civil  and   human   rights   groups
    organisations which continued to demonstrate support for the OAUS  i.e.
    imputed political opinion.

5.   It was contended that  the  FTT  confined  its  considerations  to  the
    evidence as to whether or not the appellant was a member of OAUS and/or
    whether his family had come to the adverse attention of the  CIO.   The
    FTT failed to consider the relevant question in  relation  to  risk  on
    return, namely whether the existence of the appellant's name associated
    with the OAUS would make him a person of adverse interest to the CIO on
    arrival at the airport given the relevant Google  search  results  show
    the appellant's name as the signatory of a  petition  in  the  name  of
    OAUSC.

6.   The second limb of his claim was set out in the grounds of  appeal  and
    skeleton argument and referred to background material  in  relation  to
    OAUS.   In that context the FTT failed  to  have  regard  to  the  risk
    category "being those seen to be  active  in  association"  with  human
    rights or civil society organisations where evidence suggests that  the
    particular organisation has been identified by  the  authorities  as  a
    critic or opponent  of  the  Zimbabwe  regime"  (HS  (Returning  asylum
    seekers) Zimbabwe CG [2007] UKAIT 00094.  Reliance  was  placed  on  AA
    (Zimbabwe) CG UKIAT 00061 at paragraphs 348 - 251.

Permission to Appeal

7.   Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  McDade
    on 7 April 2016 on the  grounds  that  the  FTT's  decision  failed  to
    include  consideration  of  the  relevant  country  guidance  case  law
    particularly HS (Returning asylum seekers) Zimbabwe.

Error of Law Hearing

8.   Miss Muzira relied on the grounds of application and  expanded  on  the
    same, arguing that the FTT in effect appeared to have accepted that the
    appellant had signed the petition which was in  the  public  domain  by
    carrying out a Google search of the appellant's name.  Accordingly  the
    FTT erred by failing to consider the position  in  those  circumstances
    vis-ï¿½-vis the risk of return to Zimbabwe.  The appellant could  not  be
    expected to lie and he would have to  admit  that  he  had  signed  the
    petition.  In any event the state authorities by reason of  the  Google
    search  entry  would  perceive  the  appellant  as  being  someone   in
    opposition to the current regime. The FTT erred by failing to  consider
    this evidence in light of the risk category identified in HS.  The  FTT
    should have considered what would happen at the airport in view of  the
    background evidence  linking  OAUS  with  various  civic  groups.   The
    appellant faced a real risk of being associated with and  perceived  to
    have links with that organisation in the UK.

9.   Mr Bramble relied on the Rule  24  response.   He  submitted  that  the
    FTT's consideration had to  be  looked  at  in  light  of  its  overall
    findings that the account in every respect lacked credibility.  The FTT
    made a clear finding that the appellant was not engaged  with  OAUS  as
    claimed.  The references made  to  the  Google  search  and  the  FTT's
    uncertainty as to what that search denoted had to be considered in  the
    light of the FTT's finding that the appellant was not involved  in  any
    activities or organisation at all.  Irrespective  of  what  the  Google
    search revealed there was no evidence that the appellant was active  in
    the group.  Mr Bramble submitted that the grounds had no merit and  the
    decision should stand.

10.  Miss Muzira agreed that the  FTT's  credibility  findings  as  to  past
    activities remained unchallenged.  The FTT failed to consider the issue
    of future risk and it was the perception of the authorities rather than
    the activities that formed the argument that the appellant  faced  risk
    on return for imputed political opinion.  She relied  on  the  COIR  at
    paragraphs 1.3.7 to 1.3.9 in concluding that  the  appellant  would  be
    perceived as being critical of the Zimbabwean regime.

Error of Law Decision

11.  Having considered the evidence  and  heard  submissions  I  found  that
    there was a material error of law in the Decision and Reasons.   Whilst
    accepting that the FTT properly found all aspects  of  the  appellant's
    claim to be lacking in credibility, I took the view that the FTT failed
    to go on to fully determine all of the relevant issues,  in  particular
    the second limb of the appellant's claim given the inconclusive finding
    about the Google search and the petition.  At [27] of the Decision  and
    Reasons the FTT acknowledged that a Google search reveals the appellant
    as a signatory to a petition by the OAUS.  The FTT failed  to  consider
    this issue in terms of future risk on  return  and  the  perception  by
    state authorities of the fact that the appellant had signed a petition.
    I set aside the decision and reasons. I preserve the findings  of  fact
    made by the FTT as summarised above. I heard  submissions  on  risk  on
    return.

Submissions for remaking the decision

12.  Both representatives addressed the particular issue of risk  on  return
    having regard to the evidence of the  Google  search  and  the  country
    guidance case of HS.  Miss Muzira submitted that whilst  the  appellant
    was not found to be active in Zimbabwe, there was every reason that  he
    would be called to the attention of the authorities at the airport.  It
    was known that the authorities obtain the  flight  passenger  lists  in
    advance  and  persons  of  interest  are  diverted  to  the   CIO   for
    questioning.   The authorities would therefore have access to a  Google
    search which revealed the appellant's name in association with OAUS,  a
    group which has substantial support in the UK and is perceived to be  a
    critic of the regime. The appellant would face  ill-treatment  contrary
    to Article 3.

13.  Mr Bramble submitted that the  Google  search  evidence  could  not  be
    relied on in isolation.  All of the findings made by the FTT had to  be
    taken into account in considering risk on return.  The FTT  made  clear
    findings that the appellant had no involvement in  any  activities  and
    there was no reason why he should come to the attention of the  CIO  as
    they had no previous interest in him.  There could  be  no  expectation
    that the appellant should have to lie to  the  authorities  as  it  was
    found that he was not associated with that group and therefore this was
    not an issue.  In the light of the clear findings  that  the  appellant
    was not a member of OAUS nor associated with the petition  there  could
    be no argument that the security searches would solely on the  basis of
    the Google search reach a conclusion  that  the  appellant  was  acting
    against the regime.

14.  Miss Muzira responded that the fact that the  appellant  had  signed  a
    petition was sufficient to lead to a real risk of ill-treatment.

15.  At the end of the hearing I reserved my decision.

Remaking of decision

16.  I rely on the main findings made by the First-tier  Tribunal  that  the
    appellant was found to be totally lacking  in  credibility  as  to  his
    membership of or involvement in OAUS and that he was  not  involved  in
    the petitioning process as claimed [25]. I find that having made  those
    clear findings the evidence of a Google search revealing the  appellant
    as a signatory to the petition by OAUS must be assessed in that context
    and not in isolation.  The FTT failed to consider  the  impact  that  a
    Google search would  have  in  terms  of  risk  on  return  but  simply
    concluded that it was not satisfied that the appellant was  engaged  in
    political activities as claimed.

17.  The head note in HS states

         "The Tribunal identifies one further  risk  category,  being  those
         seen to be active in association with human rights or civil society
         organisations  where   evidence   suggest   that   the   particular
         organisation has been identified as a critic  or  opponent  of  the
         Zimbabwean regime."

18.  The FTT found that the appellant was not a member of OAUS and  had  not
    suffered any ill-treatment as a result of any claimed activities  as  a
    member of that group. The FTT further found that the appellant  had  no
    involvement with any petition. It is accepted that the COI  take  steps
    to identify in advance from the passenger list those persons who may be
    of any possible interest.  It must be accepted that if a Google  search
    is conducted the appellant's name will appear as a signatory  alongside
    many other signatories.  However, there is no other  credible  evidence
    that the appellant was involved in anti regime activities in the UK  or
    Zimbabwe. There was no evidence before  the  FTT  that  the  i-petition
    actually existed and/or had in fact been handed in in October  2014  as
    claimed and/or that how and if the appellant would be  identified  from
    the name appearing as a signatory. The authorities search would  extend
    beyond that entry and reveal no political connection  or  profile.   Of
    significance is the fact that the appellant left Zimbabwe legally using
    his own passport with a visit visa and would have come to the attention
    of the authorities at that stage.  I find that the Google search  entry
    is insufficient on its own given the negative findings  of  credibility
    and would not give rise to referral onto the CIO where a real  risk  of
    ill treatment arises.  As indicated in the security  screening  process
    is intelligence led and if there was any  initial  questioning  of  the
    appellant this would not reveal any  political  profile  as  a  leader,
    activist or active supporter of the MDC. Further HS concluded that  the
    fact of having made a claim for asylum abroad is insufficient  to  lead
    to adverse interest, as is a return from the UK.

19.  Accordingly I am satisfied that the appellant  does  not  face  a  real
    risk of a second  stage  interrogation  which  would  lead  to  serious
    mistreatment to constitute a breach of  Article  3  (AA  (Zimbabwe)  CG
    UKIAT 00061).  I am further satisfied that  there  is  no  evidence  to
    indicate that having passed through the first stage  interview  at  the
    airport the appellant would be subject to monitoring in his  home  area
    by the local police or the CIO.  The Tribunal in AA further found  "the
    evidence  does  not  suggest  that  the  CIO  has   any   interest   in
    manufacturing or fabricating  evidence  to  create  suspicion  that  is
    otherwise absent" [250].

Decision

20.  I remake the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  by  dismissing  the
    appeal on asylum and human rights grounds for the reasons given  above.



21.  The appeal is dismissed.
