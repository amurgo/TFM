                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. For ease of reference, I shall refer to the parties as they were before
    the First-tier Tribunal. Thus, the Entry Clearance Officer is once more
    the Respondent and the three claimants (all of whom  are  siblings  and
    Pakistani nationals) revert to being the Appellants.

 2. This is an appeal by the Respondent against the decision of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Seifert (the judge), promulgated on 6 May 2015, in which
    she allowed the Appellants' appeals. These appeals had been against the
    Respondent's decisions of 21 November 2012, refusing entry clearance to
    join their father (the sponsor) in the United Kingdom  under  paragraph
    301 of the Immigration Rules (the Rules).

 3. In essence, the Appellants' application was based  upon  the  following
    claimed circumstances. Their parents divorced in 2008. Thereafter, they
    continued to live with their mother until early 2012. At this point the
    sponsor left Pakistan for the United Kingdom. The Appellants were moved
    to the sponsor's brother's household. They have  lived  with  him  ever
    since.

Procedural history

 4. These appeals were  first  heard  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  in
    January 2014. By a decision promulgated on 17 March that  year,  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge  Hussein  allowed  the  appeals  on  the  basis  of
    paragraph 301(i)(c) of the Rules. The Respondent obtained permission to
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal. By a decision promulgated on 21 May  2014
    Upper Tribunal Roberts set aside the First-tier Tribunal's decision  on
    the grounds of procedural  unfairness,  namely  that  consideration  of
    paragraph 301(i)(c) had not been brought to the Respondent's  attention
    at any time. The appeals were duly remitted to the First-tier  Tribunal
    for a complete rehearing.

The hearing before the judge

 5. The two issues under consideration on remittal were paragraph 301(i)(b)
    and (c). The judge heard evidence  from  the  sponsor,  his  wife  (the
    Appellants' step-mother), and the sponsor's landlord. She sets out  the
    evidence and submissions of the representatives. The actual findings on
    the relevant issues are contained in paragraphs 62-65 of her decision.

 6. The judge finds that paragraph  301(i)(b)  was  satisfied.  I  set  out
    paragraph 63 of her decision in full:
         "In reaching this conclusion I have had regard to the  decision  in
         TD (Paragraph 297(i)(e): "sole responsibility") Yemen [2006]  UKAIT
         00049 and  the  other  authorities  referred  to  in  the  skeleton
         arguments. What appears to have occurred on the facts  the  current
         case is that following his divorce from the appellants'  mother  in
         2008, the children lived with his former wife until events in  2012
         shortly before he came to the UK, when they went to live  with  his
         brother pending making applications to join Mr Tasaddiq in the  UK.
         The 'affidavit' of his former wife was not completed and not dated.
         This indicated that after the divorce the children  lived  with  Mr
         Tasaddiq. I have given this document very little weight.  That  the
         children lived with their mother  following  the  divorce  is  also
         supported by the evidence in the witness  statement  of  the  first
         appellant. I accept Mr Tasaddiq's evidence that his wife and  since
         early 2012 his brother have had day to day care of  the  appellants
         but that he has made all the important decisions in respect of  the
         children  as  referred  to  in  his  evidence.  He   has   provided
         maintenance for the appellants, including school fees. Leaving  the
         children temporarily in the care of his brother  whilst  he  joined
         Mrs Khan [the sponsor's second wife]  as  her  husband  in  the  UK
         pending the children joining him, does not in  my  view,  undermine
         the credibility of his evidence regarding his  involvement  in  and
         responsibility in connection with his children's upbringing."

 7. In paragraph 64 the judge finds that paragraph 301(i)(c) of  the  Rules
    was also met. She accepts that  the  attitude  of  the  mother  changed
    following the sponsor's remarriage, and that she no  longer  wanted  to
    care for the Appellants.

 8. The judge was satisfied that all other elements of paragraph  301  were
    met, in particular those relating to accommodation and maintenance.

 9. The appeals were all allowed under the Rules.

The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

10. The grounds of appeal make specific reference to  several  elements  of
    the judge's decision. Rather than setting them out here, I will address
    each when giving my reasons on the error of law issue, below.

11. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Reid on 2
    November 2015.

The hearing before me

12. There  was  an  initial  discussion  as  to  whether  the  Respondent's
    application for permission to appeal had been  out  of  time.  However,
    upon close inspection of the Tribunal's file, it  transpired  that  the
    IAFT-4 email inbox had been out of action during the  period  in  which
    the Respondent's application was made (by email). In light of this,  Ms
    Radford quite rightly accepted that the application should be  regarded
    as having been made in-time.

13. As regards the grounds themselves, Mr Kotas submitted that there was  a
    lack of reasoning and a failure to resolve conflicts in  the  evidence.
    There had been unresolved contradictory evidence on  the  accommodation
    issue and in respect of the sponsor's witness statements. In  terms  of
    sole responsibility, it was irrational to conclude that this element of
    paragraph 301 had been met. Mr Kotas suggested that  irrationality  was
    something different from perversity. The genuine Guardianship Order was
    post-decision.

14. Paragraph 8 of the grounds of appeal was specifically withdrawn  by  Mr
    Kotas and he did not seek to pursue the Child Benefit point in relation
    to the sponsor's wife.

15. Ms Radford submitted that there was no contradiction in the evidence on
    the landlord. In any  event,  this  was  immaterial  in  light  of  the
    property report. The judge dealt with the Guardianship Order  properly.
    The genuine document was an indication of the sponsor's intentions  all
    along. It was open to the  judge  to  find  as  she  did  on  paragraph
    301(i)(b). The grounds relating to the Child Benefit point were  wrong.
    In respect of paragraph 301(i)(c), given that children should  be  with
    one or both of their parents, it was open to the judge to  conclude  in
    the Appellants' favour on this issue. There was no irrationality in the
    decision at all.

16. In reply, Mr Kotas submitted that it  could  not  be  right  that  sole
    responsibility could have arisen from the point at which the Appellants
    went to live with their uncle. In addition, the judge had not  provided
    sufficient reasons.

Decision on error of law

Paragraph 301(i)(b)

17. I find that there are no material errors of law in respect of paragraph
    301(i)(b) of the Rules.

18. In so finding, I will deal with the various aspects of the Respondent's
    challenge in turn.

19. First, the alleged error in respect of Child Benefit and the  sponsor's
    wife in the United Kingdom has  quite  rightly  been  disavowed  by  Mr
    Kotas. Paragraphs 8 and 9 of the grounds are misconceived.

20. Second, contrary to what is said in paragraph 12 of  the  grounds,  the
    judge has not "clearly given  considerable  weight"  to  the  affidavit
    evidence. Indeed, she expressly states at paragraph  63  that  she  was
    attributing "very little weight" to  this  evidence,  and  rightly  so.
    There is nothing else to suggest that she then  did  in  fact  use  the
    affidavit to support her conclusions. In addition, paragraphs 12 and 13
    of the grounds overlook the fact that there was other  evidence  before
    the judge, namely that of the sponsor and first Appellant.

21. Third, it is right that there appeared to be  unidentified  differences
    between two witness statements  of  the  sponsor  (see  paragraph  11).
    However, neither the grounds nor Mr Kotas has indicated what these were
    or how they might have been material to the issues before the judge.

22. Fourth, it was open to the judge to find that  the  false  Guardianship
    Order  did  not  count  against  the  sponsor's   overall   credibility
    (paragraph 64). This conclusion must be read  in  the  context  of  the
    argument put forward by the Appellants' representative at  the  hearing
    (paragraph 61) and the fact  that  neither  the  Respondent's  original
    refusal notice nor the Presenting Officer relied upon paragraph 320(7A)
    of the Rules. Paragraph 10 of the grounds seeks to mount  a  perversity
    challenge without having considered the  nature  of  the  evidence  and
    submissions before the judge.

23. Fifth, the evidence relating to the landlord's living arrangements  did
    appear to be problematic. However, in my view it was immaterial to  the
    issues under paragraph 301(i)(b) and (c). Further, it was immaterial to
    the issue of accommodation as well, given that the property report of 4
    April 2012 stated there was sufficient room for seven persons to occupy
    the address and that no overcrowding would result from the  Appellants'
    arrival whether not the landlord resided there.  Paragraph  15  of  the
    grounds is inaccurate in this regard.

24. Sixth, the judge clearly had the relevant decision  of  TD  (Yemen)  in
    mind when reaching her findings and conclusions (see paragraph 63). The
    Respondent asserts that it was irrational (or perverse, there being  in
    reality no difference between the two) for the judge to  conclude  that
    the sponsor could ever have had sole responsibility  in  light  of  the
    living arrangements prior to the applications for entry clearance  (see
    paragraph 14 of the grounds and Mr Kotas' oral submissions).

25. With respect to the Respondent, her position in these appeals has  paid
    no regard to the contents of  TD  (Yemen)  itself.  As  is  clear  from
    paragraphs 35-42 and 45-48 of that decision,  sole  responsibility  can
    exist (albeit unusually) in cases where  the  appellants  have  resided
    with one parent in the country of origin.

26. Given the above and the fact that there was evidence from  the  sponsor
    as to the claimed sole responsibility  covering  the  period  when  the
    Appellants were with their mother and uncle (see paragraphs 33-34), the
    judge was entitled to reach the conclusion she  did  in  paragraph  63.
    There is nothing irrational here.

27. Mr Kotas' reliance on a reasons challenge to the judge's conclusions on
    the sole responsibility issue is  at  odds  with  the  wording  of  the
    grounds; he was in reality straying outwith them. In  any  event,  when
    the misconceived challenges I have dealt with already  are  taken  into
    account, and the actual contents of paragraph  63  are  considered  (in
    particular the final sentence thereof), the judge gave adequate reasons
    for accepting the sponsor's evidence.

Paragraph 301(i)(c)

28. I find that there are no material errors of law here either.

29. It would be right to say there was insufficient evidence upon which  to
    base a conclusion that serious and  compelling  "other  considerations"
    existed as at the date of the Respondent's decision. However,  as  with
    my assessment of the first issue,  above,  when  one  strips  away  the
    misconceived elements of challenge, the judge was entitled to  conclude
    that at least serious and compelling "family"  considerations  existed;
    and that is sufficient to  have  allowed  the  appeal  under  paragraph
    301(i)(c).

30. It  was  open  to  the  judge  to  find  that  the  Appellant's  mother
    effectively wanted nothing more to do with their care. It was also open
    to her to find that the arrangements with the uncle were of a temporary
    nature only. Given this and the importance of the children  being  with
    one or other of their parents in a suitable home  environment,  it  was
    open to the judge to ultimately conclude as she did.

Other elements of paragraph 301

31. In light of what I have said about certain elements of the Respondent's
    challenges, above, the judge was perfectly entitled  to  conclude  that
    all other aspects of the paragraph 301 were met.

32. There are no material errors of law in  the  judge's  decision  and  it
    therefore stands.

Anonymity

33. No direction was made by the First-tier Tribunal,  and  none  has  been
    sought from me. I make no direction.



Decision

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

The Entry Clearance Officer's appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeals  and  because  a  fee  has  been  paid  or  is
payable, I have considered making a fee award and have  decided  to  make  a
limited fee award of  �40.00  in  each  appeal.  This  is  because  material
evidence was not submitted until the appeal stage.
