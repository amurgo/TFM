For the Respondent:    Mrs Peterson a Home Office Presenting Officer


                             NOTICE AND REASONS

Background

      1. The Respondent refused the Appellant's application for a  Residence
         Card as an Extended Family Member (niece) on  17  March  2015.  Her
         appeal against this was  dismissed  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
         Turnock ("the Judge") following a hearing on 21 April 2016.  First-
         tier  Tribunal  Judge  Astle  granted  permission  to  appeal   (27
         September 2016).

      2. It is unnecessary for me to recite anything other than the briefest
         information in this matter  given  Sala  (EFMs:  Right  of  Appeal)
         [2016] UKUT 00411 (IAC) as there is no statutory  right  of  appeal
         against the decision not to grant a  Residence  Card  to  a  person
         claiming to be an Extended Family Member.

Discussion

    3. As explained in Sala, there was no statutory right  of  appeal,  and
       the Judge therefor had no appeal before him in which he could make a
       material error of law.

Decision:

    There is no valid appeal.

    I make no anonymity order as none was requested and it is not required.

Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Saffer
