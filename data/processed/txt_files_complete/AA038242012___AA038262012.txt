                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


     1. Following a hearing before Judge Coker on the 13th  March  2013  it
        was found that First-tier Tribunal Judge Saffer had made  an  error
        of law when dismissing the appellants' appeals against the  refusal
        of their claims for asylum and a variation of their leave to remain
        in the United Kingdom.


     2. The matter comes before me  following  the  making  of  a  judicial
        transfer order for the re-making of the decision.


     3. Judge Coker directed the following to be preserved findings:


     i.       The appellants' are Ahmadi.


     ii       The second appellant is from a family of Ahmadis some of  whom
          have been recognised as refugees due to their faith  and  some  of
          whom have died in Pakistan.


      iii.      The  sur  place  activities  of  the  appellants  have  been
   undertaken with a            view to bolstering their asylum claim   .


     iv.  The first appellant has  not  encouraged  anyone  in  Pakistan  to
   become              an Ahmadi.


     v.       There have been no findings as  to  what  the  appellant  will
   actually do             as a consequence of their faith.


     4. The current country guidance case in relation those of  the  Ahmadi
        faith is  MN and others  (Ahmadis  -  country  conditions  -  risk)
        Pakistan CG [2012] UKUT 00389(IAC) in which the Tribunal held:


     (i)  This country guidance  replaces  previous  guidance  in  MJ  &  ZM
   (Ahmadis - risk) Pakistan CG [2008] UKAIT 00033 and  IA  &         Others
   (Ahmadis Rabwah) Pakistan CG [2007] UKAIT 00088.       The  guidance  we
   give is based in part on the developments in       the law including  the
   decisions of the Supreme Court in HJ       (Iran) [2010]  UKSC  31, RT
   (Zimbabwe) [2012] UKSC 38 and         the CJEU decision in Germany  v.  Y
   (C-71/11) & Z (C-99/11). The           guidance  relates  principally  to
   Qadiani Ahmadis; but as the      legislation which is the  background  to
   the issues raised in these       appeals  affects  Lahori  Ahmadis  also,
   they too are included in         the country guidance stated below;


      (ii)  (a)      The  background  to  the  risk  faced  by  Ahmadis   is
   legislation  that  restricts   the   way   in   which   they   are   able
   openly   to   practise   their   faith.   The   legislation   not    only
   prohibits preaching and other forms of proselytising but             also
   in practice restricts other  elements  of  manifesting              one's
   religious  beliefs,  such  as  holding  open  discourse             about
   religion  with  non-Ahmadis,  although  not                 amounting  to
   proselytising. The prohibitions include             openly  referring  to
   one's place of worship as a  mosque             and  to  one's  religious
   leader as an Imam. In addition,           Ahmadis are  not  permitted  to
   refer to the call to prayer as            azan  nor  to  call  themselves
   Muslims or refer to their faith           as Islam. Sanctions  include  a
   fine and imprisonment and if              blasphemy is found, there is  a
   risk of the death penalty             which to date has not been  carried
   out although there is a               risk of  lengthy  incarceration  if
   the penalty is                        imposed.  There is clear  evidence
   that  this  legislation  is               used  by  non-state  actors  to
   threaten and harass Ahmadis.              This  includes  the  filing  of
   First Information Reports (FIRs)               (the  first  step  in  any
   criminal proceedings) which can            result  in  detentions  whilst
   prosecutions are being                pursued. Ahmadis are  also  subject
   to attacks by non-state               actors from sectors of the majority
   Sunni Muslim                 population;


     (ii) (b)     It is, and has long been, possible in general for  Ahmadis
   to             practise their faith  on  a  restricted  basis  either  in
   private  or               in  community  with  other   Ahmadis,   without
   infringing              domestic Pakistan law;


     (iii) (a) If an Ahmadi is able to demonstrate that it is of  particular
           importance  to   his   religious   identity   to   practise   and
   manifest  his   faith   openly   in   Pakistan   in   defiance   of   the
   restrictions    in    the    Pakistan    Penal    Code    (PPC)     under
   sections 298B and 298C, by engaging in behavior                 described
   in paragraph (ii)(a) above, he or she is  likely  to               be  in
   need of protection, in the light of the serious  nature                of
   the  sanctions  that  potentially  apply  as  well   as   the   risk   of
   prosecution under section 295C for blasphemy;


     (iii)(b)     It  is  no  answer  to  expect  an  Ahmadi  who  fits  the
       description   just   given   to   avoid   engaging    in    behaviour
   described   in    paragraph    (ii)(a)    above    ("paragraph    (ii)(a)
   behaviour") to avoid a risk of prosecution;


      (iv)      The  need  for  protection  applies  equally  to   men   and
   women. There is no basis for considering that Ahmadi            women  as
   a whole are at a particular or additional risk;             the  decision
   that they should not attend mosques                in Pakistan was made
   by  the  Ahmadi  Community                    following  attacks  on  the
   mosques in Lahore in 2010. There              is no evidence that women
   in particular were the target of              those attacks;


          (v)     In light of the above, the first  question  the  decision-
   maker          must ask is (1)  whether  the  claimant  genuinely  is  an
     Ahmadi. As with all judicial fact-finding the judge will           need
   to reach conclusions on all the evidence as  a  whole              giving
   such weight to aspects of that evidence  as                   appropriate
   in accordance with  Article  4  of  the                     Qualification
   Directive.  This is likely to include an                enquiry  whether
   the  claimant  was  registered   with   an             Ahmadi   community
   in Pakistan and worshipped and            engaged there  on  a  regular
   basis. Post-arrival activity will             also be relevant. Evidence
   likely to be relevant includes            confirmation from the UK Ahmadi
   headquarters                   regarding   the   activities   relied   on
   in Pakistan and                  confirmation from the local community in
   the UK where            the claimant is worshipping;


          (vi)    The next step (2) involves an enquiry into the  claimant's
          intentions  or  wishes  as  to  his  or  her  faith,  if  returned
      to Pakistan.  This  is   relevant   because   of   the   need   to
   establish   whether   it   is   of   particular   importance    to    the
   religious   identity   of   the   Ahmadi   concerned   to    engage    in
   paragraph (ii)(a) behaviour. The burden is on the  claimant            to
   demonstrate   that   any   intention   or   wish    to    practise    and
   manifest  aspects  of  the  faith   openly   that   are   not   permitted
   by  the  Pakistan  Penal  Code   (PPC)   is   genuinely   held   and   of
   particular importance to the claimant to preserve his or              her
   religious identity.  The decision maker needs to                evaluate
   all the evidence. Behaviour since arrival in                 the UK may
   also be relevant. If the claimant discharges           this burden he  is
   likely to be in need of protection;


          (vii)   The option of internal relocation,  previously  considered
   to             be available in Rabwah, is not in general reasonably  open
            to   a   claimant   who   genuinely   wishes   to    engage    n
   paragraph  (ii)(a)  behaviour,   in   the   light   of   the   nationwide
   effect in Pakistan of the anti-Ahmadi legislation;


          (viii) Ahmadis who are  not  able  to  show  that  they  practised
   their faith  at  all  in  Pakistan  or  that  they  did  so  on  anything
   other  than  the  restricted   basis   described   in   paragraph   2(ii)
   above  are  in  general  unlikely  to  be  able  to   show   that   their
   genuine   intentions   or   wishes   are   to   practise   and   manifest
   their  faith  openly  on  return,  as   described   in   paragraph   2(a)
   above;


          (ix)    A sur place claim  by  an  Ahmadi  based  on  post-arrival
   conversion   or   revival   in   belief   and   practice   will   require
   careful    evidential    analysis.    This    will    probably    include
   consideration   of   evidence   of   the   head   of    the    claimant's
   local United     Kingdom Ahmadi     Community     and      from
   the UK headquarters,  the  latter   particularly   in   cases   where
   there  has   been   a   conversion.   Any   adverse   findings   in   the
   claimant's   account   as   a   whole   may   be    relevant    to    the
   assessment of likely behaviour on return;


           (x)       Whilst  an  Ahmadi  who  has  been  found  to  be   not
   reasonably likely to engage or wish to engage in                paragraph
   2(a) behaviour is, in general, not at real risk on              return to
   Pakistan, judicial fact-finders may in certain              cases need to
   consider  whether  that  person  would                  nevertheless   be
   reasonably likely to be targeted by non-           state actors on return
   for religious persecution by reason           of his/her prominent social
   and/or business profile.



Discussion



     5. The answer to the first question "whether the claimant genuinely is
        an        Ahmadi" has to be answered in the affirmative.  It  is  a
        preserved finding that the  appellants  are  Ahmadi  and  that  the
        second appellant is from a prominent Ahmadi family.


     6.  In relation to the second question, the appellants  intentions  or
        wishes as to his or  her  faith,  if  returned  to Pakistan,  both
        appellants attend prayers, the evidence of the first  appellant  is
        that he has told others about his faith  whilst  in  Pakistan  [A's
        appeal bundle to the UT, page 6 para 6]. The first appellant's oral
        evidence regarding the Tabligh (spreading the message)  shows  this
        is of importance to him which will place him at risk  in  light  of
        the Anti-Ahmadi legislation in Pakistan.


     7. I accept the evidence that the first appellant has been  active  in
        the United Kingdom which is an indicator for how he would  wish  to
        act if has able to do so on return. In his witness  statement  [A's
        bundle, page 6, para  7]  he  states  he  would  not  initially  in
        conversation in Pakistan admit he was Ahmadi as he would have  been
        arrested. It was only if a person showed an interest in  his  faith
        that he would discuss  the  matter  further.  In  paragraph  13  he
        states:


              13. I am able to openly preach in the UK. There is no sense of
   fear that I                  will be arrested,  imprisoned  or  tortured.
   In Pakistan there was a                   constant fear for my  life  and
   the lives of my family.  In Pakistan if I                   was to openly
   speak to someone about the faith, they may report  me                  to
   the police I  would  face  arrest  and  imprisonment.   As  a  result  my
     family and I are not able to live freely in Pakistan.


     8. There is evidence to corroborate the claim by the second  appellant
        that her younger brother Ali Ahmad has been granted refugee  status
        in the United Kingdom as has her  maternal  uncle  and  his  family
        based upon their religion as Ahmadi.


     9. I find the evidence relating to religious activities in the  United
        Kingdom, the evidence the first appellant was  unable  to  practice
        and speak of his faith openly in Pakistan as a result of a fear  of
        persecution, and the evidence that but for the  on  going  fear  he
        would wish to continue to speak about his faith and  be  active  in
        spreading the word about his faith in the future if returned, to be
        credible. The letter from the Ahmadiyya  Association  confirms  the
        first appellant's sur place activities.


    10. I also take into account the fact the second appellant  is  from  a
        high profile Ahmadi family, members of whom have been recognised as
        refugees.


    11. I am satisfied the appellants have substantiated their claim to  be
        entitled to be recognised as refugees in light of MN. I  find  they
        face a real risk of harm sufficient to  amount  to  persecution  on
        account of their religious  identity  from  which  the  state  will
        provide no protection.


Decision

    12. The First-tier Tribunal Judge has been  found  to  have  materially
        erred in law and his determination set aside. I remake the decision
        as follows. This appeal is allowed.


   Anonymity.


    13. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005.


          I make no  such  order  as  there  was  no  application  made  for
   anonymity and no        grounds established for such an order.
