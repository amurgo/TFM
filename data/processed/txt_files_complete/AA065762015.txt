Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms A Radford of Counsel instructed by J D Spicer Zeb
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a citizen  of  Afghanistan  born  on  [  ]  1992.   He
    arrived in this country on 25 January  2007  and  applied  for  asylum.
    This application was  refused  on  10  May  2007  but  he  was  granted
    discretionary leave to remain until 2 June 2009 when he  would  be  17ï¿½
    years old.  The applicant made an in time  application  to  extend  his
    leave but this application was not decided until 30  March  2015.   The
    appellant appealed the decision and his appeal came before a First-tier
    Judge on 6 October 2015.  The judge dismissed the appeal in a  decision
    promulgated on 30 October 2015.

2.   The appellant applied for permission to appeal in  grounds  settled  by
    Ms Radford.  It was and is submitted that the judge made a  fundamental
    mistake in his view of the chronology in paragraph 89 of  the  decision
    where, having referred to the appellant's application in May  2009,  he
    states as follows:

         "That application was refused  on  13  November  2009  however  the
         appellant made  a  further  application  on  15  March  2013.   The
         covering letter from his solicitors again set out  the  appellant's
         claim that his  father  had  been  accused  of  planning  terrorist
         activities against  the  government  officials  in  Kabul  and  was
         accused of being involved with Hezb-e-Islami.  It goes on to  state
         that the appellant is of the view that someone had been  spying  on
         his father and had informed the authorities  that  his  father  was
         working for Hezb-e-Islami."

3.   Counsel points out in paragraph 11 of  the  grounds  that  it  was  the
    undisputed position that the November  2009  decision  had  never  been
    served.  The application under consideration and appeal was accordingly
    not dated 15 March 2013 as the judge had surmised but 26 May 2009.   In
    paragraph 143, for example, the judge finds it relevant  to  note  that
    the respondent did issue a reasons for refusal dated 12  November  2009
    in relation to the application of 26 May 2009 and in paragraph  144  he
    stated as follows:

         "Although there may have been a delay in the appellant's case being
         finally  resolved  the  appellant  has  been  made  aware  by   the
         respondent that they did not accept his  case  throughout  and  was
         aware from the refusal in November 2009 that they  did  not  accept
         his further submissions at that time."

4.   Counsel makes the point  that  the  appellant  did  not  know  of  this
    refusal as it had not been served.

5.   The application made in May 2009 had been  outstanding  for  six  years
    and this had a  bearing  on  the  proportionality  of  the  appellant's
    removal.  The respondent had breached her statutory duties relating  to
    children and she had not properly considered her  discretionary  policy
    under chapter 53 enforcement instructions and guidance.  The  applicant
    fell within the discretionary policy and the  appellant's  case  should
    have been decided under the transitional arrangements.  In relation  to
    Article 8 the delay in  considering  an  in  time  application  was  of
    significance in the light of EB (Kosovo) v Secretary  of  State  [2008]
    UKHL  41.   The  judge  had  accepted  that  there  would  clearly   be
    considerable hardship to the  appellant  were  he  to  be  expected  to
    establish himself in Kabul.  The mistake of fact in this case  amounted
    to an error of law.

6.   The second ground advanced by Counsel related to the  judge's  findings
    on risk on return.  The judge found that if the appellant did not  wish
    to return to his home area he could relocate,  for  example  to  Kabul.
    The judge refers to AK (Afghanistan)  [2012]  UKUT  00163  (IAC).   The
    judge states in paragraph 135  that  he  had  taken  into  account  the
    findings in Naziri [2015] UKUT 437 but this was a case involving  fresh
    claims and the further evidence considered in Naziri was not  the  same
    as the evidence before the First-tier Judge.   The  evidence  postdated
    the evidence  before  the  Upper  Tribunal  in  Naziri.   Moreover  the
    appellant belonged to an enhanced risk category  even  if  the  country
    guidance case of AK remained good guidance.  The appellant was arguably
    more vulnerable by having had no experience of  living  in  Afghanistan
    since the age of 14, some nine years previously.   He  had  no  contact
    with his family in Kabul and was not currently in contact  with  anyone
    there.

7.   Ms Radford relied on the grounds and the skeleton argument  before  the
    First-tier  Tribunal.   The  delay  in  this  case  impacted   on   the
    respondent's  policies  and  the  applicable  rules.   The  judge   had
    proceeded on the assumption that the appellant had overstayed for  four
    years and had applied as an adult.  There  had  in  fact  been  a  very
    significant period of delay and the appellant's discretionary leave had
    continued throughout and had not been brought to an end in 2009 as  the
    judge had appeared to think.

8.   The delay had a material impact  on  Article  8  as  submitted  in  the
    grounds.  Although  it  was  said  there  had  been  deception  it  was
    significant that the appellant had been of a young age and had  arrived
    as an unaccompanied asylum seeker.   It  was  not  the  case  that  the
    appellant could not succeed whatever the delay because his  status  had
    been precarious.  The decision had not been lawful  because  the  wrong
    Immigration Rules  had  been  applied  and  the  interference  was  not
    necessary.  The appellant had established a private life because of the
    failure of the respondent to act lawfully.  The respondent had taken no
    steps to trace the appellant's parents  between  2007  and  2009.   The
    appellant had developed private life over  six  years.   Account  would
    have to be taken of the appellant's age.  He had  been  15  when  given
    leave to  remain  and  17  when  he  had  made  the  application  under
    consideration.  The appellant had been chasing up the Home Office for a
    decision.

9.   In relation to the second ground Naziri had been upheld in  HN  and  SA
    (Afghanistan) v Secretary of State [2016] EWCA Civ 123 but it  remained
    the case that this was a judicial review on  Wednesbury  grounds.   The
    judge had been in error in saying  that  the  Tribunal  had  considered
    further evidence - the judge appeared to have considered the case as an
    appeal rather than  a  review  case.   Furthermore  as  stated  in  the
    grounds, the further evidence considered in Naziri was not the same  as
    the further evidence submitted in this case.  All the evidence in  this
    case postdated the evidence given in Naziri.  The judge needed to  look
    at the recent evidence.  The appellant would be at particular risk  and
    none of his vulnerabilities had been addressed.

10.  Mr Avery submitted there had been no material  error  of  law  although
    there might have been a mistake in relation to the  decision  in  2009.
    The appellant never had had a legitimate basis of stay in the  UK.   He
    had always known from the outset that he had been given leave to remain
    as a minor.  His claim had been rejected at that stage.  His  stay  was
    clearly precarious.  Section 117B provided that little weight should be
    given to a private life established by a person at a  time  when  their
    immigration status  was  precarious.   The  appellant's  situation  was
    always precarious and he had known that.  There was nothing to indicate
    that the appellant's family were not in their home area  as  the  judge
    had found in paragraph 152 of his decision.  The findings made  by  the
    judge were perfectly sound.  The judge had  dealt  with  the  issue  of
    tracing and contact with family members in paragraphs 129 to 131 of the
    decision.  The matter should be considered under the current Rules  and
    there were no transitional provisions.  The  case  of  Naziri  did  not
    disturb the existing country guidance.

11.  Ms Radford submitted in reply  that  the  transitional  provisions  had
    been dealt with in her skeleton argument at paragraph 42.   People  who
    had been granted limited leave to  remain  before  2012  were  to  have
    applications to vary that leave considered  in  line  with  the  Asylum
    Policy Instruction.  The respondent should have asked  herself  whether
    circumstances had changed so that discretionary  leave  was  no  longer
    warranted.  The treatment of the appellant's Article 8 application  was
    based on the wrong questions which were unnecessarily restrictive.  The
    date of the application had long  preceded  the  2012  changes  to  the
    Rules.  The appellant had  the  right  to  remain  until  his  in  time
    application had been decided and he could not realistically be expected
    to return.

12.  At the conclusion of the submissions I reserved my decision.  I can  of
    course only interfere with the judge's decision if  it  was  materially
    flawed in law.  It is clear from the extracts which Ms  Radford  refers
    to in her grounds that the judge did not appear to have appreciated the
    significance of the fact that the 13 November 2009 had not been served.
     As far as the appellant was concerned he had made  an  application  in
    time in May 2009 and this application had not been decided until  2015.
    The judge appears clearly to have  proceeded  on  the  basis  that  the
    application in May 2009 was refused on 13 November 2009  and  paragraph
    144 of the decision makes it clear that the judge considered  that  the
    appellant "was aware from the refusal in November  2009  they  did  not
    accept his further submissions at that time."

13.  This does appear to me to be a fundamental mistake in the light of  the
    point that appears to have been accepted between the parties that  that
    decision was not served.

14.  There was an undoubted lengthy delay in the appellant's application  in
    2009 being dealt with and this clearly impacts on  the  development  of
    the appellant's private life as stated in EB  (Kosovo).   Other  points
    are argued by Counsel in  relation  to  the  policy  and  guidance  and
    tracing duty.  Because of what appears to be an important error in  the
    analysis given by the judge to the chronology of  the  events  in  this
    case the significance of the arguments were not appreciated.

15.  In relation to the risk facing the appellant on  return  I  accept  the
    criticisms made about the consideration  of  the  appellant's  evidence
    which was not the same as that considered in Naziri.   Moreover  Naziri
    was a judicial review case, as Counsel points out.

16.  Despite having taken into account the clear  and  forceful  submissions
    made by Mr Avery I note that the appellant was a child when he  arrived
    and made an application as a child and great care has to be taken  when
    considering such applications.  There was on any view a  lengthy  delay
    in considering this application.  The judge did not approach matters on
    the correct factual basis.

17.  Counsel submitted that because of the degree of  fact-finding  required
    the matter should be remitted for redetermination on all  grounds.   Ms
    Radford made it clear in paragraph 17 of her grounds of appeal that she
    did not challenge the findings that the appellant was not  of  interest
    to the authorities or the Taliban.  Those findings were not infected by
    the error of law.

18.  For the reasons I have given and in the light  of  the  extent  of  the
    fact-finding required it is appropriate that this  appeal  be  remitted
    for a fresh hearing before a different First-tier Judge.
