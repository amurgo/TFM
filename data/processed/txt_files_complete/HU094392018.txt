                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal to the Upper Tribunal by  the  Appellant,  permission
    having been granted by Judge Hollingworth on 27th  December  2018.   It
    relates to a Decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Wylie promulgated on
    23rd November 2018 in which she dismissed the Appellant's appeal.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 2nd  February  1985.  He
    had applied for indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom, which
    application was refused by the Secretary of State on 6th April 2018.

 3. The appellant first entered the UK in September  2006  with  a  student
    visa valid until October 2008.  He  made  an  in-time  application  for
    further leave to remain as a highly skilled migrant which  was  granted
    until July 2011. He then made a further in time application as a Tier 1
    general migrant which was granted  until  June  2013.  That  leave  was
    successfully extended until June 2016. He made an  in-time  application
    for indefinite leave to remain on 9th June 2016 as  a  Tier  1  general
    migrant but then varied that application, in April  2017,  to  one  for
    indefinite leave to remain on the basis of his long residence.

 4. The application was refused under paragraph 322 (5) of the  Immigration
    Rules because the Secretary  of  State  had  ascertained  that  he  had
    declared two different figures  to  UKVI  and  HMRC  in  terms  of  his
    earnings. The Secretary of State concluded that the appellant had  been
    deceitful or dishonest in his dealings with either  HMRC  or  UKVI  and
    that it would be undesirable for him to remain in the United Kingdom.

 5. The appellant appealed and his appeal came before Judge  Wylie  sitting
    at Hatton  Cross  on  1st  November  2018.  Mr  Biggs  represented  the
    appellant then as now. Judge Wylie  did  not  have  the  benefit  of  a
    representative from the Home Office. She found that the  provisions  of
    paragraph  322(5)  were  met,  that  it  was  undesirable   given   the
    appellant's conduct, to grant him leave to remain in the United Kingdom
    and taking into  account  the  requirements  of  section  117B  of  the
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, dismissed the appeal on  human  rights
    grounds.

 6. The grounds upon which permission to appeal was granted were drafted by
    Mr Biggs. The first ground of appeal is an allegation of an  inadequacy
    of reasoning. It asserted that the judge  failed  to  provide  adequate
    reasons for her conclusion that the Secretary of State  had  discharged
    the evidential burden,  failed  to  acknowledge  the  need  for  cogent
    evidence of dishonesty before the respondent could discharge the  legal
    burden, failed to make any separate and  sustainable  findings  on  the
    appellant's credibility having regard to all material  matters  and  in
    failing to give significant weight to HMRC's decision not to  take  any
    adverse action against the appellant.

 7. The second ground is essentially a restatement  of  the  first.  It  is
    argued that, although the standard of proof for dishonesty is a balance
    of probabilities, there nevertheless needs to be cogent evidence.

 8. Ground three asserts that the judge has given no clear findings on  the
    appellant's credibility; there is no separate reasoned consideration of
    the appellant's credibility.

 9. The fourth ground asserts that factual errors have  been  made  by  the
    Judge, in particular she found that the accountants  had  not  admitted
    culpability whereas it was at least arguable that one of them  had.  It
    is asserted that  the  judge  had  not  engaged  with  the  appellant's
    evidence that the tax returns were submitted online and  therefore  did
    not require his  signature  and  there  was  no  sufficiently  reasoned
    consideration of why the appellant's account was not accepted.

10. It is asserted the fact that the judge did not  attach  weight  to  the
    fact that HMRC had decided  not  to  impose  any  penalty  was  also  a
    material error of law and in that regard Mr Biggs relied on a  guidance
    published by the Secretary of State, since the Decision and Reasons was
    promulgated, indicating that HMRC will take action in such cases.

11. With regard to the allegation of inadequacy of  reasons,  reliance  was
    placed on MK (duty to give reasons) Pakistan [2013] UKUT 00641 (IAC).

12. Mr Biggs also relied on a Court of Session  case,  Collins  and  Ishoma
    against the Secretary of State for the Home Department [2018] CSOH  127
    and in particular paragraph 30 thereof where the Court of Session found
    the Secretary of State to be at fault for not affording the  petitioner
    an  opportunity  to  explain  why  there  were  two  different  figures
    submitted to UKVI and HMRC.

13. Dealing with the last point first, the Court of Session case was a case
    taken in relation to the Secretary of State's decision. It was  not  an
    appeal. The issue there was that the decision that the petitioners  had
    been dishonest was made without them having the opportunity to respond.
    The Secretary of State made no such error in the present  case  because
    the Letter of Refusal sets  out  the  appellant's  explanation.  It  is
    written there that, in  question  14  of  the  tax  questionnaire,  the
    appellant was asked whether he had ever needed to correct  or  resubmit
    tax returns during any period of his self-employment. He had said  that
    he had needed to correct his tax returns for the  years  2010/2011  and
    2012/2013 as his accountant had submitted wrong figures. He had, it  is
    written, stated that there was a lack of coordination between  him  and
    his accountant and that he was busy in his employment at the  time.  He
    also explained that the accountant had submitted his tax returns online
    on his behalf.

14.  Turning  to  the  adequacy  of  reasons  generally  and  the   judge's
    consideration of this appeal, the Decision and Reasons is  lengthy  and
    detailed. It sets out the issues in considerable detail. In  particular
    it sets out that in an application for Tier 1 general migrant status in
    April 2011  the  appellant  claimed  earnings  of  �34,514  from  self-
    employment and �7,520 from employment. In the application in  May  2013
    the appellant claimed earnings of �29,930 from self-employment for  the
    period May 2012 to May 2013 and �23,298.15 from employment. The  income
    claimed was sufficient for him to score the necessary points to  obtain
    leave.

15. The Secretary of State's checks carried out with HMRC  showed  that  in
    his original tax return for the year  2010/2011  he  declared  a  total
    income of only �6,475 and for the tax year 2012/2013 �24,528.

16. The appellant then, in February 2016, wrote to HMRC to  amend  the  tax
    return for the year 2010 2011 to declare a total income of �41,201  and
    in January he had amended the tax return for 2012/2013  to  declare  an
    income of �40,368.

17. The judge set out the appellant's explanation as set out in his witness
    statement and oral evidence. His explanation was that he had instructed
    accountants to prepare his tax return and he had  sent  them  his  bank
    statements, invoices, P 60 and expenditure details. He was very busy in
    his employment during the busy period of Christmas and New Year. He had
    not visited his accountant and was not aware about the details  of  the
    tax return which had been submitted online.

18. It is then set out that he went to see his accountant in  October  2015
    asking him  to  check  his  past  records  and  found  there  to  be  a
    discrepancy in the total amounts declared in the  years  2010/2011  and
    2012/2013. Amended  returns  were  then  submitted  and  a  demand  for
    additional tax made  in  respect  of  each  of  the  years,  which  the
    appellant paid in February 2016.

19. The appellant explained that he had instructed AS Associates, chartered
    certified accountants to prepare accounts to show his earnings when his
    visa application was lodged in April 2011 and also to  submit  his  tax
    return for that year. For his visa application in  2013  he  instructed
    another firm, Riz & Co, who  had  been  recommended  by  a  friend,  to
    prepare his accounts for the purpose of the visa application. He  could
    not remember if he had instructed them to prepare  and  lodge  his  tax
    return. There was a mistake in the tax return. He did not like Riz & Co
    and returned to AS Associates.

20. The person that he had dealt with at AS Associates had  left  the  firm
    before October 2015. He said that when he went  to  AS  Associates  and
    discovered there had been a mistake in  the  tax  return,  the  manager
    agreed, as a goodwill gesture, to prepare and submit the amended return
    without charge. He made no formal complaint about the accountants.

21. The judge then set out Mr Biggs' submissions namely  that  the  correct
    approach was first to establish whether there had been  dishonesty.  He
    submitted that refusal under paragraph 322(5) was a draconian provision
    and it must be shown  that  the  appellant's  presence  in  the  United
    Kingdom is undesirable. He also reminded the judge that the  burden  of
    proof was on  the  respondent  who  must  provide  cogent  evidence  to
    discharge the evidential burden and only then is the appellant required
    to give an explanation.

22. He submitted  that  the  appellant  was  a  credible  witness  who  had
    explained in candid and clear detail that he had not known the mistakes
    had been made. He had relied on his accountant  and  subsequently  paid
    the tax properly  due.  The  discrepancy,  he  argued,  for  the  years
    2012/2013 was around �4000 and for 2010/2011 less than �10,000.

23. Mr Biggs had referred the judge to a letter from the accountants which,
    he argued, confirmed that the errors had been found and been corrected.
    The accountants accepted their fault and had not charged the  appellant
    for the work required to rectify the returns

24. Mr Biggs also relied on the fact that HMRC accepted the payment of  tax
    due and had not imposed any penalty, which, he argued, was an important
    point. He submitted that  as  experts  in  tax  affairs,  if  HMRC  had
    considered there  had  been  dishonesty,  they  would  have  imposed  a
    penalty.

25. The judge commenced her findings at paragraph 31 by  reminding  herself
    of the burden and standard of proof and of the applicable law.

26. She noted that the appellant accepted that incorrect earnings had  been
    presented to HMRC and found that the respondent  had  met  the  initial
    burden of proof which meant there  was  an  evidential  burden  on  the
    appellant to show an innocent explanation for his  actions.  I  do  not
    find that to be inadequately reasoned, the judge having previously  set
    out what lay behind the Secretary of State's conclusion. Mr Biggs  said
    there needed to be cogent evidence  but  in  this  case  the  appellant
    accepted that incorrect figures had been sent to HMRC.  The  difference
    between what he claimed as earnings to UKVI and  what  he  declared  to
    HMRC for the period 2010/11 was �34,726 and for 2012/2013 �15,840;  not
    insignificant  amounts.  Furthermore,  in  the  case  of  R   (on   the
    application of Khan) v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
    (dishonesty, tax return, paragraph 322(5)) [2018] UKUT 00384 (IAC)  the
    first paragraph of the head note states:-

         "Where there has been a significant difference between  the  income
         claimed in a previous application  for  leave  to  remain  and  the
         income declared to HMRC, the Secretary of State is entitled to draw
         an inference that the appellant has been deceitful or dishonest and
         therefore should be refused ILR within paragraph  322  (5)  of  the
         immigration rules. Such an inference could be expected where  there
         is no plausible explanation for the discrepancy".

27. The submission that there was  no  cogent  evidence  in  this  case  is
    unattractive and I find no error of law in that regard.

28. The judge then went on to  consider  the  appellant's  explanation.  He
    blamed his accountants. She noted that  AS  Associates  had  written  a
    letter dated October 2017 which  indicated  that  the  firm  had  found
    errors in the tax returns and they rectified the error for both  years.
    She also noted however that they had not accepted any liability for the
    mistake or identified how the error had occurred. She noted that  there
    was no information at all how the errors had been made. The  judge  did
    not accept the appellant's  oral  evidence  that  the  accountants  had
    accepted the error and not charged him for rectification as  a  gesture
    of goodwill. Apart from his assertion, there was no other  evidence  to
    that effect. The judge found that it did not  seem  credible  that  two
    separate firms  of  professionally  qualified  accountants  would  make
    similar mistakes in completion of tax returns when those returns  would
    have been  prepared  on  the  basis  of  information  provided  by  the
    appellant. She did not accept the explanation given  by  the  appellant
    that he had been busy in his work between Christmas and New  Year.  She
    noted that the appellant would have been fully aware  as  he  completed
    his visa application what his self-employed and employed earnings  were
    and therefore should also have been aware  that  he  should  have  paid
    considerably more tax than he had. She noted that  the  appellant  must
    have known that he had earned sufficient to  meet  the  financial  visa
    requirements and must have been aware that tax was required to be paid.

29. The judge noted  that  while  the  appellant  provided  a  quantity  of
    documentation to support his earnings for the year 2015/2016 he had not
    done so in relation to the years 2010/2011 or 2012/2013, the  years  in
    question.

30. On that basis the judge found that the Secretary of State had  met  the
    burden to show that there had  been  dishonesty  on  the  part  of  the
    appellant.

31. The judge noted at paragraph 52 that HMRC had not imposed  any  penalty
    for late payment of tax due but noted that she had no information about
    what HMRC considered when making such a decision and gave little weight
    to that fact.

32. Overall the Judge's reasoning and conclusions were  perfectly  in  line
    with the wisdom of Khan. The judge had to decide whether the  appellant
    had been dishonest or only careless and came to the conclusion that  he
    had been dishonest and not merely careless. That is unsurprising  given
    the size of the discrepancy, the length of the time the  appellant  had
    been in the UK and therefore his knowledge of UK law and also the  fact
    that he only rectified the situation with HMRC very shortly  before  he
    made his application for indefinite leave to remain, in  the  knowledge
    that the Secretary of State would check  HMRC's  figures.  That  was  4
    years after the first incorrect figures were supplied to HMRC.

33. The judge was entitled to attach no weight to the fact  that  HMRC  did
    not impose any penalty. As she rightly pointed out,  she  was  provided
    with no evidence as to what  factors  HMRC  take  into  account  before
    making such decisions. Whilst Mr Biggs provided guidance from the  Home
    Office suggesting that HMRC would indeed take such action, that did not
    exist at the date of the hearing before Judge Wylie. Cases such as this
    one have become common in this Tribunal and  rarely  have  any  of  the
    appellant's concerned had penalties imposed by HMRC. We do not know the
    reason. It may simply be that the error having been pointed out by  the
    taxpayer himself and the tax having been paid it would not be practical
    or  economic  to  pursue  matters  any  further.   However,   that   is
    speculation. The truth is we do not know and for that reason alone  the
    judge was entitled to attach no weight to it.  It would no doubt assist
    judges in future if the Secretary of State made enquiries of HMRC as to
    what they consider when deciding whether to impose penalties

34. For all of the above reasons I find that the decision of Judge Wylie is
    a detailed and thorough assessment of all of the evidence applying  the
    law and burden and standard of proof correctly. On the evidence in this
    case,  indeed  any  other  result  would  have  been  surprising.   The
    appellant can be in no doubt why he lost his appeal.

Decision

35. The Decision and Reasons of the First-tier Tribunal  does  not  contain
    any material errors of law and the appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  is
    dismissed.

36. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction and  I  see
    no justification for one.
