                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant was born on 10 April  1996  and  is  a  male  citizen  of
    Poland. He came to the United Kingdom when he was 12 years old in  July
    2008. He was cautioned for common assault on 30 March 2014 and, at Mold
    Crown Court on 12 June 2008, he was convicted of burglary and sentenced
    to 12 months imprisonment and ordered to  pay  a  victim  surcharge  of
    ï¿½140. By a decision dated 10  October  2018,  the  Secretary  of  State
    decided to  deport  the  appellant  subject  to  section  5(1)  of  the
    Immigration Act 1971. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal
    which, in a decision promulgated on 14  February  2019,  dismissed  the
    appeal. The appellant  now  appeals,  with  permission,  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 2.  The  grant  permission  is  problematic.  In  parts,  it   is   barely
    intelligible. It appears to make little, if any, reference  at  all  to
    the grounds of appeal in a manifest failure to follow the  guidance  of
    AZ (error of law: jurisdiction; PTA  practice)  Iran  [2018]  UKUT  245
    (IAC).

 3. The suggestion in the grant of permission  that  the  appellant  should
    have been treated as a vulnerable witness  is  without  any  foundation
    whatever. It is the case that the appellant was not legally represented
    both before the First-tier Tribunal and the  Upper  Tribunal.  However,
    the appellant presented as an intelligent young man who plainly  had  a
    thorough grasp of the proceedings in which he was involved.  He  cannot
    legitimately be described as vulnerable in  any  way  at  all.  Indeed,
    before me he made no complaint whatever of the conduct  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal or, indeed, any reference to the grant of permission.

 4. The grounds themselves make a number of points, none of  which  possess
    arguable merit. First, the appellant complains that the  judge  made  a
    factual error by finding [49] that the appellant had denied the offence
    of burglary. The judge made no such error. The judge was aware from the
    papers that the appellant had changed  his  plea  from  not  guilty  to
    guilty.  Secondly,  the  grounds  discuss  the  appellant's   risk   of
    reoffending. Nothing the judge has said contradicts the evidence before
    him. The appellant claims that his circumstances have altered but, as I
    explained  to  the  appellant  at  the  initial  hearing,  post-hearing
    developments in his circumstances cannot constitute an error of law  in
    the First-tier Tribunal decision. He openly acknowledged that that  was
    the case. Likewise, what the  grounds  say  regarding  the  appellant's
    relationship with his girlfriend were duly addressed by  the  judge  in
    his findings at [48] et seq. Nothing arising from that relationship  is
    capable of giving rise to an arguable appeal on human  rights  grounds.
    The judge recorded that the girlfriend and the appellant's  mother  did
    not attend the hearing to give  evidence  [55].  The  question  of  the
    appellant's mother's medical condition appears to been raised  for  the
    first time in the grounds to the Upper Tribunal. It was not before  the
    First-tier Tribunal. It  is  difficult  to  see  how,  therefore,  that
    question may be relevant in deciding whether there is an error  of  law
    in the First-tier Tribunal's decision. In any event, the grounds do not
    explain how the  mother's  condition  should  prevent  the  appellant's
    deportation.

 5. In conclusion, there is nothing in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  decision
    which indicates that the judge has erred in law. The appellant does not
    dispute the judge's finding that he had not exercised Treaty Rights for
    a  period  of  five  years  [52].  The  judge's  conclusion  that   the
    appellant's deportation is  justified  on  serious  grounds  of  public
    policy or  public  security  was,  on  the  facts  as  he  found  them,
    unimpeachable. The appellant told me that his grandmother has  recently
    died. The judge found at [54] that  the  appellant  would  be  able  to
    return to live  with  his  grandmother  in  Poland.  That  finding  was
    unarguably sound at the time it was  made.  In  any  event,  given  the
    appellant's evident capabilities, there is no reason at all to  suppose
    that he would not integrate into Polish society should he have to do so
    without the assistance of family members living there.

 6. In the circumstances, the appeal is dismissed.

 7. Notice of Decision

    This appeal is dismissed.
