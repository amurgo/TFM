                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    The appellant, a citizen of Sierra Leone,  appeals  the  determination
      of an Adjudicator, Mr J R L G Varcoe, CMG, who  dismissed  his  appeal
      against  the  decision  of  the  Secretary  of  State  to  refuse  his
      application for asylum.

2.    The appellant is represented by Miss E Storey  of  the  Refugee  Legal
      Centre and Mr D Saville appears for the Secretary of State.

3.    One of the  principle  grounds  of  appeal  is  that  the  Adjudicator
      reached findings based on his own personal  knowledge  without  giving
      the appellant the opportunity to comment on that  personal  knowledge.
      It was part of the appellant's case that he  had  been  befriended  by
      UNICEF after an escape. He had met people who had escorted him to  the
      UNICEF compound. There he had met one of the locally engaged staff and
      after he had explained what had happened to him this  UNICEF  employee
      had allowed him to  stay  for  about  1  week.    The  Adjudicator  in
      paragraph 24 of his determination recorded that  he  must  declare  an
      indirect interest in  the  sense  that  he  was  aware  from  personal
      experience of the way in which international agencies such  as  UNICEF
      operated.  While he could not entirely rule out the possibility that a
      junior UNICEF official helped the appellant on a  personal  basis  and
      without reference to normal UNICEF  practice,  the  Adjudicator  found
      this highly unlikely.

4.    Moving from there the Adjudicator in paragraph 25 stated  that  UNICEF
      as an international organisation would never  give  protection  for  a
      national for more than a  few  hours  without  contacting  other  more
      appropriate organisations, particularly the UNHCR or  the  Red  Cross.
      The  Adjudicator  found  the  appellant  to  be  wholly   lacking   in
      credibility and on the basis that he had fabricated  his  claim  there
      was no need to consider the background evidence.

5.    In the grounds of appeal it  is  accepted  that  the  Adjudicator  had
      stated at the hearing that UNICEF "just don't behave like  that".   It
      is perhaps unfortunate that the Adjudicator apparently  used  language
      of that kind because it would indicate to any impartial observer  that
      he had formed a view about the evidence before him.   It is  extremely
      important  that  the  impression  of  bias  is  not   given   to   the
      representatives or to the witnesses at a hearing.

6.    Miss Storey  has  drawn  our  attention  in  the  bundle  to  material
      indicating  that  the  international  organisations  have  not  always
      behaved in the manner that one would expect and hope.   In  this  case
      nothing adverse is claimed by the appellant vis-a-viz the  conduct  of
      the locally engaged employee.  He simply befriended him for a week. We
      do feel in all the circumstances that the Adjudicator's  determination
      is not safe.  Mr Saville accepted that  the  Adjudicator  should  have
      done more to let the parties know the extent of his knowledge and give
      a proper opportunity to rebut the points on which  he  relied  and  he
      does not as we understand it strenuously resist the suggestion by Miss
      Storey that the  case  should  be  heard  afresh.    Having  carefully
      considered the matter we have come to the conclusion that remittal for
      a fresh hearing before a  different  Adjudicator  is  the  appropriate
      outcome in this case.

7.    The appeal is allowed to the extent indicated.
