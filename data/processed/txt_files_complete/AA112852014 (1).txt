                            REMITTAL AND REASONS

1.    This appeal is not subject to an anonymity order by the First-tier
    Tribunal. I have not been asked to make one and see no public policy
    reason for doing so and none is made.


Background

2.    The appellant is a citizen of Afghanistan born on 01 January 1997.  He
    arrived in the UK in or  about  June  2011  and  claimed  asylum.  That
    application was refused but, as  the  appellant  was  a  minor  he  was
    granted Discretionary Leave to Remain in the UK until he reached  17  ï¿½
    years of age.  On 30th June 2014  the  appellant  applied  for  further
    leave to remain and that application was refused 01 December 2014.

3.    The appellant appealed to the  First-tier  Tribunal.  The  appeal  was
    heard by Judge Geraint Jones  QC  on  19  March  2015.  In  a  decision
    promulgated on 23 March 2015, Judge  Jones  dismissed  the  appellant's
    appeal on asylum, humanitarian protection  and  human  rights  grounds.
    Judge  Jones  refused  the  appellant's  renewed  application  for   an
    adjournment pending an assessment of the appellant by the local  mental
    health team and receipt of an expert's report, which  at  the  date  of
    hearing was only available in draft form. The judge went on to make  an
    adverse credibility finding and rejected the appellant's claim.

4.    The appellant sought permission  to  appeal  challenging  the  judge's
    refusal to adjourn the appeal and the adverse credibility finding.

5.    On 17 April 2015, the First-tier Tribunal  (Judge  Nicholson)  granted
    the appellant permission to appeal.

6.    Thus, the appeal came before me.

7.     At  the  outset  of  the  hearing,  Mr  Tufan,  who  represented  the
    respondent, maintained the position adopted in the respondent's Rule 24
    reply and accepted that the judge's decision could not  stand.  It  was
    thus accepted that the judge had materially erred in law. In  light  of
    the respondent's concession, I announced at  the  hearing  that  I  was
    satisfied that the judge's decision contained material  errors  of  law
    for the reasons given in the grant of permission.  Essentially  it  was
    accepted that  shortly  before  the  hearing  the  appellant  had  been
    referred to a  mental  health  team  for  assessment.  The  appellant's
    representatives sought an adjournment  of  the  appeal  to  enable  the
    appellant to produce expert medical evidence and  a  finalised  country
    expert report, which at the date of hearing existed only in draft form.
    Whilst the judge gave detailed reasons  for  refusing  to  adjourn  the
    appeal, there was medical evidence indicating that  the  appellant  may
    have mental  health  problems.  He  was  thus  arguably  classed  as  a
    vulnerable adult for the purposes of the  Joint  Presidential  Guidance
    Note No. 2 of 2010. The appellant's  representatives  provided  reasons
    for the delay in obtaining the medical evidence, given the need  for  a
    mental health  referral;  and  the  adjournment  requested  was  for  a
    relatively short period. Given that the state of the appellant's mental
    health was relevant to the  assessment  of  credibility,  it  was  thus
    accepted that the judge ought to have adjourned in those  circumstances
    and not to do so was arguably unfair.


Decision and Disposal

8.    On that basis, and in light of the respondent's  concession  that  the
    judge's decision contained material errors of law and cannot  stand,  I
    set aside that decision and remit the appeal for a  de  novo  rehearing
    before the First-tier Tribunal to be heard by a judge other than  Judge
    G Jones QC.
