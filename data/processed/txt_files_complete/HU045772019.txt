                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Franczak, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr Bates, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                     REASONS FOR FINDING AN ERROR OF LAW

1.   The appellant is a citizen of the People's Republic of  China  born  on
    5th March 1982.  He made application for leave to remain in the  United
    Kingdom on 3rd September 2018 and that application was refused  by  the
    respondent on 22nd February 2019.

2.   The appellant's immigration history is as follows. He  claims  to  have
    arrived in the United Kingdom on 27th October 2014  and  on  that  date
    claimed that he was at risk in China as a  practising  Christian.   His
    application  was  refused  on  3rd  November  2004  and  the  appellant
    appealed.  His appeal was dismissed in a determination  promulgated  on
    11th January 2005.  He made further submissions unsuccessfully in April
    2012 and May 2012.  On 12th May 2012 the appellant  had  a  child  with
    [DC], a woman who at that time had indefinite leave to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom.

3.   Further submissions were made, as a result of which the  appellant  was
    granted leave to remain outside the Immigration Rules on 4th March 2016
    until 4th September 2018.  It  was  on  3rd  September  2018  that  the
    appellant  made  his  application  which  was  the   subject   of   the
    respondent's refusal on 22nd February 2019.

4.   As a result of that refusal the appellant appealed  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and his appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Evans in
    Manchester on 10th May 2019.

5.   Before me both representatives  agreed  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge had made an error of law and that  his  determination  could  not
    stand.  He failed properly to consider Section 55 and the  best  rights
    of the appellant's child.

6.   As a result, I set aside the determination  save  for  the  finding  at
    paragraph 61 of the determination, which will stand.  The  appeal  will
    be reheard by the First-tier Tribunal by a judge other than  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Evans given that  the  appellant  has  effectively  been
    denied a fair hearing.  A Mandarin interpreter  is  required,  and  two
    hours should be set aside for the hearing of the appeal.
