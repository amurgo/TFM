Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr C Manna, Counsel, instructed by Abbott Solicitors

For the Respondent:    Mr P Nath, Home Office Presenting Officer
                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by a citizen of Pakistan against the decision of  the
    First-tier Tribunal dismissing his appeal against the decision  of  the
    respondent to  refuse  to  give  him  leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur) Migrant under the points-based system.  There  was  only
    one substantial point taken against him and it  was  that  he  had  not
    produced the required evidence in the required form about his access to
    capital.

 2. The First-tier Tribunal decided that the  document  relied  on  by  the
    appellant did not satisfy the requirements of the Rules and  consistent
    with that finding did not trouble to decide if the  document  had  ever
    been produced.  The difficulty is that I cannot understand the  finding
    that the document produced "does not satisfy any  of  the  requirements
    listed" at Appendix C1(B) of HC 395.

 3. Mr Manna went through that Rule with me while we looked at the document
    and it seems absolutely plain that it does satisfy the requirements  of
    the Rules. I cannot make sense of the finding to the contrary.  Mr Nath
    agreed that the document appeared to satisfy the  requirements  of  the
    Rules and I find that it plainly does. It  follows  that  the  disputed
    document, if it had been provided at the right  time,  would  certainly
    have made a difference to the outcome of the appeal and therefore it is
    a material error on the part of the judge not to  have  decided  if  in
    fact it was sent with the application as the appellant  claims,  or  on
    some later occasion as could conceivably be the case.

 4.  I  rehearse  here  the  arguments  for  it  being  produced  with  the
    application.  It is, I find, clear that the appellant asserted when  he
    made his application that an appropriate bank statement accompanied the
    application form. That is not evidence that he did.  It is  conceivable
    that the appellant was being dishonest.  It is conceivable that he made
    an honest mistake and thought that he had sent something  that  he  had
    not sent.

 5. What is absolutely plain is that on  the  application  form  where  the
    appellant was required to identify  documents  that  score  him  points
    under "Section 7 (Maintenance)" he  said  that  one  of  the  documents
    provided was a bank statement and a similar consistent claim  was  made
    also under Section 7 where under a list  of  items  provided  there  is
    reference to a "bank letter" and also a "bank statement".

 6. I find it deeply regrettable that the Secretary of State did not give a
    clearer reason for refusing the application.  I look at the  notice  of
    refusal such as it is and I read under the part of the form devoted  to
    Appendix C:

         "You have not provided any of  the  acceptable  evidence  specified
         under paragraph 1B of  Appendix  C  of  the  Immigration  Rules  to
         demonstrate that you have been in possession of at  least  ï¿½900  of
         available funds for a consecutive 90 day period ending no more than
         31 days before the date of your application in order  to  meet  the
         maintenance requirements."

 7. I do not know if the Secretary of State means that no evidence  at  all
    was provided on the point or if the Secretary of State means  that  the
    evidence that was provided was deficient in some way because it did not
    meet all of the requirements of the Rules. This, I think, is a standard
    paragraph.  Certainly I recall seeing it before and it really would  be
    very helpful if the Secretary of State would think carefully about  not
    using standard paragraphs that are ambiguous. It would be better to say
    what she meant, even if making the position clear took a little longer.

 8. It is also a matter of surprise to me that the Secretary of  State  did
    not seem to do anything when presented with an application form  saying
    that  the  bank  statement  was  provided  before  concluding  that  no
    acceptable evidence was provided.  It would have been at least wise  to
    have said that the application form referred to a  bank  statement  but
    that no bank statement was  provided,  if  such  be  the  case,  or  do
    something else in the decision to show that the form had been read  and
    the deficiencies made known.

 9. I think it is particularly important in the  age  of  the  points-based
    system  where  the  appeal  system  does  not  generally   provide   an
    opportunity to remedy deficiencies in the evidence  that  it  is  clear
    beyond all argument what actual evidence was before  the  Secretary  of
    State.  Whilst no doubt applicants could keep meticulous copies or have
    the contents of the posted bundle witnessed by a  reliable  independent
    party or something of the sort, I think that is a counsel of perfection
    that is inappropriate in a system which ought to be intelligible by  an
    informed and interested user.

10. It follows that the evidence before me suggests  that  a  document  was
    sent and this point is not really countered by the ambiguous  words  in
    the refusal notice which leave me uncertain about what exactly is  said
    to have been wrong.

11. Mr Manna has invited me to allow the appeal  outright.  He  says,  with
    some justification, that if  I  am  persuaded  that  the  document  was
    probably sent there is really nothing else to discuss.  Mr Nath for the
    Secretary of State says that the document has never been checked by the
    Secretary of State and Mr Manna's riposte is that is the fault  of  the
    Secretary of State.  Certainly it  has  been  available  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal since September and it is the appellant's  case  it  was  made
    available in the First-tier Tribunal.  It ought to have been dealt with
    before now.

12. However it has not been considered and giving the Secretary of State  a
    short period of time when she can make further remedies if  she  is  so
    minded will not really cause any great inconvenience to the  appellant.
    I have already indicated that I do not think there will be any need for
    a further hearing unless the Secretary of  State  comes  up  with  some
    credible and sensible objection to the documents produced.

13. I therefore direct that the Secretary of State produces any comment  or
    submission on the documents from the appellant no later than 4.0 pm  on
    16 October 2014 and after that time, at a time convenient to me, but  I
    hope very soon after it, I will look at the file and  either  determine
    the appeal finally or give further directions.

14. I record here that I said to Mr Nath that although it is  open  to  the
    Secretary of State to apply for more time I do not expect to give  more
    time  unless  quite  exceptional  and  compelling  circumstances   were
    advanced.  I also made it plain that I had no intention of giving these
    directions in writing.  They were made orally in the hearing  room  and
    were noted carefully by  Mr  Nath.  If  they  are  not  heeded  by  the
    Secretary of State I will assume she has no interest in doing anything.

15. I returned to the file  on  22  October  2014.  There  was  nothing  to
    indicate that the Secretary of State had sent in further  material.  My
    clerk contacted the Secretary of State who confirmed that  nothing  had
    been sent. I see no point in waiting any longer.

16. In the absence of any contrary evidence I find  it  at  least  probable
    that the appellant sent then document that he has long claimed to  have
    sent and that his application satisfies the rules.

17. The First-tier Tribunal erred by deciding perversely  that  a  disputed
    document did not satisfy the requirements  of  the  rules  and  further
    erred by failing to decide  if  the  document  was  produced  with  the
    application.

18. I resolve both issues in  the  appellant's  favour.  I  set  aside  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal and I allow the appeal.
