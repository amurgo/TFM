For the Appellant:           No appearance
For the Respondent:          Mr Corden, Home Office Presenting Officer

The definition of "an external student" in para 6 of the Immigration Rules
makes it clear that, to comply with para 57(iv), an external student must
be registered as studying for a degree from a UK degree awarding body.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant, a national of India, appealed to  the  Tribunal  against
    the decision of the Respondent Entry Clearance  Officer  on  8  October
    2007 refusing him entry clearance to the United Kingdom as  a  student.
    The Immigration Judge dismissed the appeal.  The Appellant  sought  and
    obtained an order for reconsideration.  Thus the  matter  comes  before
    us.

 2. The Appellant is, of course outside the  United  Kingdom.   He  has  no
    representative in the United Kingdom.  There was no appearance  by  him
    or on his behalf before us.  We decided that this  was  an  appropriate
    case to decide in his absence.

 3. The Appellant's  proposal  was  to  undertake  an  MBA,  receiving  his
    teaching at CESOS London College, with a view to a  degree  awarded  by
    IMPAC University in the United States.

 4. The Entry Clearance Officer refused the  application  on  a  number  of
    grounds.  He was not satisfied that the Appellant  intended  to  follow
    the chosen course or that his plan to study was realistic  or  in  line
    with his previous pattern of study.  He  was  not  satisfied  that  the
    Appellant was seeking a degree awarded by a UK  degree  awarding  body.
    He further was not satisfied that the Appellant had  available  to  him
    sufficient funds to meet the cost of his studies and accommodation.

 5. The Immigration Judge  concluded  that  he  was  satisfied  on  matters
    relating  to  the  Appellant's  intention.   He  calculated  the  funds
    available to the Appellant and concluded that at  ï¿½458  they  were  not
    sufficient.  He also said that "the  fact  the  Appellant  is  doing  a
    degree course which is not awarded by a UK degree  awarding  body  must
    mean that the Appellant fails to meet one of the other requirements  of
    para 57".  He thus dismissed the appeal.

 6. The application  for  reconsideration  contains  detailed  calculations
    relating to the funds said to be available to the Appellant.  It  makes
    no mention of  the  other  ground  upon  which  the  Immigration  Judge
    dismissed  the  appeal.   The   order   for   reconsideration,   rather
    surprisingly, refers only to that other ground  and  does  not  mention
    funding.  It looks as though the Senior Immigration Judge was so  taken
    with the point that he had thought of himself that the forgot  to  deal
    with the point raised by the Appellant.

 7. We will deal  first  with  the  question  of  whether  the  Appellant's
    proposal could meet the requirements of the rules in  any  event.   The
    relevant rules are those in para 57 of  the  Statement  of  Changes  in
    Immigration Rules, HC395, as follows:


        "The requirements to be met by a person seeking leave to enter  the
        United Kingdom as a student are that he:


           (i)   has been accepted for a course of study, or  a  period  of
              research, which is to be provided  by  or  undertaken  at  an
              organisation which is included on the register  of  Education
              and Training Providers, and is at either:


                 (a)   a publicly funded institution of further  or  higher
              education which maintains satisfactory records  of  enrolment
              and attendance of students and supplies these to  the  Border
              and Immigration agency when requested; or


                 (b)   a bona fide private education institution; or


                  (c)    an  independent  fee  paying  school  outside  the
              maintained sector which  maintains  satisfactory  records  of
              enrolment and attendance of students and  supplies  these  to
              the Border and Immigration Agency when requested; and


           (ii)  is able and intends to follow either:


              a) a recognised  full-time  degree  course  or  post  graduate
                 studies at a publicly  funded  institution  of  further  or
                 higher education; or


              b) a period of study and or research in excess of  six  months
                 at a publicly funded institution or higher education  where
                 this forms part of an overseas degree course, or


              c) a weekday full-time course involving attendance at a single
                 institution for a minimum of 15  hours'  organised  daytime
                 study per week of a  single  subject  or  directly  related
                 subjects; or


              d) a full-time course of study at an  independent  fee  paying
                 school; and...


            (iv) if he has been accepted to study externally for a degree at
              a private institution, he is also registered as  an  external
              student with the UK degree awarding body ...."




 8. The Appellant's proposal was to attend a private college for  a  course
    which led to a degree awarded by a degree awarding body which is not  a
    UK degree awarding body. The Immigration Judge appears  to  have  taken
    the view that under those circumstances the Appellant  could  not  meet
    the requirements of subparagraph (iv), because he is not registered  as
    an external student with any UK degree awarding body.

 9. Mr Corden said that the terms of subparagraph (iv) were  very  unclear.
    He asked us to read it as though the word "the" were replaced with "a".
     If the subparagraph were amended in that way, it would be  clear  that
    any student seeking to prepare himself for  a  degree  other  than  one
    awarded by the institution at which he was studying (for that  is  what
    an external degree is) would need to be registered for a degree with  a
    UK degree awarding body.

10. Although that alteration would bring clarity to the subparagraph, it is
    not easy to see that the clear meaning that would ensue is the  meaning
    intended.  There is no doubt that the reference to a  "recognised  full
    time degree course" in subparagraph (ii)(a) means a degree awarded by a
    recognised UK institution: YS and  SJ  [2006]  UKAIT  00094.   But  the
    Appellant, like many thousands of overseas students, does  not  propose
    to study  at  a  publicly  funded  institution  of  further  or  higher
    education.  He proposes to study at a private college.  If the proposed
    modification and reading of subparagraph (iv) is correct, it would have
    the effect that a  course  of  studies  at  such  a  college  would  be
    permissible if undertaken by reference to a prospect of  a  UK  degree,
    and equally permissible if undertaken without reference to any prospect
    of a degree, but impermissible if undertaken with reference to a degree
    awarded by a body outside the United Kingdom. We can see no conceivable
    policy for a rule in that form, and  so  would  hesitate  to  adopt  Mr
    Corden's suggestion.

11. If, however, the rule is read as it stands, the reference has to be  to
    the UK degree awarding body that is part of the  applicant's  proposal.
    If that is right then "degree" in the first phrase of the  subparagraph
    means a UK degree, which is perhaps what one would expect in any event;
    and the whole subparagraph only applies to  a  person  who  intends  to
    study for a UK degree at an institution other than  that  which  awards
    the degree.  The requirement itself then becomes entirely intelligible:
    the student must show not merely he has been accepted for  the  course,
    but also that  he  is  registered  for  the  degree.   Those  concepts,
    normally combined in the case  of  a  course  undertaken  at  a  degree
    awarding institution, are separate in the  case  of  external  studies.
    The emphasis of  subparagraph  (iv)  then  shifts  from  an  additional
    requirement of registration with a UK awarding body to  emphasis  on  a
    requirement of registration with any UK degree awarding  body  involved
    in the application.

12. That interpretation of the actual words of the rule would  be  entirely
    coherent.  We recognise, that so interpreted, the rule allows study  at
    a private institution in this  country  for  a  degree  awarded  by  an
    overseas institution.  That is not particularly surprising, even in the
    light of the decision of the Tribunal in YS and SJ, because  that  case
    was about a different requirement, that a course be at "degree  level."
    It  is  not  surprising,  because  students  who  otherwise  meet   the
    requirements of the rules are allowed to come to this country in  order
    to undertake courses that do not lead to a UK degree and  it  would  be
    odd if it was more difficult for the same student to undertake the same
    course, if it led to a degree from an institution  outside  the  United
    Kingdom.

13. We therefore indicated at the hearing that we would hold that paragraph
    57(iv) did not apply to the Appellant as he was not undertaking studies
    leading to a degree awarded externally by a UK degree awarding body.

14. In preparing this written determination, however, we have become  aware
    of the terms of a paragraph of the Immigration Rules to which Mr Corden
    did not refer us.  There is in para 6, a definition reading as follows:
    -

         "an external student" is a student studying for a degree from a  UK
         degree awarding body without  any  requirement  to  attend  the  UK
         degree awarding body's premises or a UK Listed Body's premises  for
         lectures and tutorials."


15. So far as we can see, the phrase defined, "an external student", occurs
    only in para 57(iv).  In any event there can be little doubt  that  the
    definition is intended to have application to  that  subparagraph.   If
    the definition is inserted in place of the phrase defined, para  57(iv)
    imposes the requirement that:

         "if he has been accepted to study externally  for  a  degree  at  a
         private institution, he is also registered as an  external  student
         with the UK degree awarding body... "

    This makes it clear that a person who intends to  study  at  a  private
    education institution for a degree awarded by another body can meet the
    requirements of the rules only if registered as a  student  with  a  UK
    degree awarding body.  We do not know the purpose of that  requirement,
    which has the consequences set out in  para  10  above.   We  are  not,
    however, able to read para 57(iv) in any other way given the definition
    in paragraph 6.  It follows that the Immigration Judge was  correct  in
    his briefly expressed conclusion on the nature of the course.

16.    We  turn  now  to  funds.   As  we  have  said,   the   grounds   for
    reconsideration make detailed submissions of the amounts of funds.  The
    Immigration Judge excluded two proposed sources of funds,  for  reasons
    given as follows:

        "12.     I have noted copies of receipts of deposits made  in  2005
             to three multi benefits deposits scheme accounts held  at  the
             Punjab Bank.  However I  have  no  evidence  of  the  date  of
             maturity of these deposits and whether the funds have not been
             withdrawn  and  are  still  available.   I  am  therefore  not
             satisfied  that  the  funds  as  shown  in  the  receipts  are
             available for the Appellant's studies.


        13.      Similarly I have noted that the term deposit account  held
             at Oriental Bank of Commerce, but I noted that the monies held
             on deposit are not due for maturity until 23  September  2009.
             I am therefore not prepared to accept that the funds  held  in
             these accounts are available for the Appellant at the date  of
             the decision and would be available for his studies."

17.   The grounds for reconsideration assert that the person in question is
    the Appellant's uncle and would be prepared to support him.  They  also
    assert that the money in the other two accounts could be drawn  out  at
    short notice.  The problem is, however,  that  merely  showing  that  a
    family has funds available to it does not of itself show that  all  the
    family's funds are available for expenditure  on  one  family  member's
    education.  Further, when funds are invested in term deposits, although
    it may well be right that the capital can be withdrawn, that of  itself
    does not show that  it  will  be  withdrawn.   In  any  event,  as  the
    Immigration Judge noted, had had no evidence relating to the  ownership
    of some of the money, or to the proposals for the term deposit.  In the
    circumstances it appears to us that he was amply entitled to  make  the
    findings that he did.  He made no error of law in concluding  that  the
    funds shown to  be  genuinely  available  to  the  Appellant  were  not
    sufficient for his adequate maintenance and  accommodation  during  his
    studies.

18.   We considered whether to invite further argument  on  this  appeal  in
    the light of the conclusion drawn from para 6 of the Rules,  which  was
    not cited before us.  It is clear, however, that no injustice is caused
    to either party by our issuing this  determination  without  more  ado.
    The appellant's appeal was, as we have said,  correctly  dismissed  for
    another reason altogether; and the decision we reach on para 57(iv)  is
    that sought in any event by the Respondent and is on an issue on  which
    the appellant, served with  the  Order  for  Reconsideration,  made  no
    submissions.

19.   The Immigration Judge made no material error of law and we order  that
    his determination dismissing this appeal shall stand.
