The appellant in person
Miss A Holmes for the respondent

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   This is an appeal by a citizen of Ethiopia against the  decision  of  an
   adjudicator, Miss S I Bayne, sitting at Epsom, on 3 January,  dismissing
   her appeal against refusal of leave to enter. The sole  issue  on  which
   leave to appeal was granted on human rights grounds only related to  the
   appellant's medical condition.   The  adjudicator  dealt  with  that  as
   follows:

   39. I have carefully considered the medical evidence in this case  in  so
       far as her claim under Articles 3 and 8 of the  ECHR  are  concerned.
       It is clear that the appellant's sustained injury to her  eye  on  12
       July 2002 she was extremely vague as to how this injury was sustained
       but it has nevertheless resulted in the need for a Cornea graft which
       requires on-going treatment and close monitoring.   I take account of
       the view of Mr Duguid that the appellant should  not  be  repatriated
       until she had been monitored for a 6 month period.


   40. I have considered the objective evidence with regard to  the  medical
       service in Ethiopia and I have taken into account the letter from the
       Ethiopian Health Support Association.   The nature of this particular
       association was not explained to me but in  any  event,  I  find  the
       contents of this letter do little more than substantiate the contents
       to the objective evidence.  It is clear that  medical  facilities  in
       Ethiopia are limited and it is clear that  it  is  difficult  to  get
       proper treatment for many medical conditions.   However,  no  reasons
       were given for the confusion of the EHSA but treatment is  especially
       poor in the case of eye problems and I give  little  weight  to  this
       particular assertion.


   41. I received no evidence to satisfy me to the requisite  standard  that
       the  appellant's  medical  problems  are  of   such   severity   that
       repatriation to Ethiopia would result in treatment such as to  amount
       to an infringement of her rights under Article 3 of the ECHR.   There
       is no evidence that she is likely to loose her eyesight.  In fact the
       initial operation upon her eye was successful and although  treatment
       is poorer in Ethiopia than in the UK there is  no  evidence  to  show
       that it is impossible to get treatment and as result her claim  under
       Article 3 of the ECHR fails.

   42. For the same reasons I find  that  there  is  no  real  risk  of  the
       appellant's right to physical and moral integrity under Article 8  of
       the ECHR being breached.   In any event, the decision  to  refuse  to
       grant leave to the appellant was made in the  course  of  the  lawful
       implementation of the United Kingdom Immigration Control and in these
       circumstances is not disproportionate.

3. The appellant is not represented by solicitors, as those who were acting
   for her have told us  that  controlled  legal  representation  has  been
   withdrawn.   However, her friend Mr Redi Jemal has appeared with her  in
   Court, he is an Amharic speaker and has skilfully translated  everything
   that was said (which we made sure was made as simple as  possible),  and
   we were satisfied that she understood everything. The appellant's former
   solicitors did however do their job and as directed provided us with  an
   up to date report by a  consultant  ophthalmic  surgeon.   That  reports
   says:

      The appellant first presented to the Western Eye Hospital on 12  July
       2002 with a history of traumatic injury to the  left  eye  apparently
       sustained while performing some DIY tasks.  She was noted to  have  a
       full fitness corneal laceration on the right with  evidence  of  Iris
       prolapse through the wound.   We paused to note that the  injury  was
       to the appellant's right eye and not  her  left.    She  had  primary
       wound repair performed on the same day.   Her vision only improved to
       1/60 Snellen  in  the  ensuing  few  weeks  and  she  required  right
       pupilloplasty  performed under general anaesthetic on 24 October 2002
       after which her acuity improved to 6/36 Snellen.


          Despite this efforts and despite the efforts of  the  therapeutic
       contact lens she was noted to still have a  slight  leak  of  aqueous
       fluid through her wound  on  22  November  23002  and  she  underwent
       reparative full-thickness corneal graft on 4 December 2002, performed
       under general anaesthetic.   She requires re-suturing after the graft
       on 17 November 2002.  Since this time she has achieved a best  vision
       of 1/6 improving to 6/36 Snellen through a pinhole.   This is  likely
       due to an irregular astigmatism induced by her initial injury and the
       subsequent grafting.


        She has no evidence of any retinal pathology at present, and her eye
       is now stabilizing.  She continues to use anti-glaucomatous and anti-
       inflammatory medication, once daily in the right eye, and she is  due
       to be seen in early December 2003 in the eye  clinic.   In  terms  of
       improving her visual acuity in the future, she  would,  at  the  very
       least, require a rigid gas permeable contact lens to be fitted,  and,
       indeed, may require further surgery in order to improve  the  vision.
       It is unlikely that her vision in the right eye will ever be as  good
       as the left in the future.

4. What the appellant has told us is that she has some pain when she sleeps
   on the right side.  She also suffers from weeping when she goes  out  in
   bright sunshine.   She told us that she does have a pair  of  sunglasses
   although it was a bright winter's morning  when  we  sat,  she  was  not
   wearing them on the day of our hearing.  She has told  us  however  that
   she feels "strain and pain" when concentrating  and  has  difficulty  in
   reading.

5. The position shown by Mr Maini's report as we summarised it  to  her  is
   that her condition has settled down.   She still has only limited vision
   in her right eye, and, to get any improvement, further  surgery  may  be
   required including at least inserting a rigid contact  lens.   She  does
   however have what is called a therapeutic contact lens and  her  eye  is
   being treated with  ointment.   The  appellant  complains  that  skilled
   medical treatment would not be available in Ethiopia.  As Ms Holmes  has
   pointed out, there does not seem to be any reason why what is being done
   for the appellant at the moment should not still be  available  to  her.
   She would still have her contact  lens,  and  could  take  a  supply  of
   ointment when she returned; and there is no evidence that that  sort  of
   medication would not be available in Ethiopia.

6. We do accept that specialist care, by way of a  rigid  contact  lens  or
   further surgery, is not likely to be readily available in Ethiopia.   It
   follows that the position which will face the  appellant  on  return  to
   Ethiopia is this: she will have limited vision in her right eye,  though
   no problems with her left one.   Her condition  will  unfortunately  not
   get any better; but, on the other hand, there is no reason in  our  view
   why it should get significantly worse.

7. We have to consider whether sending her back to this  state  of  affairs
   would be a breach of the appellant's human  rights.  Article  3  of  the
   Human Rights Convention says  that  people  should  not  be  exposed  to
   "inhuman or degrading treatment".   Bearing in mind the minimum level of
   severity which has been required in cases  that  have  come  before  the
   Courts here and in Europe, we have no doubt that this  appellant's  case
   does not pass that high test.

8. Whether the effect of losing the chance to improve  her  eyesight  would
   amount to a breach of her physical  and  moral  integrity,  contrary  to
   article 8 of the Human Rights Convention, or not  is  not  something  we
   need to give a definite view on.   That is because we think that,  since
   she can see perfectly well out of her left eye and live her  daily  life
   in that way, the fact that she has limited vision in he right  eye,  and
   some discomfort, could not amount to an interference  with  her  private
   life which would outweigh what Simon Brown LJ  called  in  Djali  [2003]
   EWCA Civ 1371 "the imperative and overriding  interests  of  immigration
   control".  We have a great deal of sympathy with  this  appellant;  but,
   for the reasons we have given, her appeal must be dismissed.

                                                                  (chairman)
