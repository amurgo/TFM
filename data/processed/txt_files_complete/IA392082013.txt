                               R C T FEVRIERE
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:     Mr H Ndubuisi, of Drummond Miller, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Presenting Officer

                            NOTICE of ABANDONMENT

 1. The appellant is a citizen of St Lucia, born on 14  January  1996.   Mr
    Ndubuisi advised us, and Mrs O'Brien confirmed, that on a  date  before
    the end of September  the  respondent  granted  him  leave  to  remain.
    Unfortunately Mr Ndubuisi had realised only yesterday that  this  might
    impact on these proceedings.

 2. In terms of the 2002 Act section 104(4A) these proceedings are  treated
    as abandoned, as from when  leave  was  granted.   The  Upper  Tribunal
    should have been advised  immediately.    The  hearing  before  us  was
    unnecessary.
