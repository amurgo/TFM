For the Appellant:     Ms Jones, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Dr Nwakuna (Sponsor)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Respondent OCN is a national of Nigeria born in 1995.    She  seeks
    leave to enter the United Kingdom as the partner  of  her  husband  and
    sponsor Dr Ugonna Sampson Nwakuna.

 2. Leave to enter was refused by the Entry Clearance Officer (ECO) on  the
    10th September 2018 and the Appellant exercised a right of appeal.  The
    appeal was allowed  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Juss  on  the  9th
    September 2019.  The Entry Clearance Officer now appeals  against  that
    decision, with permission to do so granted on the 16th December 2019 by
    First-tier Tribunal Grant-Hutchinson.




    A Right of Appeal?

 3. The first question raised in this  appeal  is  whether  the  First-tier
    Tribunal had jurisdiction to hear the case at all.

 4. Under s82(1) Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  there  are
    only three rights  of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal:

         Right of appeal to the Tribunal

         (1)      A person ("P") may appeal to the Tribunal where-

             (a) the Secretary of State has decided to refuse a  protection
             claim made by P,

             (b) the Secretary of State  has  decided  to  refuse  a  human
             rights claim made by P, or

             (c)  the  Secretary  of  State  has  decided  to  revoke   P's
             protection status.

 5. Mrs Nwakuna had never asserted a right of appeal under  s82(1)  (a)  or
    (c).   The only conceivable avenue  of  appeal  applicable  to  a  wife
    seeking to join her husband was provided  by  s82(1)(b).  In  order  to
    pursue it she would have to plead, under s84(2), that the decision  was
    unlawful under section 6 of the  Human  Rights  Act  1998.     In  this
    onward appeal the ECO  asserts  that  Mrs  Nwakuna  had  made  no  such
    assertion, and that as she was seeking  to  join  her  Tier  2  Migrant
    husband, this had actually been an application made under  the  'Points
    Based System'.

 6. The statutory scheme gives rise to three questions:

          i) Did Mrs Nwakuna make a human rights claim?

         ii) Was it refused?

        iii) Did she assert, in her grounds of appeal,  that  the  decision
             was an unlawful interference with her human rights?

 7. The answer to the first question is, in my view, yes.  On the 11th July
    2018 Mrs Nwakuna made an online application for entry  clearance.    At
    the top that form indicates that the type of visa she was applying  for
    is 'settlement', and that this too was the purpose of the  application.
    An application to settle with your spouse is, it is  common  ground,  a
    human rights  application.   The  fact  that  Dr  Nwakuna  subsequently
    indicated that his wife had intended to apply for a visa as  a  Tier  2
    dependent, and had filled in that form in error, does  not  change  the
    fact  that  the  application  lodged  was  in  fact  a   human   rights
    application: Sheidu (Further submissions; appealable  decision)  [2016]
    UKUT 000412 (IAC) by anaology.

 8. That this is so is reflected by the  ECO's  decision,  dated  the  10th
    September 2018. The ECO wrote to  Mrs  Nwakuna  a  letter  prefaced  as
    follows:

         "Your human rights claim in an application for entry clearance made
         on the 11th July 2018 has been refused. ...  you  can  appeal  this
         decision".

    The answer to the second question is therefore uncontrovertibly yes.

 9. That being the case, it is quite clear that the statutory  requirements
    in s82(1)(b) are met. There was a right of  appeal  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

10. It is the final question which has, it would seem, given  rise  to  the
    confusion. In its decision the First-tier Tribunal records that Article
    8 was not raised before it; it is this comment that the ECO has  relied
    upon in submitting that there was never a  human  rights  appeal  here.
    Both the First-tier Tribunal and the ECO are wrong. Whilst the  grounds
    of appeal do refer to the rules relating to Tier 2 dependent  migrants,
    they also contain the clear assertion that  the  decision  is  unlawful
    under s6 of the Human Rights Act 1998:

         "The refusal of leave to enter is  breach  of  my  human  right  to
         private and family life"

    Furthermore the First-tier Tribunal recognises  that  this  ground  was
    unaltered before it, noting [at �8] that Dr Nwakuna asserted  a  'human
    right' to have his wife here with him.

11. It follows that the answer to all three of the questions posed  by  the
    statutory framework, set out at my �6 above, are  in  the  affirmative.
    There was a human rights claim, that was  refused,  and  the  appellant
    asserted human rights as a ground of appeal under s84.  The  First-tier
    Tribunal had jurisdiction to hear the appeal. The  ECO's  assertion  to
    the contrary is rejected.




    Misdirection

12. This leads me to the second ground of appeal.  That  is  that  the  ECO
    takes issue with the First-tier Tribunal's formulation that the  appeal
    is allowed "under the Rules".   I have already set out the  basis  upon
    which Mrs Nwakuna had brought her case before the First-tier  Tribunal.
    There was no case 'under the rules' and certainly  no  jurisdiction  to
    allow an appeal  on  that  basis.  Had  the  First-tier  Tribunal  been
    referring to, for instance, the partner provisions under  Appendix  FM,
    such a form of words might  have  been  unfortunate,  but  permissible,
    since they could be construed to mean that Mrs Nwakuna had made out her
    Article 8 case with reference to those Rules, but it is far from  clear
    that this is what was meant.  In fact the  couple  accepted  that  they
    could not qualify under said rules because  Dr  Nwakuna  is  not  -  or
    rather was not at the date of the appeal  -  'settled'.  He  could  not
    therefore meet the requirements of Gen.1.2 of Appendix FM, and his wife
    was not therefore 'eligible' for settlement.  This ground is  therefore
    made out.




    Reasons

13. The ECO's final ground is that the determination is devoid of  reasons,
    and it is not possible for the ECO to understand why he has lost. It is
    with regret that I find this ground to be made  out.    The  First-tier
    Tribunal notes that the wrong application was filled in, and  that  the
    intended application was under Tier 2.  It then  records  Dr  Nwakuna's
    displeasure at having to travel back to Nigeria to see his wife all the
    time, before setting out the bare facts in respect of the marriage  and
    his employment in the United Kingdom. From there the decision  proceeds
    directly to the conclusion that the appeal is allowed.   I am unable to
    understand on what basis that conclusion was reached.  This  ground  is
    made out.




    Disposal

14. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is flawed for material error of
    law, both grounds (ii) and (iii) having been made out.

15. In light of my finding that Mrs Nwakuna does have a right of appeal, it
    therefore falls to me to remake her human rights  appeal.  The  parties
    before me are in agreement that the relevant date for the purpose of my
    assessment must be todays date.

16.  My  starting  point  is  to  assess  whether  Mrs  Nwakuna  meets  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules.  Since her application  was  for
    settlement as a spouse, I look first to Appendix FM.

17.  The  refusal  letter  dated  10th  September  2018  states  that   the
    application does not fall to be  refused  on  grounds  of  suitability.
    There  is  no  evidence  before  me  to  suggest  that  there  are  any
    suitability issues pertaining, and certainly Ms Jones did  not  suggest
    that there were. I am accordingly satisfied that Mrs Nwakuna meets  the
    suitability requirements.

18. In respect of the eligibility requirements the sole  reason  given  for
    refusing her a visa was that Dr Nwakuna was not  settled.   At  today's
    date Dr Nwakuna is settled  in  the  United  Kingdom.  He  was  granted
    indefinite leave to remain on the 13th January 2020.   At the  date  of
    the  decision  the  remaining  eligibility   requirements   were   met,
    specifically the ECO was satisfied that Dr Nwakuna  was  earning  above
    the minimum  income  threshold  set  out  in  E-ECP.3.1,  all  relevant
    documents, including a letter from his NHS Trust employer, having  been
    provided.  For the avoidance of doubt Dr Nwakuna has produced before me
    NHS payslips covering the past six months,  with  accompanying  Natwest
    Bank statements, demonstrating that he receives  a  monthly  salary  of
    between �3891.12 (October 2019) and �2996 (January  2020).  The  reason
    that the amount fluctuates is unclear but the total  annual  figure  is
    given of �48,075.  This is well in excess of the  �18,600  required  by
    the Rules. There has never been any issue taken with the assertion that
    this is a genuine and subsisting relationship  and  I  accept,  on  the
    basis of Dr Nwakuna's evidence, and the documentary evidence  provided,
    that it is: this includes the birth certificate of  his  son,  born  in
    Nigeria in October of last year.  Having considered all of the evidence
    before me I am satisfied that as of today's date Mrs Nwakuna meets  all
    of the requirements for leave to enter as a partner set out in Appendix
    FM.

19. I bear in mind that this is an Article 8 appeal. I  am  satisfied  that
    there is between the sponsor and Mrs Nwakuna a genuine  and  subsisting
    family life.   I am satisfied that in refusing her entry there has been
    an interference with, or lack of respect for,  that  family  life.  The
    question before me is whether the decision is proportionate. The  rules
    relating to spousal settlement are, in  the  context  of  Appendix  FM,
    specifically approved by parliament to strike a  fair  balance  between
    the rights of the individual and the rights of the state to control its
    own borders. Since Mrs Nwakuna meets the requirements of those rules it
    follows that the Secretary of State would hold it  disproportionate  to
    refuse leave. I therefore find that the decision is  unlawful  pursuant
    to s6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 and the appeal must be allowed.




    Decisions

20. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal is flawed for error of law
    and it is set aside.

21. I remake the decision in the appeal by allowing  the  appeal  on  human
    rights grounds.

22. There is no direction for anonymity.
