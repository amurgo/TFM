                   DEPUTY UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE CHAMBERLAIN

                                   Between

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                   Appellant

                                     and

                                     MAB
                         (anonymity direction MADE)
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr. R. Dunlop, Counsel instructed by the Government
                    Legal Department
For the Respondent:    Mr. S. Vokes, Counsel instructed by Wornham & Co
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The error of law decision in this appeal was promulgated  on  12  April
    2016.  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside.


 2. I have received submissions from MAB's representatives.  I  have  taken
    account of the Practice Statement dated  10  February  2010,  paragraph
    7.2.  This contemplates that an appeal may be remitted  to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal where the effect of the error has been to deprive a party
    before the First-tier Tribunal of a fair hearing or  other  opportunity
    for the party's case to be put to  and  considered  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  Given the nature and extent of the fact-finding necessary to
    enable this appeal to be remade, and having regard  to  the  overriding
    objective, I find that it is appropriate to  remit  this  case  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal.


 3. I note that MAB's representatives requested a three person panel.  This
    is a matter for the First-tier Tribunal and can be  raised  during  the
    case management procedure.

Decision

The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for rehearing.


Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.


Signed                                  Date 10 May 2016
