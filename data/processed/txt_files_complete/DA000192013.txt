Representation:

For the Appellant:     Miss A Radford (instructed by Braitch RB Solicitors)


For the Respondent:    Mr J Parkinson (Home Office Presenting Officer)

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. The Appellant, a citizen of Zimbabwe, appeals, with  permission,  to  the
   Upper Tribunal  against a decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal   (Judge
   Pooler and Mr Olszewski)  promulgated  on  2nd  July  2013  by  which  it
   dismissed his appeal against the Secretary of State's decision to  deport
   him to Zimbabwe.

2. There had been no application for anonymity in this case  and  I  see  no
   reason to order it.

3. The background to this  appeal  is  that  the  Appellant,  born  on  14th
   January 1971 and now aged 42 came to the UK on 6th  September  2002  with
   leave to enter as a student valid until 31st October 2003. He  overstayed
   that leave and in August 2005 after being  encountered  and  detained  by
   UKBA claimed asylum. He was released on  temporary  admission.  In  March
   2006 he applied for leave to remain as a highly skilled migrant. That was
   refused in May 2006. His asylum application was refused on the grounds of
   non-compliance in May 2007. However, on 23rd December 2010 the  Secretary
   of State granted him Indefinite Leave to Remain in the United Kingdom.
4. On 8th August 2011 the Appellant was convicted on his guilty plea  of  21
   offences relating to his "business" of selling counterfeit DVDs.  He  was
   sentenced to 20 months imprisonment. That sentence was then increased  by
   668 days on 18th October 2012 following a confiscation order hearing. The
   value of the counterfeit goods was said to be over ï¿½80,000 and twice that
   had they been genuine.

5. As a result of those convictions are Secretary of State made  a  decision
   on 20th December 2012 to deport him pursuant to section 32 (5) of the  UK
   Borders Act 2007. It was the Appellant's  appeal  against  that  decision
   which was before the First-tier Tribunal.

6. Permission to appeal was initially refused by a Judge of  the  First-tier
   Tribunal but then granted by Upper Tribunal  Judge Rintoul who  found  it
   arguable that the First-tier Tribunal  had erred in its  conclusion  that
   it is proportionate to expect the Appellant's  partner  to   relocate  to
   Zimbabwe.

7. It is my task first to decide whether the  First-tier  Tribunal  made  an
   error of law and if so whether  and  to  what  extent  its  determination
   should be set aside.

8. The grounds seeking permission to appeal, all of which were  relied  upon
   by Miss Radford are four; firstly when considering  risk  on  return  the
   Tribunal failed to  take  into  account  the  political  profile  of  the
   Appellant's family; secondly, failing to make a finding as to whether the
   Appellant's sur place activities  represented  genuinely  held  political
   beliefs; thirdly, finding  it  reasonable  for  the  Appellant's  British
   partner to leave the UK and fourthly, failing to consider the  impact  of
   her departure from the UK  on the Appellant 's son who  is  a  vulnerable
   adult and for whom she is the primary carer.

9. In relation to the first ground Miss  Radford  referred  to  the  Country
   Guidance cases that confirmed politically active  family  members  are  a
   risk factor and would lead to interrogation by the CIO  at  the  airport.
   She pointed out that in its findings as to risk on  return  the  Tribunal
   had concentrated on the Appellant's low level support but not factored in
   his family's situation.  His two sisters came to the UK in 2002 and  have
   been granted refugee status.  His mother who came to the UK in  2007  has
   also been granted refugee status.

10.  There  is  little  evidence  in  the  sisters'  and  mother's   witness
   statements or oral evidence as to their  political  activities.   Sheilla
   says that she is a committee member of Wolverhampton MDC.   Both  sisters
   refer to working for the MDC in Zimbabwe and being attacked by Zanu PF as
   a result of  which  they  fled.   Their  evidence  although  considerably
   lacking in detail, was unchallenged by the Home Office Presenting Officer
   before the First-tier Tribunal and as a result accepted by it. It is also
   the case that all three are refugees. I was not  told  of  the  basis  of
   their claims.

11. The Tribunal noted that the Appellant also came to  the  UK  in  2002  -
   with leave as a student.  He did not claim asylum  until  apprehended  by
   the authorities.  He had  not  been  of  any  interest  to  the  Zimbabwe
   authorities between 1995 and 2001 and had not  been  politically  active.
   The First-tier Tribunal was aware of his family members'  refugee  status
   (paragraph 33).  The Tribunal referred to the risk factors set out in the
   Country Guidance cases (paragraph 34 and 35) and concluded this Appellant
   was not of sufficiently high profile to excite attention.   That  is  the
   case notwithstanding his family's situation.  They are not  high  profile
   either.  The First-tier Tribunal did not err in its consideration of  the
   risk factors appertaining to this Appellant. If they were high profile it
   would have been a risk factor; they are not.  They do not claim  to  have
   come to the authorities' attention and thus it is unlikely the  CIO  will
   even know anything about them.

12. The second ground asserts that the First-tier Tribunal erred in  failing
   to make a finding  as  to  whether  or  not  the  Appellant's  Sur  Place
   activities resulted from genuine political motivation.  If they did  that
   would inform a finding as to his  likely  behaviour  on  return  (the  HJ
   (Iran) [2009] EWCA Civ 172 principle). At paragraph 30 the Tribunal notes
   the Home Office Presenting Officer's submission that he had taken part in
   the vigils solely for the purpose of bolstering his  asylum  application.
   The  Tribunal  correctly  note  that  his  motivation  is  irrelevant  to
   assessing whether the behaviour puts him at risk.  It is however relevant
   to assessing how he would behave on return.  The Tribunal dealt with this
   at paragraph 39 where it says that it is not satisfied that he would,  on
   past evidence, engage in  political  activities  likely  to  attract  the
   adverse  attention  of  Zanu  PF.   That  reference  to  "past   evidence
   "necessarily includes Sur Place activities  and  the  Tribunal's  finding
   must necessarily be on the basis that he did not attend the vigils due to
   deeply held political views.   If he is not  going  to  indulge  in  such
   activities that is a good indication of his politics; namely he has none.
   He will not have to lie  therefore  if  questioned  about  his  political
   affiliation.

13. The next two grounds relate to the Article 8  claim  and  in  particular
   the Tribunal's finding that the Appellant's partner  could  join  him  in
   Zimbabwe. It is argued that as a British citizen she cannot  be  expected
   to leave the UK and in that regard Miss Radford relied upon Sanade [2012]
   UKUT 00048 (IAC) for her submission that the Secretary  of  State  cannot
   require a British spouse to  leave  the  UK.   That  is  overstating  the
   findings in Sanade and Zambrano.  In those cases there were children  and
   expelling a non EU national necessarily meant the  other  family  members
   had to leave also.  That is not the case here. The Tribunal did  not  err
   in its findings in relation to the Appellant's  partner.  It  provided  a
   very detailed and thorough determination dealing with all of  the  issues
   in  the  case.  It  acknowledged  that  the  Appellant  had  been  in   a
   relationship with his partner for a long time and that she had  stood  by
   him during his imprisonment and had continued to live  with  and  support
   his two sons. She indicated that she was not  prepared  to  join  him  in
   Zimbabwe as is her right. The Tribunal at paragraph  62  correctly  noted
   that the public interest lies in deportation  where  an  Appellant  is  a
   foreign criminal. He did present as a low risk  of  reoffending  and  his
   offences did not involve violence, drugs or  sexual  offending.  However,
   they were  serious  offences  leading  to  a  very  substantial  term  of
   imprisonment and as the Tribunal noted the sentencing judge  referred  to
   the  offending  as  "a  planned,  premeditated,  long-term  fraud  by  an
   intelligent  and  well-informed  man".  An  immediate   and   substantial
   custodial  sentence  was  the  result  notwithstanding  the   Appellant's
   previous good character.

14. The Tribunal noted that the strongest  aspect  of  the  appeal  was  the
   Article 8 claim and in particular his relationship with his  partner.  It
   noted her  stated  intention  not  to  move  with  him  to  Zimbabwe  but
   nevertheless did not think it unreasonable for her to do so. That  was  a
   finding they were entitled to make. This is not a case  which  stands  or
   falls on whether or not the couple are separated. A permanent  separation
   would not outweigh the public interest in deportation and thus whether or
   not his partner would go with him is irrelevant to the outcome. The First-
   tier Tribunal  was  entitled  to  find  that  it  is  a  matter  for  the
   Appellant's partner whether  the  separation  is  permanent.  She  has  a
   choice. She can remain in the  UK  exercising  her  right  as  a  British
   citizen to do so or she can join her partner  in  Zimbabwe.  She  is  not
   expected or required to leave the UK; there is  a  decision  for  her  to
   make.  This is a deportation case not a removal case where the  inability
   of  a  spouse  to  travel  with  the  Appellant  may  be   determinative.
   Accordingly, even if the First-tier Tribunal made an error in finding  it
   reasonable for the partner to leave the  UK,  it  is  immaterial  because
   permanent disruption to the family life enjoyed by the Appellant and  his
   partner would not be  sufficient  to  outweigh  the  public  interest  in
   deportation.

15. Miss Radford also argued that in finding that  the  Appellant's  partner
   could move to Zimbabwe with  the  Appellant  they  failed  to  take  into
   account the effect on the Appellant's son who has mental health problems.
   The Tribunal took full account of his situation.  It noted  that  he  had
   mental health problems. However, it also noted at paragraphs  51  and  52
   that both sons are adult South African citizens neither of whom have  any
   leave to remain in the UK. It noted  that  the  Appellant's  partner  had
   found it difficult, both financially and emotionally to look  after  them
   and had expressed a view that it was time they moved on. Clearly  she  is
   reaching a point in time when she is no longer prepared to undertake  the
   care of the Appellant's sons. That is entirely understandable as they are
   not her responsibility and they have family in the UK. The Tribunal noted
   that at paragraph 52. Furthermore, the son who has mental health problems
   receives  support  from  the  Terrence  Higgins  trust  and  has  a  Care
   Coordinator.  His difficulties have not prevented the Appellant's partner
   from working full-time. The Tribunal therefore cannot  be  said  to  have
   failed to take into account the his situation.  Again  however,  even  if
   they had the  evidence  does  not  support  a  finding  that  either  the
   Appellant's or his partner's care is required by him.

16. The First-tier Tribunal's determination is a carefully crafted  decision
   taking into account  all  of  the  evidence  with  detailed  findings  in
   relation to the Appellant's asylum claim which for sustainable reasons it
   found not made out.  There is a thorough assessment  of  the  Appellant's
   Article 8 claim. At the end of the day this Appellant  committed  a  very
   serious offence for which he received a total prison sentence  of  almost
   four years notwithstanding that it  was  his  first  offence.  It  was  a
   calculated,  materialistic  offence  committed  by  an  intelligent  man.
   Clearly very compelling reasons indeed would be required to outweigh  the
   public interest in his deportation and they are quite simply absent  from
   this case. The  Appellant's  partner  was  in  a  relationship  with  him
   throughout the time of his offending and it  is  unlikely  that  she  was
   ignorant of it albeit she was not involved in it.  The  Appellant's  sons
   have no status in the UK.  In  short,  this  Appellant's  appeal  against
   deportation is without any merit.

17. There is no error of law in the First-tier Tribunal's determination  and
   the appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.
