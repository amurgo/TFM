               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     Mr T Haddow, Advocate, instructed by Latta & Co,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals against a decision by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Hands, promulgated on 26 June 2018.

 2. Ground 2 is headed "error in relation to sur place  activities  in  the
    UK".

 3.  Mr  Matthews  conceded  that  the  decision  does  not  specify   what
    inconsistency was found in relation to the evidence of Mr  Taylor,  and
    that was such an error that the decision could not safely stand.

 4. The following outcome was agreed.

 5. The decision of the FtT is set aside. It stands only  as  a  record  of
    what was said at the hearing.

 6. The nature of the case is such that it is appropriate under section  12
    of the 2007 Act, and under Practice Statement 7.2, to remit to the  FtT
    for an entirely fresh hearing.

 7. The member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case are not to include
    Judge Hands.

 8. The FtT made an anonymity direction, which is maintained.
