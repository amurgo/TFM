Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Allan Briddock instructed by Castle Park
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr A McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a citizen of the Philippines born on 16th March  1969.
    His application for entry clearance as a partner under Appendix  FM  of
    the Immigration Rules was refused by the Respondent  on  11th  December
    2012.   An  appeal  against  that  refusal  was  dismissed  under   the
    Immigration Rules but allowed on human rights grounds  (Article  8)  by
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Jessica Pacey on 2nd January 2014.

 2. Permission to appeal was granted in the  First-tier  Tribunal  on  21st
    January 2014 to the Respondent.  In this determination, and in the hope
    of avoiding confusion, I propose to continue to refer to  Mr  Perez  as
    the Appellant and the Entry Clearance Officer as the Respondent.   Thus
    the matter came before me in the Upper Tribunal on 2nd May 2014.

 3. The Appellant's Sponsor is Ms Dawn Friar.  Ms Friar was present at  the
    hearing and representation was as mentioned above.

 4. In submissions, Mr McVeety relied upon the grounds submitted on  behalf
    of the Respondent in  support  of  an  application  for  permission  to
    appeal.  The grounds state that the  First-tier  Tribunal  allowed  the
    appeal under Article 8, it  having  been  conceded  on  behalf  of  the
    Appellant before the First-tier Tribunal that the requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules were not satisfied.  The grounds submit  that  in  so
    doing the Tribunal erred in law.

 5.  The  first  error,  it  is  argued,  was  the  making  of  a  material
    misdirection  in  law.   The  Appellant's  case  failed  to  meet   the
    requirements of the Rules, however the appeal was  then  allowed  under
    the ECHR.  The grounds submit that it was made clear in Gulshan  [2013]
    UKUT 00640 (IAC) that the Article 8 assessment shall  only  be  carried
    out when there are  compelling  circumstances  not  recognised  by  the
    Rules.  In this case the Tribunal  did  not  identify  such  compelling
    circumstances and it is  submitted  that  its  findings  are  therefore
    unsustainable.  Gulshan also makes clear that at this stage  an  appeal
    should only be  allowed  where  there  are  exceptional  circumstances.
    Nagre [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin) endorsed the respondent's guidance on the
    meaning of exceptional circumstances, namely ones where  refusal  would
    lead to an unjustifiably harsh outcome.  In this case the  ECO  applied
    the law as it stood and therefore treated this case in the same way  as
    any other case would be treated.  This involved  no  prejudice  to  the
    Appellant.

 6. The second ground referred to the First-tier Tribunal's regard  to  the
    relevance of MM [2013]  EWHC  1900  (Admin).   The  judgment  does  not
    dispute the respondent's entitlement to set a minimum income  threshold
    with the aim of ensuring that  those  who  choose  to  establish  their
    family life in the UK should have  the  financial  ability  to  support
    themselves such that the migrant partner does not become  a  burden  on
    the tax payer and is better able to integrate.  The grounds submit that
    in MM the judge usurped the  role  of  the  democratically  accountable
    decision-maker in the formulation of policy and had insufficient regard
    to the width of discretion afforded to the  Respondent  in  formulating
    policy.  In summary, the grounds submit that MM was wrongly decided and
    that the Tribunal erred in relying upon an unsafe authority.

 7. A Rule 24 response, drafted by Mr Briddock, was filed on behalf of  the
    Appellant.  That was adopted and amplified by Mr Briddock in  his  oral
    submission.

 8. The response begins by submitting that the Respondent's grounds, as set
    out in paragraph 1 are misleading.  The  grounds  state  "It  was  made
    clear in Gulshan that the Article 8 assessment shall  only  be  carried
    out when there are compelling reasons not  recognised  by  the  Rules."
    The response points out that this is incorrect.   Paragraph  B  of  the
    head note in Gulshan is then quoted.  The response contends that it  is
    incorrect therefore, and highly misleading, for the ECO to suggest that
    Gulshan "made clear" that  an  Article  8  assessment  should  only  be
    carried when there are compelling circumstances.  The  Tribunal  found,
    in fact, as per Nagre, that an Article  8  assessment  should  only  be
    carried out where there are arguably good grounds  for  granting  leave
    outside the Rules.  This is a  significantly  different  test  to  that
    suggested by the ECO.

 9. Bearing in mind the Tribunal's decision in MM, the response argues that
    it cannot be said that there was not a good arguable  case  that  leave
    should be granted outside the Rules.  Therefore, the ECO was  wrong  in
    law to suggest that the judge erred  in  law  by  looking  outside  the
    Immigration Rules.

10. It is further argued that it is clear from the grounds that the ECO  is
    applying an "exceptionality test".  In MF (Nigeria) the Court of Appeal
    found that there is no exceptionality test.  It is  submitted  that  MM
    has not been overturned and remains good  law.   The  First-tier  Judge
    therefore cannot be criticised for relying on it.

11. In oral submissions, Mr Briddock reminded  me  that  the  date  of  the
    hearing is the relevant date for consideration of human  rights  issues
    under Article 8.  By that date the Sponsor was earning ï¿½20,399 which is
    significantly  more  than  the  minimum  amount  stipulated  under  the
    Immigration Rules.  Evidence to that effect was before  the  First-tier
    Judge and does not appear to be in dispute.

12. The hearing before the First-tier Tribunal took place on 20th  December
    2013 in Birmingham.  The Upper Tribunal's decision in Gulshan had  been
    promulgated only three days earlier, on 17th December 2013.  It is very
    likely that within that short timescale the decision in  Gulshan  would
    not have come to the attention of the First-tier Judge, and she  should
    not be criticised in that respect.  The decisions in Nagre  and  Izuazu
    had  been  properly  referred  to  at  paragraphs  23  and  24  of  the
    determination.

13. In conclusion, Mr Briddock submitted  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal's
    determination disclosed a careful analysis of the law  and  the  facts.
    The First-tier Judge reached conclusions which she was entitled to make
    and there was no error of law.

14. As I indicated having listened to submissions, I am satisfied that  the
    arguments advanced by Mr Briddock on behalf of the Appellant are  well-
    founded.  I am satisfied that the making of the decision by the  First-
    tier Tribunal did not involve the making of a material error of law and
    I therefore uphold  the  determination  and  dismiss  the  Respondent's
    appeal.

No anonymity direction is made.
