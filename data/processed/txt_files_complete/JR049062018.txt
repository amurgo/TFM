                       APPLICATION FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW
                                  JUDGMENT

                          - - - - - - - - - - - - -



        1) These are a written record of the oral reasons given for the
           judgment at the hearing.


       The application


        2) The applicant initially applied on 18  July  2018  for  judicial
           review of a pre-action protocol  response  from  the  respondent
           dated 4 July 2018. That letter re-affirmed an  earlier  response
           dated 2 May 2018, in which the respondent provided  reasons  for
           not having reached a decision on the applicant's application  on
           7 October 2016 for indefinite leave to  remain.  The  challenge,
           therefore, is on the basis of a delay to make a decision, rather
           than to challenge a decision itself.  The applicant sought:
            a.  an order recognising his entitlement to indefinite leave to
               remain on the basis of long residence;
            b. an award of damages for loss of  income  in  the  period  in
               which the respondent had delayed making a  decision  on  his
               application, because he had been forced to quit  a  previous
               job following his leave to remain expiring in 2016; and
            c. damages for breach of his human rights, on  the  basis  that
               the respondent had unlawfully adopted a  blanket  policy  to
               delay consideration of applications for indefinite leave  to
               remain, where applicants  had  previously  used  immigration
               advisers, in earlier, unconnected visa applications,  called
               "Immigration4u",  which  were  then  subject   of   criminal
               investigations. The applicant  was  an  innocent  party;  no
               allegations had been made against him  personally;  and  the
               criminal investigations had since concluded.

       Grant of permission

        3) Following a lengthy litigation history, which it is  unnecessary
           to repeat in full, Upper Tribunal  Judge  Norton-Taylor  granted
           the applicant's application for  reinstatement  of  his  initial
           review challenge (proceedings had  been  previously  compromised
           because of an agreement by  the  respondent  to  issue  a  fresh
           decision by 31 May 2019, absent 'special circumstances'), on the
           basis that the respondent had yet to  reach  a  decision.  Judge
           Norton-Taylor also granted permission to bring  judicial  review
           proceedings, noting in particular  the  respondent's  continuing
           delay in making any decision; the absence of any firm  timeframe
           doing so; and at least  arguable  prejudice  to  the  applicant,
           resulting from the current state of affairs. He  confirmed  that
           the original grounds of challenge did not need to be amended and
           the grant of permission related to all of those grounds.


       Background facts


        4) The background facts are undisputed, unless otherwise indicated.
           For ease of reference, I have adopted the factual background set
           out in the respondent's detailed grounds of defence but in doing
           so  have  also  considered  that  the  applicant's  grounds   of
           challenge; written skeleton  argument;  and  witness  statement;
           together with annexed documents.


        2) The applicant is a Bangladeshi national,  who  lawfully  entered
           the UK on a student visa on 27 September 2006.  He  subsequently
           successfully extended his leave to remain  in  the  UK,  with  a
           grant of leave until 19 November 2012. It was at this stage that
           he made an-in time application for further leave to remain as  a
           Tier 1 (entrepreneur) migrant using immigration advisers  called
           "Immigration4u," which have since been the subject of a criminal
           investigation  under  "Operation   Meeker";   prosecution;   and
           convictions of a number of its officers/employees in relation to
           large-scale attempts to fraudulently obtain entrepreneur  visas.
           There is no allegation at this  stage  that  the  applicant  was
           complicit in this fraud.  Criminal sentencing of 'Immigration4u'
           representatives has since been the subject of widespread  public
           reporting in September 2019.  It is also worth noting  that  the
           respondent had previously informed  the  Upper  Tribunal  on  30
           January  2019  that  the  criminal  convictions   flowing   from
           Operation Meeker, as opposed to sentencing, had been resolved by
           that date.


        3) On 14 March 2014, the applicant applied to vary his  application
           for leave to that of a Tier 4 student, without the assistance of
           "Immigration4u."  The respondent refused that application  in  a
           decision dated 23 June 2015 but provided him with an  in-country
           right of appeal.  He exercised that right  and  his  appeal  was
           dismissed by a First-tier Tribunal in a decision dated 20 August
           2016, a copy of which is not been provided to me, but  to  which
           neither party referred me. The applicant applied for  permission
           to appeal that decision  on  30  September  2016,  but  he  then
           withdrew his appeal.

        4) The applicant's leave to remain, as extended by  section  3C  of
           the Immigration Act  1971,  ended  on  30  September  2016.  The
           consequence is that he has been an overstayer  since  that  date
           and has been unable to work. Nevertheless, within  the  relevant
           "grace period"  permitted  by  the  respondent,  pre-dating  the
           introduction of paragraph 39E  of  the  Immigration  Rules,  the
           applicant applied on 7 October  2016  for  indefinite  leave  to
           remain. He did so using  a  same-day  application  process.  The
           respondent did not make a decision  on  the  same  day  and  the
           applicant had repeatedly chased for a decision since that date.

        5) The applicant has  issued  pre-action  protocol  letters  on  14
           November 2016; 25 April 2017; and 19 April 2018. Permission  was
           initially refused on the papers by Upper Tribunal Judge  Perkins
           on the papers on 21 November 2018. He did so on the  basis  that
           the delay in the respondent's decision was explained (namely the
           applicant's use of a firm of immigration advisers whose  conduct
           had caused concern) and whilst that was not  of  itself  to  the
           applicant's discredit, it was an answer to the allegation  of  a
           public law error in failing to consider the application.





         Grounds


        6) The applicant challenges the respondent's reply on 4  July  2018
           to his pre-action protocol letter.  He has referred to the  fact
           of his engagement with a Bangladeshi proposed partner on 6 March
           2015 whom he has been unable to visit,  and  whose  applications
           for marriage visit visas have been refused on 13 March 2016  and
           19 September 2017.


       Ground one - general delay


        7) The respondent's delay because of Operation Meeker  is  unlawful
           on  public  law  grounds.   His   2012   application   involving
           Immigration4U was superseded by a  subsequent  2014  application
           without their involvement, and  which  in  any  event  has  been
           refused and  so  cannot  be  relevant  to  the  application  for
           indefinite leave to remain. The fact that the respondent  and  a
           First-tier Tribunal were able to reach decisions on his  Tier  4
           student application without delay undermined  any  justification
           for a delay of a decision in respect  of  the  ILR  application.
           There is no time scale in which any  confidence  can  be  placed
           about when the delay in the  ILR  consideration  will  end.  The
           respondent can cancel the  applicant's  ILR  if  there  are  any
           subsequent concerns about the applicant. The  delay  has  caused
           real impact of the applicant because of his  inability  to  work
           and the damage to his career. No sufficient explanation for  the
           continuing delay has been provided.


       Ground two - articles 6 and 8 ECHR


        8) The applicant's inability to work has had as an  impact  on  his
           rights to a private life under article 8 ECHR, and his inability
           to be visited by his fianc�e, which he asserts is been linked to
           Operation Meeker.


        9) The applicant has been subjected to a form of penalty because of
           the  criminal  investigation   and   therefore   qualifies   for
           protection under  article  6  because  his  circumstances  as  a
           "suspect" have  been  substantially  affected  (see:   Deweer  v
           Belgium, 6903/75, [42] and [46]; and Eckle  v  Germany  8130/78,
           [73]).   In terms of any civil proceedings,  the  applicant  has
           not been informed of the nature  and  cause  of  any  accusation
           against him and he has not had a fair and effective  opportunity
           to challenge the interference with article 8 rights.

      Ground three - procedural fairness and absence of reasons

       10) The respondent's application of an indeterminate blanket  policy
           deprives  the  applicant  of  notice,  by  way  of  a   supposed
           justification for the continuing decision to  put  consideration
           of his ILR application.

      Ground four - fetter of discretion


       11) The application of a blanket policy as  a  result  of  Operation
           Meeker amounts to an unlawful fetter by the  respondent  on  her
           discretion to decide the applicant's ILR application.


         The basis of the respondent's resistance to the orders sought

        Ground one - delay


       12) The applicant does not meet the very high threshold, namely that
           a delay must be regarded as manifestly unreasonable or  that  he
           has  suffered  a  particular  detriment  as  a  result  of   the
           respondent's  actions,  which  the  respondent  has  failed   to
           alleviate (see R (FH) v SSHD [2007] EWHC 1571 (Admin) and SSHD v
           Said [2018] EWCA Civ 627.  Far longer periods of delay have been
           regarded as  lawful.  The  assertion  that  the  involvement  of
           'Immigration4u' was immaterial because it related to an  earlier
           application could not be sustained as  if  there  had  been  any
           wrongdoing it would still be material to  the  ILR  application.
           Subsequent  post-grant  cancellation  by  the   respondent   was
           entirely inappropriate as  respondent  needed  to  consider  all
           circumstances in reaching a decision on ILR and if she failed to
           do so, she could be justly criticised. The applicant's  loss  of
           salary because of an  inability  work  was  because  he  was  an
           overstayer who had lost a previous First-tier  Tribunal  appeal.
           The fact that he had chose to remain in UK notwithstanding  that
           decision was the cause of any loss.


       Ground two


       Article 8


       13) The applicant has not made a human rights claim but instead  has
           applied for ILR.  No  authority  has  been  identified  for  the
           proposition that the delay in  making  an  application  for  ILR
           engages article 8. Even if it did, it was plainly proportionate.
           The applicant's inability to work was as a  consequence  of  his
           previous  failed  application  for  leave  to  remain  and   his
           inability to see his family  was  because  of  his  decision  to
           remain in the UK. Statutory  appeals  against  the  respondent's
           refusals of his fianc�e's visit visa  applications  should  made
           separately.


       Article 6


       14) There is no criminal investigation into the  applicant.  Article
           6,  in  relation  to  safeguards  on  criminal  procedures,   is
           therefore  irrelevant.  The  respondent's  consideration  of  an
           immigration visa is not a determination of the applicant's civil
           rights or obligations, which might engage article 6.  Article  6
           does not require the respondent, in the  course  of  reaching  a
           visa  decision,  to  disclose  the  nature  and  cause  of   any
           accusation against him, as the applicant alleges.


       Ground three


       15)  The  respondent  has  provided  an  explanation  for  why   the
           applicant's application has been put on hold. The respondent has
           attempted to reach settlement in respect  of  the  timeframe  in
           which to review the applicant's application.


       Ground four


       16) The respondent has not fettered her discretion and  is  entitled
           to  take  decisions  in  accordance  with  the   generality   of
           applications in which  Immigration4u  may  have  been  involved,
           particularly in light of the guidance formulated in the wake  of
           the Court of Appeal's decision in Balajigari v SSHD [2019]  EWCA
           Civ 673, i.e. the possible adoption  of  a  "minded  to  refuse"
           process.


         Discussion and conclusions


         Ground one

       17) I do not accept Mr Turner's submission that the authority  of  R
           (FH)  v  SSHD  is  limited  in  its  application   or   can   be
           distinguished from the present application, on the basis that it
           dealt with so-called 'legacy cases,' where those applicants  had
           already had previous claims considered and rejected.   I  accept
           that the explanation  for,  and  effect  of,  delay  has  to  be
           considered on a case-by-case basis, but nevertheless the test is
           a high one and there does have to be a delay that is  manifestly
           unreasonable;  or  an  individual  must   have   suffered   some
           particular  prejudice.   I  specifically  reject   Mr   Turner's
           proposition that anything  outside  what  he  described  as  the
           standard response time for an application for  indefinite  leave
           to remain of between eight weeks to  six  months  is  manifestly
           unreasonable.   The  respondent's   published   timeframes   for
           responses,  or  'customer  service  standards'   are   carefully
           caveated to refer to straightforward applications, allowing  for
           departure from those standard timeframes.


       18) I concluded that the delay of just under three and a half  years
           in the applicant's case  was  not  so  manifestly  unreasonable,
           noting that the respondent had  provided  explanations  on  more
           than one occasion for the delay, namely the reference  initially
           to Operation  Meeker;  and  then  in  light  of  Balajigari.  As
           Operation Meeker progressed,  the  respondent  provided  further
           updates, from the  initial  reference  to  it  in  9  May  2017;
           followed by correspondence dated 2 May  2018  at  [177]  of  the
           applicant's bundle, to the applicant being a possible  party  of
           interest, because of his previous use of 'Immigration4U'.

       19) As the respondent's letter of May 2018 went on to discuss, while
           the police investigation was in relation to Immigration4U rather
           than  in  relation  to  the  applicant  directly,  the  eventual
           decision to bring prosecutions was  made  in  March  2018.   The
           criminal trial was scheduled to be finished by the end of August
           2018 and until those proceedings were concluded  the  respondent
           was unable to conclude the applicant's application.  The  letter
           went on to set out the respondent's concerns,  which  I  do  not
           repeat, but suffice it to say, does provide an  explanation  for
           the need for a continuing delay.

       20) The respondent later wrote to the applicant on 30  May  2019,  a
           copy of which was at page [111] of the applicant's bundle.   The
           respondent stated that following a nine-month trial at Southwark
           Crown Court, five defendants were found guilty of conspiracy  to
           defraud the respondent by making false Tier 1  applications  and
           that the applications submitted by Immigration4U used fraudulent
           details.  The respondent stated that the applicant's application
           was amongst those submitted by Immigration4U during the relevant
           period, which was why  he  was  a  party  of  interest  and  his
           application had been put on hold.  The  respondent  stated  that
           although criminal proceedings had now been concluded it was  not
           yet possible to progress the applicant's case.

       21) Following the conclusion of criminal proceedings, the respondent
           indicated that  she  was  reviewing  all  outstanding  Operation
           Meeker applications, to consider the impact that the  trial  had
           those applications in light of the  trial  judge's  findings  in
           respect  of  the  applications  involving  shell   corporations;
           fraudulent documents; and information submitted by the convicted
           representatives of  Immigration4Uon  behalf  of  their  clients.
           Given the broad scope of the criminal proceedings and the number
           of pending cases, the respondent indicated  that  this  exercise
           had taken longer than anticipated.  The respondent  went  on  to
           confirm that she was now developing case handling  instructions,
           which in turn  had  been  impacted  by  the  Court  of  Appeal's
           decision in Balajigari.

       22) The respondent referred, in the same letter of May 2019,  to  an
           earlier adjournment of the judicial review application by  Upper
           Tribunal Rintoul on 30 January  2019  (see  page  [107]  of  the
           applicant's bundle).  The adjournment was made on the basis that
           it appeared that the criminal convictions flowing from Operation
           Meeker had been resolved and that the applicant's case had  been
           allocated to a caseworker section within the respondent and that
           it was anticipated, as at 30 January 2019, that there would be a
           decision within three to  six  months.   In  the  circumstances,
           Judge Rintoul was satisfied that it would be appropriate to stay
           the proceedings for three months in the hope that they could  be
           resolved by consent.

       23) Mr Turner suggested that Judge Rintoul's  adjournment  decision;
           the reference to convictions under Operation Meeker having  been
           resolved; and the applicant's case having been  allocated  to  a
           caseworker section; meant that the applicant had been exonerated
           from any wrongdoing  and  it  followed  that  the  link  between
           Operation Meeker  and  any  subsequent  delay  was  an  entirely
           irrational one.

       24) I do not accept that proposition.  While there is no  allegation
           against  the  applicant  at  this   stage   and   the   criminal
           prosecutions have ended, that does not mean, as  the  respondent
           has  subsequently  made  clear,  that  the  applicant's  use  of
           Immigration4U is irrelevant to  his  ILR  application.   As  the
           respondent stated in the letter of May 2019, she has  needed  to
           consider the criminal findings of large-scale fraud, even if, in
           the applicant's case, she does so by reference  to  a  different
           evidential standard and has  considered  whether,  and  how,  to
           adopt a "minded to refuse" process.  I regard the  link  between
           Operation Meeker and the delay in the respondent's  decision  on
           the applicant's ILR application as rational and explicable.

       25) I further reject an oral submission made by Mr  Turner  for  the
           first  time  today  that  the  reference  to  Balajigari  was  a
           contrived one, in other words, not an additional procedure added
           in good faith to protect the applicant, but instead, a contrived
           process, instigated to justify the delay and defeat the judicial
           review application.  I  accept  Mr  Anderson's  submission  that
           first, that it not a ground of review that has  previously  been
           made and that second, that is an  extremely  serious  allegation
           which, contrary to Mr Turner's submission, cannot reasonably  be
           inferred from the chronology of events, which I have  considered
           in detail.

       26) Instead, I accept Mr Anderson's submission that the delay has to
           be seen in the context of the sentencing judge had described  as
           fraud  "on  an  industrial  scale"  by  the   applicant's   then
           immigration advisers involving a large number of applicants; and
           as the respondent confirmed in  correspondence,  was  explicable
           because  of  the  factual  complexities  of  that   fraud   even
           (including the use of shell companies) even for those  who  were
           not  the  subject  of  criminal  convictions.   It  was  neither
           necessary nor did it follow that because of  the  delay  in  the
           timeframe that the adoption of a minded to  refuse  process  was
           contrived.

       27) Moreover, I reject Mr Turner's submission that the adoption of a
           "minded to refuse" process outside the cohort of cases involving
           discrepancies in tax declarations, as per Balajigari,  could  be
           impugned on public law grounds.  The respondent had referred  to
           Balajigari in the May 2019 letter and while that  has  caused  a
           further delay in reaching a  decision  on  the  applicant's  ILR
           application,  I  do  not  accept  that   Mr   Turner's   further
           submission, that the respondent could grant ILR and then retract
           it,  while  uncertain  of  all  relevant  facts   and   possible
           explanations, was an alternative  that  the  respondent  can  be
           criticised for not following.   In this context, Mr Anderson has
           indicated that a  draft  "minded  to  refuse"  letter  has  been
           drafted and is awaiting final approval, before being sent to the
           applicant shortly.

       28) In the circumstances, I reject the part of the first ground that
           the delay has been manifestly unreasonable; or that the  "minded
           to refuse" process is contrived to justify  an  element  of  the
           delay.

       29) I have considered the second aspect of R  (FH)  v  SSHD  and  in
           particular whether  the  applicant  has  suffered  a  particular
           detriment by virtue of the delay.

       30) There are two areas in which the applicant has asserted that  he
           has suffered particular detriment.  First, he has not been  able
           to work since 2016 when his "3C" leave expired.  Second, he  has
           not been able  to  visit  his  fianc�e  in  Bangladesh  and  her
           applications for visit visas to marry him  have  been  expressly
           refused by reference  to  his  immigration  status,  albeit  for
           additional reasons such as  the  lack  of  funds  by  which  the
           applicant could support his fianc�e.

       31) In relation to the applicant's  ability  to  work,  I  asked  Mr
           Turner whether the applicant had ever applied for permission  to
           work while his ILR application was being considered.  Mr  Turner
           confirmed that he had not, despite the option of doing so  being
           canvassed in Balajigari.  He said that there  was  no  published
           policy indicating that people could do so  and  that  there  was
           every indication that it would have been turned down.

       32) I do not accept Mr Turner's submissions as a satisfactory answer
           to the question of whether the prejudice of not  being  able  to
           work could have  been  avoided  by  the  applicant  pro-actively
           seeking permission to work.   The  applicant  has  been  legally
           advised throughout the period of delay; the well-known authority
           of Balajgari expressly  canvassed  the  possibility  of  working
           prior to ILR applications being resolved; and it is no answer to
           suggest that an application for permission to  work  would  have
           been turned down, when such an application  for  permission  has
           never been made.  There was an alternative potential remedy open
           to the applicant to mitigate the impact of delay, which  he  has
           not pursued.

       33) This  in  turn  impacts  on  the  respondent's  refusal  of  his
           fianc�e's application for leave to enter and marry him.   Whilst
           I accept that the respondent's decision  referred  expressly  to
           the  applicant's  immigration  status,  they  also  referred  to
           concern about his financial means to support  his  fianc�e.   Mr
           Turner accepted in his written skeleton  argument  that  if  the
           applicant's ability to work  had  been  resolved,  there  was  a
           strong possibility that the applicant's fianc�e would have  been
           granted  entry  clearance.   The  applicant's  failure  to  seek
           permission to work therefore impacted directly on his  fiancee's
           entry clearance being refused.

       34) The applicant failed to pursue alternative  ways  of  mitigating
           the impact of delay in relation  to  his  fianc�e  in  a  second
           aspect.  It remained open to the couple to progress a  statutory
           appeal against the refusal of entry clearance in the  First-tier
           Tribunal.  I reject Mr Turner's submission that it is an  answer
           to that lack of challenge, to say that a statutory appeal  would
           have failed, when no such appeal has been made.

       35) In conclusion on ground one, I am satisfied that this is  not  a
           case where the delay in  question  is  manifestly  unreasonable,
           noting the complexity of the matters before the respondent.  The
           respondent has, albeit with delays, explained  the  reasons  for
           doing so and explained, when there was a consent order which had
           provided for  a  decision  absent  'exceptional  circumstances',
           those circumstances.  I also do not regard the  delay  as  being
           the cause of particular detriments to the appellant, where there
           were alternative options for him to pursue, without  needing  to
           leave the UK and abandon his ILR application.

       Ground 2: Articles 6 and 8


       36) These grounds are tied heavily to ground  one.   In  respect  of
           Article 6, Mr Turner,  without  making  any  formal  concession,
           explained that he had not drafted the original grounds  and  had
           no answer to Mr Anderson's submission that  Article  6  was  not
           applicable to a determination of an immigration visa - see R (MK
           (Iran)) v SSHD [2010] EWCA Civ 115.  The undisputed  proposition
           is that the applicant's ILR application is  not  a  civil  right
           which engages Article  6.  There  are  no  criminal  proceedings
           against the applicant. I reject the challenge under Article 6.


       37) In respect of Article 8,  the  respondent's  Acknowledgement  of
           Service and grounds of defence  point  out  that  the  applicant
           makes no reference to any authority for the proposition that his
           rights under Article 8 are engaged. Indeed, it has been left  to
           the respondent to identify one possible  case,  BAC.  v  Greece,
           ECHR application number  11981/2015.   Mr  Turner  responded  by
           indicating that he had not settled the  original  pleadings  and
           relied on the delay as impacting on the applicant's  family  and
           private life.

       38) I accept Mr Anderson's submission  that  BAC  v  Greece  can  be
           distinguished on its facts from the applicant's case.   In  BAC,
           the Greek  statutory  body  had  concluded  that  the  claimant,
           seeking protection, had suffered adverse treatment and the Greek
           procedural  rules  required   that   in   those   circumstances,
           protection status should be confirmed within 24 hours. The Greek
           government had failed to so 12 years' later.  I distinguish that
           case on two grounds.  First, the length of  the  delay  in  that
           case is  inexplicable  in  contrast  to  the  applicant's  case.
           Second, in the case of BAC, the second decision, in  respect  of
           which there  was  such  a  delay,  was  merely  to  confirm  the
           consequences of the first decision, which was not  the  case  in
           the applicant's application.  The applicant's challenge  was  on
           the assumption that his ILR application would succeed,  when  it
           was far from clear that that assumption was a realistic one.

       39) I therefore reject the challenge under Article 8.

       Ground three - procedural fairness and absence of reasons


       40) The applicant's challenge to the  absence  of  reasons  for  the
           delay and lack of details of allegations against him is  covered
           in the analysis of ground  one.   The  respondent  has  provided
           detailed reasons for the delay and the complexity of the  issues
           which impact on the  applicant's  application.  The  applicant's
           challenge that he should be provided with further reasons is not
           consistent with his challenge to the respondent's adoption of  a
           "minded to refuse" process.  The  remainder  of  this  challenge
           amounts, in reality, to a challenge to the delay, which  I  have
           already rejected.


       Ground four - fetter of discretion


       41) Once again, the challenge is, in reality,  one  in  relation  to
           delay.  The applicant challenges the  delay  in  the  respondent
           reaching a decision and in not reaching a decision  straightaway
           whilst she considered not only the complex facts  arising  as  a
           result  of  the   Immigration4U   prosecution   but   also   the
           implementation of a Balajigari-style process for the  applicant.
           As I have indicated, I do not accept  that  the  adoption  of  a
           "minded to refuse" process can be impugned on public law grounds
           nor can the delay be  impugned,  for  reasons   I  have  already
           given.


       Summary of conclusions


       42) The applicant's rights under Articles 6 and 8 of the  ECHR  have
           not been breached.  The delay cannot be impugned on  public  law
           grounds and the  applicant  has  failed  to  pursue  alternative
           remedies to mitigate the  impact  of  the  delay  on  him.   The
           application for judicial review is refused on all grounds.

                      Before Upper Tribunal Judge Keith



Having considered all  documents  lodged  and  having  heard  Mr  P  Turner,
Counsel, instructed by J Stifford Solicitors, on  behalf  of  the  applicant
and Mr J Anderson, Counsel, instructed by the  Government  Legal  Department
on behalf of the respondent at  a  hearing  at  Field  House,  London  on  3
February 2020

It is ordered that


     1) The judicial review application is dismissed in accordance with the
        judgment attached.


     2) I  order,  therefore,  that  the  judicial  review  application  be
        dismissed.

Permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal

     3) The applicant has sought permission  to  appeal  to  the  Court  of
        Appeal, in oral submissions, the gist of which are as follows:
        a. (1) that I had  erred  in  concluding  that  the  delay  in  the
           respondent reaching a decision was  explicable  because  of  the
           complexity of issues being considered by  the  respondent,  when
           the respondent had adduced no evidence on that point.   Contrary
           to that assertion, the judgment refers  to  correspondence  from
           the respondent dated 30 May 2019, constituting evidence, at page
           [111] of the applicant's bundle, which dealt with the complexity
           of those matters, as including shell companies,  and  fraudulent
           documents   and   information   submitted   by   the   convicted
           representatives on behalf of their clients.  I do not regard the
           judgment as disclosing any arguable error of law.
        b. (2) I had erred in concluding that the Court of Appeal  decision
           in Balajigari v SSHD [2019] EWCA Civ 673, was authority for  the
           proposition that those awaiting an ILR decision had the right to
           work. Contrary to that assertion, the  judgment  did  not  state
           that the applicant had the right to work, but  instead,  he  had
           had the option of applying for permission to do so, which he had
           failed to pursue. I do not regard that as disclosing an arguable
           error of law.
        c. (3) I was setting a 'dangerous precedent' in concluding that the
           adoption of a "minded to refuse" process, without its  inclusion
           in a published  policy,  was  not  unlawful.  Contrary  to  that
           assertion, the judgment  does  not  decide  that  a  "minded  to
           refuse" process must be adopted, but  that  in  complex  factual
           scenarios, the adoption of a "minded to refuse"  process,  on  a
           case-by-case basis, may not be impugned on public  law  grounds.
           That aspect of the judgment discloses no arguable error of law.
        d. (4) I had erred in linking the delay in the respondent  reaching
           her decision to 'Operation  Meeker.'   The  judgment  considered
           this at length at paragraph [19] to [24]. The  assertion  of  an
           arguable error of law amounts, in  reality,  to  a  disagreement
           with the conclusions in the judgment.

     4) I therefore refuse permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal  for
        the same reasons that I have refused the orders sought for judicial
        review.


   Costs


     5) I did not accept Mr Turner's submission that the  respondent  would
        not have been at the stage of being about to reach  a  decision  on
        ILR, unless she had been prompted  to  do  so  by  the  threat  and
        progression of judicial review.   For  the  reasons  given  in  the
        judgment attached, the applicant's challenge  to  the  respondent's
        delay in reaching a decision has failed and it has been open to the
        applicant to seek alternative means of mitigating the impact of the
        delay on him.  In the circumstances, as his application has failed,
        on the merits, on all grounds, I order that the applicant shall pay
        the respondent's reasonable costs, to be assessed, if not agreed.

       Notification of appeal rights


      A decision by the Upper Tribunal on an application for judicial review
      is a decision that disposes of proceedings.


       A party may appeal against such a decision to the Court of Appeal  on
      a question of law only. Any party who wishes to appeal should apply to
      the Upper Tribunal  for  permission,  at  the  hearing  at  which  the
      decision is given. If  no  application  is  made,  the  Tribunal  must
      nonetheless  consider  at  the  hearing  whether  to  give  or  refuse
      permission to appeal (rule 44(4B) of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
      Tribunal) Rules 2008).


      If  the  Tribunal  refuses  permission,  either  in  response  to   an
      application or by virtue of rule 44(4B), then  the  party  wishing  to
      appeal can apply for permission from the Court of Appeal itself.  This
      must be done by filing an applicant's notice with  the  Civil  Appeals
      Office of the  Court  of  Appeal  within  28  days  of  the  date  the
      Tribunal's decision on permission to appeal was sent (Civil  Procedure
      Rules Practice Direction 52D 3.3).
