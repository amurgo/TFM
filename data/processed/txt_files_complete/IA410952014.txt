                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal  against  a  decision  of  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal N Bowes, who in a decision promulgated  on  22nd  April  2015,
    dismissed the appellant's appeal against a refusal by the Secretary  of
    State to vary his leave to remain as a student  on  the  basis  of  his
    private life in the United Kingdom and to exercise  her  discretion  in
    her favour outside of the Immigration Rules.



Background

2.   The appellant, whose date of birth is 31st December 1980, is a  citizen
    of Bangladesh.  He lawfully entered the United Kingdom in October  2009
    as a student. He was granted further periods of leave to remain in  the
    same category. His leave was however curtailed to 23rd March 2014 as  a
    result of difficulties with his sponsoring educational institution. The
    appellant made an application on 20th July 2014 for leave to remain  on
    the basis both of his private life and also  exceptionally  outside  of
    the Immigration Rules. This application was treated as  being  made  in
    time  by  the  respondent  who  had  given  the  appellant  appropriate
    assurances and no issue has been raised in respect  of  the  tribunal's
    jurisdiction to consider the appeal.

3.   The application made to the  Secretary  of  State  indicated  that  the
    appellant's sight had deteriorated. His vision had become  blurred  and
    cloudy. He had been offered a corneal transplant but this  did  not  go
    ahead because he was concerned that it would affect his  studies.   His
    eye condition however deteriorated to such an extent that he was unable
    to continue his studies. The appellant was  suffering  from  rheumatoid
    arthritis and was, in this regard, undergoing trials at King's  College
    Hospital.

4.   On 18th September 2014 the appellant  sent  a  further  letter  to  the
    respondent. In this letter he indicated again  that  he  was  suffering
    from  severe  rheumatoid  arthritis  which  was  affecting  his   liver
    function. He indicated that he had granular dystrophy  and  dry  ocular
    surface to his eyes that resulted in him being unable to  see  or  read
    properly.

5.   He indicated to the Secretary of State that he  had  been  residing  in
    the UK since October 2009 and, as a result, had built up a private  and
    family life with the expectation that he would be able  to  finish  his
    studies.  He indicated that it would be a  huge  disgrace  for  him  to
    return to Bangladesh if he did not complete his  course  and  requested
    that the Secretary of State grant his application under the Immigration
    Rules. Alternatively, the Secretary of State was asked to consider  his
    application under Article 8.  In this regard the  appellant  maintained
    that he would be unable to find  suitable  shelter,  medical  or  other
    lifesaving support and that were his basic needs as a human being would
    not be met.

The Reasons For Refusal Letter

6.   The Secretary of  State  was  not  satisfied  that  the  appellant  had
    fulfilled the requirements  of  paragraph  276ADE  of  the  Immigration
    Rules. The only subparagraph of relevance for the purposes of the error
    of law hearing is 276ADE(vi). This requires very significant  obstacles
    to an individual's integration into their home  country  for  leave  to
    remain to be granted.  The  Secretary  of  State,  satisfied  that  the
    appellant had lived in Bangladesh for 28 years and had his parents  and
    siblings there, was not satisfied that very  significant  obstacles  to
    integration existed.

7.   Significantly, the Secretary of State then  went  on  to  consider  the
    appellant's  circumstances  outside  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   The
    Secretary of State noted the  appellant's  medical  condition  and  his
    intention to  complete  his  studies.  She  identified  a  hospital  in
    Bangladesh  where  corneal  transplant  surgery   could   occur.    She
    identified faculties in Bangladesh  offering  treatment  of  rheumatoid
    arthritis and listed available relevant medication. The  appellant  had
    not produced any evidence  that  he  had  been,  or  would  be,  denied
    treatment or medication, and he had family support in  Bangladesh.  The
    Secretary of State was therefore not satisfied that the high  threshold
    that he needed to overcome in respect of medical treatment cases  under
    both Articles 3 and 8 was met, and she rejected the  appellant's  claim
    that he had a legitimate expectation that he would be able to  complete
    his studies.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal

8.   At an appeal hearing on 12th May 2015 it was argued on  behalf  of  the
    appellant that the respondent  should  have  exercised  her  discretion
    differently, and that the decision was unfair according to  common  law
    fairness principles. It was  also  claimed  that  the  refusal  of  the
    application  for  leave  and  the  removal  decision  contravened   the
    respondent's obligations under Article 8.

9.   Paragraph 10 of the determination notes that,  at  the  outset  of  the
    hearing, it was agreed between the parties  that  the  issues  for  the
    judge's consideration were whether the appellant met  paragraph  276ADE
    and, if not, whether he could resist his proposed removal on the  basis
    of his Article 8 rights. We pause  to  note  at  this  point  that  the
    appellant was represented by Mr Chelliah of Simon Noble Solicitors.

10.  In his determination the judge recorded the evidence presented  at  the
    hearing. This included details of the appellant's  medical  conditions,
    his dreams of studying in the United Kingdom, his feelings of  disgrace
    and hopelessness if he was unable to complete his studies, and  details
    of his family in Bangladesh which consisted of his elderly parents, one
    brother and two sisters.

11.  The judge found the appellant credible and his medical conditions  were
    found to be as stated in  the  various  medical  documents.  The  judge
    indicated that the question  for  his  consideration  was  whether  the
    appellant met the Immigration Rules and/or a breach of Article  8.  The
    judge went on to  consider  paragraph  276ADE(vi)  and  concluded  that
    feelings of shame and the appellant's medical conditions did not amount
    to very  significant  obstacles  in  light  of  the  available  medical
    treatment in Bangladesh,  as  disclosed  in  the  Reasons  For  Refusal
    Letter, the fact that he would be able to rely on family  support,  and
    in light of the fact that the appellant entered the United  Kingdom  in
    his 20s.

12.  The judge then went on  to  consider  the  appellant's  'free-standing'
    Article 8 right. The judge indicated that there had  to  be  compelling
    circumstances in order to  allow  an  appeal  outside  the  immigration
    rules, and adopted  the  five  step  Razgar  approach.  The  judge  was
    satisfied that the appellant had established  a  private  life  in  the
    United Kingdom. The judge found the decision to  remove  the  appellant
    was  lawful  and  in  pursuit  of  a  legitimate  aim.  When  assessing
    proportionality the judge took account of Part 5A of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  The judge noted  that  the  appellant
    was proficient in English and found the  appellant  to  be  financially
    independent, factors in his favour.

13.  The judge then  noted  that  the  public  interest  in  maintenance  of
    effective immigration control was a relevant factor and noted that  the
    appellant's position in the United Kingdom had always  been  precarious
    as he had never been granted indefinite leave to remain and was not  in
    a category leading to settlement.

14.  The judge concluded that the appellant's private  life  could  continue
    in Bangladesh.  The judge also concluded, with reference to the case of
    GS (India) [2015] EWCA Civ  40,  that  the  appellant  being  'mentally
    upset' was not sufficient to amount to truly exceptional circumstances.

The Grounds of Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

15.  The appellant, aggrieved  with  this  decision,  sought  permission  to
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal. In a decision dated 23rd June 2015  Judge
    of the First-tier Tribunal Page granted permission. The judge,  mindful
    of the fact that the appellant was not legally  represented,  indicated
    that the First-tier Tribunal had given great weight to the availability
    of treatment for the appellant's condition in Bangladesh but found that
    it arguable that this was not of such great weight.  Judge Page stated:

         "The appellant's application argues that he made his further  leave
         to remain application on the basis of  his  exceptional  compelling
         circumstances and therefore could not satisfy the English  language
         requirements to obtain a CAS which is  why  he  applied  under  the
         further leave to remain route outside of the Immigration  Rules  to
         obtain discretionary leave so that he could complete his education.
          The permission to appeal application argues that the judge did not
         consider the facts properly  by  not  considering  the  exceptional
         circumstances  in  their  context.   The   permission   to   appeal
         application complains that neither the  respondent  nor  the  judge
         considered whether discretion should be  exercised.   Further,  the
         judge found that although the appellant was a credible witness  his
         case was not truly exceptional.  The application  argues  that  the
         judge was in error here as the truly exceptional circumstances that
         should have been considered were  the  appellant's  medical  issues
         arising from his visual impairment."

The hearing before the Upper Tribunal

16.  We heard from both the appellant and  Mr  Tufan,  who  represented  the
    Secretary of State.  The appellant initially requested  an  adjournment
    in order to obtain a lawyer to represent him. We refused to  grant  the
    adjournment. The appellant had been informed for approximately a  month
    prior to the hearing date of the time and place of the  Upper  Tribunal
    hearing.  We  were  satisfied  that  the   appellant   had   sufficient
    opportunity to instruct a lawyer. We were mindful  of  the  appellant's
    complaint of feeling sick and his mobility difficulties. We  were  not,
    however, persuaded that this would have prevented  the  appellant  from
    using  remote  forms  of  communication  to  instruct  a   lawyer.   We
    additionally note that the appellant was able to travel to the  hearing
    centre and appear before the  Upper  Tribunal.  Having  regard  to  the
    overriding objective in the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 and the authority of Nwaigwe (adjournment: fairness)  [2014]  UKUT
    00418 (IAC), and bearing in mind the narrow issue before  us,  we  were
    satisfied the Appellant was not deprived  of  a  fair  hearing  by  our
    refusal to grant the adjournment.

17.  The appellant then made submissions. He indicated  that  he  could  not
    get his CAS letter because he had not obtained a suitable mark  in  his
    English exam, and this in  turn  was  due  to  his  inability  to  read
    properly. He indicated that he was in the United  Kingdom  to  complete
    his education. We  considered  further  letters  from  the  appellant's
    medical practitioners in relation to his eye condition.  The  appellant
    indicated that he was worried that he  would  not  be  able  to  obtain
    sufficient treatment in Bangladesh.

18.  Mr Tufan in reply invited us to find that the judge had  not  made  any
    material error in law. He referred us to the case of Patel v  Secretary
    of State for the Home Department [2012] EWCA Civ 741 in relation to the
    position of a student vis-�-vis Article 8.

Discussion

19.  We have  considerable  sympathy  for  the  appellant.  We  are  however
    restricted in our consideration of the appeal  before  us  to  deciding
    whether the First-tier Tribunal Judge made a material error of law.  At
    the hearing before the First-tier  Tribunal  it  was  agreed  that  the
    issues were: 1) whether the appellant met the requirements of paragraph
    276ADE of the Immigration Rules; and 2) in the alternative, whether his
    removal would breach Article 8. It was not apparent from the manner  in
    which the appeal was argued at first  instance  that  the  exercise  of
    discretion, either by the Secretary of State or by the  judge,  was  in
    issue.

20.  In  any  event,  we  must  have  regard  to  Section  86(3)(b)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 as it was at the  date  of
    the decision. This enables the First-tier Tribunal to allow  an  appeal
    against an immigration decision insofar as it thinks that a  discretion
    exercised in making a decision against which the appeal is brought,  or
    is treated as being brought, should have  been  exercised  differently.
    But Section 86(6) of the same Act indicates that a  refusal  to  depart
    from, or to authorise departure from the Immigration Rules, is not  the
    exercise of a discretion for the purposes of Section (3)(b).   This  is
    confirmed in the case of Patel at Section 57.  This states, in material
    part:

         "It is important to remember  that  Article  8  is  not  a  general
         dispensing power.  It is to be distinguished from the Secretary  of
         State's discretion to allow leave  to  remain  outside  the  Rules,
         which may be unrelated to any protected human right.  The merits of
         a decision not to depart from  the  Rules  are  not  reviewable  on
         appeal: Section 86(6)."

21.  The First-tier Tribunal Judge was, as a result, simply not entitled  to
    consider the merits of the Secretary of State's exercise of  discretion
    outside of the Rules. We acknowledge that a First-tier  Tribunal  judge
    can  consider  whether  the  exercise  of  a  discretion  outside   the
    immigration rules was lawful. It does not appear that  this  judge  was
    invited to do so. However, even if we are wrong in this conclusion,  we
    are satisfied, having regard to the content of the Reasons For  Refusal
    Letter, that the Secretary of State  did  not  act  unlawfully  in  the
    exercise of her residual discretion outside of the  Immigration  Rules.
    The reasons for refusal letter specifically engaged  with  the  factors
    identified by the appellant  as  being  relevant  to  the  exercise  of
    discretion.

22.  In her Reasons For Refusal Letter the  Secretary  of  State  noted  the
    appellant's medical  conditions  and  his  intention  to  complete  his
    studies. The  Secretary  of  State  investigated  the  availability  of
    medical treatment in Bangladesh and concluded,  on  the  basis  of  the
    evidence before her, that such treatment was available.  The  Secretary
    of  State  identified  hospitals  at  which  treatment  for  rheumatoid
    arthritis could be obtained and indicated that relevant medication  was
    available. These were conclusions  that  the  Secretary  of  State  was
    lawfully entitled to reach on the basis of the  evidence  presented  to
    her.

23.  We are not satisfied either that the First-tier Judge materially  erred
    in his approach to paragraph 276ADE of the immigration rules and in his
    approach to the Appellant's freestanding Article 8 right. At paragraphs
    19 and 20 the judge gave proper reasons for concluding that there  were
    no very significant obstacles to the appellant's return to  Bangladesh.
    The judge fully considered the extent of the appellant's  private  life
    in the United Kingdom and the impact of  removal  applying  the  proper
    test (paragraphs 22 to 28 of the decision).

24.  We additionally note the case of Patel which  indicates,  at  paragraph
    57, that the opportunity for a promising student to complete his course
    in this country, however desirable in general terms, is not in itself a
    right protected under Article 8.

25.  Finally, the appellant maintained that the treatment that  he  requires
    is  simply  not  available  in  Bangladesh.  However,  the  authorities
    relating to the differences in  medical  treatment  between  countries,
    notably "D" v United Kingdom (UK) 0030240-96 and N v the United Kingdom
    (App no. 26565/05), indicate that an extremely high threshold needs  to
    be overcome before either Article 3 or Article 8 is  engaged.   Further
    support comes from the authority already cited of GS (India).

26.  In these circumstances, and in light of the nature of  the  appellant's
    medical condition as disclosed in the evidence both before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal and us, we are satisfied  that  the  seriousness  of  the
    appellant's medical condition is not of a sufficient degree that  would
    trigger the protection under  both  Articles  3  and  8  and  in  these
    circumstances we dismiss the appeal.

Notice of Decision

The First-tier Tribunal made no error of law.  The  appeal  is  consequently
dismissed both on human rights grounds and under the immigration rules.
