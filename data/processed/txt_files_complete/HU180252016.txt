                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    This is an appeal by the appellant against a decision  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal dated 13 December 2017 dismissing his appeal against  the
    respondent's decision of 6 July 2016  refusing  him  further  leave  to
    remain on human rights grounds.

Background

2.    The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born on  23  January  1983.   He
    entered the UK on 15 December 2013 as a Tier 5 TW  (Cre-sport)  migrant
    with leave to remain valid until  7  January  2014.   After  his  leave
    expired, he remained in the UK.  On 16 March 2016 he applied for  leave
    to remain on the basis of his family and private life.

3.    The respondent's decision is set  out  in  Annex  A  of  the  decision
    letter of 6 July 2016. She was not satisfied  that  the  appellant  was
    able to meet the suitability requirements of para 276ADE(1)(i)  of  the
    Rules at the date of application as he fell within S-LTR 2.3 as someone
    who had failed to pay outstanding charges in respect of NHS  treatment.
    He had been receiving dialysis treatment and  had  accrued  a  debt  of
    ï¿½32,983.  The respondent also did not accept that the  appellant  could
    meet any of the requirements of para 276ADE(iii) - (vi).  He  had  only
    lived in the UK for two years and he could not  show  that  there  were
    very significant obstacles to his integration into Nigeria on return.

4.    The respondent went on to  consider  whether  there  were  exceptional
    circumstances which might warrant a grant of leave to remain in the  UK
    outside the requirements of  the  Rules.  The  appellant  had  produced
    evidence that he was suffering from chronic kidney disease and had been
    diagnosed with end-stage renal disease and small kidneys.  She accepted
    that the respondent was going to need dialysis for the rest of his life
    unless he could have a kidney transplant.  According to the Country  of
    Origin ("COI") information, treatment  was  available  in  Nigeria  but
    having dialysis three times a week would be difficult and it would  not
    be possible to  have  a  renal  transplant.   The  respondent  was  not
    satisfied that the appellant could bring himself within article  3  and
    there were no further factors  which  could  be  considered  to  be  so
    exceptional to override  the  legitimate  requirements  of  immigration
    control within article 8.

The Hearing before the First-tier Tribunal

5.    At the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal the appellant  confirmed
    that he was suffering from chronic kidney disease and  having  dialysis
    three times week.  He said that if he returned to Nigeria, he would die
    because he could not get treatment there. His home town was  Enugu  and
    the nearest  government  hospital  was  at  the  University  of  Nssaka
    Teaching Hospital but there were  no  facilities  there  for  dialysis.
    According to his research, only two  government  hospitals  in  Nigeria
    provided such services and they were based in Lagos  and  Ibadan.   The
    judge accepted the evidence about the appellant's medical condition and
    the diagnosis of end-stage renal disease, but he  did  not  accept  his
    evidence that he had not left the UK at the  expiry  of  his  leave  in
    January 2014 because he had been diagnosed with renal problems  shortly
    before he was due to leave, the letter dated 21 June  2016  from  South
    West Thames Renal and Transplantation Unit referring to  the  appellant
    being diagnosed with end-stage renal disease in May 2015 [44].

6.    At the outset of the appeal, the judge  had  asked  the  appellant  to
    clarify the basis of his human rights claim and he said that he  simply
    wanted to make his claim based on his ill health and nothing else.  The
    judge commented that, as it was the appellant's  case  that  he  had  a
    partner who  was  pregnant  with  his  child,  he  gave  him  a  second
    opportunity to clarify the basis of his claim, but he  reiterated  that
    he wanted the Tribunal to consider the claim on the basis  of  his  ill
    health [46].

7.    The judge took no issue with the  evidence  the  appellant  had  given
    about his private life established in this country but said that  there
    was insufficient evidence  to  make  any  findings  about  his  claimed
    relationship with a British national or any  other  family  or  private
    life he may  have  [48].   So  far  as  the  position  in  Nigeria  was
    concerned, the appellant had said that he had no family, no property or
    assets left there but the judge did not find that he was  being  candid
    about these issues.  He had come to the UK as a 30-year old in December
    2013 and was only supposed to stay for a few weeks, being due to  leave
    in January 2014.  He found that it was reasonable to conclude that  the
    appellant would have established a life for himself in Nigeria  and  he
    did not accept that by the time he had  submitted  his  application  in
    2016, he had lost all material ties to that country [49-51].

8.    The judge reviewed the case law about when medical grounds could  give
    rise to a successful claim under  article  3  and  in  particular  N  v
    Secretary of State [2005] UKHL 31 and GS India and others  v  Secretary
    of State [2015] EWCA Civ 40. He considered the impact of  Paposhvili  v
    Belgium (41738/10) ECtHR, Grand Chamber and EA (article 3 medical cases
    - Paposhvili not applicable) [2017]  UKUT  445  on  whether  Paposhvili
    applied in the light of current domestic jurisprudence.

9.    The judge accepted at [55] that the appellant had been diagnosed  with
    end-stage renal  disease  and,  having  been  operated  on  at  an  NHS
    hospital, he was able to survive post-operation because he  attended  a
    dialysis unit three times a week.  He was not entitled to NHS treatment
    and both his operation and his ongoing dialysis was being paid  for  by
    the taxpayer.  Unless he received a kidney transplant,  he  would  need
    dialysis for the rest of his life.   However,  the  case  law  did  not
    enable the appellant to  meet  the  very  high  threshold  required  to
    establish a claim under article 3 even with his serious  condition  and
    his lack of means to manage his condition in Nigeria.  The  judge  took
    note of Paposhvili commenting that that judgment appeared  to  open  up
    the possibility of someone in the  appellant's  predicament  succeeding
    under article 3 but that ran counter to binding domestic law which  had
    to take precedence [60].  For  these  reasons,  the  appeal  could  not
    succeed under article 3.

10    The judge went on to consider article 8 but found  that,  even  taking
    his claim at its highest, the appeal could not  succeed  on  article  8
    grounds   and   the   respondent's   decision   to   remove   was   not
    disproportionate to a legitimate aim.

11.   The judge commented finally at [68] as follows:
         "These types of appeals are amongst the most difficult  which  this
         Tribunal has to deal with.  Whilst the Tribunal has every  sympathy
         with the appellant and the difficulty which he  finds  himself  in,
         the dispassionate exercise of the law means that any sympathy which
         the Tribunal may have for the appellant's predicament has to be put
         to one side.  The law, as it  stands,  is  very  much  against  the
         appellant and therefore with a very heavy heart I have  to  dismiss
         his claim under both article 3 and article 8 ECHR."

The Grounds of Appeal
12.   In the grounds of appeal submitted on the appellant's  behalf,  it  is
    argued that the judge failed to apply the correct  legal  test  in  the
    light of the judgment in the Paposhvili; failed  to  make  findings  on
    article 8 and in particular para 276ADE(1)(vi) and that there had  been
    procedural unfairness in that documents submitted with the  appellant's
    application were not brought to the attention of the  Tribunal.   These
    included  his  parents'  death  certificates  and  a   medical   report
    confirming that he had been diagnosed with chronic  kidney  disease  in
    2013.

13.   When granting permission  to  appeal  the  First-tier  Tribunal  judge
    identified the following arguable issues: the judge had been unable  to
    take into account evidence which the appellant  had  submitted  to  the
    respondent initially; in carrying  out  the  proportionality  exercise,
    consideration should have been given to the criteria in para 276 ADE in
    relation to the existence or otherwise of very  significant  obstacles;
    the reason for the suitability criteria not being met was  the  decline
    in the health of the  appellant;  these  factors  together  with  other
    matters relating to the existence of very  significant  obstacles  were
    pertinent  to  the  degree  which  the  Rules  were  capable  of  being
    satisfied; the assessment of the public interest and the enforcement of
    effective immigration control had therefore been  affected;  the  judge
    should have set out a more extensive analysis  in  the  proportionality
    exercise of  the  factors  bearing  on  the  existence  of  significant
    obstacles;  given  that  the  appellant  was  unrepresented,  inquiries
    capable of being made by the respondent in relation to specific country
    issues should have been utilised and, finally, given that the appellant
    was unrepresented there should have been a more extensive  analysis  of
    the question whether there was a breach of  article  8  in  respect  of
    physical and moral integrity.

14.   At the hearing before me there was no appearance by or  on  behalf  of
    the appellant.  I am satisfied that the  notice  of  hearing  has  been
    properly served and there is no explanation for his failure to  appear.
    In these circumstances, I am satisfied that the  proper  course  is  to
    proceed with the hearing.  Mr Tufan did not seek to  make  any  further
    submissions on behalf of the respondent save to remind me of the recent
    decision of the Court of Appeal in AM (Zimbabwe) v Secretary  of  State
    [2018] EWCA 64.

Assessment of the issues
15.   I must assess whether the First-tier Tribunal erred in law  such  that
    the decision should be set aside.  The first issue is whether the judge
    applied the correct  legal  test  in  the  light  of  the  judgment  in
    Paposhvili.  In EA, the Upper Tribunal held that  the  Paposhvili  test
    was not one which was open to the Tribunal to apply as it was  contrary
    to binding precedent set out in the House  of  Lords'  opinions  in  N.
    This decision  has  been  confirmed  by  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  AM
    (Zimbabwe), the Court repeating at  [33]  that  all  Courts  below  the
    Supreme Court are bound by the decision in N.  The  Court  went  on  to
    consider the effect of the judgment in  Paposhvili  accepting  that  it
    relaxed the test for a violation of article 3 in medical cases but only
    did so to a very modest extent: see [39]-[41].  However,  the  position
    remains that N is a binding authority and the judge did not err in  law
    by taking the view that,  whilst  Paposhvili  may  have  reignited  the
    debate over the high threshold set by domestic case  law,  it  did  not
    affect the binding jurisprudence in the UK [69].
16.   It is further argued that the judge should have made more findings  in
    respect of article 8 and in particular para 276ADE(1)(vi).  This ground
    is expanded in in the grant of permission to  appeal,  particularly  in
    the context of the assessment of very significant obstacles  and  their
    bearing on the analysis of proportionality.  The  judge  may  not  have
    specifically referred to para 276ADE in his decision,  but  he  clearly
    had it in mind and dealt with the relevant issues, particularly at [51]
    finding that the appellant had not lost all material  ties  to  Nigeria
    and had not been candid about his circumstances there and was unable to
    show that there  were  significant  obstacles  to  him  integrating  on
    return, having initially come to the UK supposedly for a few weeks  and
    there being no adequate  basis  for  a  finding  that  there  would  be
    significant obstacles to him integrating into Nigeria.   In  short,  he
    found that there were no significant  obstacles  to  him  returning  to
    Nigeria over and above his medical condition.

17.   The judge considered article 8 in the context of  private  life.   The
    grounds raise the issue of  whether  there  should  have  been  a  more
    extensive analysis in the light of the evidence about  the  appellant's
    family life, but the judge raised that issue with the  appellant  ([14]
    and [44]) and he was clear that he wished  to  proceed  purely  on  the
    basis of grounds relating to his ill health.  In  these  circumstances,
    the judge was entitled to find that there was simply a lack of evidence
    of family life.  On the issue of physical and moral  integrity,  in  GS
    (India), the Court of Appeal made it clear that if article 3 could  not
    be met on medical grounds, article 8 would not succeed unless there was
    some separate or additional factual element bringing  the  case  within
    the article 8 paradigm [40]. The judge referred at [40] to the comments
    of Underhill LJ at para 111 of GS (India) where he said,
         "First, the absence or inadequacy of medical treatment,  even  life
         preserving treatment, in the country of return, cannot be relied on
         at all as a fact engaging article 8: if that is all there  is,  the
         claim must fail.  Secondly, where article 8  is  engaged  by  other
         factors, the fact that the claimant is receiving medical  treatment
         in this country which may or may not be available in the country of
         return may be a factor in the proportionality  exercise;  but  that
         factor cannot be treated as by itself giving rise to a breach since
         that would contravene the 'no obligation to treat' principle".

18.   The judge accepted that the appellant had established a  private  life
    in this country but was entitled to note that this was when  his  leave
    was precarious.  He considered the provisions of s. 117B  of  the  2002
    Act and the case law referred to in [66].  I am not satisfied that  any
    matters capable of affecting the  assessment  of  proportionality  were
    left out of account.

19.   The grounds also raise the  issue  of  whether  there  was  procedural
    unfairness in that documents submitted by the appellant in  support  of
    his application did not come to the attention of the judge.  The  death
    certificates of his parents were included in the  bundle  of  documents
    submitted by the respondent and would have been before the judge.   The
    grounds refer to a medical  report  to  show  that  the  appellant  was
    diagnosed with kidney disease in 2013 but assuming that the  judge  was
    unaware of it, I am satisfied that it would have had no bearing on  the
    outcome of the appeal.  It may have  cast  a  different  light  on  the
    judge's finding that the appellant had only been diagnosed with  kidney
    disease in 2015 but, even assuming the diagnosis was made earlier, that
    would not have affected the outcome of the appeal.  It was argued that,
    as the appellant was unrepresented, the  respondent  should  have  made
    enquiries about specific country issues but there is  no  substance  in
    this ground.  The respondent did make such enquiries and relied on  the
    Nigerian COI report about the treatment available in Nigeria.

20.   In summary, I am not satisfied that the judge erred in law in any  way
    capable of affecting the outcome of the appeal.  He reached a  decision
    properly open to him on the basis of the law as it currently stands.

Decision

21.   The First-tier Tribunal did not err in law and its decision stands.
