For the Respondent:    Mr D Mills, a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer



                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Mohsin Yakub Haji Mohmed Patel, was born  on  8  January
    1985 and is a male citizen of India.  He  appealed  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge T  R  P  Hollingworth)  against  the  decision  of  the
    respondent dated  20  November  2013  to  refuse  to  grant  him  entry
    clearance as a spouse under Appendix FM of HC  395  (as  amended)  with
    regard to paragraph EC-P1.1.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  dismissed  his
    appeal in a  decision  dated  20  November  2014.   The  appellant  now
    appeals, with permission, to the Upper Tribunal.

 2. Mrs Bull of Counsel, who  appeared  for  the  appellant  at  the  Upper
    Tribunal hearing, told me that her client did not rely  upon  paragraph
    2(i) of the grounds.  The appellant continued to rely upon  the  ground
    in respect of paragraph 320(11) of HC 395.  He contends that the First-
    tier Tribunal Judge erred in law by stating that the burden of proof as
    regards the refusal under paragraph 320(11) lay with the appellant, and
    not the respondent.

 3. In the refusal of 20 November 2013, the ECO  set  out  the  appellant's
    immigration history.  The appellant had entered the United Kingdom as a
    working holidaymaker on a visa granted to him on 6  December  2009.   A
    recipient of such a working holidaymaker's visa was  only  entitled  to
    work for a maximum of twelve months out of the two year period  of  the
    visa and the respondent considered "that you  were  employed  for  more
    than this, you breached a condition attached to the leave that you  had
    been granted."  The appellant had overstayed his visa  for  over  three
    years until  April  2013.   He  had  been  encountered  by  Immigration
    Officers on 6 February 2011 but released on the  basis  that  he  would
    obtain emergency travel documentation.  The  appellant  had  failed  to
    report to Immigration Officers after that date.  He had married  whilst
    in the UK and had only returned to India in April 2013 "on  the  advice
    of your solicitor who recommended you to apply in your home country for
    settlement as a spouse."  The ECO had concluded,

         "I have taken into account your previous immigration history  where
         you have repeatedly contrived to frustrate the  Immigration  Rules.
         I am satisfied you have previously contrived in a  significant  way
         to frustrate the intentions of these Rules  (paragraph  320(11)  HC
         395 as amended)."

 4. The judge stated [3] that "the burden of proof is on the appellant  and
    the standard of proof is the balance of  probabilities."   He  made  no
    further reference to  the  burden  of  proof  and  Mr  Mills,  for  the
    respondent, accepted that the judge had erred  in  law  by  failing  to
    state that the burden of proof  in  the  paragraph  320(11)  allegation
    rested on the respondent, and not the appellant (JC  (Part  9  HC  395;
    burden  of  proof)  China  [2007]  UKAIT  00027).   However,  Mr  Mills
    submitted that the error was  immaterial.   He  pointed  out  that  the
    immigration history of the appellant (which I have set out  above)  had
    been agreed by both parties before the First-tier Tribunal.  Therefore,
    whilst it was for the respondent to establish the facts  pertaining  to
    the refusal under paragraph 320(11) she had done so because those facts
    had been agreed; the question of upon whom the burden of proof fell was
    nugatory as a result.

 5. At [22] the judge recorded that

         "It is apparent  from  the  interview  referred  to  in  the  first
         paragraph of the respondent's reasons  letter  that  the  appellant
         worked for  longer  than  the  WHM  [working  holidaymaker]  regime
         allowed.  At least the appellant does not challenge this."

    At [26] the judge noted that, "when the appellant  was  interviewed  he
    apparently accepted that he had paid  ï¿½500  to  a  dishonest  agent  to
    extend his stay in the United Kingdom  [seeking  leave  to  remain  for
    private medical treatment]."  The judge found that, "on  the  available
    evidence ... it is clear that [the appellant] knew perfectly well  that
    what  was  submitted  amounted  to  falsehood.   He  blames  the  legal
    advisor."  At [30], the judge  noted,  "the  appellant  agreed  in  the
    interview that he had worked unlawfully.  The appellant said he  worked
    in a fabric factory."

 6. I acknowledge that the decision of Judge  Hollingworth  is,  in  parts,
    quite difficult to comprehend.  It is, however, quite apparent that, as
    Mr Mills submitted, that the judge has  reached  his  decision  on  the
    paragraph 320(11) refusal on the basis  of  previous  breaches  of  the
    conditions of his leave by  the  appellant  which  both  parties  agree
    occurred as detailed in the refusal notice.   I  agree  with  Mr  Mills
    that, in consequence, there was no need for the respondent to prove the
    facts upon which the decision was based.  The judge's failure to  state
    correctly that the burden of proof fell  on  the  respondent  did  not,
    therefore, have any material affect upon the  outcome  of  the  appeal;
    because the facts were agreed, there was, in short, no burden of  proof
    to be discharged.  As a result, I  find  that  the  appellant's  appeal
    should be dismissed, notwithstanding the judge's error of law.

 7. As regards Article 8 ECHR, it  is  not  entirely  clear  whether  Judge
    Williams (who  granted  permission  on  11  February  2015)  has  given
    permission on that ground.  At [5], he wrote

         "However there is nothing in the judge's analysis of Article  8  of
         the European Convention on Human  Rights  that  could  be  said  to
         contain errors of  law  based  on  the  judge's  findings  of  fact
         contained in the decision."

 8. Even assuming that the appellant has been granted permission on Article
    8 grounds, I do not find that the judge has erred in law in  dismissing
    the appeal.  On the basis  that  the  judge's  finding  in  respect  of
    paragraph 320(11) is sustainable, there is nothing in the circumstances
    of the appellant or his wife (the respondent does not dispute that  the
    relationship is genuine) which would outweigh the  considerable  public
    interest concerned with the exclusion of an individual who agrees  that
    he has in the past  breached  United  Kingdom  immigration  laws  in  a
    significant manner.  The judge was aware that the couple have  a  child
    who was born in October 2013 and who is a  British  citizen.   However,
    the appellant's wife was born in India and that the immediate family of
    both the appellant and his  wife  reside  there.   The  refusal  notice
    recorded that the appellant had said, "if [my wife] is  ready  to  come
    here I will stay here."  I also note that Mrs Bull  did  not  make  any
    submissions before me as regards Article  8  ECHR  and  the  First-tier
    Tribunal  Judge's  analysis.   I  can  identify  no  basis  to  justify
    interfering with the judge's conclusions.
