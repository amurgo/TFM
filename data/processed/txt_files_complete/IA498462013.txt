Representation:
For the Appellant:     In person
For the Respondent:    Mr A McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. As the appellant was unrepresented at  the  hearing  before  the  Upper
    Tribunal,  I  explained  the  nature  of  the   proceedings   to   her,
    particularly my initial task to decide whether or not the  decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge contained an error on a point of  law.  I
    assisted her to make submissions where relevant.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Ghana who appealed against  the  decision
    of the respondent on 19th November 2013 to refuse to issue a derivative
    residence card to her as the primary carer  of  her  British  child  in
    accordance with the provisions of  paragraph  15A  of  the  Immigration
    (EEA) Regulations 12006 (as amended).  That  appeal  was  dismissed  by
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal T R P Hollingworth in a decision  sent
    out on 7th July 2014.  An application to appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal
    was dismissed by a Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  on  26th  August
    2014.  However, following a renewed application to the Upper  Tribunal,
    permission was granted on 9th December 2014  by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    McGeachy.

 3. Judge McGeachy thought it arguable that Judge T R  P  Hollingworth  was
    wrong to conclude that the appellant was  not  her  daughter's  primary
    carer and that she did not qualify for leave to  remain  on  the  basis
    that her daughter's father could not care for her.

 4. In her grounds of application the appellant had asserted that  she  was
    her daughter's primary carer but had admitted to receiving benefits and
    maintenance from her daughter's father.  However, she pointed out  that
    the father is in the British Army and would therefore be unable to care
    for his daughter if the Appellant were required to leave  the  country.
    The appellant also stated that she had received confirmation  from  her
    daughter's father to prove  his  service  in  the  army  although  this
    information had not been available in a previous application.

 5. Before me the appellant confirmed that her grounds of appeal  statement
    of 8th July 2014  which  accompanied  the  application  for  leave  was
    correct and she still relied upon it.  In this she re-asserts her claim
    to be the primary carer for her daughter and  draws  attention  to  the
    evidence which was before the First-tier  Judge  which,  she  believed,
    should have led him to that conclusion.  She  concedes  that,  although
    she could go back to Ghana where her parents live with her daughter she
    would find this difficult. She would like to  take  employment  in  the
    United Kingdom and possibly to start her own childcare  business.   She
    also explains how she pays her bills although conceding  that  this  is
    with assistance from public funds and  maintenance  received  from  her
    child's father.  She acknowledges that she has not received any removal
    decision.

 6. At the hearing the appellant also expressed the view that the judge had
    not considered the letter from her GP asserting that she  is  the  main
    carer for her daughter.  She also emphasised that she did  not  believe
    the judge had fully considered her daughter's  father's  commitment  to
    the army and his own family.

 7. Mr McVeety commenced his submissions by pointing out  that  no  removal
    decision had been made against the appellant and she was free  to  make
    an Article 8 claim if she wished.  He then argued that the decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal did not show an error as there was  clearly  an
    alternative  carer  for  the  appellant's  child  even  if  there  were
    logistical problems with the father being in the army.   It  was  plain
    that the child's father did have an involvement with her.

Conclusions

 8. Neither the grounds  of  application  nor  the  permission  identify  a
    specific error in the judge's decision.  The grounds,  upon  which  the
    appellant continues to rely, amount to a re-assertion of her claims but
    no more.  The decision is comprehensive and adequately reasoned.

 9. The judge assisted the appellant to give her  evidence  after  she  had
    expressed her willingness to proceed without legal  representation  and
    the judge summarises the appellant's evidence  noting,  in  particular,
    that her child's father sees her when he can and  pays  maintenance  of
    ï¿½180 per month by direct debit.  The judge was entitled  to  reach  the
    conclusion that there was no significant challenge  to  the  conclusion
    that the child's  father  had  normal  parental  contact  and  parental
    responsibility.  In reaching that conclusion the judge commented on the
    absence of any confirmation from the father that he could  not  act  in
    the capacity of a primary carer for the child and that it had not  been
    shown that the father had abandoned his  daughter  who  had  taken  his
    surname.

10. The judge was therefore not wrong in concluding, for the cogent reasons
    given, that the appellant did not meet the requirements Regulation  15A
    of the 2006 Regulations, particularly those set  out  in  sub-paragraph
    (2) and the definition of "primary carer" set out in sub-paragraph (7).
     The judge was entitled to find that the appellant had not  shown  that
    the child's father was not in  a  position  to  care  for  her  if  the
    appellant were required to leave.  The decision  does  not,  for  these
    reasons, show an error on a point of law.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not show an error  on  a  point
of law and shall stand.
