Representation:
For the Appellant:     Miss N Parsons
For the Respondent:    Mr L Tarlow, HOPO


                          DECISION ON ERROR OF LAW

1.   The appellant has been granted permission to  appeal  the  decision  of
    First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Callender  Smith  who,   in   a   decision
    promulgated on  27  January  2017,  dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal
    against the respondent's decision to refuse  him  leave  to  remain  on
    human rights grounds.

2.   Miss Parsons relied on the grounds of appeal upon which permission  was
    granted.

3.   I found, following her submissions, that the  judge  did  err  in  law,
    such that his decision could not stand.

4.   I find that in relation  to  insurmountable  obstacles,  the  judge  at
    paragraph 40 applied the wrong test.  The judge said as follows:-

     "In terms of EX.1 and the Immigration Rules, I cannot  see  that  there
         are  insurmountable  obstacles  that  prevent  him   returning   to
         Bangladesh ... ".

5.   I agreed with Miss Parsons that this was not  the  correct  test.   The
    correct test is whether there are insurmountable  obstacles  to  family
    life continuing outside the United Kingdom, in this case Bangladesh.  I
    find that the judge's application of  the  wrong  test  amounted  to  a
    material error of law.

6.   Miss Parsons further argued that the rest of the  judge's  findings  at
    paragraph 40 were perverse and irrational.  The  judge  had  said  that
    "... given the flexibility and persistence  he  has  already  shown  in
    making his life here in the UK and the potential support  that  he  has
    both from his brother and, more generally, his parents", he  could  not
    see that there are insurmountable obstacles that prevent him  returning
    to Bangladesh.  Miss Parsons argued that this  finding  was  irrational
    because in his witness statement and oral evidence, the appellant  said
    he was unable to rely on his brother who supports his parents  and  his
    wife and  two  children.   This  means  that  the  brother  is  already
    supporting five people in Bangladesh and it is irrational for the judge
    to say that the brother would be able to  support  the  appellant,  his
    wife and two children in a home which he owns which is already crowded.
     I was not persuaded by this argument as I am  of  the  view  that  the
    judge's finding was open to him on the evidence.

7.   I find that in his application of the  balancing  exercise,  the  judge
    erred in law in finding at paragraph 54 that there  are  no  qualifying
    children in this case.  The appellant has two  children  who  are  both
    British citizens.  Evidence was provided of  their  British  passports.
    The children are aged 5 and 1ï¿½ years old. As the children  are  British
    they are qualifying children. I find that  the  judge  gave  inadequate
    consideration to the best interests of the two  British  children.   It
    was insufficient for the judge to say at paragraph 54 that there was no
    move in this appeal to remove the  wife  of  the  appellant  and  their
    children.  The judge was required to consider the best interests of the
    children and, even if there was no move in the  appeal  to  remove  his
    wife and their children, what impact his  removal  would  have  on  the
    family left behind in the UK.

8.   It appears from the decision that paragraphs 45 to 53 were part of  the
    same quotation in MA Pakistan which the judge relied  on.   Because  of
    what the judge said at paragraph 54, I find that he failed to  consider
    as part of the balancing exercise whether it was reasonable  to  expect
    the British born children and their mother to accompany  the  appellant
    to Bangladesh.  I accept that there was no  recognition  given  by  the
    judge to the fact that the children were qualifying children  and  that
    by virtue of being British nationals, enjoy the benefits that accrue to
    British nationals.  I accept that this important  area  was  completely
    overlooked by the judge.

9.   I also find that there was some confusion in the judge's decision.   At
    paragraph  46  he  said  "Applying  the  reasonableness  test"  and  at
    paragraph 50 stated "The best interests of the child".  However, I find
    that these are not considerations.  They appear to  form  part  of  the
    judge's quotation of MA Pakistan.  It appears to me  that  the  judge's
    findings on those two issues are stated  in  two  short  paragraphs  at
    paragraphs 54 and 55.  These two short  paragraphs  do  not  adequately
    deal with the issues the judge had to consider.

Notice of Decision

10.  For  the  reasons  given  above,  I  find  that  the  judge's  decision
    discloses material errors of law.  The judge's decision  cannot  stand.
    It is to be remade.

11.  The appeal is remitted to Taylor House for rehearing  by  a  First-tier
    Judge other than First-tier Tribunal Judge Callender Smith.

12.  No anonymity direction is made.
