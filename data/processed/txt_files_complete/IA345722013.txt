For the Appellant:     Mr M Diwncyz, a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms S Khan, instructed by Maz Shah Legal


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The respondent, Muhammad Tufail, was born on 14 August 1985  and  is  a
    male citizen of Pakistan.  I shall hereafter refer to the respondent as
    the appellant and  the  appellant  as  the  respondent  (as  they  were
    respectively before the First-tier Tribunal).

 2. The appellant  entered  the  United  Kingdom  on  20  January  2007  in
    possession  of  a  visit  visa.   He  overstayed  and  did  nothing  to
    regularise his immigration status.  He married his wife here on 14 July
    2009 and they have a child (ST) born in  February  2012.   On  27  June
    2013, the appellant's application to remain in the United  Kingdom  was
    refused without a right of appeal.  Subsequently, a decision to  remove
    the appellant was made on  7  August  2013  and  it  was  against  that
    decision that the appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal  (Judge
    Shimmin) which, in a determination promulgated  on  30  November  2013,
    made the following decision:

         I allow the appeal to the extent that the decision is  unlawful  as
         it does not consider the appellant's position under the Immigration
         Rules.  The respondent should consider the decision in the light of
         my findings.

         I allow the appeal under Article 8.

 3. The Secretary of State now  appeals,  with  permission,  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 4. Judge Shimmin noted [35] that  the  appellant  was  in  a  genuine  and
    subsisting parental relationship with his child  and  in  a  subsisting
    relationship with the child's mother.  She was a Pakistani  citizen  at
    the time of the appeal before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  but  she  had
    indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom.  As a consequence  of
    her "settled status" her child had been born a British citizen.

 5. Judge Shimmin recorded at [32] that the appellant's wife  has  diabetes
    and had suffered from mental health problems (depression)  for  several
    years.

 6. Although Judge Shimmin carried out a very detailed examination  of  the
    evidence, there are aspects of his determination which are problematic.
     The judge has had regard to the Immigration Rules  and  in  particular
    Appendix FM (and EX1(b)).  He identified [36] that "What is in  dispute
    is whether it would reasonable to expect the child to  leave  the  UK."
    At [49], he concluded that "taking into account all my  findings  I  am
    satisfied on the balance of probabilities that insurmountable obstacles
    do not exist to the appellant's family life with  his  wife  and  child
    continuing outside the UK."  Having made that finding, he proceeded  to
    consider Article 8 ECHR outside the Immigration  Rules.   His  analysis
    led him to allow the appeal on Article 8 grounds.  The judge considered
    that the respondent had not considered the appellant's  position  under
    the Rules.  That is not the case.  There are two immigration  decisions
    in respect of this appellant.  The first is dated 27 June 2013  and  is
    the refusal of the appellant's application for leave  to  remain.   The
    appellant had made his application six  years  after  his  leave  as  a
    visitor had expired.  As a consequence,  he  had  no  right  of  appeal
    against that decision.  The  decision,  however,  contains  a  detailed
    analysis of the appellant's position under  the  Immigration  Rules  in
    force following 9  July  2012.   As  Judge  Shimmin  had  done  in  his
    determination, the letter considers "insurmountable obstacles" and  the
    reasonableness of expecting the  British  child  to  leave  the  United
    Kingdom.  In both cases, the respondent concluded that  the  child  did
    not satisfy the Rules and, in consequence, the appellant had  no  right
    to remain as the child's father.  The appellant himself did not qualify
    under paragraph 276ADE.

 7. The second immigration decision (to remove the appellant under  Section
    10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, a decision  which  did  give
    him a right of appeal) is dated 7 August 2013.  That decision  was  not
    accompanied by a detailed consideration of the  Immigration  Rules  or,
    indeed, Article 8 ECHR outside the Rules.  The respondent has, however,
    considered the appropriate Immigration Rules,  albeit  not  a  decision
    which attracted a right of appeal.  It is not clear to us why the judge
    allowed the appeal to  the  extent  of  remitting  the  matter  to  the
    respondent to consider the appellant's position under  the  Immigration
    Rules.  It was not appropriate for him to  do  so.   Such  a  procedure
    should generally only be adopted where the  respondent  has  failed  to
    exercise a discretion which, (for example, under a policy)  because  it
    lies outside the Immigration Rules, is outside the jurisdiction of  the
    Tribunal.  The practice of remitting  decisions  to  the  Secretary  of
    State in circumstances where it was incumbent upon the Tribunal  either
    to allow or dismiss an appeal is to be deprecated.  We find, therefore,
    that Judge Shimmin erred in law.

 8. We have decided to set  aside  the  determination  and  to  remake  the
    decision.  As we have noted above,  the  decision  in  respect  of  the
    Immigration Rules is incorrect  and,  for  reasons  which  will  become
    apparent below, there was no need for the judge  to  allow  the  appeal
    under Article 8 ECHR.

 9. Judge  Shimmin  correctly  identified  the  issues  arising  under  the
    Immigration Rules, namely the existence of  "insurmountable  obstacles"
    which will prevent this family returning to Pakistan in order to  enjoy
    their life together.  There is also the question of  reasonableness  as
    regards requiring the child of the couple to leave the country  of  his
    nationality.  In her detailed skeleton argument, Ms Khan  has  set  out
    the relevant provisions of the Immigration Rules.  The respondent needs
    to show that he satisfies the requirements of R-LTRP (requirements  for
    limited leave to remain as a partner) 1.1:

    R-LTRP.1.1. The requirements to be met for limited leave to remain as a
    partner are-

     (a) the applicant and their partner must be in the UK;

     (b) the applicant must have made a valid application  for  limited  or
    indefinite leave to  remain as a partner; and either

     (c)  (i) the applicant must not fall for refusal under Section  S-LTR:
    Suitability leave to

     remain; and

     (ii) the applicant meets all of the requirements of Section E-LTRP:

    Eligibility for leave to remain as a partner; or

     (d)  (i) the applicant must not fall for refusal under Section  S-LTR:
    Suitability leave to

     remain; and (ii) the applicant meets the requirements of paragraphs E-
    LTRP.1.2-1.12. and E-  LTRP.2.1.; and

     (iii) paragraph EX.1. applies.

10. We would agree with Ms Khan that the appellant would qualify for  leave
    to remain under R-LTRP1.1(d).  The appellant would also need to satisfy
    the requirements of SLTR (suitability - leave to  remain).   We  cannot
    see  that  the  appellant  falls  to  be  refused  under  any  of   the
    requirements of SLTR:

    S-LTR.3.1. When considering whether the presence of  the  applicant  in
    the UK is not conducive to the  public  good  any  legal  or  practical
    reasons why the applicant cannot presently be removed from the UK  must
    be ignored

11. Further, we find that the appellant meets the requirements of E-LTRP1.2-
    1.12:

    E-LTRP.1.2. The applicant's partner must be-

    (a) a British Citizen in the UK;

    (b) present and settled in the UK; or

    (c) in the UK with refugee leave  or  as  a  person  with  humanitarian
    protection.




    E-LTRP.1.3. The applicant must be aged  18  or  over  at  the  date  of
    application.




    E-LTRP.1.4. The partner must  be  aged  18  or  over  at  the  date  of
    application.

    E-LTRP.1.5. The applicant and their partner  must  not  be  within  the
    prohibited degree of relationship.

    E-LTRP.1.6. The applicant and their partner must have met in person.

    E-LTRP.1.7. The relationship between the applicant  and  their  partner
    must be genuine and subsisting.

    E-LTRP.1.8. If the applicant and partner are  married  or  in  a  civil
    partnership it must be  a  valid  marriage  or  civil  partnership,  as
    specified.

    E-LTRP.1.9. Any previous relationship of the applicant or their partner
    must have broken down permanently, unless it is  a  relationship  which
    falls within paragraph 278(i) of these Rules.

    E-LTRP.1.10. The applicant  and  their  partner  must  intend  to  live
    together permanently in the UK and,  in  any  application  for  further
    leave to remain as a partner (except where the applicant is in  the  UK
    as a fianc�(e) or proposed civil partner) and in  any  application  for
    indefinite leave to remain as a partner,  the  applicant  must  provide
    evidence that, since entry clearance as a  partner  was  granted  under
    paragraph D-ECP1.1. or since the last grant of limited leave to  remain
    as a partner, the applicant and their partner have  lived  together  in
    the UK or there is good reason, consistent with a continuing  intention
    to live together permanently in the UK, for any period  in  which  they
    have not done so.

    E-LTRP.1.11. If the applicant is in the UK with leave as a fianc�(e) or
    proposed civil partner and the marriage or civil  partnership  did  not
    take place during that period of leave, there must be good  reason  why
    and evidence that it will take place within the next 6 months.

    E-LTRP.1.12.  The  applicant's  partner  cannot  be   the   applicant's
    fianc�(e) or proposed civil partner, unless the applicant  was  granted
    entry clearance as that person's fianc�(e) or proposed civil partner.




    As noted above, the appellant's partner is present and settled  in  the
    United Kingdom because she has indefinite leave to remain.

12. The appellant must satisfy  EX1  because  he  is  an  overstayer.   EX1
    provides:

    EX.1. This paragraph applies if

     (a)

     (i) the applicant has a genuine and subsisting  parental  relationship
    with a child

     who-

     (aa) is under the age of 18 years, or was under the age  of  18  years
    when

     the applicant was first granted leave on the basis that this paragraph



     applied;

     (bb) is in the UK;

     (cc) is a British Citizen or has lived in the UK continuously  for  at
    least the 7 years immediately preceding the date of application ;and

     (ii) it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave  the  UK;
    or

     (b) the applicant has a genuine and  subsisting  relationship  with  a
    partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen, settled in the UK or
    in the UK with refugee leave or  humanitarian protection, and there are
    insurmountable obstacles to family life with that   partner  continuing
    outside the UK.

13. As Judge Shimmin correctly observed, we  must  consider  whether  there
    exist "insurmountable obstacles to family life  ..  continuing  outside
    the UK."  At this point of the analysis,  we  accept  fully  Ms  Khan's
    submission that, had  Judge  Shimmin  been  properly  directed  to  the
    relevant jurisprudence, he would  not  concluded  that  there  were  no
    insurmountable obstacles in this appeal.   Of  relevance  here  is  the
    decision of the Tribunal in Ogundinu [2013] UKUT 60  in  particular  at
    [106-113]:

    106.    We finally, therefore, turn to the  requirements  of  paragraph
    399(b)(ii) of the rule; whether there are insurmountable  obstacles  to
    family life with JD continuing outside the United Kingdom.




    107.    In her refusal letter the Secretary of State fails to  pay  any
    regard to the circumstances of TS when considering this issue. TS is  a
    nine year old British citizen (and therefore a citizen of the  European
    Union). She is the daughter of JD. The fact that her mother, JD, is her
    primary carer is corroborated by Ms Best's  statement,  and  we  accept
    that this is so.




    108.    In Sanade and others (British children  -  Zambrano  -  Dereci)
    [2012] UKUT 48 (IAC) the Upper Tribunal [Blake P and UTJ Jordan]  asked
    the following question of the Secretary of State (recorded at paragraph
    93 of the decision):




    "Does the respondent agree that in a case where a  non-national  parent
    is being removed and claims it is a violation of  that  person's  human
    rights to be separated from a  child  with  whom  he  presently  enjoys
    family life as an engaged parent, that  a  consequence  of  the  CJEU's
    judgment is that it is not open to the respondent  to  submit  that  an
    interference can be avoided because it  is  reasonable  to  expect  the
    child  (and  presumably  any  other  parent/carer  who  is  not  facing
    deportation/removal) to join the appellant in the  country  of  origin?
    If not why not?"




    109.  Mr Devereux, at that time the Assistant Director UKBA and Head of
    European Operation Policy, responded as follows:




    "We do accept, however, that in a case where a third  country  national
    is unable to claim a right to reside on the basis set out above it will
    not logically be possible, when assessing the  compatibility  of  their
    removal or deportation with the ECHR to  argue  that  any  interference
    with Article 8 rights could be avoided by the family unit moving  to  a
    country which is outside of the EU".




    110.     Having  considered  the  Secretary  of  State's  response  the
    Tribunal concluded (paragraph 95):




    "This means that where the child or indeed the remaining  spouse  is  a
    British citizen and therefore a citizen of the European  Union,  it  is
    not possible to require them to relocate outside of the European  Union
    or to submit that it would be reasonable for them to do so..."




    111.    The Tribunal further clarified, when looking at the particulars
    facts of the case before it, that:




    "...as British citizens, Mrs Sanade and her children  are  citizens  of
    the European Union and as such entitled to reside  in  the  Union.  The
    respondent properly accepts that they cannot be required to  leave  the
    Union as a matter of law..."




    112.    In the case of Izuazu [2013] UKUT 45  (IAC)  the  Secretary  of
    State has confirmed that the response continues to apply, subject to  a
    clarification that it only extends to the  British  citizen  spouse  or
    partner where there is  in  addition  a  British  citizen  child.  This
    approach is consistent with the recent decisions of the Court of Appeal
    in DH (Jamaica) [2012] EWCA Civ 1736, and of  the  CJEU  in  O,  S  -v-
    Maahanmuuttovirasto [C -356/11 and 357/11: 6 December 2012].




    113.    Thus, in this appeal,  TS  cannot  be  required  to  leave  the
    European Union to join the appellant in Africa. She needs her mother in
    order to exercise her residence rights in the  Union.  To  require  her
    mother to join the appellant in Nigeria (a country with which  she  has
    no ties of any sort and has never visited) is  either  to  require  the
    child to leave the European Union, or the mother to leave the child. In
    the latter eventuality there is no evidence  of  anyone  else  able  to
    adequately care for the child and so the first issue would be reopened.
     It is certainly unreasonable to expect either TS or JD to relocate  to
    Nigeria. In our judgment the obstacles to the  mother  relocating  when
    she has to look after  her  young  child  in  the  United  Kingdom  are
    insurmountable, whatever the term means.




14. As Ms Khan submitted,  although  Ogundinu  concerns  to  a  deportation
    appeal, the wording of the  non-deportation  provisions  of  the  Rules
    (paragraph 339(ii)(b)) is identical and we accept her  submission  that
    the ratio of Ogundinu applies in  the  present  case.   In  short,  the
    respondent cannot expect a British  citizen  (i.e.  the  child  of  the
    appellant and his partner) to live outside the European  Union  and  be
    denied the benefits of its citizenship.   Not  only  do  insurmountable
    obstacles exist as a consequence, but it would also not  be  reasonable
    to expect the child to reside outside the European Union where he would
    be denied the benefits of  its  membership.   Different  considerations
    apply in deportation cases where possibility and  consequences  of  the
    separation of deportees from their family members is the focus  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  In the present  case,  it  is  not  argued  by  the
    respondent that the appellant should be separated from his partner  and
    child.

15. It follows from what we have said that the  appellant  is  entitled  to
    leave to remain under the Immigration Rules.  As a  consequence,  there
    was no need to consider the application of Article 8 ECHR  outside  the
    Rules; for that reason, Judge Shimmin's decision to allow the appeal on
    Article 8 ECHR grounds is also wrong in law.

DECISION

16. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal which was  promulgated  on
    13 November 2013 is set aside.   We  have  remade  the  decision.   The
    appellant's appeal against the  decision  of  the  respondent  dated  7
    August 2013 to remove him from the United Kingdom is allowed under  the
    Immigration Rules.

Anonymity direction maintained.
