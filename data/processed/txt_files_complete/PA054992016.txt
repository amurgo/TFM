For the Appellant:     Mr S Hyder of Reza Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms J Isherwood, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant, a citizen of  Bangladesh,  appealed  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal against the decision of the Secretary of  State  of  17th  May
    2016 to refuse her application for asylum.  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Keane dismissed the Appellant's appeal in a decision promulgated  on  4
    May 2017. The Appellant now appeals with permission  granted  by  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Plimmer on 22nd August 2017.

 2. The background to this appeal is that the Appellant entered the UK as a
    student on 21st April 2008.  She was granted further leave to remain as
    a student on a number of successive  occasions.   Her  application  for
    leave to remain on the basis of private and family life was refused  in
    June  2015  without  a  right  of  appeal.  She  submitted  a   further
    application for a Tier 2 (General) Migrant, which was refused,  and  on
    2nd December 2015 she made an application for asylum.  The basis of the
    Appellant's claim is that she is from a Buddhist Chakma community (this
    was accepted by the Secretary of  State).   She  claims  that  she  had
    written articles and blogs criticising the Government and that she  had
    come to the attention of the authorities  as  a  result  of  this.  She
    claims  to  have  been  involved  with  a  number  of  Buddhist   youth
    organisations.  She claims that the authorities came  to  her  parents'
    home and threatened her in October 2015.

 3. In dismissing the Appellant's appeal the judge took  into  account  the
    background evidence which he said "provided support for the Appellant's
    claim that she was a thorn in the flesh of the  government  during  the
    1990s and periodically after the millennium and until her blog was shut
    in 2010" [15].   The  judge  went  on  at  paragraph  16  to  say  that
    "Notwithstanding the support which the background evidence rendered the
    Appellant's claims of fact I find that she was not a  credible  witness
    and did not give a credible account of events".  The judge went  on  to
    highlight the aspects of credibility in  relation  to  the  Appellant's
    claim and dismissed the appeal on credibility grounds.

 4. In the renewed grounds to the Upper Tribunal a number of criticisms are
    made of the First-tier Tribunal Judge's decisions  and  permission  was
    granted on the basis that it was arguable that the First-tier  Tribunal
    failed to take  into  account  the  details  contained  in  the  asylum
    interview  before  drawing  adverse  inferences  in  relation  to   the
    Appellant's "propensity to elaborate".

 5. In refusing permission in the First-tier Tribunal and in the  grant  of
    permission by the Upper Tribunal both judges highlight that  there  are
    very  lengthy  findings  of  fact  and  the  grounds  contain   lengthy
    disagreements with those findings.

 6. In considering the reasons given by the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  for
    his conclusions I remind myself of the guidance given by the  Court  of
    Appeal for example in AS (Iran) v SSHD [2017] EWCA Civ 1539 where Irwin
    LJ said at paragraph 26:

         "In  approaching  criticism  of  reasons  given  by  a   First-tier
         Tribunal,  the  Respondent  correctly  reminds  us   to   avoid   a
         requirement of perfection.  As Brooke LJ observed in the course  of
         his decision in R (Iran) v The Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
         Department [2005] EWCA Civ 982, "unjustified complaints" as  to  an
         alleged failure to give adequate reasons are all too frequent.  The
         obligation on a Tribunal is to give reasons in sufficient detail to
         show the principles on which the Tribunal has acted and the reasons
         that have led to the decision.  Such reasons need not be elaborate,
         and do not need to address every argument  or  every  factor  which
         weighed in the decision.  If a Tribunal has not expressly addressed
         an argument, but if there are grounds on which the  argument  could
         properly have been rejected, it should be assumed that the Tribunal
         acted on such grounds.  It is sufficient that the critical  reasons
         to the decision are recorded.  ..."


 7. The first ground highlighted by Mr Hyder  at  the  hearing  relates  to
    paragraph 19 of the  decision  and  the  judge's  conclusion  that  the
    Appellant had elaborated on her evidence.  In particular he referred to
    the judge's assertion that the Appellant only mentioned for  the  first
    time at the hearing the assertion that the Awami League  had  collected
    and read her blogs.  He referred to questions 195 and 205 of the asylum
    interview and  paragraph  23  of  the  Appellant's  witness  statement.
    However, whilst at the interview  and  in  the  witness  statement  the
    Appellant referred to her blog being closed down Mr Hyder did not point
    me to anywhere where she said that the Awami Government  had  read  her
    blogs.  Therefore the judge was entitled to  find  that  the  Appellant
    only mentioned this for the first time at  the  hearing  and  that  her
    doing so was an embellishment  or  elaboration  of  her  account  which
    damaged her credibility.

 8. The second issue highlighted by Mr Hyder was at  paragraph  20  of  the
    judge's decision where the  judge  said  that  the  Appellant  had  not
    previously mentioned that the DGFI were the organisation which came  to
    her parents' house.  The judge concluded:-

         "From  vague  references  to  the   individuals,   from   amorphous
         references to them such as  'unknown  people'  to  reference  to  a
         specific  group  part  of  or  associated  with   the   Bangladeshi
         Government amounted in my judgment  to  extreme  elaboration  which
         damaged the Appellant's credibility".

 9. Mr Hyder pointed out that the  Appellant  had  said  in  the  screening
    interview that unknown people had come to her house but had said in the
    asylum interview that the DGFI had come to their home.

10. However, I accept Ms Isherwood's submission in relation to this  issue.
    She highlighted that in  reaching  the  finding  about  elaboration  in
    relation to the organisation alleged to have threatened her, the  judge
    was looking at the evidence in the context of the  Appellant's  overall
    claim. At Part 7 of the screening interview the Appellant  is  recorded
    as having said:-

         "I am claiming asylum today because I have  received  threats  from
         unknown people saying because of my blog and  social  connectivity.
         Because I write for minority and ethical and freedom of  expression
         I am now receiving threats from unknown people".

11. However, this Appellant had been in the UK for over 7 ï¿½  years  at  the
    time of her screening interview. She  was  not  someone  who  had  just
    arrived in the UK. Further, this Appellant was someone  who  claims  to
    have been writing a blog against the Government up until 2010  and  who
    had been politically involved and connected before that.  I accept that
    the Appellant did mention the  DGFI  at  question  191  of  her  asylum
    interview. Accordingly the judge erred in  saying  that  the  Appellant
    first mentioned the DGFI prior to the skeleton argument. However, in my
    view, in the particular circumstances  of  this  case  this  is  not  a
    material error in light of the other findings and  the  other  evidence
    and it was reasonable for the judge to draw an adverse  inference  from
    the Appellant's failure to mention the name of the organisation in  her
    screening interview.

12. Mr Hyder referred to the discrepancy in the Appellant's evidence as  to
    whether the authorities had visited her parents' home in  October  2015
    or 2016.  This is dealt with by  the  judge  at  paragraph  18  of  the
    decision where the judge highlighted that in the asylum interview (Q36)
    the Appellant referred to  people  coming  to  her  parents'  house  in
    October 2015  and  that  she  had  stated  this  also  in  her  witness
    statement, however at the hearing she initially said that they came  in
    2016 before correcting it in re-examination.  In Mr Hyder's  submission
    this is an issue which anyone could have been mistaken about  and  that
    the Appellant had corrected this in re-examination.  It is  clear  that
    the judge acknowledged that the Appellant referred to October  2015  in
    her  asylum  interview  and  that,  despite  saying  October  2016   in
    examination-in-chief, she changed it to October 2015 in re-examination.
    However the judge went on to conclude that he may have  overlooked  the
    inconsistency if the Appellant had alleged more than one incident,  but
    in light of the fact that there was only one event he could  not  [18].
    In my view it was open to the judge in light of the Appellant's overall
    evidence to conclude that an  inconsistency  in  relation  to  the  one
    significant event that she says led directly to her claiming asylum was
    a significant inconsistency which went to the core of  the  Appellant's
    credibility.

13. Mr Hyder submitted that the judge made a mistake  in  relation  to  his
    assessment of the Appellant's evidence that she  had  received  threats
    through Facebook.  He relied on pages 81 to 85 of the Appellant's First-
    tier Tribunal bundle. At paragraph 23 the  judge  correctly  identifies
    that the Appellant's Facebook status is from  12th  January  2015.   Mr
    Hyder relied  on  page  85  which  he  said  contains  threats  to  the
    Appellant, and he said that these were by way  of  a  personal  message
    rather than Facebook posts and accepted that there  were  no  dates  on
    these messages. Therefore the evidence produced does not indicate  that
    the messages were received at a time other than January 2015. In  these
    circumstances the judge's finding that the Appellant's credibility  was
    damaged by her failure to claim  asylum  until  December  2015  despite
    claiming to have received threats in January 2015 was not  based  on  a
    mistake of fact. The judge's conclusions at paragraphs 22 and 23 on the
    basis of the Facebook posts status were open to him on the basis of the
    evidence before him.

14. I agree that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  could  have  been
    more concise and focused.  However, it is my view that read overall the
    judge considered all of the relevant aspects of  the  Appellant's  case
    and gave sufficient reasons  for  rejecting  the  Appellant's  account.
    Contrary  to  the  assertion  in  the  grounds  the   judge   did   not
    misunderstand the evidence. The judge did take account of the interview
    and the statements. The grounds are  simply  a  disagreement  with  the
    findings of the judge. I find that the conclusions of  the  judge  were
    open to him on the basis of the evidence before him.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not contain a material error  of
law.

The First-tier Tribunal decision shall stand.
