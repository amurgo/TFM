Representation:

For the claimant: The sponsor Mrs Olivia N Ndoro (unrepresented)
For the respondent:    Mr S Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The claimant, Gladys Tapona, date of birth 23.11.46, is  a  citizen  of
    Zimbabwe.

 2. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Sangha promulgated on  13.8.14,  allowing,
    on human rights grounds, the claimant's appeal against the decision  of
    the respondent, dated  2.10.13,  to  refuse  her  application  made  on
    26.9.13 for entry clearance as a visitor, pursuant to paragraph  41  of
    the Immigration Rules.  The Judge heard the appeal on 18.6.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Hodgkinson granted permission  to  appeal  on
    23.9.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 30.10.14 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.



Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Sangha should be set aside.

 6. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Hodgkinson noted that the First-
    tier Tribunal Judge "appears to have concluded within his determination
    that  the  appellant  satisfies  the  requirements  of   the   relevant
    Immigration Rule, but does not explicitly say so, and has only  allowed
    the appeal on Article 8 grounds outside the  Rules."  Judge  Hodgkinson
    does not appear to have appreciated, though Judge Sangha did, that  the
    claimant had only a limited right of appeal under section  84(1)(c)  of
    the 2002 Act. There was no right of appeal on immigration grounds. That
    is why  Judge  Sangha  went  on  to  consider  article  8  outside  the
    Immigration Rules.

 7. At the outset of the hearing and after hearing submissions on the point
    I granted leave  to  Mr  Whitwell  to  amend  his  grounds  to  include
    procedural error of law.

 8. I am satisfied that there was a procedural error in this  appeal  which
    alone is sufficient to require the determination to be set  aside.  The
    appeal was listed as a floating case at Birmingham on 18.6.14.  Towards
    the end of the hearing day, this appeal had not been reached and  Judge
    Sangha made the decision to adjourn the hearing  to  be  relisted.  The
    Presenting Officer returned to her office and noted  the  file  to  say
    that she was notified at 15:55  that  the  appeal  had  been  adjourned
    without hearing. However, the sponsor pleaded  that  she  was  awaiting
    hospital treatment and that it would be difficult for her to come  back
    on another date. Judge Sangha then heard the appeal and  took  evidence
    from the sponsor, but did so in the absence of a Home Office Presenting
    Officer. There was thus no opportunity for the Secretary  of  State  to
    challenge the evidence or address the Tribunal.

 9. Further, it appears from �5 of the determination that whilst the  judge
    noted that as an out of country appeal,  the  evidence  that  could  be
    considered was limited to the circumstances appertaining to the date of
    decision, 2.10.13, the judge proceeded at  �13  and  elsewhere  in  the
    determination  to  take  into  account  evidence   of   the   sponsor's
    circumstances up to  the  date  of  the  hearing,  as  well  as  recent
    documentation and other evidence relating to the appellant's  financial
    circumstances, and the sponsor's ability to  maintain  and  accommodate
    the appellant as at the date of the appeal hearing. In doing so, I find
    that Judge Sangha took into account inadmissible evidence and thus  the
    findings  both  in   relation   to   accommodation,   maintenance   and
    proportionality under article 8 are flawed and cannot stand and must be
    set aside.

10. The remaining argument in the grounds  of  appeal  is  that  the  judge
    should not have gone on to consider article 8 outside  the  Immigration
    Rules without consideration of the Rules  in  relation  to  family  and
    private life and without applying Gulshan [2013] UKUT  00640  (IAC)  to
    the effect that the consideration outside the Rules should only be done
    if the judge has  identified  compelling  circumstances  insufficiently
    recognised in the Rules such that the decision is unjustifiably harsh.

11. There  is  little  merit  in  this  ground.  It  is  arguable  that  in
    considering the human rights claim, the judge should perhaps have first
    considered Appendix FM in relation to  family  life,  but  pursuant  to
    section 86 of the 2002 Act, the Tribunal was obliged in  any  event  to
    consider the human rights claim raised in the grounds of appeal and  to
    refuse to do so would have been a breach of article 6 ECHR. Inevitably,
    the judge was required to proceed to an article 8  assessment,  whether
    or not there were compelling or exceptional circumstances.

12. However, I find  that  the  article  8  assessment  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal was flawed in a number  of  respects,  quite  apart  from  the
    admission of inadmissible evidence  and  a  failure  to  focus  on  the
    circumstances prevailing at the date of decision.

13. I heard evidence from the sponsor, only some of which  is  relevant  to
    the circumstances prevailing at the date of decision. As no  doubt  did
    Judge Sangha, I found the sponsor, a credible and  compelling  witness.
    She was visibly distressed during her evidence and no one listening  to
    her could have anything  but  the  greatest  empathy  for  her  and  in
    particular her desire to have her mother come and  visit  her  at  this
    difficult and precarious stage of her life.

14. I understand that the appellant has made two previous family visits  to
    the UK, in 2004 and 2006/07, returing to Zimbabwe. I  accept  that  the
    sponsor has property there and that she has and  continues  to  provide
    financial support to her mother. She last visited her  mother  in  2011
    and before that visited in 2009 and returned with her mother  in  2007.
    The appellant's only other daughter passed away in 2004.

15. Summarising the rest of  the  evidence,  the  sponsor  first  began  to
    experience serious health issues in February 2013, when she suffered  a
    pulmonary embolism. Whilst undergoing treatment and investigation  into
    that matter she suffered a second embolism  and  further  investigation
    revealed a large fibroid mass in her abdomen. She  began  treatment  to
    shrink the mass, but it has not worked and she now  faces  surgery  for
    removal. I find that at the date of application, 26.9.13,  the  sponsor
    was in a serious condition and she  was  fearful  that  she  would  not
    survive. Nothing had changed by the date of  decision,  2.10.13.  There
    was no documentary evidence in support, but I  fully  accept  that  the
    sponsor was advised that given the two previous embolisms it would be a
    serious risk to fly to Zimbabwe, requiring being seated for  10  hours.
    It does not take expert evidence for me to accept  that  it  is  common
    knowledge that flying does create a risk of an embolism.  I  thus  find
    that at the date of decision there was no  likelihood  of  the  sponsor
    being able to visit her mother in Zimbabwe, both because of  the  risks
    associated to her condition and  because  she  was  in  the  course  of
    treatment for serious illness.

16. There is no doubt a strong bond between  the  appellant  and  her  only
    surviving daughter in the UK, the sponsor. Undoubtedly, given the  very
    serious medical health issues experienced the appellant wished to visit
    her daughter for moral and emotional support. I  accept  the  sponsor's
    evidence when she poignantly said that she just wanted to  be  able  to
    hold her mother's hand. Her evidence was very moving.

17. However, it is clear that the  appellant  does  not  meet  any  of  the
    Immigration Rules relating to  family  life  within  Appendix  FM.  The
    sponsor accepts this.  One  might  well  consider  that  the  sponsor's
    circumstances are  sufficiently  compelling  to  consider  whether  the
    appeal can be allowed outside the Immigration Rules under  family  life
    pursuant to article 8 ECHR.

18. Whilst in the abstract I accept that it is possible to have family life
    between a mother and daughter settled in different countries  and  thus
    apart over many years, in order to demonstrate that such family life as
    may exist between them as at 2.10.13 is sufficient to engage article  8
    they would have to demonstrate something more than the normal emotional
    ties to be expected between an adult  child  and  a  surviving  parent,
    following Kugathas v SSHD [2003] EWCA Civ 31. In that case the Court of
    Appeal said that such ties might exist if the appellant were  dependent
    on the family member or vice versa. However, neither blood ties nor the
    concern and affection that  ordinarily  go  with  them  are  enough  to
    constitute family life. "Most of us have close relations of whom we are
    extremely fond and whom we visit... from time to time; but none  of  us
    would say on those grounds that we share a family tie with them in  any
    sense capable of coming within the meaning and purpose of article 8."

19. In essence, Kugathas confined article 8 family life to situations where
    a genuine situation of mutual dependency  exists,  otherwise  the  mere
    arrival of the appellant in the UK could be exploited to create a right
    to family life preventing removal. Such dependency is  much  more  than
    the financial support which  I  accept  the  sponsor  provides  to  the
    appellant. In this case the appellant and the sponsor have lived  apart
    and engaged in separate lives for many years. Neither can it  be  said,
    despite the serious medical concerns that the appellant's  presence  is
    necessary for the benefit of the sponsor's health. It is  open  to  the
    appellant to continue to provide the sort of support I heard about from
    the sponsor, including regular telephone calls and  messages  to  check
    how the sponsor is.

20. In assessing whether there is family life sufficient to engage  article
    8, I have to separate out the current situation of  the  sponsor's  ill
    health, including as at the date of decision.  The  fact  of  her  ill-
    health, whilst engendering the greatest empathy for her situation, does
    not alter the  nature  and  degree  of  the  family  ties  between  the
    appellant and the sponsor. In the circumstances, no matter how  much  I
    may be moved by what I accept are compassionate circumstances, I cannot
    find that there is such family  life  between  the  appellant  and  the
    sponsor as to engage article 8. I do not have a residual discretion  to
    allow the appeal on compassionate grounds; that is  a  matter  for  the
    Secretary of State to consider.

21. In the circumstances, I find and Judge Sangha should  have  found  that
    there was insufficient to demonstrate that article 8 is engaged on  the
    facts of this case and  thus  the  article  8  assessment  proceeds  no
    further.

22. Perhaps had the sponsor provided  more  and  clearer  evidence  of  her
    situation, including the restriction on flying,  the  decision  of  the
    Secretary of State may have been more favourable.  However,  that  does
    not change my duty to determine the matter by applying the law  to  the
    facts of the case. I can only suggest  that  it  remains  open  to  the
    appellant to make a fresh application in which she can marshal all  the
    current evidence. It does seem to me that the  circumstances  here  are
    very compelling and call for consideration of an exercise of discretion
    outside the Rules. However, that is a matter entirely for the Secretary
    of State and this Tribunal has no power to intervene on the appellant's
    behalf. I can do no more than point out my findings as to the sponsor's
    circumstances.



Conclusion & Decision

23. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

                    I re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing it.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.




Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no award.
