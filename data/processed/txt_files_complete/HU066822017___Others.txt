                            DECISION AND REASONS



    1. These are the appeals of Isurumuni Lanchana Tamari Mendis  Wijesinghe
       Samarasekara, Upul Indrajith Joseph, and KK, citizens of  Sri  Lanka,
       against the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  of  1  June  2018
       dismissing their appeals, those appeals  themselves  brought  against
       the Respondent's refusal of their human rights claims of 24 May 2017.




    2. KK was born on 1 January 2004.  The  family  entered  the  UK  on  17
       September 2009, with Mrs Samarasekara as the principal (as I read the
       immigration history, initially as a Tier 4 student, subsequently as a
       post study worker and then as a Tier  2  sponsored  worker)  and  the
       others as her Points Based System  dependents.  They  extended  their
       leave variously until 14 December 2015, though  further  applications
       were rejected.


    3. The First-tier Tribunal accepted  the  immigration  history  set  out
       above as established, noting that KK entered the UK aged 5;  she  was
       now 14. Mrs Samarasekara had a sister in the UK to whom KK was close,
       visiting them both during the week and on weekends.  KK  was  set  to
       begin her GCSE courses in September  2018,  and  did  ballet  classes
       outside schools. She had a circle of schoolfriends. The parents could
       both speak English and Singha;
       KK could understand some Singha but principally  spoke  English.  The
       parents had family in Sri Lanka (extended family in the case  of  Mrs
       Samarasekara) and relationships with Mr Joseph's father, though  were
       estranged from  his  brother  following  a  family  dispute  over  an
       inheritance. Mrs Samarasekara had a degree in chemistry and worked in
       the care industry, in marketing; Mr Joseph worked  as  an  operations
       manager, and had qualifications in the hotel and tourism industry.


    4. The Tribunal considered that on a return to Sri  Lanka  KK  could  be
       expected to learn Singha given her family spoke the language.  Whilst
       in one sense she was at a crucial stage in her  education,  the  long
       summer break before starting her GCSEs  represented  an  interregnum;
       she could enrol in an English-speaking school in Sri Lanka,  and  any
       interruption  in  her  studies  would  not  represent  unduly   harsh
       consequences  or  insurmountable  obstacles  (terms  that  repeatedly
       describe the test applied in the decision); nor would  the  departure
       from her cousins and friends, given she could  stay  in  close  touch
       with them remotely.


    5. The First-tier Tribunal acknowledged that the expert report  deserved
       close attention, but found it  wanting.  To  the  Judge's  mind,  the
       statement that K K would probably be seriously traumatised and  would
       be unable to comprehend "any sense of justice" if required to  depart
       from the UK given she was "significantly attached to the British  way
       of life" amounted to no more than saying that she enjoyed life in the
       UK having lived her for some years and did  not  want  to  leave  the
       country.  The  author's  conclusion  that  she  would  be  unable  to
       understand what was  happening  to  her  was  inconsistent  with  his
       recognition of her as an  intelligent  young  woman.  The  First-tier
       Tribunal accepted that she might experience  some  stress  and  upset
       following her departure from the UK, but nothing untoward.  This  was
       essentially a close family unit which would remain so on a relocation
       to Sri Lanka. The immigration position of the parents was  precarious
       and there was no reason they should have anticipated remaining in the
       UK; they were well-qualified to re-integrate in Sri Lanka.


    6. Grounds of appeal argued that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal
       was unlawful for failing to take account of the statutory guidance on
       safeguarding and promoting child welfare  and  for  failing  to  give
       adequate reasons for rejecting the expert evidence, in the  light  of
       the relevant authorities.


    7. Although the First-tier Tribunal refused permission to appeal  on  28
       August 2018, permission to appeal was granted by the  Upper  Tribunal
       on 14 November 2018 on the basis that it was unclear, in the light of
       the authorities, how it was that the First-tier  Tribunal  considered
       the departure of the elder child from the UK to be reasonable.


    8. Before me Ms Anzani applied to amend the grounds of  appeal  to  take
       the point (heralded in the written varied grounds supplied before the
       hearing) that the First-tier Tribunal appeared to  have  applied  the
       wrong legal test for  assessing  the  proportionality  of  a  minor's
       removal. Mr Bramble did not object, and given that this was in fact a
       point which had struck me in my  pre-reading  as  a  Robinson-obvious
       error which the Upper Tribunal should raise  of  its  own  motion  if
       necessary, I permitted the amendment of the grounds.


    9. Mr Bramble accepted that the approach taken to the reasonableness  of
       a seven-year resident child's departure from  the  UK  represented  a
       fundamental error which affected all subsequent consideration of  the
       case, as one  could  not  know  to  what  conclusion  the  First-tier
       Tribunal might have come had it correctly directed itself.


  Findings and reasons


   10. It seems to me that Mr Bramble was right to make the concession  that
       he did. The appropriate test for a seven-year resident child looks to
       the reasonableness of their relocation abroad; it  is  in  no  way  a
       search for the higher thresholds that may  be  appropriate  where  no
       qualifying child is involved.  Here  there  are  clear  and  repeated
       references to the wrong benchmark.


   11. Relatively extensive case  law  has  fallen  from  the  oft-litigated
       scenario of parents with children. The central  provisions  in  these
       appeals are those governing the consequences for  a  family  unit  of
       significant residence in the UK by children. The Rules state:


           "Requirements to be met by an applicant for leave to  remain  on
           the grounds of private life
           276ADE (1). The requirements to be met by an applicant for leave
           to remain on the grounds of private life in the UK are  that  at
           the date of application, the applicant ...
           (iv) is under the age of 18 years and has lived continuously  in
           the  UK  for  at  least  7  years  (discounting  any  period  of
           imprisonment) and it would  not  be  reasonable  to  expect  the
           applicant to leave the UK;"


   12. Section 117B NIA 2002 provides:

           "PART 5A
           Article 8 of the ECHR: public interest considerations ...
           117B Article 8: public interest considerations applicable in all
           cases
           ...
           (6) In the case of a person who is not  liable  to  deportation,
           the public interest does not require the person's removal where-
                 (a) the person  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
                 relationship with a qualifying child, and
                 (b) it would not be reasonable  to  expect  the  child  to
                 leave the United Kingdom."


   13. The upshot of these provisions is that a child who has been  resident
       in the UK for seven years can only be  expected  to  depart  if  that
       would be reasonable in all the circumstances (Rule 276(ADE(vi)); this
       conclusion will also militate against the departure  of  any  parents
       caring for them (section 117B(6)). Elias LJ in MA  (Pakistan)  [2016]
       EWCA Civ 705 explained that wider public interest considerations  had
       to be taken into account  when  assessing  the  reasonableness  of  a
       child's relocation, beyond its best interests. The fact that a  child
       has been here for seven years must be given significant  weight  when
       carrying out  the  proportionality  exercise  as  was  shown  by  the
       Secretary of State's published guidance from August 2015 in which  it
       is expressly stated that once the seven years' residence  requirement
       is satisfied, there need to be "strong reasons" for  refusing  leave,
       because after such a period of time the  child  will  have  put  down
       roots and developed social, cultural and educational links in the  UK
       such that it is likely to  be  highly  disruptive  if  the  child  is
       required to leave the UK.  Nevertheless,  it  may  be  reasonable  to
       require the child to leave where there are good cogent reasons,  even
       if they are not compelling.


   14. Every Child Matters: Change for Children (Guidance issued in November
       2009 under section 55(3) and 55(5) of the 2009  Act)  specifies  that
       safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children requires:-

           "protecting children from maltreatment;
           preventing impairment of children's health or development (where
           health means 'physical or mental health' and development means
           'physical, intellectual, emotional, social or behavioural
           development');
           ensuring that children are growing up in circumstances
           consistent with the provision of safe and effective care; and
           undertaking that role so as to enable those children to have
           optimum life chances and to enter adulthood successfully."


   15. A parent's immigration history should not be held  against  a  child.
       Lord Hope in ZH (Tanzania) [2011] UKSC 4 at [44]:


           "The fact that the mother's immigration status was precarious
           when they were conceived may lead to a suspicion that the
           parents saw this as a way of strengthening her case for being
           allowed to remain here. But considerations of that kind cannot
           be held against the children in this assessment. It would be
           wrong in principle to devalue what was in their best interests
           by something for which they could in no way be held to be
           responsible."


   16. There has been a recent re-statement of the law  regarding  the  best
       interests of the children: KO (Nigeria) [2018] UKSC 53 �32.


      a) "in the  absence  of  clear  language  to  the  contrary  ...  the
         provisions  are  intended  to  be  consistent  with  the   general
         principles relating to the "best interests" of children, including
         the principle that "a child must not be  blamed  for  matters  for
         which he or she is not responsible,  such  as  the  conduct  of  a
         parent" �15;


      b) "it seems to me inevitably relevant in both contexts  to  consider
         where the parents, apart from the relevant provision, are expected
         to be, since it will normally be reasonable for the  child  to  be
         with them. To that extent the record of  the  parents  may  become
         indirectly material, if it leads to their ceasing to have a  right
         to remain here, and having to leave" �18;


      c) "the issue of "reasonableness" under section 117B(6)  is  focussed
         on the position of the child" �32.


   17. Seven-year resident  children  enjoy  especially  strong  protection,
       then, albeit that their existence  within  a  family  unit  does  not
       represent a trump card. Relevant factors in assessing best  interests
       include those identified by Jackson LJ  in  EV  (Philippines)  [2014]
       EWCA Civ 874 at [35] stated: "A decision as to what is  in  the  best
       interests of children will depend on a number of factors such as  (a)
       their age; (b) the length of time that they have been here;  (c)  how
       long they have been in education; (c) what stage their education  has
       reached; (d) to what extent  they  have  become  distanced  from  the
       country to which it is proposed that they return; (e)  how  renewable
       their connection with it may be; (f) to what extent  they  will  have
       linguistic, medical or other difficulties in adapting to life in that
       country; and (g)  the  extent  to  which  the  course  proposed  will
       interfere with their family life ..."


   18. The bare fact of seven years' residence is not in  itself  sufficient
       to demonstrate a lack of reasonableness  -  an  evidence-backed  case
       must be put, in order that the evaluative exercise  required  by  the
       case law of the European Convention on Human Rights is given  effect.
       In Azimi-Moayed [2013] UKUT 197 (IAC) the  President's  Tribunal  set
       out that:

           "ii) It is generally in the interests of children to have both
           stability and continuity of social and educational provision and
           the benefit of growing up in the cultural norms of the society
           to which they belong.
           iii) Lengthy residence in a country other than the state of
           origin can lead to development of social cultural and
           educational ties that it would be inappropriate to disrupt, in
           the absence of compelling reason to the contrary. What amounts
           to lengthy residence is not clear cut but past and present
           policies have identified seven years as a relevant period.
           iv) Apart from the terms of published policies and rules, the
           Tribunal notes that seven years from age four is likely to be
           more significant to a child that the first seven years of life.
           Very young children are focussed on their parents rather than
           their peers and are adaptable."


   19. Bare  assertions  that  a  change  of  school  regime  is  in  itself
       unreasonable do not suffice. The Tribunal in AM  Malawi  [2015]  UKUT
       260 (IAC):


           "39. ... Nor should the difficulties of a move from one school
           to another become unduly exaggerated. It would be highly unusual
           for a child in the UK to complete the entirety of their
           education within one school. The trauma, or excitement, of a new
           school, new classmates and new teachers is an integral part of
           growing up. In too many appeals the FtT is presented with
           arguments whose basic premise is that to change a school is to
           submit a child to a cruel and unduly harsh experience. Indeed,
           as if to illustrate the point, we note that the eldest child of
           this family has been required to move schools, and move from one
           end of the UK to the other, as a result of the decisions of her
           parents. The evidence does not suggest she suffered any hardship
           or ill effect from so doing."

   20. The upshot of the review of the authorities above is that where there
       is an evidence-backed case going to the connections that a qualifying
       child has with the UK, the Tribunal must engage in detail with  their
       best interests and weigh the reasonableness of relocation with  care.
       Where neither parent has an enduring right to remain in the  UK,  the
       qualifying' child's best interests aside, then that forms part of the
       assessment; but that consideration cannot override strong connections
       such as  those  identified  in  Azimi-Moayed  and  in  the  statutory
       guidance Every Child Matters.


   21. The approach of the First-tier  Tribunal  was  fundamentally  flawed.
       That failing goes to the very basis of its disposition of the appeal,
       and thus the appeal must be re-heard.

Decision

The appeals are allowed.
The appeals are remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for hearing afresh.
