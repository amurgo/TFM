                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr M Diwnycz, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms S Khan of Counsel instructed by Parker Rhodes
                    Hickmotts Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision  of  Judge
    Wilson made following a hearing at Bradford on 5th October 2018.

 2. Judge Wilson allowed the appellant's appeal on asylum grounds.

 3. There is no challenge to the substance of  the  judge's  decision  save
    that the Secretary of State argues that the judge was not  entitled  to
    allow the appeal under the  Refugee  Convention  since  no  reason  was
    identified in the determination covered  by  the  Convention.   It  was
    however accepted that  the  claimant  was  entitled  to  succeed  under
    Article 15(c) due to the prevailing country conditions in Iraq.

 4. Prior to the hearing the claimant's representatives served  a  Rule  24
    reply stating that the Secretary of State's application is not opposed.
    It was accepted that the claimant's risk in his home area  was  on  the
    basis of Article 15(c) of the Qualification Directive  and  not  for  a
    Refugee Convention reason.

 5. Both parties accepted therefore that the proper course was to allow the
    Secretary of State's appeal and to re-make the decision by allowing the
    appeal on humanitarian protection grounds.

Notice of Decision

 6. The original judge's decision is set aside.  It is re-made as  follows.
    The claimant's appeal is dismissed on asylum grounds.   The  claimant's
    appeal is allowed on humanitarian protection grounds.

 7. An anonymity direction is made.


Signed                              Date 19 April 2019
