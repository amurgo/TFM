For the Respondent:    Mr Tarlow,  Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1. The Appellant is a national of the Cï¿½te D'Ivoire date  of  birth  5th
       March 1976. He has permission[1] to appeal against  the  decision  of
       the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Blair) to dismiss his  appeal  against
       the Respondent's decision to refuse to issue  him  with  a  residence
       card confirming his right of residence as the family member  (spouse)
       of an EEA national exercising treaty rights in the United Kingdom.

       Background and Matters in Issue

    2. On the 18th July  2014  the  Appellant  made  an  application  for  a
       residence card. He stated that he was living in  the  United  Kingdom
       with his French wife Ms Namadogo Karamoko.

    3. The application was refused on the 19th November 2014. The Respondent
       noted that the applicant and his wife had been interviewed and  found
       there to have been a "large number of  inconsistent  and  conflicting
       answers"  given.  The  letter  sets  out  those  discrepancies.   The
       Respondent concluded that this was a  marriage  of  convenience,  and
       thus an attempted abuse of the Immigration (European  Economic  Area)
       Regulations 2006.

    4. When the appeal came before the First-tier Tribunal the Appellant and
       his wife were called to give live evidence and were extensively cross-
       examined before Judge  Blair.  He  was  not  impressed.  Although  he
       recognised that they gave consistent evidence about what had happened
       at the interview, he found there to be significant  discrepancies  in
       areas of the evidence which could not  be  described  as  peripheral.
       These related to  the  couple's  engagement  and  the  names  of  the
       Sponsor's children.  The determination also notes  omissions  in  the
       evidence which might reasonably be expected to  have  been  corrected
       had the application been genuine: Judge  Blair  considered  that  the
       lack of photographs or evidence of shared interests  or  social  life
       pointed to a lack of substance in  the  relationship.   The  Tribunal
       held that this was a marriage  of  convenience  and  the  appeal  was
       dismissed.

    5. The Appellant now appeals on the ground that the First-tier  Tribunal
       made a material misdirection in law in that it failed to have  regard
       to the lead case of Papajorgi (EEA Spouse - Marriage of  Convenience)
       Greece [2012] UKUT 00038 (IAC).

    6. The written grounds  submit  that  this  case  establishes  that  the
       "burden rests on the  Respondent  and  good  evidence  is  needed  to
       discharge it", and that "it  is  for  the  Respondent  to  prove  the
       allegation of a marriage  of  convenience".   The  Appellant  further
       complains that the matters taken against him were  "overplayed".  The
       discrepancies identified in the determination were  not,  on  a  fair
       reading, discrepancies at all.

    7. Before me Ms Vatish did not seek to amend  the  written  grounds  but
       sought to refine the point. She argued that since the full  interview
       record was not produced before the  Judge,  the  Respondent  had  not
       discharged the evidential burden upon her, and in those circumstances
       there was no obligation on the Appellant to prove that  his  marriage
       was genuine.

    8. The Secretary of State opposes the appeal on all grounds.  Mr  Tarlow
       submitted that the evidential burden was discharged  by  way  of  the
       refusal letter setting out the extensive discrepancies  arising  from
       the interview, which could not properly be described as  "peripheral"
       at all. The credibility issues were fundamental and the Appellant had
       failed to show that his marriage was genuine and subsisting.

       Error of Law

    9. Papajorgi is not authority for the propositions made in  the  written
       grounds of appeal. It does not state that the burden of  proof  rests
       on the  Respondent  and  that  it  can  only  be  discharged  by  the
       production of good evidence.   Papajorgi endorses the guidance  given
       in IS (marriages of convenience) Serbia [2008] UKAIT 31 to the effect
       that

        a) Not every applicant need prove that his marriage is not  one  of
           convenience;

        b) The need to do so only arises  where  there  are  factors  which
           support  suspicions  for  believing  the  marriage  is  one   of
           convenience. There is therefore  an  evidential  burden  on  the
           Respondent;

        c) Where the Respondent can identify such factors, it  is  for  the
           applicant to prove his case according to the normal  burden  and
           standard of proof, i.e. balance of probabilities.

   10. In this case the Respondent set out with  clarity  why  she  believed
       this to be a marriage of convenience. The  refusal  letter  sets  out
       each of the discrepancies arising from the interviews. I am satisfied
       that this was sufficient to discharge the evidential burden upon  the
       Respondent. There were reasons why she had her  suspicions,  and  she
       explained them all to the Appellant. Although it is unfortunate  that
       the  Respondent  saw  fit  not  to  produce  the   actual   interview
       transcript, it cannot be said that the Appellant was ignorant of  the
       case  against  him,  or  why  the  decision  was  reached:  cf.  Miah
       (interviewer's comments:  disclosure:  fairness)  [2014]  UKUT  00515
       (IAC).  The Respondent had discharged the evidential burden,  and  it
       was thereafter for the Appellant  to  prove  that  his  marriage  was
       genuine.  There was therefore no misdirection or error in approach by
       the First-tier Tribunal.

   11. This leads to the second of the grounds, which is whether the reasons
       given in the determination are sustainable.  Criticism is made of the
       findings that

        a) The Appellant should have  produced  more  evidence  as  to  the
           quality of the relationship;

        b) There was a difference between the description  of  the  wedding
           ring as 'white gold' and alternatively 'silver';

        c) It was incredible that the Appellant would let his  brother  buy
           an engagement ring on his behalf;

        d) That the Appellant was unable to give the correct names for  his
           stepchildren.

   12. The First-tier Tribunal has given the Appellant credit for  the  fact
       that he and the witness were able to give consistent  evidence  about
       some matters: see paragraphs 17-18. Further, some of the points  made
       in the refusal letter  are  expressly  rejected:  see  paragraph  19.
       The Tribunal was however satisfied  that  the  marriage  was  one  of
       convenience for the following reasons. Firstly, there was a  "dearth"
       of evidence. The Appellant knew what the case against him was. It was
       therefore up to him to produce what evidence he wished  to  rely  on.
       There is no error in the Tribunal taking into account the  fact  that
       evidence which one might ordinarily expect to see in such a  case  is
       absent:  paragraphs  21-23  refer.   Secondly,  those   discrepancies
       identified by the First-tier Tribunal  as  "fundamental"  did  indeed
       merit that description. The First-tier Tribunal was entitled to weigh
       against the Appellant the fact that he and his wife could not give  a
       remotely consistent account of how they came to be engaged,  or  what
       the engagement ring looked like. The  determination  recognises  that
       there is little difference in the description  of  "white  gold"  and
       "silver" [at 27]: the point made however is  that  someone  might  be
       expected to recall that the ring contained a diamond, as opposed to a
       "design on the top aspect", (not least if that person is the one  who
       presumably paid for it).   As to the matter of the children's  names,
        the Tribunal was entitled to weigh against the  Appellant  the  fact
       that he could not, when asked, give the  proper  names  for  children
       whom he claims to be his stepsons.

       Decisions

   13. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains no error of law  and
       it is upheld.

   14. I was not asked to make a direction as to anonymity and on the  facts
       I see no reason to do so.
