Representation:
For the Appellant:     In person
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the appellant against a decision of the First-tier
    Tribunal dismissing his appeal on both  immigration  and  human  rights
    grounds against the respondent's decision dated 3 June 2013 refusing to
    vary his leave to remain and to make removal directions.

Background

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh  born  on  15  June  1982.  He
    entered the UK on 14 September 2009 with  entry  clearance  as  tier  4
    general student valid until 13 April 2013. On 11 April 2013 he  applied
    for leave to remain as the spouse of a British  citizen,  his  sponsor.
    However, the respondent was not satisfied that the appellant could meet
    the income requirements as set out in  E-LTRP3.1.  He  and  his  spouse
    provided their P60 certificate which stated  they  had  jointly  earned
    �5,490.93 in their current employment but  it  failed  to  provide  any
    evidence of further earnings  from  any  previous  employment  and  the
    respondent was not satisfied  that  they  earned  the  specified  gross
    annual income of at least �18,600. The respondent went to consider  the
    provisions of para EX.1 but found there was  no  adequate  evidence  to
    show that there were no insurmountable obstacles to  family  life  with
    his partner continuing outside the UK. The applicant was also not  able
    to meet the requirements of para 276 ADE of HC395 and  accordingly  the
    application was refused.

 3. The appellant appealed against this decision arguing in substance  that
    he was able to meet the  requirements  of  the  rules  and  that  under
    article 8 it would be disproportionate to  expect  his  partner  to  go
    elsewhere to continue her family life. The grounds refer to R (Nagre) v
    Secretary of State  [2013]  EWHC  720  (Admin)  as  authority  for  the
    proposition that there had to be a consideration of article 8 and  that
    the new rules were merely a starting point. Further, it was argued that
    the sponsor and appellant had been working and  had  sufficient  income
    from their employment  and  that  the  respondent's  doubts  about  the
    availability of adequate maintenance were unreasonable.

The Hearing Before the First-tier Tribunal

 4. At the hearing of his appeal the appellant appeared in person  but  his
    representatives  had  provided  in  advance  of  the  hearing   witness
    statements  from  him  and  his  wife  together  with  some  supporting
    financial  documents.  The  judge  recorded  that  the  appellant  also
    attended with other documents belonging to himself  and  his  wife.  He
    then commented that unfortunately the documentation  produced  did  not
    provide the necessary financial evidence relating to his  gross  annual
    income or their combined gross annual income as  at  the  date  of  the
    respondent's decision nor did the receipts tie together with  the  P60s
    provided. The judge accepted that the appellant's income  had  improved
    but that was not in contemplation  at  the  date  of  the  respondent's
    decision.

 5. The appeal had been supported by a skeleton argument  provided  by  the
    solicitors which  indicated  that  at  the  date  of  the  respondent's
    decision, the appellant was unable to meet the �18,600 requirement  but
    the argument was directed to the case of MA  (2013)  EWHC  190  (Admin)
    which had challenged the vires of the financial provisions. It  was  in
    substance being submitted, so the judge commented, that in the light of
    post decision evidence there was evidence to show  that  the  appellant
    did meet at the relevant time the requirements  under  the  rules.  The
    judge found that that submission was ill founded in law  and  that  the
    correct course would be for  the  appellant  and  his  wife  to  submit
    further representations in support of an application to show they could
    now meet the requirements of the rules.

 6. The judge went on to say:

         "9. No appeal was actually pursued in relation  to  the  article  8
         ECHR grounds at the hearing and for my own part it did not seem  to
         me that if the appellant could succeed under the rules  that  there
         were any particular circumstances in the light of MF (Nigeria) 2013
         [EWCA Civ 1192] and Nagre [2013] EWHC 720 to  show  any  particular
         circumstances which were not covered by the rules.

         10. It is also as I have concluded  the  claim  could  not  succeed
         under the Rules in relation to the appellant's private life.

         11. The appeal is dismissed on immigration grounds.

         12. An appeal  on  article  8  ECHR  grounds,  if  pursued,  is  so
         unparticularised and without evidence that it is  not  possible  to
         know what is  the  claimed  private  life  or  the  effect  of  any
         interference. Accordingly  I  do  not  find  article  8  (1)  right
         engaged. The appeal on article 8 ECHR grounds is dismissed."

Grounds of Appeal

 7. In the grounds of appeal the appellant argued that the judge had failed
    to consider all the facts and circumstances of his case: he had been in
    the UK since 2009 and established  a  private  and  family  life  under
    article 8. He had been  fully  integrated  into  the  country  and  was
    involved in many social and community activities. He was a law  abiding
    citizen who had never had any trouble with the police or any authority,
    had never relied on public funds and did not want to take such  benefit
    in the future. He was self reliant and  wanted  to  contribute  to  the
    welfare of this society. His wife and many other family  and  relatives
    were present and settled in the UK and he fully depended  on  them.  He
    argued that the judge had failed properly to consider his human  rights
    under article 8.

 8. Permission to appeal was granted by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  on  the
    basis that it was arguable that the  judge  had  failed  adequately  to
    consider the appellant's human rights under article  8  and  that  that
    failure amounted to an arguable error of law.

 9. At the hearing before me the appellant through an interpreter explained
    that he had been in the UK for a long time. He had  lots  of  relatives
    and friends here. After he got married his close relations with his own
    relatives in this country continued. He also had lots of friends  here.
    He had paid his tax when working. He explained that he was involved  in
    activities working generally for the betterment of  the  community.  He
    felt that he now had nothing in his home country. He was self  reliant;
    he did not claim benefits and had no plans to do so. He explained  that
    he wanted to contribute to the welfare of  this  country  and  had  now
    absorbed its culture.

10. He accepted that his wife had originally come from Bangladesh  but  she
    was now a British citizen having been  naturalized.  He  had  lived  in
    Bangladesh until 2009. He accepted that he still  had  relatives  there
    but since he had married he had less contact with them.

11. Mr Avery submitted that the judge had not  erred  in  law  in  any  way
    affecting the outcome of his decision when considering article  8.  The
    general submission being made by the appellant was that his  article  8
    rights had not been  taken  into  account.  However,  they  had  to  be
    assessed in the light of the provisions of the rules and the  appellant
    had failed to show that he could meet those requirements  when  he  had
    made his application. Although further documents had been produced  for
    this appeal that did not affect the judge's findings and conclusions on
    the basis of the evidence before him.

Consideration of whether the First-tier Tribunal erred in law

12. Permission to appeal  has  been  granted  on  article  8  grounds.  The
    appellant's argument in essence is that proper  consideration  was  not
    given to the factors set out in  his  evidence  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and confirmed in the documentary evidence produced  both  then
    and for this appeal. The appellant has submitted a bundle of  documents
    indexed and paginated 1-81. These confirm that he, having come  to  the
    UK as a student married his wife on 7 November 2012. It is  clear  from
    her passport that whilst she was born in Sylhet, she is now  a  British
    citizen. There is no reason to believe that this marriage  is  anything
    other than genuine and the respondent has proceeded on that basis.

13. The problem for the appellant  so  far  as  the  immigration  rules  is
    concerned is that he was unable to meet the maintenance requirements as
    amended in 2012 in that he could not show an income of at least �18,600
    or that there were insurmountable obstacles to  family  life  with  his
    partner continuing outside the UK. The judge was not satisfied  on  the
    evidence before him that the appellant could meet those requirements at
    the relevant time and the fact that the appellant, assuming this to  be
    the case, has subsequently been able to meet them does  not  mean  that
    the respondent or the judge erred in law in the decisions they reached.



14. The judge dealt briefly with article 8 commenting that  in  so  far  as
    there was an appeal on article 8 grounds, it was  unparticularised  and
    lacking in and evidence that it was  not  possible  to  know  what  the
    claimed private life was or the effect of any interference. However, it
    is not so much private life that the appellant was relying  on  as  his
    family life arising from his marriage. He was also seeking to  rely  on
    the fact that he had a number of relatives present and settled  in  the
    UK, he had settled into society here  and  was  involved  in  community
    activities. He also makes the point that he is self reliant,  does  not
    claim benefits and has been law abiding.

15. However, the approach to the assessment of  a  claim  under  article  8
    based on private and family life has been significantly changed by  the
    amendments to the immigration rules in July 2012. In Singh and Khalid v
    Secretary of State (2015) EWCA Civ 74 the  Court  of  Appeal  confirmed
    that these new rules contained express provision for such applications.
    It remained the case that an applicant may seek to rely on article 8 in
    a case falling outside the provisions of the rules  but  the  intention
    was that the new rules would properly reflect its requirements  in  the
    generality of  cases  so  it  should  only  be  exceptionally  that  an
    applicant would have a valid claim  under  article  8  falling  outside
    their scope. The right course in any case where an applicant relies  on
    his or  her  family  life,  so  the  Court  held,  was  to  proceed  by
    considering first whether leave should be granted  under  the  relevant
    provisions of the new rules and only if the answer is no to  go  on  to
    consider article 8 in its "unvarnished" form.

16. The Court then referred to the line of cases including Izuazu  (article
    8- new rules) [2013] UKUT 45 and  (Nagre)  approving  the  approach  in
    Nagre  that  there  would  be  no  need  to  conduct  a  full  separate
    examination of article 8 outside the rules where in  the  circumstances
    of a  particular  case  all  the  issues  had  been  addressed  in  the
    considerations under the rules [64].

17. In his judgment in Nagre Sales J had expressed the approach as follows:

         "Nonetheless the new rules do provide better explicit  coverage  of
         the facts that are identified in case law as relevant  to  analysis
         of claims under article 8 than was formerly  the  position,  so  in
         many cases the main points in consideration to article  8  will  be
         addressed by decision makers applying the new rules. It is only if,
         after doing that, there remains an arguable case there may be  good
         grounds for granting leave to remain outside the rules by reference
         to article 8 that it would be necessary for article 8  purposes  to
         go on to consider whether there are  compelling  circumstances  not
         sufficiently recognised under the rules to  require  the  grant  of
         such leave."

18. As I have already indicated this is a case where the appellant was  not
    able to meet the requirements of the rules. Neither  the  Secretary  of
    State nor the judge was satisfied that the maintenance requirements  of
    the rules were met or that there was sufficient evidence to  show  that
    there were insurmountable obstacles  to  family  life  being  continued
    abroad. The issues which the appellant raised in  his  submissions  are
    not sufficiently compelling to raise a claim under  article  8  outside
    the rules. It is of course to the appellant's credit that  he  is  self
    reliant and wishes to be part of and contribute to society in  the  UK.
    However, none of those factors take him outside the generality of cases
    determined  in  accordance  with  the  rules  to  justify  a   separate
    assessment under article 8. The respondent's decision letter considered
    private life based on the appellant's length of  residence  in  the  UK
    but, the judge found he was unable to meet the provisions of  para  276
    ADE.

19. In summary, whilst the judge dealt briefly with article 8 the  approach
    he followed was consistent not only with MF(Nigeria) and Nagre but  has
    been confirmed by the Court of Appeal in Singh and  Khalid.  The  judge
    dealt more than adequately with the article 8 appeal.  I  am  therefore
    not satisfied that he erred in law.

Decision

20. The First-tier Tribunal did not err in law. It follows that the  appeal
    must be dismissed and the decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands.
