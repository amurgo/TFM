For the Appellant:     Ms S Naik, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

Details of appellant and basis of claim

   1.       This appeal comes before me following the grant of permission on
      20 January 2014  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Grant-Hutchinson  in
      respect of the determination of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Beg  who
      dismissed the appeal  following  a  hearing  at  Taylor  House  on  16
      December 2013 by way of a determination  promulgated  on  30  December
      2013.

   2.       The appellant is a Nigerian national born in 1961.  She  appeals
      the decision of the respondent dated 25 March 2013 to deprive  her  of
      British nationality under section 40A of the British  Nationality  Act
      1981.

   3.       The background of the case is  not  in  dispute.  The  appellant
      entered the UK on 29 November 1987 using a  false  identity.  She  was
      granted leave to enter for  six  months  but  was  then  arrested  for
      importing illegal drugs. Her leave was withdrawn and she was convicted
      and sentenced to seven years' imprisonment on  21  July  1988  with  a
      recommendation for deportation. A deportation order  was  subsequently
      signed by the Secretary of  State.  In  November  1989  the  appellant
      escaped from prison.

   4.       On 20 April 1991 the appellant claimed asylum using a  different
      name and nationality. Her claim was refused on non compliance  grounds
      on 26 February 1992.  It was then reconsidered and refused on  8  July
      1996. An appeal against refusal was dismissed on  14  September  1998;
      Although the appellant's representatives maintain that by  that  stage
      the appellant had at least come clean about her true nationality,  the
      determination of Special Adjudicator Jubber (dated 14 September  1998)
      indicates that he believed he was dealing  with  an  Ivorian  national
      although he addressed the risk of return to both the Cï¿½te d'Ivoire and
      Nigeria.  The  appellant  then  made  an  application  to  remain   on
      compassionate grounds as she was caring for the two  children  of  her
      sister who was  a  drug  user.  It  is  noted  that  this  application
      concealed her true date of entry. The application was granted and  she
      then obtained ILR on 27 March 2003. On 3 February 2006 she was granted
      British nationality.

   5.       It subsequently came to  light  in  2009  upon  her  arrest  and
      conviction when she was fingerprinted, that  the  individual  who  had
      been granted nationality and the individual who was the subject  of  a
      deportation order was one and the same. The appellant admitted she had
      made false representations  when  applying  for  nationality  and  the
      Secretary of State made a deprivation order indicating  that  had  she
      known all the facts, she would never have granted nationality  to  the
      appellant.

Appeal hearing

   6.       At the hearing before me, Mr Jarvis conceded that the First-tier
      Tribunal Judge had erred  in  law  when  considering  the  appellant's
      evidence in that she had been wrong to say  that  that  there  was  no
      evidence of the attempted suicide attempts. He acknowledged  that  the
      reports in the bundle had contained  that  information  and  that  the
      judge should have taken it into account when making her decision.

   7.       Given that concession, Ms Naik did not make any submissions save
      to say that the matter should be heard in the Upper Tribunal. She  did
      however  raise  a  fresh  point;  that  of  the  unlawfulness  of  the
      deprivation order. In response to her submissions on  that  point,  Mr
      Jarvis indicated that he would have to take instructions and that  the
      Secretary of State's position would be conveyed to the appellant prior
      to the hearing of the substantive appeal.

Findings and Conclusions

   8.       One of the reasons the judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  found
      against the appellant on Article 8 grounds was that she had failed  to
      establish that her mental health was such that her human  rights  were
      engaged.  She  relied  on  the  absence  of  documentary  evidence  to
      corroborate the appellant's  claim  of  attempted  suicide.  Given  Mr
      Jarvis' concession that such evidence had been before the judge, I  am
      obliged to find that  the  judge  erred  and  that  her  findings  and
      conclusions were tainted  by  her  error.  In  the  circumstances  the
      determination is set aside in its entirety  and  fresh  findings  will
      need to be made. For that reason it is  inappropriate  to  retain  the
      appeal in the Upper Tribunal. I note Ms Naik's submission  that  there
      are complex issues involved and for that reason I recommend  that  the
      appeal be heard by a panel of the First-tier  Tribunal  chaired  by  a
      Designated Judge. In view of the issue raised  about  the  deprivation
      order and a possible response from the  Secretary  of  State,  a  Case
      Management Review hearing may be advisable. It will be for the parties
      to liaise with the First-tier Tribunal in  that  respect  and  express
      their views as to that suggestion.

   9.       I preserve the anonymity order made by the First-tier Tribunal.

Decision

  10.       The First-tier Tribunal made an error of law.  The  decision  is
      set aside and the matter is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for  a
      fresh decision to be made by a panel chaired by a Designated Judge.


      Signed:






      Dr R Keki?
      Judge of the Upper Tribunal
