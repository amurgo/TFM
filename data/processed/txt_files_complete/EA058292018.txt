                            DECISION AND REASONS

The appellant is appealing against the decision of First-tier Tribunal
Judge Henderson promulgated on 3 September 2019.

The appellant is a citizen of Ukraine.  In 2010 he married an EEA national
(a citizen of Lithuania) and was issued with a residence card as her
spouse. They divorced in 2015.

On 22 June 2018 the appellant applied for a residence card to confirm he
was a former family member of an EEA national exercising treaty rights who
had a retained right of residence following the end of his marriage.  He
enclosed a photocopy of his former wife's passport with the application.

On 7 July 2018 the application was refused by the respondent solely on the
basis that Regulation 21(5) of the Immigration (European Economic Area)
Regulations 2016 had not been satisfied because an original valid passport
or national identity card had not been submitted.

The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal, where the appeal was
heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Henderson.  The judge dismissed the
appeal.

At the start of the hearing Ms Jones conceded that (a) the decision
contained an error on the point of law and should be set aside; and (b) the
appeal should be remade in the appellant's favour. She explained that the
respondent was making this concession because the only reason the
appellant's application had been refused was that an original identity
document for his former partner had not been submitted and in light of
Rehman (EEA Regulations 2016 specified evidence) [2019] UKUT 000195 it was
not sustainable to refuse the application on this basis.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error of
law and is set aside. I remake the decision by allowing the appeal.
