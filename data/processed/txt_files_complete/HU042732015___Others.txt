Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms S Karim (for Genga and Co Solicitors)
For the Respondent:    Mr S Staunton (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. The Appellants appeal against the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal
      of 2  December  2016  dismissing  their  appeals,  themselves  brought
      against the refusal of their human rights claims on 19 July 2015.

   2. The applications of the mother, Gifty (born 23 August 1983),  and  the
      three children ([MO] born 2008, [YO] born 2009, and [KO]  born  2014),
      had been made on the basis of the private and family  life  that  they
      had established in the UK based on long  residence  here.  The  mother
      stated that she had entered the UK in April 2003.

   3. The immigration history provided by the Respondent sets out  that  the
      mother applied for a residence card, presumably on the basis  of  some
      degree of relationship to an EEA national  exercising  Treaty  Rights,
      though that application was refused on 21 February 2010. On 26 January
      2011 an application for leave to remain outside the rules was refused.
      Further information was submitted on 30 April 2015, leading to further
      consideration  leading  to  the  refusal  letter  from   which   these
      proceedings emanate.

   4. The applications were refused. The Secretary of State did  not  accept
      that any residence in the UK was established before January 2008  when
      there was  a  record  of  the  eldest  daughter's  birth  at  Homerton
      Hospital.  As  to  routes  under  the  Rules,  Gifty  had  no   extant
      relationship with the children's father, Kofi Mensah (born 7  February
      1974), and so had no claim under the partner route; and no claim under
      the parent route because she  lacked  sole  responsibility  for  their
      care, given the role that the father was accepted as playing in  their
      lives, picking them up from school,  seeing  them  over  the  weekend,
      visiting  relatives  and  attending   church,   school   and   medical
      appointments with them. It was not accepted that she would  face  very
      significant obstacles to integration in Ghana given she had lived much
      of her life there and could be presumed to be accustomed to the  local
      culture, society and language. There were no exceptional circumstances
      present given that the children were wholly dependent on their parents
      and had no  independent  lives;  Ghana  had  a  functioning  education
      system. The close relationships that it was said the children had with
      grandfather, uncles and aunts in the UK could be maintained via modern
      means of communication.

   5. Although the parents are not in an extant relationship, Kofi  Mensah's
      appeal was joined to that of Gifty and  the  children.  He  originally
      made an application in his own right for leave on private  and  family
      life grounds, asserting that he had entered the UK in July 2002, which
      was refused because he had no  partner  in  the  UK;  his  own  parent
      application failed as the children did not live with him. He too could
      be expected to re-integrate in Ghana given he had  spent  his  earlier
      life there.

   6. The Appellants all appealed, and in  due  course  those  appeals  were
      heard by the  First-tier  Tribunal.  In  its  decision  it  begins  by
      focussing its  attention  on  the  best  interests  of  the  children,
      particularly the oldest  child  [MO],  who  it  recognised  had  lived
      continuously in the UK for 8ï¿½ years. The Judge stated "I  attach  very
      significant weight to fact that this is a young child, who  has  spent
      more than seven years of his formative life, since birth, in  the  UK.
      She would ... have put down roots and developed social,  cultural  and
      educational links ... it is likely to  be  highly  disruptive  she  is
      required to leave the UK." Both [MO] and  "to  a  degree  her  younger
      siblings, have made  significant  progress  in  their  schooling,  and
      consequently,  ...  their  removal  to  an  educational  and  cultural
      environment ... with which they are totally unfamiliar, would cause  a
      measure of disruption ... having regard to the strength of  ties  that
      they have established in the United Kingdom." Accordingly it was clear
      that their best interests were in favour of their remaining in the UK.



   7. The First-tier Tribunal did not accept that the parents had no contact
      whatsoever with any  extended  family  members  in  their  country  of
      origin; they could be  assumed  to  have  retained  their  social  and
      cultural ties there, and were in good health, and were  therefore  not
      "so incapacitated as  to  render  them  unable  to  provide  effective
      support and care for their children".

   8.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  went  on  to  consider  the  question   of
      reasonableness of the childrens' departure from the UK. It  noted  the
      need to maintain immigration control, and the fact  that  private  and
      family life was to be afforded limited weight when established in full
      knowledge of its precarious nature. It accepted that the eleven  years
      for which Kofi  had  reported  to  the  Home  Office  was  a  relevant
      consideration when assessing the weight  to  be  afforded  immigration
      control as a public interest: however, this was consistently a  period
      over which he had been content to let things lie  rather  than  pursue
      any regularisation of his status, and so deserved only little weight.

   9. The First-tier Tribunal concluded that it was necessary to balance the
      public interest considerations against the childrens' best  interests:
      "I fully recognise the significance and the weight to be  attached  to
      the fact that the minor child has spent more than seven years  [here].
      I have however come to  the  conclusion  ...  that  it  would  not  be
      unreasonable to expect the  ...  children  ...  to  leave  the  United
      Kingdom."

  10. Grounds of appeal alleged that the First-tier Tribunal  had  erred  in
      law in failing to give adequate reasons for its conclusion that public
      interest concerns outweighed the best interests of  the  children:  in
      particular, that no  powerful  reason  contraindicating  the  starting
      point that a seven-year child's residence should normally be permitted
      to continue had been identified.

  11. Permission to appeal was  granted  by  Judge  Rintoul  for  the  Upper
      Tribunal on 30 March 2017 because the appropriate approach set out  in
      Kaur [2017] UKUT 14 (IAC) had arguably not been followed.

  12. For the  Appellant  it  was  submitted  that  the  significant  weight
      identified in MA Pakistan as owed to the best interests  of  a  seven-
      year resident child had not been afforded here; and the  sins  of  the
      parents had been visited on  the  children,  inconsistently  with  the
      guidance given in Kaur. For the Respondent it was submitted  that  the
      best interests had been concisely, but  adequately,  balanced  against
      public interest considerations and the decision was one properly  open
      to the First-tier Tribunal.

Findings and reasons

  13. At the hearing before me I indicated that I  gave  my  ruling  that  a
      material error of law had been established. My reasons now follow.

  14. This is an appeal which fell  to  be  considered  wholly  outside  the
      Rules. The  Home  Office  refusal  letters,  which  are  unfortunately
      typical in their miscomprehension of the system  of  Rules  in  place,
      state that neither parent is eligible for the Appendix FM parent route
      because neither has  sole  responsibility  for  the  childrens'  care.
      However, Rule E-LTRPT.2.4 permits an  application  to  be  made  by  a
      person either with sole responsibility for the care  of  children,  or
      having direct personal access to children by agreement with the person
      whom the child normally lives with or court order. The true barrier to
      the viability of the parents' applications under the parent  route  is
      in fact that one of the parents has to be a British citizen or settled
      in the UK (E-LTRPT.2.3): and of course both are present unlawfully.

  15. [MO] is entitled to  have  her  appeal  considered  inside  the  Rules
      (276ADE(iv)) on private life grounds given she had lived in the UK for
      seven years and six months by the date of decision in July  2015.  The
      other family  members  are  all  entitled  to  put  cases  under  Rule
      276ADE(vi), if they can show very significant obstacles to integration
      abroad: this aspect of their cases would seem rather  less  promising,
      given the parents' history of living in their country  of  nationality
      for much of their lives. On a re-hearing, both [MO] and [YO] will have
      lived in the UK for more than seven years by the date of hearing,  and
      so the family will generally be entitled to rely on section 117B(6) of
      the  Nationality  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  as  there   are
      qualifying children involved.

  16. Elias LJ in MA (Pakistan) [2016] EWCA Civ 705 states as follows:

          "45. ... wider public interest considerations must be  taken  into
          account when applying the "unduly harsh" criterion. It seems to me
          that it must be equally so  with  respect  to  the  reasonableness
          criterion in section 117B(6) ... where  the  seven  year  rule  is
          satisfied, it is a factor of some  weight  leaning  in  favour  of
          leave to remain being granted

          46. Even on the approach of the Secretary of State, the fact  that
          a child has been here for seven years must  be  given  significant
          weight when carrying out the proportionality exercise. Indeed, the
          Secretary of State published guidance in August 2015 in  the  form
          of Immigration Directorate Instructions entitled "Family Life  (as
          a partner or parent) and Private Life: 10 Year Routes" in which it
          is  expressly  stated  that  once  the  seven   years'   residence
          requirement is satisfied, there need to be  "strong  reasons"  for
          refusing leave (para. 11.2.4).  These  instructions  were  not  in
          force when the cases now subject to appeal were determined, but in
          my view they merely confirm what is implicit in adopting a  policy
          of this nature. After such a period of time the  child  will  have
          put down roots and  developed  social,  cultural  and  educational
          links in the UK such that it is likely to be highly disruptive  if
          the child is required to leave the UK. That may be  less  so  when
          the children are very young because the focus of their lives  will
          be on their families, but the disruption becomes more  serious  as
          they get older. Moreover, in these cases  there  must  be  a  very
          strong expectation that the child's  best  interests  will  be  to
          remain in the UK with his parents as part of a  family  unit,  and
          that must rank as a primary consideration in  the  proportionality
          assessment. ...

          49 ... the fact that the child has been in the UK for seven  years
          would need to be given significant weight in  the  proportionality
          exercise for two related reasons: first, because of its  relevance
          to determining  the  nature  and  strength  of  the  child's  best
          interests; and second, because it establishes as a starting  point
          that leave should be granted unless there are powerful reasons  to
          the contrary.

          73 ... It may be reasonable to require the child  to  leave  where
          there are good cogent reasons, even if they are not compelling."

  17. Here, the balancing exercise is very brief: I have set it out in  full
      above. Whilst concision is often a virtue of decision making, here the
      reasoning is overly compressed. Whilst the First-tier  Tribunal  cited
      authority that recognised the weight to be given  to  a  child's  best
      interests, one cannot discern that that guidance was in fact  applied.
      There is nothing to show that the First-tier Tribunal recognised  that
      the starting point in the appeals before it was that leave should have
      been granted to the eldest child unless there were powerful reasons to
      the contrary.

  18. It is often said that matters of weight are for the  primary  decision
      maker. However, where the alleged defect goes  to  the  evaluation  of
      proportionality and lies not simply in  the  balancing  of  particular
      factors but in setting the scales in the first  place,  the  Court  of
      Appeal has repeatedly recognised that it  may  amount  to  a  material
      error of law, see for example Arden LJ in IT (Jamaica) [2016] EWCA Civ
      932 ï¿½2:

          "The tribunals in this case recognised  the  role  of  the  public
          interest  but  fell  into  error  because  they  did  not   direct
          themselves as to the weight to be given  to  it  in  balancing  it
          against the interests of the applicant and others."

  19. Furthermore, the statement that the parents were not so  incapacitated
      as to be unable to care for the children in their country of origin is
      incompatible with the test of reasonableness.  As  stated  in  PD  Sri
      Lanka [2016] UKUT 108 (IAC), the test of reasonableness poses  a  less
      exacting and demanding threshold than that posed by other  tests  such
      as those of insurmountable  obstacles,  exceptional  circumstances  or
      very compelling factors. The language used by the First-tier  Tribunal
      is more consistent with those elevated tests.

  20. There is another factor of concern here.  Disconcertingly,  from  half
      way through the  decision,  the  family's  stated  country  of  return
      mutates from Ghana to Nigeria: at paragraph 11 it is said that,  given
      that English is the official language of Nigeria, the family would not
      foreseeably experience any language barriers to their integration.  It
      seems to me that given the centrality of the country of  return  to  a
      proper assessment of  the  reasonableness  of  childrens'  relocation,
      Appellants are entitled to be confident that their cases were assessed
      by reference to the appropriate destination. This is not simply a case
      where one can  confidently  conclude  that  the  mistake  was  one  of
      inadequate proof-reading of passages originating in  a  template:  the
      references to Nigeria are multiple  and,  as  just  noted,  particular
      conclusions about circumstances in Nigeria were stated.

  21. These failings amount to material errors of law. This is not an appeal
      where there are meaningful findings upon which the Upper Tribunal  can
      build, and thus it is allowed to the extent that it is remitted to the
      First-tier Tribunal for hearing afresh.

Decision

Remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for hearing afresh.
