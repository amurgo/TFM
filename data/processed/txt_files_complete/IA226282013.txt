Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms Pal, a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Khan, EU Migration Services


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The respondent, Su Man Mon San, was born on 3 May 1990 and is a citizen
    of Myanmar (Burma).  I shall refer hereafter to Su Man Mon San as  "the
    appellant" as she  was  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  to  the
    Secretary of State as the "respondent."   The  appellant  came  to  the
    United Kingdom in August 2011 as a student.  She  made  an  application
    for further leave to remain in that capacity but this was rejected by a
    decision of the respondent dated 24 May 2013.  The  appellant  was  not
    awarded the required 30 points for Attributes because she had failed to
    provide a CIMA registration certificate in support of her  application.
    She was also found by the Secretary of  State  not  to  have  possessed
    sufficient funds (Appendix C) and her application was rejected on  that
    basis also.

 2. At the appeal before the First-tier  Tribunal  the  Presenting  Officer
    appears to have conceded that the appellant had  established  that  she
    had provided proof of her CIMA registration; at [22], the  judge  noted
    that the Presenting Officer "took  no  point  on  that  aspect  of  the
    appeal."  Earlier, at [17], the judge recorded that "in her  submission
    to this court, Ms Jones [the Presenting Officer] said that "no  further
    enquiries have been made about  [the  appellant's]  CIMA  registration,
    because she had failed the maintenance aspects of the claim.  The  Home
    Office was unaware of the Barclays account [of the  appellant]  at  the
    time."

 3. The judge appears to have accepted that the appellant did not meet  the
    maintenance requirements of the Rule on  the  basis  of  the  documents
    which she had submitted with her application.  However, at [23] he said
    this:

         Again, whilst I accept that  the  onus  was  on  the  appellant  to
         provide evidence of the fact that she  had  the  relevant  sums  of
         money - in this  case  ï¿½2,065.80  -  in  her  position  during  the
         relevant period namely from 30 March 2013 to 26 April 2013, she has
         now manifestly shown that she did have such monies available to her
         for the relevant period.  Indeed,  it  is  not  disputed  that  the
         relevant bank statements were provided by this appellant  with  her
         Notice and Grounds of  Appeal,  copies  of  which  will  have  been
         provided  to  the  Home  Office.   I  find,  therefore,  that   the
         respondent had ample opportunity to consider those matters prior to
         the hearing of this appeal, and it was open  to  the  Home  Office,
         therefore, having regard to their policy, to withdraw the  decision
         that they had made in this case.

 4. That paragraph is problematic.  The "policy" referred to appears to  be
    the so-called flexibility policy considered by the  Upper  Tribunal  in
    Rodriguez [2013] UKUT 00042 (IAC) which the judge cites at  [20].   But
    that decision of the Upper Tribunal has been reversed in the  Court  of
    Appeal in Rodriguez [2014] EWCA Civ 2.  In any event, I cannot see  how
    the flexibility policy, even if it were to  apply  in  the  appellant's
    circumstances (which it did not), could have  assisted  in  the  manner
    described by the judge at [23].   There  was  no  suggestion  that  the
    Secretary of State had any idea whatsoever at the time  she  considered
    the appellant's application that the appellant had money in a  Barclays
    bank account.  There could, therefore, have been  no  question  of  the
    Secretary of State seeking further documents or details  concerning  an
    account which she did not know existed.  Any flexibility  policy  would
    have been of no relevance whatever in those circumstances.  As for  the
    fact that the appellant may now "manifestly have  shown  that  she  did
    have monies available to her  for  the  relevant  period",  that  is  a
    finding which runs entirely contrary to the very basis of  the  points-
    based system and the provisions  of  Section  85  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration Asylum Act 2002.  I find that the judge's reasoning at [23]
    is wrong in law.  The judge should not have allowed  the  appellant  to
    include funds in her Barclays bank account in  the  assessment  of  her
    funds.  Had he excluded the money in that account,  the  appellant  was
    bound to fail in her application because she did  not  have  sufficient
    funds for the relevant period.

 5. I set aside the determination  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  have
    remade the decision.  In the light of my observations  set  out  above,
    the appeal in respect of the Immigration Rules is dismissed.

DECISION

 6. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal promulgated on 13  January
    2014 is set aside.  I have remade the decision.  The appeal in  respect
    of the Immigration Rules is dismissed.
