Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr. P Turner, of Counsel, instructed by J D Spicer  &
                    Co. Solicitors.
For the Respondent:    Mr. J McGirr, Senior Home Office Presenting  Officer.



1.    The Appellant (a national of Ethiopia, born on 13 November  1985)  has
     appealed, with permission, against the Determination of Miss C M Glenn,
     an Adjudicator, who (following a hearing on 18 September 2003 at Hatton
     Cross) dismissed his "appeal" on asylum and human  rights  against  the
     Secretary of State's decision of 22 April 2003 to refuse asylum and  to
     grant limited leave to enter the United Kingdom until 12 November  2003
     - that is, the day before the Appellant's 18th birthday.

2.    It will be noted that the  Appellant  was  granted  limited  leave  to
     enter for a period of about seven months. At the hearing before us, Mr.
     McGirr confirmed, and Mr. Turner agreed, that  the  Appellant  had  not
     been granted any earlier periods of leave. Mr. McGirr informed us  that
     the Appellant has lodged an application for  extension  of  his  leave.
     This application has not been considered by the Secretary of State yet.



3.    The Adjudicator considered the Appellant's  asylum  and  human  rights
     claims substantively. She found that his removal would not be in breach
     of the United Kingdom's obligations under the Refugee  Convention,  nor
     would it breach his protected rights under the 1950 European Convention
     for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR).

4.    The issues before us are:

      (a)   whether there is a right  of  appeal  on  asylum  grounds  under
           Section 83(2) where an applicant has been granted leave to enter
           or remain for a period of, or periods aggregating, one  year  or
           less;

      (b)   in the case of an applicant who has been granted leave to  enter
           or remain in the United Kingdom  for  any  period  (whether,  in
           aggregate, greater or less than one year), whether  there  is  a
           right of appeal on human rights grounds under Section 83(2);

      (c)   in the case of an  applicant  who  seeks  to  appeal  against  a
           decision granting him leave to enter or  remain  in  the  United
           Kingdom for any period, whether there is a right  of  appeal  on
           human rights grounds under Section 82(2).

5.    At the hearing, Mr. Turner submitted a Skeleton Argument, in which  he
     accepts that the Appellant does not have a right of appeal against  the
     Secretary of State's decision of 18 September 2003, whether  on  asylum
     or human rights grounds. Furthermore, the Appellant is not at  risk  of
     imminent removal,  and  accordingly,  his  human  rights  claim  cannot
     succeed. We agree with Mr. Turner.

6.    For the guidance of Adjudicators, we now set out our consideration  of
     the issues identified above in more detail.

7.    Section 83 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  (the
     2002 Act) is the only statutory provision  under  the  2002  Act  which
     confers on a person who has  been  refused  asylum  but  who  has  been
     granted limited leave a  right  of  appeal  to  an  Adjudicator  for  a
     determination of his or her asylum claim. Section 83 states:

            83   (1)   This section applies  where  a  person  has  made  an
     asylum claim and -

                 (a)   his claim has  been  rejected  by  the  Secretary  of
     State, but
                       (b)   he has been granted leave to  enter  or  remain
                 in the United Kingdom for a period exceeding one  year  (or
                 for periods exceeding one year in aggregate).

                 (2)   The person may appeal to an Adjudicator  against  the
             rejection of his asylum claim.


8.    Section 83(1)(b)  makes  it  very  clear  that  the  right  of  appeal
     conferred by Section 83(2) only  applies  to  a  person  who  has  been
     granted leave to enter or remain for a period exceeding  one  year,  or
     periods which, in aggregate, exceed one year.  There  is  no  right  of
     appeal under this section where the total grant  is  for  one  year  or
     less.

9.    Since the Appellant in this case was granted  leave  to  enter  for  a
     period of 7 months, he did  not  have  a  right  of  appeal  on  asylum
     grounds. The Notice of the decision dated  22  April  2003  incorrectly
     informed him that he had a right of appeal under Section 83(2). This is
     an error in the Notice of the decision. Such  an  error  cannot  confer
     jurisdiction, where none is provided for by legislation.  There  is  no
     question of any legitimate expectation arising on account  of  such  an
     error. Any right of appeal to  an  Adjudicator  must  be  conferred  by
     statue  and  cannot  be  acquired  by  arguments   as   to   legitimate
     expectation. Mr. McGirr informed us that the wrong form of  the  notice
     had been issued - i.e. the form which should have been issued  was  the
     one which would have informed the Appellant that  he  did  not  have  a
     right of appeal to an Adjudicator.

10.   Furthermore, there was no right of appeal on human rights  grounds  in
     this case either, for the following reasons:

      (1)   There was no right of  appeal  on  human  rights  grounds  under
           Section 83(2) because Section  83(2)  makes  it  clear  that  an
           appeal under Section 83 is brought "against the rejection of the
           asylum claim" - that is to say, the  substantive  issue  in  the
           appeal is limited to the asylum claim. This is reinforced by the
           provisions of Section 84(3), which states:

                 An appeal under section 83 must be brought on  the  grounds
                 that removal of the appellant from the United Kingdom would
                 breach the United Kingdom's obligations under  the  Refugee
                 Convention.

      (2)   There was no right of  appeal  on  human  rights  grounds  under
           Section 82 because the decision notice in this case  (correctly)
           identifies the decision as a  "rejection  of  asylum  claim  and
           grant of leave to enter or remain". In other words,  this  is  a
           decision to grant leave and,  for  this  reason,  it  is  not  a
           decision included in the definition of "immigration decision" in
           Section 82(1).

11.   Even if there had been a right of appeal on human rights grounds,  the
     Appellant's human rights claim could not possibly  have  succeeded.  In
     the first place, removal is not imminent,  because  he  has  lodged  an
     application for extension of his leave. The Secretary of State has  not
     considered his application yet. Until a decision is reached, it  cannot
     be said to be imminent. In the second place, it is difficult to see how
     a decision to "grant leave" could amount to  a  breach  of  a  person's
     human rights.

12.   For these reasons, the Appellant does  not,  and  never  did,  have  a
     right  of  appeal  on  asylum  grounds  or  on  human  rights  grounds.
     Accordingly, the Adjudicator did not have any jurisdiction:  There  was
     no appealable decision. The proceedings before her were a nullity.

13.   Mr. Turner was concerned at the  possibility  that  the  Secretary  of
     State may certify any subsequent asylum and human rights claims  lodged
     by the Appellant. The reason for Mr. Turner's concern is that,  if  the
     Adjudicator's  Determination  stands  as   a   determination   of   the
     Appellant's asylum and human rights claims, then  it  is  open  to  the
     Secretary of State to invoke the  one-stop  provisions  and  certify  a
     subsequent claim. Mr. McGirr undertook  on  the  Secretary  of  State's
     behalf that the Secretary of State would  not  certify  any  subsequent
     asylum and human rights claim on the basis that he or  the  Adjudicator
     had already determined it.  The proceedings before the Adjudicator were
     a nullity, with the effect that the Appellant's claim has  not  subject
     to any judicial scrutiny.  We also record here that  the  Adjudicator's
     Determination should not be used in any future proceedings as  a  first
     determination pursuant to the guidance set out in Devaseelan  *  [2002]
     UKIAT 00702, for the same reasons.

      Decision:

      The appeal is DISMISSED.
