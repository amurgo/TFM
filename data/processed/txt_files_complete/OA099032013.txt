For the Respondent:    Mr A McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   This is an appeal against a decision of a First-tier Judge  promulgated
    on 13 February 2014.  It is an appeal brought by  the  respondent,  the
    Entry Clearance Officer Islamabad against that decision.  The  original
    decision, which was made by the Entry Clearance Officer, was made on 30
    March 2013.

2.   The appellant, as I will continue to refer to  her  and  to  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer as the respondent as that was how  they  were  before
    the judge, had applied, for entry clearance as a partner under  ECP.1.1
    of Appendix FM.  The issue as it has developed is  that  of  first  the
    ability to meet the financial requirements of the Immigration Rules and
    thereafter Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

3.   The judge accepted that the couple had shown on balance that they  were
    in a genuine and subsisting marriage, which was a matter of dispute  by
    the respondent initially.  The judge went on to note that  the  correct
    documentation had not been filed with the application and therefore  it
    had not been shown that the sponsor was earning over  �18,600  and  the
    appeal therefore had to fail  under  the  Rules  but  she  went  on  to
    consider the situation under Article 8.

4.   She said at paragraph 19 having considered authorities such as  Gulshan
    and Patel that the term 'compelling' in Gulshan was saying no more than
    that consideration outside the Rules was only relevant where there were
    private and family life considerations  which  were  strong  enough  to
    reach the high Article 8 threshold and which tipped the Huang  test  on
    proportionality in favour of the appellant so as to make refusing their
    appeal a disproportionate response in all the circumstances.  She  went
    on to say that  the  appellant  and  his  spouse  could  now  meet  the
    financial threshold had they applied under the Rules.

5.   They were a genuine couple who wished to live as man and wife  and  she
    said she found their circumstances compelling, going on  to  note  that
    they did not intentionally send the wrong documents but simply  made  a
    mistake.   She  said   thereafter   that   she   therefore   considered
    proportionality, noting the interests of the economic wellbeing of  the
    United Kingdom to ensure  that  those  residing  here  could  meet  the
    financial requirements and that the need  to  comply  with  immigration
    control including meeting the Rules  and  balanced  those  matters  and
    noted what  had  been  said  by  Mr  Justice  Blake  in  MM  about  the
    appropriate level to be met.

6.   She said it was clear from the evidence before her, in  particular  the
    payslips, that the income would equate to just under �22,500 by the end
    of the tax year and considered it would be disproportionate to  require
    the appellant to apply under the Rules again or apply from  abroad  and
    allowed the appeal on the basis that it would be disproportionate to do
    otherwise

7.   The respondent sought permission to appeal  against  this  decision  on
    the basis that the judge erred in allowing the appeal under  Article  8
    because it was clear from Gulshan that the Article 8 assessment  should
    only be carried  out  when  there  were  compelling  circumstances  not
    recognised by the Rules, contrary to the judge's findings at  paragraph
    19 and  no  such  compelling  circumstances  had  been  identified  and
    reference was made also in the grounds to Mr Justice Sales' decision in
    Nagre very much to the same effect as that in Gulshan and  noting  what
    the judge said about the relevance of MM.

8.   Permission was  refused  initially  by  a  First-tier  Judge  and  then
    subsequently granted by an Upper Tribunal Judge, and I have had helpful
    submissions from Mr McVeety and Mr Haq in relation to the  question  of
    whether or not there is an error of law in this case.

9.   It is necessary I think to turn back particularly to Gulshan  and  what
    was said there since  Gulshan came after Nagre and  so  there  was  the
    opportunity to comment on that as well as other  authorities.   It  was
    said for example at paragraph 21 in Gulshan to show  that  despite  the
    absence  of  insurmountable  obstacles  to   removal,   it   would   be
    disproportionate, it would be necessary to show other non-standard  and
    particular features of the case of a  compelling  nature  demonstrating
    that removal would be unjustifiably harsh, and the judge went on to say
    that in the majority of cases where the Secretary  of  State  concluded
    that if the family member applying for leave to remain, and  of  course
    this is an entry case, not a leave to remain case,  could  not  satisfy
    the insurmountable obstacles test it was unlikely that that would be  a
    good arguable case, let alone a case ultimately found to establish that
    Article 8 would require that leave to remain should be granted  outside
    the Rules, and then at paragraph 24, the  Tribunal  drew  together  the
    principles to be derived from the relevant authorities.

10.  It was said that:

         "After applying the requirements of the Rules  only  if  there  may
         arguably be good grounds for granting leave to remain outside is it
         necessary for Article 8 purposes to go on to consider whether there
         are compelling  circumstances  not  sufficiently  recognised  under
         them",


    and  I  think  it  is  in  any  event  common  ground  that  compelling
    circumstances is the relevant test here.

11.  The judge spoke in terms of compelling circumstances in  this  case  at
    paragraph 20, which I have  quoted  from  above,  and  essentially  her
    reasoning for finding that the circumstances were compelling  was  that
    the appellant and  his  spouse  were  now  able  to  meet  the  minimum
    financial threshold.  There was evidence  that  they  met  the  English
    language requirement in the papers,  and  the  point  is  made  in  the
    grounds that this does not amount to  identifying  compelling  factors.
    The only reasons given seem to be that the  appellant  might  meet  the
    requirements  if  she  applied  now,  which  was  said  to  be  clearly
    speculative and that they  had  not  deliberately  provided  inadequate
    documents.

12.  So this is essentially a  reasons  challenge.   It  is  a  question  of
    whether the judge's reasoning in this case in finding the circumstances
    to be compelling is such as to amount to reasons  which  no  reasonable
    judge could come to on the facts of the  case  and  the  evidence,  and
    having read  the  determination  and  the  authorities  and  heard  the
    submissions I have concluded that the judge  did  err  in  finding  the
    circumstances compelling.  They are relatively standard  circumstances,
    if it is the case that the requirements of the Rules can now be met and
    I think it is right to say as the respondent does in the  grounds  that
    that is a matter of speculation and there is no reason  why  a  further
    application should not be made if the necessary income  level  is  met.
    Everything is satisfied under the Rules it  seems  and  I  can  see  no
    particular reason why on further application that would not  remain  to
    be the case but as things stand therefore I conclude that there  is  an
    error of  law  in  this  case  and  the  judge  erred  in  finding  the
    circumstances compelling.  So  her  decision  allowing  the  appeal  is
    therefore substituted by a decision dismissing it.
