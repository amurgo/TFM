Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr D Shvestha, Counsel instructed by Jein Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The Appellants, nationals of Sri Lanka, dates of birth  respectively  8
    February 1938 and 2  August  1950  appealed  against  the  Respondent's
    decisions, dated 8 September 2015, to refuse leave  to  remain.   Their
    appeals were dismissed  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Dhaliwal  (the
    Judge) on 2 November 2016.

2.   On 22 May 2017 I decided  that  the  Original  Tribunal's  decision  on
    Article 8 ECHR issues did not stand and the matter  would  have  to  be
    remade in the Upper Tribunal at a resumed hearing before  me.   Further
    evidence, if called, was to be served in advance and an interpreter was
    arranged.

3.   The position is that  there  has  been  no  material,  new  information
    forthcoming in support of this matter.

4.   The Appellants' case is  essentially  that  they  came  to  the  United
    Kingdom as visitors.  They overstayed but stayed on not  least  because
    their daughter [MP], the Sponsor, (date of birth  17  April  1976)  had
    given birth to a further child  and  by  2008  they  sought  to  remain
    essentially as carers for the children of their  daughter  and  son-in-
    law, [HP].  There are three children, [OP] (d.o.b. 2007), [HaP] (d.o.b.
    2006) and [YP] (d.o.b. 2010).  It is clear  that  the  Appellants  have
    played an active part in the upbringing of the  three  children  and  a
    part in setting a cultural background for the children.   The  Sponsor,
    her husband and all three children are British nationals.  The children
    are in full-time education in the UK.
5.      The  Appellants,  as  grandparents,  have  been  active   in   their
    grandchildren's  social  life  and  development.   They  have   another
    daughter with whom they are not in contact and they have no  particular
    connection with her and her family who are all in Australia.  They both
    say that they are very dependent on  the  Sponsor:   She  is  the  only
    source of income and provides emotional strength and assistance as well
    as a roof over the head of the Appellants.  The Second Appellant in her
    statement confirmed the relationships to which I have referred and  the
    part she and the first Appellant had  played  in  the  lives  of  their
    grandchildren, the Sponsor and the contribution that they make  to  the
    development of the children.

6.   The Second Appellant described  herself  as  very  dependent  upon  the
    Sponsor, and on the emotional support and strength the latter provides.
     The Appellants look with foreboding at  a  return  to  Sri  Lanka  and
    evidently are concerned about the extent to which they  could  continue
    to be supportive, as they have become used to doing, or  would  not  be
    supported by the Sponsor) or her husband  but  Mr  Shvestha  sought  to
    argue that that might be the case. It is clear that  that  was  not  an
    issue which the judge was invited to determine.

7.   The Appellants' daughter sets out in her statement  the  background  to
    this matter, the employment of herself and her husband  and  that  they
    all live together at a house in Luton. [MP]  owns  a  second  property,
    again a house in Luton, which generates a monthly income.  In addition,
    her husband has his remuneration as a storeman whilst she is a teaching
    assistant.  It seems self evident that they are a hard-working  family.



8.   I understand that the Sponsor was saddened by the refusal by the  judge
    and felt that the right result was that they be allowed to  remain  and
    that the grandparents, that is the Appellants, had a major  part  still
    to play in the upbringing of her children.

9.    The  Appellants'  bundle  contains  familiar  information   concerning
    employment and the Appellants' circumstances as well as photographs  of
    the family at various events.

10.  In considering this matter it is clear to me that the duty  imposed  by
    Section 55 BCIA 2009 requires that a proper and careful  assessment  be
    made of all relevant information available.

11.  In assessing this matter I look to see what  if  anything  it  is  said
    that the children's best interests are adversely as well as  positively
    affected by the involvement of the Appellants in their lives.

12.  In this case it is clear that the grandparents form an  essential  part
    of a loving bond within the family and to an extent diffuse the  impact
    on their mother and father by their daily  involvement.   It  is  clear
    that them removing to Sri Lanka will affect  the  children  and  affect
    them adversely.  There is no educational psychologist's report but I am
    provided with a letter from Dr Waidyaratne, an Associate Specialist  in
    Psychiatry.  His letter does not set out his medical qualifications  or
    the nature of his employment or practice in psychiatry.

13.  There is no information given to me as to why a proper report  has  not
    been obtained if there are concerns that the children's  education  and
    emotional advancement being significantly  adversely  affected  by  the
    Appellants' removal.  The doctor said this:

         "[MP] has informed me of the immigration appeal and  I  write  this
         letter as a family friend.


         I have known the family for over 10 years and I  met  them  at  the
         Buddhist temple based in Letchworth.  I have great  regard  for  Mr
         Enderage Don and Mrs Jayanthi Wickramarachchi and their family  who
         they  reside  with.   I  see  Mr   Enderage   Don,   Mrs   Jayanthi
         Wickramarachchi and the [P] family at least once  a  week.   It  is
         very clear to me that they are a very close bonded family which  is
         evident by their interaction with each other.  The children,  [RP],
         [OP] and [YP] are very close with their grandparents which is  nice
         to see.  I have seen them  go  to  the  grandparents  for  parental
         advice and assistance and to me Mr Enderage Don  and  Mrs  Jayanthi
         Wickramarachchi are like second parents to them.  If they  were  to
         be returned to Sri Lanka there would be  a  detrimental  effect  on
         [RP],  [OP]  and  [YP]  as  it  would  impact  on  their  emotional
         wellbeing.   Furthermore,  the   children's   education   will   be
         negatively affected and it will be a stressful experience for  them
         to adjust to such a permanent separation  from  their  grandparents
         due to high level of interaction they have with them.


         If the Court requires any further information from me,  I  am  more
         than happy to assist and I can be contacted on the above details."


14.   In  addition  he  opined  that  the  children's  education  would   be
    negatively affected and it would be a stressful experience for them  to
    adjust to such a permanent separation from their  grandparents  due  to
    the high level of interaction they  have  with  them.   Dr  Waidyaratne
    indicates his willingness to make further contact, if sought.

15.  I find the likelihood is that the children would be adversely  affected
    and upset, at least in the short term, and there is nothing  to  really
    guide me as to the extent of any permanent or long-term  damage  likely
    to be caused or to what extent that would be  mitigated  either  within
    the home or within the school or elsewhere.

16.  Given the ages of the children I have no  particular  information  from
    them concerning the impact on them as they judge it.   Nevertheless  it
    seems to me that a measure of commonsense  should be applied  and  that
    it is likely that it would be an upset for the three children.  Plainly
    there may be financial limitations on either the  costs  or  number  of
    children who would go on one  trip  or  when  it  could  occur  or  the
    frequency to go back  and  visit  the  Appellants  in  Sri  Lanka.   Mr
    Shvestha makes the point that  the  poor  immigration  history  of  the
    Appellants should not be held against the minor grandchildren and there
    is a positive contribution made  by  the  grandparents  to  enable  the
    Sponsor and he4r husband to work and support the wider family unit.

17.  It is clear that the Appellants status in the UK  has  been  precarious
    both in terms of the issues arising under Section 117B NIAA 2002 and in
    terms of the effects on family and private life rights.

18.  I consider that the maintenance of  immigration  control  is,  in  this
    case, a material consideration  which, as part of the public  interest,
    should be given significant weight.  It  is  clear  that  there  is  no
    likelihood of either of the Appellants being in work or needing to  use
    English in order to assimilate into life in the United Kingdom or  find
    employment.  Although there was reference to delay by the Secretary  of
    State the position is that  it  was  only  in  2015  that  the  present
    application to remain was made. The fact is that  delay  has  not  been
    caused  by  the  Respondent's  conduct  in  processing   the   relevant
    application and the fact that an  earlier  application,  one  the  year
    previously, had been made but which was not capable of being subject to
    appeal does not materially change the point.

19.  I therefore do not find that delay is a material  factor  which  should
    be given weight.  I take into account that telephone is  likely  to  be
    the principal means by which  the  grandparents  communicate  with  the
    children if they return to Sri Lanka.  I see no  reason  why  Skype  or
    WhatsApp cannot be used and would not effectively be available.

20.  In these circumstances this may appear to be a  hard  decision  but  it
    seems to me that there are not particular circumstances to militate  in
    favour of them remaining bearing, as I do, fully in mind their age  and
    the length of time they have been in the United Kingdom. I do not  find
    the  Appellants  have  shown  there  are  compelling   or   exceptional
    circumstances for looking at  the  Appellants  claims  outside  of  the
    immigration rules. I do not accept  that  the  Appellants  fell  within
    Appendix FM or paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules.  For  my  own
    part the Respondent's reasons, which I have  taken  into  account,  are
    persuasive.

21.  I have considered Section 117B NIAA 2002 and find that weight  but  not
    great  weight  can  be  given  to  the  private  and  the  family  life
    established  by  the  Appellants  in  the  United  Kingdom  when  their
    immigration status was precarious.  I take into account and give weight
    to the benefits to the children of the subsisting relationship with the
    Appellants  and  the  reasonable  expectations   of   their   continued
    involvement in the children's upbringing. On the evidence before me and
    on balance, in my judgment, the impact  of  their  removal  is  not  so
    significant as to outweigh the public interest in removal.

22.  Unfortunately these hard decisions are partly a  product  of  the  case
    law, which has so clearly clarified the relationship between Article  8
    ECHR and personal circumstances, but more importantly has progressively
    made it hard and harder to  succeed  under  the  Immigration  Rules  or
    Article 8 ECHR.

23.  Mr Shvestha argued for an assessment of the impact  on  the  Appellants
    but I regret to say that the evidence that has been  advanced  is  very
    thin, un-particularised. It is difficult to see why those matters  have
    been ignored or seemingly not addressed in the evidence.  A  particular
    factor which strikes me  as  significant  is  the  ages  of  the  first
    Appellant and his wife and the effect  upon  them,  at  their  ages  of
    moving away from the supportive family whose company they have  enjoyed
    for many years.

24.  In the circumstances I do find that the removal of  the  Appellants  to
    Sri Lanka is in accordance with the law and is proportionate. The  best
    interests of the children, if they were solely  determinative  of  this
    matter, would undoubtedly lead to the conclusion that the  grandparents
    should remain.  However, whilst Mr Shvestha referred to  the  interests
    of the children being paramount, he accepted that in fact  they  are  a
    primary consideration and not  that  they  were  determinative  of  the
    issues. In certain circumstances it may  be  the  children's  interests
    would have been heightened by the evidence but I do not speculate.

25.  In the circumstances in really making this  decision  I  conclude  that
    the Original Tribunal made an error of law and the  decisions  can  not
    stand.  The following decisions are substituted:

NOTICE OF DECISION
 The appeals are dismissed.

ANONYMITY
No anonymity order was requested nor was one required.

FEE AWARD
A fee of �140 for each Appellant was paid.  The appeals have failed  and  in
the circumstances I find that no fee awards are appropriate.
