Representation:
For the Appellants: Mr A Mahmood, Aman Solicitors
For the Respondent: Mr P Nath, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The first appellant was born  on  15  September  1998  and  the  second
    appellant, her brother, was born on 15 January 2003. They are therefore
    both minors. They appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  against  the
    decisions of the Secretary of State of 8 August 2014  to  refuse  their
    applications for asylum. The Secretary of State granted each  appellant
    limited leave to remain until they reach 17  ï¿½  years  old.  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge AA Wilson dismissed the appeals against the  refusal  of
    asylum and the appellants now appeal with permission to this Tribunal.

 2. The appellants claim to be undocumented Bidoon from Kuwait. Whilst  the
    respondent accepted that they are from Kuwait she did not  accept  that
    they are undocumented Bidoon. The First-tier Tribunal  Judge  dismissed
    the appeals and the grounds of appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal  contend
    that the Judge failed to consider the guidance given by the Tribunal in
    relation to Kuwait in the cases of BA [2004] UKIAT 00256, HE [2006]
    UKAIT  00051  and  NM  (documented/undocumented  Bidoon:  risk)  Kuwait
    CG [2013] UKUT 00356 (IAC). It is further  contended  that  the  Judge
    failed to give adequate reasons for his findings  that  the  appellants
    are not undocumented Bidoon and that his findings  on  this  issue  are
    unclear.

Error of Law

 3. At the outset of the determination the Judge correctly  identified  the
    issue to be determined in the appeal. At  paragraph  1  he  said;  "The
    issue  is  whether  or  not  [the  appellants]  are  children   of   an
    undocumented Bidoon and thus themselves undocumented." The  submissions
    made to the Judge by the  presenting  officer  did  not  refer  to  the
    country guidance and were to the effect that the appellants  would  not
    be at risk if they are undocumented Bidoon. The Judge went on  to  find
    that the discrimination faced by undocumented Bidoon is 'pervasive' but
    'not  life  threatening'  [17]  and  that  the  appellants  would  face
    difficulties in relation to education but that  the  account  of  their
    journey to the UK was not consistent  with  economic  deprivation  such
    that there could  be  no  prospect  of  private  education.  The  Judge
    concluded that he was not satisfied that "either Appellant was sent  to
    the UK as they were at risk  because  they  were  undocumented  Bidoon,
    their parents are alive and well and contactable in Kuwait" [18].

 4. In reaching his conclusions the Judge failed to answer the question  he
    posed at paragraph 1. Mr Nath accepted that the Judge could  have  been
    clearer in his findings on this issue  but  submitted  that  the  Judge
    found at paragraph 18 that the appellants are not undocumented  Bidoon.
    Mr Mahmood on the other hand submitted that the Judge did find that the
    appellants are undocumented Bidoon but found that they are not at  risk
    and that this conclusion is inconsistent with the country guidance.

 5. The fact that the representatives were  able  to  make  these  contrary
    submissions demonstrates that the basic findings  are  not  clear.  The
    First-tier Tribunal Judge failed to clearly state whether  he  accepted
    that the appellants are the children of an undocumented Bidoon and thus
    themselves undocumented. Had he made that finding clearly then he could
    have applied the relevant country guidance. If  the  Judge  did  accept
    that the appellants are undocumented Bidoon then he failed to apply the
    country guidance.

 6. The head note in NM summarises the Tribunals conclusions and  therefore
    the country guidance in relation to Kuwaiti Bidoon as follows;

         "(1) The distinction made in previous country guidance  in  respect
         of Kuwaiti Bidoon, between those who are documented and  those  who
         are undocumented, is maintained, but the relevant crucial document,
         from possession of which  a  range  of  benefits  depends,  is  the
         security card, rather than  the  "civil  identification  documents"
         referred to in the previous country guidance  in HE [2006]  UKAIT
         00051. To that extent the guidance in HE is amended.

         (2) The evidence relating to the documented Bidoon does not show
         them to be at real risk of persecution or breach of their protected
         human rights.

         (3) The evidence concerning the undocumented Bidoon does show them
         to face a real risk of persecution or breach of their protected
         human rights.

         (4) It must be assumed that Bidoon who did not register between
         1996 and 2000, and hence did not obtain security cards, are as a
         consequence undocumented Bidoon, though this must be seen in the
         context of the evidence that most Bidoon carry security cards."

 7. In light of the lack of a clear finding and the failure  to  apply  the
    country guidance I am satisfied that the First-tier Tribunal Judge made
    a material error of law and that the decision should be set  aside.  As
    the Judge made no findings of fact relevant to the determination of the
    relevant issue I must set aside his findings and conclusions.

Remaking the decision

 8. In considering how to approach the remaking of the decision I  bore  in
    mind that the appellants are  minors  and  have  already  had  an  oral
    hearing. The parties agreed that it was therefore appropriate for me to
    remake the  decision  based  on  the  documentary  evidence  before  me
    including the  record  of  the  oral  evidence  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal as recorded at paragraphs 3 to 11 of the determination.

 9. Mr Nath relied on the Reasons for Refusal letters dated 8 August  2014.
    He relied on the issues identified in the Reasons for  Refusal  letters
    in relation to the  credibility  of  the  account  of  the  appellants'
    father's arrest.  He accepted that if the appellants are  found  to  be
    undocumented Bidoon they are entitled to asylum in accordance with  the
    country guidance in NM.

10. Mr Mahmood submitted that the appellants' father had been issued with a
    green card in 1996 and that the evidence from the appellant's relative,
    who submitted a witness statement and gave oral evidence to the  First-
    tier Tribunal, was that the appellants' father was issued with a  green
    card in March 2000 for 6  months  but  that  it  was  not  renewed.  He
    submitted that this is the  key  evidence  because  it  is  clear  from
    paragraphs 33 and 83 of NM that those who are  unable  to  renew  green
    cards are undocumented Bidoon. He  submitted  that  this  evidence  was
    unchallenged. He therefore submitted that the appellants would  qualify
    as the children of an undocumented Bidoon. He submitted that the  birth
    certificates show that the appellants are non-Kuwaiti Bidoon.

11. I have considered all of the evidence before me.  The  first  appellant
    said in her screening interview that  she  is  a  Kuwaiti  Bidoon.  She
    repeated this claim in her asylum interview and also said that she does
    not have any documentation and that her father had been issued  with  a
    temporary identification document which is not recognised (Q33-65). She
    also said that her father works illegally buying and selling sheep  and
    that he was arrested at a demonstration and detained for  10  -14  days
    before  being  released  and  that  his  was  2  months  prior  to  the
    appellants' departure from Kuwait.  She  said  that  she  has  been  in
    contact with her parents since coming to the UK.

12. The appellants submitted birth certificates and translations. The birth
    certificates refer to the appellants' father and mother as  being  'Non
    Kuwaiti  (Bidoon)'.  The  copy  card  (and  translation)  submitted  in
    relation to the appellants' father states that it  was  issued  by  the
    Executive Committee for Illegal residents on 19 March 2000 and that  it
    expired on 18 September 2000. It states that it  confers  no  proof  of
    identity. According to the Reasons for Refusal letter (paragraph  19-20
    quoting from the Country of Origin Report 2012) such cards (referred to
    as green cards) are held only by Bidoon.

13. I have considered this documentary evidence along  with  the  interview
    records and I am satisfied that the appellants parents are  Bidoon  and
    that the appellants are therefore ethnic Bidoon.

14. The appellants' case is that they are undocumented Bidoon. The  witness
    who gave evidence in the First-tier  Tribunal  is  the  cousin  of  the
    appellants' mother. In her statement she said that she  made  enquiries
    of the appellants' father in relation to the green card  and  that  she
    had been told  that  it  was  obtained  after  the  appellants'  father
    attended the Bidoon Committee in 1996 when he was issued  with  a  card
    for one year. He then obtained the current card which was valid  for  6
    months. He said that he was not part of the 1965 census but that he and
    his father were born and raised in Kuwait. He tried to renew  the  card
    after its expiry in September 2000 but he was  told  that  he  was  not
    eligible. I  accept  that  this  is  not  evidence  directly  from  the
    appellants' father or from the appellants themselves.  However  I  take
    account of the fact that the appellants are children and may  not  have
    been able to give this amount of detail about this issue and  in  these
    circumstances it is  appropriate  for  me  to  attach  weight  to  this
    evidence. In the Reasons for Refusal letter the respondent said that if
    the appellants' father had one of these cards, which was not  available
    at the time of the  respondent's  decision  then  he  is  a  documented
    Bidoon.

15. In NM the Tribunal considered the issue of the green cards and said;

         "33.     The Bidoon committee issues Bidoon who registered  between
         1996 and 2000, a cut-off  date  set  by  ministerial  decree,  with
         security cards, which are informally known as  "green  cards".  The
         cards identify a holder with their name, address  and  birth  date,
         but it is stated on them that the card does not serve as  proof  of
         identity and that it may  be  used  only  for  specified  purposes,
         though exactly what those purposes are remains unclear. We set  out
         below situations where possession of such a  card  is  significant.
         The cards have to be renewed either yearly or once every two  years
         depending on the class of card. Some Bidoon report that they  could
         renew their cards and those of their offspring simply by presenting
         their previous cards and documents proving  their  registration  in
         the 1965 census or residence in  Kuwait  before  that  time.  Other
         Bidoon said that they had to  undergo  interviews  each  time  they
         wished to renew their cards.

         ...

         35.      It is said in the HRW report that the unregistered Bidoon,
         i.e. those who are not able to  renew  security  cards,  face  even
         greater hardships. Some unregistered Bidoon told Human Rights Watch
         that in the past they had found ways to obtain passports from other
         countries, but at some point suspected  or  discovered  that  these
         passports were counterfeit. Those Bidoon who presented  counterfeit
         passports in order to keep government  jobs  or  receive  birth  or
         marriage certificates, and later discovered  that  they  could  not
         renew these passports, found that their files  with  the  committee
         had been closed and they could  not  renew  their  committee-issued
         security cards.  They  therefore  now  remained  illegal  residents
         without even the limited protection of a security  card.  The  same
         must apply to other unregistered Bidoon  who  have  never  obtained
         security cards in the first place.

         ...

         87.      The third category consists of the unregistered Bidoon, as
         they are described in the HRW report, i.e. those who are  not  able
         to renew their security cards or people  who  have  never  obtained
         security cards. This group of people are denied  all  the  benefits
         that are available to those with security cards, as set out  above.
         Thus they cannot  obtain  passports  of  any  kind,  they  are  not
         provided with any educational funding and they are denied access to
         government clinics and hospitals altogether. Thus they are not even
         able to purchase low-cost health insurance through the  government-
         administered program. Their only recourse  is  to  seeking  medical
         services  from  expensive  private  hospitals,  which  is   clearly
         extremely problematic given their limited ability to find work."

16. The account that the appellants' father was not permitted to renew  his
    green card is therefore consistent with the background evidence and the
    findings in NM.

17. The Reasons for Refusal letter highlights some inconsistencies  in  the
    account given by the first appellant in her account in relation to  her
    father's  arrest  and  detention.  I  take  into  account   the   first
    appellant's age in considering this account. I consider the appellant's
    explanation in her witness statement that her father  told  her  mother
    about his detention in her presence. Given her age,  the  circumstances
    in which she was made aware  of  her  father's  detention  and  in  the
    context of my other findings above I am satisfied  to  the  appropriate
    standard that the appellants' father was detained as claimed.

18. In light of all my findings above I follow the country  guidance  cases
    and I find that the appellants are  the  children  of  an  undocumented
    Bidoon  father and are therefore  themselves  undocumented  Bidoon  and
    they accordingly face a real risk of persecution  or  breach  of  their
    protected human rights.

Conclusions:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of a material error on a point of law.


    I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.


    I remake the decision by allowing the appeals on asylum grounds.  As  a
    result the appellants do not require Humanitarian Protection  and  that
    ground of appeal is dismissed. The appellants' appeals on Human  Rights
    grounds under Article 3 ECHR are also allowed.
