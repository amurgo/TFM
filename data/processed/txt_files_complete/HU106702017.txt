Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr J Martin, of Counsel, instructed by Fletcher Day
Solicitors.
For the respondent:    Ms A Holmes, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a national  of  the  Republic  of  China,  born  on  2
    December 1979. She appeals, with permission, against  the  decision  of
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Lever who, following a  hearing  on  8
    March 2018, dismissed her appeal on  human  rights  grounds  against  a
    decision of the respondent  of  4  September  2017  which  refused  her
    application of 23 January 2017  for  leave  to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules on the basis of  her
    family life with her partner, Mr Hyde Lin  Tsang  Wai,  a  national  of
    China (the "sponsor").

 2. In the appellant's case,  the  minimum  income  threshold  ("MIT")  was
    �18,600. The judge had concerns as to the credibility  and  reliability
    of documents produced by the  appellant  from  her  and  her  partner's
    employer, particularly in relation to the level of income for  each  of
    them. He did not find credible  the  evidence  as  to  the  nature  and
    provenance of monies deposited into the savings accounts.  In  relation
    to EX.1 of Appendix  FM,  the  judge  did  not  find  that  there  were
    insurmountable obstacles to family life being continued in Hong Kong.

 3. At the  hearing  before  me,  Ms  Holmes  agreed  that  the  judge  had
    materially erred in law in his consideration of whether the documentary
    evidence satisfied the MIT. In particular, she  accepted  that  he  had
    overlooked relevant evidence. She therefore agreed that  I  should  set
    aside the judge's decision and proceed to re-make the decision  on  the
    appellant's appeal against the respondent's decision. I agreed.

 4. I therefore proceeded  to  re-make  the  decision  on  the  appellant's
    appeal.

 5. In this regard, Mr Martin and Ms Holmes agreed that:

      i)    the appellant and  the  sponsor  had  a  combined  income  of  �
17,889.07;

      ii)   this meant that the  shortfall  in  their  income  was  about  �
800.00; and

      iii)  they would therefore need to show that they had savings  in  the
        minimum amount of � 19,200, this being the aggregate  of  �  16,000
        and a sum (i.e. � 3,200) which is equivalent to two and half  times
        the shortfall of � 800.00.

 6. Ms Holmes agreed that the total amount of savings  in  the  appellant's
    Santander accounts (there were two such accounts) was in  excess  of  �
    24,000. Accordingly, Ms Holmes agreed that the appellant satisfied  the
    MIT. She therefore asked me to allow the appeal.

 7. Mr Martin and Ms Holmes agreed that the appeal  should  be  allowed  on
    human rights grounds.

8.    For the reasons given above, I am satisfied that the appellant
    satisfies the MIT. I therefore allow the appeal on human rights
    grounds.

      Decision

    The decision of Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  Lever  involved  the
    making of an error of law sufficient to require it to be set aside. The
    decision was set aside. The Upper Tribunal has re-made the decision  on
    the appellant's appeal against the Secretary of State's  decision.  The
    appeal is allowed on human rights grounds.
