For the Appellant:     Ms Khan, Counsel instructed by Fountain Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Harrison, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

     1.  The  Appellant  is  a  national  of  Vietnam.   He   appeals   with
        permission[1] the decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge  Lloyd-
        Smith)[2] to dismiss his appeal, on asylum and human rights grounds,
        against a decision to remove him from the United Kingdom  under  s10
        of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.

     2. The Appellant claimed asylum approximately three  months  after  his
        arrival in this country on the 1st May 2013. The basis of his  claim
        was that he had a well-founded fear of persecution  in  Vietnam  for
        reasons of his political opinion, viz membership of  a  banned  pro-
        democracy  group.   His  human  rights  claim  was  based   on   his
        relationship with a Vietnamese national with refugee status whom  he
        had known prior to his arrival in the UK. After they met in  the  UK
        she had become pregnant and they had got married  in  a  traditional
        ceremony.

     3. The First-tier Tribunal did not believe the Appellant's  account  of
        political involvement in Vietnam.  A number  of  inconsistencies  in
        his evidence are identified, set out at paragraph 41(a)-(k)  of  the
        determination. In respect of his claimed family life the  First-tier
        Tribunal did not accept that they were in a relationship before  she
        left Vietnam for the UK, since the  Appellant  had,  upon  claiming,
        described himself as single instead  of  attaching  himself  to  the
        claim of a recognised refugee, as one might have expected.  The live
        evidence of the Appellant and his claimed partner was unsatisfactory
        and contradictory to the extent  that  the  Tribunal  could  not  be
        satisfied that the baby was even his.   Judge  Lloyd-Smith  was  not
        satisfied that the Appellant had a family life and for  that  reason
        found no breach of Article 8.

     4. The grounds of appeal are that the First-tier Tribunal erred in  the
        following material respects:

         i) Inadequate reasoning  in  respect  of  the  Refugee  Convention
            grounds;

        ii) Failure to consider whether the Appellant would be at  risk  on
            return because of his own anti-government views or those of his
            wife: RT (Zimbabwe) and Ors v SSHD [2012] UKSC 38;

       iii) Failure to consider relevant evidence in reaching a decision on
            whether there was a family life

   Error of Law

     5. The Appellant has shown there to be a material error in the approach
        taken to Article 8 in this determination. There was a good  deal  of
        evidence produced as to the Appellant's relationship that  does  not
        feature in the Tribunal's reasoning. There was for instance a bundle
        of wedding photographs, statements and letters written in support by
        third parties, a receipt from a jeweller said to relate to the ring,
        and the evidence of a witness who gave live evidence.  The  findings
        do not mention any of that evidence. The reasoning appears in  large
        part to turn on the Appellant's failure to declare his  relationship
        in his SEF. The Appellant's argument before the First-tier  Tribunal
        was that the SEF simply did not give him the right box to tick;  the
        only options were "single, married, widowed,  separated,  divorced".
        He submitted that having found no option to indicate that he was "in
        a relationship" he simply ticked "single". No consideration has been
        given to that explanation for a matter which  clearly  troubled  the
        Tribunal.   For that reason  I  am  satisfied  that  the  Article  8
        findings must be set aside and remade.

     6. As to the remaining grounds  I  am  satisfied  that  the  First-tier
        Tribunal did not err in its approach to the question of whether  the
        Appellant's account of events in Vietnam was true. The determination
        gives numerous sound reasons for rejecting the  Appellant's  account
        of involvement with a pro-democracy group.  It may be  that  one  or
        more of the reasons set out at (a) to (k) of paragraph 41  are  open
        to criticism but taken together the Tribunal was entitled  to  find,
        on the evidence before it, that the Appellant had not discharged the
        burden of proof, even to the lower standard. Judge Appleyard's found
        the reasoning was not in any way inadequate, and he was quite right.
        The reasoning is clear and soundly based on the evidence.

     7. If  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  correct  to  have  rejected  the
        Appellant's claims to be a  political  opponent  of  the  Vietnamese
        government the RT point is limited to whether the Appellant  can  be
        expected to lie about his  claimed  association  with  a  recognised
        refugee.  This point does not appear to have any merit at  all.  The
        skeleton argument relied upon before the First-tier  Tribunal  makes
        no mention of this issue. Judge Lloyd-Smith can hardly be  at  fault
        for failing to deal with a submission that was not made. Nor  was  I
        directed to any country background  material  which  might  indicate
        that the Appellant would be asked anything at all  on  return,  much
        less anything about his partner; I could not find  any  evidence  to
        that effect in the massive bundle that was placed before the  First-
        tier Tribunal.  There was no error in law in failing  to  address  a
        submission that was not made which in any event would  have  had  no
        evidential support.

     8. It is further submitted that the determination contains  a  material
        omission in that there is no analysis of whether the Appellant would
        be at risk in Vietnam as a result of some political opinion  imputed
        to him by association with his  claimed  partner.   I  can  find  no
        evidence at all to suggest that the Appellant's claimed partner  was
        granted refugee status as a result of a political issue, nor have  I
        been able to find any material which might support a claim  that  he
        would be at risk as a result. There is no error in the determination
        in this respect.

     9. The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  is  therefore  upheld  in
        respect of the protection claim, but set aside insofar as it relates
        to Article 8.

   Re-Making the Article 8 Decision

    10. I heard oral evidence from the Appellant and from his wife,  a  full
        transcript of which can be found in the Record of Proceedings. I was
        referred to the bundle of documents that had been before the  First-
        tier  Tribunal,  in  particular  the  witness  statements  and   the
        documentary evidence referred to at paragraph 5 above. The Appellant
        applied, and was granted leave, to submit further  evidence  in  the
        form of a DNA report confirming that he is the father of Yen Hai Thi
        Hoang's baby.

    11. The parties agreed that the appropriate legal framework was first to
        determine whether the Appellant  could  meet  the  requirements  for
        leave to remain as a partner under Appendix FM,  then  if  he  could
        not, consider Article 8 outside  the  Rules.   Ms  Khan  immediately
        conceded that at the date of the appeal,  the  Appellant  could  not
        meet the requirements under FM, since he and his  partner  have  not
        been cohabiting long enough to meet the definition of  'partner'  at
        GEN.1.2.  I was however asked to make findings on the  rest  of  the
        relevant requirements under FM; that is because come  September  the
        Appellant will have been cohabiting with his partner for 2 years and
        will therefore be eligible to apply as her partner.

    12. I find as follows.

    13. It is easy to understand why Judge Lloyd-Smith was so unimpressed by
        the Appellant's evidence. Although he was able to speak  confidently
        about his daughter and his current relationship with his partner  he
        struggled to give basic details about her life in  Vietnam:  he  was
        not, for instance, able to say whether she had ever  been  detained,
        despite claiming to have been in a relationship with her since 2006.
          There was a fundamental contradiction in the oral evidence in that
        the Appellant claimed that he had spoken to his  partner  before  he
        left Vietnam, it was she who had asked him to come to the UK and she
        knew that he was coming. Ms Hoang, on  the  other  hand,  repeatedly
        told Mr Harrison that she had no idea that he was coming and that it
        was a "big surprise" when she walked into her friend's home and  saw
        him there.  Those difficulties aside, the  core  of  the  Article  8
        claim is accepted. The baby is the Appellant's, and I accept, as did
        Mr Harrison, that the three of them are currently sharing  a  family
        life. There were numerous photographs of the three of them together,
        and of the Appellant with  his  daughter.   Ms  Hoang  is  currently
        working as a nail technician in her own salon. She has a turnover of
        approximately �20,000 per annum and takes home between �200 and �300
        per week. The Appellant looks after their child when she is working.
         I accept that there is a family life and that if the Appellant were
        to be removed there would be an interference with it: Article  8  is
        engaged.

    14. The removal of persons who have no leave to remain under  the  Rules
        is rationally connected to the  legitimate  aim  of  protecting  the
        economy, and it is a decision that the Secretary of State was in law
        entitled to take. The question is whether it is proportionate.

    15. The Appellant is currently looking after the baby whilst his wife is
        at work. She is the sole breadwinner and is running  her  own,  very
        recently opened, business. If the Appellant were to be  removed  she
        would have to find alternative childcare,  and  in  the  worse  case
        scenario, give up work.   She is not currently earning  enough  from
        the business to be able  to  meet  the  financial  requirements  for
        maintenance under Appendix FM. If the Appellant were  to  return  to
        Vietnam in order to apply for entry  clearance  it  is  likely  that
        there would be a substantial delay in him being able to  rejoin  his
        family. That is because he would need to wait  until  his  wife  was
        earning enough money, no mean feat for a single  mother.  Those  are
        the requirements of the Rules, and in many  cases  the  interference
        arising from a failure to meet them will be entirely  justified  and
        proportionate.    Certainly  there  would  be  sound  public  policy
        reasons to remove this Appellant. He entered illegally, made an ill-
        founded asylum claim and has no current leave.   With  reference  to
        the public interest considerations  in  s117B  of  the  Nationality,
        Immigration and Asylum Act 2014 (as amended)  his  case  has  little
        prospect of success.

    16. There are however two features of this case which lead  me  to  find
        otherwise. The first is that the  Appellant's  wife  has  only  very
        recently  been  recognised  as  a  refugee  and   cannot   therefore
        reasonably be expected to return to Vietnam at all.  The  separation
        between the Appellant  and  his  daughter  could  not  therefore  be
        mitigated by visits until his UK status was resolved.    The  degree
        of interference would be substantial, and at such a significant time
        in his daughter's development would  have  a  long-term  detrimental
        impact  upon  her,  and  to  a  lesser  degree,  him.  It  would  be
        substantially contrary to her best interests.

    17. The second  feature  follows  from  the  first.  That  is  that  the
        circumstances of  this  case  are  such  that  the  requirements  of
        paragraph EX.1 (b) of the Rules is met:

            EX.1.      This paragraph applies if

            (a)

                 (i)   the applicant has a genuine and subsisting parental
                 relationship with a child who -

                     (aa)    is under the age of 18 years, or was under the
                     age of 18 years when the applicant was first granted
                     leave on the basis that this paragraph applied;

                     (bb)    is in the UK;  (cc) is a British Citizen or
                     has lived in the UK continuously for at least the 7
                     years immediately preceding the date of application ;
                     and

                 (ii)  it would not be reasonable to expect the child to
                 leave the UK; or

            (b)  the applicant has a genuine and subsisting relationship
            with a partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen,
            settled in the UK or in the UK with refugee leave or
            humanitarian protection, and there are insurmountable obstacles
            to family life with that partner continuing outside the UK.

            EX.2.      For the purposes of paragraph EX.1.(b)
            "insurmountable obstacles" means the very significant
            difficulties which would be faced by the applicant or their
            partner in continuing their family life together outside the UK
            and which could not be overcome or would entail very serious
            hardship for the applicant or their partner

    18. Ms Hoang is a refugee and as such I accept in this case  that  there
        are insurmountable obstacles to her returning to Vietnam.  As I have
        noted above, at today's date the  Appellant  cannot  "get  to"  EX.1
        because he does not qualify for consideration  as  a  partner.  Come
        September he will do, since he will  then  have  been  living  in  a
        relationship akin to marriage with Ms Hoang since September 2013.

    19. The appeal therefore boils down to this: should this man be returned
        to Vietnam today, with all the adverse consequences that  will  have
        for his daughter and his family life, when in September he will, all
        things being equal, qualify for leave to remain under the Rules.   I
        have taken the public interest considerations in s117B into account,
        and have weighed against the Appellant  the  fact  that  he  entered
        illegally and has no leave to remain.  Having done so  I  find  that
        balance is tipped - just - in the Appellant's favour.

   Decisions

    20. The decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  contains  no  errors  in
        respect of the protection claim and those parts of the determination
        are preserved. There is an error identified in respect of Article  8
        and those findings are set aside.

    21. I re-make the decision  insofar  as  it  relates  to  Article  8  as
        follows: the appeal is allowed on human rights grounds.

    22. I make no order for anonymity.
