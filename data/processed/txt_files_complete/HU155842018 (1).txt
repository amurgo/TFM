Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr C Howells, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr P J Lewis instructed by Legal Rights Partnership


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008  (SI  2008/2698)  I  make  an  anonymity  order  prohibiting   the
    disclosure or publication of any matter likely to lead members  of  the
    public identifying the respondent (JK).  A failure to comply with  this
    direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

 2. Although this is an appeal by the  Secretary  of  State,  I  shall  for
    convenience refer to the parties as they appeared before the First-tier
    Tribunal.

Background

 3. The appellant is a citizen of Rwanda who was born on 20 April 1964.  He
    has been lawfully resident in the United Kingdom  since  February  2002
    and was granted indefinite leave to remain in 2007.  His wife and three
    daughters joined him in the UK on 1 July 2008.  His two elder daughters
    are aged 22 and 18 and both are in university.  His youngest  daughter,
    "M" is 13 years of age.

 4. On 9 December 2016, the appellant was convicted at  the  Swansea  Crown
    Court of one offence of theft.  He  was  sentenced  to  twelve  months'
    imprisonment.

 5. On 21 December 2016, the appellant was served with a notice that it was
    proposed to deport him in accordance  with  the  automatic  deportation
    provisions in the UK Borders Act 2007.  He subsequently  made  a  human
    rights claim on 12 January 2017 (supplemented  by  further  submissions
    during 2017).  On 17 July 2018, the  Secretary  of  State  refused  the
    appellant's human rights claim under Art 8 of  the  ECHR.   On  9  July
    2018, the Secretary of State signed a deportation order in  respect  of
    the appellant.

The Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

 6. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  He relied upon  Art
    8 of the  ECHR  and  his  private  and  family  life  in  the  UK.   In
    particular, he relied upon the impact deportation  would  have  on  his
    children's education, including his youngest child M.  In  relation  to
    M, the  appellant  relied  upon  Exception  2  in  s.  117C(5)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 ("the NIA Act  2002")  and
    that his deportation would have an unduly harsh impact upon her.

 7. The appeal was heard by Judge N J Osborne on 11 December  2018.   In  a
    decision sent on 10 January 2019, Judge Osborne allowed the appellant's
    appeal under Art 8.   His  determination  is  a  lengthy,  careful  and
    detailed one.  At para 6, the judge set out the  appellant's  claim  as
    follows:

         "The Appellant's Claim


         6.   The Appellant claims that:


             (i)  He has been lawfully resident in the  UK  since  February
                  2002.  He was granted indefinite leave to remain in  2007.
                  His wife and three daughters joined him in  the  UK  on  1
                  July 2008.  The Appellant and all his  family  would  have
                  qualified for naturalisation as British citizens but  have
                  been unable to apply because of lack of funds.  The family
                  is now rooted and integrated in the  UK.   The  two  elder
                  daughters [] aged 22 years and []  aged  18/19  years  are
                  both in university studying on undergraduate courses.  The
                  youngest child M attends [] in Swansea, has  ambitions  is
                  to proceed to university in the UK.  M remembers  life  in
                  no other country.  It would be unduly  harsh  for  her  to
                  relocate to Rwanda.  It would be unduly  harsh  for  M  to
                  remain living in the UK without her father, the Appellant.


             (ii) The Appellant from the outset admitted and  accepted  his
                  guilt for the one isolated offence that he has  committed.
                  The offence was committed in highly unusual circumstances.
                   The Appellant has  been  forgiven  by  the  victim.   The
                  victim   has   been   repaid   again,   in   extraordinary
                  circumstances.  The Appellant has shown and  continues  to
                  show a genuine remorse for  his  criminal  offending.   He
                  represents a low risk of reoffending.  His  conduct  since
                  the offending has been  exemplary.   The  Appellant  still
                  feels shame and embarrassment.  The  Appellant's  criminal
                  offending has adversely affected his wife's health and the
                  family's finances.  Despite his  criminal  offending,  the
                  Appellant's community think no less of  him,  continue  to
                  trust him, and continue to value him.  The Appellant is an
                  honest, humble and selfless man whose deportation would be
                  a loss to the community.  Deportation in this  case  would
                  be disproportionate."


 8. Then, the judge set out the applicable law in relation  to  deportation
    and Art 8, including paras 398 and 399 of the Immigration Rules (HC 395
    as amended) and relevant provisions in Part 5 of the NIA  Act  2002  at
    paras 11-29.

 9. Then, at paras 30-31 under the heading "The Best Interests  of  M"  the
    judge said this:

         "30. I have undertaken that balancing exercise in  the  context  of
             Section 55 of the Borders,  Citizenship  and  Immigration  Act
             2009 and my duty to consider the best interests and welfare of
             any relevant children in an appeal such as this.


             [M], the third child of the Appellant and his wife is now aged
             13 years.  She is in year nine at [~].  She has lived  in  the
             UK for more than ten years.   She  has  never  lived  anywhere
             other than in the  UK  during  that  ten  year  period.   [The
             appellant's wife] told me that if it were suggested to M  that
             she had to leave Swansea in South Wales for a life  in  Rwanda
             she would consider it to  be  'child  abuse'.   She  is  fully
             integrated into her local community.  She is a normal teenager
             who has over the last ten years developed  close  friendships.
             She enjoys school.  She is ambitious to succeed and to proceed
             to university like her sisters.


         31.  This evidence on the part of [the appellant's  wife]  had  the
             distinct and realistic ring of truth about it.   There  is  no
             suggestion that the Appellant and [the appellant's  wife]  are
             anything other than appropriate,  competent,  loving  parents.
             It is well-established that children are more likely to thrive
             if they are brought up in conditions of  stability.   For  the
             most part that  is  precisely  what  these  two  parents  have
             provided for all three of their children.  The  Appellant  and
             his wife are a loving couple with  a  strong  marriage.   That
             marriage has withstood the Appellant's absence from the family
             home in Rwanda whilst he adapted to a life in the UK  and  has
             also withstood the difficulties  of  the  Appellant's  absence
             from the family home when he was in prison for a period of six
             months.


             Six months is a long time  in  the  life  of  a  young  child.
             However, ten years in the context of M's life is virtually all
             the life that she can remember.  M has lived in the UK for 80%
             or thereabouts of her 13 years.  She can have little memory of
             life in Rwanda.  All her education to date has been  spent  in
             the UK.  She has an established home and an established way of
             life in Swansea.  Whereas I am confident that if she  followed
             her parents to any country in the world,  they  would  do  the
             best they could for her, the fact remains that at  this  stage
             in her development and education,  having  already  spent  ten
             years in the UK, it is not in the best interests of M  to  now
             relocate to any other country.  The best interests of M are  a
             primary consideration in this appeal.  M's best interests  can
             be outweighed by other competing factors which also have to be
             assessed."


10. At paras 32-37, the judge dealt with, what he described in the  heading
    of this section, as "The Unique Features of  the  Appellant's  Criminal
    Offending" as follows:

         "32. In early  2012  [Mr  K]  was  diagnosed  with  serious  kidney
             failure.  He was put on dialysis.  He  lives  in  Oxford.   At
             that time the Appellant and his family lived in Reading.  They
             were members of the Seventh Day Adventist Church which used to
             congregate in Oxford.  They visited members of the Seventh Day
             Adventist Church  community  in  Oxford.   That  is  when  the
             Appellant realised that K was in a  critical  condition.   The
             Appellant felt the urge to  assist  [Mr  K].   They  were  not
             related.  They did not know each  other  until  the  Appellant
             became aware  of  [Mr  K]'s  plight.   The  Appellant  thought
             carefully but relatively quickly about the matter and  decided
             to donate his  kidney  to  [Mr  K].   On  10  April  2014  the
             transplant was conducted.  After  the  Appellant  donated  his
             kidney, his health was adversely affected.  He was  unable  to
             work.  He and his family suffered financial difficulties.


             [Mr K] benefited  from  the  kidney  transplant.   His  health
             improved.  In September 2015 he began a postgraduate course at
             [~] and now has a Master of Arts  degree  in  development  and
             emergency practice.  [Mr K] considers that the Appellant saved
             his life and  wonders  how  many  people  would  do  what  the
             Appellant did for him.


         33.  In or about March 2012, [Mr D], a well-established  friend  of
             the Appellant who was a pastor who attended the same church as
             the Appellant in Reading and who was applying  for  asylum  in
             the UK, asked the Appellant if he could  use  the  Appellant's
             bank account to deposit his own money initially  of  �2,997.73
             but later an additional �20,000 or thereabouts.  The Appellant
             agreed and was pleased to help.


         34.  Following the Appellant's donation of his kidney  as  referred
             to above, the Appellant suffered ill health,  time  off  work,
             and financial hardship.  Gradually,  the  Appellant  used  the
             money in his account which belonged to [Mr D].  The money  was
             spent not on  luxuries  but  for  the  basics  of  life.   The
             Appellant always intended to replace the money.  When  [Mr  D]
             asked for the money earlier than the Appellant  expected,  the
             Appellant applied for loans but due to his difficult financial
             position, was unable to  obtain  any  appropriate  loan.   The
             Appellant told [Mr D] the true position.   Naturally,  [Mr  D]
             was furious with the Appellant who apologised and was  ashamed
             of what he had done.  He promised to repay [Mr D] who reported
             the matter to the police only as a means of  pressurising  the
             Appellant to repay those sums which were due.


         35.  The  police  brought  charges.   The  Appellant  promptly  and
             immediately admitted his guilt and his shame.   The  Appellant
             has never resiled from that position.  He  still  acknowledges
             his guilt and his  shame  and  to  a  considerable  degree  is
             haunted by his offending.


         36.   In  this  appeal  I  have  been  referred  to  the  mediation
             settlement which appears in the Appellant's bundle at page 100
             and which is signed by [Mr D] and [Mr R] and which document is
             dated  3  February  2017.   Additionally,  I  have  read   the
             statement of [Mr D].  He has forgiven the Appellant,  provided
             that statement  for  use  in  these  appeal  proceedings,  and
             confirmed that he never intended or desired the  Appellant  to
             be criminally punished.  I have been told that [Mr D]  has  in
             fact apologised to the Appellant for putting him  through  the
             trauma of criminal proceedings and a period  of  imprisonment.
             I have no reason to doubt any of the evidence  that  has  been
             produced  in  this  appeal.   I  take  it  all  into   careful
             consideration.  These are singularly unusual  features  of  an
             appeal such as this.


         37.  The one other offence upon the Appellant's  list  of  previous
             convictions is failing to surrender to custody at an appointed
             time on  11  November  2016.   Having  heard  the  Appellant's
             explanation during the hearing, I am satisfied that  that  was
             nothing more than a misunderstanding between the Appellant and
             his solicitors and  that  although  the  Appellant  failed  to
             surrender,  he  did  so  due   to   naivety   and   the   said
             misunderstanding rather than any criminal intent."


11. Then, at paras 38 and 39 the judge dealt with the OASys Report and that
    the appellant's risk of future offending was low.

12. Then, at  paras  40-43  the  judge  dealt  with  "The  Effects  of  the
    Appellant's Offending Upon His Family" as follows:

         "40. Specifically, the  family  suffered  financially  due  to  the
             imprisonment of the Appellant.  He was unable to contribute to
             the family income by way of his earnings.


         41.  [The appellant's wife]  was  emotionally  traumatised  by  the
             revelation that her previously faultless husband had committed
             the material criminal offence.  It was at that time  that  she
             began suffering from high blood pressure.   She  continues  to
             suffer in that way, a condition which is  controlled  by  oral
             medication.  The Appellant is aware of  the  effect  that  his
             criminal offending has had upon his wife's health.


         42.  [The eldest daughter], whilst in her first year of  university
             suffered a breakdown due to the emotional stress she  suffered
             as a direct result of her father's criminal offending.   [She]
             was  unable  to  cope  with  being  away  from  home  and  the
             commitment her studies needed.  She dropped out of  university
             in order to recover.  She has recovered  and  is  now  in  her
             second year at [].


         43.  The Appellant and his wife therefore  have  two  daughters  at
             university.  They are funded by  means  of  a  combination  of
             government loans and private funding from  the  Appellant  and
             [the appellant's wife].  The Appellant is all too  aware  that
             if he is deported to Rwanda, the family and the  education  of
             his  daughters  will  be  imperilled  or  at  least   rendered
             significantly more expensive.  Although it  will  be  possible
             for all three daughters to continue to be  educated  with  the
             assistance of loans provided by the government, the  Appellant
             and his wife are committed parents who wish  to  assist  their
             daughters as much as is  possible.   That  is  what  they  are
             financially doing.  These are all matters which  I  take  into
             consideration  in  assessing  the   proportionality   of   the
             Respondent's Decision."


13. At para 44,  the  judge  recognised  the  appellant's  remorse  at  his
    offending.  Then  at  para  45  the  judge  referred  to  a  number  of
    "supporters" from the appellant's church and his friends concerning his
    contribution to the community.  At para 46, the  judge  identified  the
    nature of the appellant's offending and that the offence  was  one  for
    which he was imprisoned for twelve months  commenting  that  it  was  a
    "relatively lenient sentence for the theft  of  such  a  large  sum  of
    money".

14. Then at paras 47-51 the judge set out his conclusions in respect of Art
    8 and his finding that the appellant's deportation would breach  Art  8
    as follows:

         "47. Pursuant to the judgment in Hesham Ali [2016] UKSC 16  I  have
             conducted the above structured approach to proportionality  on
             the basis of the facts as I have  found  them  to  be  on  the
             evidence in this particular appeal, the law as established  by
             statute, and case law.  Ultimately, I have to  decide  whether
             deportation is proportionate in  this  particular  appeal.   I
             have balanced the strength  of  the  public  interest  in  the
             deportation of the  Appellant  against  the  impact  upon  the
             private and family life not only of the Appellant but  of  the
             three other present members of his immediate family.   I  have
             given appropriate weight to Parliament's and the Secretary  of
             State's assessments of the  strength  of  the  general  public
             interest in the deportation of  foreign  offenders  which  the
             Appellant undoubtedly is.  Having  given  due  weight  to  the
             strength of the public interest and  the  deportation  of  the
             Appellant in this appeal, I nonetheless find that the  Article
             8  appeal  is  sufficiently  strong  to  outweigh  the  public
             interest in his deportation.  This particular Article 8  claim
             for all the reasons I have set out above is very strong and is
             very compelling (as it was put in MF (Nigeria)  [2014]  1  WLR
             544).  That is why I find in all  the  circumstances  of  this
             appeal, the Appellant's appeal must succeed.


         48.  Having said that,  the  Appellant  should  not  be  under  any
             illusion  that  if  he  should  commit  any  further  criminal
             offences, those new criminal offences  will  be  bound  to  be
             taken into consideration in  any  future  appeal  before  this
             Tribunal which might well in any future  proceedings  tip  the
             balance against the Appellant.  I know because  Mr  Lewis  was
             careful enough to ensure  that  the  Appellant  gave  specific
             evidence upon this issue, that the Appellant is fully aware of
             what is likely to happen to him  if  he  commits  any  further
             offences at all.


         49.  Applying the relevant law to the established facts I find that
             the deportation of the Appellant is  not  proportionate  in  a
             democratic society to the legitimate aim to be  achieved.   On
             the established facts, I find that there is a  breach  of  the
             Appellant's rights under the 1950 Human Rights Convention.   I
             conclude  that  the  deportation  of  this  Appellant  is  not
             appropriate upon the facts of this appeal.


         50.   I  remind  myself  of  the  established  and  indeed  current
             authority of Beoku-Betts v SSHD [2009] 1 AC 115.  I find  that
             the five  constituent  members  of  this  family  include  the
             Appellant, his wife,  [two  older  daughters],  and  M.   Even
             though [the two older daughters] are adults, the fact  of  the
             matter remains that they are still part of  the  family  unit.
             They have not established independent family  lives  of  their
             own.  They are members of the same household albeit that  they
             are  presently  studying  at  university.   They  are  largely
             financed by their parents.  That financial  contribution  made
             by the  Appellant  and  [the  appellant's  wife]  fulfils  the
             requirements of the well-established  case  of  Kugathas  (see
             above) in that insofar as the  adult  children  are  concerned
             there is between them and their parents  something  more  than
             the usual emotional dependency.  In part, it is the  emotional
             difficulties previously suffered by [the eldest daughter]  and
             the health difficulties suffered  by  [the  appellant's  wife]
             coupled with the financial difficulties suffered by the family
             all due to the absence of the Appellant during his  period  of
             imprisonment that would make it unduly harsh for M to continue
             living in  the  UK  in  the  absence  of  her  father.   Those
             difficulties previously (and to an extent presently)  suffered
             by  this  family  unit  are  an  indication  of  the   further
             difficulties that would be suffered were the Appellant  to  be
             absent from this family unit  for  any  protracted  period  of
             time.


         51.  For these and for all the other reasons I have set out  above,
             I consider  that  the  Respondent's  Decision  to  deport  the
             Appellant is in all the circumstances not proportionate  in  a
             democratic society to the legitimate aim to be achieved."


The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

15. The Secretary of  State  sought  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal on the ground that the judge had failed properly  to  apply  a
    structured approach to Art 8 as required by s.  117C  of  the  NIA  Act
    2002: first, by considering whether Exception 1 or Exception  2  in  s.
    117C(4) and (5) applied; and  secondly,  if  neither  applied,  whether
    there  were  "very  compelling  circumstances,  over  and  above  those
    described in Exceptions 1 and 2" (s. 117C(6)).

16. Permission to appeal was initially refused by the  First-tier  Tribunal
    but on 12 March 2019,  the  Upper  Tribunal  (UTJ  Grubb)  granted  the
    appellant permission to appeal on the basis that it was arguable:

         "that in allowing the appeal the judge failed to  consider  whether
         the appellant could rely upon Exception 2 in s. 117C(5) of the  NIA
         Act 2002 in respect of the impact upon his third child if  he  were
         deported and, further thereafter (if it were  not  met)  failed  to
         apply the 'very compelling circumstances over and above' test in s.
         117C(6)".

17. On 10 May 2019, the appellant filed  a  rule  24  response  seeking  to
    uphold the judge's decision on the basis that the judge was entitled to
    find that there were "very  compelling  circumstances  over  and  above
    those in Exceptions 1 and 2".

18. Prior to the hearing of the appeal,  I  caused  the  administration  to
    contact both representatives as the case was due to be listed before me
    and I had granted the Secretary of State permission  to  appeal.   Both
    representatives responded that they were content that I should hear the
    appeal and that was  confirmed  at  the  hearing  by  Mr  Howells,  who
    represented the Secretary of State and Mr  Lewis  who  represented  the
    appellant.

Submissions

19. Mr Howells, on behalf  of  the  Secretary  of  State  relied  upon  the
    decision of the Court of Appeal in NA (Pakistan) v SSHD [2016] EWCA Civ
    662 at [36].  There, he submitted, the Court of Appeal  indicated  that
    the correct approach was first to consider whether an individual  could
    rely upon either Exception 1 or Exception 2 where he had been sentenced
    to a period of imprisonment of at least twelve  months  but  less  than
    four years and then, secondly, if he could not, then go on to  consider
    whether there were  "very  compelling  circumstances"  over  and  above
    Exceptions 1 and 2 applying s. 117C(6) (see [27]).   Here,  Mr  Howells
    submitted the judge had  failed  to  consider  whether  either  of  the
    Exceptions applied to the appellant and, instead, had simply gone on to
    ask whether they were  "very  compelling  circumstances".   Mr  Howells
    acknowledged that the judge had stated in para 50 that the  appellant's
    imprisonment would "make it unduly harsh for [M] to continue living  in
    the UK in the absence of her father" but it was  not  clear  the  basis
    upon which he had reached that  finding.   Further,  the  judge's  only
    reference to the "very compelling circumstances" test in  his  findings
    was at para 47 where it was unclear that he had approached  it  on  the
    basis of whether the circumstances  were  "very  compelling"  and  were
    "over and above" those in Exceptions 1 and 2.

20. Mr Lewis, who represented the appellant submitted that  the  judge  had
    concluded  that  Exception  2  applied  in  para   50.    However,   he
    acknowledged that in considering M's circumstances, the judge at  paras
    30-31 had only considered her "best interests".  He submitted that  the
    judge had made a  sustainable  finding  on  whether  there  were  "very
    compelling circumstances" and that s. 117C(6) applied and so any  error
    that he may have made was immaterial.

21. In response, Mr Howells  submitted  that  NA  (Pakistan)  set  out  the
    correct approach.  The judge had not dealt with  "undue  harshness"  in
    relation to the appellant's partner and had made no finding whether  it
    was "unduly  harsh"  for  the  appellant's  partner  and  his  youngest
    daughter to go to Rwanda.

Discussion

22. There is no doubt that the appellant is a "foreign criminal"  to  which
    Part 5A of the NIA Act 2002 applies as he was sentenced to a period  of
    imprisonment of "at least  twelve  months":  in  fact,  twelve  months'
    imprisonment for the single offence of theft.

23. In determining whether the appellant's  deportation  was  proportionate
    and therefore whether or not it would breach Art 8, s. 117C sets out  a
    number of "additional considerations" relevant  to  the  assessment  of
    proportionality.  Section 117C(1)-(6) provides as follows:

         "117C Article  8:  additional  considerations  in  cases  involving
         foreign criminals

         (1)   The  deportation  of  foreign  criminals  is  in  the  public
             interest.

         (2)  The more serious the offence committed by a foreign  criminal,
             the greater is the  public  interest  in  deportation  of  the
             criminal.

         (3)  In the case of a foreign  criminal  ('C')  who  has  not  been
             sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years  or  more,
             the public interest requires C's deportation unless  Exception
             1 or Exception 2 applies.

         (4)  Exception 1 applies where-

             (a)      C has been lawfully resident in  the  United  Kingdom
                  for most of C's life,

             (b)      C is socially and culturally integrated in the United
                  Kingdom, and

             (c)      there would be  very  significant  obstacles  to  C's
                  integration into the country to which C is proposed to  be
                  deported.

         (5)  Exception 2 applies where  C  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
             relationship with a  qualifying  partner,  or  a  genuine  and
             subsisting parental relationship with a qualifying child,  and
             the effect of C's deportation on the partner or child would be
             unduly harsh.

         (6)  In the case of a foreign criminal who has been sentenced to  a
             period of imprisonment of at  least  four  years,  the  public
             interest requires deportation unless there are very compelling
             circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions  1
             and 2.

             ..."

24. In NA (Pakistan) which was subsequently approved by the Court of Appeal
    in NE-A (Nigeria) v SSHD  [2017]  EWCA  Civ  2,  the  Court  of  Appeal
    emphasised that the approach to determining the Art 8 issue in  a  case
    such as that of the appellant was, first to consider whether  Exception
    1 in s. 117C(4) applied or Exception (2) in s. 117C(5) applied.   Then,
    if they did not the court should go on to consider whether  there  were
    "very compelling circumstances,  over  and  above  those  described  in
    Exceptions 1 and 2" as required by s. 117C(6) even though  it  applied,
    on its face, only to those foreign criminals who had been sentenced  to
    a period of imprisonment of at least four years.

25. There is no  suggestion  that  Exception  1  applies  here.   The  only
    Exception which the appellant relied upon was Exception 2.  There is no
    doubt the appellant's wife is a "qualifying partner" (she has ILR)  and
    also there is no doubt that her relationship with the  appellant  is  a
    "genuine and subsisting relationship".  Likewise, M (but not his  older
    children) is a "qualifying child" as she has lived  in  the  UK  for  a
    continuous period of seven years or more.  Similarly, there is no doubt
    that his relationship with her is a "genuine  and  subsisting  parental
    relationship".  Exception 2, therefore, upon which  the  appellant  did
    rely, applied if the impact upon his wife and youngest child if he were
    deported would be "unduly harsh".

26. It is clear that the judge made no finding at all in  relation  to  the
    impact upon the appellant's spouse, nor, did he  make  any  finding  in
    respect of whether it would be unduly harsh for his wife  and  youngest
    daughter to return to Rwanda with  him.   That  was  an  issue  as  the
    respondent did not accept it would be unduly harsh for them to live  in
    Rwanda (see [19] of the determination).  Mr Lewis, in his  submissions,
    accepted that the judge had made no relevant  findings  in  respect  of
    those matters.

27. In respect of the judge's finding that it would be unduly harsh  for  M
    to remain in the UK (presumably with her mother) if the appellant  were
    deported, Mr Lewis acknowledged that in paras 30-31, the judge had only
    considered M's best interests.   That,  in  my  judgment,  is  entirely
    correct.  Whilst the best interests of M were a  primary  consideration
    in determining whether the impact of the appellant's deportation  would
    be unduly harsh upon her, her best interests were not,  in  themselves,
    necessarily determinative of whether the impact would be unduly  harsh.



28. The correct approach to  whether  the  impact  of  deportation  upon  a
    qualifying child (or indeed upon a qualifying partner) would be  unduly
    harsh was set out in the Upper Tribunal decision in MK [2015] UKUT  223
    (IAC) which was subsequently approved by the Supreme Court  see  in  KO
    (Nigeria) and Ors v SSHD [2018] UKSC 53 at [27].  In  MK  at  [46]  the
    Upper Tribunal said this:

         "By way of self-direction, we are mindful that 'unduly harsh'  does
         not equate with uncomfortable, inconvenient, undesirable or  merely
         difficult.   Rather,  it  poses  a   considerably   more   elevated
         threshold.  'Harsh' in this context, denotes something  severe,  or
         bleak.   It  is  the  antithesis  of   pleasant   or   comfortable.
         Furthermore, the addition of the adverb 'unduly' raises an  already
         elevated standard still higher."

29. To the extent that the judge made a finding that it  would  be  "unduly
    harsh" for M to continue living in the UK in the absence of her father,
    despite his careful and detailed statement of  the  relevant  law,  the
    judge nowhere sets out the high threshold recognised in MK such that  I
    can be satisfied that he approached the issue of "unduly harsh"  in  s.
    117C(5) with the appropriate  high  threshold  in  mind.   The  judge's
    reasons, given in para [50], appear to rely upon the  effect  that  the
    appellant's imprisonment had upon the other members of the family.   In
    particular, the judge refers to the emotional difficulties suffered  by
    the appellant's two elder daughters, the health problems  of  his  wife
    and the financial difficulties encountered  due  to  his  imprisonment.
    This can only be a reference to the judge's assessment of the  evidence
    at paras 40-43 which I have set out above.  It is difficult to see  how
    these difficulties, even if replicated were the appellant deported, can
    be said to produce an "undue harsh" impact upon M.  At  least,  without
    further reasoning, any such finding is, in my judgment, unsustainable.

30. Consequently, whilst I do not accept Mr Howells'  submission  that  the
    judge failed to make a finding in respect of  whether  it  was  "unduly
    harsh" for M to remain in the UK if the appellant  were  deported,  his
    finding is not, in my  view,  adequately  reasoned  and  based  upon  a
    correct self-direction as to the high  threshold  as  set  out  in  MK.
    There is also the difficulty that he made no  finding  in  relation  to
    whether it was unduly harsh for the appellant's wife to remain  in  the
    UK without the appellant or for her and M to return to Rwanda with him.



31. Overall, these amounted to errors of law.

32. Mr Lewis submitted that this was immaterial as the judge had concluded,
    and  was  entitled  to  conclude,  that  there  were  "very  compelling
    circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions 1 and 2" in
    any event.  The difficulty with Mr Lewis' submission is that if that is
    what the judge did, his premise was not established.  Namely  that  the
    appellant fell within Exception 2.  Indeed, of  course,  if  the  judge
    considered that Exception 2 applied, then he did not need to go on  and
    consider whether s. 117C(6) applied; the appellant simply succeeded  in
    his appeal because if Exception 2 applied then deportation was  not  in
    the public interest.  By going on to consider whether there were  "very
    compelling" circumstances, the judge either thought  that  Exception  2
    did not apply (but his finding is to the contrary in para  50),  or  in
    approaching the application of s. 117C(6) he did so on the  basis  that
    deportation would be unduly harsh upon M but that is a finding  he  was
    not entitled to make, in my judgment.

33. That, in my view, undermines the judge's finding in para  47  that  the
    claim was "very compelling".  There is, as  Mr  Howells  submitted,  no
    reference in para 47 to the  "over  and  above"  part  of  s.  117C(6).
    Indeed, the judge's reference to "very compelling" is to the case of MF
    (Nigeria) v SSHD [2014] 1 WLR 544 which was decided before s. 117C.

34. I accept that there were 'strong' factors in  the  appellant's  favour,
    not least his altruistic donation of a kidney (see paras 32-33) and his
    post-offending remorse (see paras 34-37 and 44).   However,  in  truth,
    without a sustainable  finding  in  relation  to  Exception  2,  it  is
    difficult  to  conclude   that   the   judge's   reasoning   that   the
    circumstances, including those not covered by Exception 2, were of such
    a compelling nature as to outweigh the public interest  in  any  event.
    The financial circumstances of the family, even without the  appellant,
    were not dire.  They have ILR and there is no  suggestion  that  whilst
    the appellant was in prison they were destitute or  unable  to  survive
    financially.  The judge's reliance upon the desire of the appellant and
    his wife to fund their daughters' university education  underplays  the
    fact, which the judge recognises, that Government loans  are  available
    both to his two older daughters and, in the future, no doubt to M.

35. For these reasons, the judge erred in law in his approach to Art 8  and
    the application of s.  117C.   Further,  he  failed  to  give  adequate
    reasons for concluding, that (in effect) Exception 2  applied  and,  in
    any event, that if it did  not  the  appellant  had  established  "very
    compelling circumstances, over and above" those described in Exceptions
    1 and 2.



Decision

36. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal to allow the appellant's appeal
    under Art 8 involved the making of  a  material  error  of  law.   That
    decision cannot stand and is set aside.

37. It was common ground between the representatives that if  that  was  my
    conclusion, the proper disposal of the appeal was to remit  it  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal for a de novo rehearing.  I agree.   Having  regard
    to the nature and extent of fact-finding, and having regard to para 7.2
    of the Senior President's Practice Statement, the  proper  disposal  of
    this appeal is to remit it to the First-tier Tribunal  for  a  de  novo
    rehearing (with no findings preserved) to be heard  by  a  judge  other
    than Judge N J Osborne.
