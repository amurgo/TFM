For the appellant:      No appearance
For the respondent:     Mr E Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    This appeal comes before the Upper Tribunal  following  the  grant  of
    permission by Upper Tribunal Judge Chalkley on 13 May 2013.

2.    The appellant is a citizen of Ghana born  on  15  September  1980.  He
    arrived in the UK with the help of an agent in 2006  and  has  remained
    without authorisation ever since. On 27 July 2007 he sought a residence
    card as the extended family member of one Mr.  Franklin  Agyeman  which
    was refused on 20 March 2008. On 11 November 2010 he applied again  for
    a residence card as the cousin of the  same  individual  and  this  was
    refused again on 4 March 2011.

3.    On 7 April 2012 the appellant applied for an  EEA  residence  card  as
    the spouse of Melissa Sophie Larochelle, a  French  national,  whom  he
    claimed to have married by proxy in Ghana on 7 January 2011.  According
    to the statutory declaration accompanying the marriage certificate, the
    sponsor's parents are also both French nationals.  On  8  October  2012
    this application was also  refused.  The  respondent  noted  that  this
    marriage was not registered until 13 March  2012,  after  the  required
    three  months  registration  period.  Furthermore,  the  data  on   the
    statutory declaration did not accord with  the  date  on  the  marriage
    certificate, the former giving the date in 2012 and the latter in 2011.
    The respondent raised concerns about the authenticity of  the  marriage
    certificate. It was also considered that no documentary evidence of the
    sponsor's residence in the UK had been produced other than a  photocopy
    of a single bank letter. In the absence of any  original  evidence,  it
    was not accepted that she was residing in the UK.

4.    An appeal was lodged against the decision but an oral hearing was  not
    requested. The matter came before First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Prickett
    who determined the appeal on the papers and dismissed it by  way  of  a
    determination promulgated on 4 April 2013.  Permission  to  appeal  was
    sought but refused by First-tier Tribunal Judge Easterman on  24  April
    2013. It was however granted upon renewal by the Upper Tribunal  solely
    on the basis that "a  Panel  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  are  shortly  to
    consider the issue of customary and proxy marriages". On  31  May  2013
    the respondent prepared a response to the grounds of appeal under  Rule
    24 and maintained that the grant of permission  did  not  identify  any
    arguable error of law and that the reasoning of the judge based on  the
    evidence available had been open to him to make.

The hearing

5.    There  was  no  attendance  by  the  appellant,  the  sponsor  or  his
    representative when the appeal came before me on 15 July 2013.  I  note
    that the same solicitors had instructed Counsel in a  similar  type  of
    appeal heard earlier in my list.  There  being  no  appearance  and  no
    message received by 11:15 AM,  I  proceeded  with  the  appeal  in  the
    appellant's absence.

6.    I heard submissions from Mr. Tufan who submitted that  the  judge  had
    been entitled to reject the reliability of the appellant's evidence. He
    took me through the Lloyds TSB bank statements, purportedly  pertaining
    to the sponsor, that had been submitted by the appellant in support  of
    his earlier appeal showing her address as 2 Cliff Walk, London E16.  He
    pointed out that not only did the figures not add up to the totals  and
    balances shown, but that the statement at C15 related  to  transactions
    between 13 November and 13 December  2013.  In  the  circumstances,  he
    submitted that it was open to the judge to reject  the  reliability  of
    the appellant's evidence and to dismiss the appeal.
7.    Mr Tufan also pointed out that the Customary Marriage and Divorce  Act
    of Ghana required both parties to be Ghanaian nationals but  there  was
    no evidence that the sponsor was anything but French and  the  evidence
    showed that her parents were French too. He asked that the decision  of
    the judge be upheld.

Findings and Conclusions

 8.   The grounds argue that the judge erred in requiring  the  marriage  to
    be registered within three months of taking place. It  is  argued  that
    this requirement does not exist under Ghanaian law  and  that  all  the
    requirements of the law had been met. The situation  is,  however,  not
    that clear cut and the grounds do not fairly represent what  the  judge
    decided in his determination.

9.    The judge did not dismiss the appeal  because  the  marriage  had  not
    been registered in time but because he did not  believe  it  had  taken
    place. There is a significant difference between the two.

10.   According to section  2(2)  of  the  Customary  Marriage  and  Divorce
    (Registration) Act 1985,  there  is  a  legal  obligation  to  register
    customary marriages within three months. A failure to do  so  does  not
    invalidate it but that is not the issue the judge was  concerned  with.
    The appellant's evidence was that the marriage was registered.  Why  it
    was registered some 15 months after the event is not clear, nor  is  it
    clear why he waited 16 months after  the  marriage  to  apply  for  his
    residence card or why, if he had known he was about to get married,  he
    would have made an application for  a  residence  card  as  the  family
    member of his cousin. If the reference to the date of marriage as  2012
    on the statutory declaration was an error,  it  is  not  explained  why
    evidence from the parties who prepared it was not obtained  to  confirm
    their mistake. The judge was entitled to expect such evidence could  be
    easily obtained. With regard to all the requirements of the law  having
    been met, that is not established as the law requires the parties to be
    Ghanaian nationals and there is no evidence that the sponsor is a  dual
    national. It also requires consummation by  cohabitation  and  I  shall
    come to the evidence of residence later. These are however issues  that
    were not relied on by the judge in any event.

11.   It is also argued that the burden was on the respondent to prove  that
    the marriage certificate was not an authentic document. That  is  quite
    correct and the judge did indeed direct himself accordingly, finding at
    paragraph 8 that the respondent had not discharged  the  responsibility
    of proving the document was a forgery.

12.   It  is  maintained  that  cohabitation  was  not  required  under  the
    Regulations. That is also correct  but  the  respondent  had  not  been
    satisfied that the sponsor was residing in the UK, which is a different
    point.

13.   I do not follow the argument in paragraphs 9 and 10  of  the  grounds.
    It is maintained that the error of the date of marriage  was  corrected
    but the grounds do not clarify where this may be seen. It is said  that
    the marriage certificate  shows  the  correct  date  of  2011.  I  have
    addressed these issues above at paragraph 10.

14.   The appellant has not considered it necessary to attend  this  hearing
    or to instruct his representative to attend on his  behalf.  Given  the
    judge's concerns about the credibility of the  claim,  one  might  have
    expected that he would have attended along with his sponsor but in  his
    absence I have considered the grounds and all the evidence with care.

15.   The reliability of the claim as a whole was questioned  by  the  judge
    and had he examined the documents even more carefully than  he  did  he
    would have found even more reasons to support his  conclusions.  Having
    looked at the documents myself and  having  been  directed  to  certain
    matters by Mr Tufan, I am satisfied the judge  was  fully  entitled  to
    find that the appellant's claim was  not  made  out.  It  is  of  great
    concern that the appellant has, through his representatives,  submitted
    bank statements which on the face of it are wholly unreliable.

16.   I do not accept that Lloyds TSB  Bank  would  have  issued  statements
    with incorrect sums or indeed relating to transactions and balances  at
    a date some five months in the future.  The  originals  have  not  been
    produced and it may be seen that the  sections  bearing  the  sponsor's
    name and address differ in font to the rest of  the  statement  and  in
    certain  part  show  distortion  whereas  there  is  no   corresponding
    distortion on the rest of the document. Furthermore, at C14,  the  bank
    statement shows a debit card payment to Selfridge's of London spelt  as
    Selfirdges. The statements are wholly unreliable  as  evidence  of  the
    sponsor's residence in the UK.

17.   The pay slips  of  the  sponsor  strangely  each  bear  the  same  net
    payment. The dates on the payslips do not accord with the  deposits  of
    those amounts as shown in the bank statements. The Sky statement at  B3
    of the appellant's bundle purports to have been issued on � 29 November
    2012. The insertion of the � sign is most  unusual.  The  same  anomaly
    applies to the statements of 29 December 2012 at B2 and 29 January 2013
    at B1. Additionally,  the  payments  for  Sky  as  shown  in  the  bank
    statements do not accord with the bills that have been adduced.

18.   The appellant has argued in his statement and indeed  in  the  grounds
    that  the  Secretary  of  State  had  retained  his  original  marriage
    certificate and therefore prevented him from having  it  authenticated.
    However there is evidence from the respondent to show that, contrary to
    what the appellant maintains, the original certificates  and  affidavit
    were returned to him at his alleged address on 7 February  2013  before
    he prepared statement and long before the grounds  were  prepared.  The
    sponsor's statement prepared at the same time and in  almost  identical
    terms to be appellant's also makes the same unjustified complaint.

19.   I was also referred to the  appellant's  tenancy  agreement  which  is
    described as a short-term six-month contract however  the  duration  of
    the tenancy has been given as three years. This  anomaly  also  remains
    unresolved. Further, the rent as shown on the tenancy agreement of  �75
    per week inclusive of bills does not correspond to the amount  of  �325
    per calendar month on the accompanying letter from Crown  Lettings  and
    the signatures on that letter and on the two tenancy agreements for the
    landlord, Mr Martin, who also seems to be the agent at  Crown  Lettings
    are completely different. Different telephone numbers  are  also  given
    for Mr. Martin at D4 and at D1 despite the same address being given.

20.   I note further that the endorsement of  Alexander  Kofi  Baah  on  the
    statutory  declaration  describes  his  occupation  as   a   barrister,
    solicitor, notray (sic) public and a management consultant.  I  do  not
    accept that he would use an endorsement  that  incorrectly  spells  his
    position as a Notary Public.

21.   It is not explained how the signatures of the  appellant  and  sponsor
    appear on the marriage certificate given that they were not there  when
    it took place or when it was registered.

22.   For all  these  reasons  I  find  that  the  judge  was  justified  in
    questioning the credibility of this claim.     No  errors  of  law  are
    disclosed in his determination. If anything, he did not go  far  enough
    in his findings and conclusions.  Given  the  major  difficulties  with
    almost all the appellant's documents, it is perhaps not surprising that
    he did not attend court. What is surprising is that his representatives
    agreed to submit and rely on them.

Decision

23.   No errors of law have been found. The  determination  to  dismiss  the
    appeal is upheld.


Signed:



Dr R Keki?
Upper Tribunal Judge

NB:   Upon completion of this determination I was handed a letter dated 12
July 2013 (received on 16 July) from the appellant's representatives
confirming they were without instructions and were no longer representing
the appellant.
