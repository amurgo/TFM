Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr J Dhanji, Counsel instructed by Haris Ali
                    Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

      1. The appellant challenges the determination of  First-tier  Tribunal
         Judge Keane promulgated on 20  March  2017  dismissing  his  appeal
         against the respondent's decision of 14 November 2015 to refuse  to
         issue him with a permanent residence card under  reg.  15(1)(b)  of
         the EEA Regulations.


      2. The appellant is a national of Pakistan, born on 10 December  1978.
         He arrived in the UK for studies in May 2005  and  on  11  February
         2010 he married a  Polish  national  and  subsequently  obtained  a
         residence card on 6  December  2010,  valid  for  five  years.  His
         marriage subsequently broke down and he was divorced on 10  January
         2014. He made an application for permanent  residence  on  3  April
         2014 but this was refused on 9 May 2014. The  appellant  lodged  an
         appeal but it appears that  the  Presenting  Officer  withdrew  the
         negative decision and a residence card was granted  on  28  October
         2014 on the basis of his retained rights of residence. On  25  June
         2015, the appellant made an application  for  permanent  residence;
         the refusal of that application gives rise to these proceedings.



      3. Judge Keane was not satisfied that the appellant had shown that  he
         had been residing in the UK in accordance with the Regulations  for
         a continuous period of five years and dismissed the appeal.



      4. Permission to appeal  was  granted  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
         Brunnen on 9 October 2017 on the  basis  that  the  judge  arguably
         disregarded documentary evidence to show  the  appellant  had  been
         employed since December 2012 and had failed to  appreciate  that  a
         residence card had most recently been issued in October 2014.



      5. The respondent, in  her  Rule  24  response,  did  not  oppose  the
         application for permission and invited the Tribunal to consider the
         appeal at a continuance hearing. The matter then came before me.



      6. The Hearing



      7. The appellant attended the hearing.



      8. Mr Tufan  confirmed  the  contents  of  the  respondent's  Rule  24
         response.



      9. The parties were agreed that the issue to be  decided  was  whether
         the appellant had completed five years of continuous  residence  in
         accordance with the Regulations including a  period  prior  to  the
         breakdown of the marriage. On that  basis,  they  were  content  to
         proceed with the hearing before me on the basis of submissions.



     10. Fresh documentary evidence from the appellant  was  admitted  under
         rule 15(2A) of the Upper Tribunal Procedure Rules 2008.



     11. Mr Dhanji then made his submissions. He submitted that the relevant
         five-year period was from January 2012 to January 2017 although the
         appellant continued to be employed by the same company  even  after
         that  date.   He  took  me  through  the  documentary  evidence  to
         establish employment and referred to pay slips, P60s, letters  from
         the appellant's employer and  to  bank  statements  showing  salary
         deposits. He also referred me to evidence of employment in  respect
         of the appellant's former spouse in the form of national  insurance
         contributions, tax returns, letters from accountants and  financial
         accounts.  He  submitted  that  when  the  respondent  granted  the
         residence card in October 2014, she would have  had  to  have  been
         satisfied that the provisions of reg. 10 (6) and that the appellant
         had himself been exercising treaty rights as an  EEA  national.  He
         submitted that the evidence covered two years of marriage and three
         subsequent years and that the appeal should be allowed accordingly.



     12. Mr Tufan accepted there had  been  economic  activity  although  he
         observed that employment may have been marginal on the part of  the
         appellant's former spouse. Nevertheless, he accepted  the  evidence
         demonstrated economic activity and  that  the  appellant  had  been
         exercising treaty rights himself.



     13. Mr Dhanji had nothing further to add in response.



     14. At the conclusion of the hearing I reserved my determination  which
         I now give with reasons.



     15. Findings and Conclusions


     16. The respondent has properly conceded that Judge Keane made an error
         of law when assessing the evidence. It is plain that the judge  did
         not have regard to all the evidence and that he erred as claimed in
         the grounds. His decision is  consequently  flawed  and  I  set  it
         aside.



     17. I now consider the evidence. As agreed by the parties the appellant
         has to show that he has been residing here for a continuous  period
         of five years in accordance  with  the  Regulations.  The  relevant
         period is defined as January 2012 - January 2017.



     18.  Section  B  of  the  bundle  contains  the  following  documentary
         evidence:



    . payslips for the appellant covering the period of October 2014-January
      2017 (pp. 68-93)

    . Letter from employer dated 14 April 2015 confirming employment since 3
      December 2012 (p. 96). This is also in Section A (p. 33A)

    . P60s for the tax tears ending 2015 and 2016 (pp. 94-95)

    . Bank statements showing salary deposits for October 2014-January 2017
      (pp. 102-156)




     19. Section A contains the following evidence:


    . Letter from employer dated 25 January 2017 confirming employment since
      3 December 2012 (34A)
    . P60 for the tax year ending 2014 (35A)
    . Payslips covering January 2014 - April 2014 (35A-39A)
    . Bank statements showing salary deposits for January 2014-  April  2014
      (40A-44A).



     20. I am satisfied that these documents cover the period  from  January
         2014 until January 2017 inclusive.


     21. I turn next  to  the  earlier  period  during  the  course  of  the
         appellant's marriage. The evidence for this is contained in Section
         B:


    . Tax returns for the years ending 2010-2014 inclusive  (pp.  241,  269,
      273, 285 and 292)
    . Financial accounts for the tax year ending 2010-2014 (p. 227-240)
    . Letters from accountants dated 20 January 2014 and 29  September  2014
      covering her trading activities for 2012-2014 (pp. 225-226)
    . Payment of national insurance contributions for  2010-2014  (pp.  253-
      261).


     22. I am satisfied that this evidence covers the period from  2010-2014
         inclusive.


     23. It follows that the appellant has shown evidence to cover more than
         a five-year period and that certainly for the period  defined  from
         January 2012 - January 2017 employment and residence has been amply
         demonstrated.



     24. I also take account of the fact that when the respondent issued the
         last residence card in October 2014, she  was  satisfied  that  the
         appellant had shown retained rights of residence.



     25. I take note of Mr Tufan's observation that the  appellant's  former
         spouse's employment appeared to be marginal however that was not an
         issue taken by the respondent when the first  two  residence  cards
         were issued and  has  not  been  raised  as  part  of  the  current
         decision. I find that on the basis of the evidence before  me,  the
         provisions of reg. 15(1)(b) have been met.






     26. Decision


     27. The First-tier Tribunal made errors of law and  I  set  aside  that
         decision. I re-make the decision and allow the appeal under the EEA
         Regulations.



     28. Anonymity



     29. I was not asked to make an anonymity order and there is  no  reason
         to make one.

    Signed
