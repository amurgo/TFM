                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


      Introduction


      1.    The Appellant appealed with  permission  granted  by  First-tier
           Tribunal Judge Levin on 9 March 2015 against  the  determination
           of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  George  who  had  dismissed  the
           Appellant's appeal as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur).  The decision and
           reasons was promulgated on 19 January 2015.


      2.    The Appellant is a national of India, born  on  18  March  1988.
           Judge George  described  the  Appellant  as  an  impressive  and
           credible witness, and found that the Appellant  had  shown  that
           her occupation was as an IT Business Specialist at NQF level  6.
           The judge found that the Appellant had  met  Appendix  A,  Table
           4(d)(iv) of the Immigration  Rules:  see  [9]  to  [12]  of  the
           decision.  But the judge found at [15] of the same decision that
           the  Appellant  had  not  satisfied  the   regulated   financial
           institutions and disposable in the United  Kingdom  requirements
           of Appendix A.  The appeal was accordingly dismissed.


      3.    Permission to appeal was  granted  by  Judge  Levin  because  he
           considered that it was arguable that the judge had erred in that
           finding.  The Respondent had accepted  that  the  Appellant  had
           provided sufficient evidence to show that she had access  to  at
           least �50,000.  The judge's reasons for  dismissing  the  appeal
           were unclear and the Appellant could not know why she had lost.


      4.    Standard directions were made by the tribunal.  A rule 24 notice
           dated 17 March 2015 opposing the appeal had been  filed  on  the
           Respondent's behalf.  There it was stated  that  "Whilst  it  is
           accepted that [the Appellant] has funds in excess of �50k at the
           Punjab and Sindh Bank.  These funds are a fixed deposit and  not
           available until the maturity of the  deposit  which  would  have
           been after the date of the application." (sic).


      5.    In a response to the Respondent's rule 24 notice  dated  19  May
           2015, the Appellant submitted that the Respondent was attempting
           to resile from the position as to funds which had been  accepted
           in the reasons for refusal letter.




      Submissions - error of law


      6.    Mr Makol for the Appellant relied on the grounds of  onwards  of
           appeal and the grant of permission to appeal.  He submitted that
           the judge had reached erroneous findings as to the  funds.   The
           reason no points had been awarded for funds after the acceptance
           that funds  were  available  as  required  was  because  of  the
           occupation issue: see the section commencing (d)  in  the  first
           box (under Appendix A: Attributes) of the  reasons  for  refusal
           letter.  This was  why  no  points  had  been  awarded  for  the
           subsequent  boxes  in  the  letter,  "Funds  held  in  regulated
           financial institutions" and  "Funds  disposable  in  the  United
           Kingdom".  Because the judge had  resolved  that  issue  in  the
           Appellant's favour (see  [9]  to  [12]  of  the  decision),  the
           Appellant was entitled to points under all three sections: Table
           4(d)(iv) had been satisfied.  The  only  proper  conclusion  was
           that the appeal had to be allowed.


      7.    Ms Savage for the Respondent  relied  on  the  rule  24  notice,
           although candidly recognised that the reasons for refusal letter
           was not as clear as it might have been  and  that  the  rule  24
           notice was open to question.


      8.    There was nothing Mr Makol wished to add by way of reply


      9.    The tribunal indicated at the conclusion of submissions that  it
           found material errors of law, such that the decision and reasons
           had to be set aside in part.  The onwards  appeal  was  allowed.
           The tribunal's determination was reserved.




      Material error of law finding


      10.   The tribunal accepts  Mr  Makol's  submissions.   The  grant  of
           permission to appeal identified the material error of law.   The
           decision and reasons must have come as a  considerable  surprise
           to the Appellant and it is indeed true that the Appellant  would
           not have been able to understand why she  had  lost  her  appeal
           having succeeded on the only points in issue.  The decision  and
           reasons have been carefully prepared and the lack of clarity  in
           the reasons for refusal letter may go way towards explaining how
           the judge erred at [15] of the decision and reasons.


      11.   The Respondent's belated  attempt  to  modify  the  reasons  for
           refusal letter is mistaken and inadmissible.   As  a  matter  of
           simple banking law, repayment  of  a  fixed  deposit  cannot  be
           refused.  The consequence of early repayment is that interest is
           forfeited.  Thus the funds were correctly accepted as  available
           in the reasons for refusal letter.


      12.   The tribunal accordingly finds that there were  material  errors
           of law in the decision and reasons, requiring the decision to be
           remade.  No further submissions were required for that  purpose.
           Apart from the findings at [15], the other findings made by  the
           judge were clear and sustainable, and stand.  [15] must  however
           be set aside.  The decision and reasons must be  remade  in  the
           only manner possible, namely  that  the  Appellant's  appeal  is
           allowed because she satisfied Table 4(d)(iv) of  Appendix  A  of
           the Immigration Rules.
