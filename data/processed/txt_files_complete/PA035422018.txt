                       (anonymity direction not made)
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:     Mr S F Winter, Advocate, instructed by Katani & Co,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr A Govan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals  against  the  decision  of  FtT  Judge  Kempton,
    promulgated on 6 June 2018,  dismissing  his  appeal  to  the  FtT,  on
    grounds stated in his application filed on 20 June 2018.

 2. The grounds, in summary, are these:

      (1)  Error of law in relation to the  appellant's  practice  of  Falun
      Gong.

           (i) No finding, or no adequately explained finding,  on  whether
           the appellant practises Faun Gong, or on why he would not be  at
           real risk if he continues to do so.

           (ii)  Error at [26] in finding no independent  evidence  of  the
           appellant practising Falun  Gong,  when  there  was  independent
           evidence, from his partner.

           (iii) No reason, or no adequate reason, at [27] for finding that
           a letter confirming the appellant is being sought by the  police
           is a means to bolster his account.

           (iv)  At [20] - [21], error in noting that the appellant said  a
           discrepancy arose as he was nervous or under  pressure,  without
           explaining why that explanation was not reasonable.

      (2) Errors of law in relation to loan sharks, at [28].

           (i) Inconsistency with case law, by "failing to be slow to  draw
           adverse inferences" from failure by the appellant to mention his
           religion at screening interview.

           (ii)  No reasons, or inadequate  reasons,  for  finding  account
           about loan sharks not credible.

 3. Mr Govan conceded that the grounds disclosed error,  in  particular  at
    (1) (i), through failure to assess the sur place element of the  claim,
    and that a fresh hearing  was  required.   The  following  outcome  was
    agreed.

 4. The decision of the FtT is set aside, and stands only as  a  record  of
    what was said at the hearing.

 5. The nature of the case is such that it is appropriate under section  12
    of the 2007 Act, and under Practice Statement 7.2, to remit to the  FtT
    for an entirely fresh hearing.

 6. The member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case are not to include
    Judge Kempton.

 7. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
