Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr R Solomon, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against  the  decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge N  M  Paul  heard  at  Taylor  House  and
    promulgated on 16 September 2013.  The claimant is  a  citizen  of  Sri
    Lanka who first arrived in the United Kingdom as  a  Tier  4  (General)
    Student on 21 September 2010 with  entry  clearance  in  this  capacity
    until 7 January 2013.

2.   On 13 December 2012 he made an application for leave  to  remain  as  a
    partner of a person present and settled in the UK but this  application
    was then withdrawn. He then repeated the application on 4 January  2013
    and his application was refused on 20 March 2013.

3.   The reasons are given in the refusal letter.  In short these were  that
    the claimant had failed to meet the requirements for an  individual  to
    be granted leave to remain as a partner as outlined  in  R-LTRP  1.1(c)
    and (d) and that the requirements of E-LTRP 3.1 (a), (b)  and  (c)  had
    not been met. In particular that the evidence to show the gross  income
    had not been submitted and that there was no  evidence  of  savings  as
    required by subheading (b).

4.   The Secretary of State stated that although in his case he  had  stated
    that he and his partner have a joint income of ï¿½24,800 and had provided
    six months of payslips for both himself and his partner, the  partner's
    bank statements for the  last  six  months  showed  that  all  incoming
    payments on the statements had been paid in cash and did not correspond
    with the amount stated in the payslips.  No  evidence  of  savings  had
    been made in support of the application.  They therefore failed to meet
    the requirements of the paragraph.

5.   Furthermore, under the requirements of leave to remain under  paragraph
    EX1B family life it was noted that the applicant had to have a  genuine
    and subsisting relationship.  In this case although it was  noted  that
    the claimant was married to a British citizen he had failed to  provide
    evidence of the factors which would constitute insurmountable obstacles
    to family life with a partner continuing outside the United Kingdom.

6.   At the outset of the  appeal  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  as  is
    recorded in paragraph 7 Mr Solomon  then  appearing  for  the  claimant
    indicated that he had been in discussions with the  Presenting  Officer
    about the fact that the Secretary of State  had  apparently  failed  to
    consider Appendix FM-SE at paragraphs (e)  and  (f).   (e)  provided  a
    discretion  to  allow  alternative  documents  to  be  submitted.    He
    submitted to the First-tier Tribunal that the  position  was  that  the
    appellant only having less than six months left in his  visas  had  not
    been able to obtain a bank account and it followed therefore  that  the
    documentary evidence in relation to  his finances could not include the
    statement. However he had provided P60s for the end of his  employment.
    Similarly, while the appellant's wife had previously been paid  by  way
    of cash and therefore did not have payslips she nevertheless  had  bank
    statements which showed the payments into her account.

7.   At paragraph 7 of the decision letter the First-tier  Tribunal  records
    that Mr Solomon submitted (and the Presenting Officer did not disagree)
    that this was a case  where  the  Secretary  of  State  had  failed  to
    exercise discretion under Appendix  FM-SE  paragraph  (d).   The  short
    point that the Secretary of State sought to argue in  this  appeal  was
    that the Tribunal had  failed  to  properly  apply  the  provisions  of
    Appendix FM-SE, D, E and F. These are set out in the grounds of  appeal
    but in essence Mr Melvin submitted that in order  for  these  Rules  to
    apply there had to be a valid reason why a specified document cannot be
    supplied and that this was to be  exercised  in  unusual  or  at  least
    unique circumstances.

8.   Mr Solomon for the claimant submitted that there  was  indeed  a  valid
    reason and that had been conceded by the Secretary of State through the
    Home Office Presenting Officer and referred us to paragraph  7  of  the
    decision letter.

9.   In our opinion, while it is clear that  the  presiding  judge  was  led
    into error by the apparent agreement that the matter should go back  to
    the Secretary of State we do not consider that  paragraph  7  shows  an
    unequivocal acceptance by the Presenting Officer that there was a valid
    reason for the non-production of the specified evidence.

10.  Accordingly we  do  find  that  there  is  a  material  error  of  law.
    Furthermore we also consider that it was incumbent  on  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge to deal with the other  grounds  of  appeal  which  were
    before him and he failed to conclude that exercise.

11.  Accordingly we shall allow the appeal and remit back to the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge to redetermine the application.
