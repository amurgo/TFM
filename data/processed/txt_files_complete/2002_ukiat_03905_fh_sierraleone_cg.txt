                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


   1.  This  is  an  appeal  by  a  citizen  of  Sierra  Leone  against  the
      determination of an Adjudicator (Mr C J  Hodgkinson),  dismissing  her
      appeal on asylum and human rights grounds against the decision of  the
      Respondent on 11 January 2001 to give directions for removal to Sierra
      Leone.


   2. Before us, the Appellant was represented by Miss C Simpson  instructed
      by Kibedi & Co.  The Respondent was represented by Mr S Bilbe.


   3. There is no record of the Appellant's lawful  arrival  in  the  United
      Kingdom.  She claimed asylum on  9  January  2001  and  said  she  had
      arrived on 22 December 2000 by air in possession of a forged  passport
      arranged by an agent.  She said she had left Sierra Leone  in  mid-May
      2000 and  had  travelled  to  Guinea,  where  she  had  stayed  before
      travelling to the United Kingdom by air via Banjul (the capital of the
      Gambia).  She gave her last address in  Sierra  Leone  as  a  road  in
      Freetown.  The basis of her claim for  asylum  was  that,  in  January
      1999, following the rebel attack in Freetown, she was abducted by  the
      rebels and taken to the bush.   She  stayed  with  them  until  Ecomog
      forces freed her.  On returning to Freetown, she said she was  branded
      as  a  rebel  by  the  civilian  population  and  that  the   Kamajors
      continually harassed her.  The CIPU report  before  us  describes  the
      Kamajors as another  name  for  the  Civil  Defence  Forces  (CDF),  a
      coalition of militias that supports the government of Sierra Leone and
      is based on traditional hunting society.  The CDF are  normally  under
      military discipline and, although independant, are responsible to  the
      government.  The Appellant said she feared the rebels and the Kamajors
      and claimed that after "the May 2000 incident when  Foday  Sankoh  was
      arrested", anybody who  was  suspected  of  being  a  rebel  would  be
      harassed and arrested.  She said her home was visited and destroyed by
      the Kamajors.  Her father and brother were murdered; it was only  then
      she decided to flee from Sierra Leone.  She said there was no part  in
      Sierra Leone that was safe for her to live and that  the  rebels  were
      everywhere in Sierra Leone.  In the "further information"  section  of
      her statement of evidence form, she disclosed that she had been raped;
      that she no longer had any close relatives  to  live  with  in  Sierra
      Leone; that there are no  bright  prospects  for  a  young  girl  like
      herself in Sierra Leone, and that there is "every  likelihood  that  I
      will again be abducted and raped by the rebels".

   4. The Appellant gave evidence before the Adjudicator at the  hearing  of
      her appeal on 8 March 2002.  The Notice of Appeal to  the  Adjudicator
      had stated that the Appellant was HIV positive following her  rape  by
      rebel soldiers.  She was  pregnant,  traumatised  and  psychologically
      humiliated as a result of the rebels' actions.  There was  before  the
      Adjudicator a copy letter from Guys Hospital dated 15 June 2001.   Her
      representative  requested  an  adjournment  because  no  Home   Office
      Presenting  Officer  was  present,  and  because  the   representative
      understood that the Home Office had an HIV policy which might not have
      been considered.  Further, the representative said that the  Appellant
      had suffered significant psychological effects from learning that  she
      suffered from the HIV virus and it was desired to obtain a psychiatric
      report.  The Appellant had brought her child with her to the  hearing.
      The Adjudicator refused the request for an adjournment and said he did
      not consider a psychiatric report to be necessary, as he accepted that
      the Appellant would have suffered psychological trauma  from  learning
      that she had contracted the HIV virus.  The appeal proceeded  and  the
      Appellant gave evidence.

   5. In reaching  his  decision,  the  Adjudicator  noted  from  background
      evidence, that serious human rights violations by rebels in the  areas
      held by them and by the government-supporting CDF in government  areas
      continued.  Many of the violations were committed  with  impunity  and
      there were numerous  instances  of  sexual  assaults  by  the  Kamajor
      militia.  There were  citations  of  civilian  massacres  and  various
      abuses including the rape of  women.   Abduction  of  women  by  rebel
      forces was well documented.  There appeared to  be  little  government
      monitoring of human rights abuses.

   6. Against that background, the Adjudicator found the Appellant's account
      of her history of events as credible, and he accepted it.  He did  not
      regard credibility as an issue since the Respondent in the reasons for
      refusal letter "does not appear seriously to question the  Appellant's
      account  of  events".   The  Adjudicator  found,  however,  that   the
      Appellant had not shown that she would be at risk for a reason  within
      the Refugee Convention, if she were returned to Sierra Leone now.   He
      accepted that she had suffered significantly and was deemed  to  be  a
      collaborator following her release from rebel custody;  and  he  noted
      that her ill-treatment was not at  the  hands  of  government  forces.
      Although she had said that she had no home in Sierra Leone and that it
      would not be feasible for her to live in any government-held region of
      the country, the Adjudicator did not accept that she would be  at  any
      greater disadvantage if she were to be returned than any other citizen
      in a similar position.  She did not, therefore,  have  a  well-founded
      fear of persecution in Sierra Leone.  As to the  human  rights  claim,
      the Adjudicator noted that the Appellant  was  now  receiving  a  high
      standard of care for her HIV condition, which might not  be  available
      in other parts of  the  United  Kingdom.   There  was  no  documentary
      evidence before him regarding the availability of  treatment  for  HIV
      sufferers in Sierra Leone.  The Adjudicator assumed that, at the  very
      best, the level of medical care in Freetown was unlikely to  meet  the
      standard currently being received by the Appellant.  He noted that  in
      June 2001, the only treatment the Appellant was  receiving  was  folic
      acid while she was pregnant.  The HIV virus currently appeared  to  be
      well suppressed with no symptoms.  The Adjudicator was satisfied  that
      there were no substantial grounds for believing that there would be  a
      breach of  Article  3  or  any  other  article  of  the  Human  Rights
      Convention if the Appellant were to be returned to Sierra Leone at the
      present time.  He expressed his sympathy with her because of the  very
      traumatic events that had occurred in her life.

   7. The grounds of appeal to the Tribunal are carelessly and  repetitively
      drafted.  Ground 7 states: "The Special  Adjudicator  seemed  to  have
      concerned himself solely with the issue of the Appellant's  HIV  virus
      and failed to consider the important  issue  of  whether  or  not  the
      Appellant suffered harassment and persecution for a Convention  reason
      and whether or not her life would be in  danger  if  she  returned  to
      Sierra Leone."  The grounds  are  concerned  solely  with  the  asylum
      claim.  Despite that, Mrs Simpson indicated that she wished to address
      us on the medical aspects of the case.  Very properly, Mr  Bilbe,  for
      the Respondent, objected.  We indicated that we thought  it  right  to
      hear Mrs Simpson on the human rights aspect, although  we  acknowledge
      that our decision put Mr Bilbe  at  a  disadvantage  in  that  he  was
      clearly not prepared to deal with that aspect of the appeal.

   8. In relation to the asylum appeal, Miss Simpson drew our  attention  to
      passages in the US State Department report on human  rights  practices
      in 2001 of continuing human rights breaches.  The report states  that,
      unlike the previous year,  there  were  no  reports  that  SLA  forces
      committed extra-judicial killings; however, there  were  reports  that
      forces operating in support of the government committed such killings;
      reports in the  first  half  of  the  year  of  CDF  forces  summarily
      executing suspected rebels and rebel collaborators were  made  but  it
      was  difficult  to  gather  detailed  information  or  to  corroborate
      reports.    There   were   allegations   that   CDF   members   killed
      indiscriminately, resulting in civilian fatalities.  In June and July,
      RUF carried out retaliatory attacks against villagers  thought  to  be
      sympathetic to CDF.  There  were  credible  reports  that  CDF  forces
      operating on behalf  of  the  government  beat  and  otherwise  abused
      persons, and the government had not acted  to  curb  these  abuses  or
      punish those responsible.  Rebel forces used rape as a terror  tactic.
      Miss Simpson correctly submitted that it is imputed political  opinion
      which matters: The Appellant's claim was that she had been  persecuted
      because it was thought she was a rebel supporter.

   9. Mr Bilbe for the Respondent submitted that, contrary to  ground  7  of
      the grounds of appeal, the  Adjudicator  had  clearly  considered  the
      asylum claim: he had found at paragraphs 48 to 52 of the determination
      that the Appellant would not be at any greater disadvantage  than  any
      other citizen in a similar position if she were to  return  to  Sierra
      Leone.  The Appellant was not  a  CDF  member;  her  village  was  not
      sympathetic to CDF, so that extracts from the State Department  report
      to which we had been referred were irrelevant.  The report  showed  an
      improvement in the security situation, which was confirmed by the CIPU
      report.  Paragraph 4.31 reported an upsurge in violence  for  most  of
      the year 2000, but noted an improvement following the Abuja  ceasefire
      agreed in November 2000, so that rebel groups had shown  an  increased
      willingness to advance the peace process and  to  cooperate  with  the
      disarmament,   demobilisation   and   reintegration   process   (DDR).
      Paragraph 5.1 of the report, headed "Overview" stated:

        "The present Sierra Leonean government has generally respects (sic)
        human rights, and attempts to abide by the  safeguards  within  the
        Constitution.  Where these rights are curtailed, it is usually been
        (sic) because of security considerations, or because of a  lack  of
        funds or trained personnel  to  ensure  that  they  are  respected.
        However, the government appears to be responsive to representations
        made to it, and has attempted to address the issue of human rights,
        and abuses when these have been reported to it."

  10.  The  June  2002  CIPU  bulletin  on  Sierra   Leone   reported   that
      parliamentary and presidential elections were held on 14 May 2002  and
      were conducted in a peaceful  atmosphere,  with  a  few  incidents  of
      violence.  The elections appear to have been generally free and  fair.
      Opposition parties were considering their position  in  light  of  the
      results, and while they  had  expressed  reservations,  they  had  not
      formally  challenged  the  outcome.   Mr  Bilbe  submitted  that   the
      Adjudicator had considered the asylum claim, contrary to  the  grounds
      of appeal, and  that  the  evidence  showed  that  the  situation  was
      continuing to improve since his considerations.

  11. We accept Mr Bilbe's submission in relation to the asylum matter.  The
      current reports, to which we have referred, satisfy us that  there  is
      now a greatly improved security and human rights situation  in  Sierra
      Leone.  Whether or not the Appellant would, on return to that  country
      after her absence, be considered to be someone  who  had  collaborated
      with the rebels, we find that she fails to demonstrate that she  would
      be exposed to a real risk of persecution because of imputed  political
      opinion, or for any other reason within  the  United  Nations  Refugee
      Convention, or that the authorities would be unable and  unwilling  to
      offer protection to her.  We agree with the Adjudicator's conclusion.

  12. As to the human rights claim,  Miss  Simpson  drew  our  attention  to
      various documents, including a statement of Home Office policy on HIV,
      a Foreign and Commonwealth  Office  report  from  Freetown,  dated  19
      November 2001 and a paper by  the  Terence  Higgins  Trust.   We  have
      considered these documents, but in our judgement, the  most  important
      document before us is an up to date medical report by the  Appellant's
      Consultant Physician at Guys and St Thomas' Hospital  Trust  dated  27
      May 2002.   The  report  states  that  the  Appellant  received  anti-
      retroviral therapy in pregnancy,  which  was  discontinued  after  the
      pregnancy as her own surrogate markers were good.  The  baby  is  well
      and HIV negative.

  13. The report describes the  Appellant's  blood  test  results  as  "very
      favourable" and states  that  she  does  not  require  anti-retroviral
      therapy for herself at the present time.  The report states:

        "With regard to her prognosis, it is always difficult to comment on
        how long somebody will remain well, but in view  of  her  good  CD4
        count reflecting a healthy immune system and a low viral load,  she
        should not require any retroviral therapy in the  immediate  future
        and should remain well for several years.  There will come a  point
        after a variable period of time that the CD4 count declines and the
        viral load increases.  This varies from patient to  patient,  which
        is why we monitor people every three or four months to  check  that
        all is well.  At some point, her results will change and  she  will
        require anti-retroviral therapy."

      The Consultant goes on to state that he does not have specific details
      on the availability of anti-retroviral therapy and HIV care in  Sierra
      Leone.  A copy letter from the Entry Clearance Manager at the  British
      High Commission in Freetown dated 19 November 2001 is included in  the
      Appellant's bundle.  It states that there are no anti-retroviral drugs
      programmes in Sierra Leone.  The  Ministry  of  Health  runs  an  Aids
      control programme and provides symptomatic  management  and  treatment
      for some of the opportunistic infections associated with Aids.   Viral
      and CD4 count tests are not available in laboratories in Sierra Leone.
       Symptomatic management of patients will cost about �15 monthly (which
      is clearly very high by  local  standards).   Being  an  HIV  positive
      patient in  Sierra  Leone  carries  some  element  of  stigmatisation,
      discrimination and sometimes isolation.  Some communities  and  family
      units are supportive and caring towards HIV and Aids patients.

  14. In his submissions, Mr Bilbe for the Secretary of State  asked  us  to
      note that no formal request had ever been made for the Home Office  to
      consider this aspect of the case; the  grounds  of  appeal,  far  from
      stressing the point, complain that the Adjudicator had spent too  much
      time on the HIV issue.

  15. We have considered this aspect of the appeal with  some  concern.   We
      acknowledge that facilities for treatment in  Sierra  Leone  are  less
      satisfactory than in this country.  On the  other  hand,  the  medical
      report as to the Appellant's current position (and that of her  child)
      is happily so favourable that she does not  currently  need  treatment
      and it is speculative at what stage treatment may  be  desirable.   In
      these circumstances, we are unable to accept Miss Simpson's submission
      that the Appellant's return to Sierra Leone would expose her to a real
      risk of breach of her protected human rights under Article  3  or  any
      other article of the European Convention on Human Rights.

  16. The appeal is dismissed.
