                       (ANONYMITY DIRECTION NOT MADE)
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms Natalie Wilkins of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr A Tan, a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                     REASONS FOR FINDING AN ERROR OF LAW

1.   The appellant is a citizen of Iran born on  31st  December,  1964.   He
    has a lengthy immigration history.  He made application for recognition
    as a refugee and his claim was rejected by the Secretary of State.

2.   The appellant subsequently appealed and his appeal came  before  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Mark Davies sitting at Manchester  on  27th  March,
    2017.  The judge dismissed the appellant's appeal on asylum grounds and
    on human rights grounds.  Unfortunately, there are material  errors  of
    law in Judge Davies' determination and both Mr Tan and Ms Wilkins  were
    agreed that the determination could not stand.

3.   I agree with them.  Apart from anything else, the judge failed to  make
    any findings on the new evidence presented to  him,  namely,  that  men
    connected to Sepah were in fact subsequently  prosecuted,  and  medical
    evidence which it is claimed suggests that the appellant is at risk  of
    suicide on return.  The failure to consider these matters  is  a  clear
    error of law.  There are others.

4.   The determination is set aside in its entirety.  The appellant has  not
    had the benefit of a fair hearing and  the  matter  will  therefore  be
    remitted to be heard afresh by a  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal,
    other than First Tier Tribunal Judge Mark Davies.  A Farsi  interpreter
    will be required.  Four hours was last allowed for the hearing  of  the
    appeal.  There are potentially  8  [eight]  witnesses  and  four  hours
    should be allowed for the hearing of the appeal.
