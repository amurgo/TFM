                              MR FAWAD MUHAMMAD
                        (ANONYMITY DIRECTION NOT MADE)

                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent

For the Respondent:    Mrs R Pettersen (Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. This is an appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal,  with  permission,  by  the
      Appellant in relation to a Decision  and  Reasons  of  the  First-tier
      Tribunal (Judge Hudson) promulgated on 23rd February 2016 by which she
      dismissed the Appellant's appeal  against  the  Secretary  of  State's
      decision to refuse to issue him with a Residence card as  an  extended
      family member of an EEA national exercising Treaty Rights in the UK.


   2. Permission to appeal was granted on 8th August 2016.


   3. However on 19th  September  2016  the  Upper  Tribunal  published  its
      decision in Sala (EFMs: Right of Appeal) [2016] UKUT 00411 (IAC) which
      found that extended family members have no  right  of  appeal  to  the
      First-tier Tribunal.

   4. I was somewhat surprised that, in light of Sala, Mr Khan pursued  this
      matter.  However  he  did.   He  also  submitted  a  small  bundle  of
      additional evidence explaining that, since the  First-tier  Tribunal's
      decision, the situation had altered in  that  the  Appellant  and  his
      partner were now  married.   That  is  of  course  irrelevant  to  the
      decision made by the First-tier Tribunal in this case.  The First-tier
      Tribunal was deciding an application by an extended family member.  If
      the Appellant is now a family member the appropriate course is a fresh
      application under the EEA Regulations.

   5. In light of Sala and in line with it I find as follows:

   6. The Appellant has no right of appeal.  The First-tier Tribunal had  no
      jurisdiction to hear the appeal.  It erred in law in doing so.

   7. I set aside its decision and substitute a decision that there was  not
      a valid appeal before the First-tier Tribunal.
