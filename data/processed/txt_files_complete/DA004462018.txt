For the Appellant:     Mr Ell, instructed by Turpin & Miller
For the Respondent:    Mr Mills, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant was born on 18 July 1988 and is a citizen  of  Lithuania.
    On 17 December 2017, the appellant was convicted of  causing  death  by
    careless  or  inconsiderate  driving  and  was  sentenced   12   months
    imprisonment and ordered to pay a victim surcharge of ï¿½140. On  30  May
    2018, the Secretary  of  State  decided  to  deport  the  appellant  to
    Lithuania. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal which,  in
    a decision promulgated on 23 October 2018, dismissed  his  appeal.  The
    appellant now appeals, with permission, to the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The appellant claims to have entered the  United  Kingdom  in  February
    2016. He has a partner, also a Lithuanian citizen, with whom  he  lives
    in the United Kingdom together with her daughter aged 8 years and their
    own child was born in August 2018.

 3. The appellant fell to be considered under regulations 23(6)(b)  and  27
    of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016:

         23

         (6) Subject to paragraphs (7) and (8),  an  EEA  national  who  has
         entered the United Kingdom or the family member of such a  national
         who has entered the United Kingdom may be removed if-

         ...

         (b) the Secretary of State has decided that the person's removal is
         justified on grounds of public policy, public  security  or  public
         health in accordance with regulation 27;

         (5) The public policy  and  public  security  requirements  of  the
         United Kingdom include restricting rights  otherwise  conferred  by
         these Regulations in order to protect the fundamental interests  of
         society, and where a relevant  decision  is  taken  on  grounds  of
         public  policy  or  public  security  it  must  also  be  taken  in
         accordance with the following principles-




         27(5)

         (a) the decision must comply with the principle of proportionality;

         (b) the decision must be based exclusively on the personal  conduct
         of the person concerned;

         (c) the personal conduct of the person must  represent  a  genuine,
         present and  sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting  one  of  the
         fundamental interests of society, taking into account past  conduct
         of the person and that the threat does not need to be imminent;

         (d) matters isolated from the particulars  of  the  case  or  which
         relate to considerations of general prevention do not  justify  the
         decision;

         (e) a person's previous criminal convictions do not  in  themselves
         justify the decision;

         (f) the decision may be taken on preventative grounds, even in  the
         absence of a previous criminal conviction, provided the grounds are
         specific to the person.

         (6) Before taking a relevant decision  on  the  grounds  of  public
         policy and public security in relation to a  person  ("P")  who  is
         resident in the  United  Kingdom,  the  decision  maker  must  take
         account of considerations such as the age, state of health,  family
         and economic situation of P, P's length of residence in the  United
         Kingdom, P's  social  and  cultural  integration  into  the  United
         Kingdom and the extent of P's links with P's country of origin.

    The Burden of Proof

 4. The appellant challenges the judge's decision on  the  basis  that  she
    applied the burden of proof incorrectly. At [18], the judge  refers  to
    the skeleton argument submitted on behalf of the appellant, noting that
    this document asserted that, 'the burden was on the  respondent  proved
    that the appellant represented a genuine common  present  a  sufficient
    threat to one of the fundamental interests of society.'  At  [19],  she
    recorded that, 'in a written submission [the Presenting Officer] argued
    that the burden of proof was on the  appellant.  He  provided  relevant
    case law.' The 'relevant case law' is not specified.

 5. Before the Upper Tribunal, both  parties  agreed  that,  following  the
    authority of Arranz (EEA Regulations - deportation - test) [2017]  UKUT
    294 (IAC), the burden of proving that a person  represents  a  genuine,
    present and sufficient threat rests on the Secretary  of  State.  Faced
    with a conflict between the submissions of the representatives at  [18]
    and [19], the judge did nothing to resolve it. Mr Mills,  who  appeared
    for the Secretary of State before the Upper Tribunal,  argued  that  it
    was possible to 'read into' the judge's analysis an understanding  that
    she had correctly placed the burden of proof on the Secretary of State.
    I disagree. Whilst  the  judge  does  not  refer  either  party  having
    discharged or failed to discharge the burden of proof in  her  analysis
    at [31] et seq, I do not consider that it should  be  necessary  for  a
    reader of a decision to assume that  the  judge,  faced  with  a  clear
    conflict as to the proper  application  of  the  law,  has  necessarily
    adopted the correct course of action. The judge's lack of  clarity  has
    led her into legal error.

    The Judge's Analysis of the Evidence.

 6. Given that I find that the judge's decision must be set  aside  because
    of her failure to resolve the  proper  application  of  the  burden  of
    proof, I shall deal with the remaining grounds briefly. I agree with Mr
    Ell, who appeared for the appellant both Tribunals, that  at  [36]  the
    judge  has  misrepresented  the  evidence  concerning  the  appellant's
    response to his offence. The judge only states that the  appellant  had
    referred to the offence as a 'mistake.' She goes on to say that,  'this
    not only minimises what he did but in my view demonstrates  a  lack  of
    understanding of the seriousness of his  behaviour.  Conceding  mistake
    does not in my view amount to conceding culpability.' The circumstances
    of the  offence  were  unusual.  The  Crown  Court  accepted  that  the
    appellant had not been aware that he had struck anyone with  his  motor
    vehicle although the judge did comment that,  had  the  appellant  been
    paying attention, the  accident  might  have  been  avoided.  When  the
    accident was  eventually  brought  to  the  appellant's  attention,  he
    pleaded guilty immediately. I consider that it was  necessary  for  the
    judge  to  analyse  the  sentencing  remarks  and  the  other  evidence
    regarding the appellant's response to the accident more thoroughly. Her
    analysis fails to give a proper account of the evidence and it arguably
    tainted her assessment of the appellant as posing a present threat.

    Article 8 ECHR/Proportionality

 7. The judge notes that the appellant has a partner, a natural child and a
    stepchild living with him in the United  Kingdom.  However,  the  judge
    fails to take account of the circumstances of the family  in  assessing
    proportionality. At [31], she characterises the  appellant  as  if  you
    were a single man without dependants. Article 8 ECHR, although pleaded,
    receives no mention at all.

 8. The judge erred in law for the reasons which I have given above. I find
    that her decision should be set aside. None of  the  findings  of  fact
    shall stand. There will need to be  a  de  novo  fact-finding  exercise
    which is better conducted in the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  which  this
    appeal is returned for that Tribunal to remake the decision

Notice of Decision

 9. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal promulgated on 23 October  2018
    is set aside. None of the findings of fact shall stand. The  appeal  is
    returned to the First-tier Tribunal (not Judge Pacey) for that Tribunal
    to remake the decision.
