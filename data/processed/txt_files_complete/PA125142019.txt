Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms S Walker, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Ms J Isherwood, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals against the First-tier Tribunal's decision  which
    dismissed her appeal against the Secretary of State's decision on  30th
    November 2019 to refuse her asylum, humanitarian protection  and  human
    rights claim under  the  European  Convention  of  Human  Rights.   The
    grounds of appeal set out that the appellant was from  Thailand  and  a
    transgender  woman.   It  was  accepted  that  she  was  a  victim   of
    trafficking with a positive conclusive grounds decision  and  that  she
    was in a relationship with a British citizen.  On  14th  December  2016
    the appellant had claimed to be a victim of trafficking.

 2. The grounds of appeal against the First-tier Tribunal decision set  out
    the appellant's history and that she  had  travelled  to  South  Africa
    where she stayed for three or four years to work in the sex  trade  and
    when she returned to Thailand  she  was  attacked  by  her  father  and
    stabbed with a broken bottle leaving scarring and  broken  bones.   Her
    account of being attacked by her father was rejected by the Home Office
    but accepted by the First-tier Tribunal who found  the  medical  report
    produced was "supportive of her account of being attacked by her father
    in the past" (paragraph 29).

 3. Her travel to the United Kingdom was arranged by someone called  K  who
    also arranged her travel to  South  Africa.   She  was  loaned  �32,000
    (which she has since repaid) to  pay  for  her  travel  to  the  United
    Kingdom and she entered the UK in 2012 with a  transit  visa,  remained
    and had worked in the sex trade as an escort.

    The grounds for permission to appeal.

 4. There were three grounds of application.

    Ground 1.

 5. At paragraph 25 of the decision, the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  placed
    weight on the Country Information Note on Thailand, dated 24th  October
    2019, citing the  Borgen  Report  that  there   had  been  progress  in
    reducing  human  trafficking  and  the  Judge  found  that  "the   Thai
    government had made  significant  efforts  to  eliminate  trafficking".
    That sufficed for the  judge  to  find  that  the  situation  was  much
    improved.   That  finding,  however,  was  not  properly  reasoned  and
    appeared to depart from the country guidance of AZ  (Trafficked  Women)
    Thailand CG [2010] UKUT 118 and ran counter to settled  law  that  very
    clear and cogent reasons needed to be given for departing from  country
    guidance.

 6. The First-tier Tribunal made no reference to the  2019  Trafficking  in
    Persons Report provided at A/ B 194 and referred to in written and oral
    submissions and which identified that Thailand remained on the  Tier  2
    watch list; this was the same designation it had  when  AZ  (Trafficked
    Women) Thailand CG was decided.  This indicated that the situation  was
    not "much improved".

 7. The judge did not explain why the Country Information Note on  Thailand
    was preferred to the 2019 Trafficking Report or explain why less weight
    was placed on  this  report  before  finding  "the  situation  is  much
    improved from 2010" at paragraph 25.  The failure to do so amounted  to
    an error of law.

 8. At paragraph 26 the judge noted a clear example of progress since 2010,
    namely that the government was providing victims  of  trafficking  with
    assistance and accommodation,  education  and  finding  employment  and
    financial aid.  The judge did not cite objective evidence as the  basis
    for this but rather tracked the Country Information Note cited  in  the
    refusal letter.  As a transgender woman the appellant would not be able
    to avail herself of shelters provided  by  the  government  because  as
    recorded in the submissions "shelters for victims  of  trafficking  did
    not provide specialised care to boys and LGBTI victims and in  addition
    authorities required transgender victims to stay in shelters  based  on
    their sex assigned at birth".  As a transwoman the appellant would  not
    be able to access the government shelters.  The judge erred in  failing
    to consider the significant objective evidence.

 9. Furthermore, at paragraph 26, the judge  found  that  in  Bangkok  "the
    transgender community is thriving and would offer support".  The  judge
    did not set out the objective evidence relied upon that the transgender
    community in Bangkok provided support to victims of  trafficking.   The
    refusal letter set out that Bangkok was fairly tolerant and there was a
    welcoming nightlife but it was not argued by the respondent  that  such
    entertainment amounted to a protective factor.

10. At paragraph 27 the judge adopted the findings of  the  Borgen  Project
    set out in the refusal letter at paragraph 10  that  "most  trafficking
    cases are  facilitated  by  individual  and  local  level  networks  of
    friends,  family  members  and  former  victims"  and  found  that  the
    appellant would be unlikely to be re-trafficked but did not  go  on  to
    consider whether she  would  be  re-trafficked  by  a  new  network  of
    traffickers given that she has previously been trafficked.

11. Such errors were  material and in particular  it  was  noted  that  the
    appellant was unmarried, her domestic background was  that  her  father
    had been violent towards her,  she  had  a  college  education  but  no
    professional experience having only ever worked as a sex worker and she
    would not be able to access government sanctioned shelters.

    Ground 2

12. This asserted that the judge had erred in failing to take into  account
    material evidence of fact when considering whether her removal breached
    her Article 8 rights.

13. The judge considered that she was not in  a  genuine  relationship  but
    placed little weight on BH's mother's evidence.  Her evidence  was  not
    such that the appellant had only met her once  and  the  letter  stated
    "they invited A 'to come over Christmas 2018 and  from  then  till  now
    some time she came over to visit and stayed  with  us  too'".   It  was
    evident that she had met the mother more than once.   The  judge  noted
    that the statement was littered with grammatical  and  spelling  errors
    and that the mother could have given  evidence  by  Skype  as  she  was
    unable to attend in person but placed less weight on the  letter  given
    by the mother due to the failure of her to apply to  give  evidence  by
    Skype and as it was unlikely such an  application  would  be  fruitful;
    that amounted to unfairness.

14. The judge  made  no  reference  to  the  extensive  evidence  that  the
    appellant and BH wanted to marry but were unable to do so as  they  did
    not have a certificate copy of her passport.

15. The judge made no reference to the appellant's  bank  statements  which
    featured both the appellant's name and Mr BH's name and that they  were
    living in Huntingdon, rather the judge placed weight on the absence  of
    photographs.  Photographs were  provided  to  the  respondent  and  the
    appellant was no longer in possession of them but the judge's  concerns
    were not raised with the appellant which was a breach of the  principle
    of procedural fairness.

    Ground 3.

16. The judge made a material error by finding that the appellant  and  her
    fianc� were dishonest when they told the Tribunal  that  their  letting
    agency knew they were living together in the property.  The judge at 33
    stated:

         "The letting agency would open itself up to difficulties if it were
         to permit an illegal entrant to the UK  to  rent  a  property.   An
         agency would be well  aware  of  the  ramifications  of  permitting
         someone to live at the property in breach  of  this  clause.   This
         evidence was clearly a lie by the appellant".

    Similarly, the evidence of Mr BH was rejected as he  told  the  letting
    agency that she would be living with him.  At  paragraph  34  that  was
    found not to be credible.

17. The court had repeatedly urged the Tribunal to take care when making  a
    finding of deliberate dishonesty,  the  Shen  (Paper  appeals;  proving
    dishonesty) [2014] UKUT 236 (IAC).

18. Both the appellant and her partner stated that they  had  informed  the
    letting agency that they were living together in the apartment and this
    was not a matter raised by the respondent in the  refusal  letter,  nor
    did the judge indicate during the hearing she was concerned  that  this
    evidence was not truthful.  By not  providing  the  appellant  with  an
    opportunity to provide further oral evidence the judge made a  material
    error of law.

    Grant of Permission

19. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Keki?  stating
    when finding the availability of Thai government support to victims  of
    trafficking the judge arguably erred in failing to have regard  to  the
    fact that the individuals have to stay in shelters of the sex  assigned
    to them  at  birth  and  that  the  judge  arguably  departed  from  AZ
    (Trafficked Women) without giving  clear  reasons  and  she  failed  to
    consider the 2019 Trafficking in Persons  Report  which  had  indicated
    that Thailand had the same designation as  in  AZ  (Trafficked  Women),
    that is Tier 2 watch list.  Judge Keki? also found that it was arguable
    the judge failed to consider  the  relevant  factors  set  out  in  the
    grounds.

    The Hearing

20. At the hearing before me Ms Walker expanded on her written  submissions
    advancing that although the judge addressed AZ (Trafficked Women),  she
    did not consider the relevant factors.  In  particular,  there  was  no
    evidence cited that transgender issue had been taken into account  when
    considering the government shelters' availability.  In sum,  a  careful
    examination of the material factors had not been undertaken.  The judge
    had stated the appellant would be able to find work  but  although  she
    was college educated she had been hitherto a sex worker and it was  not
    clear on what basis that she could draw on a  professional  background.
    Nor was her domestic and violent background drawn  into  the  analysis.
    She could receive only very limited support from the mother.

21. In relation to Article 8, in particular at paragraph 32, no weight  had
    been placed on the letter from the mother but at that particular  point
    the video Skype facilities were not generally available and it had been
    drawn to the Tribunal's attention that the mother was ill  herself  and
    unable to attend court.  The spelling errors  in  the  mother's  letter
    should not be considered to be relevant, although  Ms  Walker  accepted
    that there was no medical evidence that the  appellant's  mother  could
    not come to court because of  the  responsibilities  she  had  for  her
    husband who was disabled.  Nor was any consideration made by the  judge
    of the efforts the couple had made to marry and their  bank  statements
    and plane tickets.  Although there was a lack of photographs there  was
    reference to photographs in the bundle.

22. In relation to findings of dishonesty very careful steps needed  to  be
    taken to the court when a finding of dishonesty was made.

23. Ms Isherwood submitted that there was no material error  of  law.   She
    argued that there was a lack of detail in support of  the  relationship
    and none of the witnesses had attended court.  They had said that  they
    were a couple but the appellant and her said partner had  continued  to
    live in a property claiming a single person's discount and that  was  a
    clear case of dishonesty.

24. In relation to ground 1 the bulk of Ms Walker's submissions  were  made
    in relation to the fact that Thailand remained in the Tier 2  watch  as
    far as trafficking was concerned but  there  was  clear  evidence  that
    Thailand was undertaking various improvements and making an  effort  to
    assist victims of trafficking.  Ms Isherwood stated that paragraphs 24,
    25 and 26 looked at the individual factors  in  relation  to  the  Thai
    government's efforts and the relevant factors of  the  appellant.   The
    judge acknowledged that there was a Gender Equality Act and stated that
    it was "not impossible to find work".  At paragraph 28 the judge  found
    clearly that the appellant was able to  relocate  to  Bangkok  and  the
    father was not looking for her and therefore there would be no interest
    from the traffickers in her.

Analysis

25. Unfortunately Ms Isherwood was hampered by her inability to access  the
    paper file but the appellant's representative's skeleton  argument  for
    the First-tier Tribunal was in the file before the court.

26. As the judge indicated at paragraph 3 of her decision  the  appellant's
    claim was that she had a well-founded fear of persecution  in  Thailand
    on the basis of her membership of a particular social group, namely  as
    a  transgender  woman.   The  appellant   also   claimed   humanitarian
    protection and maintained her rights under Articles 2, 3, 4  and  8  of
    the European Convention on  Human  Rights  would  be  breached  if  she
    returned to Thailand.  At paragraph 23 the judge stated that  the  real
    question to determine is whether the appellant had shown that there was
    a real risk of persecution  for  the  appellant  as  a  result  of  her
    transgender status if she were returned to Thailand?

27. That real question was not addressed by the Judge. Although it was  not
    challenged in specific terms, the failure to  address  that  issue  was
    relevant to the findings made by the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  when
    applying AZ (Trafficked Women) Thailand CG.  As found in AZ (Trafficked
    Women) not all will be at risk of serious harm on return and  the  risk
    would depend on a number of factors which must be assessed on a case by
    case basis.  "Relevant factors will include the  age,  marital  status,
    domestic  background,  educational  level,  qualifications   and   work
    experience of the appellant.  The  availability  of  employment  and  a
    familial or other support network will also  be  significant  factors".
    Various factors relating thereto were set out in the skeleton  argument
    on behalf of the appellant before the First-tier Tribunal.

28. I am not persuaded that the judge  failed  to  take  into  account  the
    country guidance that has been promulgated  since  2010  including  the
    Country Information Note on Thailand: Trafficking  dated  24th  October
    2019 and the US State Department Trafficking in Persons Report 2019  in
    support of the finding that "the Thai government has  made  significant
    efforts to  eliminate  trafficking"  at  paragraph  25,  because  those
    reports do  identify  that  the  situation  has  changed,  albeit  that
    Thailand remains in the Tier 2 watch category.  The judge, however, did
    not enlist all  material relevant factors in the analysis.

29. The judge's failure to address clearly the ground in  relation  to  the
    appellant's transgender status was one of the factors that was relevant
    in  two  differing  ways,  that  is  discrimination  for   example   in
    employment, and access to  protective  shelter.  When  the  judge  made
    findings at paragraph 26 in relation to the transgender  point  it  was
    merely stated:

         "I am conscious that transgender  people  still  suffer  from  some
         discrimination although in 2015 legislation was passed  to  prevent
         this (Gender Equality Act) which shows a positive move in the right
         direction.  I am not told that it is  impossible  for  an  educated
         healthy transgender adult to work".

30. This does not actually address and make a finding on discrimination  or
    the level of discrimination that the appellant might experience.   Even
    if  the  discrimination   was   insufficient   cumulatively   to   find
    persecution, the judge was obliged to make a finding  in  that  regard.
    Nor does the judge make a clear finding  in  relation  to  whether  the
    appellant could find work.

31. Further, as Ms Walker pointed out the high point of her case  was  that
    the judge relied on the finding that:

         "The government provides victims of trafficking with assistance and
         accommodation, education and finding employment and financial  aid.
         With such support available to her, I  find  this  will  provide  a
         protective factor, particularly if she were return to Bangkok, away
         from her province of Lampang from where she was  trafficked,  where
         the transgender community is thriving and would offer support".

32. The judge however failed to address the relevant points that  were  set
    out in the appellant's  skeleton  argument  such  as  that  transgender
    people could not change their legal gender and same-sex marriages  were
    not legal. The inability to change legal gender was relevant.

33. The Trafficking in Persons Report 2019 by the US  Department  of  State
    found that:

         "The shelters provided by Ministry of Social Development and  Human
         Security ............ shelters for victims of trafficking  did  not
         provide specialised care to boys and  LGBTI  victims;  in  addition
         authorities require transgender victims to stay in  shelters  based
         on their sex assigned at birth".

34. As the skeleton argument pointed out, the legal gender  recognition  in
    Thailand (a legal policy and review) states that "as it  is  impossible
    for a transgender person to amend the gender marker or  name  title  on
    those documents, passports too are based on a transgender person's  sex
    assigned at birth rather than their gender identity".

35. The skeleton argument of Ms  Walker  had  added  that  in  relation  to
    persecution less overt measures may suffice such as the

         "Imposition of serious economic disadvantage, denial of  access  to
         employment,  to  the  professions,  or  to   education   or   other
         restrictions  on  the  freedoms  traditionally  guaranteed   in   a
         democratic society ... Although mere discrimination is probably not
         enough  evidence  of  discrimination  will  make   it   easier   to
         demonstrate persecution".

36. The judge therefore, when finding that a shelter would be available for
    the appellant in Bangkok where the  judge  found  she  could  relocate,
    omitted to address a key plank of the  argument  raised  regarding  her
    transgender status and failed to acknowledge that the appellant may not
    be able to access a shelter, or may  be  discriminated  against  in  an
    'assigned shelter' and may be unable to access further services.

37. This was a material error of law.

38. In relation to Article 8 I am not persuaded that the judge erred in the
    approach to the witness statements or credibility of the appellant  and
    Mr BH when considering the tenancy agreement.

39. It was open to the Judge to criticise the evidence of  BH's  mother  as
    she failed to attend.  Indeed, Ms Walker accepted  that  there  was  no
    medical evidence before the Tribunal to  the  effect  that  the  mother
    could not attend.  The judge also pointed out that she referred to  the
    relationship as 'general' rather than 'genuine' although  poor  grammar
    and spelling mistakes should not necessarily be held against a witness.
      The appellant would have been aware of the lack of photographs and it
    was open to the appellant to explain that absence  during  the  hearing
    without prompting from the judge.

40. As the judge stated, she did not accept that the appellant had informed
    the letting agency that she did not  have  identity  documents  and  no
    certified copy of her passport and they were content to permit  her  to
    live there.  The judge rightly pointed  out  the  difficulties  that  a
    letting agency would expose itself to if it were to permit  an  illegal
    entrant to the UK to rent a property.  Further, the  tenancy  agreement
    made it clear at 8.5.1 that the  premises  could  not  be  shared  with
    anyone other than the tenant without  the  landlord's  written  consent
    which had not been obtained.  As the judge stated "an agency  would  be
    well aware of the ramifications of permitting someone to  live  at  the
    property in breach of this clause.  This evidence was clearly a lie  by
    the appellant".

41. The judge also noted that the appellant's said partner, Mr BH "went  on
    to accept that he had falsely claimed a  single  person's  council  tax
    discount and had told the council that he was living  alone.   He  then
    went on to state that he had told the council that the appellant  lived
    there when he was on nightshift".  The judge stated "I do not find that
    to be likely or honest evidence".  It was open to  the  judge  to  find
    that Mr BH was claiming a 25% discount from the council  on  the  basis
    that he was either lying to the council or  effectively  lying  to  the
    Tribunal. In my view, it was open to the judge to find that she was not
    persuaded by the relationship bearing in  mind  the  lack  of  evidence
    which was highlighted in the refusal letter.

42. Nonetheless, on the  basis  that  the  protection  claim  findings  are
    unsound this may well have an impact on the  Article  8  findings  and,
    owing to the reasons for rejecting the mother's evidence, it  may  well
    be that she is able to attend a further hearing remotely.  I  therefore
    set this decision aside.  I preserve none of the findings and remit the
    matter to the First-tier Tribunal for a hearing de novo.
43. The Judge erred materially for the reasons identified. I set aside  the
    decision pursuant to Section  12(2)(a)  of  the  Tribunals  Courts  and
    Enforcement Act 2007 (TCE 2007).  Bearing in mind the nature and extent
    of the findings to be made the matter should be remitted to the  First-
    tier Tribunal under section 12(2) (b) (i) of the TCE 2007  and  further
    to 7.2 (b) of the Presidential Practice Statement.
