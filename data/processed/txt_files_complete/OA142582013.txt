Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr E Tufan, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr S Ell, Counsel


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant in this case is the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department.  However, for the sake of clarity, I shall use  the  titles
    by which the parties were known before the First-tier Tribunal with the
    Secretary of State referred to "the respondent" and  Mrs  Chowdhury  as
    "the appellant".

 2.  No  application  for  anonymity  had  been  made  hitherto  in   these
    proceedings and there is no reason why such an order should be made.

 3. The appellant, is a citizen of Bangladesh  born  14  April  1988.   She
    applied for leave to  enter  the  United  Kingdom  as  a  spouse.   The
    respondent  considered  the  application  under  Appendix  FM  of   the
    Immigration Rules HC 395 (as amended).  On 3 June 2013  the  respondent
    refused leave resulting in an appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.   That
    was heard by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Maxwell who in a decision
    promulgated on 3 December 2014 allowed it under the Immigration  Rules.



 4. The refusal was because the  respondent  was  not  satisfied  with  the
    appellant's claim that her partner earned �19,000 per  annum  from  his
    employment by Gold Menu  Restaurant  and  that  his  earnings  for  the
    relevant period had been checked out by HMRC showing an  annual  income
    of only �10,419.  Investigations relating to  the  appellant's  English
    language test proved that the documents relied on  were  not  reliable.
    However, at the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal Judge  the  HOPO
    was, as the judge says at paragraph 6 of his decision:-

         "... placed in the difficult position of having to accept that  the
         checks made with HMRC had been wholly misinterpreted and  that  the
         figures cited by the Entry Clearance Officer  related  to  the  net
         income and  not  the  gross  income  of  the  appellant's  partner.
         Despite the fact that there is clear evidence of the sponsor having
         earned in excess of the minimum �18,600  required,  the  respondent
         nevertheless maintained that the appellant failed to prove, on  the
         balance  of  probabilities,  that  her  partner  was  employed   as
         claimed."

 5. This became the only issue for the  judge  as  at  the  outset  of  the
    hearing in the First-tier the HOPO indicated that the issue relating to
    the English language certificate was no longer in  play  and  that  the
    sole ground of refusal was whether or not the appellant's  sponsor  was
    employed as claimed.

 6. Judge Maxwell's findings and conclusions can be gleaned from paragraphs
    8, 9 and 10 of his decision which state:-

         "8.  The thrust of the cross examination of the appellant's sponsor
             related to the fact that he  was  paid  in  cash  rather  than
             directly into the bank and this seemed to be  the  sole  basis
             upon  which  his  employment  was  doubted.   I  was  somewhat
             surprised  by  this,  given  that  payment  in  cash   remains
             relatively common in the United Kingdom albeit it is no longer
             the  principal  means  of  paying  employees.   There  was  no
             evidence before me to suggest there was anything  out  of  the
             ordinary about this method of payment and I give little weight
             to this fact in the light of other  more  compelling  evidence
             that was presented.

           9.   The  appellant  and  the  respondent  had   both   submitted
             documentary evidence from HMRC which proved,  conclusively  in
             my view, the appellant is employed as claimed and has been  so
             employed for some significant time.  It is apparent, from  the
             earlier determination that he claimed employed by this company
             as long ago as 2011.  I find no  reasonable  basis  whatsoever
             for this Refusal which has been maintained on the basis of the
             false premise drawn by the Entry Clearance Manager.

           10.  I  find  the  appellant  has  proved,  on  the  balance   of
             probabilities, that her sponsor is employed  as  claimed,  his
             income exceeds the  minimum  required  under  the  Immigration
             rules and that in all respects she does meet the  requirements
             of the Immigration Rules for entry clearance as a partner."

 7. The respondent sought permission to appeal  and  this  was  granted  by
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal P J G White on 16 February 2015.   His
    reasons for so granting were:-

         "1.  The Respondent seeks permission to appeal against  a  decision
             of First-tier Tribunal Judge Maxwell who, in  a  Decision  and
             Reasons promulgated on 3 December 2014 allowed the Appellant's
             appeal against the Respondent's decision to  refuse  to  grant
             entry clearance as a spouse.

          2.  If necessary, I extend time for permission to appeal as  I  am
             satisfied that it is in the interests of justice to do so.

          3.  Having had regard to the grounds for permission to appeal  and
             the Decision and Reasons, I am satisfied that in reaching  his
             decision the judge arguably made  an  error  of  law  for  the
             following reasons:-

             (a)  The judge allowed  the  appeal  on  the  basis  that  the
                  Appellant met the financial requirements of Appendix FM.

             (b)  It is arguable, however, that in making his decision  the
                  judge has  failed  to  engage  with  the  issue  that  the
                  specified documentary evidence regarding finances must  be
                  provided at the time of the application.

          4.  Accordingly I am satisfied that the grounds and  Decision  and
             Reasons disclose an arguable error of law."

 8. Thus the appeal came before me today.

 9. Mr Tufan argued that the judge in the First-tier materially misdirected
    himself in law on the basis that  the  Immigration  Rules  relating  to
    specified evidence are comprehensively  set  out  in  Appendix  FM  and
    Appendix FM-SE to the Immigration Rules and argued that the  judge  had
    no regard to these Rules relating to specified evidence when making his
    findings and conclusions  thereby  rendering  them  unsustainable.   He
    argued that it is clear that the appellant cannot meet the requirements
    of Appendix FM-SE for the  six  month  period  prior  to  the  date  of
    application and that these are mandatory requirements  thereby  causing
    the appellant to be unable to meet the requirements of the  Immigration
    Rules.  Beyond that he argued that where a sponsor is paid in cash, for
    the gross income to be taken into account, all of the  monies  received
    from employment must be  paid  directly  into  the  bank.   This  is  a
    mandatory requirement and where only part of the money is so  deposited
    then only the net amount deposited can be counted when calculating  the
    income for the purposes of meeting the financial  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

10. Mr Ell argued that the respondent's position before me was misconceived
    in that the starting point for any current  consideration  is  why  the
    original application was refused by the Entry Clearance Officer.   That
    was not by reason of the absence of specified evidence but  because  of
    the Entry Clearance Officer's assertion that  the  appellant,  via  her
    sponsor's income, could not meet the �18,600 requirement.  The payslips
    had been provided in support of the application and it was  these  that
    the judge took into account when concluding that the appellant met  the
    financial requirement.  Therefore there was no material error of law as
    asserted by the respondent.

11. I have considered the totality of the  evidence  that  was  put  before
    Judge Maxwell.  Contrary to the grounds seeking  permission  to  appeal
    the relevant payslips were provided to the Entry Clearance  Officer  at
    the point of making the application and  were  before  the  judge  when
    considering the appeal.

12. The requirements of paragraph 2 of Appendix FM-SE  applicable  to  this
    appeal states that in  terms  of  salaried  employment  in  the  United
    Kingdom wage slips must be provided for a period of six months prior to
    the date of application and that personal bank statements corresponding
    to the same period as the wage slips at paragraph 2A showing  that  the
    salary has been paid into an account in the name of a person  or  their
    partner jointly.

13. Here the judge had come to conclusions that were open to be made on the
    evidence that was  before  him.   In  short  the  required  documentary
    evidence was provided at the time of application and considered in  the
    course of the appeal.  It is disconcerting  that  the  grounds  seeking
    permission to appeal appear to be misconceived.

Conclusions

14. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law.

15. I do not set aside the decision.
