                            DECISION AND REASONS




Previous Hearings

1.    In this matter the Appellants had been granted  permission  to  appeal
    following a hearing on 16th October 2015 before Deputy  Upper  Tribunal
    Judge Davey.  The hearing before me was a resumed hearing.

2.    Judge Davey had set out in his decision that Mrs Zefack is a  national
    of France and Mr Voua a national  of  the  Ivory  Coast.  The  original
    appeal  was  against  the  Secretary  of  State's  decision  to  refuse
    permanent resident pursuant to the provisions of Regulation 15  of  the
    Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006. Namely that   in
    respect of Regulation 15(1)(a) the Respondent was  not  satisfied  that
    Mrs Zefack had resided in the United Kingdom  in  accordance  with  the
    Regulations for a continuous  period  of  5  years.  Thereby  Mr  Voua,
    himself not an EEA national, had thereby  not  resided  in  the  United
    Kingdom for a continuous period of  5  years  in  accordance  with  the
    Regulations either.

3.    Judge Davey also noted that the Mrs Zefack had contended that she  had
    been employed in the United  Kingdom  since  12  February  2006  to  15
    January 2012. She was a  student  thereafter  and  work  had  continued
    through to the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal Judge in December
    2014.

4.    Judge Davey found that there was a material error of law and that  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge's decision could not stand because there  had
    been an error in respect of when the period  of  continuous  employment
    needed to be commenced from. There was therefore to be a re-hearing  in
    respect of the EEA Regulations. Finally Judge Davey noted that  Article
    8 had not been pursued. Indeed Article 8  was  not  pursued  before  me
    either.

The Hearing

5.    At the hearing before me that the Appellants' bundle for  the  hearing
    had not been sent to  the  Home  Office  as  ordered  by  Judge  Davey.
    Therefore he had not had a chance to read the bundle and to take a view
    about the case. He said that he  had  discussed  the  matter  with  Mrs
    Imamovic and that the plan was for Mrs Zefack to give  evidence  so  he
    could follow what was being contended in the evidence and in the  large
    bundle of documents from the  Appellants  (comprising  167  pages  with
    numerous documents). He would take a view after hearing  the  evidence.
    There was also a skeleton argument on behalf of  the  Appellants  dated
    2nd June 2016 from Mrs Imamovic, along with previous skeleton arguments
    in the bundle.

6.    Mrs Imamovic agreed this would be a good way of dealing  with  matters
    and proceeded to call Mrs Zefack to give evidence.

7.    Mrs Zefack adopted her witness statement at pages 17 to 18.  She  then
    gave evidence and was  cross  referred  to  various  documents  in  the
    bundle. I shall refer to her evidence as appears most  relevant  during
    the findings I have made in this case. Of note though after having  the
    heard the evidence, Mr Mills was of the view that he was unable to make
    any concessions about the evidence.

8.    Thereafter, Mr Voua gave evidence. He adopted his  witness  statement.
    There were no further questions put to him.

The EEA Regulations

9.    Regulation 15 of the Immigration (European Economic Area)  Regulations
    2006 provides as follows,

         This section has no associated Explanatory Memorandum

         15.-(1) The following persons shall acquire the right to reside in
         the United Kingdom permanently-

             (a) an EEA national who has resided in the United Kingdom in
             accordance with these Regulations for a continuous period of
             five years;

             (b) a family member of an EEA national who is not himself an
             EEA national but who has resided in the United Kingdom with
             the EEA national in accordance with these Regulations for a
             continuous period of five years;

             (c) a worker or self-employed person who has ceased activity;

             (d) the family member of a worker or self-employed person who
             has ceased activity;

             (e) a person who was the family member of a worker or self-
             employed person where-

                  (i) the worker or self-employed person has died;

                  (ii) the family member resided with him immediately before
                  his death; and

                  (iii) the worker or self-employed person had resided
                  continuously in the United Kingdom for at least the two
                  years immediately before his death or the death was the
                  result of an accident at work or an occupational disease;

             (f) a person who-

                  (i) has resided in the United Kingdom in accordance with
                  these Regulations for a continuous period of five years;
                  and

                  (ii) was, at the end of that period, a family member who
                  has retained the right of residence.

             (2) Once acquired, the right of permanent residence under this
             regulation shall be lost only through absence from the  United
             Kingdom for a period exceeding two consecutive years.

             (3) But this regulation is subject to regulation 19(3)(b)."


Submissions Summarised

10.     I heard submissions from both parties, it having  been  agreed  that
    Mrs Imamovic would go first with her  submissions.  It  was  said  that
    there was a right of residence from 2005 to 2010.  In  2008/2009  there
    was intermittent working. Therefore Mrs Zefack had already  obtained  a
    right to residence. From 2006 to she had  continued  to  study  and  to
    work. The gaps, i.e. the Jobseekers Allowance, was for a  short  period
    of time. Mrs Imamovic said that if I was  against  her  in  respect  of
    those matters, then as set  out  in  her  skeleton  argument,  Extended
    Rights of Residence becomes appropriate. There it could  be  seen  that
    there is reliance on the case of Samsam (EEA: revocation  and  retained
    rights) [2011] UKUT 165 and MDB and others (Article 12, 1612/68)  Italy
    [2010] UKUT 161 (IAC).

11.   Mr Mills in his  submissions  said  that  it  was  clear  NHS  medical
    treatment  was  not  comprehensive  medical  insurance.  The   document
    provided to me today shows that there was no such insurance obtained by
    the Appellants until  March  2016.  Therefore  it  was  submitted  that
    studying until recently was irrelevant.  Mr Mills said  that  the  real
    question was whether Mrs Zefack was a worker. The  Regulations  do  not
    require permanent working.  For example Regulation 5 says they  do  not
    cease to be a worker if they are temporarily unemployed.  It  was  said
    that paragraph  8  of  the  Appellant's  skeleton  argument  which  had
    contended that a woman does not lose her status as a  worker/exercising
    treaty rights by being on maternity leave was indeed correct.

12.   Mr Mills said that the issue in the case though was the  gaps  in  the
    documents and therefore the dates. The  burden  of  proof  was  on  the
    Appellants. The oral evidence was vague. It was not a criticism but  it
    was vague. Perhaps most people would be. The  problem  was  that  there
    were just not the sufficient documents to show the required proof.  For
    example there was a gap well in excess of 6 months after  the  work  at
    Good  Hope  in  September  2009.  That  very  clearly  interrupted  the
    exercising of treaty rights. When a student,  she  was  not  exercising
    treaty rights. There was no documentary evidence to say otherwise.  The
    letter from Best Connection at page 29 is remarkably vague and  was  of
    poor quality.  The gap prior to 2009 remains  even  with  the  payslips
    from  September  2009  to  2012.  There  are  then   missing   payslips
    thereafter.  There is no evidence of work in the second half  of  2012.
    As for the National Insurance payments, that is a schedule. It  is  not
    what  was  paid  at  page  67.  Therefore  it  must  have  been  sparse
    employment. Page 27 appeared to be part of the same letter. Marginal or
    ancillary economic activity does not qualify her as a worker. There was
    just a ï¿½24 National Insurance payment in 2005/2006. It needs to be more
    than that. There are also the  gaps  in  2008/2009  and  in  2012/2013.
    There is no 5 year period.

13.   Mr  Mills  said  that  the  alternative  argument  on  behalf  of  the
    Appellants does not relate to  Permanent  Residence.  The  Respondent's
    decision only  relates  to  Permanent  Residence.  If  they  sought  an
    Extended Right of Residence then the application ought to be made.

14.   I gave Mrs Imamovic the last word and she  responded  to  some  of  Mr
    Mills' submissions. There had been a clear explanation as to  why  some
    of the documents could not be provided by the Appellants.  In  relation
    to the Extended Rights of Residence, there was reference to the case of
    MDB.

15.   Mr Mills said that having seen the case of MBD it  was  conceded  that
    Mrs Zafeck was therefore now a qualified person  for  the  purposes  of
    Regulation 6 today. It was a case in which it was being conceded that I
    could allow outright that Mrs Zafeck  as  a  French  national  wife  is
    qualified under Regulation 6 of the 2006 Regulations and therefore  her
    husband Mr Voua is entitled to an Extended  Right  of  Residence  under
    Regulation 14(2) and therefore he is entitled to a Residence Card under
    Regulation 17(2).

Findings

16.         In so far as the oral evidence is concerned, I accept  that  Mrs
    Zafeck was not attempting to lie or  to  deceive  me  during  her  oral
    evidence, but it was indeed an obvious feature of  the  case  that  she
    struggled significantly to deal with dates and questions about when and
    where she was working at any particular time. I accept that her  former
    employers and others have not been  the  most  helpful  in  wishing  to
    provide her with accurate documents of what happened, but Mr  Mills  is
    entirely right that ultimately the  burden  of  proof  remains  on  the
    Appellants. I cannot ignore the gaps in the  evidence  just  because  I
    might  be  sympathetic  to  the  situation  that  the  Appellants  find
    themselves in. I have taken into account the short witness statement by
    Mr Voua at pages 19 to 20 but  that  was  the  same  witness  statement
    before the First-tier Tribunal and does  not  really  engage  with  the
    issues before me. Nor had Mr Voua said any more in  his  oral  evidence
    other than to adopt that witness statement.

17.    Therefore  although  I  do  not  find  that  Mrs  Zafeck   has   been
    deliberately obstructive or the like in her evidence, I  do  find  that
    she has unable to satisfy me to the required balance  of  probabilities
    standard that she is entitled to a Permanent Right of Residence.

18.   The reasons that I come to this view are because of  the  difficulties
    she experienced in seeking to fill in the  gaps  in  her  evidence  and
    indeed in respect of her "CV" that she had provided. It is  regrettable
    that the very short written statement that her solicitors had  provided
    in the bundle did not deal with the obvious requirements. Mrs  Imamovic
    sought to assist as best she could during the hearing  and  during  the
    oral evidence but regrettably the gaps remained.

19.   There is no continuity in respect of any period of 5  years  when  one
    looks to the actual detail of the documents provided.

20.   First, there is the deficiency in the evidence in respect of  the  two
    claimed agencies that Mrs Zafeck claimed to work for. Mrs  Zafeck  told
    me she was unable to get  confirmation  from  the  agency  because  the
    records were discarded. Because she was not able to  give  me  accurate
    and detailed information I am not satisfied that she is correct in  her
    memory. The payslips and other documents  are  not  sufficient  because
    they do not fill in the gaps for the many months and  years  for  which
    there remain uncertainties.

21.   Second, there is then the document at  page  123  of  the  Appellant's
    bundle. Mrs Zefack said in her evidence that "this document  is  a  bit
    wrong". That was because she had claimed Jobseekers Allowance for  just
    two months. This seems to conflict with the document at page 130 of the
    bundle which a letter  from  the  Jobseekers  Allowance  is  showing  a
    payment of ï¿½64.90. It is not easy to reconcile the two documents and  I
    have not been able to resolve which is correct. It leaves  the  matter,
    at best, uncertain.

22.   Third, it was accepted by Mrs Zafeck that she  did  not  have  private
    health insurance until earlier this year.  She accepted that during her
    periods of studying she had relied on the NHS.  She  now  (since  March
    2016) has private health insurance but did not previously.

23.   Fourth, I regret to say that there  was  utter  confusion  during  Mrs
    Zafeck's oral evidence during cross examination. I make every allowance
    for how difficult witnesses find giving evidence and how in  this  case
    there is much reliance on memory, but I have not been able to reconcile
    the evidence in Mrs Zafeck's favour. By  way  of  example,  during  the
    start of cross examination Mrs Zafeck said she  had  commenced  working
    for Good Hope Hospital via the Best  Connection  agency  from  2009  to
    2012. She was asked to look at page 27 of the Respondent's bundle where
    she had previously said she had worked at Good Hope  Hospital  in  2010
    and not 2009.

24.   Mrs Zafeck said she made a mistake and that it was from 2010 that  she
    had started working at Good Hope hospital. The  problem  remained  that
    there was the gap for 2009. She said if she was at university then  she
    must have worked for just one year and not two.

25    Fifthly, as for the time  period  January  2012  to  August  2013  Mrs
    Zafeck said she could not really remember where  she  had  worked.  She
    said the payslips may deal with this, but she agreed that there were no
    or no sufficient payslips for 2014.  She said that the Judge had  asked
    her to get payslips but she could not get them. That  was  because  her
    agency/employers could not provide them. She said it was not clear  why
    the employer had said what was said  at  page  29  of  the  Appellant's
    bundle, namely that she had worked from May 2012 to June 2012 and  then
    in 2014 for 7 weeks and during intervals in 2010. She accepted this was
    inconsistent with her own evidence. She insisted  she  had  worked  for
    Best Connection in 2013 too. She said even though she  was  relying  on
    her employer's letter at page 29 it did not give the true facts.

26    Sixthly, she accepted that although she had  been  referring  to  bank
    statements, in fact the letters were in respect of overdraft  fees  and
    not bank statements which, for example, showed  her  earnings  for  the
    most part. There were many missing in any event.

27.   Finally, the National Insurance contributions noted at page 64 of  the
    Appellant's bundle merely shows what was needed to be paid and  in  any
    event for 2012-2013 there was just ï¿½26.50 apparently  to  be  paid.  If
    that is to mean that the National Insurance contributions for that year
    from employment was just ï¿½26.50 (I did not  get  a  proper  explanation
    from the Appellant what the document actually  meant)  then  it  hardly
    shows much in the way of employment.

28.   It is quite clear to me that  Mrs  Zafeck  has  worked,  studied,  has
    sought Jobseeker's Allowance and has been on maternity time, but in the
    end there are significant gaps in any period of time that I have sought
    to use and which was relied upon. My task was  not  made  easy  by  the
    failure of there being a proper witness statement.   Ms  Imamovic  said
    and did all she could, but regrettably the evidence is  simply  lacking
    and vague. There are obvious breaks in the continuity and there is no 5
    year period which can be shown for the purposes of the  claim  relating
    to Permanent Rights of Residence.

29.   I therefore conclude that the Appellant's appeal  in  respect  of  the
    claim to a Permanent Right of Residence has to fail.

30.   In view of Mr Mills' concession though  in  respect  of  the  Extended
    Right of Residence pursuant to Regulation 14 of  the  EEA  Regulations,
    and because Mr Mills said that the matter would not need to  return  to
    the Secretary of State to decide that issue, I allow the appeal on that
    basis.


Notice of Decision

The First-tier Tribunal's decision contained a material error of law and  is
set aside.
I remake the decision.
The appeal in respect of Permanent Rights of Residence is dismissed.
The appeal is allowed in respect of Regulation 14 of the  Immigration  (EEA)
Regulations 2006 relating to Extended Rights  of  Residence  in  respect  of
both Appellants. Mr Zafeck with reference to Regulation 14(1)  and  Mr  Voua
in respect of Regulation 17.


No anonymity order is made.

I make no order  for  costs  in  the  Appellants'  favour.  The  Appellants'
documents in this case remain inconsistent and  difficult  to  follow  which
has caused a disproportionate amount of time to be spent by the Tribunal  on
the case.
