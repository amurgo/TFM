Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr. S. Kandola, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr. T. Ogunnubi, TM Legal Services


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. By way of a decision promulgated on 18 March 2016, the decision of  the
    First-tier Tribunal promulgated on 28 August 2015 was set aside  to  be
    remade.


 2. For the purposes of this decision I refer to the Secretary of State  as
    the Respondent and to Mrs. Raimi as  the  Appellant,  reflecting  their
    positions as they were before the First-tier Tribunal.

 3. The Appellant and  Sponsor  attended  the  hearing  but  did  not  give
    evidence.  The Appellant provided a bundle of evidence consisting of 28
    pages.  I heard submissions from both representatives, following  which
    I reserved my decision, which I set out below with reasons.


Submissions

 4. Mr. Kandola relied on the grounds of  appeal.   At  the  error  of  law
    hearing it had been  found  that  the  Appellant  could  not  meet  the
    requirements of the immigration rules.  In relation to the appeal under
    Article 8, the Appellant had entered the United Kingdom on 20 May  2013
    as a Tier 4 student.  He submitted that  the  remedy  was  for  her  to
    return to Nigeria in order to apply for entry clearance  with  a  fresh
    application.


 5. The public interest in maintaining effective  immigration  control  was
    not diminished by the failure to meet the  technicalities  of  Appendix
    FM.  I was referred to the case of SS Congo [2015] EWCA  Civ  387.   He
    submitted that the time away from  the  United  Kingdom  making  a  new
    application would have to be very protracted in order for the  decision
    to breach Article 8.  Given  the  Appellant's  recent  entry  into  the
    United Kingdom, the public interest required her to seek the  requisite
    entry clearance.  It was a matter of choice if she wished to  take  her
    child with her to Nigeria while seeking  entry  clearance.   The  short
    duration of the period which she would be waiting was not  against  the
    best interests of the child given her very young age.


 6. Mr. Ogunnubi submitted that the reason why the judge in the  First-tier
    Tribunal had allowed the appeal  was  because  there  was  evidence  of
    earnings for 12 months.  Some bank  statements  were  missing  but  the
    judge accepted that the requirement was met.  The Sponsor had explained
    why he could not provide the statements.  The Sponsor's  oral  evidence
    had been  accepted.   The  Appellant  had  provided  a  great  deal  of
    information.  The Appellant's application should not be refused because
    a few bank statements were missing which was not her fault.


 7. The Appellant and Sponsor had a child born in April who was  a  British
    citizen.  It was submitted that the Appellant met the  requirements  of
    Appendix FM in relation to family life as she  had  a  British  citizen
    child. Paragraph EX.1(a) applied.  The Appellant was the primary  carer
    of a British citizen child.


 8. In relation to Article 8, the Appellant had been in the United  Kingdom
    for over three years living with the Sponsor.   The  Sponsor  had  been
    settled in the United Kingdom for over two years and  their  child  was
    British.  The Sponsor was working.  The burden would be  too  great  on
    the Appellant to go back to Nigeria to seek entry clearance, and  would
    place a strain on marital life.  There was  no  evidence  that  a  visa
    application from Nigeria would be forthcoming.  The  Appellant's  child
    would be separated from the Sponsor.  It was not proportionate to  make
    her return to Nigeria.


Remaking

Immigration rules


 9. I found in the error  of  law  decision  that  the  Appellant  had  not
    provided evidence to show that she met the requirements of Appendix FM-
    SE, and therefore the appeal could not succeed on this basis.   It  was
    acknowledged that she had not provided bank statements  covering  a  12
    month period.  I did not consider whether or not  the  Appellant  could
    meet the requirements of the immigration rules by another route.


10. I have considered the reasons for refusal letter.  The Respondent first
    considered whether the Appellant met  the  requirements  as  a  partner
    under the five year  route,  but  found  that  she  did  not  meet  the
    financial requirements by reference to Appendix FM-SE.  On  page  3  of
    the  reasons  for  refusal  letter  the   Respondent   considered   the
    Appellant's application as a partner under  the  ten-year  route.   The
    Respondent was not satisfied that the Appellant met the requirements of
    R-LRTP1.1(d)(iii) as she considered that paragraph EX.1 did  not  apply
    to the Appellant.  The Respondent did not refuse the  application  with
    reference to the  suitability  or  eligibility  requirements  (bar  the
    financial requirement which forms part of the eligibility requirements)
    in her consideration of the five year or the ten year route.


11. The only reason that the Respondent refused the Appellant's application
    under the ten year route was  because  she  considered  that  paragraph
    EX.1(b) did not apply.  The Respondent's decision was made  in  January
    2015.   The Appellant  gave  birth  to  her  daughter  in  April  2016.
    Therefore the Respondent did not  consider  whether  paragraph  EX.1(a)
    applied as the Appellant did not have a child at the time.


12. Paragraph EX.1(a) paragraph applies if:
       "(i)  the  applicant  has  a   genuine   and   subsisting   parental
       relationship with a child who-
                 (aa) is under the age of 18 years, or was under the age of
                 18 years when the applicant was first granted leave on the
                 basis that this paragraph applied;
                 (bb) is in the UK;
                 (cc) is a British Citizen or has lived in the UK
                 continuously for at least the 7 years immediately preceding
                 the date of application
         (ii) it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave the
    UK."
13. The Appellant's child is under 18, is in the United Kingdom  and  is  a
    British citizen.  I therefore need to consider whether or not it  would
    be reasonable to expect the child to leave the United Kingdom.


14.  In  considering  whether  or  not  it  is  reasonable  to  expect  the
    Appellant's child to leave  the  United  Kingdom,  I  have  taken  into
    account her best interests in accordance with section 55  of  the  2009
    Act.  Her best interests must be a primary concern.  I  find  that  she
    was born in the United Kingdom and is a British citizen.   Her  father,
    the Sponsor, has indefinite leave to remain and is settled and  working
    in the United Kingdom.  I find  that  the  Appellant's  child  is  very
    young, only two months old.  I find that it is in her best interests to
    remain with both of her parents, and  I  find  that  she  is  currently
    living with both of her parents in the United Kingdom.


15. I find that at this young age it would  not  be  in  the  child's  best
    interests to be separated from her mother, and I find therefore that if
    the Appellant were to leave the United Kingdom, her daughter would have
    to accompany her given her age and dependence on the Appellant.  I find
    that this would involve separation from her father.   If  she  were  to
    stay with the Sponsor, which would not be in her best interests as  she
    would be separated from her mother, I find that the Sponsor  would  not
    be able to continue to  work  as  he  would  have  to  look  after  his
    daughter, thereby making it impossible for the  Appellant  to  make  an
    application for entry clearance as she would not be able  to  meet  the
    financial requirements.


16. I have carefully considered the Respondent's own guidance contained  in
    Immigration Directorate  Instruction  Family  Migration:  Appendix  FM,
    August 2015.  At paragraph 11.2.3.  under  the  heading  "Would  it  be
    unreasonable to expect a British Citizen child to  leave  the  UK?"  it
    states:


    "Save in cases involving criminality, the decision maker must not  take
    a decision in relation to the parent or  primary  carer  of  a  British
    Citizen child where the effect of that decision would be to force  that
    British child to leave the EU, regardless of the  age  of  that  child.
    This reflects the European Court of Justice judgment in Zambrano."


17. Later in the same section it states:


    "Where a decision to refuse the application would require a  parent  or
    primary carer to return to a country outside  the  EU,  the  case  must
    always be assessed on the basis that it would be unreasonable to expect
    a British Citizen child to leave the EU with  that  parent  or  primary
    carer.


    In such cases it will usually be appropriate  to  grant  leave  to  the
    parent or primary carer, to enable them to remain in the  UK  with  the
    child, provided that there is satisfactory evidence of  a  genuine  and
    subsisting parental relationship.


    It may, however, be appropriate to refuse  to  grant  leave  where  the
    conduct of the parent or primary carer gives rise to considerations  of
    such weight as to justify separation, if the child could otherwise stay
    with another parent or alternative primary carer in the UK  or  in  the
    EU.


    The circumstances envisaged could cover amongst others:
    ( criminality falling below the thresholds set out in paragraph 398  of
    the Immigration Rules;
    ( a very poor  immigration  history,  such  as  where  the  person  has
    repeatedly and deliberately breached the Immigration Rules."


18. I find that there is no evidence of any criminality, and none has  been
    alleged by  the  Respondent.   The  Appellant  does  not  have  a  poor
    immigration history.  She has had leave to remain at all times.   Given
    the very young age of the Appellant's child, a decision to refuse leave
    to the Appellant would require a British citizen child to leave the  EU
    as she would have to return to Nigeria with  the  Appellant.   This  is
    contrary to the Respondent's own guidance to decision makers.


19. I find, on the balance of probabilities, at the date  of  the  hearing,
    given  the  circumstances  of  the  recent  birth  of  the  Appellant's
    daughter, and taking into account the Respondent's own IDI, that it  is
    not reasonable to expect the Appellant's  child  to  leave  the  United
    Kingdom, and therefore paragraph EX.1(a)  applies.   I  therefore  find
    that the Appellant has shown, on the balance of probabilities, that she
    meets the requirements of the immigration rules, D-LTRP.1.2.


Article 8


20. In case I am wrong in this, I have considered  the  Appellant's  appeal
    under Article 8 outside the immigration rules in  accordance  with  the
    steps set out in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27.  I find that the Appellant  has
    a family life with the Sponsor and their child and that the decision to
    remove her would interfere with this family life.


21. Continuing the steps set out  in  Razgar,  I  find  that  the  proposed
    interference would be in accordance with the law, as  being  a  regular
    immigration decision taken by UKBA in accordance with  the  immigration
    rules.  In terms of proportionality, the Tribunal has to strike a  fair
    balance between the rights of the individual and the interests  of  the
    community.  The public interest in this case  is  the  preservation  of
    orderly and fair immigration control in the interests of all  citizens.
    Maintaining the integrity of the immigration rules is self-evidently  a
    very important public interest.  In practice, this will  usually  trump
    the  qualified  rights  of  the  individual,  unless   the   level   of
    interference is very significant.  I find that in this case, the  level
    of  interference  would  be  significant  and  that  it  would  not  be
    proportionate.


22. In carrying out the proportionality exercise, I have taken into account
    the factors set out in section 117B of the 2002 Act,  insofar  as  they
    are  relevant.   Section  117B(1)  provides  that  the  maintenance  of
    effective  immigration  controls  is  in  the  public  interest.    The
    Appellant came to the United Kingdom as a student and so would have  to
    have demonstrated a certain level of  English  language  ability.   Her
    application was not refused  because  she  did  not  meet  the  English
    language requirements, and I therefore find that she can speak  English
    (117B(2)).


23. In relation to her financial situation, (117B(3)),  the  Appellant  did
    not provide the specified evidence required to show that the  Sponsor's
    income was in excess of �18,600.  This  was  because  the  Sponsor  was
    unable to obtain bank statements covering the period from June 2014  to
    October 2014 owing to a closure of an online bank account.  He provided
    the payslips for this period showing that he was paid during this time.
     It was submitted at the hearing that the Sponsor is working to provide
    financially for the family.  I find on  the  balance  of  probabilities
    that the Appellant and Sponsor are financially independent.


24. Sections 117B(4) and (5) are not relevant to any family life.   I  find
    that the Appellant has had leave to remain in the United Kingdom at all
    times.  She came with leave as a student, and made her application  for
    leave to remain as a spouse before her leave expired.


25. Section 117B(6) provides that, in the case of someone who is not liable
    to deportation, the public  interest  does  not  require  the  person's
    removal where they have a genuine and subsisting parental  relationship
    with a qualifying child, and it would not be reasonable to  expect  the
    child to leave the United  Kingdom.   The  Appellant's  daughter  is  a
    British citizen, and is therefore a qualifying child for  the  purposes
    of section 117B(6).  I find  that  the  Appellant  has  a  genuine  and
    subsisting parental relationship with her child.


26. I have found above in relation to paragraph EX.1 that it would  not  be
    reasonable to expect the  Appellant's  daughter  to  leave  the  United
    Kingdom, with specific reference to the Respondent's IDI.  The  wording
    is the same under section 117B(6) as in paragraph EX.1(a).  Taking into
    account all of my  findings  as  set  out  above  in  relation  to  the
    Appellant and her family, in particular the young age of her  daughter,
    and taking into account the factors set out in  section  117B,  I  find
    that the balance comes down in favour of the Appellant.   I  find  that
    the Appellant has shown on the balance of probabilities, at the date of
    the hearing, that the decision is a breach of her rights, and those  of
    the Sponsor and their daughter, to a family life under Article 8 ECHR.


Decision

27. The appeal under the immigration rules is allowed.


28. The appeal is allowed on human rights grounds.
