                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction and Background

 1. The Appellant appeals against a decision of Judge Graham (the judge) of
    the First-tier Tribunal (the FtT) promulgated on 8th January 2019.

 2. The Appellant is a male Ghanaian citizen  born  12th  March  1978.   He
    applied for entry clearance to the UK to enable him to settle with  his
    spouse [ID], a British citizen, to whom I shall refer as the Sponsor.

 3. The Sponsor has two daughters, born in the UK on 19th May 2001 and 24th
    December 2007.  The  Sponsor  is  not  their  biological  father.   The
    application was made on the  basis  that  the  Appellant  had  met  the
    Sponsor in the UK in February 2013.  They subsequently entered  into  a
    relationship and it was contended that the Appellant had established  a
    parental relationship with the children.  In October 2016 the Appellant
    and Sponsor travelled to Ghana where they married on 25th October 2016.



 4. The Sponsor then returned to the UK and the Appellant applied for entry
    clearance which was refused on 10th November 2017.

 5. In summary the application was refused for the following reasons.

 6. It was not  accepted  that  the  Appellant  satisfied  the  suitability
    grounds under section S-EC of Appendix FM  because  he  had  failed  to
    provide a medical report, from an approved clinic  confirming  that  he
    had undergone screening for tuberculosis.

 7. It was not  accepted  that  the  Appellant  satisfied  the  eligibility
    requirements as the Respondent was not satisfied that his  relationship
    with the Sponsor is genuine and subsisting and was not  satisfied  that
    they intended to live together permanently in the UK.  In addition  the
    Appellant had failed to  provide  evidence  of  his  divorce  from  his
    previous spouse.

 8. The financial requirements were not satisfied  as  the  Sponsor  had  a
    gross income of less than �18,600 per year.   Evidence  indicated  that
    her gross  income  was  �12,180  per  year  and  specified  documentary
    evidence to prove the Sponsor's income had not been submitted.

 9. It was accepted that the  Appellant  satisfied  that  English  language
    requirement.

10. It was not accepted that  the  application  disclosed  any  exceptional
    circumstances which would result in justifiably harsh  consequences  if
    entry clearance was refused.

11. The appeal was heard by the judge on  6th  December  2018.   The  judge
    found in favour of the Appellant in  that  it  was  accepted  that  the
    required medical report had been submitted  with  the  application  for
    entry clearance.

12. The judge found that the Appellant  and  Sponsor  have  a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship and they intend to live permanently together in
    the UK as husband and wife.  The judge  therefore  must  have  accepted
    that the Appellant had been divorced  from  his  previous  spouse,  and
    entered into a valid marriage with the Sponsor.

13. The judge found that the Sponsor's income was  less  than  �18,600  per
    annum.  The judge considered paragraph  21A  of  Appendix  FM-SE  which
    permits consideration as to whether there would be a credible guarantee
    of sustainable financial support from a third party.  In this case  the
    judge noted that there was said to  be  third  party  support  from  Mr
    Yussef Ali.  However the judge noted that Mr Ali had not  attended  the
    hearing and not provided a witness statement, and therefore found  that
    there was no credible guarantee of financial support from him.

14. The judge did not consider that the application  disclosed  exceptional
    circumstances.  The judge considered whether the Appellant has "a quasi-
    parental relationship with the Sponsor's children" taking into  account
    the guidance in R on the application of RK v  SSHD,  IJR  [2016].   The
    judge found that the Appellant did not have a  genuine  and  subsisting
    parental relationship with the Sponsor's children.

15. The judge considered that refusal of entry clearance was  proportionate
    and in the public interest, taking  into  account  that  the  financial
    requirements of the Immigration Rules  could  not  be  satisfied.   The
    appeal was therefore dismissed.

The Application for Permission to Appeal

16. The Appellant applied for permission to appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal.
    The grounds were prepared by his solicitors and are  summarised  below.
    It was submitted that the judge  erred  in  law  in  finding  that  the
    Appellant did not have  a  parental  relationship  with  the  Sponsor's
    children.  It was contended that the judge had been informed  that  the
    children's biological father was deceased and therefore  the  Appellant
    is the de facto father of the children.  During his presence in the  UK
    the Appellant played  an  essential  role  in  the  upbringing  of  the
    children.  The death certificate of the biological father was submitted
    with the application for permission to appeal which indicates  that  he
    died on 23rd November 2010.

17. It was submitted that although the judge had  cited  RK,  she  had  not
    applied the principles contained therein.

18. It was contended that the judge had erred by failing to  attach  weight
    to the evidence of  the  third  party  supporter  Mr  Ali.   A  witness
    statement from Mr Ali was submitted with the application for permission
    to appeal.

19.  It  was  submitted  that  the  judge's   assessment   of   exceptional
    circumstances was flawed in  that  refusal  of  entry  clearance  would
    result in unjustifiably harsh consequences, for the Appellant,  Sponsor
    and the children.

Permission to Appeal

20. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge Neville of  the  FtT  in  the
    following terms;

         "2.  The judge held  that  the  Appellant  had  not  established  a
             genuine  and  subsisting  parental   relationship   with   the
             Sponsor's children.  The judge cites RK IJR  [2016]  UKUT  31,
             providing  that  it  would  be  unusual  for  more  than   two
             individuals to have a parental relationship with a child.  She
             then places weight on there being no evidence of the extent to
             which  the  children's  father  (as  named  on   their   birth
             certificates) plays a part in their lives.

         3.   The grounds  (despite  being  somewhat  difficult  to  follow)
             clearly argue that the judge  was  in  error,  the  children's
             birth father is dead.  A death certificate is attached to  the
             grounds.

         4.   Despite insufficient evidence being provided  to  substantiate
             the  grounds'  contention  that   the   father's   death   was
             communicated to the judge, applying principles  of  procedural
             fairness, including those discussed in MM (unfairness; E &  R)
             Sudan [2014]  UKUT  00105  (IAC),  the  grounds  are  arguably
             correct that the involvement of the birth father never  having
             been raised as an issue by anyone  (including  the  Presenting
             Officer) it was an error of law for the judge  to  place  then
             weight on the issue.

         5.   The other grounds are much weaker, but may be argued."

21. Directions were issued that there should be a hearing before the  Upper
    Tribunal to ascertain whether the FtT had erred in law  such  that  the
    decision should be set aside.

The Upper Tribunal Hearing

22. At the commencement of the hearing it was apparent that Mr Williams had
    not received a bundle of documents containing 38 pages submitted by the
    Appellant.  This bundle contained some  documents  that  had  not  been
    before the FtT, such as the death certificate of the biological father,
    statements made by both children, and a witness statement  made  by  Mr
    Ali.

23. I indicated to Mr Awal that while Mr Williams would need a copy of  the
    skeleton argument contained within this bundle, it would presumably not
    be necessary to supply him with witness statements that  had  not  been
    before  the  FtT  as  those  documents  would  not  be  relevant   when
    considering whether the judge had erred in law, which  was  a  decision
    that should normally be taken based upon the evidence that  was  before
    the judge.

24. Mr Awal agreed that such was the case, and the hearing  proceeded  when
    Mr Williams had been given an opportunity to consider  the  Appellant's
    skeleton argument.  Mr Awal then made  submissions  contending  that  I
    should take into account evidence that had not  been  before  the  FtT,
    such as the death certificate, the witness statement  from  Mr  Yussif,
    and statements made by the children which had been produced  after  the
    FtT hearing, as the judge  had  commented  upon  the  absence  of  such
    statements.

25. Mr Awal submitted that he had told the judge that the biological father
    was deceased which if correct,  would  seem  to  negate  the  grant  of
    permission which at paragraph 4, indicates that there  is  an  arguable
    error of law as the death of  the  biological  father  had  never  been
    raised as an issue by anyone at the FtT hearing.

26. It was submitted that the judge had erred by failing to find  that  the
    Appellant had a  parental  relationship  with  the  children.   It  was
    submitted that the judge had also erred in failing to find  exceptional
    circumstances as unjustifiably harsh consequences would follow if entry
    clearance was refused.

27. While it was accepted that Mr Ali had not provided a witness  statement
    before the FtT, I was asked to find that he had  now  provided  such  a
    statement, and that he could provide the  necessary  financial  support
    and therefore the judge had erred in finding otherwise.

28. Mr Awal submitted that MM Sudan was authority to  confirm  that  at  an
    error of law hearing I could take into account, when  deciding  whether
    an FtT Judge had erred in law, witness statements  that  had  not  been
    considered by the judge.

29. Mr Williams submitted that the judge had not erred in  law  and  relied
    upon a response submitted pursuant to rule 24 of the Tribunal Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal)  Rules  2008.   This  contended  that  the  judge  was
    entitled to find, due to an absence of evidence, that the Appellant did
    not have a parental relationship with the Sponsor's children,  and  the
    judge was entitled to  find  that  a  failure  to  meet  the  financial
    requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules  indicated  that  the  public
    interest lay in refusing entry clearance.

30. Mr Williams advised that there was no reference in the notes  taken  by
    his colleague who had appeared before the judge, to indicate  that  the
    judge had been informed that the biological father  was  deceased.   In
    any event Mr Williams submitted that the judge had not made a  positive
    finding that the biological father had played a part in the  children's
    lives.

31. It was submitted that the judge had made findings open to her  to  make
    on the evidence, and provided adequate reasons, and had  not  erred  in
    law.

32. At the conclusion of oral submissions I reserved my decision.

My Conclusions and Reasons

33. I do not consider that MM Sudan is authority to  indicate  that  at  an
    error of law hearing, I should take into account witness statements and
    evidence that had not been before the judge in the FtT.  In this case I
    find it appropriate to consider whether or not the judge erred in  law,
    by taking into account the evidence that was before the judge.

34. I deal firstly with the financial requirements and the finding  by  the
    judge that these could not be satisfied.  It is not in dispute that  Mr
    Ali did  not  attend  the  hearing  and  had  not  provided  a  witness
    statement.   The  judge  considered  the  financial   requirements   at
    paragraphs 20-27.

35. The judge found, and it is not disputed, that the Sponsor had an annual
    income less than �18,600.  The judge considered Mr Ali at paragraphs 22-
    25 noting that he had submitted an identity card, a residence card, and
    an employment letter, together with wage  slips  and  bank  statements.
    The judge noted that Mr Ali had not attended the hearing  and  had  not
    provided a witness statement and concluded that there was  insufficient
    evidence to show that Mr Ali supported the appeal or that he had agreed
    to provide third party support.  The judge recorded  that  the  Sponsor
    knew very little about Mr Ali other than to say that he was a  national
    of Belgium, and a friend of  the  Appellant.   She  did  not  know  his
    address and accepted she had not had any contact with him.

36. The judge was fully entitled in the  circumstances,  to  conclude  that
    there was no indication of the level of financial support that  Mr  Ali
    would offer or the period over which it would be provided.   The  judge
    was unable to assess whether the third party  financial  support  would
    make up the shortfall between the �18,600 required  and  the  Sponsor's
    income.

37. The judge also noted that there was  no  indication  of  the  financial
    circumstances  of  Mr  Ali,  and  no  details  of  his  dependents   or
    liabilities and outgoings.  I would  comment  that  the  statement  now
    provided does not address all of these issues.

38. The judge dealt with the  financial  requirements  comprehensively  and
    made findings that she was bound to make in the circumstances, and  has
    given perfectly adequate and sustainable reasons for the findings made.
     This Ground of Appeal does not disclose an error of law.

39.  Turning  to  the  contention  that  the  judge  erred  in  considering
    exceptional circumstances, the judge at  paragraph  29  considered  the
    best interests of the children as a primary consideration.   The  judge
    then considered  at  paragraphs  30-31  whether  the  Appellant  had  a
    parental relationship with the Sponsor's children.   I  do  not  accept
    that the judge was informed that the biological father of the  children
    was  deceased.   There  is  no  reference  in  the  judge's  Record  of
    Proceedings to her receiving this information.  There is no  record  in
    the Home Office note of proceedings to this information being provided.
     I find that if the judge had  been  told  at  the  hearing,  that  the
    biological father was deceased, she would have referred to this in  her
    decision.

40. The finding that the judge makes in relation to the  biological  father
    is that there is no evidence before her to show  the  extent  that  the
    children's biological father plays in their  lives.   That  is  not  an
    unfair finding and is not an error of law.

41. The judge is not stating that the biological father does play a role in
    their lives.  The judge notes the  lack  of  evidence  to  support  the
    Appellant's claim that he has a genuine parental relationship with  the
    children.  The evidence that is lacking is listed at paragraph  31  and
    includes a lack of any evidence from the schools  of  the  children  to
    confirm that the Appellant collects them, or attends parents'  evenings
    and school events.  The judge also records that there  is  no  evidence
    that the Appellant is on the school record as a  responsible  adult  in
    relation to the children.  The judge notes that the children  have  not
    submitted witness statements  detailing  their  relationship  with  the
    Appellant.  In my view the judge was  entitled  to  conclude  that  the
    Appellant had failed to show that  he  had  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    parental relationship with the children.

42. At paragraph  32  the  judge  considers  the  Sponsor's  mental  health
    condition and notes that appointment letters  have  been  provided  but
    records that the medical evidence does not provide any diagnosis.   The
    judge was entitled to find that the Sponsor's  medical  condition  does
    not constitute exceptional circumstances.

43. The judge then  considers  proportionality  and  section  117B  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  The judge finds that the
    public interest weighs in favour of refusal of entry clearance  to  the
    UK, and does not err in law in so doing.  The  judge  was  entitled  to
    note the relevance of the Appellant's failure to satisfy the  financial
    requirements of the Immigration Rules.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the FtT does not disclose an error of law.   I  do  not  set
aside the decision.  The appeal is dismissed.

There has been no request for anonymity  and  I  see  no  need  to  make  an
anonymity direction.
