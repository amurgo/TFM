For the Respondents:   Mr F Khaled, Legal Representative from Lords

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal brought by the Secretary of State with the  permission
    of the First-tier Tribunal against a  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Parkes  who  allowed  the  appeals  of  the  present  respondents,
    hereinafter "the claimants", against a  decision  of  the  Secretary  of
    State refusing applications from a man and his wife for leave to  remain
    as Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) Migrants  or  dependant.   The  applications
    were refused because the claimants did not produce a  required  document
    when applications were presented. The  required  document  was  produced
    later before the application was decided.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Parkes was persuaded that an application is an
    ongoing process and provided that the necessary documents were  produced
    before the decision was made then, for the purposes of the  rules,  they
    were produced "with the application". In making  this  decision  he  was
    anticipating an explanation of the law given by the President, Blake  J,
    and Upper Tribunal Judge Coker in the case of Khatel &  Others  (Section
    85A; effective continuing application) [2013] UKUT  00044,  (IAC)  which
    confirms authoritatively the precise principle  on  which  Judge  Parkes
    acted.

 3. Before me Mr Hussain asked for an adjournment. It is a matter of  record
    that the President has given permission to appeal the decision in Khatel
    to the Court of Appeal but I see no merit in adjourning cases to see  if
    the law changes. Rather I will apply the law as it is and  I  intend  to
    follow Khatel. Mr Hussain  then,  appropriately  from  his  perspective,
    submitted that Khatel was wrongly  decided.   He  did  not  develop  the
    argument and I am wholly unpersuaded that it is wrongly  decided  and  I
    have every intention of following it.

 4. It follows therefore that for the reasons given in Khatel  Judge  Parkes
    was right and I uphold his decision.

 5. I dismiss the appeal of the  Secretary  of  State.  The  decision  Judge
    Parkes shall stand.
