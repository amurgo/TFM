Representation:
For the appellants:    Mr Michael Biggs of Counsel, instructed by ITN
Solicitors
For the respondent:    Ms Alexandra Everett, a Senior Home Office
Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants appeal with permission from the decision of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal dismissing their appeal against the respondent's decision
    on 5 February 2018 to refuse them indefinite leave to remain  on  human
    rights grounds based on 10 years' continuous  residence  by  the  first
    appellant, and his private and family life with his  wife,  the  second
    appellant and their infant daughter born in the  United  Kingdom  on  6
    June 2016. Both appellants are Indian citizens.

 2. The appeal of the second appellant stands or falls  with  that  of  the
    principal appellant: her status was always  as  his  dependant.   Their
    daughter is not an appellant in this appeal but her  circumstances  are
    relevant, because of her citizenship.

 3.  'New  matter':  statelessness  of  the   appellants'   daughter.   The
    appellants' daughter, who is now 5 years old, was never  registered  as
    an Indian citizen and Ms Everett for the  respondent  did  not  dispute
    that as a matter of law, she is stateless: see  R on the application of
    MK (a child, by her litigation friend CAE) v Secretary of State for the
    Home Department  [2017]  EWHC  1365  (Admin).   On  8  June  2021,  the
    appellants' daughter  applied  for  British  citizen  status  and  that
    application is pending.

 4. On behalf of the Secretary  of  State,  Ms  Everett  indicated  at  the
    hearing that she did not  object  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  taking  the
    nationality of the appellants' daughter into account  as  an  issue  in
    these proceedings, and also as part of the human rights factual matrix.



 5. Mode of hearing.  The hearing today took place face to face, save  that
    the principal appellant's accountant, Mr Usman Butt, was  available  to
    give evidence by Microsoft Teams.  In the event,  Ms  Everett  did  not
    seek to cross-examine him and he appeared only briefly, so that I could
    explain to him that his evidence would not be called upon.

Background

 6. The principal appellant ('the appellant') has  a  physics  degree  from
    Pune University.  In September 2006, he came to the United  Kingdom  to
    study for an MSc in Management at Robert Gordon University, and  worked
    for Primark during his studies. He  set  up  a  self-employed  business
    consultancy,  trading  as  'Maxwell  Consultancy.    He   developed   a
    significant client base and his self-employment prospered, as  did  his
    work  for  Primark,  where  he  became  a  Manager  in  the  Operations
    department. The appellant remained in the United Kingdom as a  student,
    although he did return to India in 2009 when his  first  visa  expired,
    applying for a second visa and returning successfully after  two  weeks
    in India.

 7. In 2010/2011, the appellant filed the first ever tax return, completing
    it himself.  He took advice from friends who considered the process  to
    be fairly straightforward.  He constructed a spreadsheet  to  help  him
    work out his tax, but he made a  major  error  by  deducting  from  his
    turnover the significant outgoings on his business account: instead  of
    �28060 turnover, he inserted �8060 in the tax return as  his  turnover.
    He paid the tax and continued trading.   In 2012/2013, he made the same
    error in his tax return, again understating the figure significantly.

 8. On 4 April 2011, the appellant applied for leave to remain as a Tier  1
    (General) Migrant, which was granted on 22 June 2011, valid to 22  June
    2013.  The respondent's GCID notes confirm that his declared income was
    accepted to be genuine and that he was awarded 35 points  for  previous
    earnings.

 9. On 9 April 2013, the appellant applied for further leave to remain as a
    Tier 1 migrant, and again the GCID  notes  confirm  that  the  previous
    earnings were accepted to be  genuine  and  that  the  application  was
    allowed on that basis, with leave given from 26 June 2013  to  26  June
    2016.  The  second  appellant  now  works  as  a  Quality  Analyst  for
    Prudential through his company, Harsha Limited (named after his wife).

10. The appellant's maternal grandfather suffered a stroke towards the  end
    of 2011 but battled on until 20 February 2013.  At the same  time,  the
    appellant was organising his wedding to the second appellant, which was
    to take place in India.  He says that he lost focus and was careless in
    his tax returns during this very stressful  period,  but  that  he  was
    never dishonest in his intentions: he was an emotional  wreck,  getting
    through life on  'auto-pilot  mode',  unfocused  and  careless  in  his
    personal tax affairs.

11. On 6 July 2012, the appellant married the second  appellant  in  India.
    The second appellant joined the appellant in the United Kingdom as  his
    dependant on 17 June 2013 and now works for  London  Property  Managers
    Limited.   She would like to use her microbiology degree to make a real
    contribution in the Life Sciences sector but cannot do  so  because  of
    her immigration status.

12. On 17 January 2013, the second appellant entered the United Kingdom  as
    a Tier 1 dependent.  In 2014, with more familial pressures and  a  busy
    self-employment as well as professional life, the appellant employed Mr
    Butt's firm, Tax Maths.  Mr Butt is a Chartered  Certified  Accountant,
    and he spotted the error in the appellant's two tax returns and  helped
    him file amended returns and pay the tax due.  HMRC did  not  impose  a
    penalty.   The appellant need not have paid the tax for 2010/11 but  he
    was keen to set matters right and did so.

13. On 6 June 2016, their daughter was born to  them  here  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  The second appellant was granted leave in line with  that  of
    the principal appellant,  to  expire  on  26  June  2016.   The  second
    appellant has not done anything that she should not have done  and  has
    always resided lawfully in the United Kingdom.

14. On 21 June 2016, the principal appellant applied for further  leave  to
    remain based on  his  private  life  in  the  United  Kingdom.   On  16
    September 2016, he varied his pending application  to  seek  indefinite
    leave to remain with reference to paragraph  276B  of  the  Immigration
    Rules HC 395 (as amended).

15. On 22 February 2017, according to the refusal  letter,  the  respondent
    paused Appendix FM decision making where the minimum income requirement
    was not met or a child was involved,  following  the  decision  of  the
    Supreme Court in MM  (Lebanon)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2017] UKSC 10.  On 10  August  2017,  the  respondent  made
    changes in the Immigration Rules to give effect to  that  judgment  and
    resumed decision making.

16. The appellants have always been lawfully in the United Kingdom and have
    made their applications for further leave to  remain  properly,  before
    the expiry of their previous leave.  They have never overstayed or  had
    any criminal convictions.  There is  evidence  in  the  bundle  of  the
    regard in which they are held by their community, and  the  good  works
    they undertake, none of which is disputed.

17. The appellant feels terrible about his error in the tax returns: he was
    not brought up to be dishonest, having been taught good morals  by  his
    parents from a young age.  The family are paying a high price  for  his
    innocent  mistake,  he  says,  and  he  feels  nearly   suicidal   when
    considering what his carelessness has caused.

Refusal letter

18. On 5 February 2018 for the principal appellant and 11  April  2018  for
    the second appellant, the respondent  refused  their  applications  for
    indefinite leave to remain  made  in  June  2016,  based  on  paragraph
    276ADE(1) with reference to section S-LTR and paragraph 322(5)  of  the
    Rules.

19. The respondent considered that the appellants'  applications  fell  for
    refusal on grounds of suitability, because of the  appellant's  failure
    to declare  to  HMRC  the  full  income  relied  upon  in  his  Tier  1
    applications of �55408.61 in 2010/2011 and �57025  in  2012/2013.   The
    appellant had  declared  only  �22275  for  2010/2011  and  �34872  for
    2012/2013.  If he had used the lower figures, the refusal letter states
    that he would not have been awarded  35  points,  or  any  points,  for
    previous earnings and his applications for Tier 1 leave would have been
    refused.

20. Paragraph 322(5) states that leave to remain and variation of leave  to
    enter should normally be refused in the light of 'the undesirability of
    permitting the person concerned to remain in the United Kingdom in  the
    light of his conduct (including convictions which do  not  fall  within
    paragraph 322(1C), character  or  associations  or  the  fact  that  he
    represents a threat to national security'.

21.  In  this  case,  the  undesirability  relied  upon  was  the  earnings
    discrepancy in the 2010/2011 and 2012/2013 tax  returns  as  originally
    filed.   By the date of decision the  applicant  had  amended  his  tax
    returns for those two years and arranged to pay the unpaid  tax.   HMRC
    did not apply a penalty or prosecute: they accepted the underpaid tax.

22. The respondent accepted that the relationship  between  the  appellants
    was genuine, but neither was settled, and family life was therefore  of
    no assistance.   The respondent considered the citizenship of the child
    under EX.1, treating her as an Indian citizen, and concluded  that  her
    parents could help her settle in India and that she would already  have
    some knowledge of the language, customs and culture of India, making it
    easier to adapt to life there.

23. The respondent did not consider that any exceptional circumstances  had
    been shown for which leave to remain  should  be  granted  outside  the
    Rules.

24. The appellants appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.

First-tier Tribunal decision

25. The appeal was heard in the First-tier Tribunal on 13 November 2018  by
    First-tier Judge Lucas, who allowed the appeal.  Following an appeal by
    the respondent to the Upper Tribunal, the appeal was  remitted  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal for rehearing before a different First-tier Judge.

26. The appeal was reheard in the First-tier Tribunal on 19 September 2019,
    the First-tier Judge finding that  the  principal  appellant  had  been
    dishonest, that his explanation for his conduct  was  implausible,  and
    that the underpayments were so substantial that he must have been aware
    of them.  The appellants' community spirit was taken into  account,  as
    was their daughter's eczema  and  the  difficulties  which  the  Indian
    climate might present in that context.  The First-tier Judge found that
    permitting the principal appellant to remain in the United Kingdom  was
    fatal to the appeals and dismissed them.

27. The appellants appealed to the Upper Tribunal.

Permission to appeal

28. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier  Judge  Andrew.   On  22
    January 2021, Upper Tribunal Judge Plimmer set aside  the  decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal and an intervening decision by  Upper  Tribunal
    Judge Coker, with which we are not here concerned.

29. Upper Tribunal Judge Plimmer ordered that the decision be remade afresh
    in the Upper Tribunal and gave directions  for  skeleton  arguments,  a
    position statement from the respondent, and so on.

Evidence before the Upper Tribunal

30.  The  appellants  filed  a  bundle  of  evidence  (721  pages)  and   a
    supplementary bundle (209 pages),  which  included  witness  statements
    from both appellants and Mr Butt, their accountant.  The principal  and
    second appellants gave evidence.  Mr Butt was released, as his evidence
    was undisputed.

31. There was no provision in Judge Plimmer's order for the filing  of  the
    supplementary bundle and witness statement  which  were  filed  without
    leave, on the Friday before the  hearing  on  Monday  23  August  2021.
    However, Ms Everett did not object to the admission of this bundle.

32. I have had regard to the all of the evidence before me,  in  particular
    those pages and passages to which I was directed at the hearing today.

Upper Tribunal hearing

Mr Usman Butt's evidence

33. Mr Butt provided two witness statements, which stand unchallenged.   On
    10 September 2021 he explained how the error  in  the  appellant's  tax
    returns had come to light, and how he had informed him of the  need  to
    rectify the error and pay the tax.  He confirmed that the appellant had
    paid the shortfall entirely, with interest.  His statement concluded:

         "8.  Having dealt with the appellant's accounts thoroughly, I have,
         in my professional opinion, no doubt  that  the  appellant's  self-
         employment income is genuine.

         9.   It is also entirely plausible that the error in question could
         have occurred, due to the appellant's misunderstanding of  the  tax
         rules, which can often be quite intricate, particularly for clients
         starting a business for the first time and filing their tax returns
         without the help of someone specialising in accounts.  The law does
         allow individuals to make  self-assessment  submissions  themselves
         and we regularly come across such  mistakes,  not  just  from  such
         individuals  like  the  appellant   but   in   some   cases,   from
         professionals working within the field of accounts."

34. In his second witness statement of 8 February 2021, Mr  Butt  confirmed
    his  previous  witness  statement  and  expressed  his  willingness  to
    testify.

Appellants' evidence

35. The appellant adopted his three  witness  statements  of  13  September
    2019, 12 January 2021 and 19 August 2021, summarised under 'Background'
    above.  He recognised that he made a careless mistake in  each  of  the
    Tier 1 (General) applications.  He had not fully  understood  what  was
    deductible and what was not.  He was inexperienced  and  careless,  but
    not dishonest.  He accepted that the tax returns, which he drafted  and
    filed himself, were his responsibility.  He  could  not  now  remember,
    some 10 years later, why he had filled in the deductibles he had.

36. The appellant had not known that money paid out of the business account
    could not be deducted from the gross turnover figure.  He had looked at
    both the business  and  personal  accounts:  that  was  a  question  of
    accidental confusion.

37. At the beginning of her cross-examination, Ms Everett stated  that  the
    respondent maintained her position that the appellant's abilities  were
    such that he could not be heard to say that he did not know how to work
    out the figures for his HMRC tax returns.  However, she did not  cross-
    examine on that area.

38.  Ms  Everett  did  cross-examine  on  the  'new   matter'   about   the
    statelessness of the appellants' daughter.  The appellant said that  he
    did not assume when she was born that she was an Indian citizen: he had
    applied for indefinite leave to remain  and  was  expecting  that  this
    would give his daughter British citizen status. He had  not  taken  any
    legal or community advice on the point.  His daughter  had  never  left
    the United Kingdom, which was 'killing [him]'.  She asked him why  they
    could not go on holidays, but he did not have a passport for her so  it
    was not possible.

39. The appellant did not consider registering his daughter at  the  Indian
    consulate: she was going to be British as soon  as  he  got  indefinite
    leave to remain. That  was  his  intention  at  all  times.   When  the
    indefinite leave to remain application was  refused,  his  whole  world
    collapsed and  his  top  priority  was  to  remove  the  allegation  of
    dishonesty.  He had  had  to  chase  the  respondent  for  a  decision,
    including through his local Member of Parliament.

40. The appellant was clearly very upset when giving his evidence,  and  at
    times tearful.  He could not believe that he had put his family, and in
    particular his 5-year old daughter,  who  was  his  princess,  in  this
    terrible situation.  He would die for her,  her  health  and  happiness
    were his top priority.

41. There was no re-examination.

42. The second appellant  also  gave  evidence.   Again,  she  adopted  the
    evidence in her witness statements.  She had been  outside  with  their
    daughter while the appellant gave evidence but her  answers  in  cross-
    examination were the same as his: she had  never  considered  that  her
    daughter might be an Indian citizen, had taken no advice on  the  point
    and did not think of asking about it.  Her husband was an  honest  man,
    who made an honest mistake.  At all material times,  they  had  thought
    that the child would be British.

43. That concluded the oral evidence for the appellants.

Submissions

Appellants' submissions

44. For the appellants, Mr Biggs filed a helpful skeleton argument, setting
    out the issues for the Upper Tribunal.   He reminded the Upper Tribunal
    of the test in Balajigari and others v Secretary of State for the  Home
    Department [2019] EWCA Civ 673  at  [33]-[44],  which  holds  that  the
    respondent bears  the  burden  of  proof  of  dishonesty,  rather  than
    carelessness,  to  the  ordinary   civil   standard   of   balance   of
    probabilities; and if dishonesty is proved, it is for the  Tribunal  to
    consider whether his presence in the United Kingdom is undesirable; and
    finally, if both points are against the appellant,  the  Tribunal  must
    consider whether the use of paragraph 322(5) requiring  the  appellants
    to leave the United Kingdom constitutes a disproportionate interference
    with their Article 8 ECHR protected rights.

45. Mr Biggs set out seven reasons why the respondent should not  be  found
    to have discharged the burden of proving dishonesty:  the  explanations
    in  the  principal  appellant's  witness  statements;  the  documentary
    evidence supporting it; the witness statement from his  accountant,  Mr
    Butt, who had been instrumental in bringing the  errors  to  light  and
    organising the filing of amended  returns;  the  principal  appellant's
    voluntary amendment of the relevant tax returns , including the payment
    of tax for the 2010/2011 year, although HMRC indicated  that  he  could
    not be compelled to do so; the lack of any penalty imposed by HMRC; the
    character references and DBS certificate, indicating that the principal
    appellant was an honest man; and that there was no  evidence  that  the
    principal appellant had lied to the respondent.  On  the  contrary,  he
    had provided his business bank  account  statements  for  the  relevant
    periods and the invoices  supporting  the  payments  received:  see  RP
    (proof of forgery) Nigeria [2006] UKAIT 00086 at [14].

46. Even  if  dishonesty  were  shown,  the  first  appellant  had  behaved
    responsibly and paid his taxes, albeit late.  The first  appellant  had
    volunteered for the NHS to assist with  the  coronavirus  pandemic  and
    actively  supported  the  United  Kingdom  response  to  the   pandemic
    generally, the free school meals initiative, and the  local  community,
    and he had in the past volunteered for and supported the Red Cross  and
    other charities.  He had provided character references.

47. The second appellant has a Masters degree in Microbiology  with  which,
    once her status was resolved, she would be able to make  a  significant
    contribution to the United Kingdom economy and society.

48. If both dishonesty and undesirability were found, then under Article  8
    ECHR, the appellants would rely on the statelessness of their daughter,
    which meant that she would not be able to travel with  them  to  India,
    and her right to register herself as a British citizen  on that ground.
     It was clearly in the child's best  interests  to  have  both  parents
    available and to grow up here.

49. The appellants were financially self-sufficient and were fluent English
    speakers.  Section 117B(5) was not applicable to family life, but  only
    to private life:  see Rhuppiah  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2018] UKSC 58 at [49].

50. In oral  submissions,  Mr  Biggs  repeated  the  core  of  his  written
    arguments.  The appellant's account  was  perfectly  plausible:  people
    made mistakes and his evidence on the earnings  discrepancy  point  had
    not been tested in cross-examination, nor was there any opportunity  in
    cross-examination for him to respond to the  allegation  that  he  must
    have realised the shortfall in his taxes.  There was no proper basis to
    find that the respondent had discharged the burden upon her of  proving
    dishonesty.  Mr Biggs  reminded  me  that  the  two  spreadsheets,  now
    disclosed, showed how the appellant had calculated his income and  were
    contemporaneous with the incorrect returns.

51. The respondent could not prove that the  appellants'  presence  in  the
    United Kingdom was undesirable.  They both contributed  to  the  United
    Kingdom and local community and had a loving  relationship  with  their
    daughter, a stateless child who was eligible for British citizen status
    on that basis.   The misconduct relied upon was now very  old  and  had
    been remediated  by  the  appellant.   There  had  been  no  subsequent
    problems, indeed no other misconduct at all by either appellant.

52. In relation to Article 8 ECHR and proportionality, Mr Biggs  relied  on
    his skeleton argument and on the lack of challenge to the  evidence  of
    both appellants on  the  earnings  discrepancy  point.   There  was  an
    insurmountable obstacle to return as at the date of  decision  and  the
    date of hearing, their child was stateless.  Her entitlement to British
    citizen  status should weigh heavily in the assessment scales  (see  ZH
    Tanzania v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] UKSC 4  at
    [30]-[34] in the majority opinion of Lady  Hale  JSC,  with  whom  Lord
    Brown JSC and Lord Mance JSC agreed).  The best interests of the  child
    must be a primary consideration.

53. The appellants had an impeccable immigration history, and as far as the
    second appellant was concerned, there was nothing negative against  her
    at all, save by association.  The tax returns had been prepared by  the
    appellant, one of them before she even came to the United  Kingdom  and
    the other shortly  after  her  marriage.   The  error  or  carelessness
    therein had nothing to do with her.

Respondent's submissions

54. Ms Willocks-Briscoe prepared and filed  a  skeleton  argument  for  the
    respondent on 21 October 2020.  However, that skeleton argument  refers
    to the decision of Upper Tribunal  Judge  Coker,  which  has  been  set
    aside.  Ms Everett did not rely on it at the hearing.

55. In oral submissions for  the  respondent,  Ms  Everett  relied  on  the
    refusal letter  and  noted  the  thoroughness  of  Mr  Biggs'  skeleton
    argument.  She submitted that  on  the  evidence,  the  respondent  had
    discharged the burden of showing dishonesty, but conceded that she  had
    to accept that the contemporaneous documents now  before  the  Tribunal
    were supportive, and that the  GCID  showed  that  the  respondent  had
    accepted the income when submitted.  She was in  a  difficult  position
    for that reason.

56. Nevertheless, the earnings discrepancy in the  income  tax  return  had
    conferred a benefit on the appellants.  The Tribunal should not  accept
    the explanation given.  If the Tribunal was satisfied  that  dishonesty
    had been proved to  the  appropriate  standard,  then  as  regards  the
    undesirability  test,  the  respondent  placed  great  weight  on   the
    dishonest act committed.  Good deeds and words were  not  a  sufficient
    corrective counterweight.

57. Ms Everett did not dispute that the  parties'  daughter  was  currently
    stateless and had been since birth.  Article 8 ECHR must be  considered
    in the round.

Analysis

58. The principal question in this appeal is whether the appellant has been
    dishonest, or merely careless.  I have regard to Ms  Everett's  failure
    to cross-examine on this  point,  and  also  to  the  evidence  of  the
    appellant that he was careless and na�ve, at a difficult  time  in  his
    life.  I place weight on Mr Butt's evidence that mistakes of this  type
    are often seen in his practice.  The appellant's error in treating  his
    net turnover as his gross  turnover  led  to  the  error  in  both  tax
    returns.  I am not  satisfied  on  the  evidence  before  me  that  the
    respondent has proved that it was dishonestly done and accordingly, the
    question of undesirability is not reached.

59. Even had it been reached, so far as the second appellant is  concerned,
    the error was not hers  and  she  had  nothing  to  do  with  it.   The
    respondent has not shown that her presence in  the  United  Kingdom  is
    undesirable.  On the contrary, both appellants have done their best  to
    make  a  contribution  to  the  United  Kingdom  and  to  their   local
    communities and charities.  Against a finding of dishonesty, that would
    not have been enough, but absent such a finding, it was not open to the
    respondent to find that their continued presence in the United  Kingdom
    is undesirable.

60. I turn then to Article 8 ECHR.  This is the only area where  I  am  not
    entirely satisfied by the appellants' evidence.  It is  most  odd  that
    they made no attempt to register their daughter at the  Indian  Embassy
    for 5 years after her birth: however, that  is  of  no  legal  account,
    since in MK's case, Mr Ockelton, Vice-President of the  Upper  Tribunal
    (IAC) sitting as a deputy High Court Judge, held that on similar facts,
    the child MK 'was or is 'stateless' at any time when she  did  or  does
    not in fact have Indian nationality'.

61. In this case, the appellants' daughter has never had Indian nationality
    and has been stateless since birth.  She cannot travel anywhere and she
    cannot be expected to remain in the United Kingdom without her parents.
     It is plainly in her section 55 best interests that she have access to
    both parents during her childhood.

62. I therefore find that to remove the  appellants,  or  either  of  them,
    would be a disproportionate breach of the child's Article 8 private and
    family life rights, and further, that her lack of any citizenship is  a
    very significant, indeed an  insurmountable  obstacle  to  this  family
    returning to India together.

63. The appellants' appeals are therefore allowed.



DECISION

64. For the foregoing reasons, my decision is as follows:

    The making of the previous decision involved the making of an error  on
    a point of law.

    I set aside the previous decision.  I remake the decision  by  allowing
    the appellants' appeals.
