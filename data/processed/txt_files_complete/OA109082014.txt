                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This appeal is not subject to an  anonymity  order  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal pursuant to rule 13  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (First-tier
    Tribunal) (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Rules  2014.  Neither  party
    has invited me to make an anonymity order pursuant to rule  14  of  the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  (SI  2008/2698)  and  I
    have not done so.

 2. The appellant appeals against the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge Kershaw) dismissing the appellant's appeal  against  a  decision
    taken on 12 August 2014 to refuse entry clearance  as  a  spouse  under
    paragraph EC-P of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules ("the Rules").

Introduction

 3. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 16 March  1993.  She  is
    married to Mr Moin Hussain who is a UK citizen born on 13 July 1991.

 4. The respondent accepted that the sponsor earned the  annual  equivalent
    of �13,721 from his  employment  with  Clean  Linen  Services  Limited.
    However, the claimed earnings from the sponsor's second employment as a
    carer were only shown in the pay slips and not in the  bank  statements
    submitted. The requirements of paragraphs EC-P.1.1(d) and E-ECP.3.1  of
    Appendix FM were not met. There were no exceptional circumstances  such
    as to justify entry clearance outside the Rules.

 5. The appeal was considered by an entry clearance manager on 18  November
    2914 who concluded that the decision was correct, despite the fact that
    the second employment was paid in cash and the  sponsor  had  submitted
    HMRC evidence showing how much he earned from the second employment  in
    2012-2013. The Rules required that the entire net amount was paid  into
    the sponsor's bank account.

The Appeal

 6. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal and an  oral  hearing
    was listed at Birmingham on 18 February 2015. She was  not  represented
    and the sponsor failed to  attend  the  oral  hearing.  The  First-tier
    Tribunal found that the respondent had correctly interpreted the  Rules
    and  that  any  interference  with  the  right  to  family   life   was
    proportionate.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

 7. The appellant sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on  the
    basis that the First-tier Tribunal had erred in law.  The appellant had
    paid the fee for an oral hearing but the sponsor was  not  notified  of
    the date of the hearing and the documents submitted were not considered
    properly. The respondent said that one wage slip for February 2013  was
    missing but that could easily have been rectified and the sponsor could
    prove the required �18,600 income.

 8. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Holmes on
    17 August 2015 on the basis that the sole basis for  rejection  appears
    to have been the respondent's assertion that a wage slip  for  February
    2013 was missing from the sequence of documents supplied. There was  no
    consideration of paragraph D of Appendix FM-SE by either the respondent
    or the judge.

 9. In a rule 24 response dated 2 September 2015 the  respondent  submitted
    that the issue was that the requirement to show the  second  income  in
    accordance with the Rules was  not  met,  rather  than  just  a  single
    missing wage slip.

10. Thus, the appeal came before me

Discussion

11. The grant of permission is misconceived. The judge  did  not  base  the
    decision on the missing wage  slip,  which  is  not  mentioned  in  the
    reasons for the decision. The decision was based upon  the  absence  of
    any personal bank statements corresponding to the same periods  as  the
    payslips showing that the salary had been paid into an account  in  the
    name of the sponsor, as required by paragraph A1.2.(c) of Appendix  FM-
    SE of the Rules.  The judge suggested at paragraph 21 of  the  decision
    that the sponsor could have shown  money  going  into  the  account  by
    paying a corresponding net amount into the account himself.

12. The respondent and the judge have correctly interpreted and applied the
    Rules. That may appear somewhat harsh to the appellant and the  sponsor
    who have submitted HMRC evidence and payslips in relation to the second
    employment. However, the requirements of Appendix FM-SE are  clear  and
    the sponsor  simply  had  to  pay  the  cash  earned  from  the  second
    employment into his bank account to correspond with the pay slips.

13. I am satisfied that  the  appellant  was  given  notice  of  the  Upper
    Tribunal hearing on 13 October 2015. The sponsor did  not  attend.  The
    appellant is not in the UK and there is no other representative.  I  am
    satisfied that it is in the interests of justice to  proceed  with  the
    hearing. I therefore decide the appeal in the absence of the  appellant
    and the sponsor. The requirements of the Rules are not met. There is no
    evidence of any compelling circumstances such  as  to  justify  further
    consideration of Article 8 outside the Rules.

14. Thus, the First-tier Tribunal's decision  to  dismiss  the  appellant's
    appeal under the Rules and Article 8 did not involve the making  of  an
    error of law and its decision stands.

Decision

15. Consequently, I dismiss the appeal of the appellant.
