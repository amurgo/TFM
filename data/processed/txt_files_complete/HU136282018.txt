                                   Between

                             Mary Jeremiah David
                         (ANONYMITY ORDER NOT MADE)
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. On 30 November 2018, directions were issued to the effect that,  unless
    submissions were made to the contrary, the Upper Tribunal was minded to
    find a material error of law in Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Gibbs'
    decision promulgated on  26  October  2018,  on  the  grounds  that  it
    contained a procedural error/mistakes of fact which amounted to  errors
    of law capable of affecting the outcome of the  appeal.   This  was  by
    reference to pages 3 and 4 of the decision which relied on a  different
    set of background facts to the unchallenged ones  relied  upon  by  the
    Appellant.  The Upper Tribunal was therefore minded to  set  aside  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal and remit it for a de novo  hearing
    before the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. There has been no response to those directions within the  time  period
    allotted from either party.

 3. For the reasons set out in the directions issued and summarised  above,
    I am satisfied that there was a material error of law in  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal such that  it  should  be  set  aside.   The
    decision contains a procedural error  and/or  mistakes  of  fact  which
    amount to material errors of law.

Notice of decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of a material error of law.  As such it is  necessary  to  set  aside
the decision.

I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  and  remit  the  appeal
for a de novo hearing before the First-tier Tribunal (Hatton  Cross  hearing
centre) before any Judge except Judge Gibbs.
