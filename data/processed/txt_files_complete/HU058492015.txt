Anonymity order

The First-tier Tribunal made an order pursuant to Rule 13  of  the  Tribunal
Procedure (First-tier  Tribunal)  (Immigration  and  Asylum  Chamber)  Rules
2014.  I continue that order pursuant to Rule 14 of the  Tribunal  Procedure
(Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008: unless the Upper Tribunal or  a  Court  directs
otherwise, no report  of  these  proceedings  or  any  form  of  publication
thereof  shall  identify  the  original  appellant,  whether   directly   or
indirectly. This order applies to, amongst others, all parties. Any  failure
to comply with this order could give rise to contempt of court proceedings.

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. The appellant appeals with permission against the decision of the  First-
   tier Tribunal dismissing his appeal against the respondent's decision  to
   refuse him leave to remain on human rights grounds.  The appellant  is  a
   citizen of Pakistan.

Background

2. The appellant came to the United Kingdom in 1994 at the age  of  14  with
   his mother, to join his naturalised British citizen father.   His  father
   and mother are still in the  United  Kingdom  together.    The  appellant
   remains a Pakistani citizen.  He last visited Pakistan in 2000,  when  he
   was 20.

3. After joining his father here, the appellant was granted first  leave  to
   remain, and on 15 April 1996, indefinite leave to remain. He was then  16
   years old.  In 1996, his brother was born here, and is a British citizen.



4. The appellant continued to have leave to remain until the failure of  his
   appeal against deportation on 28 January  2011,  which  crystallised  the
   deportation order against him.

5. The appellant got into trouble.  From January 2003, when  he  would  have
   been 22, until May 2008, when he was 27, he was convicted of a number  of
   criminal offences.  He was convicted on 6 occasions  between  24  January
   2003 and 5 October 2006 of 16 offences including  one  property  offence,
   two offences against the police and Courts, one offence of possession  of
   a Class C drug, and twelve driving-related offences.

6.  In  the  summer  of  2006/2007,  the  appellant  committed  offences  of
   obtaining property by deception and conspiracy to do so.  On 15 May 2008,
   the appellant was convicted at Harrow Crown  Court  on  two  counts,  for
   conspiring to  obtain  and  obtaining  property  by  deception.   He  was
   sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment and ordered to pay a total of  �1500
   compensation.

7. On 5 November 2008, the  respondent  served  a  notice  of  liability  to
   automatic deportation pursuant to section 32 and 33 of the UK Borders Act
   2007, and on 10 September  2010,  the  respondent  signed  a  deportation
   order.

8. The appellant had a brief relationship at school in 1998 with  the  woman
   who later became his wife, and is now his former wife.  The  couple  have
   had an on/off relationship. Both sets of parents  disapproved,  and  they
   both married other people, but their marriages failed.  The  relationship
   resumed in 2009, at which time the appellant was still  lawfully  in  the
   United Kingdom.  The appellant proposed to his wife  on  New  Year's  Eve
   2009, and she accepted.

9. The parties  married  in  October  2010,  just  a  few  weeks  after  the
   deportation order was signed.  The appellant's spouse was  aware  of  his
   status.  On 1 August 2012, the  appellant's  wife  gave  birth  to  their
   child.  On 6 September 2012, the respondent detained  the  appellant  for
   just over a month.  He was released on 9 October 2012, but  the  marriage
   failed and during 2012, his estranged wife wrote to the  Home  Office  to
   express 'negative thoughts' about the appellant.

10. In February  2013,  the  appellant's  wife  cut  off  contact  with  the
   appellant, and refused to allow contact between  the  appellant  and  his
   son, who was then 6 months old. The appellant lived with his parents  and
   his younger brother.  The appellant's wife lived with  her  own  parents.
   The appellant's wife instigated divorce proceedings and in October  2014,
   decree absolute was pronounced.

11. Thereafter, it seems that the appellant's former  wife  lived  with  her
   parents and was  supported  by  family  (both  her  own  family  and  the
   appellant's parents and brother) as she raised their son alone.

12. The couple rekindled their relationship after a chance meeting in  April
   2016: the appellant's former wife telephoned him and said she  wanted  to
   reconcile.  Thereafter, contact between the appellant and his son resumed
   and in May 2016, the appellant's former wife moved back in with him.  The
   couple live with the appellant's parents and his younger brother.

13. The appellant had lived with his son, now 4�  years  old,  for  just  10
   months when the appeal was heard by the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge,  but
   the evidence shows that he made persistent  efforts  through  the  family
   courts for contact during the period when he was not  seeing  him.    The
   appellant has made  repeated  attempts  to  have  the  deportation  order
   discharged, without success.  If excluded now from the United Kingdom, he
   will not be permitted to return for 10 years, by which time his son  will
   be 15 years old.

14. Evidence from Ms Dymphna Pearce,  a  social  worker,  confirmed  a  good
   relationship and a strong bond between father and son.  Evidence from the
   child's primary school confirmed that the appellant was on their  records
   as having parental responsibility and was the parent who usually  dropped
   and collected the boy from school.  The evidence of the appellant and his
   partner (whom he has not yet remarried) is that he helps the  child  with
   his homework and puts him to bed, as his partner works full time.

15. The family  still  all  live  together:  the  appellant's  parents,  his
   brother, the appellant himself, and his former wife  and  his  son.   The
   appellant's mother has depression and has been hospitalised, in  December
   2013, when her illness was particularly acute.  She is 50 years  old  and
   has diabetes, with some sight loss. There was no medical evidence  before
   the First-tier Tribunal Judge concerning her physical health.  The First-
   tier Tribunal Judge observed that the appellant's mother  attended  Court
   with her husband and the appellant's younger brother, and that she walked
   into Court unaided.

First-tier Tribunal decision

16. The First-tier Tribunal considered all the  evidence  supplied  and  the
   section 55 best interests of the appellant's son, then 4� years old.  The
   Tribunal did not accept that family life continued to exist  between  the
   appellant and his parents and younger brother, though he did accept  that
   there was private  life  between  them.   The  Tribunal  found  that  the
   Kugathas dependency standard was not reached in the relationships between
   the appellant  and  his  parents  and  brother,  and  in  particular  the
   relationship between the appellant and his mother.

17. As regards the appellant  and  his  former  wife,  now  once  again  his
   partner, at [41] the Tribunal noted  the  intermittent  nature  of  their
   relationship. The appellant's former wife had married him in 2010 in  the
   full knowledge that his status was precarious, as the  deportation  order
   had been signed just a month before the  parties  married.  The  Tribunal
   noted that the appellant's former wife was an educated woman and in full-
   time  employment.   The  Tribunal  noted  that  the  appellant's  contact
   proceedings had been withdrawn in 2016, once the appellant and his former
   wife were again together as a couple.

18. The Tribunal accepted that there was  an  extant  parental  relationship
   between the appellant and the child from May 2016 up to and including the
   hearing in March 2017.  However, he gave weight to the fact that  despite
   his attempts to seek a contact order, the appellant had played no part in
   his son's life from the age of 6 months until the reconciliation with his
   former wife, when the  boy  was  rising  4.   The  Judge  held  that  the
   appellant was not his son's sole carer, although he got him up  and  took
   him to school in the morning, collected him from school in  the  evening,
   and later on gave him supper and put him to bed.

19. The Tribunal considered paragraph 399(a)  and  (b)  of  the  Immigration
   Rules:  there was no suggestion  that  the  appellant's  British  citizen
   child could or should accompany him to Pakistan,  since  his  mother  was
   unwilling to go there.

20. The Tribunal considered, but did not give determinative weight,  to  the
   social worker's report.  The Tribunal took account of the opinion  of  Ms
   Pearce, the social worker, that the relationship between father and child
   was now strong, but did not accept that the  appellant  was  the  child's
   sole carer: the boy lived with his mother, as he  always  had  done,  the
   only difference being that his father lived in the house as well now, and
   helped with his care.

21. The Tribunal held at [47]-[48] that the appellant's son had  only  known
   his father for less than a year and  that  his  mother  had  always  been
   there, coping with  his upbringing with  the  support  both  of  her  own
   parents and of the appellant's family in the United Kingdom.  All members
   of the extended family on both sides were very close to the child.

22. Also at [47], the Judge made the odd assertion that 'the  child  is  too
   young to notice any difference' if the  appellant  were  to  be  removed.
   That is, however, tempered by the subsequent assessment  that  there  had
   indeed been change when the appellant came back into his son's life,  and
   that his son would be able to adapt to losing a father, as he had adapted
   to gaining one.  The test was  not  whether  it  was  desirable  for  the
   appellant to have both parents with him while he grew up, but whether  it
   would be unduly harsh if he did not. At [49], the Judge  stated  that  he
   was 'satisfied that [the boy's] welfare would not be jeopardised with the
   appellant's absence from his life'.

23. At [50], the Tribunal found that the parties' present  relationship  had
   begun in 2016, their marital relationship having ended in 2013, or at the
   latest, 2014.  The 2016 relationship was undertaken  when  the  appellant
   had no leave and was not lawfully in the United  Kingdom.   The  Tribunal
   was not satisfied that there would be very significant obstacles  to  the
   appellant returning to live in Pakistan, where he lived with  his  mother
   up to the age of 14.  He found removal to be proportionate and  dismissed
   the appeal.



Grounds of appeal

24. The grounds of appeal are lengthy, as Mr  Chirico  acknowledged  at  the
   hearing.  They may be summarised thus:

   a) Ground 1.    The First-tier Tribunal failed to make any  reference  to
      the 'very compelling circumstances'  test  in  paragraph  398  of  the
      Immigration Rules, over and above the factors set  out  in  paragraphs
      399-399A thereof.  That was a material, disputed issue  on  which  the
      Tribunal received submissions, but did not make any decision thereon.

   b) Ground 2.    This  ground  is  primarily  a  reasons  challenge.   The
      appellant asserts that the Tribunal's assessment of the best interests
      of his 4� year old child was irrational, particularly having regard to
      the assertion that the child would not notice any  difference  in  his
      absence; that the Tribunal erred in concluding that this appellant was
      not his son's sole carer; and that the Tribunal failed to have  regard
      to the evidence of Mrs Pearce and  the  school.   The  appellant  also
      complained of the Tribunal's suggestion that the recent reconciliation
      between the  parties  might  be  for  the  purposes  of  enabling  the
      appellant to remain in the United Kingdom.

      The  grounds  clarify  that  it  is  not,  and  never  has  been,  the
      appellant's case that his father is his sole carer and to that extent,
      the Tribunal's finding to that effect is said  to  be  irrational  and
      unsupported by any submission by Mr Chirico on the appellant's behalf.

   c) Ground 3.    The appellant contends  that  it  was  not  open  to  the
      Tribunal to find that the appellant's  wife  would  be  able  to  cope
      without him and that, therefore, it  would  not  be  unduly  harsh  to
      expect her to remain in the United Kingdom without him.  The appellant
      contends that the evidence before the Tribunal  was  to  the  contrary
      effect; the appellant's child now  had  a  special  educational  needs
      diagnosis and if the appellant were not in  the  United  Kingdom,  she
      would have to give up work, which would have a wider social effect  as
      she is herself a special needs teacher.

   d) Ground 4.    The appellant argues that it was not open to the Tribunal
      to find that the appellant did not enjoy family life with his  mother.
      In particular,  the  Judge  erred  in  taking  into  account  his  own
      observation of the mother at the First-tier Tribunal hearing,  and  in
      preferring that to the report by the social worker; failed to consider
      that the appellant's mother had  brought  him  up  until  he  was  14;
      placed too much emphasis on his finding that the mother was not an old
      woman, at 50 years of age; and gave insufficient weight to the medical
      evidence of Dr Gupta that the appellant's mother  had  serious  mental
      health problems which had resulted in her being an  in-patient  on  at
      least one occasion.   The appellant observes  that  the  finding  that
      there was 'no  medical  report  about  [the  mother's]  condition'  is
      erroneous in fact, as there was before the Tribunal a report  from  Dr
      Gupta about her mental health.



Permission to appeal

25. Permission to appeal was granted by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Adams,
   for the following reasons:

         "2.  It is arguable that in coming to his conclusions the  Tribunal
         failed to find whether there were any very compelling circumstances
         that would render his deportation disproportionate.  Further, it is
         an arguable error of law that  in  coming  to  his  conclusions  in
         relation to  the  test  interests  of  the  child,  the  Tribunal's
         findings are inadequate for the reasons referred to in ground 2  of
         the application.  It is also an arguable  error  of  law  that  the
         Tribunal did not give adequate reasons for finding the  appellant's
         partner would be able to cope without him and did not take note  of
         the fact that it would impact on society if his mother had to  give
         up work.  In addition, the Tribunal made findings  in  relation  to
         the appellant's mother based on his own opinion.  He did  not  take
         note of the medical evidence before him."

26.  The effect of the grant of  permission  is  that  all  grounds  may  be
   argued.

Rule 24 Reply

27. The respondent opposed the grant of permission.  Her opposition  may  be
   summarised as follows:

   a) She relied on the decisions in Hashem Ali,  NE-A,  and  ZP  (India)  v
      Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  [2015]  EWCA  Civ  596,
      arguing  that  the  'very  compelling  circumstances'   test   was   a
      proportionality exercise  in  which  the  appellant  must  demonstrate
      circumstances at the 'very  compelling'  level  which  outweighed  the
      public interest in deportation.  She relied on AD Lee v  Secretary  of
      State for the  Home  Department  [2011]  EWCA  Civ  348  and  Danso  v
      Secretary of State for the Home Department [2015] EWCA Civ  596.   The
      prescribed period of 10 years would  run  only  from  the  appellant's
      actual departure from the  United  Kingdom  and  the  period  of  good
      behaviour since sentence was of no relevance to that.

   b) As regards the section 55 best interests of the child and  the  399(a)
      test, the grounds were no more than a disagreement with the Tribunal's
      findings.  The Tribunal had  been  entitled  to  give  weight  to  the
      brevity  of  the  father-son  relationship  on  the  facts   of   this
      application.

   c) The Tribunal had given clear reasons for finding that the  appellant's
      former wife would be able to cope in his absence if he was removed.

   d) The Tribunal had not erred in finding that the appellant had failed to
      discharge the burden upon  him  of  showing  that  family  life  still
      existed  between  the  appellant  and  his  mother.   There   was   no
      corroborative evidence and  the  appellant's  grounds  relied  on  the
      strength of the pre-1994 bond between mother and son, before they both
      rejoined his father in the United Kingdom.  The  appellant's  mother's
      mental  illness  was  of  no  assistance  to  him   without   Kugathas
      dependency, and her needs had been met by her husband, son and  others
      while the appellant was in prison.

Upper Tribunal hearing

28. At the beginning of  the  hearing,  Mr  Chirico  handed  up  a  document
   described as 'note for hearing' which was in effect both an  addendum  to
   his 21 March 2017 skeleton argument, and his reply  to  the  respondent's
   Rule 24 Reply.  This document is really no more than a joinder  of  issue
   on the respondent's Rule 24 Reply arguments.  I have had regard to it but
   there is no need to set it out in detail here.

29. That is the basis on which this appeal came before the Upper Tribunal.

Submissions

30. I received oral submissions from the parties at the  hearing.   For  the
   appellant, Mr Chirico relied on his skeleton argument of March  2017  and
   on the Note already mentioned.  He argued that  the  appellant's  offence
   was an old conviction and the sentences imposed (12 months concurrent  on
   two counts) were short.  The respondent's continuing  failure  to  revoke
   the deportation order would cause family  breakup  which,  he  contended,
   would impact directly on the  best  interests  of  the  appellant's  son.
   There had been a 3-year delay by the respondent in making a  decision  on
   the appellant's application to revoke the deportation decision, which had
   made matters worse.  The First-tier Tribunal had not made any  cumulative
   assessment of private and family life in this case, which was an error of
   law.

31. The Tribunal had, in fact, failed to engage with the evidence before  it
   and taken a very negative approach to the  reconciliation  between  these
   parents, which was a good thing, for them and for their child.  The  Home
   Office had not disputed the medical evidence  regarding  the  appellant's
   mother, nor her oral evidence.  The appellant's former wife  had  flight-
   related anxiety which meant that she could not travel  to  Pakistan  with
   him.

32. For the respondent, Mr Kotas said that  adequate  explanation  had  been
   given on the Kugathas point in the First-tier Tribunal decision, and  the
   finding that there was no extant family life between this appellant as an
   adult, and his mother, father, or brother was one which was open  to  the
   Tribunal to make, on the evidence before  it.   Mr  Kotas  observed  that
   there was no challenge in the grounds of appeal to  the  finding  by  the
   First-tier Tribunal that there  were  no  significant  obstacles  to  the
   appellant's reintegration in Pakistan if he were to be returned there.

33. As regards the section 55 best interests of the  appellant's  child,  it
   was not perverse for the Tribunal to  have  concluded  that  the  primary
   parent here was the appellant's former wife, who had  always  been  there
   for their child.  The appellant had been absent from his child's life for
   the first 3 years and  the  relationship  between  the  parents  was  not
   consistent, but off/on over a number of years.

34. Mr Kotas noted that the First-tier Tribunal  had  applied  an  erroneous
   approach to the "unduly harsh" test relying (albeit not expressly) on the
   guidance in the Upper Tribunal decision in MAB (para 399; "unduly harsh")
   [2015] UKUT 435 (IAC), which had subsequently  been  disapproved  by  the
   Court of Appeal in MM (Uganda) & Anor v Secretary of State for  the  Home
   Department [2016] EWCA Civ 617. Mr Kotas argued, however, that this error
   was in the appellant's favour  and  immaterial  to  the  outcome  of  the
   appeal, since even with his criminality out of account, the appeal failed
   on paragraph 399 before the First-tier Tribunal.

35. The only area of real concern in the grounds of appeal  was  the  First-
   tier Tribunal's  omission to deal expressly  with  the  'very  compelling
   circumstances' exception in paragraph 398, with regard to Part 5A of  the
   Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  (as  amended).   The  Upper
   Tribunal should consider what might be  the  content  of  any  compelling
   exceptional circumstances relied upon here: it appeared that the  factors
   relied upon were private and family life, which  could  be  given  little
   weight under section 117B of the 2002 Act, particularly  as  the  parties
   had married  after  the  signing  of  the  deportation  order,  with  the
   appellant's former wife well aware of his status.

36. Mr Kotas relied on the decision of the Court of Appeal in  SS  (Nigeria)
   v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] EWCA Civ 550 in which
   the factual matrix was arguably similar  to  the  present  appeal.    The
   appellant in SS (Nigeria) had not succeeded.  Lord Justice  Laws,  giving
   the decision of the Court in that case had said that the public  interest
   in deportation could only be displaced by  a  very  strong  claim  indeed
   under Article 8 ECHR.

37. In reply, Mr Chirico  explained  that  the  appellant's  case  on  'very
   compelling circumstances' related to his age on  arrival  in  the  United
   Kingdom (14) and to the 22 years he spent  here,  16  of  them  lawfully.
   Unless  the  Tribunal  could  entirely  exclude  the  possibility  of  an
   immigration Judge allowing the appeal, which  the  appellant  argued  was
   perverse, then it was material that the Tribunal had omitted to  consider
   very compelling circumstances.  The respondent had to show  that  it  was
   not material, and that, in these circumstances, was a very high  bar  for
   her to overcome.

38. As regards the ability of the appellant's former wife  to  cope  in  his
   absence, there was evidence before the Tribunal that she had not found it
   easy.   The  independent  social  worker's  report  was  helpful  to  the
   appellant on this point.  The appellant would rely on [38] in Hesham Ali,
   and argued that it would be unduly harsh for the appellant's former  wife
   and child to remain in the United Kingdom without him, and that the  best
   interests of the child required his father  to  remain.   The  First-tier
   Tribunal's decision at [45] did not even consider that argument.

39. The appellant also maintained his argument  concerning  extended  family
   life with the other adults in the appellant's birth family.

The Immigration Rules

40. The Immigration Rules, so  far  as  relevant  to  this  appeal,  are  as
   follows:

         "398. Where  a  person  claims  that  their  deportation  would  be
         contrary to the UK's obligations  under  Article  8  of  the  Human
         Rights Convention, and ...

         (b) the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive  to  the
         public good and in the  public  interest  because  they  have  been
         convicted of an offence for which they have  been  sentenced  to  a
         period of imprisonment of less than 4 years but at least 12 months;
         ...
         the Secretary of  State  in  assessing  that  claim  will  consider
         whether paragraph 399 or 399A applies and,  if  it  does  not,  the
         public interest in deportation will only  be  outweighed  by  other
         factors where there are  very  compelling  circumstances  over  and
         above those described in paragraphs 399 and 399A.

         399. This paragraph applies where paragraph 398 (b) or (c)  applies
         if -
             (a)  the  person  has  a  genuine  and   subsisting   parental
             relationship with a child under the age of 18 years who is  in
             the UK, and
                  (i) the child is a British Citizen; or ... and  in  either
                  case
                  (a) it would be unduly harsh for the child to live in  the
                  country to which the person is to be deported; and
                  (b) it would be unduly harsh for the child  to  remain  in
                  the UK without the person who is to be deported; or


             (b) the person has a genuine and subsisting relationship  with
             a partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen or settled
             in the UK, and
                  (i) the relationship was formed at a time when the  person
                  (deportee) was in the UK lawfully  and  their  immigration
                  status was not precarious; and
                  (ii) it would be unduly harsh for that partner to live  in
                  the country to which the person is to be deported, because
                  of compelling circumstances over and above those described
                  in paragraph EX.2. of Appendix FM; and
                  (iii) it would be unduly harsh for that partner to  remain
                  in the UK without the person who is to be deported.

         399A. This paragraph applies where paragraph 398(b) or (c)  applies
         if -
             (a) the person has been lawfully resident in the UK  for  most
             of his life; and
             (b) he is socially and culturally integrated in the UK; and
             (c)  there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles   to   his
             integration into the country to which it  is  proposed  he  is
             deported."                                   [Emphasis added]

Discussion

41. The appellant is a person to  whom  paragraph  398(b)  applies  and  the
   respondent, and  therefore  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  are  required  to
   consider the provisions of paragraphs 399 and paragraph  399A.   Only  if
   neither of those paragraphs avails the appellant  does  the  question  in
   paragraph 398 of the existence of "very compelling circumstances over and
   above those described in paragraphs 399 and 399A" arise.  The appellant's
   primary case is that it does arise, and much of the  argument  before  me
   concerned the absence of a "very compelling circumstances" finding in the
   decision.

42. I begin, therefore, by dealing with grounds 2 and 3, which  engage  with
   the First-Tier Tribunal's reasoning under paragraphs  399  and  399A.   I
   note, as Mr Kotas observed, that the grounds of appeal do  not  challenge
   the finding that  there  are  no  'very  significant  obstacles'  to  the
   appellant's integration into Pakistan.   To the extent that such argument
   has been raised in the appellant's  skeleton  argument,  or  in  argument
   before me, it is irrelevant since there was no application to  amend  the
   grounds.  If the appellant  cannot  bring  himself  within  sub-paragraph
   399A(c) then his argument under paragraph 399A must fail and the Tribunal
   did not err in so holding.

43. I return, therefore, to the challenges under paragraph 399(a)  and  (b).
   It is not disputed that as British citizens, the appellant's former  wife
   and his son cannot be required or expected to live in Pakistan, and  that
   the appellant's former wife is not willing to go there, or to allow their
   son to do so.  Despite the misgivings expressed by the  Tribunal  in  his
   decision, the respondent does not seek to  assert  that  the  appellant's
   relationship with his former wife and/or their child is  not  genuine  or
   subsisting.

44.  Therefore,  for  the  purposes  of  this  decision,  the  determinative
   question is whether it would be unduly harsh for the  appellant's  former
   wife or his child to remain in the United Kingdom without him.  At  [42]-
   [51] in the decision, the First-tier Tribunal gave  reasons  for  finding
   that it would not be unduly harsh for the appellant's former wife, or his
   child, to remain in the  United  Kingdom  without  him.   She  had  coped
   without him for over 3 years, the relationship having  broken  down  when
   the baby was 6 months old, but not resumed until he was rising 4.

45. The appellant says that the Tribunal failed to give adequate  weight  to
   the social worker's report.  The weight to be given to expert evidence is
   for the fact-finding Tribunal, and its findings of fact  thereon  can  be
   displaced only in the circumstances set out by Lord Justice Brooke  in  R
   (Iran) at [90], that  is  to  say,  the  findings  must  be  contrary  to
   evidence, perverse, Wednesbury unreasonable, or incomprehensible  to  the
   reviewing Judge.  The First-tier Tribunal's findings under paragraph  399
   are none of those things, and it was open to the Judge to find  that  the
   social worker's report was  not  determinative  of  the  issue  of  undue
   harshness.  This, therefore, is a case where neither  paragraphs  399  or
   399A of the Rules avail the appellant.

46. One returns, therefore, to consider  whether  at  the  date  of  hearing
   there were 'very compelling circumstances' over and above those  provided
   for in paragraphs 399 or 399A, which  outweigh  the  public  interest  in
   deportation.  That is a high standard, and well beyond the 'not doomed to
   fail' test advanced by Mr Chirico in argument at the hearing.  It  cannot
   be met by consideration of the social  consequences  of  the  appellant's
   former wife giving up  her  job  as  a  special  needs  teacher,  nor  by
   consideration of the relationship between the appellant and his child, or
   his former wife, both of which are provided for in paragraphs 399  and/or
   399A.

47. There remains the question  of  private  and  family  life  between  the
   appellant and his parents and younger brother.  All of the members of his
   family group are now adults.  The appellant cannot be heard to  say  that
   the bond he had with his mother when  a  child,  before  he  lived  in  a
   household with his father, meets  the  Kugathas  test:  the  point  about
   Kugathas dependency is that it is between adults, because there is always
   dependency between a minor child and his parents.  It is  right,  as  the
   First-tier Tribunal recognised, that  the  appellant  lives  in  a  joint
   family household with his parents,  brother,  his  former  wife  and  his
   child.  However, the head of that family  household  is  the  appellant's
   father, and it was unarguably open to the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  to
   consider that the appellant's father was the  primary  resource  for  his
   mother.

48. The First-tier Tribunal did take account of the mental  health  evidence
   regarding the mother.  The inelegant observation by the Judge that  there
   was 'no medical evidence' about her condition, read in  context,  plainly
   refers to the lack of any evidence to  corroborate  the  account  of  her
   physical health (diabetes and sight loss).  That is the only  context  in
   which how she walked into Court (on the arm of her husband  and  brother)
   can have been relevant.  I have not seen any medical evidence  about  the
   mother's physical health but given the other family support she has,  and
   the lack of Kugathas family life between her  and  the  appellant,  I  am
   satisfied that the First-tier Tribunal did not err  in  considering  that
   the private life which the appellant has with his  other  family  members
   was insufficient to outweigh the public interest in deportation  of  this
   appellant.

49. Mr Chirico argues that the appellant's last offence was a long time  ago
   and the sentence only 12 months, and that he has been rehabilitated since
   2008.  I am guided by the judgment of Lord Justice Moore-Bick  in  Danso,
   giving the judgment of the Court, at [20]:

         "20.     ... I should  not  wish  to  diminish  the  importance  of
         rehabilitation. It may be that in a few cases it will amount to  an
         important factor, but the fact is that  there  is  nothing  unusual
         about the appellant's case. ... It must be borne in mind,  however,
         that the protection of the  public  from  harm  by  way  of  future
         offending is only one of the factors that makes it conducive to the
         public good to deport criminals. Other factors include the need  to
         mark the public's revulsion at the offender's conduct and the  need
         to  deter  others  from  acting  in  a  similar  way.  Fortunately,
         rehabilitation of the kind exhibited by the appellant in this  case
         is not uncommon and cannot in my view  contribute  greatly  to  the
         existence of the very compelling circumstances required to outweigh
         the public interest in deportation. ...

         22.  ...I  have  sought  to  identify  the  factors  on  which  the
         appellant can rely as militating against his deportation.  None  of
         them is unusual either in nature or degree; nor could  it  possibly
         be  said  that  taken  together  they  amount  to  very  compelling
         circumstances of a kind that could outweigh the public interest  in
         deportation."

50. That is also the position in  this  appeal.   The  circumstances  relied
   upon, both within paragraphs  399  and  399A,  and  over  and  above  the
   circumstances provided for in those paragraphs, are  not  unusual.   This
   young man came to the United Kingdom as a teenager; got into  trouble  up
   to and including the 1-year sentence on two offences in 2008, when he was
   28 years old; and has stayed out  of  trouble  since  then.   He  has  an
   intermittent  relationship  with  his  former  wife,  and  a  brief   but
   affectionate relationship with his very young son,  both  of  which  were
   properly considered by the First-tier Tribunal, as was  his  relationship
   with his parents and  brother.   Even  taken  together,  nothing  in  his
   narrative amounts to very compelling circumstances of a kind which  could
   outweigh the statutorily reinforced public  interest  in  deportation  of
   foreign criminals.

51. I deal finally, and for completeness, with the MAB error of law  posited
   by Mr Kotas at the hearing, but not presaged either  in  the  grounds  of
   appeal or by way of a cross-appeal.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  at  [46],
   when assessing whether the appellant's removal would  have  unduly  harsh
   effects on his son,  erred  in  a  self-direction  that  the  appellant's
   criminality should not form part of the proportionality assessment  made.



52. That was the approach in MAB, disapproved by  the  Court  of  Appeal  at
   [26] in MM (Uganda).  The proper approach was  identified  by  the  Upper
   Tribunal in KMO (section 117 - unduly harsh) [2015] UKUT 543 (IAC):

         "The  Immigration  Rules,  when  applied  in  the  context  of  the
         deportation of a foreign criminal, are a complete  code.  Where  an
         assessment is required to be made as to whether a person meets  the
         requirements  of  para  399  of  the  Immigration  Rules,  as  that
         comprises an assessment of that person's claim under article  8  of
         the  ECHR,  it  is  necessary  to  have  regard,  in  making   that
         assessment, to the matters to which the Tribunal must  have  regard
         as a consequence of the provisions of s117C. In  particular,  those
         include that the more serious the offence committed, the greater is
         the  public  interest  in  deportation  of  a   foreign   criminal.
         Therefore, the word "unduly" in the phrase "unduly harsh"  requires
         consideration of whether, in the light of the  seriousness  of  the
         offences committed by the foreign criminal and the public  interest
         considerations that come  into  play,  the  impact  on  the  child,
         children or partner of  the  foreign  criminal  being  deported  is
         inordinately or excessively harsh."


53. In MM (Uganda), Lord Justice Laws, giving the  judgment  of  the  Court,
   held in terms that the MAB approach was wrong and that

         "26. ...The expression "unduly harsh" in section 117C(5)  and  Rule
         399(a) and (b) requires regard to be had to all  the  circumstances
         including the criminal's immigration and criminal history."

   The error made is in the appellant's favour and is, therefore, immaterial
   to the outcome of this appeal, since even with that error, the appeal was
   dismissed.

DECISION

54. For the foregoing reasons, my decision is as follows:
   The making of the previous decision involved the making of an error on  a
   point of law.
   I do not set aside the decision but order that it shall stand.
