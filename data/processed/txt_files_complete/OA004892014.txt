Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr A Chohan, Counsel, instructed by Immigration
                    Chambers (Ilford)
For the Respondent:    Mr A C Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant,  a  citizen  of  Pakistan,  born  on  21  January  1993,
    appealed against a decision of the Entry Clearance Officer,  Islamabad,
    made on 4 December 2013 to refuse an  application  for  an  EEA  family
    permit as the other family member of  a  German  national,  Mr  Khurram
    Javaid, who is exercising Treaty rights in  Britain.   His  appeal  was
    heard by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Talbot on 13 April  2015  and
    dismissed.  The appellant now appeals, with  permission,  against  that
    decision.

2.   In paragraph 7 onwards of the  determination  the  judge  set  out  the
    facts in this case,  stating  that  the  sponsor  was  the  appellant's
    maternal uncle who has lived in Germany between 1998 and 2011  when  he
    had relocated to Britain.  He had obtained German nationality in  2004.
    He lives here with his wife and three young children and his parents in
    a rented four bedroom house  working  as  a  security  officer  earning
    between �1,000 - �1,200 per month.  His wife works in a boutique.   The
    appellant lives in Pakistan with his parents and two younger  siblings.
    His father had worked as a store man in a factory  for  about  nineteen
    years and the appellant has been attending university  since  2011  and
    was due to finish his degree in 2015.  For the first three years of his
    life the appellant had lived  apart  from  his  parents  as  they  were
    working in another city: he had lived with  his  maternal  grandparents
    and the sponsor.  After 1998 he had continued to live with his parents,
    siblings and grandparents and about ten to fifteen years ago the family
    had moved to their current home in Lahore which had been  purchased  by
    his grandparents.  His grandparents had joined the sponsor  in  Britain
    in August 2013 and the appellant continued to live with his parents and
    siblings in the same accommodation.  They do not pay any  rent  to  the
    appellant's grandparents.

3.   As the sponsor is an only son he  has  been  nominated  to  become  the
    owner of the house in Lahore when his parents die.  He has control over
    the house and when repairs are  to  be  done  he  sends  money  to  the
    appellant's parents to pay the costs.

4.   It was claimed that the sponsor had a particularly  close  relationship
    with the appellant as he had lived with him when he was small  and  was
    therefore sending money to him which he intended  particularly  to  pay
    for his studies as the appellant's father did not earn much  and  would
    not be able to afford the costs.  The evidence was that since July 2013
    the sponsor had been sending monthly amounts of �100  through  a  money
    transfers service directly into the appellant's bank account.  Prior to
    that the  sponsor  was  sending  money  through  people  travelling  to
    Pakistan.

5.   The judge noted that the application for a family permit had been  made
    so that the appellant could visit the sponsor in Britain for two months
    during his university holidays as they had not wanted him to  miss  any
    of his education, but while he was here the sponsor wanted him  to  use
    his time to look over courses  in  Britain  with  a  possible  view  to
    continuing his studies over here.

6.   The refusal  stated  that  the  appellant  was  not  a  member  of  the
    sponsor's household and lived in a  property  that  was  owned  by  his
    grandparents and there was no supporting  evidence  to  show  that  the
    sponsor paid the household bills.  There was insufficient  evidence  of
    dependency on the sponsor who himself earned a modest  income  and  the
    appellant's day-to-day needs appeared to be met by  his  father:  these
    were merely supplemented by the  sponsor who paid his university fees.

7.   At paragraphs 15 onwards the judge set out his findings.

8.   In considering the position of extended family members he  referred  to
    the decision of the Court of Appeal in Bigia [2009] EWCA Civ 79 and the
    Upper Tribunal determinations  in  MR  (Bangladesh)  [2010]  UKUT  449,
    Moneke (Nigeria) [2011] UKUT 00341 and Ihemedu  (Nigeira)  [2011]  UKUT
    00340.

9.   He noted the amended wording of Regulation 8(2)  which  made  it  clear
    that it was not necessary for an appellant to have resided  in  another
    EU state  where  the  sponsor  was  also  resident.   However,  it  was
    necessary for the appellant to establish that he was a  member  of  the
    sponsor's household or dependent upon him.

10.  The judge then went on to set out the conclusions of  the  Tribunal  in
    Moneke and the  meaning  of  the  dependency  in  the  context  of  the
    Regulations.   In particular he noted that financial dependency was  to
    be interpreted meaning the person needed financial support from the EEA
    national in order to meet his or her essential needs, not in order to a
    certain level of income.

11.  He quoted from the determination in Moneke where it was stated that:

         "Nevertheless when ... able bodied people of mature years claim  to
         have always been dependent upon remittances from  a  sponsor,  that
         may invite particular close scrutiny as to why this should  be  the
         case. We  note  further  that  Article  10(2)(e)  of  the  Citizens
         Directive contemplates documentary evidence. Whether dependency can
         ever be proved by oral testimony alone is  not  something  that  we
         have to decide in this case, but Article 10(2)(e) does suggest that
         the responsibility is on the applicant to satisfy the Secretary  of
         State by cogent evidence that is in  part  documented  and  can  be
         tested as to whether the level of material  support,  its  duration
         and its impact  upon  the  applicant  combined  together  meet  the
         material definition of dependency."

12.  Applying the guidance in the cases which he had cited  the  judge  then
    went on, in  paragraphs  23  onwards,  to  set  out  his  findings  and
    conclusions.  He accepted that the appellant had been a member  of  the
    sponsor's household prior to his relocation to Germany in 1998  but  at
    that time the sponsor was not an EEA  national  and  so  that  was  not
    relevant to the appellant's entitlement under the Regulations.  He went
    on to say that it was equally clear that the appellant had not  been  a
    member of the sponsor's household since  the  sponsor  acquired  German
    nationality in 2004. The fact that the sponsor had  been  nominated  to
    inherit the property in which the appellant and his parents are  living
    when his grandparents died did not mean that the appellant was a member
    of the household of the sponsor who lived thousands of miles away.

13.  He then  focused  on  the  issue  of  dependency  and  the  documentary
    evidence which had been provided and stated in paragraphs 25 onwards:

         "25. There is  evidence  before  me  (in  the  form  of  remittance
             invoices and  the  appellant's  bank  statements)  of  regular
             monthly remittance of �100 by the  sponsor  to  the  appellant
             from 27.7.13 up to the present. However, I need to assess  the
             material evidence or decency  at  or  prior  to  the  date  of
             decision (4.12.13) and cannot therefore consider post decision
             evidence (Except insofar as it sheds light on the situation at
             the date of decision).  The  only  documentation  constituting
             supporting evidence of dependency at or  before  the  date  of
             decision is therefore the evidence of monthly remittances from
             the end of July 2013.  I an  not  satisfied  on  the  evidence
             before me that regular remittances were sent for the appellant
             before that date.  The sponsor said that he sent money through
             people travelling to Pakistan but is not clear how often  this
             occurred.  Nor  is  it  clear  why  he  would  not  have  made
             remittances through money transfer arrangements  before  July,
             if he wished to make regular payments.

         26.  Both the sponsor and  the  appellant  himself  said  in  their
             witness statements that he (the appellant) had been  dependent
             on his uncle since his childhood. If  this  was  the  case,  I
             would expect to have more supporting  evidence  of  this.  The
             sponsor was keen to emphasise  that  he  had  control  of  his
             father's house in which the  appellant  and  his  parents  are
             living, but failed to properly explain how  this  control  was
             exercised. He gave one example of paying repair bills for  the
             house but there  was  no  supporting  evidence  of  this.  The
             sponsor  stated that the money he sent his nephew was not just
             to cover his study costs but there was no detail  as  to  what
             additional expenses his payments were designed to cover. Given
             that the sponsor  himself  has  a  fairly  modest  income  (as
             indicated by his receipt of housing benefit and tax  credits),
             I do not accept that he would have sent money to the appellant
             which was not earmarked for particular purposes. I accept that
             the appellant's father earns a modest income and I accept that
             the sponsor has taken it on himself to  support  his  nephew's
             higher education studies  in  Pakistan.   However,  I  do  not
             accept that the sums sent by  the  sponsor  are  to  meet  his
             'essential living needs' and I do not consider it most  likely
             that  it  is  his  own  father  who  is  responsible  for  his
             maintenance in this respect. Taking into account the  judicial
             guidance quoted above, I therefore conclude that the appellant
             has failed to provide sufficient evidence of dependency within
             the meaning of the EEA Regulations and he therefore  does  not
             qualify as an 'extended family member'. For these  reasons  he
             is not entitled to an EEA Family Permit."

14.  The grounds of appeal pointed to the fact that the judge had said  that
    he was satisfied that the appellant was a member of the household prior
    to the sponsor's relocation to  Germany  but  that  he  had  failed  to
    consider the evidence that the sponsor had acquired German  nationality
    in 2004, had travelled to Pakistan on a number  of  occasions  and  had
    lived in Pakistan for three years between 2008 and  2011  during  which
    time the appellant had been a member of the sponsor's household.

15.  They went on to say that the sponsor had been nominated to inherit  the
    house in Pakistan and the fact that there were no remittance slips  was
    because during the period between 2008 and  2011  the  sponsor  was  in
    Pakistan. They asserted that the appellant had been  dependent  on  the
    sponsor since childhood.  It was stated that the judge  had  failed  to
    calculate  the  income  and  had  failed  to  take  into  account   the
    consideration that the appellant had two other  siblings  in  whom  the
    appellant's father was financially maintaining from his  income.   They
    were also in education and calculating their  tuition  fees  and  their
    living expenses it was clearly acceptable that the appellant's father's
    income alone would not be  enough  for  the  appellant  to  manage  his
    studies and living costs.

16.  Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  A
    K Simpson who focussed on the fact that the judge had not  specifically
    referred to the period between 2008 and 2011 when the sponsor had  been
    in Pakistan.

17.  At the hearing of the appeal before me Mr Chohan  emphasised  that  the
    appellant's  mother,  father  and  siblings  lived  in   the   maternal
    grandfather's house and that the  maternal  grandparents  had  come  to
    Britain in  2013  to  live  with  the  sponsor.   He  stated  that  the
    grandfather of the appellant had been the head  of  the  household  and
    that he had owned the house and that money had been sent to him  before
    he came to Britain to maintain the household.  The  appellant's  father
    worked in a factory as a manual labourer and the maintenance  had  been
    for the appellant's education rather than to sustain the household.  He
    referred to the evidence before the judge that the sponsor had lived in
    Pakistan between 2008 and 2011 and  emphasised  that  the  sponsor  had
    maintained the appellant since childhood, supporting the  household  in
    Pakistan and supporting the appellant's parents. He argued that it  was
    for the judge to ask further questions  regarding  the  income  of  the
    sponsor and the money which had been sent to Pakistan.  He stated  that
    there was  enough  evidence  however  to  show  that  the  sponsor  was
    maintaining the appellant.

18.  In reply, Mr Avery stated that there was a lack of evidence to  support
    the assertions made and stated there  was  nothing  to  show  that  the
    sponsor had lived in the same house when he had returned  to  Pakistan.
    He emphasised that the household  was  that  of  the  grandparents  and
    stated that the appellant had not discharged the burden of  proof  upon
    him.

Discussion

19.  With the grounds of appeal there was some further documentary  evidence
    produced showing that certain repairs to the house had been paid for by
    the sponsor and also statements from  the  sponsor  and  the  sponsor's
    father - the  appellant's  grandfather.   The  appellant's  grandfather
    stated that:

         "My son would send money on my name when  I  was  in  Pakistan  for
         Mohammed Haseeb Javaid.  As Mohammed Haseeb Javaid was  a  minor  I
         would receive money on  his  behalf  for  his  studies  and  living
         costs."

20.  There were also some payment slips for the sponsor which postdated  the
    decision and before the hearing some bank statements had been  produced
    as well as photographs of the appellant and the sponsor.

21.  However, the documentary  evidence  that  had  been  before  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer and before the judge included only a bank  statement,
    a sponsorship declaration and evidence that the sponsor is seeking work
    in Britain.

22.  It is clear from the determination in  Moneke  that  detailed  evidence
    needs to be provided to show dependency  and  sufficient  to  bring  an
    appellant into the category of extended family member. That evidence is
    simply lacking in this case.  There are no detailed  schedules  showing
    the money which was sent to Pakistan and when it was sent, what income,
    if any, the sponsor had while in Pakistan between  2008  and  2011  and
    indeed what surplus income he has after  providing  for  his  wife  and
    children and the rent for a four bedroom house as well as providing for
    his parents here which would enable him to maintain  the  appellant  in
    Pakistan.  This is particularly relevant given the very modest earnings
    of the sponsor.

23,  Mr Chohan appeared to argue that it was for  the  judge  to  have  made
    enquiries regarding the sponsor's  income  and  indeed  other  relevant
    matters, but the reality is that it is for the appellant to prepare his
    own case and to show how he meets the requirements of the Regulations.

24.  The reality appears to be that the head of the household in  which  the
    appellant was living was his grandfather who owned the  house  and,  of
    course,  still  does.   It  was  only  in  2013  that  the  appellant's
    grandparents joined the sponsor in Britain.  While it is accepted  that
    money  was  sent  to  Pakistan  to  the  appellant's  grandfather,  the
    likelihood surely that that money went to the  appellant's  grandfather
    to spend on maintaining the household and not merely for the appellant.
     But in any event the  evidence  of  what  money  was  sent  is  scant.
    Moreover, the reality is that the appellant's father appears always  to
    have worked. While it may well  be  the  case  that  his  earnings  are
    modest, there is nothing to indicate that he  is  not  paying  for  the
    essential needs of his family including the appellant.

25.  It is up to the appellant to put forward cogent evidence to  show  that
    his essential needs were being met by the sponsor rather than by  other
    family members.  The relevant evidence of remittances and the  detailed
    analysis of the family's budget and indeed that of the sponsor here has
    simply not  been  provided  and  the  burden  of  proof  has  not  been
    discharged by the appellant.

26.  It is clear from the file that the judge recorded the  evidence  before
    him.  While there is evidence that the sponsor spent time  in  Pakistan
    between 2008 and 2011,  there  is  nothing  to  indicate  that  he  was
    supporting the household during that time.  Indeed, there is nothing to
    show that he was living in the household at that time  other  than  the
    assertions made by him at the hearing.  That however I consider is  not
    a material matter when there is so little evidence to show that  it  is
    the sponsor who is maintaining the appellant and providing for anything
    other than his university fees and I consider that the  conclusions  of
    the judge were entirely correct and in particular his statement that he
    did not accept that the sums sent by  the  sponsor  were  to  meet  the
    appellant's "essential living needs".

27.  I therefore find that  there  is  no  material  error  of  law  in  the
    determination of the Judge of the Fist-tier Tribunal and find that  his
    decision dismissing this appeal shall stand.
