Representation:

For the Appellant:     Miss Qureshi, Counsel, instructed by 12
      Bridge Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Tufan (Home Office Presenting
      Officer)

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellants, born September 26, 1983, July 21,  1980,  September  3,
    1984 and April 20, 1980 respectively, are citizens of India. The  first
    and second appellants are husband and wife as are the third and  fourth
    appellants.


 2. The second and fourth appellants have applied to remain in  the  United
    Kingdom as tier  1  (Entrepreneur)  Migrants  under  the  points  based
    system. The first and third appellants are their dependants.

 3. Their immigration history is as follows:

     a. The second appellant  entered  the  United  Kingdom  as  a  Tier  4
        (General) Student on September 14, 2009 with leave to remain  as  a
        student until March 31, 2011. He switched to tier  1  (Post  Study)
        Migrant status on March 4, 2011 and he was given leave to remain on
        that basis until March 4, 2013. On January 23, 2013 he applied vary
        his leave to remain as a Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)  migrant  but  the
        respondent refused this on September 13, 2013 and at the same  time
        issued a decision to remove him by way of  directions  pursuant  to
        Section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and nationality Act 2006.


     b. The first appellant had been granted leave to enter  as  a  Tier  1
        (Post study) partner from October 16, 2011 until March 4, 2013. She
        was a dependant on his current application.

     c. The fourth appellant entered the United Kingdom  as  a  student  on
        June 11, 2008 with leave to remain as a student until  December  4,
        2008. He was granted further leave to remain as a student and  Tier
        4 (General) student until April 17, 2011. He  switched  to  tier  1
        (Post Study) Migrant status on March 8, 2011 and he was given leave
        to remain on that basis until March 8, 2013. On January 24, 2013 he
        applied vary his leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) migrant
        but the respondent refused this on September 13, 2013  and  at  the
        same time issued a decision to remove  him  by  way  of  directions
        pursuant to Section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum  and  nationality
        Act 2006.

     d. The third appellant had been granted leave to enter  as  a  student
        dependant on March 18, 2010 valid until July 31, 2010. She was then
        granted leave in line with her husband.

 4. The respondent refused the substantive applications because she was not
    satisfied-


     a. The second and fourth appellants genuinely intended and  were  able
        to establish, take over  or  become  a  director  of  one  or  more
        businesses within the next six months; or
     b. The second and fourth appellants had genuinely  established,  taken
        over or become a director of one or more businesses in  the  United
        Kingdom and continue to operate that business.
     c. The second and fourth appellants genuinely intended to  invest  the
        money referred to in Table 4 of Appendix in the business.
     d. The money referred to in Table  was  genuinely  available  to  them
        until such time as the money was spent by the business.
     e. They did not intend to take employment other than under  the  terms
        of paragraph 245DE HC 395.
     f. The application was refused under paragraph 245DD(h) having  regard
        to the evidence submitted.

 5. On September 27, 2013 the appellants appealed under  Section  82(1)  of
    the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

 6. The matter was listed before Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  Britton
    (hereinafter referred to as "the FtTJ") on  March  7,  2014  and  in  a
    determination promulgated on March 27, 2014 he  dismissed  the  appeals
    under the Immigration Rules and human rights.

 7. The appellants appealed that decision on April 2, 2014.  Permission  to
    appeal was granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal White  on  April
    14, 2014 who found it was arguable the FtTJ had  erred  by  failing  to
    take into account and/or failing to make adequate findings in regard to
    the evidence submitted by the appellants.

 8.  The  second  and  fourth  appellants  were  in  attendance   and   the
    representatives  outlined  their  submissions  for  me.  Miss   Qureshi
    confirmed that she did not  intend  to  make  any  submissions  on  any
    possible error under article 8 and her submissions would be confined to
    whether the FtTJ had erred in finding the appellants were  not  genuine
    entrepreneurs.

    SUBMISSIONS ON ERROR OF LAW


 9. Miss Qureshi submitted:

     a. The FtTJ's findings were inadequate and were confined to 7 lines in
        paragraphs [38] and [39] of the determination  n.   These  findings
        were insufficient in light of the fact  there  had  been  over  394
        pages of evidence submitted.


     b. The FtTJ only had regard to the fact they had  other  jobs  at  the
        date of their application and failed to  take  into  account  their
        evidence that they would devote  100%  of  their  energies  to  the
        business once their visas were granted.

     c. The FtTJ failed to have regard to the  fact  the  business  made  a
        �40,000 profit in  the  first  year  and  he  wrongly  assumed  the
        appellants were working full-time when in fact one  appellant  only
        work three days a week (30 hours) and the worked 30 hours a week.

     d. The FtTJ's assessment of the evidence was deficient.


10. Mr Tufan relied on the rule 24 letter dated May 21, 2014 and  submitted
    there was no error in law.  He  submitted  the  FtTJ  agreed  with  the
    respondent that they were not genuine entrepreneurs. He  gave  adequate
    reasons in paragraphs [38] and [39] and whilst they  were  brief  there
    was no reason for the  FtTJ  to  have  to  give  lengthy  reasons.  His
    findings were not irrational. The FtTJ had to  be  satisfied  that  the
    appellants intended to comply with the Rules  and  on  the  balance  of
    probabilities he was not satisfied.

11. I reserved my decision having clarified that  the  genuineness  of  the
    appellant's intentions to the business was the only issue.

    ERROR OF LAW ASSESSMENT


12.  The FtTJ had a considerable amount of paperwork  before  him  and  the
    main challenge to this decision is that he failed to make  findings  or
    have regard to that evidence when making  his  findings  in  paragraphs
    [37] to [39] of his determination.


13. In assessing whether any error has been made I find it helpful  to  set
    out those paragraphs because they were his findings and it explains why
    he reached the decision he did.

           "37. I have taken into account all the evidence before  me.  The
           appellants have produced a very impressive Indo Corner  Business
           Plan. They say that they sat down together and prepared the plan
           and were able to look at other plans and to incorporate some  of
           those ideas into their own plan. They were  in  school  together
           and both came to this country to study. They  have  formed  this
           company, which was incorporated in October 2012. The company has
           the HSBC bank account. The appellants state that they have  four
           contracts, one in Spain. They say the  wholesaler  and  retailer
           they had met at a party.


           38. The respondent states simply that  this  is  not  a  genuine
           entrepreneurial business but a business to enable them  to  stay
           in this country. They conduct  business  from  their  home.  The
           landlord has no objection and they are able to  cut  costs  that
           way. They both work full time, one for  Sports  Direct  and  the
           other for McDonalds. Being full-time does not give them a  great
           deal of time on their own business, especially as they wanted to
           tap into the European market. Onkar Singh in his interview  with
           the Home Office said he works on average 40-50  hours  per  week
           (Q.64). Jaspreet Singh stated that  he  was  employed  full-time
           with McDonalds (Q.64).  I  find  that  if  the  appellants  were
           seriously engaged, as they state, in their plan, and that  there
           is a need to fill a niche market  of  speciality  and  authentic
           Asian products, establishing a relationship with  customers  and
           developing handcraft Asian products by working  full-time,  they
           would need to go out and obtain contracts in a very  competitive
           market (emphasis added). They say they would be able  to  supply
           Asian groceries to small businesses like Takeaways and where the
           larger companies would not be able to compete with them  because
           they would be smaller and would give better  personal,  face  to
           face service to the smaller client. At the moment they say  they
           mainly go to two wholesalers who send the products direct to the
           small outlets. The appellants do  not  have  any  storage  space
           themselves. I find that the appellants would have difficulty  in
           competing with the present suppliers if they have to go  to  the
           wholesalers, then distribute the goods as the small outlets  can
           go direct to the wholesalers to obtain  their  goods  and  there
           would be little  profit  margin  for  the  appellants  (emphasis
           added). Also they said about obtaining the goods from India  and
           Pakistan. The appellants have not set out the cost implications.
           The costs involved would make it difficult for them  to  compete
           against the many competitors in the market, which they accept.


           39. I am not satisfied that this  is  a  realistic  and  genuine
           business. If it was, they would put far more energy  into  their
           customers and not work full-time at Sports Direct and McDonalds.
           They say they want to go into Europe but they have  little  time
           to do so. I have  taken  into  consideration  all  the  evidence
           submitted by  the  appellants  and  respondent.  Also  the  oral
           evidence  of  the  first  and  third  appellants.  I  find   the
           appellants are using Indo Corner Ltd as a means of remaining  in
           this country. I also find they have no intention  of  giving  up
           the full time employment. The company  began  its  operation  in
           October 2012. If the appellants were serious in building up  the
           business they would have been out aggressively finding customers
           in a very competitive market. I do not accept  that  this  is  a
           genuine entrepreneurial business (emphasis added)."

14. Miss Qureshi  has  submitted  the  FtTJ  did  not  demonstrate  he  had
    considered all of the documents or evidence and Judge of the First-tier
    Tribunal gave permission to appeal on this very issue.


15. I am satisfied the FtTJ considered all of the documents.  He  confirmed
    as much in paragraphs [37] and [39]. In the latter paragraph  the  FtTJ
    went further and stated he also had regard to the oral evidence of  the
    two entrepreneurs.

16. I have looked at the documents that  were  before  the  FtTJ.  The  two
    witness statements reiterate that they were committed to  the  business
    and that in the past  twelve  months  they  turned  over  �40,000  (not
    profit). The FtTJ acknowledged what they had done but  still  concluded
    the business was not a genuine entrepreneurial business.

17. In assessing whether the FtTJ has given adequate consideration  to  the
    bundle of documents it has been necessary  for  me  to  consider  those
    documents myself.

18. A tax return and accounts for the period November 1,  2012  to  October
    31, 2013 were provided and quarterly unaudited accounts  were  provided
    covering the period November  1,  2013  to  February  2014.  The  gross
    profits for the period to October 31, 2013  was  �20,543  but  the  net
    profit was only �595. The  quarterly  turnover  to  February  2014  was
    �15,733 with a net loss of �702. It is clear the  FtTJ  had  regard  to
    these matters because he assessed the business levels of  the  business
    and made findings in paragraphs [38] to [39].

19. Whilst there  are  VAT  returns  and  purchase  invoices  these  merely
    demonstrate a level of business activity. The FtTJ clearly was aware of
    this level of business as he addressed this in his determination.

20. This is not a case where the FtTJ found there was no business. What  he
    did  doubt  was  the  genuineness  of  the  business  itself  and   the
    appellants' intentions. The FtTJ had to have regard to  the  fact  that
    any person who wished to remain as an entrepreneur was doing so on that
    basis alone and if he believed the appellants intended to earn a living
    through other means and were not genuine entrepreneurs then that was  a
    finding open to him as long as there was some evidence to base  such  a
    finding on.

21. The bank statements and  affidavits  confirmed  that  monies  totalling
    �50,200 had been invested and  a  bank  statement  showed  that  as  at
    January 28, 2014 the balance in the account remained at �40,425.

22.  The FtTJ had regard to the business plan and sales forecast. The level
    of projected revenue and income  was  significantly  different  to  the
    actual accounts and again the FtTJ was aware of this.

23. In summary, the FtTJ was fully au fait with the  company's  income  and
    profit levels and he also was aware of the entrepreneurs'  employments.
    He took a view, like the respondent, the  business  was  a  vehicle  to
    extend their stay in the United  Kingdom.  He  concluded  the  business
    operated but he was clearly not satisfied the entrepreneurs would  take
    no employment, other than working for the business or businesses  which
    he has established, joined or taken over.

24. Miss Qureshi argued the FtTJ failed to have regard  to  their  evidence
    that they would work full-time in the business if the visa was  granted
    but this was something the FtTJ clearly rejected. In paragraph [39]  he
    clearly rejected their evidence that they would work full-time  in  the
    business and this was something that was open to him.

25. The bundle of documents was  voluminous  and  they  showed  a  business
    existed. It was however a business which did not produce the  level  of
    expected income outlined in the business plan and the accounts show the
    business lost money in the quarter to February 2014 and  this  followed
    on from a small profit of �595  for  the  whole  previous  twelve-month
    period. There was no evidence that this business could afford  to  make
    any payments to the entrepreneurs and the accounts  confirmed  no  such
    payments.

26. I am satisfied the FtTJ, whilst not setting on any substantial  detail,
    did have regard to all of the matters and he was entitled to  make  the
    findings he did. He has explained his reasons and  they  were  open  to
    him. He was entitled to reject their appeal.

27. As stated Miss Quereshi did not pursue any error of law in  respect  of
    article 8 and in those circumstances I find no error.

    DECISION


28. There is no material error of  law  and  the  original  decision  shall
    stand.

29. Under Rule 14(1) The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (as
    amended) the  appellant  can  be  granted  anonymity  throughout  these
    proceedings, unless and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise. No
    order has been made and no request for an order was submitted to me.
