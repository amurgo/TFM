Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Winter, Advocate, instructed by Gray & Co,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DTERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Zimbabwe, born on [ ] 1983.

 2. The respondent refused the appellant's claim on  protection  and  other
    grounds for reasons explained in her letter dated 12 July 2016.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Blair dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal  by
    determination promulgated on 29 March 2017.

 4. The first ground of appeal to the UT is that the judge erred at �22 -24
    by not referring to submissions made on  a  report  to  the  police  in
    Zimbabwe of a missing person, made in  an  election  week  when  abuses
    peak, and by finding no coherent explanation for discrepancies  arising
    from the report.

 5. I advised at the hearing on 7 November that I found no  merit  in  this
    ground.  As Mr Matthews submitted, the background evidence on which  it
    is founded does nothing to explain away the discrepancies  between  the
    report and the evidence from the appellant and her husband, or to  show
    why the report might be falsified on points of detail.  This is no more
    than disagreement on a factual matter which the judge was  entitled  to
    resolve as he did.

 6. Ground 2 (which was plainly the reason for  the  grant  of  permission)
    disclosed failure to resolve the appeal in terms of �276ADE (vi) of the
    immigration rules.

 7. The appellant had not suggested that remaking of the decision  on  this
    issue involved any further hearing of evidence, and had not applied  to
    introduce any further evidence; but Mr Matthews had been handicapped in
    preparation for that eventuality by the  absence  of  the  respondent's
    file containing the underlying evidence.

 8. On the view that only ground 2 was  established,  parties  agreed  that
    remaking of the decision was apt to take place in the UT at  a  further
    hearing.

 9. A decision on error of law was issued, setting aside  the  decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal.  That decision recorded it  as  common  ground
    that (although decided in the context of �399A rather than  276ADE)  on
    "integration" the starting point is at �14 of SSHD v Kamara [2016] EWCA
    Civ:
           ... the concept of a foreign criminal's "integration"  into  the
           country to which it is proposed that he be deported, as set  out
           in section 117C(4)(c) and paragraph 399A, is a broad one. It  is
           not confined to the mere ability to find a  job  or  to  sustain
           life while living in the other country. It is not appropriate to
           treat the statutory language as subject to  some  gloss  and  it
           will usually be sufficient for a court  or  tribunal  simply  to
           direct itself in the terms that Parliament has  chosen  to  use.
           The idea of "integration" calls for a broad evaluative  judgment
           to be made as to whether the individual will  be  enough  of  an
           insider in terms of understanding how life  in  the  society  in
           that other country is carried on and a capacity  to  participate
           in it, so as to have a reasonable  opportunity  to  be  accepted
           there, to be able to operate  on  a  day-to-day  basis  in  that
           society and to build up within a reasonable time  a  variety  of
           human  relationships  to  give  substance  to  the  individual's
           private or family life.

10. Notice was issued of a further hearing, for submissions on the remaking
    of the decision (in terms only of �276ADE of the rules), on 29 November
    2017.

11. Under cover of a letter dated 28 November 2017, the appellant  provided
    counsel's skeleton argument "and an inventory of productions upon which
    we intend to rely at the hearing".

12. The productions include further evidence - some simply  updating,  some
    general background, but also new evidence about the  appellant's  uncle
    in Zimbabwe.

13. Mr Matthews opposed the admission of any new evidence.

14. There was considerable force in that objection, given  the  history  of
    the case to date; non-compliance with rule 15 (2A) and with  directions
    issued earlier in the case; and  the  very  late  stage  at  which  the
    evidence was tendered.

15. By way of background, there were two other cases on the day's list,  in
    which even more seriously defective  applications  were  made  (through
    other agents).  As the hearing day developed, however, it was  possible
    to give Mr Matthews time to consider the  evidence,  and  although  the
    respondent's opposition was not withdrawn, the evidence was admitted.

16. The appellant's skeleton argument refers to Kamara (above).  It  refers
    also to Ogondimu [2013] Imm AR 422,  on  the  view  that  although  the
    wording of  the  rule  has  changed,  factors  mentioned  there  remain
    relevant: time spent in the country where the person would have to  go;
    age at which the person  left;  exposure  to  that  country's  cultural
    norms; whether she speaks the  language  of  that  country;  extent  of
    family and friends in that country, and quality of  relationships  with
    them.

17. I understood  Mr  Matthews  to  agree  with  that  submission,  so  the
    applicable law is not in any dispute.

18. Mr Winter's submissions were along the lines of the skeleton  argument,
    grouped around these points:

          i) Current political instability in Zimbabwe.

         ii) Length of residence of the appellant in the UK (since 2001).

        iii) Situation of her husband and child, her  dependants  in  these
             proceedings.

         iv) Lack of family ties  in  Zimbabwe  (mother  in  law  in  South
             Africa; mother, brother and sister all settled in the UK).

          v) Economic  situation  in  Zimbabwe  (references  to  background
             evidence given).

         vi) Appellant's child never having lived in Zimbabwe.

        vii) Appellant's child attending nursery in the UK.

       viii) Appellant and child's close bonds with family in the UK.

         ix) Appellant's family in UK also have children.

          x) No accommodation to return to in Zimbabwe.

         xi) Conditions to be faced by appellant  and  family  in  Zimbabwe
             (background references given).

        xii) Employment prospects poor (background references given).

       xiii) Living conditions to be faced (background references given).

19. The principal points I took  from  the  respondent's  submissions  were
    these:

          i) Remaking of the decision was confined to a discrete issue.

         ii) There was no challenge to the FTT's resolution of the claim on
             article 8 grounds, which  incorporated  consideration  of  the
             best interests of the child.

        iii) The only  challenge  brought  by  the  appellant  against  the
             outcome on protection grounds had been resolved against her.

         iv) Those adverse findings were relevant to the outcome on the one
             outstanding issue.

          v) Standing the FTT's findings on humanitarian protection and  on
             article 3, the same factors could not lead to success  on  the
             private  life  basis  of  "very   significant   obstacles   to
             integration".  That  was  not  an  easier  legal  alternative,
             available on the same facts.   It set a high bar.

         vi) The appellant had been found not  to  be  a  credible  witness
             regarding the alleged detention of her  husband's  father  and
             her mother-in-law's flight  to  South  Africa.  There  was  no
             reason to credit her current claims to have no  useful  family
             connections in Zimbabwe.   In respect of her husband's family,
             the starting point was to the contrary.

        vii) The appellant would not be returning to  Zimbabwe  alone.  The
             presumption was that she would return  with  her  husband  and
             their daughter. Based on the  FtT's  findings,  her  husband's
             father was a government official, likely to  be  comparatively
             advantaged.

       viii) The appellant included in her new inventory of  productions  a
             letter and copy  documents  from  an  uncle,  to  promote  her
             allegations of likely deprivation, but the information  showed
             that he was benefiting from private medical health  treatment,
             which was available only to the relatively favoured few.

         ix) Although President Mugabe has recently left office, there  was
             no evidence of a politically deteriorating situation, such  as
             might cause the appellant any difficulty in integration.

          x) The appellant speaks English, the principal common language in
             Zimbabwe.  Her screening interview record shows that she  also
             speaks Shona, the other principal language of the majority.

         xi) The appellant grew up and  reached  the  age  of  majority  in
             Zimbabwe.

        xii) The appellant has continued  to  live  among  members  of  the
             Zimbabwean diaspora.

       xiii) There was no reason to think that the appellant would  not  be
             well attuned to the cultural norms of the country.

        xiv) There was no reason to accept the  appellant's  assertions  of
             the extent of deprivation and lack of family contact to  which
             she would be exposed.

         xv) The appellant would have  the  benefit  of  returning  with  a
             package  provided  by  the  respondent  to  help  re-establish
             yourself and to obtain employment and housing.

        xvi)  There  were  undoubtedly  difficulties   over   housing   and
             employment in Zimbabwe, but  the  appellant  and  her  husband
             would be relatively advantaged rather than disadvantaged.

20. Mr Winter in response submitted thus:

          i) It was irrelevant to refer to the appellant's poor immigration
             history.

         ii) Absence of a challenge to findings on humanitarian  protection
             and  article  3  grounds  did  not  resolve   the   issue   of
             integration.

        iii) The respondent sought  to  interpret  the  evidence  from  the
             appellant's uncle to show that circumstances were not  as  bad
             as painted,  but  notably  his  letter  referred  to  "Nigel",
             presumably another close relative [a cousin, perhaps?], having
             to leave the country for South Africa.

         iv) Provision of a package  by  the  respondent  was  meant  as  a
             cushion or a starting base, not to ensure longer term support,
             or integration.

          v) The evidence of difficulties over  housing  and  accommodation
             was that these apply not only to the deprived few, but to  the
             mass of the population.

21. I reserved my determination.

22. Having followed up the appellant's background references, there  is  no
    doubt that the situation in Zimbabwe remains bleak for the majority  of
    the population - which is why so many  of  them  have  left  for  South
    Africa, the UK and elsewhere.

23. The factors which the appellant prayed in aid illustrate her great (and
    understandable) reluctance  to  relocate  herself  and  her  family  to
    Zimbabwe, and the preferability of life in the UK; but they do no  more
    than that.  They do not bear significantly on the issue of integration.

24. The appellant has advanced everything she could, but  the  argument  on
    her side is effectively rebutted by the respondent's  submissions.   On
    the essential question of  integration  -  the  "insider  or  outsider"
    question - there is really nothing in her favour.

25. Far from there  being  obstacles  to  the  appellant's  integration  in
    Zimbabwe,  still  less  "significant"  or  "very   significant"   ones,
    everything points to her being an insider not an  outsider,  and  to  a
    relatively easy adjustment, substantially assisted by the respondent.

26. The appellant's appeal, as brought to the  FtT,  is  dismissed  on  all
    available grounds.

27. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
