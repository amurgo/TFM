                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. An anonymity order was not requested and I see no need to make one.

 2. The three appellants are Dutch  nationals  born  on  22  May  2002,  12
    November 2006 and 7 April 2009.

 3. On 19 May 2014 they applied for certification of permanent residence as
    children of an EEA national exercising Treaty rights.  The  application
    was refused on the basis that they had not provided evidence of  having
    resided in the UK for a continuous period of five years as required  by
    Regulation 15(1) of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.

 4. The appellants appealed and their appeal was considered  by  First-tier
    Tribunal ("FtT") Judge Obhi on the papers. In a decision promulgated on
    6 March 2015 the FtT dismissed the appeal on the basis that  there  was
    insufficient evidence to find the appellants had been living in the  UK
    for the requisite period.

 5. In the grounds of appeal the appellants stated that documents which had
    been sent to the FtT on 11 July 2014 by fax had not been considered  by
    the judge.  They  provided  evidence  that  these  documents  had  been
    submitted.

 6. At the error of law hearing the  appellants  (their  mother  acting  on
    their behalf) handed to the Tribunal copies of the documents  that  had
    been submitted on 11 July 2014. These included:

      a. In respect of the appellant born on 22 May 2002, a letter from  the
         local authority dated June 2008 and school reports from 2009 - 2013

      b. In respect of the appellant born on 12  November  2006,  a  medical
         appointment letter  dated April 2009 and school reports from 2012 -
         2014

      c. In respect of the appellant born on 7 April 2009,  a  letter  dated
         January 2010 from a health visitor, a  medical  appointment  letter
         dated June 2012 and a 2014 school report.

Consideration

 7. The appellants are entitled to confirmation of  a  right  to  permanent
    residence in the UK in accordance with Regulation 15(1)  if  they  have
    resided continuously in the UK for five years. On  11  July  2014  they
    submitted evidence to  the  FtT  to  show  their  continued  residence.
    Unfortunately, that evidence was not on the file when  the  appeal  was
    considered on 24 February 2015.

 8. Failure to take this evidence into account, although  plainly  not  the
    fault of the FtT judge considering the appeal, amounts to an  error  of
    law. The aforementioned evidence, as described in  paragraph  6  above,
    shows, on the balance of probabilities, that the three appellants  have
    resided in the  UK  for  five  years  such  that  Regulation  15(1)  is
    satisfied. No argument  was  made  by  Mr  Staunton  to  the  contrary.
    Accordingly, I remake the decision to allow the appeals  of  all  three
    appellants.

Decision

 a. The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the  making  of  a
    material error of law and is set aside.

 b. I remake the decision and allow the appeals.

 c. No anonymity order is made.
