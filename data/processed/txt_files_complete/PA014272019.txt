                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     Mr Diwnycz, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms Khan, Legal Justice Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. JMA says that he is Eritrean. The Secretary of State  does  not  accept
    that he is.  This appeal is concerned with that dispute.

    Background and Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

 2. JMA claimed asylum on the 15th November 2016. He told officers that  he
    was an Eritrean national and that he feared  serious  ill-treatment  if
    returned there - he had left  illegally  and  this  would  be  punished
    severely,  with  adverse  political  opinion  being  imputed   to   his
    behaviour.

 3. Protection was refused on the 31st January 2019.  For  the  purpose  of
    this appeal the material part of the Secretary of State's reasoning was
    as follows [at �19]:

         "You  were  interviewed  on  23  January  2019  and   during   your
         substantive interview you were asked a number of questions so  that
         I could establish your  nationality  and  identity.  However,  your
         responses were either inaccurate or incorrect when compared to  the
         background information about Eritrea, therefore your claim to be  a
         national of Eritrea is considered unknown  for  the  reasons  given
         below.."

 4. The letter then  lists  the  information  provided  by  JMA  which  the
    Secretary of State believed  to  be  inaccurate,  and  this  conclusion
    reached [at �28]:

         "Your asylum and/or human rights claim is  based  upon  an  alleged
         fear in Eritrea. For the reasons given above  it  is  not  accepted
         that you are a national of Eritrea nor that you have established  a
         real risk of persecution or a breach of the ECHR  in  Eritrea.  You
         will be removed to Ethiopia as this is the country which  you  have
         lived in for the majority of your life, were educated in, worked in
         and speak the official language of".

 5. It will be observed that the Secretary of State  nowhere  asserts  that
    JMA is Ethiopian. She simply notes that on his  own  account  he  spent
    much of his childhood there, and so she believes that he can be removed
    to that country.

 6. In its written decision of the 14th August 2019 the First-tier Tribunal
    (Judges Saffer and O'Hanlon) recorded the  opening  statements  of  the
    respective representatives as follows [at �20]:

         "Both representatives accepted that the key issue for determination
         for the Tribunal was the issue of the Appellant's nationality.  The
         Presenting Officer confirmed that if the Tribunal  found  that  the
         Appellant was from Eritrea, he would not be returned there".

 7. This latter submission appears to have been interpreted by  the  First-
    tier Tribunal as a concession that if JMA is  Eritrean,  then  he  will
    have made out his claim to be a refugee. Before me Mr Diwnycz was  able
    to confirm that this interpretation was correct.  Although  it  is  not
    articulated the factual basis of this concession is that a man of JMA's
    age is very likely to have left Eritrea illegally and  having  done  so
    would be perceived as a politically-motivated  draft  dodger:  MST  and
    Others (national service - risk categories) Eritrea CG [2016] UKUT  443
    (IAC).

 8. At paragraph 14 of its decision the First-tier Tribunal directed itself
    that the standard of proof applicable in asylum appeals is one of 'real
    risk'. At  paragraphs  26-37  the  Tribunal  weighs  up  the  competing
    evidence and [at �38] it concludes:

         "Having considered all of the evidence before us in the  round  and
         notwithstanding the inconsistencies previously referred to  in  the
         Appellant's account, we are satisfied to the requisite standard  of
         proof  that  the  Appellant  is  from  Eritrea.  In  reaching   our
         conclusion we have placed particular reliance upon  the  fact  that
         the Appellant was able to answer many of the questions put  to  him
         in his asylum interview about Eritrea, and the  fact  that  he  has
         throughout his various accounts maintained the core of  his  claim,
         namely that he was taken by his parents from Eritrea to Ethiopia at
         the age of  2 years and the fact that  the  Appellant  is  able  to
         speak Tigrinya, the language of Eritrea, to a  sufficient  standard
         to be able to give a detailed medical history with  the  assistance
         of a Tigrinya interpreter in the preparation of the medical  report
         dated 29th March 2019. We therefore find to the requisite  standard
         of proof that the  Appellant  has  demonstrated  that  he  is  from
         Eritrea and that he has  a  well-founded  fear  of  persecution  on
         return to Eritrea and we therefore  find  that  the  Appellant  has
         established that he is a refugee."

    The appeal was thereby allowed.




    The Secretary of State's Appeal

 9. The Secretary of State's primary contention is that the decision of the
    First-tier Tribunal is "wholly unlawful"  for  an  application  of  the
    incorrect standard of proof. It is submitted that the standard was  not
    'real risk' but the balance of probabilities. The  Secretary  of  State
    relies, in  support  for  this  proposition,  on  the  decision  in  MA
    (Ethiopia) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2009] EWCA Civ
    289.

10. It is further submitted that  the  Tribunal  erred  in  treating  JMA's
    ability to speak Tigrinya as "virtually determinative" of the  question
    of his nationality.

11. Permission to appeal was refused by First-tier Tribunal  Lever  on  the
    18th September 2019 but granted, upon  renewed  application,  by  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Grubb on the 2nd October 2019.




    Discussion and Findings

12. The passages in MA (Ethiopia) cited in the grounds  of  appeal  are  as
    follows:

         "49.     However, this is a highly unusual case in which it  became
         apparent during  the  hearing  before  the  AIT  that  the  outcome
         depended upon whether the Ethiopian  authorities  would  allow  the
         appellant to return to Ethiopia. I do not  accept  the  appellant's
         submission that the AIT simply had to determine  this  question  to
         the usual standard of proof. It is a question which can,  at  least
         in this case, be put to the  test.  There  is  no  reason  why  the
         appellant should not herself  make  a  formal  application  to  the
         embassy to seek to obtain  the  relevant  documents.  If  she  were
         refused, or she came up against  a  brick  wall  and  there  was  a
         failure to respond to the request within a reasonable  period  such
         that a refusal could properly be inferred, the  issue  would  arise
         why she had been refused. Again, reasons might  be  given  for  the
         refusal.  Speculation  by  the  AIT  about  the  embassy's   likely
         response, and reliance on expert evidence designed to  assist  them
         to speculate in a more informed manner about that  question,  would
         not be necessary.

         50.      In my judgment, where the essential issue before  the  AIT
         is whether someone will or  will  not  be  returned,  the  Tribunal
         should in the normal case require the applicant to  act  bona  fide
         and take all reasonably practicable steps to  seek  to  obtain  the
         requisite documents to enable her to return.  There  may  be  cases
         where it  would  be  unreasonable  to  require  this,  such  as  if
         disclosure of identity might put the applicant at risk, or  perhaps
         third parties, such as relatives of the applicant  who  may  be  at
         risk in the home state if  it  is  known  that  the  applicant  has
         claimed asylum. That is not this case, however. There is no  reason
         why the appellant should not herself visit the embassy to  seek  to
         obtain the relevant papers. Indeed, as I have said, she did so  but
         wrongly told the staff there that she was Eritrean."

13. The Secretary of State relied upon these passages to submit first, that
    the applicable standard of proof was the 'balance of probabilities' and
    second, that JMA had failed to demonstrate that he had made a bona fide
    attempt to obtain nationality documents from the Ethiopian embassy  (he
    had gone there but claimed that consular staff had refused to issue him
    with any paperwork).

14. In response to this challenge Ms Khan submitted that the author of  the
    grounds had fundamentally misunderstood the effect of the  decision  in
    MA on protection appeals such as this. The question in this appeal  was
    not, as Elias LJ had framed it [at his �50]  in  MA,  "whether  someone
    will or will not be returned", it was whether or not JMA  had  a  well-
    founded fear of persecution in Eritrea. The standard applicable to that
    question was indisputably the lower test of 'real risk' or  'reasonable
    likelihood', and it manifestly did not require the putative refugee  to
    visit any embassies.

15. That this is so is apparent from the context  in  MA  as  well  as  the
    judgment itself. MA was an Ethiopian of Eritrean origin.  By  the  time
    that her appeal had its third outing in the Upper Tribunal the issue in
    her case had narrowed: the  Tribunal  were  concerned  with  whether  a
    refusal by the Ethiopians to recognise MA as a national would amount to
    persecution.  Whether such a refusal could amount to 'serious harm' was
    a question of refugee law; the matter of whether  they  would  in  fact
    admit her was not. The Court described MA's case as  "highly  unusual",
    and so it was, since the question  of  nationality  was  treated  as  a
    precedent fact which in turn was wholly  determinative  of  the  asylum
    claim.   As Ms Khan submits, this case is  quite  different.   JMA  has
    tangible fears unrelated  to  technical  issues  of  return:  he  fears
    imprisonment, ill-treatment and disproportionate punishment for his act
    of leaving Eritrea without permission, and by extension his failure  to
    report for military service.  The question of his nationality is simply
    a composite part of the test set out at Article 1A(2)  of  the  Refugee
    Convention, to which, globally, the lower standard applies:

         "owing to well-founded fear of  being  persecuted  for  reasons  of
         race, religion, nationality,  membership  of  a  particular  social
         group  or  political  opinion,  is  outside  the  country  of   his
         nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is  unwilling  to
         avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having
         a nationality and being outside the country of his former  habitual
         residence as a result of such events, is unable or, owing  to  such
         fear, is unwilling to return to it"

16. The distinction is well expressed  in  the  Secretary  of  State's  own
    guidance:  Nationality: disputed, unknown and other cases (Version  6.0
    - 2 October 2017). Under the heading 'Burden of Proof' this reads:

         'Unknown  nationality  cases  (previously  described  as  'doubtful
         nationality')

         In unknown nationality cases, the Home Office is not asserting that
         the claimant holds a particular nationality. The  burden  of  proof
         rests with the claimant to show that they  qualify  for  protection
         under the Refugee Convention and the European Convention  on  Human
         Rights, including evidencing their  nationality.  The  standard  of
         proof that the claimant needs to meet is the lower  standard,  they
         just need to show a reasonable degree of likelihood (or real  risk)
         that they will face persecution.'

17. The Court of Appeal has itself underlined the fact-specific  nature  of
    the guidance in MA (Ethiopia).  In RM (Sierra Leone)  [2015]  EWCA  Civ
    541 Lord Justice Underhill stresses that MA was a case  concerned  with
    'returnability'.  He cites Stanley Burnton LJ [at �78 MA]:

         "There was debate before us as to  the  standard  of  proof  to  be
         applied in a case in which a person contends that he is  unable  to
         obtain in this country the passport or  emergency  travel  document
         that is her right as a national of her country  of  origin.  In  my
         judgment, it is not the 'real risk'  test.  The  'real  risk'  test
         applies to the question whether the fear  is  well-founded:  it  is
         well-founded if there is a real risk of persecution. Thus a  person
         who is unwilling to return owing to a fear that is so justified  is
         entitled to refugee status. Inability to return is not qualified in
         the Convention by the words 'owing to such fear',  and  ... I  see
         good reason why it is not. Inability to return can  and  should  be
         proved in the ordinary way, on the balance of probabilities."

18. So too in Abdullah v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2013]
    EWCA Civ 42 where the Court drew a distinction between the question  of
    whether Mr Abdullah would face persecution in Saudi Arabia -  a  matter
    to be determined on the lower standard of proof - and the  question  of
    whether, as a Palestinian, they would let him in at all: that  being  a
    factual question unrelated to the asylum enquiry,  the  ordinary  civil
    standard applied.

19. Having reviewed MA (Ethiopia) and Abdullah the Court of  Appeal  in  RM
    (Sierra Leone) concludes as follows:

         "What emerges from those cases - and would in truth be clear enough
         even in the absence of authority - is that what standard  of  proof
         applies to the question of an applicant's  nationality  depends  on
         the legal issue to which it is  relevant.  If  it  is  relevant  to
         whether he will suffer persecution (whether  by  reference  to  the
         Refugee Convention or article 3), the lesser standard  will  apply.
         But if it is relevant to some other issue - such as whether  it  is
         in fact possible in practice for him to be returned, and any rights
         that may accrue if it is not -  the  standard  is  the  balance  of
         probabilities."

20. For those reasons I am satisfied that there was no error in the  First-
    tier Tribunal applying the lower standard of proof  to  an  issue  that
    here was simply a composite part of the test in Article 1A(2).

21. The Secretary of State's second ground of appeal reads as follows:

         "Additionally, the Fft have seemingly treated the A's  alleged  use
         of  a  Tigrinyan  interpreter   as   virtually   determinative   of
         nationality. This was also a material error".

22. I, and indeed Mr Diwnycz, struggled to identify the error of  law  here
    alleged. The evidence before the Tribunal indicated that a JMA had used
    a Tigrinya interpreter not only for the  preparation  of  a  particular
    medical report, but consistently in GP consultations since 2017.   That
    evidence came from the GP notes and the medical report  itself:  it  is
    difficult to discern what point the author of the grounds seeks to make
    by introducing the word "alleged". Presumably it is not being suggested
    that the doctors were involved in fabricating  evidence.  The  Tribunal
    was in my view perfectly entitled to place  weight  on  that  evidence;
    weight is classically a matter for the Tribunal and Mr Diwnycz did  not
    seek to persuade me that the Tribunal  had  acted  irrationally  in  so
    doing.  As to the submission that the Tribunal treated  the  matter  of
    language as "virtually determinative" I would add that it  is  apparent
    from the passage I have cited at my �8 above that it did not: the  fact
    that JMA could speak Tigrinyan was only one of  the  reasons  that  the
    Tribunal gave for finding JMA to be Eritrean.




    Decisions

23. I find no error of law and the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  is
    upheld.

24. This appeal concerns a claim for protection.  Having had regard to Rule
    14 of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  and  the
    Presidential Guidance Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity Orders  I  therefore
    consider it appropriate to make an order in the following terms:

         "Unless and until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
         Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
         shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his
         family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
         Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
         direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"

                                                           14th January 2020
