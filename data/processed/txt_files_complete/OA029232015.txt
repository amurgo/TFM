For the Appellant:     Mr C Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    No representation


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. We shall refer to the appellant as the entry clearance officer  and  to
    the respondent as the claimant.

 2. Notice of hearing was sent to the address of the claimant's sponsor, Mr
    Abdul Baqi Shirzad, the address of contact provided  by  the  claimant.
    The matter was stood down until the afternoon but there  was  still  no
    appearance.

 3. Pursuant to Rule 38 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008, we consider that it is in the interests  of  justice  to  proceed
    with the hearing.

The decision appealed against

 4. The  entry  clearance  officer  appeals  with  permission  against  the
    decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Griffith, promulgated on  3  June
    2016, allowing the claimant's appeal against the decision of the  entry
    clearance officer to refuse to grant her entry clearance for settlement
    as the spouse of her sponsor, Mr Abdul Baqi Shirzad.

 5. The Judge found that the requirements of Appendix FM of the Immigration
    Rules had not been met. Accordingly, the appeal could  not  be  allowed
    under the Immigration Rules [24].

 6.  He  considered  the  appeal  under  Article  8  of  the  Human  Rights
    Convention. He referred to the approach of the Court of Appeal  as  set
    out in SS (Congo) and Others v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 387. The fact  that
    the case was a "near miss" would not show compelling reasons,  although
    the fact that it was a near miss might be a relevant consideration  'to
    tip the balance in an applicant's favour' [25].

 7. He found that this is a case that can be classified as a "near  miss"in
    that the evidence was deficient to the extent only that  there  was  no
    evidence of payment of the sponsor's August 2014  salary  on  the  bank
    statement. Evidence for the remaining six month  period  was  submitted
    and accepted. The sponsor's evidence that he was paid in cash for  that
    month is supported by the employer and the sponsor  explained  in  oral
    evidence how he spent the money [27].

 8. Judge Griffith referred at [28] to the impact on the public interest as
    discussed in SS (Congo) and Others.  In considering whether there  were
    compelling circumstances in this case, he took into  account  that  the
    sponsor was a former asylum seeker from  Afghanistan  who  has  been  a
    British citizen for ten years.  Further,  the  presenting  officer  was
    'prepared to accept' in the absence of medical evidence the  likelihood
    that the decision to refuse entry clearance to the claimant has  caused
    mental health issues  for  the  sponsor.  His  wife  and  daughter  are
    currently living in Pakistan with his wife's family. The  interests  of
    the child  is  a  factor  to  be  taken  into  account  when  assessing
    proportionality. He stated that '.....it is acknowledged that it is  in
    the best interest of a child to be brought up by both parents' [29].

 9. He had regard at [30] to the public interest considerations  in  s.117B
    of the 2002 Act. No point was taken as to  the  claimant's  ability  to
    meet the  English  language  requirements.  With  regard  to  financial
    independence, he noted that the relevant date is the date of the  entry
    clearance officer's refusal, in January 2015. At that time the  sponsor
    was in employment earning ï¿½19,320.

10. He noted at [31] that the statutory provisions provide that "the public
    interest question, means the question of whether an interference with a
    person's right to respect for private  and  family  life  is  justified
    under  Article  8(2).   He  was  prepared  to  find   that   compelling
    circumstances exist in this case. He considered  that  the  detrimental
    impact on the public interest in this case is small and  is  outweighed
    by the interference that the entry clearance officer's decision has  on
    not only the claimant's  right  to  enjoy  family  life  but  also  the
    interests of the sponsor and the interests of the child and the  family
    [31].  The appeal was  accordingly  allowed  on  human  rights  grounds
    (Article 8).

11. On 7 October 2016, First-tier Tribunal Judge J  M  Holmes  granted  the
    entry clearance officer permission to appeal. It was arguable that  the
    Judge fell into error by treating the appeal as a "near  miss"  despite
    the guidance of the Court of Appeal to the contrary. That  appeared  to
    have coloured the whole approach to the Article 8 appeal.

12. Judge Holmes also noted that the sponsor is not a refugee.  He  appears
    to have the ability to meet the claimant and his daughter  in  Pakistan
    in safety. He offered no reason why he should not be expected  to  live
    with them there if they are unable to  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules. Further, there was no obvious reason in the evidence
    as to why the entry clearance officer should be obliged  to  facilitate
    the family's desire to live in the  UK  as  opposed  to  Pakistan.  The
    Judge's analysis arguably failed to identify such a reason.

Submissions

13. Mr Avery submitted that the problem was that the sponsor had two  jobs.
    No further bank statements  had  been  submitted  to  substantiate  the
    claimed income. The requirements of Appendix FM-SE are mandatory. There
    was no evidence as to whether the sponsor's  2014  salary  payment  was
    reflected in his  bank  statement.  No  further  bank  statements  were
    submitted following this date. It  was  moreover  unclear  whether  the
    sponsor's employment with Emaan had  continued  after  that  date.  The
    sponsor himself stated in evidence that he no longer  works  for  Emaan
    and it is unclear when this employment terminated - [17].

14. He submitted that the Judge "got it wrong" when  seeking  to  apply  SS
    (Congo).  Before embarking on  a  consideration  under  Article  8  the
    claimant would have to show that compelling circumstances existed.  The
    Judge had however noted that the fact that the case was a  "near  miss"
    would not show compelling reasons, albeit that it might be  a  relevant
    consideration to tip  the  balance  in  his  favour  on  the  issue  of
    proportionality [25].

15. Mr Avery noted that the  sponsor  has  not  been  asked  to  return  to
    Pakistan. There were accordingly no  compelling  circumstances  in  the
    case. The claimant currently lives with her  family  and  their  child.
    There was nothing to prevent the sponsor going to Pakistan to live with
    his wife and child.

Assessment

16. Directions were sent by the Tribunal to the sponsor. There has been  no
    Rule 24 response.  No further evidence was sent to the Tribunal.

17. Judge Griffith correctly found that the appeal could not succeed  under
    the Immigration Rules as the sponsor's bank statement  showing  payment
    of his salary into the account to match the salary in  the  wage  slips
    for the relevant six month, period from March to August 2014,  had  not
    been provided.

18. In considering the existence of  compelling  circumstances,  he  stated
    that the presenting officer was prepared to accept the likelihood  that
    the decision to refuse  entry  clearance  has  caused  sponsor  "mental
    health issues" for the sponsor. However, as already noted by the  Judge
    at [29] there was no medical evidence substantiating this. The  sponsor
    had simply stated in evidence that the refusal had made  him  depressed
    and that he could not carry on working.

19. The Judge also had regard to the fact that his wife  and  daughter  are
    living in Pakistan with the wife's family. The  sponsor  was  concerned
    about his daughter's future and for the future of the relationship with
    the claimant in the light of the continuing separation.

20. As noted by the Judge, the fact that an applicant may be  able  to  say
    that  the  case  is  a  "near  miss"  in  relation  to  satisfying  the
    requirements will by no means show that compelling circumstances  exist
    requiring the grant of leave outside the rules. A good deal  more  than
    this would need to be shown to make out such a case.

21. In SS (Congo), supra, the  Court  of  Appeal  held  at  [51]  that  the
    approach to Article 8 in the light  of  the  Rules  in  Appendix  FM-SE
    should be the same as in respect of the substantive leave to enter  and
    leave to remain Rules in Appendix FM. In other words, the same  general
    position applies, that compelling circumstances would have to apply  to
    justify a grant of leave to remain where the  evidence  rules  are  not
    complied with.

22. Lord Justice Richards stated at [53] in SS  (Congo)  that  good  reason
    would need to be shown why a particular applicant was entitled to  more
    preferential treatment with respect to evidence than  other  applicants
    would expect to receive under the Rules. Moreover, in relation  to  the
    proper administration of immigration controls, weight  should  also  be
    given  to  the  secretary  of  state's  assessment  of  the  evidential
    requirements needed to  ensure  prompt  and  fair  application  of  the
    substantive Rules. If an applicant says that they should be given  more
    preferential treatment with respect to evidence than  the  Rules  allow
    for, and for more individualised considerations  of  their  case,  good
    reasons should be put forward to justify that.

23. In justifying his conclusion that there were such reasons entitling him
    to consider Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules,  the  Judge  found
    that this was a near miss case.  He noted that the sponsor was a former
    asylum seeker who has been a British citizen for 10 years. His wife and
    daughter live in Pakistan with her family.  The interests of the  child
    is a factor - [29].

24.  In  considering  whether  the  decision  was  proportionate   in   the
    circumstances, the Judge did not however consider why family life could
    not continue in Pakistan where the claimant and her child live with her
    mother. Nor did he  consider  whether  it  would  be  proportionate  to
    require the claimant to make a further application to be made  to  join
    the sponsor in the UK once the financial requirements under  the  Rules
    are met. Nor did the have due regard to the  proper  administration  of
    immigration control.

25. We accordingly find that the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  erred  in  his
    assessment as to whether good or compelling  reasons  existed  in  this
    case. We find that the decision involved the making of an  error  on  a
    point of law.  We set aside the decision and re-make it on the basis of
    the evidence before the entry clearance officer.

26. We find that the sponsor did not provide the necessary  bank  statement
    that was required to  be  submitted  under  Appendix  FM-SE.   It  also
    remained unclear as to  whether  the  sponsor's  employment  continued,
    especially as he stated that he no longer works for Emaan.

27. The fact that an applicant may be able to say that a case  is  a  "near
    miss" in relation to satisfying the mandatory  requirements,  does  not
    show that compelling circumstances do exist  warranting  the  grant  of
    leave to remain outside the Rules. As noted in SS (Congo, a great  deal
    more than this would need to be shown to make out such a case.

28. The sponsor's wife and daughter are currently living in  Pakistan  with
    the wife's family. There was no evidence as to why  family  life  could
    not continue in Pakistan. We  accept  Mr  Avery's  submission  that  an
    applicant should make an application for  entry  clearance  when  in  a
    position to demonstrate that they meet the relevant requirements  under
    the Rules. Nor could there have  been  a  legitimate  expectation  that
    family life would necessarily be established in the UK.

29. Having considered the evidence as a whole, including the fact that  the
    parties have remained separated for a  lengthy  period,  we  find  that
    there are not any compelling circumstances or reasons given as  to  why
    the claimant is entitled to  more  preferential  treatment  than  other
    claimants to have her case considered outside the Rules.

30.  There  are  moreover  no  insurmountable  obstacles  or   difficulties
    preventing the claimant from making a  further  application  for  entry
    clearance. This might necessitate a further short separation  from  her
    husband  pending  its  outcome.  There  are  no  reasons  or  obstacles
    disclosed by her sponsor that would prevent the continuation  of  their
    relationship, apart from the short period  it  would  take  to  make  a
    proper application for entry clearance.

    Notice of Decision

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    on a point of law. The decision is set aside.  We  substitute  a  fresh
    decision dismissing the claimant's appeal.

    No anonymity direction is made.
