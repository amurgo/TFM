Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr N Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr R Sharma of Counsel instructed by Awan Legal


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Broe promulgated on 17 October 2018 in  which  he  allowed  Mr  Javed's
    appeal against a decision of  the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department dated 17 January 2018 to  refuse  leave  to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom.


2.   Although before me the Secretary of  State  is  the  appellant  and  Mr
    Javed  is  the  respondent,  for  the  sake  of  consistency  with  the
    proceedings before the First-tier Tribunal I shall hereafter  refer  to
    the Secretary of State as the Respondent and Mr Javed as the Appellant.




3.   The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 27  November  1979.   He
    entered the United Kingdom on 24 July 2007 as a student with  leave  to
    enter valid until 30 November 2008.  On 15 November  2008  he  made  an
    application for leave to remain as a  Tier  1  Highly  Skilled  migrant
    which was successful, leave being granted until 8  July  2011.   On  11
    March 2011 the Appellant applied for further leave to remain as a  Tier
    1 (General) Migrant, which was granted until 19 May  2013.   A  further
    application in the same capacity was made on 22 April 2013 and  granted
    until 14 May 2016.  On 14 May 2016 the Appellant  made  an  application
    for indefinite leave to remain as a Tier  1  (General)  Migrant.   This
    application was varied for leave to remain under  the  family  /private
    life route on 9 March 2017, and again varied for  indefinite  leave  to
    remain on the basis of long residence on 20 July 2017.


4.   The Appellant's application was  refused  for  reasons  set  out  in  a
    'reasons for refusal' letter  ('RFRL')  dated  17  January  2018,  with
    particular reference to paragraphs 276B(ii)(c), 276B(iii) and paragraph
    322(v) of the Immigration Rules.


5.    In  the  course  of  considering  the  Appellant's   application   the
    Respondent obtained details in respect of  his  tax  returns  from  the
    Inland Revenue,  and  considered  the  information  disclosed  by  HMRC
    alongside the details  of  the  Appellant's  earlier  applications  for
    variation of leave to remain.  In particular it was noted that for  the
    tax year 2010/2011 the Appellant had originally declared to the Revenue
    that he had received �9,895 from all employments and �7,845 from  self-
    employment - the total  income  declared  was  �17,850  (including  �75
    interest  received  on  savings).    This  was  in  contrast   to   the
    information provided with the Appellant's application of 11 March 2011,
    in which he had claimed receipts of �33,185  from  self-employment  and
    further receipts from employment making a total  sum  for  earnings  of
    �57,024.88. It may be noted that the tax return for 2010/2011 was filed
    on 23 January 2012.


6.   The Respondent also noted the details of the original  tax  return  for
    the year 2012/2013 in which the Appellant declared �29,570 pay from all
    employments and �398 profit  from  self-employment  -  making  a  total
    declared income of �29,968.  It may be seen that  this  particular  tax
    return was filed on 25 April 2014.  As such, the 2012/2013  tax  return
    was filed  almost  contemporaneously  with  the  application  made  for
    further leave to remain on 22 April 2013.  In  that  application  -  in
    contrast to the information provided to HMRC - the  Appellant  declared
    to the Secretary of State that he had earnings of �56,046.05 between 11
    April 2012 and 10 April 2013: he claimed �26,200  from  self-employment
    and further sums of income from employment with G4S and Carillion.


7.   Necessarily it may  be  seen  that  the  sums  declared  to  HMRC  were
    significantly lower than the sums declared to the Secretary of State.


8.   The RFRL notes that the Appellant  secured  points  under  the  Tier  1
    element of the points-based system in the context  of  his  immigration
    applications by reason of his declared earnings.  Had the earnings been
    declared in a similar  way  to  those  declared  to  the  Revenue,  the
    Appellant would not have scored sufficient points to secure the further
    grants of leave to remain.


9.   The Secretary of State in the RFRL states:

         "It is considered that there would have been  a  clear  benefit  to
         yourself either by failing to declare your full  earnings  to  HMRC
         with  respect  to  reducing  your  tax  liability  or  by   falsely
         representing your earnings to UKVI to enable you to meet the points
         required to obtain leave to remain in the United Kingdom as a  Tier
         1 (General) Migrant."


10.  It is also stated in the RFRL:

         "You provided accountant's letters, prepared accounts and  dividend
         vouchers declaring your income to the Home Office, therefore it  is
         not credible that your accountant would then declare a lower income
         to HMRC, at a later date when completing your tax return.   It  was
         your responsibility to ensure that your tax return was submitted on
         time with correct information  and  by  failing  to  do  so  it  is
         considered that you  have  been  deceitful  or  dishonest  in  your
         dealings with HMRC and/or UKVI."


11.  The Appellant appealed to the IAC.


12.  The appeal was allowed for the reasons  set  out  in  the  Decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Broe promulgated on 17 October 2018.


13.  The Respondent has raised a challenge to that decision, and  permission
    to appeal to the Upper Tier Tribunal was granted by First-tier Tribunal
    Judge Froom on 8 November 2018.


14.  The Appellant has filed  a  Rule  24  response  (also  described  as  a
    Skeleton Argument) dated 18 December 2018 resisting  the  Secretary  of
    State's challenge.


15.  Before the First-tier Tribunal the Appellant sought to explain the  tax
    returns as originally filed as being essentially matters of innocent or
    careless mistake - the blame  resting  with  his  accountants  for  the
    mistake in the first place.  He emphasised that his current accountants
    had sought to rectify matters by correspondence with HMRC commencing in
    December 2015, and that in due course amended returns  had  been  filed
    that were in accordance with the information declared to the  Secretary
    of State in the content of the immigration  applications;  the  Revenue
    had amended the Appellant's tax information accordingly,  and  had  not
    imposed any penalty in this regard.


16.  It was also a feature of the evidence before  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    that the Appellant claimed to be in a relationship with an EEA national
    and to  have  had  a  daughter  through  that  relationship.   A  birth
    certificate was produced at the hearing (see Decision at paragraph 13),
    and the EEA national partner attended to give evidence  in  support  of
    the Appellant's appeal.


17.  It should be noted  that  the  principal  appeal  was  a  human  rights
    appeal. Essentially the Appellant's case was advanced on the basis that
    absent the concerns in relation to the tax issues and the discrepancies
    between the tax returns and the information declared to  the  Secretary
    of State, there would be no  basis  for  the  engagement  of  paragraph
    322(5) of the Immigration Rules,  and  therefore  the  Appellant  would
    qualify  for  indefinite  leave  to  remain   under   paragraph   276B:
    accordingly, if there were no real cause for concern in respect of  the
    tax matters the refusal to grant the Appellant leave to remain  in  the
    UK amounted to a disproportionate interference with the private  and/or
    family life established in the UK.


18.  It is not clear that there was any formal application to seek to  raise
    a new matter in respect of the EEA position - albeit that  the  factual
    circumstance of the Appellant's relationship was raised at the hearing.
     In this context I note that in the  event,  notwithstanding  the  fact
    that evidence was advanced with regard  to  the  relationship  and  the
    birth of a daughter, the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  made  no  specific
    findings of this relationship - and also did not  attempt  to  consider
    the case by reference to the EEA Regulations or otherwise by  reference
    to Treaty rights.


19.  I do observe,  however,  that  there  was  a  discrepancy  between  the
    evidence of the Appellant and the evidence of his purported partner  as
    to the nature of their relationship.  This is apparent from  paragraphs
    16 and 19 of the Decision.  At paragraph 16 the Judge records that  the
    Appellant said "that they live together and there is no-one else living
    in the house, their daughter lives with him".  However, at paragraph 19
    the Judge records the supposed partner as stating "She  and  the  child
    live with her  mother  because  she  needs  support.  Living  with  the
    Appellant was too stressful".


20.   It  is  plain  there  was  a  fundamental  discrepancy  between  those
    testimonies - which  on  any  reading,  without  more,  undermines  the
    Appellant's credibility.

21.  Be that as it  may,  the  focus  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge's
    consideration and Decision was in relation to the issue raised  in  the
    RFRL with regard to the Appellant's tax  affairs  and  declarations  of
    income to the Respondent in the course of earlier applications.


22.  In this context the First-tier Tribunal Judge referred to what  was  at
    that time an unreported judgment that had been brought to his attention
    by the Appellant's representative.  The Judge refers to  this  case  at
    paragraph 22 of his Decision, but misquotes the  reference  number:  it
    should read R v SSHD JR 3097,  not  30397.   This  case  has  now  been
    reported as R (on the application of Khan) v Secretary of State for the
    Home Department (Dishonesty, tax return, paragraph 322(5)) [2018]  UKUT
    00384 (IAC).


23.  The Judge unobjectionably briefly summarised the guiding principles  to
    be derived from Khan (paragraph 23), before addressing the specifics of
    the Appellant's case at paragraphs 24-26 - which contain  the  findings
    and reasons for allowing the appeal:

         "24. There is no dispute that there are discrepancies  between  the
             Appellant's tax returns  for  2010/11  and  2012/13  and  that
             figures given in  his  applications  to  the  Respondent.   He
             provided a letter from the accountants he engaged in  2015  in
             which they confirm his explanation  of  how  the  errors  were
             identified and rectified.  He filed revised returns which were
             accepted by HMRC.  The Appellant provided documentary evidence
             of the revised  calculations  and  the  arrangements  for  the
             outstanding payments to be made.


         25.  I have given careful consideration  to  the  evidence  of  the
             Appellant.  I find it significant that  he  chose  to  address
             these problems in 2015 which was not a time  when  he  had  an
             application for leave to remain on the immediate horizon.   It
             was also before the Respondent's concerns about  such  matters
             became widely known.


         26.   Against  that  background  I  find  the  Appellant's  account
             credible and am not persuaded that he  acted  dishonestly.   I
             find that the Respondent was wrong to refuse  the  application
             under the provisions  of  paragraphs  322(5)  and  276B.   The
             decision is therefore  a  disproportionate  interference  with
             Article 8 rights."


24.  Mr Sharma, in the course of his submissions before  me,  asserted  that
    the Judge had in  substance  identified  three  discernible  bases  for
    concluding that the Appellant's account of an innocent error  -  rather
    than dishonesty - was credible and to be  accepted.   In  short,  those
    three points were: that there had been an error  on  the  part  of  the
    accountant; that the Appellant had attempted  to  rectify  the  problem
    prior to any issue being raised by the Secretary  of  State;  and  that
    HMRC had not imposed a penalty upon the Appellant.


25.  It seems to me that the first of those matters is, on its  own,  of  no
    particular favourable weight or significance. In the abstract, if it is
    established that an accountant has made an error,  this  merely  raises
    the question of whether in signing the erroneous  return  an  applicant
    was merely careless rather than dishonest. The fact of the  error  does
    not inevitably resolve the  issue  of  honesty.  Plainly,  one  of  the
    matters that will need to be taken into account in  evaluating  whether
    the applicant merely innocently endorsed the accountant's error, is the
    nature and extent of the error. I return to this in the context of  the
    instant case below.


26.  I acknowledge that the timing of any rectification  of  errors  in  tax
    returns is a relevant matter  in  evaluating  an  applicant's  honesty.
    However, as Mr Sharma  equally  acknowledged,  it  is  unlikely  to  be
    determinative in and of itself.


27.  Because I have ultimately determined that the decision  in  the  appeal
    must be set aside for the reasons set out below, I do  not  propose  to
    dwell greatly on the particular issue of timing. Moreover, it seems  to
    me that any meritorious criticism of the Judge's approach to the  issue
    of timing is rooted in disagreement rather than identification of error
    of law. Accordingly, I observe no more than that whilst the  evaluation
    of this particular factor was a matter open to the First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge, it appears at the very least generous to say that there  was  no
    application immediately on the horizon in  late  2015  given  that  the
    Appellant's leave  to  remain  was  due  to  expire  on  14  May  2016,
    particularly bearing in mind the time  it  might  take  to  prepare  an
    application.


28.  As regards the absence of a penalty from HMRC, I have  indicated  above
    that it is clearly the case that there was no such penalty.  The  Judge
    also noted as much in rehearsing the Appellant's evidence - "no penalty
    was imposed" (paragraph 15). However, this aspect of the case does  not
    find its way into the Judge's reasoning at paragraphs 24-26.   It  does
    not appear to me on the face of the Decision that the Judge placed  any
    particular reliance favourable to the Appellant upon the absence  of  a
    penalty - notwithstanding Mr Sharma's articulation of  it  as  being  a
    basis for the Judge concluding that the Appellant's claim to have  been
    innocent in respect of errors in his tax returns was credible.


29.  Moreover in this  regard  it  seems  to  me  that  absent  any  further
    information, the mere fact of the absence of a penalty is of  extremely
    limited value. It is to be recalled that these matters were raised  and
    dealt with by HMRC prior to the Appellant's application - and therefore
    prior to the Secretary of State contacting HMRC to seek information  as
    to his tax affairs.  In the circumstance there is no reason to  believe
    that HMRC would have been alerted to the  potential  advantage  to  the
    Appellant in immigration terms in claiming a level of income  different
    from the level declared to HMRC.


30.  From HMRC's 'mono-visual' perspective, it had  a  taxpayer  seeking  to
    make further tax payments on the basis  of  an  unsolicited  unilateral
    declaration that his accountant had previously made an error. Whilst Mr
    Sharma submitted that there was a statutory obligation on HMRC pursuant
    to Schedule 24 of the Finance Act 2007 to consider imposing a  penalty,
    and that HMRC appears to have  exercised  a  choice  not  to  impose  a
    penalty, in my judgement the exact basis upon which any  such  decision
    was made is not apparent on the face of the documents. It seems  to  me
    that it might require something further - for example  by  way  of  the
    Appellant filing his correspondence with the Revenue - before it  could
    be  concluded  that  there  were  no  concerns  about  the  Appellant's
    integrity.


31.  Even if the basis upon which HMRC had determined that  no  penalty  was
    appropriate were established, whilst this would be a  relevant  matter,
    it would not be determinative and would not obviate the duty  upon  the
    Tribunal to make an independent assessment of all of the  circumstances
    as to whether the Appellant had been careless  or  dishonest.  This  is
    particularly so given that the information before the  Respondent,  and
    in turn the Tribunal, was not from the same  'mono-visual'  perspective
    of HMRC: necessarily it also included the evidence of  the  Appellant's
    declarations to the Respondent in support of his earlier  applications,
    which were not obviously matters to which HMRC was privy when  handling
    the Appellant's request to amend his tax returns to pay more tax.


32.  Accordingly, I do not accept Mr  Sharma's  submission  that  the  Judge
    identified  three  bases  in  support  of  his  conclusion  as  to  the
    Appellant's honesty and credibility. It seems to me that the Judge only
    identified two such bases, as set out at paragraphs 24 and  25  of  the
    Decision. In so far as it is suggested that there was a third basis  to
    support such a conclusion, it would have required a  far  more  nuanced
    approach and evaluation than is to be found in the Decision before  any
    particular weight could have been placed upon it. In the  event,  as  I
    have indicated, I do not accept that the Judge did place any particular
    weight on the absence of a penalty from HMRC.


33.  I have noted above that  there  is  scope  for  disagreement  with  the
    substance of the Judge's assessment in respect of timing, but that this
    does  not  constitute  identification  of  an  'error  of  law'.  I  am
    satisfied, however, that error of law is discernible in respect of  the
    Judge's overall consideration of the Appellant's  state  of  mind  when
    making discrepant declarations as to income.


34.  In my judgment the decision of the First-tier Tribunal is deficient  in
    not including any specific focus on the state of mind of the  Appellant
    at  the  time  of  the  submissions  of  his  tax  returns  and/or  his
    applications for leave to remain.  Of course the  subsequent  events  -
    including in particular the voluntary amendments to his tax  returns  -
    may assist in evaluating what his state of mind might have been.


35.  However, the Judge's decision is devoid of analysis  or  evaluation  of
    the  particular  circumstances  in  which  the  Appellant  could   have
    submitted a tax return on  23  January  2012  declaring  an  income  of
    �17,815, having as recently as March 2011 told the Home Office that  he
    was earning �57,877: it was incumbent on  the  Judge  to  consider  and
    determine whether it was plausible that he had declared that sum to the
    Secretary of State and a different sum to the Revenue carelessly rather
    than dishonestly.


36.   Similarly  -  and  perhaps  more  pertinently  bearing  in  mind   the
    contemporaneous nature of the application for leave to remain  and  the
    tax return  -  the  same  exercise  was  required  in  respect  of  the
    circumstance in which the Appellant had submitted to the  Secretary  of
    State on 22 April 2013 that he his earnings were �56,046.05, whereas he
    had declared to the Revenue on 25 April 2013  that  his  earnings  were
    only �29,968.


37.  In the absence of any such analysis  and  evaluation,  the  decision  -
    which in effect was essentially to determine the appeal on the basis of
    the assertion that errors had been made by the  Appellant's  accountant
    which he had later sought to rectify  - was inadequately  reasoned  and
    otherwise failed to engage adequately with the issues.


38.  For completeness I note that Mr Sharma submitted  that  the  Respondent
    had not adequately pleaded the challenge in a way  that  reflected  the
    errors identified above,  and  moreover  had  wrongly  relied  upon  an
    unreported decision in the grounds in support of  the  application  for
    permission to appeal.  It  seems  to  me  that  the  substance  of  the
    challenge that I find is made out is encompassed at paragraph  1(d)  of
    the Secretary of  State's  Grounds  of  Appeal,  which  refers  to  the
    discrepancies between the monies declared varyingly  to  HMRC  and  the
    Respondent and argues "that the appellant cannot possibly  be  ignorant
    of such large discrepancies in the figures provided". I have not  place
    any particular reliance upon  the  unreported  decision  cited  in  the
    Grounds of Appeal, and  indeed  have  not  descended  to  any  sort  of
    analysis of it herein; it does not seem to me that it unduly influenced
    the grant of permission to appeal - and in any event there has been  no
    formal challenge to the grant of permission to appeal.


39.  In all of the circumstances I find that the decision of the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge is inadequately reasoned and is accordingly  to  be  set
    aside for error of law.


40.  The decision in the appeal will require to be remade  with  all  issues
    at large; it is appropriate that this be  done  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal by a Judge other than First-tier Tribunal Judge Broe.

41.  I do not propose to  make  any  specific  directions  in  this  regard:
    standard directions will suffice. It is  a  matter  for  the  Appellant
    (with the assistance of his advisors) if he now wishes to bring forward
    further evidence including - if available  -  any  correspondence  with
    HMRC that might relate to the issue of imposing  (or  not  imposing)  a
    penalty, or any other evidence as to correspondence with either of  his
    accountants or otherwise.


42.  Mr Sharma mentioned the potential EEA ground, and enquired  whether  or
    not it had been treated as a 'new matter',  in  respect  of  which  the
    Respondent would  have  to  give  consent  before  the  Tribunal  could
    exercise any jurisdiction.  Mr Bramble indicated that he was not  aware
    of any formal application in  this  regard,  but  could  not  otherwise
    assist. It seems to me that this is in the  first  instance,  again,  a
    matter for the Appellant (with his advisors) to consider as to  how  to
    take forward; it is not a matter for the Tribunal at the present time.


43.  Finally I make some observations  in  respect  of  the  utilisation  of
    paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules.  I have quoted in the  early
    part of this decision  relevant  passages  from  the  RFRL.   The  RFRL
    appears to identify the problematic conduct of  the  Appellant  in  the
    alternative.  He either misrepresented his circumstances  to  HMRC  for
    financial gain by reducing his liability to tax; or  he  misrepresented
    his circumstances to the Secretary of State to  secure  an  immigration
    advantage.


44.  It seems to me a question arises as to whether paragraph 322(5) can  be
    made out, or supported,  on  alternative  bases  -  or  whether  it  is
    necessary for the Secretary of State (and  in  turn  the  Tribunal)  to
    reach a specific conclusion as to either scenario A or scenario B -  is
    the Secretary of State required 'to nail his colours  to  a  particular
    mast'.  I have only entertained the briefest of  discussions  with  the
    representatives in this regard, and so do not purport  to  resolve  it.
    Rather I merely identify the potential issue  and  the  -  perhaps  not
    fully formulated - observations of the parties.


45.  Mr Sharma suggests that for the sake of certainty, and bearing in  mind
    the burden and standard of proof in this regard, and  the  requirements
    of procedural fairness, the Secretary of State is required to be  clear
    as to a specific allegation.  On the other hand,  Mr  Bramble  suggests
    that if whichever way the matter is looked  at  there  must  have  been
    unsatisfactory conduct one way or the other, then that should be enough
    to engage 322(5).


46.  It may be that  this  will  be  an  issue  with  which  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge will need to engage in remaking the  decision.   However
    Mr Sharma told me that he understood that there is a case to  be  heard
    in the Court of Appeal in which this type of  issue  is  likely  to  be
    explored: it may be that by the time the matter comes back  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal there  will  be  something  by  way  of  definitive
    guidance.  Indeed, in light of any such guidance it  may  be  necessary
    for the Secretary of State to seek to amend the contents of  the  RFRL.
    However, these are matters for the  future,  and  I  make  no  specific
    direction or further observation.


Notice of Decision

47.  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained an error of  law  and
is set aside.


48.  The decision in the appeal  is  to  be  remade  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal by any Judge other than First-tier Tribunal Judge  Broe,  with
    all issues at large.


49.  No anonymity direction is sought or made.
