Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr N Paramjorthy (Mansfield Chambers)
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble (Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a citizen of Sri Lanka  born  in  December  1987.   He
    arrived in this country on 5 October 2007 with  entry  clearance  as  a
    student.  In due course he was granted leave to  remain  as  a  student
    until 27 October 2014.  An application was made on 25 October 2014  for
    leave to remain on the basis of Article 8 (private life).

2.   In his  application  form  he  indicated  he  had  been  granted  entry
    clearance to the United Kingdom as a student, and  he  stated  that  he
    received a monthly income of �500 from his  parents.   The  application
    was refused on 6 January 2015.  The respondent did not find there would
    be any very significant obstacles to  the  appellant's  return  to  Sri
    Lanka and he would not suffer  any  greater  hardship  than  other  Sri
    Lankans there and there were no exceptional circumstances.

3.   The appellant appealed against the decision on  23  January  2015.   It
    was claimed that he was estranged from his family in Sri Lanka  and  he
    had been a victim of child abuse and ill-treated by his family.  He had
    very little to return to in Sri Lanka  when  his  substantial  academic
    achievements in the United Kingdom were taken into account.

4.   The judge noted that the appellant's case  had  developed  since  being
    presented to the  Secretary  of  State  in  October  2014.   There  was
    evidence from the appellant's partner (whom  the  judge  refers  to  as
    "SS") and also evidence of mental  health  difficulties  of  which  the
    respondent had not been previously made aware.  It was  confirmed  that
    the appellant was not relying on family life  with  his  partner.   The
    issue was being raised as part of his private life.   Accordingly  this
    did not amount to a new matter which would have required the consent of
    the  Secretary  of  State  under  Section  85(5)  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  It is to be noted that there  was  no
    Presenting Officer before the First-tier Judge.  It was made clear that
    no reliance was being placed upon paragraph 276ADE(1)  and  accordingly
    the only issue to be decided was whether the appeal should  be  allowed
    by reference to Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules based upon  the
    appellant's private life.  The  judge  heard  oral  evidence  from  the
    appellant about his depression and the abuse he had  suffered  and  his
    symptoms.  He referred to SS whom he had known since October  2010  and
    he wished to propose to her.  His partner would not  accompany  him  to
    Sri Lanka as her family remained in the United Kingdom and she was born
    here.  His partner lived with her parents about one and a  half  hours'
    travel from where the appellant resided.

5.   SS also gave evidence and referred to a previous marriage  between  her
    and an older man which had never been consummated.  The  appellant  had
    confided in her about  the  abuse  he  had  suffered  and  SS  received
    significant support from the appellant whom she wished to marry.   They
    would not live together until their marriage.  They were not engaged.

6.   The First-tier Judge refers  to  the  five  stage  approach  in  Razgar
    [2004] UKHL 27 and concluded that the main  issue  in  the  appeal  was
    proportionality.

7.   The judge went on to make the following findings:

         "57. I accept that the Appellant has been  in  the  United  Kingdom
             since October 2007, and that he has not returned to Sri Lanka.
              I find  that  the  Appellant  has  been  receiving  financial
             support from his parents.  When he made  his  application  for
             further leave to remain  in  October  2014,  he  confirmed  at
             section 5.12  of  the  application  form  that  he  was  still
             receiving �500 per month from his parents.


         58.  It is correct that the nature of this application has  changed
             somewhat, in that initially there  was  no  reference  to  the
             Appellant having a relationship, nor was there  any  reference
             to him having suffered sexual abuse as a child.  The abuse was
             raised for the first time  in  the  Grounds  of  Appeal.   The
             relationship  was  mentioned  for  the  first  time   in   the
             Appellant's witness statement dated 25th May 2016.


         59.  I accept that the Appellant has studied while in this  country
             and that he has been awarded a degree,  and  he  graduated  in
             2014.  I accept that the Appellant has made some friends while
             in this country.  I also accept that he undertook some charity
             work in 2009.  The evidence does not however demonstrate  that
             he has engaged in 'a wealth of charity work' as  contended  in
             the letter accompanying the application for leave to remain.


         60.  Having considered the evidence given by the Appellant and  SS,
             I accept that they are in a relationship.  I accept that SS is
             still married, but that proceedings to annul her marriage have
             been initiated.


         61.  As accepted by the couple, they are not engaged to be married,
             and they do not live together  and  have  never  done  so.   I
             accept that SS lives with her family, and I find  that  it  is
             correct to accept, on the Appellant's behalf, that he  and  SS
             do not have family life that would engage Article 8.


         62.  I accept the contents of the letters from the  wellbeing  team
             of Hertfordshire NHS Trust dated 27th  August  2015  and  21st
             October 2015  to  the  effect  that  the  Appellant  has  been
             attending CBT treatment.  I  accept  that  the  Appellant  has
             disclosed that he  experienced  physical,  sexual  and  mental
             abuse while growing up in Sri Lanka.  I also accept  that  the
             Appellant  has  been  having  counselling  with   Relate,   as
             explained  in  the  letter  dated  21st  June  2016.   I  have
             carefully considered Dr Persaud's report dated 25th  May  2016
             in which the opinion is given that the Appellant suffers  from
             major depression and PTSD.  I am afraid that I do  not  accept
             Dr Persaud's opinion that the Appellant would not  survive  in
             Sri Lanka because of his mental and physical health  problems.
             Dr Persaud gives the opinion that the Appellant is not  liable
             to receive the correct medical  treatment  in  Sri  Lanka  and
             places the Appellant's risk of suicide as moderate to high.  I
             note  that  the  Relate  counsellor,  having  completed  eight
             sessions with the Appellant, as opposed  to  the  one  meeting
             that Dr Persaud undertook, referred to thoughts of  self-harm,
             stated that 'there  does  not  seem  to  be  current  suicidal
             ideation.'  On this  issue,  I  place  more  weight  upon  the
             evidence from Relate, on the basis of the number  of  sessions
             that the counsellor has had with the  Appellant.   Dr  Persaud
             does not provide any basis for his opinion that the  Appellant
             would not receive the correct medical treatment in Sri  Lanka.
             The  Appellant  has  submitted  no  independent  or  objective
             evidence to show that he would not receive the correct medical
             treatment.


         63.  This is not a case  where  it  has  been  contended  that  the
             Appellant would be at risk if returned to Sri Lanka, nor is it
             a case where reliance has been placed upon Article  3  of  the
             1950 Convention.


         64.  The abuse that has caused  the  Appellant  to  seek  help  for
             mental health issues, ended in 2004, and for the avoidance  of
             doubt, I accept the Appellant's account that he  was  sexually
             abused by an aunt.


         65.  I do not accept that the Appellant  suffered  abuse  from  his
             family after 2004.  The evidence  indicates  that  his  family
             financially supported him in Sri Lanka, and  also  financially
             supported him while he has studied in the United Kingdom.


         66.  The Appellant's parents were still providing financial support
             in October 2014, and I do not accept that they  have  stopped
             supporting the Appellant.


         67.  I conclude that the Appellant is currently receiving treatment
             for depression and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder,
             and I do not accept that there is a risk  of  suicide,  and  I
             find that the  Appellant  would  be  able  to  access  medical
             treatment in Sri Lanka.


         68.  I find that the Appellant would be able to obtain support from
             his parents, and because his parents have been supporting  him
             financially, I see no reason why they would not continue to do
             so, and therefore it would not be the case that the  Appellant
             could not  afford  to  pay  for  medical  treatment  that  was
             required."


8.   The judge took into account the considerations set out in Section  117B
    of the 2002 Act and accepted that the appellant could speak English and
    was financially independent, referring to AM (Malawi) [2015] UKUT  0260
    (IAC).  He reminded himself  that  little  weight  could  be  given  to
    private life established by a person at a  time  when  his  immigration
    status was precarious.  He had only ever been granted limited leave  to
    remain.

9.   The judge noted that the appellant  was  aged  28  and  educated  to  a
    degree level and that such a qualification would be  of  assistance  to
    him in obtaining employment in Sri Lanka.  He had come  to  the  United
    Kingdom  to  obtain  a  qualification  on  the  basis   that   such   a
    qualification would enhance his employment prospects.

10.  The judge concluded his determination as follows:

         "74. I see no reason why the Appellant would not be able to  obtain
             employment and accommodation in Sri Lanka and  obtain  medical
             treatment that he requires.


         75.  If the Appellant wishes to work in the United Kingdom,  it  is
             open to him to make  the  appropriate  application  for  entry
             clearance from Sri Lanka.  If the Appellant and SS decide that
             they wish to marry, then again it is open to the Appellant  to
             make the appropriate entry clearance from Sri Lanka.


         76.  I find that the weight that must be attached to the fact  that
             the Appellant cannot satisfy the Immigration  Rules,  and  the
             weight to be given  to  the  public  interest  in  maintaining
             effective immigration control,  outweighs  the  weight  to  be
             attached to the wishes of the Appellant that he be allowed  to
             remain in the United Kingdom notwithstanding  that  he  cannot
             satisfy the Immigration Rules."

11.  Accordingly, the judge dismissed the appeal.

12.  Permission to appeal was sought on a number of grounds.

13.  The  application  came  before  First-tier  Judge  Pullig.   The  judge
    considered that the application was out of time but extended  time.   I
    will need to return to this issue for reasons given below.

14.  Judge Pullig rejected the majority of the grounds but  considered  that
    it was arguable that the  judge  had  erred  in  paragraph  62  of  his
    determination in not accepting the  opinion  of  Dr  Persaud  that  the
    appellant would not survive in Sri Lanka  because  of  his  mental  and
    physical health problems.  Reference in paragraph 4 of the grounds  had
    been made to paragraphs 451-456  of  GJ  and  Others  (post-civil  war:
    returnees) Sri Lanka CG [2013] UKUT 00319 (IAC).

15.  In relation to paragraph 6 of the grounds  which  raised  a  number  of
    issues relating to proportionality, Judge Pullig notes that some of the
    items repeated matters complained of earlier in the  grounds  which  he
    had already dealt with and  granted  permission  only  insofar  as  the
    arguments related to  the  appellant's  medical  condition.   In  other
    respects the judge's findings were sustainable and where there were  no
    findings the matters complained of were peripheral and not material.

16.  As I have already mentioned at the hearing an issue was taken with  the
    finding by Judge Pullig that the grounds were  out  of  time.   Counsel
    filed a bundle containing the relevant e-mail correspondence.   Counsel
    drew attention to the fact that it  was  stated  on  the  face  of  the
    determination that it had  been  promulgated  on  27  July  2016  which
    differed from the date on the cover sheet - 26 July  2016.   The  cover
    sheet was stamped with the date Counsel had received the  determination
    - 28 July 2016.  Counsel had sent an application initially on 9  August
    2016 unhappily including the wrong determination.   However,  this  was
    speedily corrected the following  day  and  the  Tribunal  acknowledged
    receipt on Wednesday, 10 August 2016 at  10.50  a.m.   Accordingly,  he
    submitted the application was in time.  However, the appellant had been
    told in December 2016 when reporting that the  decision  had  not  been
    appealed from.   Counsel  accordingly  resubmitted  all  the  chain  of
    correspondence, again submitting the application was not in time but in
    the alternative requesting time to be extended.  The  First-tier  Judge
    had not dealt with the issue of the  initial  application  having  been
    lodged in time but had simply extended time.

17.  Mr Bramble accepted that if  what  was  stated  was  correct  then  the
    application was lodged in time, although he could not of  course  speak
    for what had gone on in the Tribunal offices.

18.  The issue is not directly in front of me and it is not relevant to  the
    disposal of this case.  Anything I say  would  not  bind  the  parties.
    However, from the file it does appear  that  the  promulgation  of  the
    decision was indeed issued on 27 July 2016 and not 26 July  2016.   The
    file copy of the promulgation  notice  bears  the  27  July  date.   As
    Counsel points out, that is consistent with the date given on the  face
    of the determination.

19.  As I have said, Mr Bramble  accepted  that  if  the  grounds  had  been
    lodged on the date claimed and the determination had  been  promulgated
    when claimed they would be in time.  However, he could not  comment  on
    what had gone on before the Tribunal.  I do not  think  that  there  is
    much I could or should add on the matter, although I can  say  that  it
    would appear that the promulgation date was the 27th  rather  than  the
    26th.  There is little I can say about e-mail  correspondence  that  is
    not in the Tribunal file.  Counsel does not appear as a witness  before
    me in this matter.  All I can say in an effort to be helpful is that it
    would not be the first occasion in which material  has  not  reached  a
    Tribunal file.

20.  The reason why Counsel wishes to have the matter looked at is  that  it
    is proposed to make an application  under  the  ten  year  Rule  and  a
    delayed application for permission would stop the clock running.   That
    of course is not a matter for me at this hearing.

21.  The principal point relates to the medical  evidence  and  the  judge's
    treatment of it in  paragraph  62  of  the  decision.   Mr  Paramjorthy
    submitted there was a tension in the evidence in  that  the  judge  had
    accepted that the appellant had been abused.  He acknowledged that  the
    grounds had been restricted.  Mr Bramble submitted that the  judge  had
    taken into  account  all  the  evidence.   Paragraph  62  was  the  key
    paragraph.  For the reasons given the judge had been entitled to prefer
    the report made by Relate on the specific issue.  He had only seen  the
    appellant on one occasion.  He was entitled to conclude that Dr Persaud
    had not explained why the  appellant  would  not  receive  the  correct
    medical treatment in Sri Lanka.

22.  There was no reply from Mr Paramjorthy.

23.  The First-tier Judge gave careful consideration  to  all  the  material
    before him.  He notes in paragraph 49 that he had  taken  into  account
    all the documentation received.  He states and  I  have  no  reason  to
    doubt that he had given careful consideration to  Dr  Persaud's  report
    and he properly explains  why  he  parted  company  with  it.   He  was
    entitled to prefer the material provided by the Relate  counsellor  who
    had completed eight sessions with  the  appellant  and  concluded  that
    there did not seem to be current suicidal ideation.  The judge makes it
    plain that he had placed more weight upon the evidence from  Relate  on
    this issue.  It is not apparent  he  was  not  aware  of  Dr  Persaud's
    qualifications.  It was open to the judge to place more  reliance  upon
    Relate's evidence on this particular matter.

24.  Reference was made in the appellant's grounds to GJ and  in  particular
    paragraphs 452 to 456.  In that case it had been accepted the appellant
    had a genuine fear of return and had suicidal ideation and  firm  plans
    to commit suicide rather than return.  In paragraph 456 it was accepted
    that the appellant was mentally very ill and too ill to  give  reliable
    evidence.

25.  In this case the  judge  concluded  that  the  appellant  could  obtain
    support from his parents and he would be able  to  afford  to  pay  for
    medical treatment that was required.  I am not satisfied that when  the
    decision is read as a whole the judge materially erred in concluding as
    he did.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.


TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

The First-tier Judge made no fee award and I make none.
