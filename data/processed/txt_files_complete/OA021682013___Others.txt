For the Appellant:           Mr Brown, Counsel instructed by Silverdale
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                             DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellants are all nationals of Pakistan. They are  respectively  a
    mother and  her  two  children.  They  appeal  with  permission[1]  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Edwards)  to  dismiss  their
    linked appeals against decisions to refuse them entry clearance for the
    purpose of settlement. The First Appellant sought, under paragraph  281
    of the 'old' Immigration Rules, entry as the wife of Mr  Israr  Hussain
    Shah, a person present and settled in the United  Kingdom.  The  Second
    and Third Appellants made their applications under paragraph 297 as his
    children.


 2. The applications had all been refused on the grounds that a) the  Entry
    Clearance Officer (ECO) had not accepted that the relationship  between
    the First Appellant and Mr Shah was genuine and subsisting, b) they had
    failed to demonstrate that they would be adequately maintained  without
    recourse to public funds and c) they would be adequately accommodated.

 3. When the matter came before the First-tier Tribunal it found  there  to
    be "ample evidence" that this was a  marriage  of  some  sixteen  years
    standing and that there was no reason to doubt the  intentions  of  the
    parties. There has  been  no  challenge  to  that  finding  and  it  is
    preserved.

 4. In respect of maintenance and accommodation the Tribunal heard evidence
    from a Dr Nasreen Sikander. She is the First Appellant's aunt. She gave
    evidence to the effect that the family would be living  rent-free  with
    her in her four bedroomed house and that she would in addition  provide
    them with �500 per month by way of financial support until they were in
    a position to support themselves. This third-party support was  offered
    to supplement the earnings, from paid  and  self-  employment,  of  the
    sponsor Mr Shah.

 5. The parties were in agreement that the task  of  the  Tribunal  was  to
    determine whether the parties would be maintained "adequately" and this
    was to be assessed in light of  the  "income  support  comparator",  as
    approved in KA and Others (Adequacy  of  maintenance)  Pakistan  [2006]
    UKAIT 00065.  The agreed figure was that the family needed  to  show  a
    total income of �258.83 per  week,  or  �1121.60  per  month.   It  was
    accepted that Mr Shah earned �210 net per week from his  employment  at
    Tesco.  It was not accepted that any weight could be  attached  to  his
    claimed earnings from self-employment. A letter from his accountant was
    found to be  "extraordinary"  since  it  failed  to  mention  something
    disclosed in his own evidence, namely that his business had  been  part
    owned by someone else who had a 25% stake.  In respect of Dr Sikander's
    evidence the Tribunal simply states:

         "What she is offering is not only �500 per month, equating to  �115
         per week, but rent and tax free  accommodation  indefinitely.  Such
         support is only intended to be transitional, and I am not  prepared
         to accept that such an open ended arrangement that she proposes  is
         realistic"

    Considering all of  these  sources  of  income  the  Tribunal  was  not
    satisfied that the parties would be adequately maintained.


 6.  The  determination  concludes  by  addressing  accommodation  in   the
    following terms: "Although there is no up to  date  inspection  report,
    the original one, while  not  completely  satisfactory,  does  show  Dr
    Sikander's premises are commodious. However, it does appear that at the
    date of decision, the appellants could not satisfy the requirements  as
    to accommodation". The  appeal  was  dismissed  under  the  Rules,  and
    Article 8.


 7. Permission to  appeal  was  sought,  and  granted,   on  the  following
    grounds:

        i) In describing the letter from the accountant as  "extraordinary"
           the Tribunal has failed to give any reasons for that conclusion,
           or adequately explain why the contents could not be relied upon;


       ii) The approach taken to third  party  support  was  wrong  in  two
           material respects. The  First-tier  Tribunal  erred  in  law  in
           stating that such support could only be "transitional" (ie short
           term). Reliance is placed on Mahad [AM (Ethiopia)] v ECO  [2009]
           UKSC 16. Further there was  no  reasons  given  as  to  why  the
           evidence of Dr Sikander could not be accepted.

      iii) In respect  of  accommodation  the  reasoning  in  unclear;  the
           Tribunal accept that the property was "commodious" but dismissed
           the appeal on this ground nevertheless.




    Error of Law


 8. I am satisfied that the First-tier Tribunal erred in  its  approach  to
    the third-party support offered  by  Dr  Sikander.  She  is  the  First
    Appellant's aunt. She is close to her niece and has given  unchallenged
    evidence that she fully supports her in her decision to move to the UK.
    In support  of  the  applications  she  provided  a  sworn  sponsorship
    undertaking, provided copies of her bank statements and confirmed  that
    she would be willing to support them for as long as it takes  for  them
    to be self sufficient. She is a practising semi-retired  GP  who  earns
    approximately �60,000 per annum, combined income from her  NHS  pension
    (�24,000) and continued earnings (�36,000). She has no dependents,  her
    only son being an adult with his own job.   He lives with  her  in  her
    large mortgage-free  home. In  her  oral  evidence  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal she confirmed  that  she  was  able  and  willing  to  provide
    accommodation, plus �500 per month in  supplementary  income.     There
    has never been any dispute that Dr Sikander had, and continues to  have
    the means to provide this support.   She has consistently  stated  that
    she wishes to provide it, and has, in her unchallenged oral evidence to
    the First-tier Tribunal, confirmed that the sum she  had  in  mind  was
    �500.   All of this is compliant with Mahad. I find that the First-tier
    Tribunal erred in failing to give reasons why  Dr  Sikander's  evidence
    should be rejected. I am further satisfied that there  was  a  material
    misdirection in law. If by "transitional" the First-tier Tribunal meant
    "short term", this is not the test in Mahad, in which the Supreme Court
    expressly accepted that the Rule could be met with  recourse  to  long-
    term third party support.   It is difficult to see on  what  basis  the
    First-tier   Tribunal   found   this   proposed   arrangement   to   be
    "unrealistic".    Mr McVeety confirmed that  he  had  no  challenge  Dr
    Sikander's credibility as a witness. As Mr  Brown  pointed  out,  as  a
    practising doctor she was a professional of standing and  her  evidence
    was capable of attracting significant weight. I find  that  the  First-
    tier Tribunal did err in law  and  that  the  decision  in  respect  of
    maintenance must be set aside. On  a  balance  of  probabilities  I  am
    satisfied that the maintenance requirement of the Rule was met  at  the
    date of decision.


 9. It follows that I do not need to address  the  approach  taken  to  the
    Sponsor's earnings from self-employment.


10. The reasoning in respect of accommodation is unclear to the extent that
    the Appellants are unable to understand why they have lost.  Indeed  Mr
    McVeety  acknowledged  that  he  was  unable  to  understand  why   the
    Respondent had won.   The  decision  in  respect  of  accommodation  is
    therefore set aside.  The evidence in the property  inspection  report,
    submitted with the application and apparently accepted  by  the  First-
    tier Tribunal, was that Dr Sikander's home has four bedrooms, a  dining
    room and a living room. There was  further  evidence  produced  at  the
    First-tier Tribunal hearing that the basement  had  been  converted  to
    include a gym, although for present purposes that can  be  disregarded.
    At the date of decision she was living there with her adult  son,  each
    of them occupying a bedroom.  The ECO, noting this, found the remaining
    two bedrooms were not suitable accommodation for this family, since the
    "housing act" prohibits children over 12 sharing a room with a child of
    a different gender. The Second Appellant was at the date of decision an
    eight-year old boy, the Third Appellant a twelve-year old girl.  I  was
    provided with the relevant part of the Housing Act  1985.  Section  325
    reads as follows:


         325 The room standard


      1) The room standard is contravened when the number of persons
         sleeping in a dwelling and the number of rooms available as
         sleeping accommodation is such that two persons of opposite sexes
         who are not living together as husband and wife must sleep in the
         same room.


      2) For this purpose-


              (a)      children under the age of ten shall be left out of
                      account, and
              (b)      a room is available as sleeping accommodation if it
                      is of a type normally used in the locality either as
                      a bedroom or as a living room.


11. It will be apparent from this that the ECO was  wrong  on  two  counts.
    First of  all  the  house  will  not  be  overcrowded  where  there  is
    additional sleeping accommodation in  a  room  "normally  used  in  the
    locality as a living room". The living room could therefore be counted.
    Secondly the Appellant under the age of  ten  should  be  left  out  of
    account. There is really no sensible  construction  of  this  provision
    that could lead to the conclusion that a four bedroomed  house  with  a
    dining room, living room and gymnasium would be overcrowded if occupied
    by six people.  I am satisfied that there was adequate accommodation.



    Decisions


12. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains an error of law and it
    is set aside.


13. I re-make the decision in  the  appeals  by  allowing  them  under  the
    Immigration Rules.

14. I make no direction for anonymity because neither party  has  requested
    one and on the facts I do not consider such an order to be necessary.
