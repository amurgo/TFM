Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Hunt-Jackson, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:        Mr B Clark, Barry Clark Solicitors

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. In this appeal the Appellant is the Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
    Department and the Respondent is Mrs Jaspreet Kaur a citizen  of  India
    born 18th July 1989. For ease of reference however I shall refer to the
    Secretary of State as "the Respondent" and Mrs Kaur as "the Appellant".



 2. This is the review of an appeal brought  against  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer New Delhi, to refuse  the  Appellant  entry  clearance  to  the
    United Kingdom as a spouse to join her husband "the Sponsor" who  is  a
    British citizen settled here.

History of the Matter

 3. The Appellant made application on 7th August 2012 to join  her  husband
    as his spouse. It is accepted that she  and  her  husband  are  validly
    married and at the date of decision which is 1st November  2012,  there
    were no dependant children born of the union.

 4. The ECO refused the application because he was not satisfied  that  the
    Appellant  met  the   requirements   of   Appendix   FM-SE   (Financial
    Requirements) of the new  Immigration  Rules.  In  order  to  meet  the
    financial requirements the Appellant needed to show  that  her  Sponsor
    had a gross income of �18,600 per annum and that he had been in receipt
    of this amount for at least six months.

 5. The ECO was satisfied that the Sponsor was holding down two jobs  which
    brought in a  gross  income  of  at  least  �18,600;  but  he  had  not
    demonstrated that this had  been  the  situation  for  six  months.  He
    therefore refused the Appellant's application.

 6. The Appellant appealed the refusal and the appeal  came  before  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Reed. At  the  hearing  before  the  Judge  it  was
    accepted on behalf of the  Appellant,  that  she  could  not  meet  the
    Immigration Rules. It was claimed  however  that  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer's refusal was disproportionate under Article 8 ECHR.

 7. In his determination the First-tier Tribunal Judge concluded,

         "The evidence before me  demonstrates  that  at  the  time  of  the
         application and the decision, the Sponsor was earning a  sum  which
         was in excess of �19,000 per  annum.  I  therefore  find  that  the
         Appellant has demonstrated that although she did not  meet  all  of
         the documentary requirements of Appendix FM, her  husband's  income
         was such that she in effect met  the  substance  of  the  financial
         requirements. I say this because I am satisfied on the  balance  of
         probabilities that the Sponsor was earning  at  least  �18,600  per
         annum".

     The Judge then summed up at paragraph 33,

         "The Respondent's decision prevents family life from continuing  in
         the  country  of  the  Sponsor's  nationality  and   in   all   the
         circumstances cannot be considered to be proportionate. I therefore
         allow the appeal under Article 8 of the ECHR".

 8. The Respondent sought and was granted permission to  appeal.  Thus  the
    matter comes before me to determine firstly whether there is  an  error
    contained in the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge's  judgment;  and  if  so
    whether it is of sufficient gravity such as to require the decision  to
    be remade.



The Hearing Before Me

 9. I heard representations from both parties. Mr Hunt-Jackson on behalf of
    the Respondent sought to rely on the grounds  seeking  permission.  The
    Appellant had failed to meet the Immigration Rules and  the  Judge  had
    erred in his assessment under Article  8,  as  he  had  not  given  the
    appropriate weight to the Respondent's clear expression of  the  public
    interest element. The Judge had failed to balance the  public  interest
    appropriately. In any event the Article 8 assessment itself  was  given
    without adequate reasoning.

10. Finally Mr Hunt-Jackson submitted, the Judge had  failed  to  recognise
    that there is no near-miss  principle  applicable  to  the  Immigration
    Rules. Miah [2012] EWCA Civ 261.

11. Mr Clark on behalf of the Appellant submitted  that  the  determination
    should stand.  The  Judge  found  clearly  at  paragraph  30  that  the
    substance of the Rules were met and was therefore  satisfied  that  the
    decision of the Respondent was disproportionate. The  Judge  had  found
    that the decision interfered with the Appellant  and  Sponsor's  family
    life. The decision was therefore sustainable.

12. At the end of submissions, both representatives  agreed  there  was  no
    challenge to facts found by the First-tier Tribunal Judge and if I were
    to find the decision disclosed an error of law then I could go  on  and
    remake the decision.

Has the Judge Erred

13. I am satisfied that the First-tier Tribunal Judge erred in the decision
    he made and that the decision needs to  be  remade  for  the  following
    reasons.

14. Firstly in paragraph 30 of the determination the Judge records that  he
    finds  that  although  the  Appellant  did  not  meet  the  documentary
    requirements of Appendix FM, she in effect met  the  substance  of  the
    financial requirements. That in my judgment is the wrong  approach  and
    it is this which has led the  Judge  into  error.  As  Mr  Hunt-Jackson
    points out there is  no  near-miss  principle  when  dealing  with  the
    Immigration  Rules.  The  Rules  have  been  framed  and  endorsed   by
    Parliament to  take  into  account  public  policy  consideration  when
    weighed against individual family and private rights.

15. At the date of decision which is the relevant one in an out of  country
    case  (even  for  Article  8),  the  Appellant  could  not   meet   the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules. What  the  Judge  needs  to  ask
    himself is where then is the  disproportionate  interference  with  the
    Appellant and Sponsor's family life.

16. The Judge found that the Appellant  and  his  wife  have  a  subsisting
    marriage and intend to live together permanently.  I  agree  with  that
    finding, and am satisfied that there was evidence of family life at the
    date of the decision.

17. The next consideration which the Judge properly identified  is  whether
    at  the  date  of  decision  on  the  balance  of  probabilities,   the
    Respondent's decision would have consequences of  such  gravity  as  to
    potentially engage the operation of Article 8. The Judge  found  and  I
    accept that it is more likely than not that the Sponsor  would  not  be
    able to live permanently with the Appellant in  India.  Accordingly  if
    the decision is maintained, the probability is that they would  not  be
    able to enjoy their family life with each other  by  living  physically
    together. This therefore engages the operation of Article 8.

18. I turn however to the main  issue  in  this  appeal  which  is  one  of
    proportionality. In this I take guidance from  Huang  and  Razgar.  The
    guidance in those cases is to the effect that "decisions taken pursuant
    to the lawful operation of immigration control will be proportionate in
    all save a small minority of exceptional cases, identifiable only on  a
    case by case basis". Judges  when  assessing  proportionality  must  be
    careful to state clearly that their task is to weigh all the  competing
    considerations  and  give  due   and   considerable   weight   to   the
    considerations in favour of the decision appealed against. They  should
    then answer the proportionality question by stating whether  they  find
    that the case they are dealing with, although it is not covered by  the
    Rules, is entitled to succeed under Article 8. The expectation  remains
    that such cases will form a very small minority. Turning to the present
    case, there is nothing in the evidence before the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge, nor me, to show that the situation  of  this  Appellant  can  be
    described as one of those "very small minority of cases". In fact there
    is little evidence at all to weigh in the  Appellant's  favour  in  the
    Article 8 assessment, other than to say she and the Appellant  enjoy  a
    subsisting relationship, which by choice, they would like  to  continue
    in the UK. That is hardly exceptional.

19. For the foregoing reasons, the First-tier Tribunal Judge erred in  law.
    I remake the decision. The Appellant's appeal against the  Respondent's
    decision to refuse her entry clearance is dismissed.

20. I will add one post-script to this decision.  I  was  informed  at  the
    hearing, by Mr Clark, that the Sponsor has now worked for six months in
    the same employment. Mr Hunt-Jackson  accepted  this.  Mr  Hunt-Jackson
    said that the appropriate course of action would be for  the  Appellant
    to make a fresh application. I canvassed this with Mr Clark. He gave  a
    pessimistic response. I do not share his pessimism.  If  the  Appellant
    can now meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules,  which  by  all
    accounts she can, then this is not a case without hope of a  successful
    conclusion. However so far as disposal of this appeal is concerned, the
    appeal is dismissed.
