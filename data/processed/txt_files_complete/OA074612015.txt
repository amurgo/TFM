                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Although this is an appeal by the Entry Clearance Officer  I  refer  to
    the parties as they were before the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The Appellant, a  citizen  of  Pakistan,  appealed  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal against the decision of  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  (ECO)
    dated 7th April 2015 to refuse her application for entry clearance as a
    partner  under  Appendix  FM  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Steer dismissed the appeal under the  Immigration  Rules
    but allowed the appeal under  Article  8  outside  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.  The Secretary of State now appeals, with  permission,  to  this
    Tribunal.

 3. The background to this appeal is that the  Appellant  applied  on  25th
    January 2015 for settlement under Appendix FM of the Rules.  The  Entry
    Clearance Officer refused that decision in a decision dated  7th  April
    2015 on the basis that the documents submitted did not contain all  the
    information required under Appendix FM in that there  was  no  original
    letter from the Sponsor's employer containing all  of  the  information
    required.  In addition, the Appellant had failed to submit the required
    bank statements for the six month period  prior  to  the  date  of  the
    application showing  the  Sponsor's  salary  deposited  into  the  bank
    accounts.  The  application  was  refused  in  light  of  the  lack  of
    specified evidence on the basis of which the ECO concluded that he  was
    not satisfied that the Sponsor was employed and paid as stated and that
    his total income for the previous six months met the income threshold.

 4. The judge noted [13] that  it  had  been  conceded  on  behalf  of  the
    Appellant that that the appeal could not succeed under the  Immigration
    Rules given the  failure  by  the  Sponsor  to  provide  the  specified
    documents with the application.  It was submitted to the judge that the
    further documents provided by the Sponsor  corroborated  his  claim  to
    have met the income threshold at the date of the  application  and  the
    evidence provided demonstrated that the Sponsor remained able  to  meet
    the income threshold.  The judge decided at [15]:

         "It is correct that the Immigration Rules do not  provide  for  the
         consideration of documents other than those specified, to  evidence
         that an Appellant can meet the income threshold and that is a 'gap'
         between the Immigration Rules and Article 8.  For  this  reason,  I
         will consider Article 8 directly."

 5. Ms Fijiwala submitted that in deciding to go on to consider  Article  8
    in the circumstances the judge made an error of law.  She relied on the
    decision in SS (Congo) and Others [2015] EWCA Civ 387.  She  relied  on
    paragraphs 50 to 53 and submitted that the  judge  had  not  identified
    compelling circumstances to justify a grant of leave to enter where the
    evidential rules have not been complied with.  She submitted  that  the
    judge's assertion that the gap between the  Rules  and  Article  8  was
    sufficient to go on to consider Article 8 was not enough.

 6. Mr Plowright submitted that  sufficient  compelling  circumstances  had
    been identified.  It was clear from the evidence before the judge  that
    the income threshold had been met.  He relied on the submission made by
    the Presenting Officer at the hearing accepting that evidence had  been
    submitted to corroborate the Appellant's claimed income from employment
    [8].  He further submitted that a further factor  was  the  significant
    delay in the case as the couple were married in 2011,  the  application
    was made in January 2015, the refusal decision was made in  April  2015
    and the hearing did not occur until May 2016. He submitted there was an
    inference that the delay was a factor before the judge and  that  there
    were compelling circumstances in this case.

 7. I have taken into account the guidance given by the Court of Appeal  in
    SS  (Congo)  in  relation  to  the  evidential  requirements   of   the
    Immigration Rules in entry clearance appeals where Richards LJ said:

         "51. In our judgment, the approach to Article 8 in the light of the
         Rules in Appendix FM-SE should be the same as  in  respect  of  the
         substantive LTE and LTR Rules in Appendix FM. In other  words,  the
         same general position applies, that compelling circumstances  would
         have to apply to justify a grant of LTE or LTR where  the  evidence
         Rules are not complied with.

         52.  This is for two principal reasons. First, the  evidence  rules
         have the same general objective as the substantive rules, namely to
         limit the risk that someone is admitted into the United Kingdom and
         then becomes a burden on public resources,  and  the  Secretary  of
         State has the same primary function in relation to them, to  assess
         the risk and put in place measures which  are  judged  suitable  to
         contain it within acceptable bounds. Similar weight should be given
         to her assessment of what the  public  interest  requires  in  both
         contexts.

         53.  Secondly, enforcement  of  the  evidence  rules  ensures  that
         everyone applying for LTE or LTR is treated equally and  fairly  in
         relation to the evidential requirements they must satisfy. As  well
         as keeping the costs of administration  within  reasonable  bounds,
         application of standard rules is an important means  of  minimising
         the risk of arbitrary differences in  treatment  of  cases  arising
         across the wide range of  officials,  tribunals  and  courts  which
         administer the system of immigration controls. In this regard,  the
         evidence Rules (like the substantive Rules) serve as a safeguard in
         relation to rights of applicants and family members  under  Article
         14 to equal treatment within the scope of  Article  8:  compare AJ
         (Angola), above, at [40], and Huang, above, at [16] ("There  will,
         in almost any case, be certain general considerations  to  bear  in
         mind: the general administrative  desirability  of  applying  known
         rules if a  system  of  immigration  control  is  to  be  workable,
         predictable, consistent and  fair  as  between  one  applicant  and
         another; the damage to good administration and effective control if
         a system is perceived by applicants internationally  to  be  unduly
         porous, unpredictable or perfunctory; ... the  need  to  discourage
         fraud, deception and deliberate breaches of  the  law;  and  so  on
         ..."). Good  reason  would  need  to  be  shown  why  a  particular
         applicant was entitled to more preferential treatment with  respect
         to evidence than other applicants would expect to receive under the
         Rules. Moreover,  in  relation  to  the  proper  administration  of
         immigration controls, weight should also be given to the  Secretary
         of State's assessment of  the  evidential  requirements  needed  to
         ensure prompt  and  fair  application  of  the  substantive  Rules:
         compare Stec v United Kingdom, cited at para. [15] above. Again, if
         an applicant says that  they  should  be  given  more  preferential
         treatment with respect to evidence than the Rules  allow  for,  and
         more individualised consideration of their case, good reason should
         be put forward to justify that."

 8. The reason given by the First-tier Tribunal Judge at paragraph  15  for
    going on to consider the Appellant's  appeal  outside  the  Immigration
    Rules was that there is no provision in the Immigration Rules  for  the
    consideration of documents other than those specified and that this  is
    a 'gap' between the  Immigration  Rules  and  Article  8.  However  the
    evidential requirements apply to all applicants and the judge failed to
    identify  any  reason  why  this  Appellant  would   be   entitled   to
    preferential treatment with respect to the evidence required than other
    applicants. There is nothing in the decision to support Mr  Plowright's
    submission that there is an inference  that  the  delay  in  this  case
    amounted to compelling circumstances in the judge's mind.  In my  view,
    the judge failed to  identify  appropriately  compelling  circumstances
    before going on to consider Article 8.

 9. Ms Fijiwala further submitted that, when she  did  go  on  to  consider
    Article 8, the  judge  had  failed  to  properly  consider  the  public
    interest in assessing proportionality.  She submitted  that  the  judge
    had failed to follow the guidance in Agyarko and Others [2015] EWCA Civ
    440 and Rhuppiah [2016] EWCA Civ 803.  She submitted that the judge had
    failed to follow the  guidance  in  Agyarko  that  the  "insurmountable
    obstacles" requirement set out  in  the  Rules  should  be  taken  into
    account in considering Article  8  outside  the  Rules.   Mr  Plowright
    submitted that the judge had taken into  account  Section  117  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  and  that  the  issue  of
    proportionality was open to the judge on  the  basis  of  the  evidence
    before her.

10. I accept that the judge did consider Section 117 of the 2002 Act.   The
    judge also considered the guidance in the case of Mustafa and said that
    it is right to ask if the Appellant satisfied the requirements  of  the
    Rules in terms of illuminating the balancing exercise.  The  judge  did
    weigh in the Appellant's favour the fact that  the  income  requirement
    had been met in terms of the substantive  Rules  at  the  date  of  the
    application and up to the date of the hearing.  Whilst  the  judge  did
    take into account that one of the evidential requirements of the  Rules
    had not been satisfied it is not clear from the assessment at paragraph
    26 why this factor did not outweigh the positive factors  in  paragraph
    25.  In any event, I  accept  that  the  judge  did  not  consider  the
    guidance in Agyarko in relation to insurmountable obstacles.

11. In these circumstances I find that the judge made a material  error  of
    law and that the decision in relation to  Article  8  cannot  therefore
    stand.  Given that the errors relate both to the decision  to  consider
    Article  8  outside  the  Rules  and  the  assessment  in  relation  to
    proportionality I am satisfied that  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal should be set aside in its entirety.

Re-making the Decision

12. In re-making the decision I heard oral evidence from  the  Sponsor  and
    submissions from Ms Fijiwala and Mr Plowright and I reserve my decision
    which I give herein.

13. In assessing the appeal under Article 8 I consider the  guidance  given
    by the Court of Appeal in the case of SS (Congo).  It is not in dispute
    that at the time of the application the  Appellant  did  not  meet  the
    requirements of Appendix FM-SE in that the relevant  required  evidence
    had not been provided.

14. Mr Plowright submitted  that  Appendix  FM-SE  D(e)  gives  the  ECO  a
    discretion to look at whether there was a  the  valid  reason  why  the
    specified documents had not been submitted.  He relied on a letter from
    the Sponsor's employer dated 21st April 2015 (which he accepted was not
    before the ECO) explaining that the Sponsor had started  work  on  22nd
    May 2014 and that some of his pay was paid in cash but that from  April
    2015 it would all be made through the  Sponsor's  bank.   He  submitted
    that the fact that  this  discretion  had  not  been  exercised  was  a
    compelling reason for going on to consider Article 8. I do  not  accept
    this submission. This evidence was not before the ECO.  The  ECO  could
    not have exercised discretion on the basis of a 'valid reason' for  the
    absence of a specified document as he had  no  explanation  capable  of
    amounting to a valid reason before him.  Mr  Plowright  submitted  that
    the delay in this case is a compelling factor. The application was made
    in January 2015 and is now approaching two years since the application.
     However there was no significant delay in  the  making  of  the  ECO's
    decision and the Appellant had the option of making a fresh application
    when it became apparent that the evidential requirements were not  met.
    Mr Plowright submitted that there is no real dispute that  the  Sponsor
    does  earn  �18,600  and  that  in  his   submission   the   evidential
    requirements are there to ensure that someone  really  is  earning  the
    amount claimed and that there is no fraud.  However, as set out  in  SS
    (Congo), this in itself is not  a  compelling  reason  for  giving  the
    Appellant here preferential treatment.

15. In my view there is nothing in  this  case  which  would  entitle  this
    Appellant to preferential treatment over  other  applicants  for  entry
    clearance as a partner and therefore no compelling reason for going  on
    to consider this appeal outside the Immigration Rules.

16. However, for completeness I go on to consider Article  8.  Ms  Fijiwala
    accepted that family life exists between the Appellant and the Sponsor.
    I accept that the decision to refuse entry  clearance  interferes  with
    that family life and that such interference is in accordance  with  the
    law.

17. In considering proportionality I take into account the  Sponsor's  oral
    evidence that, although he was born in the UK, he last went to Pakistan
    in 2011 and had been there every year  before  that.   In  his  witness
    statement the Sponsor said that he was unable  to  go  to  Pakistan  up
    until May 2016 as a result of a conviction and sentence he had received
    in the UK which meant that he was subject  to  travel  restrictions  up
    until then.  However there appears to be  no  current  barrier  to  him
    going to Pakistan.

18. The Sponsor was  asked  why  the  Appellant  could  not  make  a  fresh
    application  in  light  of  the  current  evidence  as  to  the  income
    requirements and he said that there was a misunderstanding in  relation
    to the pay.

19. Mr Plowright submitted that it would be disproportionate to expect  the
    Appellant to make a fresh application for entry clearance  due  to  the
    length of time given that the substantive requirements have  been  met.
    When I asked him whether there was any reason why a  fresh  application
    had not been made since the refusal in  this  case,  he  accepted  that
    there appeared to be no reason except that the  Appellant  was  on  the
    path of an appeal and did not anticipate the delay or how things  would
    transpire. I take into account the delay but  the  other  side  of  the
    delay is that there appears to be no good reason why the Appellant  did
    not make a fresh application when the decision to refuse was  made  and
    it became apparent that the difficulty was in  the  specified  evidence
    requirements.

20. I take into account that the Sponsor speaks Punjabi. He  was  asked  in
    cross-examination was there any reason why he  could  not  relocate  to
    Pakistan and he said that he had a good job in the UK as an MOT  tester
    and he had no reason to go to Pakistan. Mr Plowright accepted that  the
    Sponsor has travelled to Pakistan  and  speaks  Punjabi.  Mr  Plowright
    properly accepted, in light of the high  test  applicable,  that  there
    probably were not insurmountable obstacles to the family  life  of  the
    Appellant and Sponsor continuing abroad.

21. I also consider the provisions of Section  117  of  the  2002  Act.  Ms
    Fijiwala accepted that the Appellant  speaks  English  but  this  is  a
    neutral factor.  Ms  Fijiwala  submitted  that  the  Appellant  is  not
    financially independent as she is supported by the Sponsor and  I  take
    this into account also.

22. In my view the issue  as  to  whether  the  substantive  or  evidential
    requirements can be met now is a matter which could be addressed  by  a
    fresh application.  I take  into  account  that  there  is  nothing  to
    prevent the Sponsor from travelling to Pakistan either  temporarily  or
    on a permanent basis and there are no insurmountable obstacles to  them
    continuing their family life in Pakistan.  In all of the  circumstances
    in this case I find that the refusal decision is proportionate  to  the
    Respondent's legitimate aim.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained an error of law and I  set
it aside.

I note that there is no challenge to  the  decision  under  the  Immigration
Rules and I maintain the decision of the First-tier Tribunal in relation  to
the Immigration Rules.

I re-make the decision by dismissing the appeal on human rights grounds.
