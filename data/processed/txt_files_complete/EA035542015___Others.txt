Representation:

For the Appellants:    No attendance

For the Respondent:    Mr Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer



                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellants, dates of birth [ ] 1984, [ ] 1985 and [ ] 2013 are  all
    citizens of Bangladesh. Having considered all the circumstances,  I  do
    not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.

 2. There was no attendance by anyone on behalf of the appellant. A  letter
    was received from the  appellants,  which  asked  that  the  matter  be
    adjourned by reason of the fact that the first named appellant was  ill
    and unfit to attend the Tribunal.

 3. The appellants are husband, wife and child of a single family unit. The
    appellants were applying for residence cards as extended family members
    of an EEA national who was  exercising  treaty  rights  in  the  United
    Kingdom. The  appeal  was  dealt  with  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Ferguson, who dismissed the appeal by determination dated 12 May  2017.
    The appellants are seeking to appeal  against  that  decision.  In  the
    first instance I have to determine whether or not there was an error of
    law in the decision.

 4. The respondent's representative asked  that  the  appeal  be  adjourned
    pending further consideration of the issues raised in  this  and  other
    cases of a similar kind by the Supreme Court. I refuse the applications
    to adjourn as I felt that on the face of the decision for  the  reasons
    set out below there were clear errors of law.

 5. The appellants  had  made  applications  for  EEA  residence  cards  as
    extended family members of an EEA national, who was  exercising  treaty
    rights in the United Kingdom. I note that the applications  had  to  be
    considered  under  the  Immigration   (EEA)   Regulations   2006.   The
    applications were refused by  the  respondent  by  decisions  dated  25
    November 2015. The appellants sought to appeal against the decisions.

 6. The appeals came before Judge Ferguson on the 10th May 2017. The  judge
    dismissed the appeals for want of jurisdiction in accordance  with  the
    law as stated in the case of Sala (EFMs: Rights of Appeal) [2016]  UKUT
    00411.

 7. The case of Sala has been overruled in the case of Khan [2017] EWCA Civ
    1755. The First-tier Tribunal Judge  in  following  the  case  of  Sala
    cannot be criticised as he was following the guidance set down  by  the
    Upper Tribunal. However given the statement of the law set down in Khan
    by the Court of Appeal the decision of the judge was legally flawed.

 8. For the reasons set out there is an error of law in the decision of the
    First-tier Tribunal. I set the decision aside.

 9. As no findings of fact had been made on the issues in the case the only
    courses is for this matter to be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to
    be heard afresh.

    Notice of Decision

10. I set aside the original decision of the First-tier Tribunal and  remit
    the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal for hearing afresh. The cases  to
    be remitted to be heard afresh at Taylor House.

11. I do not make an anonymity direction.
