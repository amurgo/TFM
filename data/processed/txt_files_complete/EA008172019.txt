For the Respondent:    Mr S Kotas, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Ghana.  His date of birth  is  1  October
    1992.  On 4 January 2019 he made an application for  a  residence  card
    pursuant to the Immigration (European Economic Area)  Regulations  2016
    ("the 2016 Regulations").

 2. This application was refused by the Secretary of State  on  1  February
    2019.  The Appellant appealed against the  decision.   His  appeal  was
    dismissed by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal P  Quinn  in  a  decision
    dated 18 August 2019 following a hearing at Hatton Cross  on  1  August
    2019.  Designated Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Manuell  granted
    permission to the Appellant on 6 December 2019.

 3. The application was made under Regulation 8 of  the  2016  Regulations.
    The Appellant's case was that he is an  extended  family  member  of  a
    person exercising treaty rights in the UK.  The Appellant's immigration
    history is that he came to the  UK  on  4  February  2018  having  been
    granted a family permit to join his aunt Jullana Sarfowaa,  an  Italian
    national excercising treaty  rights.  I  shall  refer  to  her  as  the
    Sponsor.  The Respondent accepted that during the  application  process
    the Appellant provided sufficient evidence of his relationship with the
    Sponsor and evidence of  prior  dependency.   However,  the  Respondent
    concluded that there was insufficient evidence to confirm that  he  was
    still reliant on the Sponsor as he claimed or that he was  residing  at
    the address with his Sponsor as claimed.

 4. The Appellant case was advanced on the basis of prior membership  of  a
    household and present membership of the Sponsor's household and present
    dependency.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal

 5. The Appellant  gave  evidence  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   His
    evidence was that he lived with the Sponsor and thus was member of  her
    household and it is on this basis that he met the requirements  of  the
    2016 Regulations.  The judge found that the evidence did not  establish
    on the balance of probabilities that the Appellant was living with  the
    Sponsor (see [23]). The Appellant's evidence was that he was  dependent
    on the Sponsor stating that she gave  him  �60  to  �100  a  week.  Her
    evidence was that she gave the Appellant �20  or  if  he  needed  more,
    maybe �21 or �23 per week. The evidence of the Sponsor was that she fed
    the Appellant and treated him as her son.  The Appellant's  uncle  said
    that the Sponsor gave the Appellant �20 pocket money.  The  judge  took
    into account that none of the witnesses mentioned in  their  statements
    how much financial support the Sponsor was giving to the Appellant  and
    that the Appellant's oral evidence was at odds with that of his Sponsor
    and uncle. The judge found, at [31], that in relation to dependency the
    evidence of the Appellant and the EEA Sponsor  was  "wildly  different"
    and this had persuaded him that the Appellant was not telling the truth
    and he treated his evidence with caution.

 6. The Appellant was not named  on  the  tenancy  agreement,  however  the
    Sponsor explained why this was.  She said that she had given the  names
    of the occupants to the council by the  time  that  the  Appellant  had
    arrived in the UK (see [28]).  The Appellant's  uncles  said  that  the
    family had been allocated new premises when the Appellant came  to  the
    UK and that is why he was not included on the  tenancy.   However,  the
    judge noted that the Appellant had arrived on 4 February 2018  and  yet
    the tenancy agreement was not signed until 14 March 2018  and  thus  he
    found that there had been ample time  to  inform  the  council  of  the
    Appellant's presence in the UK and to have him  added  on  the  tenancy
    which would have given him security and would have proved that  he  was
    living at that address. The judge did not accept the  uncle's  evidence
    that he had told  the  council  of  the  Appellant's  presence  at  the
    property. The judge found that "had they mentioned it to the council  I
    was of the belief that the council  would  have  inserted  him  in  the
    tenancy document as an authorised occupant".

 7. The judge attached weight to the absence of a  letter  from  the  local
    authority confirming that they  were  aware  of  the  presence  of  the
    Appellant at the address.  The Appellant was not on council tax records
    for the property. The judge said at [40] that he  would  have  expected
    the Appellant to have appeared on the council tax  bill  if  the  local
    authority were aware that he was living at the premises. The judge  did
    not find that the Sponsor and the  Appellant's  uncle  were  giving  an
    honest account of the situation.  The  judge  took  into  account  that
    there were a few letters addressed to the  Appellant  at  the  relevant
    address, but he found, at [32], that these did not establish  that  the
    Appellant was living there.   He  found  that  "the  senders  of  those
    letters would simply have sent them to the address  provided  and  they
    did not need to carry out any residence checks".

 8. The judge found that the uncle was  an  "unreliable"  witness.   Having
    noted his evidence was that the family had moved in March 2018 and that
    the Appellant had arrived in April  2018,  however  he  then  corrected
    himself and said that the Appellant came in February.  The judge  found
    that "his lack of certain knowledge about the Appellant's movements led
    me to believe that I was not being told the truth." At [41]  the  judge
    found as follows:

         "41. The evidence produced was not sufficient to persuade me to the
             evidential test that the Appellant was living  with  his  aunt
             and uncle and was dependent on them.  The fact that  the  Home
             Office had previously made a finding of dependency before  the
             Appellant came to the UK did not  necessarily  mean  that  the
             Appellant was still dependent  on  them.   In  any  event  the
             information supplied previously may not have been  genuine  in
             the light of what I have heard.

         42.  In my view the Appellant  had  failed  to  show  that  he  was
             dependent on his aunt and uncle and had failed to show that he
             was residing with them at their address".

 9. The  judge  concluded  at  paragraph  44  that  the  evidence  was  not
    sufficient  to  confirm  cohabitation  or  financial  dependency.    He
    concluded that he could not rely on any of the witnesses to give him an
    honest and straightforward account of the real situation.

The Grounds of Appeal

Ground 1

10. At paragraph 41 the judge intimates that the evidential  test  is  that
    the Appellant was living with his aunt and uncle and was  dependent  on
    them.  Having satisfied the prior dependency,  the  Appellant  was  not
    required to satisfy both dependency and membership of household.

11. The judge at [41] made  adverse  findings  regarding  evidence  already
    admitted by the Secretary of State in the Appellant's successful family
    permit application without having sight  of  the  same  or  giving  the
    Appellant an opportunity to respond.

12. At  [42]  the  First-tier  Tribunal  repeatedly  uses  the  term  "was"
    referring to the past.  The judge was required to consider the evidence
    at the date of the hearing.

13. The judge has failed to make findings in respect of crucial documentary
    evidence.  At page 40 of the Appellant's  bundle  there  is  a  tenancy
    agreement for 198A High Street for the  EEA  Sponsor.   The  First-tier
    Tribunal failed to adequately consider that this is consistent with the
    HMRC national insurance letter addressed to the Appellant at  the  same
    address (see page 62 of the Appellant's bundle).  In addition, on  page
    63 of the Appellant's  bundle  there  is  an  NHS  registration  letter
    addressed to the Appellant at 49 Cherry Road which correlates with  the
    tenancy agreement of the same address relating to the Sponsor that  can
    be found on page  54  of  the  Appellant's  bundle.   There  was  other
    evidence such as the Home Office refusal letters at page 64 and  65  of
    the Appellant's bundle addressed to the Appellant at both of the  above
    addresses.

14. On the issue of dependency the  Sponsor  and  the  Appellant's  uncle's
    evidence was consistent but the judge does not  make  a  finding  about
    this.

The Law

15. The issue in this case is whether the Appellant can establish  that  he
    was an extended family member of the EEA Sponsor.  The relevant law  is
    contained in the case of Dauhoo (EEA Regulations - reg 8(2))  Mauritius
    [2012] UKUT 79 which states as follows:

         "Under the scheme set out in reg 8(2) of the Immigration  (European
         Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006,  a  person   can   succeed   in
         establishing that he or she is an 'extended family member' in  any
         one of four different  ways,  each  of  which  requires  proving  a
         relevant connection both prior to arrival in the UK and in the UK:

         (i)  prior dependency and present dependency;

         (ii) prior membership of a household and present  membership  of  a
             household;

         (iii)    prior dependency and present membership of a household;

         (iv) prior membership of a household and present dependency".

Conclusions

16. I heard submissions from both representatives.

17. The Appellant has to establish that at the date of the hearing  he  was
    either a member of the Sponsor's household or present dependency on the
    Sponsor. It is asserted that the judge misunderstood the legal test and
    this is disclosed by what he says at [41] of  the  decision.   However,
    this  argument  is  undermined  by  the  fact  that  the  judge  having
    considered both dependency and membership of household,  found  against
    the Appellant on both. Moreover, from what the judge said at  paragraph
    44, it is clear that the judge understood the legal  test  and  applied
    it.

18. The judge at  [41]  stated  "in  any  event  the  information  supplied
    previously may not have been genuine  in  the  light  of  what  I  have
    heard".  This does not disclose an error of law.  The judge  was  aware
    that the Secretary of State had previously accepted that the  Appellant
    was dependent on the Sponsor before he came  to  the  UK,  however,  he
    rationally concluded  that  this  did  not  necessarily  mean  that  he
    continued to be dependent on them.  His finding must be  considered  in
    the context of the significant  discrepancy  in  the  evidence  of  the
    Appellant and the Sponsor (and the Appellant's  uncle).   It  is  clear
    from a proper reading of the  decision  that  the  judge  rejected  the
    evidence of dependency on the basis of the serious discrepancy.  Whilst
    he did not specifically refer to the evidence of  the  aunt  and  uncle
    being  reasonably  consistent,  this  was  not  arguably   capable   of
    rectifying the significant discrepancy between their evidence and  that
    of the Appellant.  The use of the past tense in [42] does not  disclose
    that the judge was  not  considering  whether  the  Appellant  met  the
    requirements of the 2016 Regulations at some day in the past.  A proper
    reading of the decision discloses that such a suggestion is unarguable.
     This argument was not pursued in oral submissions.

19. The judge at [32] accepted that there were a few letters  addressed  to
    the Appellant at the Sponsor's address.  It is unarguable that  he  did
    not take into account the documentary evidence identified at [6] of the
    grounds of appeal.  The judge took  this  evidence  into  account  when
    considering the evidence in the round.  It was  not  incumbent  on  the
    judge to identify each and every piece of evidence. His finding at [32]
    about them is rational.

20. On the basis of the  grounds  before  me  and  having  heard  Counsel's
    submissions on behalf of the Appellant, there is no properly identified
    error of law. The judge  considered  the  evidence  in  the  round  and
    reached conclusions that were open to him.

Notice of Decision

21. The decision of judge of the FtT to dismiss the appeal under  the  2016
    EEA Regulations is maintained.



No anonymity direction is made.
