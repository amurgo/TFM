                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Although the Appellant in these proceedings is the Secretary of State I
    refer to the parties as they were in the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The Appellant, a  citizen  of  Pakistan,  appealed  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal against a decision of the Secretary  of  State  made  on  10th
    February 2018 to refuse his application for indefinite leave to  remain
    in the UK on the  basis  of  ten  years'  long  residence.   First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Robertson allowed the appeal in a  decision  dated  15th
    November 2018.  The Secretary of State now  appeals  to  this  Tribunal
    with permission granted by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  O'Callaghan  on
    15th September 2018.

 3. The background is summarised at paragraph 7 of the First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge's decision.  There it is  stated  that  the  primary  reason  the
    Respondent refused the application was under paragraph  322(5)  of  the
    Immigration Rules on the basis of the Appellant's conduct.  In his Tier
    1 general leave application made in 2011 the Appellant claimed to  have
    had an income from self-employment.  He claimed to have a  turnover  of
    �62,788 and gross dividends of �51,188.89 for the  period  1st  October
    2010 to 4th April 2011.  On this basis he was awarded 30  points  under
    the previous earnings category and leave to  remain  was  granted.   It
    subsequently came to light that there were discrepancies in the figures
    provided and that no self-employment earnings had been recorded by HMRC
    for the tax year 2010/11.  It appears that amendments were made to  the
    tax returns for 2010/11 and  a  tax  calculation  for  HMRC  now  shows
    dividends of �51,188 and pay from  all  employment  of  �5,324.   These
    amendments were only made after a request was made by the  Home  Office
    for further information  and  were  made  in  the  knowledge  that  the
    Appellant would be called to account  when  applying  for  leave.   The
    Respondent did not accept that a genuine error occurred but  considered
    that the Appellant had failed to  provide  an  explanation  as  to  why
    amendments had been made to his tax return.  The  Respondent  concluded
    that the Appellant's character and conduct in relation to declaring his
    income led to a refusal of his application under the general grounds in
    paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules and that this accordingly led
    to a refusal under paragraph 276B of the Immigration Rules.

 4.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  considered  the  evidence  from  the
    Secretary  of  State  and  that  from  the  Appellant  and  found   the
    Appellant's explanation in relation to his tax return to  be  plausible
    and did not accept  that  paragraph  322(5)  was  a  valid  ground  for
    refusal.  The judge took into account the Appellant's circumstances and
    concluded that interference with the Appellant's right  to  family  and
    private life was not proportionate and allowed the appeal.

 5. It is contended in the Grounds of Appeal that the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge made a material misdirection of law  in  failing  to  follow  the
    reasoning in the decision in R (On the application of Khan) v Secretary
    of State for the Home Department  (Dishonesty,  tax  return,  paragraph
    322(5)) [2018] UKUT 00384 (IAC).  Reliance is placed on head notes (iv)
    and (v) of the decision in Khan and it is contended that the judge  did
    not follow the recommended steps in Khan  when  assessing  whether  the
    Appellant acted dishonestly in his dealings with HMRC.   It is  further
    contended that the judge failed to follow the guidance in the cases  of
    R (On the application of Samant) v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2017] UK AIT JR/6546/2016 and Abbasi JR/13807/2016 in  that
    she placed significant emphasis on the fact that the Appellant had  not
    been penalised or prosecuted by HMRC for submitting incorrect  or  late
    tax returns.  It is contended that  the  view  of  HMRC  regarding  the
    treatment of arrears is not relevant to an assessment  under  paragraph
    322(5) and that this does not address the possibility that the original
    tax returns were correct but the Appellant falsified higher earnings in
    order to qualify under Tier 1.

 6. As highlighted in the grant of permission to  appeal  the  decision  in
    Khan was reported after the oral hearing in this appeal  but  prior  to
    the promulgation of  the  judge's  decision  and  reasons.   The  judge
    granting permission considered it  arguable  that  the  judge  had  not
    followed the steps now identified as applicable by the  Upper  Tribunal
    in Khan.

 7. In the case of Khan Mr Justice Martin  Spencer  set  out  the  approach
    which should be followed as follows:

         "(i) Where there has been  a  significant  difference  between  the
         income claimed in a previous application for leave  to  remain  and
         the income declared to HMRC, the Secretary of State is entitled  to
         draw  an  inference  that  the  Applicant  has  been  deceitful  or
         dishonest and therefore he should be refused ILR  within  paragraph
         322(5) of the  Immigration  Rules.   Such  an  inference  could  be
         expected  where  there  is  no  plausible   explanation   for   the
         discrepancy.


         (ii) Where an  Applicant  has  presented  evidence  to  show  that,
         despite the prima facie inference, he was not in fact dishonest but
         only careless, then the Secretary of State must decide whether  the
         explanation and evidence is sufficient, in her  view,  to  displace
         the prima facie inference of deceit/dishonesty.


         (iii)    In approaching that fact-finding task,  the  Secretary  of
         State should remind herself that, although the standard of proof is
         the "balance of probability", a finding  that  a  person  has  been
         deceitful and dishonest in relation to his  tax  affairs  with  the
         consequence that he is denied settlement in this country is a  very
         serious finding with serious consequences.


         (iv) For an Applicant simply to blame his or her accountant for  an
         "error" in relation to the historical tax return will  not  be  the
         end of the matter, given that the accountant will  or  should  have
         asked the tax payer to confirm that the return was accurate and  to
         have signed the tax return. Furthermore  the  Applicant  will  have
         known of his or her earnings and will  have  expected  to  pay  tax
         thereon.  If the Applicant does not take steps within a  reasonable
         time to remedy  the  situation,  the  Secretary  of  State  may  be
         entitled to conclude that this failure justifies a conclusion  that
         there has been deceit or dishonesty.


         (v)  When considering whether or not the Applicant is dishonest  or
         merely  careless  the  Secretary  of  State  should  consider   the
         following matters, inter alia, as well as the extent to which  they
         are evidenced (as opposed to asserted):


             i.   Whether the explanation for the error by  the  accountant
             is plausible;


             ii.  Whether the documentation which can be assumed  to  exist
             (for example, correspondence between  the  Applicant  and  his
             accountant at the time of the tax return) has  been  disclosed
             or there is a plausible explanation for why it is missing;


             iii. Why the Applicant did not realise that an error had  been
             made because his liability to pay tax was less than he  should
             have expected;


             iv.  Whether, at any stage, the Applicant has taken  steps  to
             remedy the situation and, if so, when those steps  were  taken
             and the explanation for any significant delay."


 8. Mr Justice Spencer stated in paragraph 32  of  the  decision  that  the
    starting point is that,  where  the  Secretary  of  State  discovers  a
    significant  difference  between  the  income  claimed  in  a  previous
    application for leave to remain and in the income declared to HMRC, she
    is entitled to draw an inference that the applicant has been  deceitful
    or dishonest and therefore he should be refused  ILR  within  paragraph
    322(5) of the Immigration Rules.  However it states that  it  does  not
    follow that in all such cases a decision to refuse ILR will be  lawful.
    Where an applicant has presented evidence to  show  that,  despite  the
    prima facie inference, he was not in fact dishonest but only  careless,
    then the Secretary of State is presented with a fact-finding task which
    must be carried out fairly and  lawfully.   Spencer  J  said  that  the
    Secretary of State needs to remind him or herself:

         "That a finding that a person has been deceitful and  dishonest  in
         relation to his tax affairs  with  the  consequence  he  is  denied
         settlement in this country is a very serious finding  with  serious
         consequences and therefore the evidence must be cogent  and  strong
         although as the authorities show the standard of proof  remains  on
         the balance of probabilities."

 9. The First-tier Tribunal Judge made findings in relation to  this  issue
    at paragraphs 13 and 14 of the decision.  The judge began by  accepting
    that the Respondent was  entitled  to  make  an  adverse  inference  of
    dishonesty from  the  evidence  of  a  large  discrepancy  between  the
    apparent figures declared to the HMRC and the relevant tax  return  and
    the actual income earned which was submitted to the  Respondent.   This
    is consistent with paragraph (i) of the guidance in the  head  note  in
    the case of Khan.

10. The judge  then  went  on  to  say  that  the  decision  was  based  on
    information from HMRC that no self-assessment tax record was  held  for
    the years 2010/11.  The judge accepted the evidence in  a  letter  from
    HMRC that the tax return for 2010/11 was received late  on  5th  August
    2016  and  was  not  amended.   The  judge  found  on  the  balance  of
    probabilities that the tax return was in fact filed  late  rather  than
    having been an amended tax return.   The  judge  did  not  consider  it
    likely that the Appellant gained any immigration advantage as a  result
    of failing to submit his tax return at the appropriate time.

11. In my view it is clear that the situation outlined in paragraph 13  and
    accepted by the judge differs from the scenario in Khan where  the  tax
    return understated tax payable.

12. The judge went on to consider this further at paragraph  14  where  she
    noted that the 2010/11 tax return was the first one to be submitted  by
    the Appellant as a self-employed person.  The judge said that:

         "Whilst it is not sufficient simply to blame the accountant I  have
         heard from the Appellant that his personal  circumstances  at  that
         time were particularly stressful.   He  was  challenging  the  Home
         Office decision in relation to leave and his  mother  was  ill.   I
         note that his financial affairs were scrutinised at  that  time  by
         the Home Office but it was not picked up that no  return  had  been
         filed.  The responsibility does of course lie  with  the  Appellant
         but I find his explanation for the oversight to be plausible."

13. It is clear that the judge accepted the Appellant's explanation for the
    failure to lodge a tax return.  The judge also found that the Appellant
    had made efforts to rectify his accounts with HMRC upon  realising  the
    error.  The judge therefore took into account the Appellant's  actions.
    I note the Appellant's evidence that he had become self-employed  since
    September 2010 and hired an accountant who had failed to submit his tax
    return and that the Appellant was going through a difficult time as his
    mother was receiving chemotherapy and he  had  been  refused  leave  to
    remain which was subsequently overturned.  The Appellants evidence  was
    that he had been stressed and depressed which had  contributed  to  the
    closure of the business.  The judge noted the Appellant's evidence that
    the Appellant did not realise the error until  he  was  organising  his
    affairs for a mortgage application and  his  evidence  that  it  was  a
    genuine mistake.  It is clear that the judge took into account  all  of
    the Appellant's evidence as  set  out  at  paragraph  8  and  that  she
    accepted the Appellant's explanation in  relation  to  the  failure  to
    lodge a tax return in 2010/11.

14. The judge considered  the  issue  of  HMRC's  actions  at  the  end  of
    paragraph 14 where she said; "I note in particular that he has incurred
    no financial penalties as a result.   Had  HMRC  found  deliberate  tax
    avoidance he would have been penalised".  The Secretary  of  State  has
    criticised this finding in light of the decisions in Samant and  Abbasi
    however it is clear to me that the judge took this into account as  one
    factor rather than a determinative factor in relation to this matter.

15. In my view it is clear  looking  at  the  decision  as  a  whole  that,
    although the judge did not make explicit reference to the  decision  of
    Khan or the guidance therein, there is no material  error  because  the
    judge's approach was consistent with that  taken  in  the  decision  in
    Khan.  The judge  considered  all  of  the  evidence,  found  that  the
    Secretary of State  was  entitled  to  make  an  adverse  inference  of
    dishonesty and then  engaged  with  the  evidence  from  the  Appellant
    finding that it was not enough  to  simply  blame  the  accountant  and
    looking at the facts and the evidence as to why there was a discrepancy
    between the income declared in the Appellant's application for leave to
    remain and the failure to file a tax return.  In my view the judge gave
    sustainable reasons for accepting  the  Appellant's  explanations.  The
    findings were open to her on the evidence.
