Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Barr, legal representative
For the Respondent:    Mr Govan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an  appeal  under  the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2016 ("the  EEA  Regulations").   The  challenge  is  to  a
    decision of the respondent made on 24 November 2017 to refuse to issue
    them with a residence card as confirmation of their right to reside  as
    the carers of an EEA national child  (their  son).   The  decision  was
    taken on the basis that they had not provided adequate evidence to show
    that their son was a self-sufficient person as it was  not  permissible
    for him to rely on  income  from  the  parents  unless  it  was  lawful
    employment.

 2. On appeal to the First-tier Tribunal, the judge took the view that  the
    appellant did not meet the requirements of the EEA Regulations  as  the
    child was not sufficient.  He reached that conclusion on the basis that
    there was insufficient evidence of the appellant  trading  as  claimed;
    that the accounts provided were unaudited, it not  being  clear  either
    what the day-to-day expenditure was [19] and  what  was  savings  [20].
    That was in addition to the fact that the appellant had known that  the
    appellant had no legal  status  such  that  he  was  entitled  to  work
    legitimately.  The judge was not satisfied either that there was, as is
    required by the Regulations, comprehensive medical insurance in  place.



 3. The judge although asked to follow the decision of the Court of  Appeal
    of Northern Ireland in Bajratari v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2017] NICA 74, declined to do so, deciding  to  follow  the
    decisions from the Court of Appeal in England and Wales.

 4. Permission to appeal against that decision was granted and  the  matter
    then came before me in Belfast on 6 June 2019.  For the reasons set out
    in that decision I found that the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    involved the making of an error of  law.   Subsequent  to  my  decision
    which was given orally, Advocate General Szpunar produced  his  opinion
    in Bajratari which by then had reached the European Court  of  Justice.
    Subsequent to my decision, the European Court of  Justice  handed  down
    its decision as Bajratari [2019] EUECJ C-98/18.

 5. At the resumed hearing, Mr Barr sought to rely on  written  submissions
    and a bundle of material said  to  contain  "up-to-date  proof  of  the
    appellant's situation.

 6. At the outset of the hearing it was agreed that, in light of the  Court
    of Justice's decision, the sole  issue  was  whether  there  was  self-
    sufficient.  Mr Barr submitted that there was evidence that the  family
    all had comprehensive health insurance and that the material from  page
    26 in  the  bundle  onwards  from  HM  Revenue  &  Customs  showed  the
    appellant's income.  He explained that the paperwork for the  tax  year
    2018 to 2019 had not yet been completed.  Mr Barr drew my attention  to
    the fact that the  appellant  owns  a  house  which  is  subject  to  a
    mortgage.

 7. In response to my questions, Mr Barr was unable to  tell  me  what  the
    monthly outgoings were and, when asked what the income  had  been  over
    the last eighteen months, referred me to the bank statements from  page
    69 onwards.  He submitted it could be inferred that the appellant could
    meet his expenses, paid his bills as the business has not folded.

 8. Mr Govan submitted that what was missing was any sort  of  evidence  to
    establish  the  appellant's  current  evidence,  a  breakdown  of   his
    circumstances, how he supports  his  children  and  what  his  personal
    expenses are.  He submitted that the new evidence did not address  what
    he described as an "evidential void".

 9. Mr Govan submitted that in any event the profits shown in each tax year
    were low and as regards the savings account which it is said  contained
    savings available to the family which has been  amassed  through  money
    given to them by the extended family and friends, need not  necessarily
    be available to him.  In response,  Mr  Barr  sought  to  rely  on  his
    written submissions, adding that it was clear that  the  appellant  did
    not need to rely on the funds in the savings account and that there was
    sufficient evidence to show that he is self-sufficient.

10. In the circumstances, I permitted Mr Barr  to  produce  a  schedule  of
    income and expenditure within seven days and to permit Mr Govan to make
    written submissions in response.  I  have  taken  both  of  these  into
    account in reaching my decision.

The Law

11. The issue in this case is whether the child is  self-sufficient  within
    the meaning of the EEA Regulations, taking into account  the  resources
    of the parents.  Self-sufficiency is defined by reference to Regulation
    4 which provides as follows:

         (c)  "self-sufficient person" means a person who has-


             (i)  sufficient resources not to become a burden on the social
             assistance system of the United Kingdom during the person's
             period of residence; and


             (ii) comprehensive sickness insurance cover in the United
             Kingdom;


12. The key phrase is  whether  the  person  in  question  has  "sufficient
    resources so as to avoid being a burden on the social assistance of the
    host member state" which in this case involves assessing  the  position
    of the parents.

13. Despite that being the issue before me, neither party sought to address
    me as to its meaning, still less to address me and any of the  relevant
    case law before me.  Some assistance as to the meaning of  this  phrase
    can be drawn from SG v Tameside [2010] UKUT and Brey  [2013]  EUECJ  C-
    140/12, as well as AMS v SSWP (PC) [2017] UKUT 48 (AAC).

14. The Upper Tribunal's task has been rendered even more difficult by  the
    failure by the appellant to provide a proper  schedule  of  income  and
    expenditure.  Whilst that has now, to a limited extent, been  rectified
    by the production of what purports to  be  a  schedule  of  income  and
    expenditure to 31 August  2019,  that  is  defective  in  a  number  of
    respects.  There is a distinct lack of detail  in  terms  of  what  the
    business expenses are and whilst it is said that the drawings from  the
    business are �21,676.01 and these appear to cover a number  of  things,
    it seems to say the least implausible that food would account for  only
    �196.79 for twelve months.  It is unclear also why the wife's wages  at
    �4,416 are seen as a drawing of the business and also one would assume,
    an expense of the business before there are drawings.

15. On any view, given that the drawings are in excess of  profit  by  over
    �4,000, the income from the business is not sufficient for the family's
    expenses.  Further, there is an anomaly, in that although the  schedule
    of income and expenditure shows  money  received  from  the  family  as
    �20,201.48 through July 2019 the most recent  instant  saver  statement
    dated 12 December 2019 shows no withdrawals during the entirety of the
    period covered, that is 9 November 2018 to 9 December 2019 so there  is
    no evidence that this sum, included in income, has in fact been  spent.
    Further, the earlier statement which covers 26 July  2018  to  25  July
    2019 shows no withdrawals either.

16. In short, I am not satisfied that the profit and loss account  provided
    or the schedule of income and expenditure provides an accurate  account
    of the family's income, making it impossible to assess properly whether
    there is self-sufficiency within the meaning of the Regulations.  It is
    simply not good enough to submit that because  the  mortgage  has  been
    paid and other bills have been paid that there are sufficient resources
    available.

17. While I accept that the money in the account has  been  paid  into  the
    account by a small number off depositors, primarily S and  PS  Fashions
    and Kul Vinder Singh I have only the appellant's word for it that these
    are tips.

18. Nonetheless, despite Mr Govan's submissions, I accept that these  would
    be available to the appellant as a matter of law and certainly would be
    treated as savings belonging to  him  for  the  purposes  of  assessing
    benefits.  For example, the level is such that the appellant would  not
    be entitled to universal credit, income  support  or  housing  benefit,
    still less would he be entitled to council tax benefit.   He  would  be
    entitled to working or child tax credit as the assessment  of  that  is
    based on taxable income and the  interest  earned  by  the  account  is
    considerably less than the �300 which is the minimum amount which is to
    be taken into account.

19. In light of the observation that despite it being  presented  that  the
    appellant is reliant on funds in the instant saver account,  yet  there
    are no withdrawals, I am satisfied that in reality these funds are  not
    available to the appellant  and  that  the  savings  account  does  not
    provide an accurate view of the funds available to the appellant.  They
    may well be in his  name  but  that  in  the  facts  of  this  case  is
    insufficient given the discrepancies in the evidence.

20. Accordingly, the appellant  has  failed  to  demonstrate  that  he  has
    sufficient resources available such that the child is a self-sufficient
    person.  I accept  that  the  requirement  for  comprehensive  sickness
    insurance is met but the other  requirement  is  not.   Accordingly,  I
    dismiss the appeal.

Notice of Decision

 1) The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law and I set it aside.

 2) I remake the appeal by dismissing  the  appeal  under  the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016.

No anonymity direction is made.
