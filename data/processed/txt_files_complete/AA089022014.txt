Representation:

For the claimant: Ms K Smith, instructed by TRP Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr J Parkinson, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge  Hollingworth  promulgated  2.10.15,  allowing  the
    claimant's appeal against the decision of the  Secretary  of  State  to
    refuse his asylum, humanitarian protection and human rights claims  and
    to remove him from the UK.  The Judge heard the appeal on 21.8.15.

 2.  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Reid  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    23.10.15.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 15.3.16 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the decision of Judge Hollingworth should be set aside.

 5. The issues in claimant's asylum claim  can  be  summarised  briefly  as
    follows. He helped plan, organising propaganda, and  then  participated
    in the 1989 student protests. He was beaten  in  June  1989,  with  the
    result of losing sight in both eyes. He has also practiced  Falun  Gong
    in secret since 1995. He has been fined for having a second  and  third
    child and is not willing to comply with China's family planning policy,
    intending to have as many children  as  nature  will  permit  with  his
    current wife, but does not yet have any  children  with  her.  A  close
    friend of his father who worked for the police advised him that  people
    who knew he was involved in the 1989  demonstration  were  arrested  in
    March 2014 as they were planning to commemorate the 25th anniversary of
    the event. He fears  that  they  will  inform  the  government  of  his
    involvement, as he was also  planning  with  them  to  commemorate  the
    anniversary by holding a secret candlelight memorial.

 6. The Secretary of State did not accept that he had participated  in  the
    1989 protests and did not give him  the  benefit  of  the  doubt  under
    paragraph 339L as to whether his friends were arrested  in  March  2014
    for their intention  to  commemorate  the  anniversary.  Based  on  his
    apparent lack of knowledge of Falun Gong at  interview,  his  claim  to
    practice it was rejected. His second wife has had no  children  of  her
    own and is entitled to have at least one child before being fined. Even
    if he was a practiser of Falun Gong, it is not accepted that  he  would
    be at risk on return.

 7. The reasons for refusal letter raises a series  of  credibility  issues
    based on his answers or unwillingness/inability to answer questions. In
    particular, the Secretary of State relied  on  inconsistencies  in  the
    claimant's asylum interview account,  including  as  to  his  claim  to
    practice Falun Gong. He was unable to name any of the five  Falun  Gong
    exercises and was only able to demonstrate one on  the  second  day  of
    interviews, after having the opportunity to research the matter in  the
    public domain overnight. Although he did not  challenge  the  screening
    interview, the claimant did not  accept  the  accuracy  of  the  asylum
    interview and sent  detailed  corrections  and  clarifications  to  the
    interviewing officer some time after the interviews.

 8. Noting that the claimant is not only blind but has hearing difficulties
    (in one ear), Judge Hollingworth considered that the procedures adopted
    at  the  interview  were  insufficient  for  the  claimant's   physical
    difficulties and no additional  safeguards  were  provided.  The  judge
    found that it would have been necessary for at least the first  tranche
    of the interview to have been read back to  the  appellant  "to  ensure
    that the (Claimant) had expressed himself in the way in which he sought
    to  do.  I  find,  therefore,  that  the  foundation  for  the  edifice
    constructed by the respondent in analysing and criticising the  answers
    given by the appellant is insufficient to support that edifice."

 9. At �39 the judge accepted the claimant's factual account and found that
    imputed political opinion had been made out and a real risk or  serious
    possibility of harm exists, and  thus  allowed  the  appeal  on  asylum
    grounds. The judge also allowed the appeal on human rights grounds  for
    the same reasons. At �41 the judge did not reach a  conclusion  on  the
    Falun Gong claim, stating that in light of the asylum and human  rights
    findings "It is otiose in these circumstances to consider  whether  the
    (claimant) would be at risk on the basis of his practising Falun Gong."
    The judge then added, "With regard to internal relocation I do not find
    that this is either reasonable  or  practicable  given  the  source  of
    persecution and the scope of operations of agents of the State.  It  is
    otiose to consider the other limbs of the appeal."

10. In summary, the grounds argue that the First-tier Tribunal Judge failed
    to give reasons for his conclusion on a material  matter,  namely  that
    the claimant was at risk by virtue of his  imputed  political  opinion;
    that at �35 the judge was  unclear  on  what  basis  the  Secretary  of
    State's  interview  procedures  could  have  been  improved  for   this
    claimant; that the judge failed to engage fully with the evidence or to
    give reasons  why  the  claimant  would  now  be  of  interest  to  the
    authorities, 25 years after the events described; the judge misdirected
    himself and failed to make clear findings about the claimant's practice
    of Falun Gong.

11. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Reid found it arguable that the
    judge did not make adequate findings in respect of the risk  on  return
    some 25 years after the event and  failed  to  adequately  analyse  the
    Falun Gong issue.  In  addition,  "It  is  arguable  that  the  judge's
    conclusions on the weight to be given  to  the  interview  answers  are
    lacking in reasoning."

12. Ms Smith relied on the claimant's Rule  24  response,  under  cover  of
    letter dated 10.11.15, and amplified in her  oral  submissions  to  me,
    which I have carefully considered.

13. For the reasons summarised below, I find that the judge's  approach  to
    and assessment of the asylum interview, and the consequent dismissal of
    the Secretary of State's reliance on inconsistencies and criticisms  of
    the claimant's account, to be flawed and in error of law  for  want  of
    adequate and rational reason.

14. I accept that Judge Hollingworth suggested at �35  how  the  procedures
    could, in his view, have been improved or better.  However,  the  judge
    failed to explain in what way those or any other proposals  would  have
    addressed the credibility issues  raised  by  the  Secretary  of  State
    arising from that interview. The Rule 24 response of the claimant  also
    fails to engage with this point.

15.  As  Mr  Parkinson  pointed  out,  the  claimant's  rebuttal  statement
    disputing the inconsistencies in his asylum interview related  entirely
    to alleged interpreter issues and not to any difficulties arising  from
    any visual or auditory impairment, or other  disability.  He  makes  no
    assertion he was unable to understand the interview  questions  because
    of any disability. Neither did he suggest in the first day of interview
    that he could not understand or misunderstood what was being  asked  of
    him. In fact, reading the interview it appears that he gave  clear  and
    detailed answers to the  questions  asked  of  him.  Nothing  from  the
    interview  transcript  suggests  that  he  might   have   been   having
    difficulties understanding. At �17 of the refusal decision it is  noted
    that the claimant twice confirmed he understood the interpreter. At  no
    stage on the first day did  he  raise  any  issue  about  understanding
    questions or the interpreter. It was only on the  second  day  that  he
    cryptically claimed he could not guarantee that he understood  all  the
    questions. Asked AT  Q240  to  identify  which  questions  he  did  not
    understand, he said he was unable to say now. Asked why  he  could  not
    say whether he understood particular questions, he  was  unable  to  do
    anything other than repeat his initial statement,  stating,  "I  cannot
    determine which questions now. There are  many  misunderstandings  from
    yesterday."

16. Given that he failed to mention any such problems with the  interpreter
    when specifically asked, and only raised these  after  the  interviews,
    the  Secretary  of  State  does  not  accept  that   there   were   any
    communication problems and in effect his post-interview representations
    was an attempt to revise or rationalise the evidence he  had  given  in
    his interview answers.

17. It was only in post-interview  representations  that  he  claimed  that
    there were many interpreter translation errors. He is described in  the
    refusal decision as highly educated  and  assertive  and  his  detailed
    witness statement comprising 22 pages is articulate  and  comprehensive
    in his attempts to clarify, add, or comment on  the  refusal  decision,
    all of which suggests that he was perfectly  capable  of  understanding
    the questions asked. I note that much of his rebuttal witness statement
    seeks to add or clarify what was said in interview.

18. On the facts set out above, I accede to the submission that the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge has failed to provide any adequate  cogent  reasons
    why reading back to the claimant of the first part of the interview  by
    the same interpreter would have addressed  the  concerns  the  claimant
    subsequently raised.

19. As the approach to the interview was also integral and crucial  to  the
    overall assessment of the claimant's credibility, this  error  vitiates
    the finding as to the credibility of the appellant's factual account to
    have been involved in the 1989 protests and that he  was  planning  the
    2014  anniversary  commemoration,  rendering  the   decision   in   the
    unsustainable.

20. Further, the judge declined to address the Falun  Gong  issue,  stating
    that it was otiose to do so,  and  thus  there  has  been  no  adequate
    assessment of that issue.

21. In summary, the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  cannot  stand  and
    must be set aside in its entirety.

22. When a decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside,  section
    12(2) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 requires either
    that the case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  with  directions,
    or it must be remade by the Upper Tribunal. The scheme of the Tribunals
    Court and Enforcement Act 2007 does not assign the function of  primary
    fact finding to the  Upper  Tribunal.  The  errors  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge vitiates all other findings of fact and the  conclusions
    from those facts so that there has not been a  valid  determination  of
    the issues in the appeal.

23. In all the circumstances, at the invitation and request of both parties
    to relist this appeal for a fresh hearing in the First-tier Tribunal, I
    do so on the basis that this is a case which falls squarely within  the
    Senior President's Practice Statement at paragraph 7.2. The  effect  of
    the error has been to deprive the parties of a fair  hearing  and  that
    the nature or extent of any judicial fact finding  which  is  necessary
    for the decision in the appeal to  be  re-made  is  such  that,  having
    regard to the overriding objective in rule 2 to deal with cases  fairly
    and justly, including with the avoidance of delay, I find  that  it  is
    appropriate  to  remit  this  appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    determine the appeal afresh.

Conclusions:

24. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making  of  an  error  on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I set aside set aside the decision.

     I remit the decision to be remade afresh in the First-tier Tribunal.

Consequential Directions

25. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal at Stoke on Trent;

26. The appeal is to be reheard afresh with no findings of fact preserved;

27. The appeal may be heard by  any  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  with  the
    exception of Judge Hollingworth;

28. The estimated length of hearing is 3-4 hours;

29. An interpreter in Mandarin Chinese will be required;

30. Not later than 15 working day before the relisting of the appeal in the
    First-tier Tribunal the claimant shall serve on the Secretary of  State
    and lodge with the Tribunal  two  copies  of  a  single,  consolidated,
    paginated and indexed bundle, comprising all subjective  and  objective
    materials to be relied on, together with copies  of  any  case  law  or
    guidance to be relied on, and any skeleton argument. The Tribunal  will
    not accept materials submitted on the day of the hearing.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal made an order pursuant.
Given the circumstances, I continue the anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable in this case and thus there can be no fee award.
