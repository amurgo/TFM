                            DECISION AND REASONS



Introduction

 1. This is the remaking of an appeal against the decision of the Secretary
    of State to refuse the appellants' human rights appeal  in  a  decision
    dated 17 January 2018. In a decision promulgated on 19 August  2019,  I
    found that the First-tier Tribunal made material errors of law  in  its
    determination of this matter and set that decision aside. That decision
    is annexed.

 2.  The  Secretary  of  State  refused  the   appellants'   human   rights
    applications for the following reasons. Firstly, it was said  that  the
    applications fell  for  refusal  on  suitability  grounds  because  the
    respondent requested medical records which were  not  provided  by  the
    deadline of 25  September  2017.  Secondly,  the  applicants  were  all
    Iranian nationals, without leave to remain and who had resided  in  the
    United Kingdom for three years at the date  of  the  applications.  The
    respondent considered  whether  the  health  of  the  second  appellant
    amounted to exceptional circumstances but concluded  that  the  limited
    evidence of medical appointments provided did not show that the  second
    appellant's then medical condition would meet the  high  threshold  for
    consideration under Article 3. Reference was also made  to  the  second
    appellant's care of  her  mother  who  was  ill  at  the  time  of  the
    application but subsequently died.

Anonymity

 3. An anonymity direction is made owing  to  references  to  the  personal
    circumstances of the minor appellants.

The hearing

 4. Mr Symes advised me  that  he  was  intending  to  proceed  by  way  of
    submissions alone, but the appellants  had  attended  the  hearing  and
    could be cross-examined. He added that the  First-tier  Tribunal  judge
    had accurately summarised the evidence. Mr Melvin commented that he had
    not been provided with the evidence which  was  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal. Nonetheless he was happy to proceed on submissions only.

 5. Mr Symes summarised the appellants' circumstances. They arrived in  the
    UK in August 2013 under the Tier  1  Investor  route.  Their  extension
    application failed owing to incompetence by their previous  immigration
    advisors. While accepting that their presence in the UK was precarious,
    Mr Symes  emphasised  that  the  investor  route  normally  results  in
    settlements after 5 years. Consequently, the appellants  were  entitled
    to uproot and sell their property in Iran. EJ2 was born in 2010 and was
    aged 3 when she arrived in the United Kingdom, whereas EJ1 was  aged  8
    when he arrived. While neither child had lived in  the  United  Kingdom
    for 7 years, they had spent a significant  proportion  of  their  lives
    here.  In  arguing  that  the  decision  to  expel   the   family   was
    disproportionate, Mr Symes referred to the evidence of  HJ  as  to  the
    steps taken with a view  to  settling  in  the  United  Kingdom,  SRL's
    evidence regarding the children as well as the  report  of  the  social
    worker,  Julie  Meek,  in  relation  to  the  concerns  of  the   minor
    appellants. The minor appellants had also written  letters.  EJ2  spoke
    very little Farsi and attempts to teach her had been unsuccessful.  The
    social worker's  report  included  analysis  of  relevant  research  in
    relation to drastic change, anxiety and  the  impact  on  learning.  Mr
    Symes argued that it was not in the best interests of the  children  to
    be removed to Iran and that it would be disproportionate to do so.

 6. Turning to the appellants' immigration history, Mr  Symes  referred  to
    the  Rules  and  identified  what  went  wrong  with  their   extension
    application. The previous immigration advisor had provided quarterly as
    opposed to annual financial reports, which wrongly gave the  impression
    that the market value of the second appellant's investments had  fallen
    below one million pounds at the  relevant  time.  The  mistake  of  the
    previous advisor led to a misunderstanding by the Home Office about the
    reporting periods.

 7. With reference to the letter from Anderson Ross dated 15 December 2016,
    Mr Symes explained that had the investment dipped at the end of October
    2014, they would have advised action, however the investment  was  over
    ï¿½750,000 and this combined with the property purchased  by  the  second
    appellant meant that the total sum invested in the United  Kingdom  was
    in excess of one million pounds. Mr Symes argued that  the  appellants'
    previous immigration advisor confused the Secretary of State by showing
    interim reports, each for less than one million pounds. The Home Office
    therefore  concluded  that  there  had  been  dips  in  the  level   of
    investment, but on an annual basis there was no dip below  one  million
    pounds.

 8. Mr Symes acknowledged that  there  had  been  no  complaint  about  the
    advisor or to a regulator. He argued that it was unlikely that  someone
    would admit their mistake in any event. Anderson Ross, in the letter of
    15 December 2016, attributed the error to the immigration  advisor  who
    did  not  understand  the  difference  between  quarterly  and   annual
    reporting. It was not too late  to  consider  this  matter  as  it  was
    relevant to Article 8.   In  relation  to  the  precariousness  of  the
    appellants' residence, there were differing degrees. The derailment  of
    their previous application was outside the control  of  the  appellants
    and could be considered by the Upper Tribunal. As for section  117B  of
    the 2002 Act, the appellants were proficient in English and financially
    independent. The children  had  developed  private  lives  outside  the
    family unit, thus rendering the decision disproportionate.

 9. Mr Melvin submitted a skeleton argument, which  he  relied  upon  along
    with the respondent's decision refusing leave to remain on human rights
    grounds. He argued that the  appellants  could  not  meet  any  of  the
    Immigration Rules  and  therefore  it  was  a  matter  of  looking  for
    exceptional circumstances. The appellants were granted entry  clearance
    for 3 years in 2013 and since then  had  been  pursuing  administrative
    review of the decision to refuse to extend their  leave  to  remain  as
    well as this human rights claim. The family would be expected to return
    to Iran together. He acknowledged that EJ1 was studying for his  GCSE's
    as well as the evidence that he had expressed a fear of the development
    of suicidal thoughts because his uncle committed suicide owing to being
    called up for military service. While both children expressed fears  of
    return, neither an asylum claim, nor Article 3 claim had been made.  Mr
    Melvin dismissed the evidence relating to the children as an attempt to
    bolster the human rights claim, as there would be no fear  of  the  son
    performing military service as it would be 4 more  years  before  event
    raised its head. He contended that there was potential  for  people  to
    buy their way out of military service, which was to be  viewed  against
    the backdrop of a family who were wealthy, in Iranian terms.

10. As for the evidence relating to EJ2 regarding the restrictions of  life
    in Iran and that she associates it with death owing to 3  bereavements,
    Mr Melvin argued that these were preferences rather than fears  as  the
    family would be  returning  together.  There  were  no  welfare  issues
    regarding either children on return.  As  the  family  were  relatively
    wealthy, the children would be in the best schools.  Mr  Melvin  argued
    that it was in the best interests of children to return to  Iran,  that
    they had not built up a sufficient private life in the  United  Kingdom
    and did not meet the high threshold test of exceptionality.  He  argued
    that the minor appellants have a large extended family  in  Iran,  some
    experience of language and culture and should not be deprived of  their
    heritage. While the son would be two years behind with  his  education,
    private tutors could be brought in and within a  short  space  of  time
    could quickly remedy the daughters' reluctance to learn Farsi.

11. Mr Melvin dismissed the social worker's report as  an  attempt  by  the
    family to bolster a weak Article  8  claim.  He  did  not  accept  that
    removal would create distress sufficient to bring this case within  the
    category of exceptional circumstances.  He  challenged  the  report  as
    exaggerating the children's concerns in the absence of medical evidence
    relating to either child.  The respondent was  not  willing  to  accept
    that the distress levels reach  that  stated  in  the  social  worker's
    report. He asserted that the  children's  evidence  was  likely  to  be
    instigated by the family to bolster the strength of the appeal.

12. As for the issue with the investor  application,  Mr  Melvin  described
    this as a near-miss case and that argument had been summarily  disposed
    of by the higher courts. Owing to the findings in Mansur, it would only
    be in a rare case where findings  by  a  professional  regulator  would
    affect the weight to be placed on the public interest.  The  appellants
    may have had bad advice  however,  the  Rules  were  not  met  and  the
    administrative review failed. In conclusion, Mr Melvin  submitted  that
    the appellants did not meet the Rules, there was a lack  of  danger  to
    the children or impact on  their  health,  development  or  welfare  or
    ability to reach their potential.

13. In reply, Mr Symes argued that there was a need for a true focus on the
    independent lives of  the  children.   The  statutory  guidance  had  a
    special force.  The  best  interest  duty  was  to  promote  a  child's
    development and optimum life chances. Furthermore, this was not a  near
    miss case but a negligence case. Referring to  GM  (Sri  Lanka)  [2019]
    EWCA 1630, Mr Symes emphasised the difference where a claimant was on a
    pathway to settled status. In  that  case  it  concerned  Discretionary
    Leave policy, whereas the appellants in  this  case  were  on  stronger
    ground.

14. At the end of the hearing, I reserved my decision.

Decision on remaking

15. The appellants have established private lives  in  the  United  Kingdom
    during the preceding six years plus. They entered  the  United  Kingdom
    with a view to settling under the Tier 1 (Investor) route. As stated in
    the adult appellants' witness statements, they sold  their  properties,
    vehicle and other valuables and ran down the first appellant's business
    prior to arriving in the United Kingdom lawfully.  The  application  to
    extend the appellants' leave under the same route failed owing to their
    failure to demonstrate that their specified investments had not  fallen
    below ï¿½750,000. This is rightly described by Mr Symes  as  a  technical
    failure, because the investments had not actually fallen below this sum
    at the relevant reporting period.  Indeed,  Mr  Melvin  did  not  argue
    otherwise. The appellants' financial advisors, (namely Anderson Ross, a
    representative of an FCA authorised and regulated firm)  in  answer  to
    the letter refusing administrative review, describe the  issue  in  the
    following way; "the value of our client's  qualifying  investments  had
    always remained above ï¿½750,000." That letter also states  that  at  the
    time of the  annual  report  dated  24  October  2014,  the  qualifying
    investments  were  valued  at  ï¿½751,504.51  and  together  with   other
    investments and a residential property, the  second  appellant's  total
    assets amounted to ï¿½1,028,570.43.  Lastly, Anderson Ross  explain  that
    the quarterly figures presented by the appellants' previous  solicitors
    were not reporting periods used by  the  financial  advisors  and  were
    therefore irrelevant.

16. Consequently, while the appellants did not meet the requirements of the
    Rules in  terms  of  being  able  to  demonstrate  that  the  specified
    investments were maintained, the second appellant  did  not  allow  her
    investments to fall below the required level at the reporting period.

17. It is not in contention that the appellants are, in addition, unable to
    meet the requirements of the Rules relating to family or private life.

18. Like their parents, the minor appellants, now aged 9 and 15  have  been
    residing in the United Kingdom since August 2013. I  therefore  examine
    the best interests of those children, as a primary consideration in the
    balancing exercise.  EJ1 completed primary school in the United Kingdom
    and  he  is  now  at  secondary  school,  studying  towards  his   GCSE
    examinations. EJ2 is in primary school and she  has  little  memory  of
    life in  Iran.  The  children  are  educated  in  English.  EJ1  speaks
    elementary level Farsi and EJ2 none at all. Both children  are  anxious
    about the prospect of returning to Iran. EJ2 associates Iran with death
    owing to recently losing three relatives. Furthermore, she  is  fearful
    of the cultural impact in relation to having to wear the veil  and  the
    fact that the family would be unable to conduct themselves as  they  do
    in the United Kingdom such as going swimming together.  EJ1 is  fearful
    in relation to military service which was linked to  his  uncle  taking
    his life. The second appellant  is  also  fearful  for  her  children's
    wellbeing and  that  of  the  family  in  relation  to  Islamic  social
    expectations of women in Iran. These fears  are  not  mere  assertions,
    they are supported by the expert evidence  of  the  independent  social
    worker in her report. In that report, the social worker  describes  the
    children's anxieties as being  acute,  to  the  extent  that  they  may
    interfere with their school, home and social life which could  threaten
    their ability to develop to their full potential. The current  position
    is that both children are described as  thriving  in  their  respective
    school environments.  The  expert  evidence  was  a  detailed  document
    compiled by an  experienced  professional  who  demonstrated  that  she
    understood that her principal duty was to the "court."  I  can  see  no
    reason to reject any aspect of the social worker's report  and  I  have
    placed significant weight upon it. I have taken into consideration  and
    accept Mr Melvin's  argument  that  the  appellants  are  comparatively
    wealthy and that this may mean they have more options available to them
    than the average Iranian family.

19. Having considered all the  relevant  circumstances,  I  find  that  the
    children's best interests are served by them remaining in the UK,  with
    their parents.  I am mindful that the best interests' assessment is not
    determinative of the appeal,  ZH  (Tanzania)  [2011]  UKSC  4  at  [26]
    considered.

20. Owing to section 117A (2) of Part 5A of the 2002  Act,  in  considering
    proportionality, I am obliged to  have  regard  to  the  considerations
    listed in section 117B and do so below.

21. The  public  interest  in  the  maintenance  of  effective  immigration
    controls is clearly engaged in this case.

22. I am mindful of the fact that the minor appellants are  not  qualifying
    children under section 117B  (6),  because  they  will  not  have  been
    present in the United Kingdom for 7 years until August 2020.

23. That the appellants speak fluent English is a  neutral  matter  in  the
    balancing  exercise.  As  is  the  fact  that  they   are   financially
    independent and are not likely to become a burden on taxpayers.

24. I have regard to the considerations at sections 117B  (5)  that  little
    weight should be given to the appellants'  private  lives,  which  were
    developed at a time when their immigration status was  precarious.  The
    appellants were granted limited leave to enter, which expired in  2016,
    following which they have pursued this human rights claim.

25. Notwithstanding the precariousness  of  their  leave,  considering  the
    misfortunes and errors which led the appellants to be  refused  further
    leave to remain despite having the required investments, I am  prepared
    to attach more weight to their private life than I otherwise would.  It
    is also relevant that it is not open to the  appellants  to  return  to
    Iran for the purpose of seeking entry clearance to return to the United
    Kingdom under the same route, as the minimum investment requirement has
    since doubled.

26. I am guided by  Kaur  (children's  best  interests  /  public  interest
    interface) [2017] UKUT 14 (IAC) where the Upper Tribunal concluded that
    the "little weight"  provisions  "do  not  entail  an  absolute,  rigid
    measurement or concept; "little  weight"  involves  a  spectrum  which,
    within its self-contained boundaries, will result in the measurement of
    the quantum of weight considered  appropriate  in  the  fact  sensitive
    context of every case." Furthermore,  Sales  LJ  observed  at  [53]  of
    Rhuppiah [2016] EWCA Civ 803; the "generalised normative  guidance  may
    be overridden in an exceptional case by particularly strong features of
    the private life in question, where it is not appropriate in Article  8
    terms to attach only little weight to private life." I find  that  this
    is such a case, the private and family life of  the  appellants  has  a
    special and compelling character in that it was established at  a  time
    when, they were entitled to expect to be  eligible  to  settle  in  the
    United Kingdom. Indeed, in GM (Sri Lanka), the following  was  held  in
    this regard; [34] "It follows that a person who could be said to be  on
    a pathway to settled status might, in relative terms, be in a  stronger
    position than one with DLR who was not  on  such  a  pathway  and  this
    relative position needs at least  to  be  taken  into  account  in  the
    proportionality, fair balance, assessment. "

27. The respondent's policy guidance, entitled "Family Life (as  a  partner
    or parent) and Private Life: 10 Year Routes"  updated  on  22  February
    2018, says the following; "Significant weight must be given to  such  a
    period of continuous residence. The longer the child has resided in the
    UK, and the older the age at which they have  done  so,  the  more  the
    balance will begin to shift towards it being unreasonable to expect the
    child to leave the UK, and strong reasons will be required in order  to
    refuse a case where the  outcome  will  be  removal  of  a  child  with
    continuous UK residence of seven years or more."  As  emphasised  above
    the  minor  appellants  are  not  qualifying  children,  however  their
    residence in the UK, the stage of EJ1's education and their  genuinely-
    held subjective fear of returning to Iran helps to  shift  the  balance
    towards it being unreasonable to expect them to leave the UK. The  only
    countervailing factor in this case is that none of the appellants  have
    leave to remain in the UK currently.

28. Having considered all the relevant matters in the round, including  the
    public interest considerations set out above, I am satisfied  that  the
    factors in support of the  appellants  remaining  in  the  UK  are  not
    outweighed by the countervailing considerations, outlined above. I find
    that the  appellants'  removal  would  result  in  unjustifiably  harsh
    consequences to  the  minor  appellants,  as  outlined  in  the  expert
    evidence.

29. I conclude that it would be a disproportionate breach of Article 8  for
    the appellants to be removed. Accordingly, this appeal  succeeds  under
    Article 8.





Notice of Decision

The appeal is allowed on human rights grounds.



Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs otherwise, the  appellants  are
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify them or any member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellants and to the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.



TO THE RESPONDENT

FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make no  fee  award
for the following reason. The appellants relied  on  expert  evidence  which
was not before the Secretary of State.

                            DECISION AND REASONS



Introduction

 1. This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Callow, promulgated on 14 May 2019.

 2. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Lindsley on  9
    July 2019.

Anonymity

 3. Such a direction was  made  previously  and  is  repeated  for  similar
    reasons.

Background

 4. The appellants are a family unit consisting  of  two  parents  and  two
    children currently aged 14 and 9. The appellants arrived in the  United
    Kingdom during 2013 with  leave  to  enter,  variously,  as  a  Tier  1
    (Investor) in the case of the second appellant, Tier 1 Investor partner
    and dependants. The appellants sought further leave to  remain  on  the
    same basis and were  refused.  Their  applications  for  administrative
    review of those decisions was unsuccessful as of 7 December 2016. On 21
    December 2016 the appellants applied  for  leave  to  remain  on  human
    rights grounds.

 5. The Secretary of State refused those applications in a letter dated  17
    January 2018 for the following reasons. Firstly, it was said  that  the
    applications fell  for  refusal  on  suitability  grounds  because  the
    respondent requested medical records which were  not  provided  by  the
    deadline of 25  September  2017.  Secondly,  the  applicants  were  all
    Iranian nationals, without leave to remain and who had resided  in  the
    United Kingdom for three years at the date  of  the  applications.  The
    respondent considered  whether  the  health  of  the  second  appellant
    amounted to exceptional circumstances but concluded  that  the  limited
    evidence of medical appointments provided did not show that the  second
    appellant's current medical condition would meet the high threshold for
    consideration under Article 3. Reference was also made  to  the  second
    appellant's care of  her  mother  who  was  ill  at  the  time  of  the
    application but subsequently died.

The hearing before the First-tier Tribunal

 6. At the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal, the  appellants  argued,
    inter alia, that their previous application for further leave to remain
    under  the  investor  route,  which  they  had  expected  to  lead   to
    settlement, had been derailed by poor advice. The Tribunal decided that
    no evidence was tendered to  support  the  appellants'  claim  of  poor
    advice or service in relation to their funds. In addition, it was found
    that it would not be unduly harsh for the minor appellants to return to
    Iran  with  their  parents  and  that  there  were  no  compelling   or
    exceptional circumstances.

The grounds of appeal

 7. The grounds of appeal were threefold. Firstly, it was  argued  that  in
    searching for very significant obstacles or  unduly  harsh  conditions,
    the judge had applied the wrong test for assessing the  best  interests
    of the children and proportionality. Secondly, it  was  contended  that
    the First-tier Tribunal had overlooked material evidence  contained  in
    the independent social worker's report as to the fears of the appellant
    children.  Thirdly,  it  was  argued  that  the   First-tier   Tribunal
    overlooked express material  evidence  of  professional  negligence  in
    relation to the reporting  period  used  in  the  previous  immigration
    application.

 8. Permission to appeal was granted on all grounds.

 9. The respondent's Rule 24 response, received on 18 July 2019,  indicated
    that the appeal was opposed and robustly defended the decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal

The hearing

10. Mr Symes reiterated what he had set out in the grounds. He argued  that
    the wrong threshold test had been applied regarding the  assessment  of
    the children,  in  that  the  judge  had  referred  to  both  the  very
    significant obstacles and the unduly harsh tests which did  not  apply.
    Furthermore, the judge had not assessed the evidence  relating  to  the
    children's objection to returning to Iran, as set out in an independent
    social worker's report.  As for  the  remaining  issue  concerning  the
    appellants' immigration history, Mr Symes argued  that  the  judge  was
    wrong treat the fact that there had been no complaint about the service
    of the previous immigration  advisors  as  decisive  of  the  issue  of
    whether they had been poorly advised.

11. Mr Melvin relied on the respondent's Rule 24  response.  He  emphasised
    that the appellants were  a  non-qualifying  family  under  the  Rules.
    Submitting that the appellants' case  was  set  out  from  [6]  of  the
    decision, he argued that the judge could not be accused of ignoring the
    evidence. In  finding  that  there  was  no  problem  with  the  family
    relocating to Iran where they had lived for many years before coming to
    the UK, the judge reached a holistic  view.  Mr  Melvin  conceded  that
    there  was  not  a  great  deal  of  consideration  of  the  children's
    circumstances but contended that even if it were in the best  interests
    of children to remain in the UK as a preference, the family could  face
    any problems together on return to Iran.  Conceding  further  that  the
    best interests of the children were not set out  in  the  decision,  he
    argued that there were no prospects of success,  so  any  error  was  a
    technical one.

12.  In  relation  to  the  appellants'  concerns  regarding  the  previous
    advisors, Mr Melvin argued that this  did  not  mean  that  the  appeal
    should succeed under Article 8, when the  investor  requirements  could
    not be met. He asked me to note that the judge had dealt with the  lack
    of a complaint and to uphold the decision.

13. In reply, Mr Symes argued that the judge missed out the  positive  case
    put regarding the children and assessed another case all  together,  in
    that all he had mentioned was their studies. As for the  other  ground,
    the judge had misinterpreted  Mansur  (immigration  adviser's  failing:
    Article 8) Bangladesh [2018] UKUT 00274 (IAC), in that it was  relevant
    whether a regulator made a finding but  it  was  not  decisive  of  the
    issue.

14. At the end of the hearing, I announced that I was  satisfied  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal made material errors of law and that  the  decision
    would be set aside in its entirety. My reasons are set out below.

Decision on error of law

15. The minor appellants put forward strong objections regarding  returning
    to Iran. These are set out in the  report  of  the  independent  social
    worker. Briefly, the third appellant was  concerned  about  his  mental
    state following the suicide of an uncle who was faced with the prospect
    of performing military service and the fourth appellant  had  a  strong
    aversion to the veil, aspects of Iranian  culture  and  fear  of  death
    following three recent bereavements. The social worker was sufficiently
    concerned regarding the third appellant that it  was  recommended  that
    the school be notified. There is no express assessment of this evidence
    in the decision and reasons. Indeed, all the judge mentions at [15]  is
    the children's schooling  and  a  vague  reference  to  the  children's
    "preferences." While the children were non-qualifying  owing  to  their
    length of residence, their best interests were entitled to be  afforded
    attention applying Jeunesse [2015] 60 EHRR.

16. In addition, the judge was wrong to look for very significant obstacles
    or to consider whether their circumstances were unduly  harsh.  Neither
    test was applicable here.

17. Regarding the immigration history point, the  application  for  further
    leave under  the  investor  route  required  the  second  appellant  to
    maintain  her  million-pound  investment.  The   previous   immigration
    advisors put in the wrong set of statements according to a letter  from
    Anderson Ross. The mistake was that  the  advisors  provided  quarterly
    reports whereas the reporting period was  annual,  the  latter  reports
    showing no dip in the investment amount. It is  acknowledged  that  the
    appellants have not made a complaint to a regulator.  Nonetheless,  the
    previous judge erred in dismissing this evidence owing to  the  absence
    of this complaint.  The  letter  from  Anderson  Ross  gives  a  strong
    indication  that  another  professional  had  failed,  that  they  were
    negligent and that this led to the  refusal  of  an  application  which
    would  otherwise  have  been  granted.  This   is   relevant   to   the
    consideration of the precariousness of the  appellants'  residence.  At
    [21], the judge makes the  following  finding  having  been  guided  by
    Mansur. "In the absence of an admission  of  guilt  and  a  finding  of
    culpability by a professional regulator or court,  the  maintenance  of
    effective immigration control  prevails."   This  is  a  misreading  of
    Mansur. While it is relevant whether a regulator has made a finding  of
    culpability, it is not decisive of the issue of the weight to be  place
    on the public interest.



Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error of on a point of law.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.

The appeal is to be remade following a hearing at Field House on a  date  to
be notified.



Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008
