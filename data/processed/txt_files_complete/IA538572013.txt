For the Appellant:     Mr Frederico Singarajan, Counsel.
For the Respondent:    Mr Ian Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This appeal is not subject to an  anonymity  order  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal pursuant to rule 13  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (First-tier
    Tribunal) (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Rules  2014.  Neither  party
    has invited me to make an anonymity order pursuant to rule  14  of  the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  (SI  2008/2698)  and  I
    have not done so.

 2. The appellant appeals against the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge Handley) dismissing the appellant's appeal  against  a  decision
    taken on 18 December 2013 to refuse the  appellant's  application  made
    under the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006 ("the Regulations") for  a
    residence card.

Introduction

 3. The appellant is in a relationship  with  Mr  Roman  Slavik  who  is  a
    citizen of Slovakia ("the EEA Sponsor"). He claims to  work  as  a  car
    salesman for his uncle since 1 August 2014 ("the  current  employment")
    but has irregular hours. He has also worked for 11  different  agencies
    for the past 9 years, as evidenced by his HMRC records since 2007.

 4. The Secretary of State concluded that the evidence submitted  with  the
    application (3 contracts of employment, an employee handbook  from  PMP
    Recruitment, a P45 and tax code documents) was not sufficient  to  show
    that the EEA sponsor was a qualified person exercising treaty rights in
    the UK.

The Appeal

 5. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal and attended an  oral
    hearing at Richmond on 4 November 2014. She was  represented  by  Mr  M
    Sowerby, Counsel. The  EEA  sponsor  did  not  attend.  The  First-tier
    Tribunal found that the  current  employment  post-dated  the  date  of
    decision and that the EEA sponsor had provided little information about
    the dates he had worked for his previous employers and about the length
    of his employment with them.

 6. The judge found that a number of documents in relation to  the  current
    employment gave cause for concern  and  took  into  account  a  witness
    statement from a HMRC officer who  stated  that  the  EEA  sponsor  was
    employed by Interecruit GB Ltd during 2013-2014 and paid 99p  tax.  The
    judge had seen a contract with PMP  Recruitment  and  the  EEA  sponsor
    signed on 4 July 2013 but the HMRC witness statement made no mention of
    that employment. No current employer was shown for 2014-2015.  The  P45
    submitted by the appellant showed that the PMP  Recruitment  employment
    ended on 4 January 2013.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

 7. The appellant sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal  on  13
    February 2015 on the basis that the First-tier Tribunal  had  erred  in
    law. The HMRC witness statement failed to consider  that  tax  is  only
    paid above  a  certain  income  level.  The  EEA  sponsor  subsequently
    obtained HMRC records from 2007 and those records show a  total  income
    of �1571.41 from Interecruit GB Ltd for 2012-2013 and �97.92  from  PMP
    Recruitment Ltd. Further information was also submitted in relation  to
    the current employment.

 8. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge  Reeds  on  18
    May 2015. Evidence had been produced which showed that it was  arguable
    that the information in the HMRC witness statement  was  not  accurate.
    That evidence was not before the judge but it  was  arguable  that  the
    judge proceeded on a mistake of fact by relying on information from  an
    official source when that information was not wholly accurate.

 9. Thus, the appeal came before me

Discussion

10. Mr Singarajan submitted that the relevant date was the date of hearing.
    The HMRC witness statement has never been disclosed  to  the  appellant
    and it is not clear why it was  not  served  on  counsel  at  the  oral
    hearing. The HMRC  witness  statement  was  sparse  regarding  the  EEA
    sponsor's employment history. The appellant's bundle  shows  continuous
    employment from 2008-2014. Mr Singarajan relied upon paragraphs 7,  14,
    15 and 16 of  MM  (unfairness)  Sudan  [2014]  UKUT  00105  (IAC).  The
    information from HMRC that was damaging to the appellant's case was not
    disclosed before the oral hearing. The judge was not at fault  but  the
    error of fact led to a material error of law.  The  employment  history
    was fundamental to the appeal.

11. Mr Jarvis submitted that  the  new  evidence  should  be  treated  with
    caution. The appellant could have brought evidence to the oral  hearing
    and there was no request for an adjournment. MM was an asylum decision.
    There was no material error here.  The  appellant  was  represented  by
    experienced counsel and  the  EEA  sponsor  did  not  attend  the  oral
    hearing. The appeal had already been adjourned from 23 July 2014 on the
    basis of the respondent's desire to  conduct  a  HMRC  check.  The  new
    evidence could have been  supplied  at  the  oral  hearing.  There  was
    nothing to prevent the appellant from making a valid fresh application.

12. Mr Singarajan replied that the judge  thought  that  the  HMRC  witness
    statement was a full employment history but it clearly was  not.  There
    was no opportunity for the appellant to test the accuracy of  the  HMRC
    witness statement. The judge gave significant weight to that  evidence.
    There was no requirement for the appellant to submit HMRC  evidence  in
    relation to a speculative and hypothetical issue that might  be  raised
    by the respondent. The payslips  and  employment  contracts  should  be
    enough. There was no reason for the appellant to believe that the  HMRC
    witness statement produced at the oral hearing would be incomplete.

13. I have seen a letter dated 8 January 2015 from HMRC which sets out  the
    EEA sponsor's earnings and tax/national insurance  paid  for  each  tax
    year from 2007-2014. The letter shows earnings as set out in  paragraph
    7 above for 2012-2013 as well as �4298.35 from Servest  Group  Ltd  and
    �917 from TC Facilities Management Ltd. For 2013-2014, the letter shows
    earnings of �532.65 from Ecoclean Services Ltd.  The  letter  obviously
    contradicts the findings set out at paragraph 6 above  based  upon  the
    HMRC witness statement. There is a conflict within  the  HMRC  evidence
    and the HMRC witness statement does not appear to be a reliable  source
    of evidence.

14. I have considered MM.  That  was  an  asylum  case  but  the  governing
    principles set out at paragraph 14 to 23 are not restricted  to  asylum
    cases. I am satisfied that the judge made a mistake as to existing fact
    (the employment record of the EEA sponsor) which has led to unfairness.
    The letter dated 8 January 2015 sets out  established  facts  regarding
    the EEA sponsor's employment record. The appellant was not  responsible
    for the mistake because the HMRC witness statement was not included  in
    the respondent's bundle and was not served  on  the  appellant  at  any
    time. There was no opportunity  to  test  or  contradict  the  evidence
    before or during the oral hearing. The EEA sponsor was not present  and
    the appellant had no available evidence to rebut the  evidence  in  the
    HMRC witness statement. The mistake clearly played a material  part  in
    the judge's reasoning. I accept Mr Singarajan's submission that it  was
    reasonable for  the  appellant  to  rely  on  the  employment  evidence
    contained within the appellant's bundle and to assume that any evidence
    obtained from HMRC by the respondent would be accurate.

15. Thus, the First-tier Tribunal's decision  to  dismiss  the  appellant's
    appeal under the EEA regulations involved the making of an error of law
    and its decision cannot stand. The judge was not at fault in  any  way.
    This is a straightforward factual issue and the respondent may be  able
    to determine the issue by  resolving  the  conflicts  within  the  HMRC
    evidence without the need for a further hearing.

Decision

16. Both representatives invited me to order a rehearing in the  First-tier
    Tribunal if I set aside the judge's decision. Bearing in mind paragraph
    7.2 of the Senior President's Practice Statements I  consider  that  an
    appropriate course of action. I find that the error of law infects  the
    decision as a whole and therefore the re-hearing will be de  novo  with
    all issues to be considered again by the First-tier Tribunal.

17. Consequently, I set aside the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal.  I
    order the appeal to be heard again in the  First-Tier  Tribunal  to  be
    determined de novo by a judge other than the previous First-tier judge.
