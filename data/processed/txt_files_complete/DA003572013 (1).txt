Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr P Lewis, Counsel instructed by Kidd Rapinet

For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   This is the appeal of Mr J.A.R.M., a citizen of Colombia, who was  born
    on [ ] 1973.  He entered the country on 13th August, 1987 to  join  his
    mother.  In 2003 he made an application for  leave  to  remain  on  the
    basis of his marriage to a person present and  settled  here  and  that
    application was subsequently rejected on 4th April,  2003.   A  further
    application was made on the basis of his long residence  and  that  was
    recorded as being void and an  application  made  on  30th  July,  2003
    concerning his leave to remain on  the  basis  of  marriage  apparently
    remains outstanding.

2.   On 20th April, 2003 the appellant pleaded guilty at  Snaresbrook  Crown
    Court to being involved in the importation of 35.8  kilos  of  class  A
    drugs with a street value of ï¿½2,500,000.  He was sentenced on 30th June
    to a total of thirteen years' imprisonment.

3.   He claimed asylum on 28th April, 2008 and repeated that claim in  2009.



4.   It was in March 2010 that the Border Agency  contacted  him  concerning
    his liability to automatic deportation under the provisions of  Section
    32 of the UK Borders Act, 2007.  On 25th October, 2010, the  UK  Border
    Agency again wrote to the appellant and suggested that  his  conviction
    was for a particularly serious crime and that he was  deemed  therefore
    to constitute a danger to the community in the United Kingdom and  fell
    for exclusion from protection  of  the  1951  Refugee  Convention.   No
    representations made in rebuttal were made.

5.   The asylum claim was refused by the respondent on  5th  February,  2013
    and the appellant appealed.  His appeal was  heard  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal on 11th February and on 8th June, 2013.

6.   The hearing on 11th February proceeded  with  evidence  from  a  police
    officer and at the adjourned hearing on 8th June, it was intended  that
    the appellant should give evidence.  However, he was ill and produced a
    letter in the form of a report from his  general  medical  practitioner
    which said,

         "this patient is suffering from depression.  He is  currently  not
         fit to work.  He is also currently not fit to attend court to  give
         evidence".

7.   The judge seems to have been concerned by  what  his  Designated  Judge
    had said in refusing the adjournment, namely that there was no credible
    explanation as to why, whatever depression the appellant suffers  from,
    is such as to  make  him  unfit  to  attend  court  to  give  evidence.
    However, the judge had before him a medical report signed by  a  doctor
    who had expressed the view that the appellant was  not  fit  to  attend
    court to give evidence.  That, as far as the judge is concerned, should
    have been sufficient for him  to  adjourn  the  hearing.   Instead,  he
    proceeded with the hearing in the absence of  the  appellant,  thereby,
    denying him the right to a fair hearing.  Mr Avery suggested  that  the
    stance of the judge was justified because of the brevity of the report.
     I am afraid I disagree.  The Tribunal has given huge amounts of advice
    concerning the care with which judges  should  pay  attention  to,  and
    consider medical reports.  The letter, brief though it was, was still a
    view expressed by a medical professional who had examined the appellant
    and should have been respected.  The  one  person  who  ought  to  know
    whether or not an appellant is fit to attend the  hearing  is  his  own
    general medical practitioner.

8.   In all the circumstances I conclude that the judge did  err  and  erred
    to the extent that he denied the appellant a fair hearing.  As a result
    I remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal for a hearing afresh by a
    judge  other  than  First-tier  Tribunal   Judge   Cockrill.    Neither
    representative was opposed to that course of  action.   An  interpreter
    will not be required but, given the fact that this required  two  days'
    hearing previously, I suggest that two days should be allowed  for  the
    hearing at the adjourned hearing.
