Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr E Mohanugo, Legal Representative, Moorhouse
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr P Nath, Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant has permission to challenge the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Boyes sent on 28 September  2016.   The  basis  of  that
    decision was that the appellant had no  right  of  appeal  because  the
    decision  made  by  the  respondent  dated  1  July  2014  was  not  an
    immigration decision under Section 82(2)(d)  of  the  NIAA  2002.   The
    judge stated that "for there to be an 'immigration  decision'  for  the
    appellant to appeal against, she must have had leave at the  date  when
    she made a valid application" (paragraph 23).  Earlier  the  judge  had
    found that:

         "16. The application submitted on the 19 February 2014 was made  on
             form FLR(O)  version  12/2013.   The  Respondent  acknowledged
             receipt of the application by letter on the 20 February  2014.


         17.  The Respondent then wrote to the Appellant  on  the  31  March
             2014 to inform her that she should  have  used  form  FLR(FP).
             She was told that in order to comply with paragraph A34 to 34D
             of the Immigration that she had to submit the new form  within
             7 calendar days of the date of the  letter,  that  no  further
             extension of time would be given and that if the form  is  not
             provided within the 7 day timeframe that the application would
             be rejected as invalid.


         18.   I  accept  and  find  as  a   fact   that   the   Appellant's
             representatives received the letter of the 31  March  2014  on
             the 4 April 2014.  It is not unusual for  letters  from  large
             organisations such as the Home Office not to be  posted  until
             several days after they  are  written.   Alternatively  it  is
             possible that it was delayed within  the  postal  system.   In
             this case I accept that the letter was not received until  the
             4 April 2014, which was a  Friday,  and  that  practically  it
             would have been difficult for the Appellant to  comply  within
             the timescale provided by the Respondent.


         19.  Whilst the covering letter from the representatives sent  with
             the re-submitted form is dated the 7 April  2014,  it  can  be
             seen from the postmark on the envelope that the  correct  form
             was posted to the Respondent by special next day  delivery  on
             the 8 April 2014.  It is therefore clear from  the  chronology
             that the Appellant and her representative acting  promptly  on
             receipt of the letter from the Respondent  and  forwarded  the
             correct  form  as  quickly  as  could  reasonably  have   been
             expected.  However, the application was not re-submitted until
             the 8 April 2014, one  day  after  the  deadline  set  by  the
             Respondent".


2.   In granting permission UTJ Smith sated at paragraphs 5 and 6:

         "5.  There is though an arguable error which is obvious on the face
             of the Decision.  That relates to  the  terms  of  the  letter
             dated 31 March 2014.  That letter provides  that  the  correct
             application needed to be sent 'within 7 calendar days of  this
             notification'  (my  emphasis).   The  Judge  at  [17]  of  the
             Decision  refers  to  that  requirement  as  being  'within  7
             calendar days of the date of the letter'.  That arguably makes
             a difference.  At [24] of the Decision,  the  Judge  sets  out
             paragraph 34C of the Rules as that existed at the  time  which
             makes clear that notice of invalidity is deemed to be received
             'on the second day  after  it  was  posted'  where  notice  of
             validity is given by post.  In this case, that would mean that
             notification was not until 2 April 2014 with the  consequence,
             if that is correct, that the rectified  application  was  made
             within seven days as it was posted by next day delivery  on  8
             April 2014.


         6.   If the rectified application were  received  in  time,  it  is
             arguable that the Appellant continued to have section 3C leave
             by virtue of the rectified application.  The application  made
             on 2 May 2014 would be a variation of that application and the
             Appellant's leave would continue to be extended until the date
             of the refusal on 1 July 2014.  If that  is  right,  then  the
             Appellant did  have  continuing  leave  at  the  date  of  the
             Respondent's decision under appeal and  her  appeal  would  be
             valid".


3.   After discussion between the parties Mr Nath agreed  that  UTJ  Smith's
    analysis was correct.  It is unnecessary for me to say anything further
    than that paragraph 34C states that an  application  will  be  declared
    invalid "... where it is sent by post, in which case it will be  deemed
    to be received on the second day after it was posted excluding any  day
    which is not a business day".  Had  the  judge  properly  analysed  the
    facts he would have found that the  appellant's  rectified  application
    sent on 8 April 2014 was valid.  (The judge had clearly  accepted  that
    the appellant's representatives did  not  receive  the  31  March  2014
    letter until 4 April 2014: see paragraph 18).  Mr Nath agreed  that  if
    the application was valid, the appellant  had  continuing  leave  under
    Section 3C of the 1971 Act. I find that it was valid.

4.   Accordingly the FtT Judge materially erred in law and his  decision  is
    set aside.

5.   The case is remitted to be heard by the FtT (not before Judge Boyes).

No anonymity direction is made.
