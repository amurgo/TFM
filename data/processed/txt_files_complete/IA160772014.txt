                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS
Introduction


 1. The Appellant, a female citizen of India, applied for leave  to  remain
    as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant pursuant to paragraph 245DD of HC
    395, as amended (the Immigration Rules). Her  application  was  refused
    under paragraph 245DD(b) because  with  her  application  she  did  not
    provide the documentary evidence specified in paragraph 41-SD(d)(ii) of
    Appendix A, despite requests from the Respondent on 24 February 2014 by
    email and on 5 March 2014 by letter to her  representatives.  She  sent
    the information requested by special delivery letter on 18  March  2014
    and it was received by the Respondent on 19 March 2014. The decision on
    her application was issued on 20 March 2014.  Her  appeal  against  the
    decision to refuse to vary her leave to remain was dismissed by  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Harries (the Judge), who found  that  she  had  not
    complied with the terms of the request for information.


 2. The nub of the Appellant's grounds of application  is  that  the  Judge
    erred in: (i) failing to properly consider the facts as set out in  the
    documentary evidence before him and to give sufficient weight to it (in
    relation to the receipt of the additional evidence and  as  to  Article
    8); (ii) finding that the Respondent had not  received  the  additional
    documents within the given time of 7 working days bearing in mind  that
    there was no evidence tendered by the Respondent as to date of  posting
    and it was served on the Appellant on 11 March 2014; (iii)  failing  to
    apply the principle of fairness as provided in Thakur (PBS  decision  -
    common law fairness (Bangladesh)  [2011]  UKUT  00151.  It  is  further
    submitted "reliance is placed on Article 8 ECHR".


 3. Permission was granted because it was arguable that the Tribunal  erred
    in law in holding that the Respondent was not obliged to  consider  the
    further documents, which she herself had requested from  the  Appellant
    and which she received (as the Tribunal appeared to have  accepted)  on
    the day before the date on which she decided to refuse the  application
    [17].

 4. The Respondent submitted a Rule 24 response asserting  that  the  Judge
    made a sustainable finding at [17] that "The Appellant was  obliged  to
    submit further information within 7 working days from the date  of  the
    letter which was 5 March 2014. She therefore  had  the  flexibility  to
    submit information until 17 March at the very latest. Her  evidence  is
    that she sent the additional evidence on  18  March  2014  and  it  was
    received on 19 March 2014. In these circumstances I do not accept  that
    the information had to be  considered  by  the  Respondent  before  the
    refusal on 20 March 2014. I am not entitled to take account of evidence
    not submitted with the application and there was no obligation  on  the
    Respondent to exercise discretion."


 5. Mr Adophy submitted that:

      a. Although the grounds of application were  lengthy,  they  could  be
         summarised  as  follows:   The  evidence  was  requested   by   the
         Respondent on 5 March 2014. The Appellant sent it on 18 March 2014,
         the Respondent received it on 19 March 2014 and issued the decision
         on 20 March 2014. The question was therefore  whether  having  made
         the request for documentary evidence, the Respondent  was  entitled
         to ignore the evidence submitted in compliance  with  the  request.
         The letter of 5 March 2014  was  date  stamped  'received'  by  the
         Appellant's representative on 11 March 2014. That was the date when
         the request came to their knowledge. The letter of 5 March 2014, at
         p2 of 3, paragraph 2, required the evidence to  be  sent  within  7
         working days of the request. This period of time would start to run
         when the Appellant has knowledge of the request. This was  not  the
         view taken by the Judge who stated at [17]  "....I  do  not  accept
         that the timescale of 7 working days from the second request  in  a
         letter can correctly be interpreted  as  being  from  the  date  of
         receipt by the Appellant, particularly when the  letter  was  first
         sent to her representative." In so deciding, Mr Adophy argued  that
         the Judge erred because this interpretation does  not  follow  from
         the terms of the letter. The  Tribunal  inserted  additional  words
         into the letter of 5 March 2014 in stating that time must run  from
         the date of the letter.


      b. If the Respondent intended to rely  on  the  presumption  that  the
         letter would be received on the day after posting,  then  proof  of
         posting would need to be provided.  The date of the letter  is  not
         the date of posting and no evidence of  the  date  of  posting  was
         provided. If it was posted on 5 March  2014,  and  it  is  not  the
         practice of the Home Office to post letters on the same date as the
         date on the letter, it would have arrived on 7 March 2014. As  this
         was a Friday, time would begin to run from Monday 10 March 2012 and
         would end  on  18  March  2014.  The  date  on  which  the  further
         information would have been received by the Respondent would be  18
         March 2014, relying on the  provisions  of  paragraph  34G  of  the
         Immigration Rules which provides that an application made  by  post
         is deemed to be made on the date on which it is posted.  Therefore,
         the Appellant supplied the information within 7 working days of the
         request. This was based on the  assumption  that  the  request  was
         posted on 5 March 2014 and there was no need to disregard the 'date
         received' stamp on the letter received by her representatives.  The
         information was therefore received in time  and  should  have  been
         considered by the Respondent.


      c. The Respondent would not have requested the evidence if it had  not
         been clear that leave would be granted if  evidence  was  supplied.
         Therefore there was no reason why the Appellant's appeal should not
         be allowed. He submitted that  the  Judge  had  clearly  materially
         erred in law.


 6. Mr Avery submitted, and I agreed, that the provisions of paragraph  34G
    of  the  Immigration  Rules  related  to  the  date   of   receipt   of
    applications.  The  relevant  Immigration  Rule  for  the  purposes  of
    requests for additional evidence was 245AA  which  provides  that  "The
    requested documents must be received at the address  specified  in  the
    request within 7 working days of the date of the request." The  request
    was made on 5 March 2014 and the Appellant did not provide the evidence
    within 7 working days of the request; paragraph  245AA  did  not  state
    that the requested documents must be provided within 7 working days  of
    the date of receipt of the request. Had the Secretary of  State  wished
    to make that provision, it  would  have  been  specified  in  paragraph
    245AA. It was therefore open to the Judge to find  that  the  Appellant
    did not supply the evidence within the timescale set by the Rules.

 7. I asked Mr Avery whether, if the Appellant put the evidence  in  before
    the date  of  decision  but  not  within  the  timescale  envisaged  by
    paragraph 245AA, the Respondent was obliged to consider  evidence  that
    she had before the decision was made. He stated that the Respondent had
    in fact requested information on 24 February 2014 and it had  not  been
    supplied. The documentary evidence did not  reach  the  decision  maker
    before the decision was made.

 8. In response,  Mr  Adophy  submitted  that  he  stood  by  his  previous
    submissions. He submitted  that  a  further  point  of  fairness  arose
    because the Respondent had initiated the request and then had failed to
    consider evidence that was provided in compliance with that request. Mr
    Avery submitted that no unfairness arose;  the  Respondent  had  merely
    behaved in the way that she said she would.  The  documentary  evidence
    was not provided within 7 working days of the request.

 9. Although Mr Adophy submitted that if I found that there was a  material
    error, I should go on to  remake  the  decision  to  allow  the  appeal
    because the Respondent would not  have  requested  the  information  if
    supply of it would not have resulted in leave being granted, I  pointed
    out that the  Respondent  had  in  fact  stated  in  the  RL  that  the
    application  had  not  been  finally  assessed  because  the  requested
    documentary evidence had not been provided. Mr Adophy accepted that the
    only course of action would be to  allow  the  appeal  to  the  limited
    extent that it was not in accordance with the law.

Analysis and reasons

10. Mr Adophy did not in fact  refer  to  Article  8  in  his  submissions.
    Article 8 was not raised before the First-tier Tribunal and it was  not
    an error of law for the Judge not to deal with grounds which  were  not
    raised before him.


11. As to the submissions based on paragraph 245AA, this provision requires
    evidence to be received by the Respondent within 7 days of the date  of
    request, not from the date on which the request  was  received  by  the
    Appellant.  The  Judge  was  therefore  correct  in  stating  that  the
    information should have been received by the  Respondent  on  17  March
    2014 [17]. I do not agree with Mr Adophy that words should be added  to
    the Immigration Rules to  require  the  evidence  to  be  sent  to  the
    Respondent within 7 days of the receipt of the request.


12. However, where evidence  is  provided  to  the  Respondent  before  the
    decision is issued, the Respondent has a continuing duty to assess  the
    information that has been provided in support of the application up  to
    the date of decision (Nasim  others  (Raju:  reasons  not  to  follow?)
    [2013] UKUT 610, head note (4)).


13. In the Appellant's case, the evidence was supplied prior to the date of
    decision and was not considered. In the  circumstances  the  Judge  was
    wrong to hold that the Respondent  was  not  obliged  to  consider  the
    documents which had been provided prior to the date of decision.

14. I therefore allow this appeal to the limited extent that  the  decision
    is not in accordance with the law and it remains with the Respondent to
    make a decision on the Appellant's application on the basis of all  the
    information provided prior to the date of decision.

Decision

15. The determination of Judge Harries contains a material  error  of  law.
    His decision is set aside. I remake the decision to allow the appeal to
    the limited extent that it is not  in  accordance  with  the  law.  The
    Appellant's application remains with the Respondent to  make  a  lawful
    decision.

Anonymity


16. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule  45(4)(i)
   of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005 and  I  see
   no reason why an order should be made pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal
   Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

I have considered whether to make a fee award. I have had regard to the
Joint Presidential Guidance Note: Fee Awards in Immigration Appeals
(December 2011). As the Appellant's appeal has been allowed, I make a fee
award of �140.00.
