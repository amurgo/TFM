Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr E, Fripp, Counsel instructed by M & K Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr L. Tarlow, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is a citizen of Albania born on 24 January 1995.  She is
      appealing, with permission, against the decision of First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Khan promulgated on 4 October 2016 to dismiss her
      appeal against a decision by the respondent to refuse her human rights
      claim.


   2. The appellant's case, in summary, is that she fled Albania because of
      a violent ex-boyfriend and entered the UK clandestinely on 23 May
      2014. She then entered into a relationship with a British citizen she
      had been friends with on Facebook and they married on 26 March 2015.
      The appellant maintains that her husband has two young children from a
      previous marriage with whom he is in regular contact and therefore he
      could not realistically move to Albania with her. She also claims that
      her husband is in employment, earning in the region of ï¿½2,500.


   3. The respondent rejected the appellant's human rights application on
      the basis that she was not in a genuine and subsisting marriage. The
      letter refusing the appellant's application, dated 2 September 2015,
      refers to a marriage interview where there was a total of eleven
      discrepancies. Regarding her husband's children, the respondent stated
      that there was little information regarding her husband's contact with
      them.


   4. The appellant appealed and the appeal came before Judge Khan. The
      respondent was not represented at the hearing. The judge heard oral
      evidence from the appellant, her husband, and a friend of her husband
      Mr Fikaj.


   5. The judge did not find the appellant credible. His findings on
      credibility are set out in paragraph 27- 30.


   a) At paragraph 27 the judge stated that the appellant's evidence was
      that she had known her husband, over the internet, since November 2013
      and had met with him as soon as she entered the UK in May 2014, but
      that she claimed he did not know about her travel to the UK. The judge
      found that it was not credible for her husband to not know about her
      travelling to the UK.


   b) At paragraph 28 the judge stated that the appellant does not know how
      much contact her husband has with his children. He described her
      evidence on this point as "vague and evasive" and stated that he did
      "not find it credible that the appellant does not know when and how
      much contact her husband has with his two children."


   c) At paragraph 29 the judge stated that the appellant said she has one
      real brother and two step brothers and her husband said she had two
      brothers. He then stated that if the appellant and her husband were in
      a genuine relationship they would know more about each other. He
      concluded: "I find that these evidential issues go to the heart of the
      appellant's credibility."


   d) At paragraph 30 the judge stated:


             "The evidence of Mr Fikaj does not assist me in this matter as
             the appellant and her husband's evidence is contradictory and
             inconsistent. The appellant's oral evidence is vague, evasive
             and lacking in truth".


   6. The judge noted that the respondent had failed to produce the
      interview with the appellant to substantiate the alleged
      inconsistencies. At paragraph 34 the judge stated that he would not
      take into account the respondent's allegations because of the failure
      to provide evidence.


   7. The judge then directed himself to consider the appeal under Article 8
      ECHR and to have regard to Section 117A and B of the Nationality,
      Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 ("the 2002 Act").


   8. The evaluation of Section 117A and B is brief, and is set out at
      paragraphs 38 - 40.


   a) At paragraph 38 the judge stated that little weight should be given to
      a private life when a person's immigration status is precarious and
      that "the appellant in this case had limited leave to remain in the UK
      as a visitor".


   b) At paragraph 39 the judge set out an extract from AM (S117B) Malawi
      [2015] UKUT 0260 (IAC).


   c) At paragraph 40 the judge stated: "the whole of the appellant's time
      spent in the UK is in the knowledge that they [sic] have no right to
      settle here. I see no reason as to why her daughter could not return
      to Nigeria with her mother and resettle in the country of their
      origin."


Grounds of appeal and submissions


   9. The grounds argue, firstly, that the decision of the First-tier
      Tribunal is characterised by a general absence of scrutiny, where, for
      example, the wrong country (Nigeria) is referred to.


  10. The grounds also argue that the judge failed to take into account
      material evidence, in particular the detailed evidence of Mr Fikaj,
      who described, inter alia, the appellant and her husband's wedding,
      attending their home for dinner parties, being aware of them sleeping
      in the same room (and overhearing them having sex), and being the best
      man at the wedding.


  11. The grounds challenge the credibility findings. A key point taken
      against the appellant was that she did not know how much contact her
      husband had with his children. The grounds argue that this is
      misconceived as the evidence of the appellant and her husband, as
      recorded in the decision, was not inconsistent.


  12. A further argument is made that there was no rational basis to infer
      lack of credibility from a suspicion that the appellant's husband was
      aware of her intention to enter the UK in 2013.


  13. Before me, Mr Fripp argued that the judge has failed to address
      several issues that were material to the appeal, including in
      particular the children of the appellant's husband and appellant's
      fear of her former partner in Albania. He also argued that the judge
      did not have a basis for his sweeping rejection of the appellant's
      case and that the decision did not include a sustainable body of
      reasons.


  14. Mr Tarlow argued that the judge, at paragraphs 27 - 29 made findings
      that were open to him which were relevant to the appellant's
      credibility and was entitled to find her not credible. He maintained
      that it was not a material error to find Mr Fikaj's evidence of no
      assistance given the discrepancies.



Consideration


  15. The judge has made three material errors of law.


  16. The first error concerns the assessment of the appellant's
      credibility.


  17. A reason given by the judge for not finding the appellant credible was
      that the appellant did not know how often her husband saw his
      children. However, the evidence, as recounted by the judge in the
      decision, does not in fact support this conclusion.


  18. At paragraph 19 the judge summarised the oral evidence of the
      appellant, stating:


         "in reply to the Immigration Judge, the appellant said that her
         husband's children live with there [sic] maternal grandparents and
         her husband has contact with his children, he can pick them up at
         any time (vague and evasive). She said that they spend most of
         their holidays with him and he sees them at weekends, she and he
         travel to the children, more than an hour away. She said that she
         and her husband see the children at the weekend as they are at
         school during the week, they spend more time with them during
         school holidays."

  19. At paragraph 22 the judge summarised the oral evidence he heard from
      the appellant's husband. In respect of visits to the children, the
      judge stated:


         "He said that he sees his children once a month, he picks them up
         for a weekend..."

  20. There is no clear inconsistency or contradiction between the evidence
      of the appellant and her husband. Both are saying that the appellant's
      husband sees the children on weekends. Neither are saying that they
      see them every weekend. The difference in the use of language in
      describing the weekend visits to the husband's children is not a basis
      for the conclusion reached by the judge that the appellant "did not
      know when and how much contact her husband has with his two children".


  21. I am satisfied that this error regarding visits to the children was
      material to the credibility assessment, and therefore to the outcome.
      In assessing her credibility, the judge found only three factors
      weighing against the appellant. These are set out in paragraphs 27 to
      29 of the decision and are summarised above in paragraph 5. Once one
      of these is removed, it is not clear how the judge would have balanced
      the other two findings against the appellant with the other evidence
      before him (such as the statement of Mr Fikaj and documentary
      evidence) that was supportive of her.


  22. A second material error arises from the approach taken to Mr Fikaj's
      evidence. In cases where credibility is in issue, the fact that
      someone's account is corroborated by that of another witness can add
      to its credibility. Mr Fikaj's evidence was therefore relevant and it
      was an error to treat it as not and to completely disregard it.


  23. A third material error arises from the judge's application of Section
      117B of the 2002 Act to the appellant. At paragraph 38 the judge
      referred to the appellant having limited to leave to remain in the UK
      as a visitor. However, she entered the UK unlawfully and has never
      been in the UK as a visitor. At paragraph 40 the judge stated that
      there is no reason the appellant's daughter could not return to
      Nigeria. The appellant does not have a daughter and has no connection
      to Nigeria. Whilst I would not find a material error arose from a mere
      slip, it is not possible to discern from paragraphs 38 - 40 the
      judge's reasons for finding Article 8 would not be infringed by
      removing the appellant from the UK as the analysis appears to relate
      to a different person.


  24. Both parties were of the view that the matter should be remitted to
      the First-tier Tribunal. I agree. As the error of law relates to the
      assessment of credibility, a full rehearing of all the evidence will
      be necessary.


Decision

25. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains a material error of
   law such that it should be set aside in its entirety and the appeal heard
   afresh.

26. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for hearing afresh
   before a judge other than First-tier Tribunal Judge Khan.
