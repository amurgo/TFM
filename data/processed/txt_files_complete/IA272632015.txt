                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

    1. The appellant is a national of Thailand who came to the United
       Kingdom with her husband, a British national, on 25 September 2014.
       She entered on a visit visa valid until 31 January 2015, subsequently
       extended to 25 March 2015.

    2. On 25 March 2015 she applied for further leave to remain on the basis
       of article 8 rights. On 6 July 2015 she gave birth to their son,
       Carter. He is entitled to British nationality through his father.

    3. Her application was dismissed on 20 July 2015. The reasons for
       refusal letter indicated that her situation had been considered under
       appendix FM of the immigration rules under the partner and parent
       route. She was in the United Kingdom with leave as a visitor so
       failed to meet the eligibility requirements and consequently EX.I was
       not considered. Furthermore, she did not have sole parental
       responsibility for her child.

    4. Her application did not succeed under paragraph 276 ADE in respect to
       her private life as she had been in the country only a short time.
       There was no reason why she could not reintegrate into Thailand.

    5. The respondent went on to consider any exceptional circumstances
       consistent with the appellant article 8 rights which might warrant a
       grant of leave and found none.

The First-tier tribunal

    6. Her appeal was heard on 15 February 2016 before Judge of the First-
       tier Tribunal Cope. The grounds of appeal were limited to
       consideration of her article 8 rights outside the rules. The judge
       referred to the decision of Mostafa (Egypt) [2015] UKUT 00112 et al
       and concluded that the appellant's ability to meet the relevant
       immigration rules whilst not determinative was relevant to the
       proportionality of the decision.

    7. At paragraph 60 onwards the judge considered her husband's employment
       against the benchmark of the financial provisions in the immigration
       rules. Her husband had indicated that since returning to the United
       Kingdom he had been in employment. The judge did not accept the
       claimed earnings. A P45 indicated that until leaving an employment on
       18 May 2015 he had received �4476 gross. From this the judge
       concluded he had earned an average of �1278 for the three a half
       months he had been employed. At paragraph 17 the judge referred to
       payslips for different employment from July 2015. The judge referred
       to these as showing earnings of between �350 and �450 gross per
       month. At paragraph 72 the judge referred to the lack of proofs and
       concluded that her husband did not have an income approaching the
       financial requirements under the rules.

    8. In considering proportionality at paragraph 97 onwards the judge
       refers to the amendment of the 2002 Act by section 117 A and B and
       the statutory presumption that the maintenance of effective
       immigration control is in the public interest. The judge at paragraph
       120 referred to the provision in section 117 B (3) that it is in the
       public interest that a person is financially independent. The judge
       referred to her husband not meeting the minimum income requirement in
       the rules and concluded they were not financially independent.

    9. At paragraph 142 the judge referred to section 117 B (6). The judge
       also referred to Zambrano and whether the removal of the appellant
       would mean the child in reality would have to leave. The judge noted
       that the appellant's husband and child could remain in the United
       Kingdom as of right. The conclusion was that it was down to parental
       choice. The judge concluded that the decision was proportionate.

Permission to appeal.

   10. Detailed grounds seeking permission to appeal were submitted. The
       First-tier tribunal refuse leave but it was granted directly from the
       upper tribunal. The leave referred to the determination as being very
       careful and so but it was accepted that the grounds upon which leave
       was sought identified arguable errors of law.

At hearing.

   11. At the outset the appellant's representative indicated there were
       factual errors in the immigration judge's financial calculations
       which in turn infected the proportionality assessment. In particular
       the wage slips referred to weekly rather than monthly sums as stated
       by the judge. The appellant's husband had contended he earned in
       excess of �20,000 per annum which the judge rejected. Furthermore,
       the P 45 submitted only related to the relevant financial year and
       not the entire period of employment as stated by the judge. Finally,
       it was submitted that section 117 (B) 6 was not adequately dealt was
       in relation to the child's father.

   12. Mr Diwnycz did not seek to argue against the correctness of these
       submissions nor did he suggest that the factual errors made no
       material difference.

   13. I note the earliest payslip in the papers is dated the 7th July 2015
       and refers to a gross pay to date of �4876. The last payslip is 4
       November 2015 showing a gross pay to date of �12,226. Going from the
       start of the tax year this would cover a seven-month period.



Material error of law

   14. It is obvious from reading the decision of First-tier Tribunal Cope
       the appeal was carefully considered and detailed reference made to
       the relevant provisions and case law. However, there were factual
       errors as highlighted by the appellant's representative. This means
       the proportionality assessment is fatally flawed. Consequently, a
       material error of law has been established and the decision cannot
       stand.

Disposal

   15. It was agreed between the parties that the most appropriate step was
       for the appeal to be relisted for a de novo hearing in the First-tier
       Tribunal. This is because of the factual issues which will have to be
       established and evaluated in the article 8 assessment. The
       appellant's representative has also indicated that new issues have
       arisen. Whilst the matter is being remitted the appellant and her
       husband should bear in mind this is no guarantee of a successful
       outcome.



Decision.

The decision of First-tier Tribunal Cope contains a material error of law
and is set aside. The decision is to be made de novo by a freshly
constituted First-tier Tribunal

DIRECTIONS


    1. List for a de novo hearing in the First-tier Tribunal.

    2. The appellant's representative should prepare a fresh appeal bundle
       containing an index, page numbers and pagination. Original
       documentation should be available in addition to the copies made.

    3. The appellant's representative should advise the respondent
       immediately of any new arguments or documentation.

    4. A Thai interpreter should be arranged for the hearing. If the
       appellant's representatives decide an interpreter is not required
       they should advise the tribunal no later than one week before the
       date of hearing.
