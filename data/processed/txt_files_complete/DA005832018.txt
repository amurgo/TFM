                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. There is no application to make an anonymity order and we see no reason
    to make one.

Appellant and these proceedings

 2. The Appellant is a Portuguese citizen  aged  30-year-old.   He  appeals
    against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Trevaskis  ("the
    Judge") promulgated on 7 July 2019 whereby  he  dismissed  his  appeal,
    brought on EEA and Article 8 grounds, against a decision dated 30  July
    2018 to make a deportation order.

 3. Permission to appeal was granted by  Upper Tribunal Judge  Sheridan  on
    16 August 2019 on the basis that it was arguable  that  the  Judge  had
    erred by failing to have regard to  the  letter  from  the  appellant's
    offender manager dated 27 June 2019 where she said that  the  appellant
    is assessed as low risk of  harm  and  low  risk  of  reoffending  when
    deciding whether the appellant (who was found to not  have  acquired  a
    permanent  right  of  residence)  represents  a  genuine,  present  and
    sufficiently  serious  threat  under   regulation   27(5)(c)   of   the
    Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2016.

Discussion

 4. In his grounds,  the  appellant  contends  that  the  Judge  failed  to
    undertake an adequate assessment of  whether  or  not  the  appellant's
    personal conduct represents a genuine, present and sufficiently serious
    threat affecting one of the fundamental interests  of  society,  namely
    public safety.  In particular the judge failed to have  any  regard  to
    the quality and quantity of rehabilitative courses that  the  appellant
    has successfully completed and the "extremely positive" and  up-to-date
    letter in support of the appellant prepared by the appellant's offender
    manager dated 27 June 2019.

 5. We find no merit here. As the grounds themselves point out,  the  Judge
    refers to the courses, and finds that progress has been significant and
    commendable, (see paragraph 12, 13, 22, and 43 of  the  determination).
    Accordingly, clearly the Judge has  had  regard  to  the  courses.  The
    grounds' assertion that the Judge has failed to take into  account  the
    letter from  probation  assessing  the  appellant  as  a  low  risk  of
    reoffending overlooks  the  Judge's  explicit  reference  to  counsel's
    reliance on that evidence at paragraph 34 of the decision. We could not
    see, and counsel was unable to take us to, anything in the evidence  in
    the Judge's decision which would indicate that he had taken a different
    view of the risk. A complete and fair reading  of  the  decision  shows
    that the Judge correctly self-directed at paragraph 9 in respect of the
    threshold test. At paragraph 41 the Judge has given adequate  reasoning
    for finding that the appellant's personal conduct represents a  genuine
    present and sufficiently serious threat. The Judge  took  into  account
    the appellant's personal conduct of having been convicted  of  offences
    increasing  in seriousness, culminating in what  the  sentencing  judge
    described as "the very serious charge of conspiracy to commit fraud  by
    false representation" with the defendants benefiting to the  extent  of
    just under �50,000, as well finding  that  because  the  appellant  was
    subject to a suspended sentence order at the time of the commission  of
    the  offence  there  was  an  aggravating  factor.  The   evidence   of
    rehabilitation did not show that rehabilitation had been  completed  so
    that the appellant is of no risk. The Judge's conclusion was not argued
    as perverse. In short, the Judge was entitled to  his  conclusion  that
    the personal conduct of the appellant represents a genuine, present and
    sufficiently serious threat.

 6. The second limb to the grounds challenges the Judge's consideration  of
    the issue of proportionality relevant both to the EEA  Regulations  and
    Article 8 of the ECHR. The Judge  concluded  there  would  be  no  very
    significant obstacle to the appellant's  integration  in  Portugal.  He
    rejected the Appellant's claim that he could not  speak  Portuguese  or
    would be unable to acquire a working familiarity with the language very
    quickly and concluded that he would be able  to  find  employment,  and
    that he has family in Portugal from whom he could expect  support.  The
    Judge found, in  the  context  of  the  Immigration  Rules  vis  �  vis
    deportation of a foreign criminal of the appellant's  order,  that  the
    children, who are in the care of the local authority, could  remain  in
    the UK and be placed for long term fostering or adoption without  undue
    hardship in the event that the authorities decided they should  not  go
    with the father and, in the event that that  children  could  accompany
    the father, that it would not be unduly harsh for them  to  do  so.  In
    terms of s 117C(5) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002
    it is the latter which is most relevant.

 7. The crux of the grounds is that  the  Judge  failed  to  give  adequate
    consideration to the documentary evidence concerning the two  children,
    in particular to the final care plan written by  a  social  worker  for
    Newport City Council dated 12 February  2019,  as  well  as  a  Cafcass
    report of 5 February 2019, and an earlier parenting assessment  of  the
    appellant dated October 2018.

 8. We conclude that the decision shows the Judge was  well  aware  of  the
    background of the care proceedings and the fact  the  children  are  in
    foster care, not least because he  makes  several  references  to  that
    position, including setting out at paragraph 6  the  respondent's  view
    that their best interests would be served by remaining in the  care  of
    the local authority until arrangements can be made for long-term foster
    care or adoption. The Judge sets out in some detail between  paragraphs
    21 and 26 the up-to-date evidence from the social worker  who  appeared
    before him, including the fact that, in the event  the  appellant  were
    deported to Portugal, it would be possible for the children to go  with
    him. We pause to note that her evidence  echoes  her  final  care  plan
    report, where at pages 30-31 there  is  reference  to  Portuguese-based
    social  services  and  continuing  oversight  from  the  Court  out  of
    jurisdiction.  The Guardian also points out  at  4.6  that,  given  his
    positive parenting assessment, any opposition to the  children's  going
    to Portugal would require justification. Mr Joseph was unable  to  take
    us to anything in the documentary evidence referred to in  the  grounds
    which was not adequately encompassed in the Judge's reasoning.  Indeed,
    his submission at the First-tier Tribunal was to  the  point  that  the
    evidence was that it was in the children's best interests to stay  with
    their father.

 9. The grounds' challenge to the Judge's assessment of proportionality  is
    essentially a reworking of the above points with explicit reference  to
    the unduly harsh test in  respect  of  the  children  set  out  in  the
    Immigration Rules and section  117C(5)  of  the  2002  Act,  and  bring
    nothing new to the discussion.

10. Although not raised in the grounds, there was some  discussion  at  the
    hearing before us as to whether or not the Judge's conclusion  that  it
    would not be unduly harsh  on  the  children  to  go  to  Portugal  was
    predicated on a mistaken belief  that  the  children  could  be  looked
    after by their abusive grandfather, which conclusion would run contrary
    to the  evidence  of  the  social  worker  opposing  contact  with  the
    appellant's parents in the context of the history of domestic violence.
    The issue arose because the Judge  refers  to  the  support  of  family
    members without expressly excluding the grandfather. We consider it  in
    some detail because of the priority of the interests of the children.

11. We conclude such an interpretation is not borne out when  the  decision
    is read in the context of how the case was argued before the Judge  and
    the detail of the evidence. The content of the  February  2019  reports
    before the Judge showed  the  appellant  had  complained  of  suffering
    violence at the hands of his father during his  teenage  years  in  the
    United  Kingdom  and  had  reported  his  father  to  the  police.  The
    appellant's parents are  now  separated  and  the  network  and  family
    support to which the Judge refers is  shown  in  the  evidence  not  to
    include his father. In the context  of  discussions  about  taking  the
    children to Portugal  if  he  is  deported,  rather  than  their  being
    fostered and adopted here, he disclosed that he  could  expect  support
    from his sisters and his mother. In February 2019,  the  appellant  was
    not considered suitable to look after the children  alone  and  he  put
    forward his mother and sisters as supportive and responsible carers and
    invited social services to assess them as such. It is clear  that  this
    was offered as an alternative to taking  the  children  into  long-term
    foster care/adoption in the United Kingdom, as the  discussion  between
    the social worker and the mother set out in the care plan show. In  the
    event, things have moved on since then, as the appellant's own standing
    as a caring parent has increased. As the Judge notes, the social worker
    states in her evidence that there were no child  protection  issues  in
    respect of the appellant, and there is no evidence he would not protect
    his children from his abusive father.  All  the  evidence  is  that  he
    actually has no contact, and would not contemplate  contact,  with  his
    father. The Judge's conclusion must be  read  in  the  context  of  the
    evidence and the argument.

12. In summary, the Judge explained to the parties  and  provided  adequate
    reasons  for  his  findings,   taking   into   account   the   personal
    circumstances, including the best interests of the children,  that  the
    deportation decision is proportionate, viewed through both the lens  of
    the EEA Regulations and Article 8 ECHR.

Decision

13. We are satisfied that the decision is not flawed by a material error of
    law and the decision dismissing the appeal stands.
