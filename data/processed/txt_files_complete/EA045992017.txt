Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr P Haywood, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr T Wilding, Home Office Presenting Officer
                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an  appeal  against  a  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    dismissing the appellant's appeal against a decision of  the  Secretary
    of State refusing to issue an EEA residence card. The grounds of appeal
    settled by Mr David Linnear of Counsel conclude at  paragraph  15  with
    the words "The respondent's decision  to  refuse  the  appellant's  EEA
    residence card application is flawed".

 2. It is.

 3.  Before  me,  Mr  Wilding  accepted  immediately  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's analysis of the evidence, for  all  the  reasons  criticised
    under ground 2 of Counsel's grounds, is just unsatisfactory and nothing
    can be salvaged.

 4. It follows therefore that there has been  no  proper  analysis  of  the
    evidence and the decision must be set aside, and it is  appropriate  to
    return it to the First-tier Tribunal where the case  will  have  to  be
    heard again.

 5. There remains a dispute between the parties  about  where  the  correct
    burden of proof lies in cases such  as  this.   That  may  have  to  be
    resolved in this Tribunal one day, but for present purposes  nothing  I
    say today is intended to illuminate that  issue  which  will  take  the
    course it takes when the First-tier Tribunal looks at it again.

Notice of Decision

Nevertheless, by consent the parties agree the decision  is  unsatisfactory,
that the proper remedy is to set aside the decision in order  for  the  case
to be reheard to the First-tier  Tribunal.   I  allow  the  appeal  to  that
extent.
