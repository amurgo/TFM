Representation:

For the Appellant:     The Sponsor
For the Respondent:    Ms Emily Martin, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a national of  the  Philippines,  now  aged  13.    He
    applied to the respondent for entry clearance to the United Kingdom  as
    the child of the sponsor, who has indefinite leave  to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom.  His application  was  refused  on  17  May  2012.   He
    appealed to the First-tier Tribunal, and  Judge  Howard  dismissed  his
    appeal.  In order to succeed  in  an  application  or  an  appeal,  the
    appellant needed to show that, at the date of the decision, he met  all
    the requirements of paragraph  297  of  the  Statement  of  Changes  in
    Immigration Rules, HC 395.  Neither the Entry Clearance Officer nor the
    judge of the First-tier Tribunal was satisfied that the sponsor had had
    sole  responsibility  for  the  appellant's  upbringing,  or  that  the
    accommodation requirements of the Rules were met.

 2. The appellant, through the sponsor,  then  applied  for  permission  to
    appeal to this Tribunal.  The First-tier Tribunal  refused  permission.
    When the application was renewed, Upper Tribunal Judge McGeachy granted
    permission, on the basis that "it is, just, arguable" that  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge had erred in his approach to  sole  responsibility.
    Judge McGeachy made no reference to the  difficulties  in  relation  to
    accommodation.

 3. The sponsor appeared  before  us,  and  told  us  something  about  the
    accommodation.  She pays rent of ï¿½250 a month to a  friend,  with  whom
    she shares a house.  She has her own bedroom, as does the  friend,  her
    landlady.  We received the clear impression that they share the rest of
    the premises.  When asked where the appellant would live if he came  to
    the United Kingdom, the sponsor asserted that there was a study at  the
    house, which could be converted into a bedroom for him.  There had,  we
    think, been no previous reference to this proposed arrangement.

 4. The Entry Clearance Officer and the judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    appear to have been troubled by what  they  saw  as  a  lack  of  clear
    evidence that the rent was in fact being paid.  The  position  is  that
    there are, in the  sponsor's  bank  statements,  a  number  of  regular
    payments to a payee whom she identified as her landlady.  The  payments
    are not always of the amount of rent.  The sponsor  told  us  that  the
    reason for that is that they also share household  expenses,  and  that
    there is sometimes a balance due to one or the other  of  them  arising
    out of shopping trips.  We are content for the purposes of this  appeal
    to accept that explanation, and we accept that there is, and  has  been
    for some years, an arrangement under which the sponsor pays her  friend
    in order to share her house.

 5.  That,  however,  is  not  the  principal  question  in   relation   to
    accommodation so far as  we  are  concerned.   We  are  concerned  with
    whether there will be adequate accommodation for the  appellant  if  he
    were to come to the United Kingdom.  On that point the evidence is,  to
    say the least, less than satisfactory.  It seems to us that there would
    need to be evidence  of  what  the  arrangements  for  the  appellant's
    accommodation  would  be,  and  evidence  that  those  proposals  could
    genuinely  take  effect.   In  particular,  the  appellant,  presumably
    through the sponsor, would need to show that he would  have  access  to
    some part of the house other than his mother's  bedroom,  for  his  own
    purposes (sharing a bedroom with his mother would, at his age,  not  be
    adequate accommodation for either of them.)

 6. The starting point in assessing the accommodation must be  the  tenancy
    agreement between the sponsor and her friend, which, the  sponsor  told
    us, was entered into in order to support the present  application.   It
    is a document in standard form by which the sponsor's friend  lets  the
    house to her.  That immediately  presents  a  difficulty,  because  the
    tenancy agreement, clearly binding on both the sponsor and her  friend,
    gives the sponsor exclusive occupation  of  the  entire  house  as  the
    tenant.  In other words, the evidence that has been  produced  for  the
    present application does not reflect the true situation as described by
    both the sponsor and, in a letter to the  Tribunal,  the  friend.   The
    friend's letter is dated 26 December 2012.  It  does  not  specify  the
    parts of the house that the sponsor occupies or is entitled to  occupy.
    It refers to the two bedrooms and to "one study room, which  is  to  be
    converted as a spare bedroom".  The friend writes "I believe that  [the
    appellant] will be accommodated well in  this  house".   She  does  not
    appear to give any undertaking to that effect,  she  does  not  specify
    that the "spare" bedroom will be committed to the appellant's use,  and
    she provides no explanation for the fact that, if the tenancy agreement
    is to be believed, she is no longer to be regarded  as  living  in  the
    house at all.

 7. The letter post-dates the decision, and  in  our  judgement  cannot  be
    relied upon as accurately reflecting plans that had already  been  made
    before the date of the decision.  In any event, it is  clear  that  the
    sponsor and her friend were prepared to try and mislead the Tribunal by
    together constructing a document which does  not  reflect  reality  but
    which does, on any reading of it, indicate  that  the  sponsor  has  an
    entire house available to her on a legally enforceable lease.

 8. In those circumstances it cannot be said that any  error  made  by  the
    Judge in assessing the evidence as to accommodation was one which ought
    to cause his determination on that or any other issue to be set  aside.
    The evidence is clearly wholly insufficient to establish that,  on  his
    arrival in the  United  Kingdom,  the  appellant  would  be  adequately
    accommodated.

 9. In those circumstances we need to say little about the judge's approach
    to sole responsibility, save this.  If  it  had  been  the  only  issue
    before us we might have had  some  doubts  about  whether  the  judge's
    conclusions on sole responsibility could properly be sustained.  If the
    sponsor still wants the appellant to come and live with her, there will
    need to be a new application, in which  all  the  requirements  of  the
    rules are properly addressed.  We do  not  think  that  anybody  should
    place reliance upon the conclusions of the judge on whether the sponsor
    has had sole responsibility for the appellant: it is a matter that will
    need to be decided anew on the evidence available at the  time  of  any
    future application.

10. For the reasons we have given in  relation  to  accommodation  however,
    this appeal must be dismissed and we dismiss it.
