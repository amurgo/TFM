For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal  against  a  decision  by  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Agnew dismissing an appeal under the Immigration Rules and  on
    human rights grounds.

 2. The Appellant was born on 20th February  1984  and  is  a  national  of
    Canada.  She is married to a British citizen, AG.   The  Appellant  has
    five children, all of whom are with her in the UK.

 3. The appeal was previously heard by me on 16th March 2016 on  the  issue
    of whether there was an error of law in the decision of the  First-tier
    Tribunal such that it should be set aside.  In a  decision  dated  20th
    May 2016 I found that there was an error  of  law  and  set  aside  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal.  The appeal was relisted before me
    in the Upper Tribunal for the decision to be re-made.

 4. My reasons for finding an error of law were set out in  a  decision  of
    20th May 2016, which was issued to the parties.

 5. In summary the reasons for finding an error of law were that the  Judge
    of the First-tier Tribunal had  proceeded  to  carry  out  a  balancing
    exercise under Article 8 with regard  to  the  best  interests  of  the
    children without awaiting developments in concurrent family proceedings
    in the Sheriff Court.   I  made  the  point  that  I  had  considerable
    sympathy for the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal, who made a  decision
    based on the evidence before her and the apparent circumstances at  the
    time.  On many occasions such an approach would be  applauded.   Where,
    however, there were proceedings in the Sheriff Court affecting not only
    the Appellant but her five children, it would have been appropriate for
    the judge to take a more circumspect approach.   Not  only  were  there
    proceedings in the Sheriff Court but there was social work involvement.
     The powers of a Sheriff to enquire into the best interests of children
    in the course of proceedings are stronger than the powers of the First-
    tier Tribunal.  Involvement of the Sheriff  together  with  the  social
    work  department  provided  an  even  more  powerful  combination   for
    assessing the circumstances of the children.  The Judge of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal was required to take into account the best  interests  of
    the children, even though they were  a  primary  and  not  a  paramount
    consideration, and this required not cutting across the jurisdiction of
    the Sheriff Court.

 6. At the hearing on 16th March 2016 it was pointed out by the  Presenting
    Officer for the Secretary of State that as a matter of fact there  were
    no further proceedings  in  the  Sheriff  Court  after  the  First-tier
    Tribunal made its decision.  This was because  the  Appellant  and  her
    husband had reconciled and the social workers withdrew  their  interest
    in the family as a whole.  The Appellant's husband was acquitted of any
    criminal act against the Appellant.  This was not, however, foreseeable
    at the date of the hearing before the  First-tier  Tribunal.   It  was,
    furthermore, an outcome of the court proceedings which cast significant
    light on the children's circumstances

 7. I was satisfied that in the circumstances of this particular case,  and
    having regard to its subsequent history, the proper course  would  have
    been to await further developments in the family proceedings.  It is to
    be noted that the Tribunal when sitting in  Scotland  is  not  able  to
    avail itself of any protocols such as the Family  Protocol  adopted  by
    the English courts, which allows the Tribunal to make enquiries of  the
    judge in the Family Court as to the course of proceedings.

Evidence

 8. Following the setting aside of the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal
    the parties were given an opportunity to file further evidence  showing
    the family's up-to-date circumstances, including the  earnings  of  the
    Appellant's husband.  In addition, although the five  children  of  the
    Appellant are not British citizens  but  are  Canadian  by  nationality
    there was a possibility of certain of the children applying for British
    citizenship by registration or naturalisation.

 9. For the purpose of the resumed hearing before me, the Appellant  lodged
    five Inventories of Productions, the  contents  of  which  were  listed
    therewith.  There was also a letter dated 30th  November  2015  from  a
    social worker at Renfrewshire Council and a discharge letter dated  3rd
    March 2014 for  the  Appellant  from  the  Southern  General  Hospital,
    Glasgow.  Also lodged were reports on the treatment  of  children  with
    disabilities in the Canadian educational system.

10. The hearing before me began with a discussion between the parties as to
    whether the Appellant  was  able  to  rely  upon  Appendix  FM  of  the
    Immigration Rules or only on Article 8 outwith the Rules.   Mr  Liaquat
    indicated that he would  be  seeking  to  make  submissions  under  the
    Immigration Rules.  Mr Matthews pointed out that as the  Appellant  was
    last given leave as  a  visitor  on  5th  September  2013,  before  the
    application giving rise to the present appeal was  made  on  4th  March
    2014, she could not succeed under Appendix FM in terms of paragraph  E-
    LTRP.3.1(a).  Mr Matthews further submitted that  paragraph  276ADE  of
    the Immigration Rules did not apply and there was no qualifying  child.
    In relation to this point Mr Matthews sought to rely on the decision of
    the Court of Appeal in  MA  (Pakistan)  [2016]  EWCA  Civ  705  on  the
    application of section 117B(6) of the 2002 Act.

11. Four  witnesses  were  called  at  the  hearing.   The  first  was  the
    Appellant, who adopted her witness statement.  When cross-examined  she
    said she met her husband, AG, in May 2008.  At that  time  she  already
    had three daughters by two different fathers.  The eldest, N1, had last
    seen her father when she was about 5 and he was deceased.  The next two
    children by age, N2 and N3, had the  same  father.   N2  last  saw  her
    father when she was about 3 and N3  had  never  met  her  father.   The
    Appellant said that there was no father on N3's birth certificate.   It
    was pointed out that in a statement the Appellant had made  in  October
    2014 she had said  the  father  was  added  to  the  birth  certificate
    subsequently but the Appellant said this was incorrect.  It was put  to
    the Appellant that she had not been truthful in  this  statement  where
    she said that AG had been subsequently added to N3's birth  certificate
    as her father.  The Appellant seemed to indicate that  the  Appellant's
    husband, AG, had suggested this himself.  The Appellant  said  she  was
    told by her husband this was the right  thing  to  do.   The  Appellant
    acknowledged she thought she would gain an advantage by this.

12. The Appellant confirmed that she entered the UK in February 2013.   Her
    husband, AG, was already here.  This was because his father was unwell.
     AG had received a phone call after Christmas to say  that  his  father
    had prostate cancer.  The Appellant was asked if AG intended to  return
    to Canada to be with the Appellant and  the  children.   The  Appellant
    said he did  not  intend  to  at  the  time  because  the  couple  were
    separated.  The Appellant explained that she was in a shelter with post-
    partum depression.  The couple were still seeing  each  other  but  not
    living in the same house.  They did not discuss AG's return because  he
    had left within 48 hours of the phone call.  The Appellant  decided  to
    come to the UK a month and a half later because she wanted to  be  with
    her husband.  The Appellant confirmed  that  she  was  given  leave  on
    arrival in the UK.  She did not ask to be admitted as a visitor but she
    was asked who she was seeing and where she was going and how  long  she
    would be here for.  She acknowledged that she  intended  to  stay  here
    with the children.  She assumed that she could come and stay  with  her
    husband.  She had not done any prior research on the Immigration Rules.



13. The Appellant was asked why she did not apply for leave to remain until
    March 2014.  The Appellant said at first that she did not know what  to
    do but she  had  discussed  the  issue  with  her  husband.   They  had
    approached their representatives to make an application.

14. It was pointed out to the Appellant that  she  had  previously  told  a
    judge at a hearing in October 2014 that she had decided to stay in  the
    UK only after her arrival here.  The Appellant responded that this  was
    not a definite decision to stay.  Her sister had had to empty her house
    in Canada and sell the contents.  As far as she was  concerned  if  her
    husband decided to stay here then she would stay.  Her husband said  it
    was best for the children to see his father because he had cancer.

15. The Appellant said that N1 was 11 when the family came to the UK.   She
    had been at school in February 2013.  The Appellant was asked what  she
    had said to N1 about going back to Canada.  The Appellant said she  had
    told N1 she was coming to see  her  grandparents.   The  Appellant  was
    asked if N1 had assumed  that  she  would  then  be  going  home.   The
    Appellant said she did not know.  She thought N1  must  have  overheard
    her talking to her husband on the phone.   The  Appellant  acknowledged
    that N1 had friends and  cousins  in  Canada.   The  cousins  lived  in
    another province.  They were her  husband's  brother's  children.   The
    Appellant denied that she was using her children's interests as a means
    to stay in the UK.  She said that after the family had been in  the  UK
    for three years it would be even more unsettling and upsetting to move.
     The children had formed close friendships.

16. The Appellant was asked why it was okay to take her oldest  child  away
    from her friends in Canada at the age of 11 but it  was  difficult  now
    for her to leave the UK.  The Appellant replied that at that stage  the
    other girls were younger.  N1 had her sisters and was more excited than
    upset about leaving Canada.  The Appellant was  asked  if  N1  had  not
    always got on with the Appellant's husband.  The Appellant acknowledged
    that they had not got on together in the last few years  but  they  did
    get on together now.  The Appellant was asked if N1  had  alleged  that
    the Appellant's husband, AG, had been abusive to the Appellant and N1's
    sisters.  The Appellant replied that AG had spanked N3 and N1  did  not
    think this was right.  The Appellant was asked if AG had  been  abusive
    to her.  The Appellant replied that this was "more by mouth" and N1 did
    not like the things he had said.  The  Appellant  was  asked  what  had
    changed.  She said that AG and N1 had a talk with no-one else  present.
    AG said things would change and he had kept his word.

17. The Appellant was asked about her history of the involvement  with  the
    social services in Canada.  The  Appellant  denied  that  this  was  "a
    history" but said she had had post-partum depression.  She was asked if
    the involvement with the social services was from December  2012  until
    February 2013.  She acknowledged this and said her son had been born in
    August and she had reached out to them.  AG had been away  working  for
    up to four months at a time and the Appellant needed support.

18. The Appellant was  asked  about  an  incident  which  had  led  to  the
    involvement of Renfrewshire Council.  The Appellant said  that  AG  had
    broken the TV and she had asked him  to  leave.   It  was  put  to  the
    Appellant that she had also said that he had  slapped  her  face.   The
    Appellant said she did not  remember  this  and  no  charges  had  been
    brought.  The Appellant went on to say that she had said  this  to  the
    police so they would take him away because he was drunk.  The Appellant
    was asked if she had lied to the police.  The Appellant  said  that  AG
    was physically aggressive to her.  He had taken the remote  and  broken
    the TV.  He had put his hands on her.  She acknowledged  that  she  had
    lied to the police because she was scared.

19. It was put to the Appellant that  she  had  contacted  social  services
    after breaking down.  The Appellant said again that she had post-partum
    depression but did not know what this was.  She was told  by  women  in
    her church to contact the social work department.  It was  put  to  the
    Appellant that  she  had  applied  for  respite  care.   The  Appellant
    explained that this was because of difficulties with her  daughter  N3.
    The Appellant acknowledged that she was taken  to  hospital  after  her
    mother-in-law called an ambulance.

20. The Appellant was  asked  if  her  husband,  AG,  had  ever  physically
    chastised any of the children apart from N3.  The Appellant said he had
    spanked them and that both of them had done this.  The  Appellant  said
    she had been involved with a social worker  in  the  UK  and  with  the
    police.  AG had been charged by the police at one point.  The Appellant
    and her daughter were the alleged victims.  She was  asked  if  AG  had
    been acquitted.  The Appellant said the charges were thrown out and she
    did not know if that meant he was acquitted.  She and AG had  got  back
    together again early in January 2015.  At the  time  of  the  trial  in
    February 2015 although they were back together AG  still  had  separate
    accommodation and had not moved back into the house.

21. The Appellant acknowledged that N3 attended a special school.  She  was
    now aged 9 having arrived at the age of 5 in February  2013.   At  that
    time she had not  started  school.   The  Appellant  acknowledged  that
    schools in Canada started in the first or second week in September  and
    that children started school at the age of 5.  The Appellant was  asked
    when she was first  aware  that  N3  had  learning  difficulties.   The
    Appellant said that this was when N3 was 18 months old.  There  was  no
    diagnosis.  N3 had been tested and had worked with a physical therapist
    and child psychologist.  N3 had not gone to school at the age of  5  in
    Canada because they could not handle her and she had remained at  home.
    In the UK an application had been made for a teaching assistant but  it
    was too late in the school year so N3 had gone  to  a  special  school.
    The Appellant said she did not know this help was available in  Canada.



22. The Appellant said she sees her husband's parents about twice  a  week.
    It was put to her that her  mother-in-law  told  the  doctor  that  the
    Appellant saw them about once a week.  The Appellant said her mother-in-
    law was forgetful and became easily confused.

23. The Appellant acknowledged that three of her  children  were  under  8.
    She was asked if the  behaviour  of  N3  was  still  challenging.   The
    Appellant replied that it was at times but it was a  lot  better.   She
    was on a good programme that had boosted her confidence.

24. The second witness was the Appellant's husband,  AG.   He  adopted  his
    statement.  He was asked how many biological children he had  with  the
    Appellant and he replied that he had two.

25. AG was cross-examined.  He said he came back to the UK in January  2013
    on his own.  He said that he and the Appellant had been living together
    in Canada before that.   He  acknowledged  that  they  had  been  going
    through a rough time but they shared the same address.  He did not know
    when he came over that his father was not well but his father told  him
    when he came back.  He explained that his father had looked unwell  the
    previous summer but AG did not know he had cancer.  AG was asked why he
    had come back to the UK.  AG explained  that  the  Appellant  had  been
    unwell with post-natal depression and he had needed a break.   When  he
    came back to the UK he found out  his  father  had  cancer.   This  was
    around a week after he arrived.  It was put to him that in his  witness
    statement he had said that his father had said  on  the  phone  he  had
    cancer.  AG replied that he knew his father was unwell but did not know
    he had cancer.  He confirmed that it was not accurate for his statement
    to say his father had said on the phone that he  had  cancer.   AG  was
    asked why this was in the statement.  AG said his mother had wanted  to
    tell him but his father was against it.  He knew his father was unwell.
     AG was asked why he had not said in  his  witness  statement  that  he
    needed a breathing space from his wife.  AG explained that he  had  not
    put this in the statement but the evidence showed that they were  going
    through a hard time.  His wife had driven him to the airport.  They had
    had a discussion about him coming to the UK knowing his father was ill.
     AG said he was "pretty sure" they would have  had  that  conversation.
    He confirmed that he had intended to return to Canada.   His  work  was
    seasonal and he had been laid off in December until the spring.  It was
    not envisaged that his wife would join him  with  the  children.   They
    talked about how good it would be if the Appellant came over to the UK.
     AG said it was not a conspiracy to come over here.  It  was  something
    that was talked about, as they talked about moving to Ontario where the
    children's aunties and cousins were or as they talked about divorce and
    separation.  AG was asked if the decision to stay  was  made  when  his
    wife arrived in the UK.  AG said to be honest at the time they did  not
    know exactly what they wanted.  They wanted their relationship to  work
    out but did not know  how  to  deal  with  everything.   The  Appellant
    arrived in February 2013 at Gatwick.  AG confirmed  that  he  knew  his
    wife had the right to be here only for six months.  He  had  been  told
    that the children were only allowed to be  here  for  six  months.   AG
    confirmed that they had gone to Spain for seven nights in August  2013.
    The Appellant at that time was  an  overstayer.   It  was  put  to  the
    witness that after they returned it had taken them six months to pursue
    regularising their status.  AG explained that  the  Appellant  was  his
    wife and he was British.  They have children.  AG said he had moved  to
    the UK when he was 12 and there had  been  no  mention  of  immigration
    issues.  He confirmed that he was a joint British and Canadian citizen,
    as were his parents.

26. It was pointed out to AG that his wife and children were  not  British.
    AG said he would disagree.  He knew the  matter  was  complicated.   It
    cost �900 to apply for a certificate of naturalisation.  As far  as  he
    was concerned they were British and entitled to be here.  It was put to
    AG that on arrival his children had no entitlement to citizenship.   AG
    said he disagreed and he believed they did.  AG explained that when the
    family returned from Spain they were told to go to the Home  Office  in
    Govan.  They had a card with the name of their  representative  on  it.
    AG said his wife and children were told to return to Govan the next day
    but their  representative  said  the  process  would  take  years.   AG
    apologised for what the family had done but said he  had  thought  that
    what they were doing was right.

27. AG was asked if he had thought with his wife to say  that  N3  was  his
    child.  AG replied that she was his child.  He  acknowledged  that  she
    was not biologically his child but said very few people knew that.  She
    had special needs.  He acknowledged that he and  his  wife  had  talked
    about this.  They did not want N3 to think that she  had  two  daddies.
    She would not be able to comprehend this.

28. It was put to AG that it sounded as if he had  said  that  N3  was  his
    child in order to obtain an advantage.  AG denied this.  His  wife  had
    shown the school the birth certificate and said that all  the  children
    could use AG's surname.

29. It was put to AG  that  his  wife  and  children  could  not  meet  the
    Immigration Rules.  They had come to the UK as visitors and  could  not
    succeed under the Rules.  He was asked why an exception should be  made
    for them.  AG replied that the family had been here  for  three  and  a
    half years.  They had a fairly good lifestyle.  The  children  were  at
    home here.  The eldest wanted to be a vet and the  best  education  for
    vets was here.  His daughter N3 was at a  special  needs  school.   Her
    confidence and understanding had gone through the roof.   The  youngest
    child has a Scottish accent.  It was put to AG that  the  children  had
    been brought from Canada without any choice.   He  replied  that  as  a
    parent the choice was made for them.  He was asked if the appeal failed
    whether he would return to Canada  with  his  wife  and  children.   He
    replied "no", and added that he did not think this  would  happen.   He
    was asked if he was saying he would not respect  the  decision  of  the
    Tribunal.  He said his family could not be separated.  He  would  cross
    bridges when he came to them but he  would  fight  for  the  family  to
    remain here.

30. The next witness was AG's father, who adopted  his  witness  statement.
    He said as well as AG he had another son and a daughter.  His  daughter
    lives in Erskine but his other son lives in Canada.

31. AG's mother was called as a witness and adopted her  letter  which  she
    had signed as her statement.  She was not questioned or cross-examined.



Submissions

32. After I heard the evidence each party made their submissions,  starting
    with Mr Matthews on behalf of the  Respondent.   He  pointed  out  that
    under the Immigration Rules the Appellant had not been in  the  UK  for
    twenty years.  There were no very significant obstacles preventing  her
    from re-establishing her private life in Canada.  The children were not
    the subject of this appeal  and  had  no  leave  when  the  application
    leading to the present appeal was made.  The Appellant last entered  as
    a visitor in September 2013.  She could not succeed under  Appendix  FM
    when she entered as  a  visitor.   This  was  a  provision  to  prevent
    visitors from switching and  to  discourage  people  from  entering  as
    visitors when they should be entering in a  different  capacity.   This
    provision ought to be given weight when considering Article  8  outside
    the Rules.

33. When looking outside the Rules, Mr  Matthews  continued,  section  117B
    applied.  This specifies  the  public  interest  requirements  and  the
    importance of  being  English  speaking  and  financially  independent.
    These were not positive factors but were neutral  factors,  as  pointed
    out in Rhuppia [2016] EWCA Civ 803.  In terms of  section  117B(4)  the
    Appellant had been here unlawfully for only a few days and this was  of
    little significance.  In  terms  of  section  117B(5)  the  Appellant's
    status was precarious and this was relevant  to  the  establishment  of
    private life.

34. Turning to section 117B(6) Mr  Matthews  submitted  that  none  of  the
    children were qualifying children because none of them  was  a  British
    citizen.  There was an application outstanding to register one child as
    a British citizen and if this was successful then the child would be  a
    British citizen.  At this stage section 117B(6) did not apply.

35. Looking at Article 8 outside the Rules, Mr  Matthews  referred  to  the
    evidence given in cross-examination about the arrival of the  Appellant
    and  her  children.   This  was  relevant  to   the   public   interest
    requirement.  The evidence given was unsatisfactory.  At  the  previous
    hearing the Appellant appeared to say that she had decided to stay only
    after she arrived here.  Her evidence today was that the  decision  was
    made outside the UK.  Her husband's evidence was different  today.   It
    was difficult to work out the truth.  Different reasons had been  given
    for her husband going away.  After the  children  arrived  it  appeared
    that arrangements for schooling and housing had  been  made  reasonably
    quickly.   The  evidence  showed  that  the  social   work   department
    involvement with the family in the UK had ended.  It would appear  that
    proper support had been provided in Canada also.  There was an  element
    of cost to the taxpayer here  and  this  was  relevant  to  the  public
    interest.

36. Mr Matthews continued that there was some evidence about the children's
    circumstances.  It had been suggested that all five children  would  be
    able to register as British citizens but this was doubtful.   No  child
    was a British citizen at present but all  were  Canadian,  as  was  the
    Appellant's husband, who has dual nationality.

37. There was no evidence  to  show  that  the  children  did  not  have  a
    lifestyle in Canada which served their best interests.   Canada  was  a
    country with a well-developed health and education system.  The parents
    have taken the decision to come to the  UK  without  reference  to  the
    children.  A parent might uproot a child and move  but  entitlement  to
    reside was based on the best interests of the children.  It  could  not
    be shown it was contrary to the  best  interests  of  the  children  to
    return to Canada.

38. Mr Matthews acknowledged that the older children were being educated in
    the UK and had friends here and other interests.  In Canada there  were
    other relatives on both sides of the family.   They  would  miss  their
    grandparents in the UK.  It  had  not  been  shown  that  it  would  be
    contrary to their best interests to return to the  country  where  they
    had lived before.

39. Mr Matthews then turned to  N3.   The  evidence  showed  that  she  was
    attending a special needs school where she was doing  well.   This  was
    important and it was good that the child had thrived.  Canada, however,
    was a country where there was a special needs system, as shown  by  the
    documentary evidence.  The system was not perfect but  the  same  point
    could be made about the system in the UK.  N3 was  not  able  to  start
    school at 5 in Canada but the authorities had  been  putting  in  place
    arrangements for the child.  There was no reason why N3's needs  should
    not be met.  Even if it was in the best interests of  the  children  to
    remain here, the public interest would outweigh these  best  interests.
    The family had entered as visitors.   There  had  been  untruthfulness,
    including untruthfulness by the Appellant to the  First-tier  Tribunal.
    This was a serious  matter.   These  were  relevant  considerations  in
    balancing proportionality.

40. Mr Matthews continued that the health of  the  children's  grandparents
    was less than perfect.  The grandfather had recovered from cancer.   He
    had a daughter living nearby who helped out.  The evidence did not show
    a need for the Appellant and her husband to be here  to  care  for  the
    grandparents.  It would understandably be a grandparent's preference to
    have  the  children  here  but  this  did  not  tip  the   balance   of
    proportionality.

41. Although the grandmother had  health  problems  as  well,  the  medical
    evidence did not exclude the possibility  of  visits  to  Canada.   The
    children had a normal relationship with their  grandparents  and  there
    was no doubt they would like this to continue but  this  did  not  show
    that the refusal decision was disproportionate.  The appeal  should  be
    refused both under the Immigration Rules and under Article 8.

42. Mr Liaquat began his submission with reference to the system of special
    needs schools in Canada.  There had been no formal involvement  by  the
    family  with  these  schools.   Instead  there  had  been  a  level  of
    frustration.  The provision varied according to the location.  It might
    be necessary to travel  a  substantial  distance  to  a  special  needs
    school, as  pointed  out  by  the  Appellant  at  paragraph  6  of  her
    statement.

43. Mr Liaquat submitted that the Appellant had  been  very  frank  in  her
    evidence today about the decisions that were made  and  the  advice  or
    misadvice which she may have received.  If the Appellant had wanted  to
    deceive she could have done so.

44. Mr Liaquat referred to documentary evidence in relation to N3  and,  in
    particular, Items 5 and 9 of the second inventory.  There was  evidence
    that  N3  was  affected  by  her  home  circumstances.   Her   planning
    framework, Item 5 at page 61, showed the benefit  for  N3  of  "a  fair
    period of stability".  At page 66 it was pointed out that she  has  low
    self-esteem resulting from her speech  and  language  difficulties  and
    associated challenging behaviour.  Page 71 showed the action  required.
    It was not in the best interests of N3 to be removed from the UK.   She
    had suffered stress in moving here and  had  had  no  formal  education
    before she arrived.  The child was innocent of any  wrongdoing  by  her
    parents.

45. Mr Liaquat referred to a medical report on the children's  grandmother,
    showing issues  with  memory  and  confusion.   The  GP  did  not  have
    sufficient  information  to  decide  if  she  was  fit  to  fly.    The
    grandparents' other son was in Canada but they only  see  him  when  he
    comes to the UK because they were not fit to travel.

46. Mr Liaquat continued that an application had been made for registration
    of one of the children as a British citizen.  The child who had applied
    for British citizenship would obtain this.   The  father's  income  was
    given as �20,000 but the evidence  of  his  bank  statements  and  P60s
    showed that his income was in fact �32,500.  The family should  not  be
    sent back to Canada as an administrative step.

47. The school report for N2, at item 6 of inventory two, showed confidence
    issues for her.  The family had had problems.  Over the last one and  a
    half years there had been a period where the family had started to grow
    and develop together.  The Appellant's husband treated all the children
    as his own, including N3.  If the Appellant was not allowed to stay  in
    the UK this might split the family.  The British citizen child would be
    entitled to remain while  other  members  of  the  family  returned  to
    Canada.  The family had tried to be honest.  They had gone to Spain  on
    holiday and sought to return.  They did not know  the  requirements  of
    the Immigration Rules.  If they had been seeking to deceive they  would
    not have left and returned on this occasion.

48. Mr Liaquat concluded that the crux of the case was the  impact  on  the
    children, especially N3.  Sending her back  to  Canada  after  she  had
    settled in Scotland would be likely to trigger adverse behaviour.   The
    family had been through a difficult time  and  accepted  that  mistakes
    were made.  The appeal should  be  allowed  exceptionally  outside  the
    Rules on genuine, compelling and compassionate reasons.



Discussion

49. It is not disputed that  the  Appellant  will  not  succeed  under  the
    Immigration  Rules.   When  considering  Article  8,  as  Mr   Matthews
    submitted, section 117B applies, in terms of which the  maintenance  of
    effective immigration  controls  is  in  the  public  interest.   Under
    section 117B(5) little  weight  should  be  given  to  a  private  life
    established by a person at a time when the person's immigration  status
    is precarious.  For the Appellant to succeed under the Rules, she  must
    show that there are compelling circumstances which outweigh the  public
    interest in the maintenance of effective immigration controls, in terms
    of SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ 387.

50. It cannot be denied that the Appellant initially showed  little  regard
    for the immigration requirements of the United Kingdom.  She came  here
    as a visitor, with at least some expectation that she and  her  husband
    would remain.  When her leave was due to expire,  the  family  went  to
    Spain, seemingly with the  expectation  that  the  Appellant  would  be
    allowed to re-enter as a visitor for a limited  period.   The  evidence
    about when the family  decided  to  come  to  the  UK  and  what  their
    intentions were is, at best, confused.

51. In the past the family have hardly represented a model of family  life.
    Before they each left Canada the relationship between the Appellant and
    her husband was difficult.  This was attributed to the Appellant's post-
    natal depression.  Even in the UK their relationship had  difficulties.
    The Appellant called the police on one occasion  to  have  her  husband
    taken away from the house when he was drunk and abusive.  As  a  result
    of this incident he was charged but he was not convicted.   The  social
    work  department  became  involved  with  the  family   although   that
    involvement has ceased.  The parents considered that they had the right
    to physically  chastise  the  children.   This  led  to  understandable
    difficulties between the oldest girl, N1, and her  stepfather.   It  is
    said that these issues have now been resolved and this is confirmed  by
    social workers involved (Inventory 2, Item 5, pp 56-57).

52. The parents have not been model parents  but,  as  Mr  Liaquat  rightly
    stated,  the  issue  here  is  the  best  interests  of  the  children,
    particularly those of N3, who has special needs.  I was referred by  Mr
    Liaquat to documentary evidence on N3's needs, at items 5 and 9 of  the
    second  inventory.   Item  5  is  a  planning  framework  prepared   by
    Renfrewshire Children's Services Partnership.  This states that N3  has
    speech and language difficulties.  She is able to speak but her  speech
    is difficult to understand by those who do not know her well.  She will
    repeat herself when asked and use  gestures  to  help  her  convey  her
    message.  She is now 10 years old and the report was prepared when  she
    was 8.  The social worker department in Renfrewshire had contacted  the
    social worker department in Canada for information  about  the  family.
    It was noted that there were no concerns about the Appellant's  ability
    to care for her children and the concerns were solely  in  relation  to
    the Appellant's husband and  his  use  of  physical  chastisement.   By
    December 2014 the Appellant and her husband  had  re-established  their
    relationship.   Further  visits  were  undertaken  by  social  workers.
    Observations were generally positive and the  family  home  had  calmed
    considerably.   This  appeared  to  be   genuine,   given   the   happy
    interactions between the children and their parents, and a more relaxed
    home environment.  No issues or concerns have been raised  in  relation
    to the children's emotional  wellbeing  since  the  couple  reconciled.
    There was no further role for the social workers.

53. The child N3 attends a special school.  She is a happy girl  at  school
    but  can  exhibit  challenging  behaviour,  such  as  hitting,  biting,
    kicking, spitting and throwing objects, when things do not go her  way.
    She is  now  at  the  point  where  she  recognises  her  behaviour  is
    inappropriate but for the moment she is unable to control herself.  She
    has a close relationship with  her  mother  and  talks  fondly  of  her
    sisters and brother.  As she has become older she has become  aware  of
    her differences from other children and this  is  affecting  her  self-
    esteem.  She has received speech and language therapy  and  her  speech
    has improved since attending  the  special  school.   She  needs  close
    supervision at all times, especially when distressed.  The  family  are
    described as living in a four-bedroomed terraced house in  the  Paisley
    area.  The family describe themselves as comfortable.  The father is in
    employment.  The mother is in receipt of DLA for N3.  The  mother  also
    receives child benefit, housing benefit and council tax discount.   The
    report recommends that N3 continues to live with and be  cared  for  by
    her parents, the Appellant and her husband.  It is recommended that the
    parents attend a parenting course should managing N3's behaviour become
    an issue.  N3 would continue to receive speech and language therapy.

54. The second report, at item 9 of the second inventory, is  a  report  on
    language and literacy along the same lines of the first report.

55. A school report dated May 2016 was provided for the eldest  child,  N1.
    At that time N1 was in senior  three  at  Paisley  Grammar  School.   A
    report was provided for N2 from April 2016, when she was in year one at
    Paisley Grammar School.  A report from April 2016 was provided for  the
    fourth child, BG, from primary two at Gallowhill Primary School.

56. Mr Matthews made two points in particular of considerable weight.   The
    first of these was that all the facilities which the children  require,
    including a child with special needs like N3,  would  be  available  in
    Canada.  No system was entirely free from fault or  criticism  but  the
    facilities available in Canada would be on a par with those in the  UK.
    The second point made by Mr Matthews was that even if  it  was  in  the
    best interests of the children to remain  in  the  UK,  this  would  be
    outweighed by the need to maintain effective immigration control.  This
    included the need to have regard to policy considerations expressed  in
    the Rules, such as  the  need  to  discourage  switching  from  visitor
    status.

57. I will begin by addressing the first point.  I fully  accept  that  the
    facilities available in Canada would be generally equivalent  to  those
    available in the UK.  But this, however, is not the  whole  story.   N3
    has been settled for around three  years  in  her  current  environment
    receiving the educational provision tailored for her needs.  It is  not
    just a question of whether equivalent provision would be  available  in
    Canada but what the impact would be on N3  of  removing  her  from  her
    present environment and resettling her  in  a  different,  even  though
    equivalent, environment in Canada.  This would undoubtedly be  a  major
    disruption in her life at an age when she is having to  come  to  terms
    with her differences from other children and her position in the world.
     Mr Matthews commented that it seemed all  right  for  the  parents  to
    decide to bring the children from Canada to the UK  without  consulting
    them but for the reverse journey there had to be consideration  of  the
    children's best interests before they could be returned to  Canada.   I
    accept this seems paradoxical.  Nevertheless,  matters  have  moved  on
    since N3 came to the UK, particularly in relation to her education  and
    the settled environment she requires.  Mr Liaquat submitted  that  over
    the last one and a half years the entire family has started to grow and
    develop together and it is clear from  the  reports  that  this  is  of
    particular benefit to N3, who now has a settled and secure family  home
    as well as a supportive school environment.

58. Mr Matthews pointed out that the children are not  appellants  in  this
    appeal.  The  only  appellant  is  their  mother.   Nevertheless  under
    Article 8 the impact must be considered of the removal of their  mother
    from the UK.  It is clear from the social work report for N3  that  the
    children's mother has always been their principal carer and  that  they
    depend on her care for them.   It  is  almost  inconceivable  that  the
    children would remain  behind  if  their  mother  returned  to  Canada,
    although there is the prospect that their father might  choose  not  to
    accompany them.  Accordingly I have proceeded on the  basis  that  were
    the Appellant to be removed, the children would go with her,  with  all
    the disruption that  this  would  entail.  There  is  nevertheless  the
    possibility that there would be a damaging  effect  upon  the  children
    were their mother to leave them in the  UK  while  she  was  in  Canada
    either permanently or temporarily.

59. Notwithstanding the impact on the family of the Appellant's removal, Mr
    Matthews submitted that the best interests of  the  children  would  be
    outweighed by the public  interest  in  the  maintenance  of  effective
    immigration controls.  Were this  a  family  without  a  special  needs
    child, Mr Matthew's argument would have more weight.  I  am  satisfied,
    however, that the position of N3 is  such  that  there  are  compelling
    circumstances arising from her best interests in remaining in a  secure
    and settled environment in Scotland which outweigh the public interest.
     These circumstances arise  from  the  findings  made  on  the  reports
    referred to above.

60. The question in this appeal is not principally whether  it  was  proper
    for the parents to bring the children to the UK in the first place,  or
    whether the parents have behaved responsibly then and since, or whether
    the children would have access to all the  facilities  they  need  were
    they to return to Canada.  The crucial  issue  is  that  the  children,
    including N3, have been settled in the UK with the  support  that  they
    need, particularly N3, for the last three years or so and the impact of
    requiring the Appellant to return to Canada at this stage would be very
    damaging and disruptive to the best  interests  of  the  children,  and
    particularly those  of  N3.   Even  though  children  without  learning
    difficulties might adapt to their  new  environment  without  too  much
    difficulty this cannot be readily foreseen in the case of  N3.   It  is
    primarily with this consideration in mind that  the  appeal  should  be
    allowed under Article 8 outwith the Immigration Rules.



Conclusion

As previously recorded,  the  making  of  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
Tribunal involved the making of an error on a point of  law.   The  decision
has been set aside.

The appeal is allowed under Article 8.

Anonymity

As stated in the decision of 20th May 2016, because the proceedings  concern
matters relating to the  wellbeing  and  circumstances  of  the  children  I
consider that an anonymity order should be made.  Accordingly,  pursuant  to
Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)  Rules  2008  I  make  an
anonymity order.  Unless the Upper Tribunal or a  court  directs  otherwise,
no report of these proceedings or any form  of  publication  thereof,  shall
directly or indirectly identify the original Appellant.  This order  applies
to, amongst others, all parties.  Any failure  to  comply  with  this  order
could give rise to contempt of court proceedings.


FEE  AWARD                            (Note:  this  is  not  part   of   the
decision)

I have not been asked to make a fee award.  As nearly all  the  evidence  on
which the appeal has been allowed appears to  have  been  submitted  in  the
course of the appeal proceedings, rather than prior to the decision  of  the
Secretary of State, I do not consider it would be appropriate to make a  fee
award.
