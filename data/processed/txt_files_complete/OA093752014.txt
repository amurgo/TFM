                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    Introduction

    1.     The Appellant (the Secretary of State) appealed with  permission
         granted by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Cruthers  on  11  June  2015
         against the decision  and  reasons  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
         Suffield-Thompson who had allowed the Respondent's  appeal  against
         the Entry Clearance Officer's decision dated 31 July 2014 to refuse
         to grant the Respondent leave  to  enter  the  United  Kingdom  for
         settlement as a spouse under Appendix FM of the Immigration  Rules.
         The decision and reasons was promulgated  on  30  March  2015.  The
         appeal  was  determined  on  the  papers  as  the  Respondent   had
         requested.

    2.     The Respondent is a national of Sri Lanka, born there on 18 July
         1978.  She had married her sponsor in India on 27 March  2014.   He
         holds leave to remain in the United Kingdom as a  refugee  but  the
         marriage post dated his status and so the requirements of  Appendix
         FM applied to the Respondent, not paragraph 352A of the Immigration
         Rules.  The Entry Clearance Officer refused the application because
         (a) two salary entries were missing from the sponsor's NatWest bank
         statements for the required period of 6 months and (b) the  average
         income did not meet the threshold of �18,600.  Appendix  FM-SE  was
         not satisfied.  There were  no  exceptional  circumstances  and  no
         breach of Article 8 ECHR as family life could be lived outside  the
         United Kingdom.

    3.     Judge Suffield-Thompson allowed the appeal under the Immigration
         Rules, finding that the sponsor was paid �18,700  per  annum.   The
         judge did not address Appendix FM-SE.

    4.     Permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  as  sought  by  the
         Appellant was granted by Judge Cruthers because he considered  that
         it was arguable that the judge had failed to address the  two  week
         gap in the salary deposits, in the context of the  requirements  of
         Appendix FM-SE.

    5.     Standard directions were made by the Upper Tribunal.

    Submissions - error of law

    6.     Mr Tufan for the Secretary of State submitted that  this  was  a
         clear case of legal error, as the grant of permission to appeal  by
         the  First-tier  Tribunal  indicated.  The  judge   had   evidently
         misconstrued Appendix FM-SE and so had missed an essential point in
         the refusal notice.  No relevant findings had been made.

    7.     Mr Sreekumar, the Respondent's sponsor indicated that he  wanted
         the judge's decision to be upheld.

    The error of law finding

    8.     At the conclusion of submissions, the tribunal indicated that it
         found that the judge had fallen into material error of law, for the
         reasons succinctly indicated in the grant of permission  to  appeal
         by the First-tier Tribunal.  The requirements of Appendix FM-SE are
         mandatory and the absence of the salary deposits was fatal  to  the
         application.  The decision and reasons would be set aside  and  the
         appeal reheard immediately.

    The rehearing and fresh decision

    9.     For clarity the tribunal will now refer to the parties by  their
         designations in the First-tier Tribunal.  No further  evidence  was
         required as the Appellant  had  to  have  submitted  the  specified
         evidence at the time of  the  entry  clearance  application.   That
         evidence was  incomplete.   Unfortunately  for  the  Appellant  and
         sponsor, any gap, however small, is fatal.  The tribunal finds that
         the specified evidence was incomplete.

    10.    It follows that the tribunal upholds the  Secretary  of  State's
         appeal.

    11.    There was no suggestion that the Appellant is not in a  position
         to submit a fresh and compliant entry  clearance  application.   No
         evidence of exceptional circumstances was shown.  The Appellant and
         her sponsor can live as family  in  other  places  apart  from  the
         United Kingdom with which neither has  any  real  connection.   The
         sponsor's grant of refugee status is transferrable.  Thus,  however
         the Appellant's appeal is analysed, it must fail.

    12.    There was no application for  an  anonymity  direction  and  the
         tribunal sees no need for one.

    DECISION

    The making of the previous decision involved the making of an error  on
    a point of law.  The tribunal allows the onwards appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, sets aside the original decision  and  remakes  the  original
    decision as follows:

    The appeal is dismissed




    Signed Dated


    Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Manuell






    TO THE RESPONDENT
    FEE AWARD

    As the appeal was dismissed, there can be no fee award




    Signed Dated


    Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Manuell
