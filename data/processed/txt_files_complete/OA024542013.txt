For the Appellant:     Mr Afzal, IIAS
For the Respondent: Mr Harrison, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Pakistan date  of  birth  4th  September
    1976.  She has permission to appeal against the decision of the  First-
    tier Tribunal (Judge Birrell) dated 19th December 2013 to  dismiss  her
    appeal against the Respondent's decision to refuse to grant  her  entry
    clearance as the spouse of a person present and settled in  the  United
    Kingdom.
    Background and Matters in Issue


 2. This application for entry clearance was made prior to the statement of
    changes to the rules that took  effect  on  the  9th  July  2012.   The
    Respondent's refusal dated 29th November 2012 raised only  two  issues:
    maintenance and accommodation.


 3. Before the First-tier Tribunal  the  Sponsor  Mr  Mohammad  Aslam  gave
    evidence that he received �142.70  in  pension  payments  plus  �60  in
    housing benefit.  It was common ground that the Appellant would succeed
    in her appeal if she could show, on a balance  of  probabilities,  that
    her husband's income met or exceeded the amount that they would receive
    if they were living on benefits: KA (and others) Pakistan [2006]  UKAIT
    00065.  In this respect the  Tribunal identified a 'target  figure'  of
    �111.45 plus housing costs.

 4. At paragraph 28 the Tribunal accepts the  figures  put  forward  by  Mr
    Aslam and at 29 says this: "I am therefore satisfied that  taking  into
    account the cost of accommodation the appellant cannot meet the  target
    figure set  out  in  the  refusal  letter".  The  appeal  is  therefore
    dismissed.


    Error of Law

 5. The grounds of appeal submit that the First-tier Tribunal erred in  its
    calculation of the amount that the Appellant and  her  husband  had  to
    live on. The KA target figure in this case was �111.45 plus the housing
    benefit.  It was not contested that the  Sponsor  received  �142.70  in
    pension payments plus �60 in housing  benefit,  which  met  the  entire
    costs of his rent.  At  paragraph  29  it  appears  that  the  Tribunal
    calculated the Sponsor's income by taking  his  pension  payments  then
    deducting the rent. It is submitted that this was the  wrong  approach:
    in fact the pension payment plus the housing benefit was in  excess  of
    the target figure plus  the  housing  benefit  that  the  couple  would
    receive on income support.


 6. Before me Mr Harrison agreed that this was so.  The First-tier Tribunal
    had erred in deducting the costs of housing when in  fact  that  was  a
    neutral factor in this case.


    Decision

 7. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contain an error  of  law  such
    that the decision should be set aside.


 8. I re-make the decision by allowing the appeal.

 9. There was no request for anonymity in this case and I see no reason  to
    make such a direction.
