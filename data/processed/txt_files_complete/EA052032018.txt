For the Appellant:     Mr Z Iqbal, of Greystone Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms R Bassi, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is an appeal against the decision of  Judge  of  the  First-tier
       Tribunal Herlihy (the judge), promulgated on 5 June 2019,  dismissing
       the appellant's appeal against the respondent's  decision,  dated  10
       July 2018, refusing to issue him a residence  card  pursuant  to  the
       Immigration (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006  (the  2006
       Regulations) as confirmation of his right to reside in the UK as  the
       dependant family member of an EEA national exercising Treaty rights.



Background

    2. The appellant is a national of Pakistan, born on 6 April 1986. In May
       2007, when he was 21 years  old,  the  appellant  applied  for  entry
       clearance  as  a  Tier  4  (General)  Student.  His  application  was
       supported by an affidavit from Mr Muhammad Arif, whom  the  appellant
       says is his uncle. According to the respondent  Mr  Arif's  affidavit
       stated that he would sponsor the appellant as a student and  that  he
       was providing for  the  appellant's  essential  needs.  Although  the
       application was initially refused it was eventually granted following
       an appeal and the appellant entered the  UK  in  2010  as  a  Tier  4
       (General) Student. It is not clear on the papers before me  when  the
       entry clearance expired.

    3. On 14 April 2015 the appellant applied for a residence  card  as  the
       dependent extended  family  member  of  Mr  Malik  Munshi  Khan,  his
       maternal uncle. Mr Khan is a national of Denmark who is said to  have
       entered the UK in 2015 and started working in November of that  year.
       The appellant claimed  that  Mr  Khan  provided  him  with  financial
       support to enable him to meet his essential  needs  in  Pakistan  and
       after the appellant entered the UK, and that since Mr Khan  moved  to
       the UK  in  2015  the  appellant  has  been  living  with  him.  This
       application was refused, and  an  appeal  withdrawn  following  legal
       advice given to the appellant by former  representatives.  A  further
       application was made in  2016  and,  after  a  protracted  series  of
       events, including the challenge of  judicial  review  proceedings,  a
       decision was made on 10 July refusing the application.

    4. In her decision the respondent referred to Mr  Arif's  affidavit  and
       his claim to have been providing for the appellant's essential needs.
       The respondent considered this was inconsistent with the  appellant's
       claim that Mr Khan had provided for his essential needs in  Pakistan.
       The respondent did not accept that the appellant was dependent on  Mr
       Khan, or a member of his household, prior to  entering  the  UK.  The
       respondent made no finding one way or another in respect  of  whether
       the appellant was dependent on Mr Khan  or  lived  in  his  household
       after the appellant entered the UK.  As  the  refusal  to  grant  the
       residence card was issued  pursuant  to  the  2006  Regulations,  the
       appellant had a right of appeal.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal

    5. The judge had before her  a  bundle  of  documents  provided  by  the
       appellant running to 151 pages which included, inter alia, statements
       from the appellant and Mr Khan, an affidavit from  Mr  Arif  dated  9
       July 2018, some money transfer receipts from the sponsor  in  Denmark
       to the appellant in Pakistan, two money transfer  documents  relating
       to the appellant after her arrived in the UK, fee receipts  documents
       stating that Mr Khan paid for the  appellant's  course  fees  at  two
       different colleges in the UK, and several affidavits  and  statements
       from individuals asserting that Mr  Khan  financially  supported  the
       appellant and attesting to their  character.  The  judge  heard  oral
       evidence from the appellant and Mr Khan and summarised their evidence
       at 6.1 to 6.8 of her decision, and properly directed  herself  as  to
       the requisite standard and burden of proof [4].

    6. The judge's findings are contained in section 7 of her  decision.  At
       7.3 the judge addressed her mind to the legal  test  for  determining
       dependency under the EEA Regulations. Although  Mr  Khan  claimed  in
       oral evidence that he obtained Danish nationality in 1978  the  judge
       noted the absence of any clear evidence to support this assertion.  A
       copy of Mr Khan's Danish passport showed that it was issued on 10 May
       2007. The judge noted the claim by the appellant and Mr Khan that the
       appellant's father was not working and could not  afford  to  support
       him and his family. The evidence before the judge  suggested  to  her
       that Mr Khan chose to support the appellant because  of  their  close
       relationship.

    7. At 7.4 the judge indicated that she had considered all the  oral  and
       written  evidence  and  the  written  statements  contained  in   the
       appellant's bundle, and at 7.5 the judge considered four  handwritten
       receipts issued by Money Transfer Services DNK between 18  June  2001
       and 18 April 2005. The judge  considered  these  receipts  in  detail
       noting that, over a four-year period, they amounted to an  equivalent
       of �93. The judge stated, "There was no evidence before me that  this
       was in any way sufficient to meet all the Appellant's essential needs
       in Pakistan." The judge then stated,

           "If they were remitted in Danish  Kroner  the  amount  sent  and
           amounts received do not appear to be consistent as  for  example
           the document at page 61 indicates the Appellant  is  to  receive
           2560 Pakistani rupees and the amount sent  is  expressed  to  be
           350.07. However 2560 Pakistani rupees is today the equivalent of
           120 Danish Kroner and there is a big disparity between  the  sum
           of 350.07 shown on the remittance."

    8. At 7.6 the judge noted the absence of any evidence of the income  his
       family received in Pakistan  order  to  determine  if  the  money  is
       remitted by the  sponsor  could  be  regarded  as  meeting  "all  his
       essential needs." The judge found that  the  very  small  amounts  of
       money remitted had not established that they were sufficient to  meet
       "all" of the appellant's  essential  needs.  The  judge  additionally
       stated,

           "I am not satisfied that I can place any  great  weight  on  the
           documents at pages 61 to  64  due  to  the  disparities  in  the
           documents between the sums remitted and the sums received."

    9. At  7.7  the  judge  considered  further  money  remittance  receipts
       contained in the appellant's bundle between pages 65  and  72,  which
       covered the period from 10 January 2006  to  25  November  2009.  The
       judge calculated the equivalent value of the  money  is  remitted  in
       pounds sterling and concluded that the amounts were  insufficient  to
       meet the appellant's essential needs in Pakistan.

   10. At  7.9  the  judge  considered  the  respondent's  reliance  on  the
       affidavit from Mr Mohammed Arif in respect of the appellant's Tier  4
       (General) Student application for entry clearance. The judge referred
       to a new affidavit from Mr Arif which had a date  stamp  of  19  July
       2018. The judge noted that the otherwise un-dated  affidavit  was  in
       English and that there was no evidence that Mr Arif  could  write  or
       speak English. The judge could not be certain that the affidavit  was
       read to Mr Arif in a language that he understood  and  there  was  no
       translation of the original affidavit  if  it  had  been  made  in  a
       language other than English.

   11. At 7.10,  7.11  and  7.12  the  judge  considered  two  fee  receipts
       purportedly provided by 2 separate colleges,  one  dated  8  November
       2011 and the other dated 22 April 2013. The  judge  agreed  with  the
       respondent that these were not genuinely  issued  documents  as  both
       contained a spelling mistake in respect of the  word  receipt  (spelt
       "recipt") and both were written in identical fonts of identical size.
       The judge noted that the appellant had been  unable  to  produce  any
       physical evidence other than these 2 letters of the  actual  payments
       by Mr Khan. The judge found that the 2  college  fee  receipts  casts
       serious doubt on the appellant's claim to have been dependent upon Mr
       Khan. The judge also found the appellant's claim  that  Mr  Khan  had
       been meeting "all his essential needs" to be  incredible  as  it  was
       contradicted by the appellant's Tier 4 (General) Student  application
       in which he claimed that another individual (Mr Arif) was meeting all
       his needs and would sponsor him.

   12. At 7.13 the judge  found  that  the  lack  of  any  evidence  of  the
       remittance of monies from Mr Khan to the appellant after  he  entered
       the UK in 2010 and before Mr Khan arrived in 2015  to  undermine  the
       appellant's claim to have been dependent upon Mr Khan. There were  no
       statements from any individuals who, as the  appellant  claimed,  had
       visited him in the UK and handed him money from  Mr  Khan.  The  oral
       evidence relating to how much money he  received  from  Mr  Khan  was
       vague and there was no evidence produced  by  Mr  Khan  of  his  bank
       statements from Denmark showing withdrawals from  his  account  which
       would have matched the sums  paid  to  the  appellant.  Nor  had  the
       appellant produced any copies of bank statements from  2010  to  2016
       which would have been reasonable for him to have produced had he been
       receiving significant sums of money in cash which would be  deposited
       into his account to meet its outgoings. Nor had Mr Khan produced  any
       evidence of his regular travel to the UK between 2010 and 2015.

   13. At 7.14 the judge noted that several other affidavits  provided  from
       individuals in Pakistan were in English and were undated.  There  was
       no evidence that the deponent of the affidavits were  able  to  write
       and understand what they were saying in  English  and  there  was  no
       evidence that the affidavits initially been made in another language.
       Furthermore, the writers of the affidavits did not indicate how  they
       knew that the appellant was being financially supported by  Mr  Khan.
       At 7.15 the judge considered several letters from people based in the
       UK, some of which made no mention of any dependency. Those  that  did
       talk about dependency did not disclose how the authors came  upon  or
       were aware of this information. The judge found it  likely  that  the
       statements and affidavits are prepared based on information given  by
       the appellant to the authors of those statements. At 7.16  the  judge
       did not find it credible that Mr Khan would have been able to support
       the appellant given that he also had his own family comprising a wife
       and 4 children to support. The judge additionally noted  the  absence
       of any evidence  of  money  being  transferred  by  Mr  Khan  to  the
       appellant after March 2017.

   14. At 7.17 the judge stated that there was no evidence before her as  to
       what level of income was required in order for the appellant to  meet
       his essential needs. The judge noted that the appellant did not  into
       the UK until he was 24 and that he provided no evidence  of  what  he
       did in Pakistan after finishing his schooling and  before  coming  to
       the UK. The judge did not find it credible that  the  appellant,  who
       was at the date of the hearing aged 33, had, since  the  age  of  15,
       been "entirely dependent upon the EEA sponsor who is aged 84 to  meet
       all his essential needs." The judge stated,

           "I am satisfied that  the  sponsor  has  provided  some  limited
           financial assistance to the Appellant in Pakistan but I  do  not
           find that the Appellant was dependent in Pakistan or  after  his
           arrival in the United Kingdom on his uncle the EEA  national  to
           meet all his essential needs."

   15. Finally, at 7.18 the judge again rejected the appellant's claim  that
       he was financially dependent upon Mr  Khan  "for  all  his  essential
       needs" before he came to the United Kingdom.

   16. The appeal was dismissed.

The challenge to the First-tier Tribunal's decision

   17. The grounds contend that the judge erred in law in requiring Mr  Khan
       to meet "all"  of  the  appellant's  essential  needs  and  that  the
       financial assistance provided by Mr Khan was sufficient to  meet  the
       appellant's essential needs as there was no requirement to achieve  a
       certain level of income. This assertion was supported by reference to
       the respondent's Policy Guidance  'Extended  family  members  of  EEA
       Nationals, version 7.0, published for Home Office staff on  27  March
       2019 and  the  decision  in  RK  (OFM)  -  membership  of  household-
       dependency) India [2010] UKUT 421 (IAC).

   18. The grounds also contend that it was unclear on what basis  and  from
       which source the judge arrived at the figures that  she  did  between
       7.5 and 7.7 in relation to  money  remittances.  If  the  judge  made
       calculations based on conversion rates applicable at the date of  her
       decision she failed to take into account that currency rates may have
       been very different  over  a  decade  earlier.  The  grounds  further
       contend that the judge failed to take into  account  the  appellant's
       explanation for the absence of  further  records  of  money  transfer
       receipts, as detailed in paragraph 17 of his statement.

   19. It is argued that the judge misdirected herself  in  looking  at  the
       reasons why Mr Khan  may  have  provided  financial  support  to  the
       appellant as there was no requirement to determine  the  reasons  for
       recourse to such support (with reference to  Moneke  (EEA  -  OFMs  -
       assessment of evidence)  Nigeria  [2011]  UKUT  430).  The  appellant
       further maintains that there were bank statements and  pages  hundred
       38 250 of his bundle showing not only electronic money transfers from
       Mr Khan to the appellant's account but confirming that they lived  at
       the same address. There was, in any event, no need for the  appellant
       to show that he was financially  dependent  upon  Mr  Khan  after  Mr
       Khan's arrival in the UK if the appellant was a member of  Mr  Khan's
       household. Moreover, even if there was no evidence as to when Mr Khan
       obtained Danish nationality, his passport showed that he was a Danish
       national from at least 10 May 2007, at  a  time  when  the  appellant
       still resided in Pakistan.

   20. The appellant contends that the judge engaged  in  undue  speculation
       when attaching little or no weight to  Mr  Arif's  affidavit  in  the
       absence of any evidence of Mr Arif's proficiency in English  or  that
       the statement was originally written in another language or  that  it
       was translated and read back to Mr Arif. The judge's  conclusion  was
       based on stereotyping and no doubt was placed on the bona fides of Mr
       Arif's affidavit written in 2007 which was also written  entirely  in
       English.

   21. The grounds  finally  contend  that  the  judge  reached  speculative
       findings in concluding that Mr Khan would not have  managed  to  bear
       the financial burden of looking after his wife  and  4  children  and
       supporting the appellant, and that the judge was wrong in  concluding
       that the college fee receipts were written  in  identical  fonts  and
       identical sizes.

   22. In granting permission judge of the First-tier Tribunal  M  Robertson
       stated,

           "The grounds of appeal lengthy and whilst all  grounds  are  not
           equally arguable, there is arguable  merit  in  the  grounds  of
           paragraphs 2-8, in that the judge has repeatedly relied  on  the
           Appellant failing to establish that  his  uncle's  contributions
           had met all  his  essential  needs.  It  is  arguable  that,  in
           establishing prior dependency, the Appellant does  not  need  to
           establish that all his essential needs  were  met  by  Mr  Khan.
           Although it is stated in the grounds  that  the  judge  accepted
           that the Appellant has been residing with  Mr  Khanna  since  he
           came to the UK, but no finding of fact appears to have been made
           on this issue, although it is a matter that the  judge  arguably
           should  have  considered  in  the  absence  of  a   finding   of
           dependency.  As  permission  is  granted  on  this  ground,  the
           Appellant is permitted to rely on all grounds."

   23. In his oral submissions Mr Iqbal submitted that there  are  had  only
       been one issue before  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  that  being  prior
       dependency. Present dependency had not been raised by the  respondent
       as an issue in her decision. Mr Iqbal relied on the  written  grounds
       and reiterated that the judge failed to identify  how  she  made  her
       calculations at 7.5 to 7.7. of her decision and that  she  failed  to
       engage with the explanation given by the appellant for the absence of
       any other documentary evidence  of  money  remittals.  There  was  no
       evidence before the judge that  Mr  Arif's  statement  had  not  been
       translated to him or that he had not understood what was contained in
       the statement, and the same applied  to  the  other  individuals  who
       provided affidavits from Pakistan.

   24. Ms Bassi submitted that the judge had not erred in law  by  referring
       to Mr Khan meeting "all" of the appellant's essential needs and  drew
       my attention to the appellant's statement at  paragraph  21  when  he
       stated that he was dependent on the money that Mr Khan sent  him  and
       that "the money met all of my basic needs." If the was any  error  by
       the judge it was not material  as  she  had  considered  all  of  the
       documents before her (she stated at 7.15) and even if she  was  wrong
       in respect of her currency conversion  calculations  this  would  not
       have made any material difference. The judge  was  entitled  to  take
       into account the 2007 affidavit from Mr Arif and to  find  that  this
       was  inconsistent  with  the  appellant's  claim  that  he  had  been
       dependent upon Mr Khan. The judge had been entitled to find both  the
       appellant and Mr Khan incredible and the was, in any event, a gap  of
       financial support provided by Mr Khan between 2010 and 2015. Ms Bassi
       acknowledged that the refusal letter didn't deal with  the  issue  of
       present dependency  but  submitted  that  the  appellant  could  only
       succeed in his appeal if he was able to demonstrate the existence  of
       past dependency. She invited me to dismiss the appeal.

   25. I reserved my decision.

Discussion

   26. On the facts of this appeal the relevant conditions are contained  in
       Reg 8(2). This reads, in material part,

           'A person satisfies the  condition  in  this  paragraph  if  the
           person is a relative of an EEA national, his spouse or his civil
           partner and -

             a) The person is residing in a country other  than  the  United
                Kingdom ... and is dependent upon the EEA national or  is  a
                member of his household;

             b) The person satisfied the condition in paragraph (a)  and  is
                accompanying the EEA  national  to  the  United  Kingdom  or
                wishes to join him there; or

             c) The person satisfies the condition  in  paragraph  (a),  has
                joined the EEA national in the United Kingdom and  continues
                to  be  dependent  upon  him  or  to  be  a  member  of  his
                household.'

   27. Dependency on the EEA sponsor and membership  of  the  EEA  sponsor's
       household are alternative routes under Reg 8(2)(c) (see, for example,
       Moneke (EEA - OFMs) Nigeria [2011] UKUT 341 (IAC)). In  Lim  v  Entry
       Clearance Officer Manila [2015] EWCA Civ 1383  the  Court  of  Appeal
       stated, at [32],

           "In my judgment, the critical question is whether  the  claimant
           is in fact in a position to support himself or  not,  and  Reyes
           now makes that clear beyond doubt, in my view. That is a  simple
           matter  of  fact.  If  he  can  support  himself,  there  is  no
           dependency, even if he is given financial  material  support  by
           the EU citizen. Those additional resources are not necessary  to
           enable him to meet his basic needs. If, on the  other  hand,  he
           cannot support himself from his own resources,  the  court  will
           not ask why that is the case, save perhaps  where  there  is  an
           abuse of rights. The fact that he chooses not to get a  job  and
           become self-supporting is irrelevant."

   28. Although the judge  properly  directed  herself  in  respect  of  the
       relevant legal test at 7.3, her assessment at 7.5,  7.6,  7.12,  7.17
       and 7.18. refers to the funds provided by Mr Khan as being  necessary
       to meet "all" the appellant's essential needs. There  is  however  no
       requirement that Mr Khan provides funds to enable  the  appellant  to
       meet "all" his essential needs. The relevant case law indicates  that
       the support that Mr Khan provides only  needs  to  be  'material'  or
       'necessary' to enable the appellant to meet his essential needs  (see
       Lim, at [25] &  [32];  see  also  the  respondent's  Policy  Guidance
       'Extended family members of EEA Nationals, version 7.0, published for
       Home Office staff on 27 March 2019, which states, "The applicant does
       not need to be dependent on the EEA national to meet all or  most  of
       their essential  needs.  For  example,  an  applicant  is  considered
       dependent if they receive  a  pension  which  covers  half  of  their
       essential needs and money  from  their  EEA  national  sponsor  which
       covers the other half."). To this extent the  judge  has  misdirected
       herself. Given the frequency with which she refers to the need for Mr
       Khan's funds being necessary to meet "all" the appellant's  essential
       needs, I find this misdirection to be material.

   29. I am additionally satisfied that, despite the appellant  offering  an
       explanation for  the  absence  of  money  transfer  receipts  in  his
       statement (at paragraph 17 the appellant stated, "as support has been
       on-going for years we do not have all records. I did not keep all the
       receipts as I did  not  realise  that  I  would  need  them.  I  have
       destroyed or misplaced many of the receipts and the ones I  have  are
       enclosed."). This explanation was, prima facie, plausible. The  judge
       failed to engage with  this  explanation  or  make  any  findings  in
       relation to the explanation. Whilst the judge was  entitled  to  find
       that the appellant and Mr Khan were incredible witnesses in  relation
       to their claim that Mr Khan sent money to the appellant when he  came
       to the UK, and whilst the judge gave sustainable reasons for  finding
       that the receipts from the 2 colleges were not genuine documents,  it
       does not necessary follow that the  judge  would  have  rejected  the
       explanation at paragraph 17 of the appellant's statement. It at least
       required some consideration by the judge. I  am  satisfied  that  the
       judge failed to take into account a relevant consideration  when  she
       failed to engage with the appellant's explanation.

   30. I am additionally concerned with the judge's findings at 7.5 and  7.6
       relating to a "big disparity" between the Pakistani rupee  equivalent
       of converted kroner detailed in money transfer receipts covering  the
       period 2001 to 2005. At 7.5 the judge found that  the  350.07  Kroner
       detailed in a money transfer receipt dated 18 June 2001 converted  to
       2560 Pakistani rupees, but that 2560 Pakistani rupees "...  is  today
       the equivalent of 120 Danish Kroner and  there  is  a  big  disparity
       between the sum of 350.07 shown on the remittance." It is  not  clear
       why the judge decided to convert 2560 Pakistani rupees into Kroner at
       the time that she made her decision in 2019  rather  than  using  the
       conversion rate on 18 June 2001. Having obtained the consent  of  the
       parties I visited the  oanda.com  currency  converter  website  which
       enables one to access historical  conversion  rates.  The  amount  of
       350.07 Danish Kroner converted to 2,558.87  Pakistani  rupees  on  18
       June 2001. This is substantially the same  as  the  converted  amount
       detailed in the money transfer receipt at page 61 of the  appellant's
       bundle. To the extent that the judge considered that  she  could  not
       "place any great weight on the documents at pages 61 to 64 due to the
       disparities in the documents between the sums limited  and  the  sums
       received", she has attached weight  to  an  irrelevant  matter.  This
       constitutes an error of law.

   31. At 7.5 the judge found that the monies remitted by  Mr  Khan  to  the
       appellant over the four-year period 2001 to 2005, as disclosed in the
       4 money transfer receipts, amounted to the  equivalent  of  �93.  The
       judge does not identify the conversion date that she used in reaching
       this calculation. Using the oanda.com website  refer  to  above,  and
       using the conversion dates identified in each of the  money  transfer
       receipts, the amount remitted by Mr Khan  amounted  to  �169.  Whilst
       this is still a small amount, and whilst the  judge  may  still  have
       been entitled to conclude that  it  was  insufficient  to  materially
       enable the appellants to meet his essential needs, I am not persuaded
       that she would have been bound to reach this  conclusion,  especially
       if the appellant's explanation for the absence of any  further  money
       remittance receipts had been considered.

   32. For similar reasons I am persuaded that the judge's  calculations  at
       7.7 of her decision also discloses and error of law because the judge
       appears to have used a  conversion  rate  from  Pakistani  rupees  to
       pounds Sterling at the time that she wrote her decision.  She  states
       that Mr Khan remitted sums equivalent to �27 and �43 in 2007, but the
       oanda.com website for the specific  dates  identified  in  the  money
       transfer receipts amounted to �47 and  �72  respectively.  There  are
       similar disparities between the remaining equivalent  figures  stated
       by the judge and the figures that result  from  using  the  oanda.com
       conversion website. The actual equivalent in pounds sterling  at  the
       date of the money transfers is, in some  cases,  almost  double  that
       relied on by the judge. In relying on a currency conversion date when
       she wrote the decision rather than  the  date  of  the  actual  money
       transfers the judge took into account an irrelevant consideration.

   33. I am additionally persuaded that the judge's finding at 7.16  -  that
       it was not credible that Mr Khan would have  provided  the  appellant
       with funds in order for him to meet his essential needs  in  addition
       to meeting the needs of his own family - was unduly speculative.  The
       judge provided no other reasons  for  this  conclusion  and  did  not
       identify any particular evidence supportive of this conclusion.

   34. I am not persuaded that the judge erred in law in attaching little or
       no weight to the 2018 affidavit from Mr Arif. The judge was  entitled
       to take into account the absence of any evidence that Mr  Arif  spoke
       would read or understand English and the absence of any evidence that
       the affidavit was translated to  Mr  Arif  and  the  absence  of  any
       evidence that  the  affidavit  was  originally  composed  in  another
       language and subsequently translated. This was a decision  rationally
       open to the judge for the reasons given. Nor am I persuaded that  the
       judge erred in law in concluding that the college fee  receipts  were
       unlikely to contain the same spelling mistake and that the term  "Fee
       Receipt" was in identical script and size. Having considered the  two
       separate documents myself  I  am  satisfied  that  was  a  conclusion
       reasonably open to the judge.

   35. Ms Bassi submits that the appeal stood to be  refused  in  any  event
       because the judge rejected the appellant's claim that Mr Khan's funds
       were necessary for him to meet his essential needs,  that  the  judge
       was entitled to her findings for the reasons given,  and  that  there
       was therefore a five-year gap between the appellant entering  the  UK
       in 2010 and Mr Khan arriving in 2015, at  which  time  the  appellant
       became a member  of  Mr  Khan's  household.  Ms  Bassi  supports  her
       contention by reference to KG and AK v SSHD [2008] EWCA  Civ  13  (at
       [79]), MR (EEA extended family members) Bangladesh  [2010]  UKUT  449
       (at [17(ii)]), and the decision of the Grand Chamber in SSHD v Rahman
       (Case C-83/11). Whilst I accept that these authorities  provide  some
       (although not conclusive) support  for  the  respondent's  submission
       that a significant break in the continuity of dependency prevents the
       appellant from being regarded as an extended family member,  this  is
       premised on the findings of fact relating to the period between  2010
       and 2015 being retained. Although I have not been persuaded that some
       of the judge's factual findings, including some  adverse  credibility
       findings, were not open to her, I have found that she did  materially
       err in law in relation to other findings, including those relating to
       the credibility of the appellant and Mr Khan (detailed in  paragraphs
       28 to 33 above). For these reasons I find that the identified  errors
       of law undermine sustainability of all the judge's findings.

   36. Given the nature of the errors of law identified and their impact  on
       the judge's factual  findings,  I  consider  it  appropriate,  having
       regard to the relevant practice direction, to remit the appeal to the
       First-tier Tribunal for a fresh hearing.  No  doubt  the  next  judge
       hearing the appeal will reach a view on  the  respondent's  arguments
       relating to the potential gap in the continuity of dependency between
       2010 and 2015, dependent on his or her factual findings.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains an error on a point of  law
and is set aside.

The case is remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal for  a  fresh  hearing,
to be determined by a judge other than  judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
Herlihy.
