basis
For the Respondent:    Mr T. Wilding, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1.     The resumed hearing of this appeal came before me for hearing on
    23 February 2018, following a previous hearing, which took place  on  9
    October 2017. In a decision and reasons dated 15 November 2017, I found
    material errors of law in the decision of  First  tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Paul and adjourned the appeal for a resumed hearing.  A  copy  of  that
    decision is appended.

    2.     The Appellant gave evidence and adopted his witness statement of
    10 February 2018. He gave evidence to the effect that in respect of his
    application made in 2010, a blank copy of which was  contained  in  the
    Appellant's bundle, that at D10 and D11 he would have  stated  that  he
    overstayed and given his  reasons  viz  the  delay  in  obtaining  bank
    statements. He also made reference to page 54 of the bundle,  which  is
    an extract from the Subject Access  Request  dated  17  November  2017,
    which states that his application of 1 July 2010 could not located  but
    caseworking notes show that an extension  of  leave  was  granted..  He
    confirmed that since he arrived in the United Kingdom on 6 August  2005
    there were no periods when he was here unlawfully.

    3.     In cross-examination by Mr  Wilding,  the  Appellant  was  asked
    about his wider family in the UK viz aunts  and  uncles.  He  confirmed
    that he continued to live in Ilford and that he is a tenant  and  rents
    one room in a shared house. He said that in Pakistan he has his  mother
    and two brothers plus a further brother in Dubai. He was  asked  if  he
    went back to Pakistan whether he could go and live with his mother,  to
    which he replied that he has been in  the  United  Kingdom  for  twelve
    years and it would be very difficult to integrate back  home.  He  said
    that he worked in as  a  security  officer  at  Asda  in  Basildon  and
    sometimes in Tesco as part of the on-site security for the distribution
    centre.

    4.     The Appellant confirmed that he had studied in the UK.  He  said
    that he had graduated with a BA in Economics in Pakistan and applied to
    come to the UK for higher education. He completed an  MBA  in  the  UK.
    Whilst he had worked for three years in security, prior to that he  did
    bookkeeping and office work for a year. He confirmed that  in  2010  he
    was studying for his MBA and working at the accountancy firm.

    5.     There was no re-examination.

    6.     In his submissions, Mr Wilding submitted that the difficulty the
    Appellant has with establishing a paragraph 276B case is that there was
    a period of time of 65 days when he did not have any leave as a  result
    of the fact that his section 3C leave expired on 22  May  2010  and  he
    only made the application for further leave on 1 July 2010,  which  was
    decided on 22 July 2010. He submitted that, contrary to the Appellant's
    assertion, the Respondent did consider her  long  residence  policy  at
    pages 4 and 5 of the decision refusing to grant ILR  on  the  basis  of
    long residence but chose not to exercise discretion in the  Appellant's
    favour. He  submitted  that  it  is  clear  that  continuous  residence
    requires just that and that if one falls outside the permitted  28  day
    period one has no leave. Given that the period of overstay was  for  60
    days this does not assist the Appellant.

    7.     Mr Wilding submitted that it is clear from the  judgment  in  AG
    (Kosovo)  [2007]  UKAIT  00082  that  the  Tribunal   cannot   exercise
    discretion  on  the  Respondent's  behalf.  He   submitted   that   the
    Appellant's case under Article 8 falls completely outside the Rules for
    consideration, given that the Appellant was not advancing a case  under
    paragraph 276ADE(vi) of the Rules. He further submitted  that  pursuant
    to section 3C(4) of the Immigration Act 1971 the Appellant  cannot  use
    such leave as  the  starting  point  to  make  a  further  application,
    consequently the Appellant has not  been  lawfully  resident  since  18
    August 2015.

    8.     Mr Wilding accepted that the Appellant has engaged Article 8  in
    that he has established a private life in the United Kingdom,  however,
    the issue is whether it would proportionate to  expect  him  to  leave.
    Whilst the Appellant's positive case is based on  his  long  residence,
    which was mainly lawful and that there is a "near miss" in  respect  of
    qualifying under the Rules for long residence, the Appellant  does  not
    put forward a case that  he  cannot  return  to  Pakistan.  He  further
    submitted that a near miss is as good  as  a  mile  in  proportionality
    terms cf. AG (Kosovo) (op cit) at [46] onwards. He submitted  that  the
    public interest weighs against the Appellant; that his leave has always
    been precarious and the Respondent's decision is clearly proportionate.



    9.     In his submissions, Mr Coleman drew attention to page 30 of  the
    previous Appellant's bundle  before  the  First  tier  Tribunal,  which
    states that his leave under Tier 1 Post Study  leave  continues  whilst
    his current appeal is outstanding. He also drew my attention to page 62
    of the  current  bundle  and  the  fact  that  the  case  minute  notes
    considered the period of 1 June 2010- 1 July 2010  and  the  caseworker
    must  have  been  satisfied  that  exceptional  circumstances   existed
    otherwise s/he would have looked at a longer period if the  application
    was out of time e.g. 9 months. The parties then considered  Appendix  C
    of the Immigration Rules covering  the  relevant  period  in  2010.  Mr
    Wilding submitted that the level of  funds  in  a  Tier  4  application
    depended on where the Appellant was studying and if  it  was  in  Inner
    London, the funds would need to cover the  fees  plus  ï¿½1000  for  each
    month of the course up to 9 months. This was changed in July  2011  and
    where an Appellant has an established presence  he  need  only  provide
    evidence up to 2 months. He submitted that the Appellant's visa was not
    back-dated to cover the period when he did not have leave. However,  he
    submitted that this cannot go to consideration  of  discretion  and  at
    best it goes to the question of proportionality which  still  has  this
    gap. He accepted, however, that the case minutes do  not  give  clarity
    one way or another and one can only guess what was being considered  in
    respect of [11] of  Appendix  C  and  the  table  therein.  Mr  Wilding
    subsequently accepted, upon the consideration by  the  parties  of  the
    Rules in force at the date of the application made on 1 July 2010, that
    whoever considered that application accepted that  the  Appellant  only
    needed to show 2 months worth of funds. Thus he was implicitly accepted
    as a person with an established presence.

    10.    In his submissions, Mr Coleman invited me to consider  the  2010
    version of  the  Rules  and  Appendix  C.  He  submitted  that  it  was
    absolutely clear that he filled in section D on the application form in
    July 2010 and gave exceptional circumstances and provided reasons as to
    why he has overstayed. The Appellant has provided reasons  today  about
    his inability to provide bank  statements  and  difficulties  with  his
    solicitors. He submitted that the case record sheet at AB  62  and  the
    amount of money which was considered caused him  to  believe  that  the
    Appellant was treated as somebody who had applied  in  time,  thus  the
    decision maker must have accepted his reasons. More significantly  than
    that, Mr Coleman submitted that this is  not  a  case  where  the  Home
    Office policy had been considered. Whilst page 4 of the refusal  letter
    asserts that no exceptional evidence has been provided  in  support  of
    the Appellant's out of time application, this is not the  case  if  one
    considers D11 and the Appellant's oral evidence as to what he  did.  He
    submitted that there was no reason to doubt this. The Appellant had  to
    provide reasons at D11 because it is mandatory. It was  incumbent  upon
    the decision maker in  2015  to  look  back  at  the  reasons  why  the
    application in 2010 was made late, however, the decision maker was  not
    able to do that because the form and the evidence have been lost by the
    Home Office.

    11.    Mr Coleman further submitted that  the  Home  Office  must  have
    looked at  the  case  minute  note  and  should  have  looked  at  2010
    application when considering the ILR application and essentially should
    have been alive to the issue. He submitted that it would be appropriate
    to allow the appeal on the basis that the Respondent would be  required
    to make a fresh decision cf. AG (Kosovo) (op cit) at [43] and [44]  and
    Greenwood (No 2) [2015] UKUT 00059 (IAC). He declined to make  separate
    submissions on private life, except as to say that that on  balance  it
    is apparent that the Appellant had a short gap,  however,  he  provided
    exceptional evidence as to the reasons for the  short  gap  which  were
    accepted at the time, but the current decision maker was  blind  to  it
    and did not  apply  a  policy  that  was  directly  applicable  to  the
    Appellant nor consider exceptional circumstances.  Mr  Coleman  further
    submitted that it is apparent the Appellant  was  not  required  to  go
    above and beyond what someone applying in time is required  to  do  and
    that the Respondent should not resile from position she took  in  2010,
    when she accepted his  application  was  out  of  time  so  effectively
    exercised her discretion.

    12.    I permitted Mr Wilding to respond on the issue of Greenwood No 2
    (op cit) which he submitted had been wrongly decided in light of the as
    yet unreported Presidential decision in  Charles  HU/00561/2015,  where
    the Upper Tribunal found that the failure to exercise discretion should
    be considered through the prism of proportionality as there is no power
    any longer to find a decision not in accordance with the law.

    My findings

    13.    I first consider the Immigration Rules in force at the  date  of
    the Appellant's out of time application for further leave,  made  on  1
    July 2010. It is clear from the Rules in force at that  time  that  the
    maintenance funds required were ï¿½1600 i.e. 2  months  at  ï¿½800.  It  is
    consequently clear  from  the  GCID  case  record  sheet,  which  makes
    reference to monthly living costs  of  ï¿½1600  that  the  Appellant  was
    treated at the date of his application for leave, considered on 5  July
    2010,  as  a  person  with  an  established  presence  and  not  as  an
    overstayer. This is despite the fact that at AB 60 the  application  is
    recorded as having been validly made but "OOT" which  I  understand  to
    mean "out of time." My view is further supported by the fact that AB 61
    the notes record that the Appellant's  course  was  due  to  finish  on
    23.12.2010, therefore, he had over 5 months left to run at the date  of
    consideration.

    14.    I  have  further  considered  the  Appellant's  application  and
    covering letter made on 10 August 2015, which gave rise to the decision
    under appeal, however neither the letter nor application form raise the
    issue of exceptional circumstances in respect of the  2010  application
    but  rather  assert  that  the  Appellant  has  been  lawfully  present
    throughout.

    15.    I turn to the decision of 10 August 2015. I find that at pages 3-
    4 the Respondent  did  expressly  consider  her  published  "Modernised
    Guidance: Long Residence and Private Ties" in respect of  the  exercise
    of discretion where continuous  leave  has  been  broken,  however,  no
    reference is made therein to the category contained in the guidance viz
    "an inability to provide necessary documents" and the decision  asserts
    that "no exceptional evidence has been provided in support of your  out
    of time application therefore it is considered it is not appropriate to
    exercise discretion."

    16.    I find that the Respondent's consideration of whether or not  to
    exercise  discretion  pursuant  to  her  Long  residence  guidance  was
    insufficient, both for the reasons set out at [15] above,  and  due  to
    the fact that the Appellant's application made on 1 July 2010 has  been
    lost (by the Home Office) and no consideration  appears  to  have  been
    given to the GCID  casenotes,  which  are  of  course  taken  from  the
    Appellant's file held by the Home Office.

    17.    The issue is what impact my finding has on the  outcome  of  the
    appeal. On the one hand, in a  decision  of  the  former  President  in
    Greenwood (No.2)  [2015] UKUT 00059 (IAC) it is suggested at  [21]  and
    [23] that if a decision made by the Respondent  is  not  in  accordance
    with the law  then  a  lawful  decision  remains  to  be  made  by  the
    Respondent. On the other hand, the current President, Mr Justice  Lane,
    has held in the now reported decision  in  Charles  [2018]  UKUT  00089
    (IAC) that any failure by the Respondent to act in accordance with  the
    law should, since the amendments to appeal  rights  introduced  by  the
    Immigration  Act   2014,   be   considered   through   the   prism   of
    proportionality pursuant to a section 82 human rights appeal.

    18.    I have no hesitation in following the recent  and  now  reported
    decision of the  current  President  in  Charles  as  representing  the
    correct position in law. Mr Wilding accepted  that  the  Appellant  had
    established a private life over the previous twelve and a  half  years.
    Applying Lord Bingham's five stage test as set  out  in  Razgar  [2004]
    UKHL 27 at [17] I find that the proposed removal of the Appellant as  a
    consequence of the Respondent's negative decision would  constitute  an
    interference by a public authority with the exercise of  his  right  to
    respect for his private  life;  it  would  have  consequences  of  such
    gravity as potentially to engage the operation of article 8; it  is  in
    accordance with the law (following Charles at [58] and necessary  in  a
    democratic society. The question is whether such interference would  be
    proportionate.

    19.    I have taken into account the public interest as encapsulated in
    section 117B of the NIAA 2002 and make the following findings: (i)  the
    Appellant speaks English, he gave  his  evidence  in  English  and  has
    resided continuously in the  United  Kingdom  for  over  12  years  and
    studied for an MBA in English;  (ii)  he  is  financially  independent,
    having worked throughout and is able to pay rent and  support  himself;
    (iii) his private life has been developed through lawful  residence  in
    the United Kingdom (apart from the short period of  overstay  in  2015)
    but (iv) was developed whilst his immigration status was precarious, in
    that whilst the Appellant may well have hoped to qualify for settlement
    on the basis of ten years lawful continuous residence, the fact remains
    is that he did not qualify for settlement until at the earliest  August
    2015.

    20.    In light of the  public  interest  considerations  and  for  the
    reasons set out at [15] and [16] above, I  find  that  removal  of  the
    Appellant would not be proportionate in the particular circumstances of
    his case.

    21.    It follows that the appeal is allowed, on human  rights  grounds
    (Article 8).
