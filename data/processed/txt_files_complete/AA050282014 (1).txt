Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, WA, date of birth 20.3.96, is a citizen of  Afghanistan.



 2. This is his appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Sullivan promulgated 12.11.15, dismissing on  all  grounds  his  appeal
    against the decision of the Secretary of State, dated 3.7.14, to refuse
    his asylum, humanitarian protection and  human  rights  claims  and  to
    remove him from the UK.  The  Judge  heard  the  appeal  on  26.8.15  &
    22.10.15.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Ford granted permission to appeal on 7.12.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 2.2.16 as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the decision of Judge Sullivan should be set aside.

 6. At �81 in what was the conclusion of a careful and detailed analysis of
    the evidence, the First-tier Tribunal Judge was not satisfied that  the
    appellant's medical condition or symptoms are so serious as  to  breach
    the high threshold of article 3, were he to be returned to Afghanistan,
    stating  "Given  the  evidence  I  am  not  satisfied  that  there  are
    substantial grounds for believing that the impact of the removal on the
    appellant's health would be sufficiently serious to breach article 3."

 7. With regard to the "more finely balanced" article 8 assessment  at  �87
    of the decision, although she was satisfied that the appellant's health
    would deteriorate with the interruption of care if removed from the UK,
    the judge concluded, "I am not satisfied that the  deterioration  which
    will flow from the interruption of healthcare and  social  support  and
    from removal from Mr Aybi's household is  sufficient  to  outweigh  the
    public interest in the appellant's removal."

 8. In summary, the grounds challenge the judge's reliance  on  an  earlier
    period of the medical records, and on the judge's own assessment at �81
    that none of the three incidents of self-harm  amounted  to  a  serious
    attempt at suicide, as an indication of the appellant's  mental  health
    on return to Afghanistan.

 9. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Ford  found  it  arguable  that
    Judge Sullivan may have erred in assessing the risk  to  the  appellant
    arising from the lack of mental health treatment in Afghanistan, on the
    basis that the appellant either did not have or  did  not  seek  mental
    health treatment in the period December 2013 to December 2014  and  did
    not appear to have encountered difficulties as a result. "In using this
    as a yardstick as to how he would cope without treatment or support  on
    his return it is arguable that the Tribunal may  have  erred.  This  is
    because it did not take adequate account of the medical evidence of the
    marked deterioration in the appellant's mental  health  (including  the
    increased risk of suicide) after that period and did not focus  on  the
    risk to the appellant as at the date of hearing (paragraphs  70  to  73
    and 81). There is an arguable material error of law."

10. The Rule 24 reply, dated 15.12.15, submitted that the judge  made  very
    clear findings of fact in respect  of  the  appellant's  mental  health
    properly taking into account the expert's medical reports.  "The  judge
    gave adequate reasons at paragraph 81 as to why Article 3 would not  be
    breached if the appellant was removed from the UK."

11. The decision is challenged in relation to the treatment of both article
    3 and article 8. In essence, the issue before me was whether the  judge
    accurately and properly  addressed  the  evidence  of  the  appellant's
    mental health, Ms Watterson submitting that she did not  and  that  the
    failure to do so fundamentally  undermined  the  decision  so  that  it
    cannot stand.

12. It is clear that the  judge  made  a  careful  assessment  of  all  the
    relevant available evidence. The medical notes are summarised  in  some
    detail at �68 and the expert report of Dr Pannu is summarised  at  �69,
    including the features that the appellant requires ongoing  psychiatric
    treatment and there is an ongoing suicide  risk,  which  compounded  or
    mitigated by a number  of  factors.  At  �72  the  judge  detailed  the
    accounts of three alleged attempts at self-harm.

13. The appellant has been diagnosed with severe depressive  disorder  with
    psychotic symptoms, but evidently of a severity insufficient to require
    detention for medical treatment in hospital under the Mental Health Act
    1983. Dr Pannu's summary suggests that his  deterioration  in  2015  is
    likely to have followed a failure to remain concordant with  prescribed
    anti-depressant and anti-psychotic  medication.   The  letter  from  Dr
    Spirling, dated 6.10.15, states, "Unfortunately, Mr WA's mental  health
    is currently very poor. I would be concerned that  should  he  have  to
    return to Afghanistan at the present time or in  the  immediate  future
    that his mental health would deteriorate further and currently I do not
    believe he is in a fit state to return to Afghanistan."  With  respect,
    whether or not he is in a  fit  state  to  return  to  Afghanistan  and
    whether or not his mental health might deteriorate, does  not  directly
    address the high threshold of risk required under article 3, which  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge was required to assess.

14. I agree that the comparison with an earlier period was flawed,  because
    the Tribunal was obliged to consider the appellant's health at the date
    of the hearing and the evidence detailed what is said to  have  been  a
    serious deterioration in his mental health in 2015, as set out at  �4.1
    of Dr Pannu's report. However, in making an overall assessment  of  the
    evidence, the judge was entitled to have regard to that earlier period.
    I find that whilst the  judge  referenced  this  earlier  period,  that
    reference was not the sole basis  of  the  judge's  assessment  of  the
    evidence in relation to risk of suicide.

15. I also agree with the submission  that  the  implied  criticism  of  Ms
    Stevenson contained within �72, where the judge found it  difficult  to
    understand why she would request additional medication if she  believed
    he represented a real suicide risk, suggesting that Ms Stevenson  could
    not have regarded him as such a risk, is unjustified  and  inconsistent
    with the medical notes, which shows she checked with  the  GP  and  the
    pharmacist as to whether the medication had been dispensed.

16. It is submitted in the grounds that in rejecting or "trivialising"  the
    doctors' assessment of risk of suicide on the basis of the judge's  own
    non-expert opinion that  none  of  the  three  incidents  of  self-harm
    amounted to a serious attempt at suicide, the judge fell into the error
    identified by the Court of Appeal in Y (Sri Lanka) v SSHD  [2009]  EWCA
    Civ 362, in which it was stated that whilst no  Tribunal  is  bound  to
    accept everything experts say because they have gone uncontradicted, it
    is well established  that  the  Tribunal  must  have,  and  must  give,
    acceptable reasons for  rejecting  such  evidence.  In  that  case  the
    immigration judge formed the view that  the  appellants  (who  had  not
    given oral evidence) had been calculatedly  exaggerating  the  symptoms
    recounted to the expert witnesses. "That is in  the  first  instance  a
    matter for the  experts  themselves,  a  fundamental  aspect  of  whose
    expertise is the evaluation of patients' accounts of  their  symptoms."
    In fact, the evidence  detailed  a  fourth  attempt  at  self-harm  not
    mentioned by the judge, when the appellant was caught with a  ligature,
    attempting to hang himself. It is submitted that the  suicide  attempts
    began in June 2015 but he had been ruminating about ending his life for
    a long time prior to that. It is pointed out in ground  three  that  Dr
    Pannu's opinion is corroborated by that of other health professionals.

17. I accept the submission that it  is  not  for  the  judge  to  make  an
    assessment as to whether any of the  attempts  amounted  to  a  serious
    attempt at suicide; that is the preserve of the expert. However, it was
    proper for the judge to rely on the limited extent of some of the self-
    harming incidents. For example, the entry for 11.8.15  notes  that  the
    appellant saw no point in living, "but has no intention to do  anything
    stupid and would not commit suicide." The  entry  for  13.8.15  details
    that he tried to set  fire  to  himself,  "only  small  patch  and  not
    serious, but still an attempt." At  3.18  of  Dr  Pannu's  report,  the
    appellant claimed that  he  denied  himself  food  and  taken  all  his
    medication because he felt unable  to  cope.  "...  He  had  considered
    making another attempt on his life but would only  do  so  if  he  felt
    there was no improvement in his circumstances or health." At  3.20  the
    appellant told Dr Pannu that "his current functioning and feelings were
    causing him to feel that he was better off dead. He noted  that  if  it
    continued to be this difficult then he would consider suicide."

18. Undoubtedly, the evidence points to a risk of suicide  but,  obviously,
    none of the expert or medical evidence  addresses  the  high  threshold
    necessary to reach the article 3 threshold, as discussed below.

19. In ground four, reliance is also placed on J v  SSHD  [2005]  EWCA  Civ
    629, and the six factors of the  guidance  in  assessing  the  risk  of
    suicide on return.  The risk must be serious and  there  has  to  be  a
    direct causal link between the act or threatened act of removal and the
    risk of suicide. The threshold is particularly high in a  foreign  case
    and even higher where the alleged inhuman treatment is not  the  direct
    or indirect responsibility of the public authorities of  the  receiving
    state, but results  from  some  naturally  occurring  illness,  whether
    physical or mental.

20. The sixth question, relied on by Ms Watterson, is whether the  removing
    or the receiving state has effective mechanisms to reduce the  risk  of
    suicide, if so, that will weigh heavily against  an  applicant's  claim
    that removal will violate his  article  3  rights.  The  mental  health
    facilities in Afghanistan are no more than  basic  and  Judge  Sullivan
    accepted at �81 that care facilities are "insufficient for the needs of
    the population," though she considered that he would have family and/or
    social support on return.

21. The case law has long accepted that in principle, the risk  of  suicide
    can engage article 3, suicide being a type of  serious  harm.  However,
    the threshold for a risk of suicide to satisfy article 3 is very  high.
    The evidence has to  establish  that  there  are  "strong  grounds  for
    believing" that removal would expose a  person  to  a  "real  risk"  of
    committing suicide on return. In N  (Kenya)  [2004]  UKIAT  00053,  the
    Tribunal acknowledged that prospective suicide by reason of removal  is
    capable of engaging both Articles 3 and 8,  but  concluded  that  there
    would need to be the "clearest possible evidence" of a "real risk" that
    this  would  occur  which  would  not  otherwise  be   preventable   by
    appropriate medical supervision  both  on  the  part  of  the  removing
    country and having regard  to  facilities  which  might  reasonably  be
    expected to exist in the country of destination.

22. On appeal to the European Court of Human Rights in N v  UK  Application
    26565/05, a case involving HIV the Grand Chamber upheld the decision of
    the House of Lords and said  that  in  medical  cases  Article  3  only
    applied  in  "very  exceptional  circumstances"  particularly  as   the
    suffering was not the result of an intentional act  or  omission  of  a
    State or non State body. Article 3 could not be relied  on  to  address
    the disparity in  medical  care  between  Contracting  States  and  the
    applicant's state of origin.  The fact that the person's circumstances,
    including his or her life expectancy, would  be  significantly  reduced
    was not sufficient in itself to give rise to a  breach  of  Article  3.
    Those same principles had to apply in relation to the expulsion of  any
    person afflicted with any  serious,  naturally  occurring  physical  or
    mental illness  which  might  cause  suffering  pain  or  reduced  life
    expectancy and required specialist medical treatment that might not  be
    readily available or which might  only  be  available  at  considerable
    cost.

23. In MK (Pakistan) [2005] UKIAT 00075 the Tribunal noted N and said  that
    the circumstances in which facts could lawfully be held  to  involve  a
    breach of Article 3 in cases like this had to be not  just  exceptional
    but extreme so as to engage very strong, indeed compelling humanitarian
    considerations. MK was a case in which neither the  Appellant  nor  his
    family could afford medication and there was a  serious  risk  that  he
    would commit suicide within a very short period if returned  due  to  a
    deterioration in his mental condition.  His life  expectancy  would  be
    considerably reduced in comparison to his life  expectancy  in  the  UK
    where he could receive treatment. However,  the  Secretary  of  State's
    appeal was allowed because  the  evidence  did  not  reflect  the  near
    certainty expressed in the Adjudicator's decision  that  the  appellant
    would experience acute mental suffering to the point of taking his  own
    life. The Tribunal said that D v UK was  about  the  conditions  of  an
    imminent death, not about prolonging life.

24. In RG (Sri Lanka) [2005] UKIAT  00072  the  Tribunal  echoed  the  view
    expressed in MK and said that, in the light of N there was no  arguable
    basis for confining the principles in that case to its specific  facts.
    The Tribunal said that the judgement of the House of Lords in N made it
    clear that in order to succeed on an Article 3 claim the case  must  be
    "exceptional and extreme." The Tribunal noted that in Article 2 claims,
    a "near certainty of death" was required to  reach  the  threshold  and
    considered that a similar rigorous approach  was  required  to  suicide
    cases.  The Tribunal indicated that  evidence  of  past  harm  and  the
    seriousness of such attempts  was  highly  relevant,  albeit  that  the
    assessment depended upon evidence that was to some extent speculative.

25. Notwithstanding the debate in the submissions before me as  to  whether
    the judge was in error in various minor aspects of  the  assessment  of
    the evidence, in the light of the case law cited above, including  that
    relied on by Ms Watterson, and applied to the evidence and the facts of
    the present case, I find it is far from established,  even  taking  the
    evidence at its highest, that the risk of suicide in this  case,  meets
    the  very  high,  exceptional  and  extreme  threshold   necessary   to
    demonstrate a breach of articles 3 or 8 on removal. I am satisfied  the
    judge made a careful assessment of the evidence as a whole and  in  the
    round, reaching  a  conclusion  that  the  very  high  and  exceptional
    threshold was not met, either in relation to article 3  or  article  8.
    That conclusion was cogently reasoned and  is,  in  my  view,  entirely
    consistent with the case law and evidence. Even if one were to  exclude
    entirely the matters complained of in the grounds,  it  still  has  not
    been demonstrated that this appellant presents  such  risk  of  serious
    harm as to render his removal a breach of articles 3, or indeed 8 ECHR.
    In my view, it is inevitable on the available evidence that the outcome
    of the appeal would have been the same, and thus there is  no  material
    error of law in the making of the decision.

Conclusions:

26. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

                    I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed on all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal made an order. Given the circumstances, I continue  that  anonymity
order.


Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable in this case and thus there can be no fee award.
