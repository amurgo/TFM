Representation:

For the Appellants:    Ms A Vatish of Counsel instructed by Lawrence &
                    Associates Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr T Wilding, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants in this appeal are citizens of Cameroon.  The appellants
    appealed the decision of the respondent dated 29 March  2014  to  issue
    the appellants with residence cards as extended family members (mother-
    in-law and brothers-in-law) of an EEA national.  Judge  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Sullivan in  a  decision  promulgated  on  13  July  2016
    dismissed the appellants' appeal against the refusal of the  respondent
    to issue EEA residence cards.  In the decision promulgated on  13  July
    2016 Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Sullivan allowed the appeal of Mr
    Lionel Kum Foy, the spouse  of  the  EEA  sponsor,  but  dismissed  the
    appeals of the second, third, fourth and fifth  appellants  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal (the appellants before the Upper Tribunal)  on  the
    basis of a lack of adequate evidence that  they  were  extended  family
    members.

 2. The appellants appealed to the Upper Tribunal on the basis that it  was
    argued the judge erred in law in considering the issue  of  dependency.
    Upper Tribunal Judge Smith granted permission to appeal  on  17  August
    2017 but only on the ground that there were  no  valid  appeals  before
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal R Sullivan following the  decision  in
    Sala (EFMs: Right of  Appeal)  [2016]  UKUT  00411  (IAC).   The  Upper
    Tribunal decided that there is no right of appeal for  extended  family
    members in such cases.

 3. Although Ms Vatish's arguments before me were essentially that Sala was
    promulgated after the decision of First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Sullivan,
    which was promulgated on 13 July 2016 whereas Sala was reported  on  19
    September 2016, that does not assist the appellants as  Sala  sets  out
    what the law is  in  relation  to  extended  family  members.   In  her
    decision of 17 August 2017 Upper Tribunal Judge Smith  made  directions
    that unless she received objections in  writing  within  fourteen  days
    from 17 August 2017 she proposed  to  find  an  error  of  law  in  the
    decision insofar as it related to the  four  appellants  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal on the basis that the judge lacked jurisdiction in the appeals
    and proposed to set aside paragraphs [40] to [67] and paragraph [70] of
    the decision and re-make the decision dismissing  the  appeals  of  the
    four appellants.  There were no such objections  made  and  as  already
    noted Ms Vatish's point does not assist the appellants.  As I indicated
    to her, even if it did there was no merit  in  her  argument  that  the
    decision should be set aside and remitted as there was no other  ground
    of appeal before me apart from the Sala point.

Conclusion

The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  contained  an  error  of  law  in
relation to the four appellants in this appeal and  must  be  set  aside  at
paragraphs [40] to [67] and [70] of the decision.  I  re-make  the  decision
dismissing those appeals for want of jurisdiction.

No anonymity direction was sought or is made.
