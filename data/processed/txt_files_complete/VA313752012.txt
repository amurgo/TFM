Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Joseph Mulindwa (Sponsor)
For the Respondent:    Miss H Horsley, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a citizen of Uganda born on 29  July  1985.   She  has
    been granted permission  to  appeal  the  determination  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Abebrese dismissing her appeal against the  decision  of
    the respondent made on 20 July 2012 to refuse her application for entry
    clearance to the UK as a visitor.

2.   The appellant has a daughter with the sponsor.  The daughter is  called
    Joannah Zinunula Mulindwa Nalweyiso.  She was  born  in  Uganda  on  18
    April 2011.  As the sponsor, her father, is  a  British  national,  the
    child was issued with a British passport on 4 April 2013 to expire on 4
    April 2018.

3.   The appellant's appeal is in respect of the visit application she  made
    on 20 July 2012 which was  refused  on  8  August  2012  by  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer.  The decision was reviewed by  the  Entry  Clearance
    Manager on 9 January 2013.

4.   The Entry Clearance Officer's  reasons  for  refusing  the  appellant's
    application are:

         "(1) I am satisfied that the Uganda  entry  passport  stamps  dated
             12/3/2010 and the Uganda exit stamp dated 13/7/2010  (page  5)
             and the Uganda entry stamp dated 30/11/2010  and  Uganda  exit
             stamp dated 3/4/2011 (page 12) are not genuine  or  have  been
             fraudulently obtained, as they are not commensurate with  your
             travel history to the UK as claimed.  In your  passport  there
             are no corresponding arrival dates for either  of  the  Uganda
             departure stamps detailed.


         (2)  I am satisfied that the above-mentioned stamps are non-genuine
             and have been fraudulently obtained, as our records show  that
             you travelled from Brussels to the UK  on  the  26/2/2010  and
             then departed London Heathrow on the 2/8/2010, and then  again
             travelled to the  UK  from  Brussels  on  the  12/11/2010  and
             departed from London Heathrow on the 2/4/2011.


         (3)  Furthermore, you applied for entry  clearance  to  the  UK  on
             21/10/2010 to attend  a  CTA  Convention  and  were  issued  a
             business visit visa for the period  27/10/2010  to  27/4/2011.
             At  the  time  of  this  application  you  would   have   been
             approximately three months into your pregnancy, your  daughter
             having been born on 18/4/2011.  You stated at this application
             that you were married to Grace Ssinabulya who is  an  American
             citizen, and provided a marriage certificate dated  10/4/2010,
             as proof of your marriage and  claimed  family  circumstances.
             You made no mention of your current husband, Joseph  Mulindwa,
             on that application and stated that  you  had  no  friends  or
             family in the UK.  Our records show that you were in the UK at
             the time of your marriage to Grace Ssinabulya  and  could  not
             therefore been in Uganda at that time.  I note that  you  have
             now,  in  your  current  application,  provided  your  divorce
             certificate  dated  3/11/2011,  for  your  marriage  to  Grace
             Ssinabulya.  At a telephone interview, Joseph Mulindwa  stated
             that  you  were  married  on  the   22/4/2012.    Given   this
             information  I  am  satisfied  that  you   also   made   false
             representations with regard to knowing your current husband in
             the UK at the time of your earlier application."


5.   The appellant's application was refused under paragraph 320(7A) of  the
    Immigration Rules because false representation  in  the  form  of  non-
    genuine  passports,  entry/exit  stamps  was  produced  in   her   visa
    application.

6.   The appellant's application was also refused under paragraph 41(i)  and
    (ii) on the basis that she had stated in her Visa Application Form that
    it was her intention to apply for settlement in the UK with her husband
    at a later date, but at present the  UK  sponsor  could  not  meet  the
    requirements for  settlement  as  his  income  was  below  the  minimum
    threshold.  Given  the  documentation  provided,  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer was not satisfied that the appellant has strong family,  social
    or economic ties to Uganda.  Given her stated dependence on funds  sent
    from the UK sponsor, and her intention to apply for settlement  in  the
    UK, the Entry Clearance Officer considered that  there  was  little  to
    encourage the appellant to leave the UK at the end of her visit.

7.   The Entry Clearance Manager reviewed the decision and was satisfied  in
    the light of the evidence that false representations were made  by  the
    appellant on her previous application and that the current  application
    fell to be refused under paragraph 320(7B).

8.   The First-tier Tribunal Judge found as follows:-

         "8.  The appellant is sponsored  in  this  appeal  by  her  claimed
             husband Joseph Mulindwa and he  provided  documents  regarding
             his employment and bank details in support of the appeal.   He
             and the appellant maintain that the application is genuine and
             that they are indeed married to each other.   They  have  also
             produced the documents to show that  they  did  enter  into  a
             marriage and also that Joseph Mulindwa was free to enter  into
             the  marriage.   They  have  however  not  raised   sufficient
             evidence to challenge the use of the false documents  and  the
             facts relied upon by the respondent in this  appeal  that  the
             appellant seek to rely on the documents in order to gain entry
             into this country.  I do find on balance that  the  facts  and
             evidence relied on by the respondents has been proven and  the
             appellant has not discharged the  burden  of  proof  which  is
             imposed on them in law to required standard.   The  appeal  of
             the appellant is therefore dismissed."-

9.   The grant of permission by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Cruthers  said
    that contrary to the grounds on which the appellant seeks permission to
    appeal, in his operative paragraph (paragraph 8) the judge did refer to
    the respondent having proved his/her case.  Relying on paragraph 9 of R
    (Iran) [2005] EWCA Civ 982, 27 July 2005, he said it is  arguable  that
    the judge did not give adequate reasons for that conclusion.  The  FtTJ
    also said it is arguable that the judge should have considered  whether
    or not the  respondent's  decision  of  8  August  2012  represented  a
    disproportionate interference with the family life of  those  concerned
    as the appellant's original Notice of Appeal made reference to the best
    interests of certain children and being deprived of family life by  the
    decision under appeal.  He warned the appellant however that she should
    not take the grant of permission as any indication that her appeal will
    ultimately be successful.  She may struggle to  persuade  the  Tribunal
    that she met the requirements of  paragraph  41  at  the  date  of  the
    respondent's decision given amongst other things the matters set out in
    the  respondent's  decision  and  the  matters  referred  to   in   the
    appellant's own original notice of appeal.

10.  FtTJ Abebrese decided the appeal on the papers at the  request  of  the
    appellant.

11.  The sponsor gave me a  short  background  history  of  the  appellant's
    marriage to Grace Ssinabulya and of her visits to the UK.  He said they
    met when the appellant visited the UK for the CTA Convention  in  2010.
    She returned to Uganda and discovered she was  three  months  pregnant.
    They had intended to make a settlement application but she had  not  at
    the time taken the English language test.  He also  did  not  have  the
    required amount of funds to satisfy the maintenance requirement.   They
    want to get  the  visit  appeal  out  of  the  way  and  then  make  an
    application for settlement.  I asked him why he did not come  to  court
    to explain all this to the judge and he said he was studying and taking
    exams at the time.

12.  I find that this background information was not before  the  First-tier
    Judge and cannot be considered by me in deciding  whether  or  not  the
    judge made an error of law in his decision.  I shall therefore limit my
    consideration to the evidence that was before the FtTJ Abrebese.

13.  I find that the judge he did not make an error of law on  the  evidence
    that was before him.   Firstly,  the  appellant  has  not  refuted  the
    allegation that the Uganda exit and entry stamps were not  commensurate
    with her travel history to the UK as claimed.  She has also not refuted
    the records produced by the Entry Clearance Officer as to  her  travels
    from Brussels to the UK.

14.  The appellant has not also refuted the allegation that  when  she  made
    the application for entry clearance on 21 October 2010 she  provided  a
    marriage certificate dated 10 April 2010, as proof of her marriage  and
    claimed family circumstances.  She has also not refuted the  allegation
    that she made no mention of her current husband on that application and
    had stated that she had no friends or family in the UK.   I  have  seen
    the application which she made on 1 October 2010 and  she  does  indeed
    refer to being married to Grace  Ssinabulya.   If  there  was  pressure
    applied by her family to marry this  man  she  has  not  said  as  much
    herself.  Indeed the appellant has not written a letter to try and  set
    the record straight.  Rather what she has been saying in her grounds is
    that the judge failed to take account of the fact that  the  burden  of
    proof lay  on  the  respondent  with  regard  to  the  authenticity  or
    otherwise of the entry stamps.  I accept Miss Horsely's submission that
    the judge did in fact make the  finding  that  the  appellant  had  not
    raised sufficient evidence to challenge the use of the false  documents
    and the facts relied upon by the respondent.  Consequently, his finding
    that the facts and evidence relied upon the respondent had been  proven
    was open to him.

15.  The appellant went on to say in her grounds that the  judge  failed  to
    take account of the fact that her daughter is  a  British  citizen  and
    that effectively the refusal to permit the appellant entry clearance to
    travel to the UK prevents the British child from travelling to  the  UK
    and frustrates the child's Article 8 entitlement.

16.  In this regard I accept the submission made  by  Ms  Horsley.   At  the
    date of the Entry Clearance Officer's decision, that is August 2012, it
    had not been accepted by the FCO that the child  was  British.   Indeed
    the letter from the FCO dated 28 November  2012  said  that  they  were
    unable to confirm the child's identity on the basis  of  the  documents
    submitted.  They offered the sponsor the  option  of  establishing  his
    relationship to the applicant/daughter by means of  DNA  testing.   The
    results of the DNA test were revealed  on  30  January  2013.   In  any
    event, the child being British and having a  British  passport  is  not
    prevented from travelling to the UK. She is entitled to enter the UK at
    any time.  The decision of the Entry Clearance Officer does not prevent
    the child from enjoying her right as a British national in the UK.

17.  As to the appellant's appeal under  paragraph  41  I  accept  that  the
    judge was very brief in his finding that she  had  not  discharged  the
    burden of proof imposed on her to the required standard.  I formed  the
    view that the judge relied on the false  documents  and  the  facts  as
    presented by the Entry Clearance Officer to  make  that  finding.   The
    facts relied on by the Entry Clearance Officer included the appellant's
    own evidence  at  the  interview  that  her  husband/sponsor  has  just
    finished his studies and has not yet got a job that meets  the  �18,600
    minimum threshold as required by the new Rules.  They intended to apply
    for a settlement visa once he had attained that requirement.   She  and
    her husband have discussed the cheapest and most convenient  ways  they
    can keep their family union and have chosen the option of the appellant
    and their daughter visiting him in the UK.  On this evidence the  Entry
    Clearance Officer was entitled to doubt that the appellant would return
    to Uganda at the end of her stated visit.

18.  I find that the judge's decision does not disclose  an  error  of  law.
    The judge's decision dismissing the appellant's appeal shall stand.
