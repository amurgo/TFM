Representation:

For the Appellant: Ms Patel of Lei Dat Baig Solicitors
For the Respondent: Mr A Mc Vitie Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction
1. I have considered whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  an
   anonymity direction.  No  anonymity  direction  was  made  previously  in
   respect of this Appellant. Having considered all  the  circumstances  and
   evidence I do not deem it necessary to make an anonymity direction.
2. The Secretary of State for the Home Department brings this appeal but  in
   order to avoid confusion the parties are referred to as they were in  the
   First-tier Tribunal. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  against
   a decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Tiffen, promulgated on 1 May 2014
   which allowed the Appellant's appeal against a refusal of entry clearance
   as a spouse under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.

Background


3. The Appellant was born on 5 February 1987 and is a citizen of  China  and
   is the wife of Zhao Haiyang who is a British citizen.
4. The Appellant applied for entry clearance as a spouse of Mr Haiyang.
5.  On  1  July  2013  the  Secretary  of  State  refused  the   Appellant's
   application under Appendix FM of the Rules. The refusal was on the  basis
   that there was a discrepancy between  the  payslips  in  respect  of  his
   employment and the deposits into  the  sponsors  bank  account  from  his
   employment and there was not explanation for  the  difference.  Therefore
   the Respondent concluded that he could not be satisfied that the  sponsor
   provided the specified documents or that he earned the money claimed.


The Judge's Decision


6.  The  Appellant  appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  First-tier
   Tribunal Judge Tiffen (hereinafter called "the  Judge")  dealt  with  the
   application on the papers. The Judge found that there  were  five  months
   where the payslips and the sum paid into the sponsors  account  from  his
   employment did not match. The sponsor had provided a letter dated 20 July
   2013 which the judge recognised post dated the date of decision but found
   he was entitled to  consider  its  contents  as  it  appertained  to  pre
   decision documentation. Having considered the contents of that letter  he
   found that the reason for the difference in the figures was credible  and
   therefore accepted that the Appellant had met the financial  requirements
   of the Rules.
7. Grounds of appeal were lodged and on 13  June  2014  First-tier  Tribunal
   Judge Holmes gave permission to appeal.

8. At the hearing I heard submissions from Mr Mc  Vitie  on  behalf  of  the
   Respondent that :

   a) There was a discrepancy between the figure  stated  in  the  sponsor's
      payslip and the sums deposited into his bank account.

   b)  Whichever  figure  was  accepted  the  sponsor  met   the   financial
      requirements of the Rules.

   c) The issue was  whether  it  was  open  to  the  Judge  to  accept  the
      explanation given by the sponsor's employer for the discrepancy.

9. On behalf of the Appellant Ms Patel relied on her skeleton argument.
Finding on Material Error

10. Having heard those submissions and considered the evidence before  me  I
   reached the conclusion that the Tribunal made no material errors of law.

11. The Appellant applied on 28 May 2013 for entry clearance as  the  spouse
   of Mr Haiyang the sponsor. The only issue in the  case  was  whether  the
   Appellant met the financial requirements of the  Rules  by  reference  to
   specified evidence set out in Appendix FM-SE paragraph 2:

   "(c) Personal bank statements corresponding to the same period(s) as  the
   wage slips at paragraph 2(a), showing that the salary has been paid  into
   an account in the name of the person or in the name  of  the  person  and
   their partner jointly."

12.   In the visa  application  the  Appellant  asserted  that  the  sponsor
   earned  �18999.96  in  his  employment  with  the  Golden  Park   Chinese
   restaurant where he had worked as the General  Manager  since  1  October
   2012. In support of the  application  the  Appellant  provided  6  months
   payslips, an  employer's  letter  and  bank  statements  for  the  period
   December 2012 to May 2013. There was  also  a  P60  from  HMRC  providing
   independent documentary corroboration of the salary claimed.

13. The Appellant was, until April 2013, paid by cheque and  thereafter  the
   deposits into his account were by way of a direct transfer. It was not in
   dispute that there was a difference between  the  figures  given  in  the
   Appellant's salary slips and the sums deposited in his  account  when  he
   was paid by cheque as they were, in all cases,  higher  than  the  figure
   given in the  payslip.  The  Judge  had  before  him  and  made  specific
   reference to a letter dated 20 July 2014 from  Alice  Huang  the  Company
   Manager of the Golden Park Chinese Restaurant. That  letters  provides  a
   detailed explanation as to a mistake he made in typing that  his  monthly
   salary was �1588.33 when it  was  �1583.33  and  that  the  cheques  also
   included adjustments for an advance and reimbursement of a wine  bill  he
   had paid on behalf of the restaurant.

14. The letter is a matter of record and the Judge is  not  obliged  to  set
   out every aspect of the explanation given but I am satisfied that it  was
   open to him to accept that explanation. I am satisfied that it  was  open
   to the Judge to find the explanation credible  given  that  there  is  no
   requirement for the deposit to exactly match the  payslip  and  that  the
   Judge made clear he was taking into account all of the evidence and  that
   included a P60.

15. I am therefore satisfied that the Judge's determination when read  as  a
   whole set out findings that were sustainable  and  sufficiently  detailed
   and based on cogent reasoning.

CONCLUSION

16. I therefore found that no errors of law have been established  and  that
   the Judge's determination should stand.

DECISION

17. The appeal is dismissed.
