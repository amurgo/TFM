                                  Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal made an order  pursuant  to  rule  45(4)(i)  of  the
Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.

I continue that order (pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008) and consequently, this  determination  identifies  the
appellant by initials only.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   This is the appeal of Mr AA, a national of Iran born on 27th  December,
    1993.  He entered the United Kingdom, travelling in a  lorry,  on  30th
    November, 2010, when he was 16 years of  age.   He  made  a  claim  for
    asylum based on his imputed political  opinion  and  Kurdish  ethnicity
    which the Secretary of State refused.  The reasons for the Secretary of
    State's refusal were set out in a letter  addressed  to  the  appellant
    dated 12th February 2011.  The appellant was given discretionary  leave
    until he reached the age of 17ï¿½ on 27th  June,  2011.   That  grant  of
    leave was for less than six months and so refusal  of  the  appellant's
    asylum claim attracted no right of appeal.   Further  applications  for
    leave to remain were made and in the light of these further submissions
    there was a further refusal on 21st October, 2014.

2.   As a result of the refusal letter on 21st October, 2014, the  appellant
    appealed to the First-tier Tribunal and his appeal came  before  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Plumptre at Hatton Cross  on  28th  January,  2015.
    Those representing the appellant sought and were granted permission  to
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal from the First-tier Tribunal in respect of
    six of their seven challenges  to  the  judge's  determination  and  on
    application  to  the  Upper  Tribunal,  were  successful  in  obtaining
    permission to challenge the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge's  decision  in
    respect of the seventh ground set out in the grounds of appeal.

3.   At the hearing before me today Mr  Hoshi  appeared  on  behalf  of  the
    appellant instructed by Brighton Housing Trust and Ms Fijiwala, a  Home
    Office Presenting Officer, appeared on behalf of the respondent.

4.   Since there appeared to be no Rule 24 response from the Home  Office  I
    asked Ms Fijiwala to indicate the respondent's views in respect of each
    of the seven challenges.  She did so briefly and then I invited Counsel
    to address me in opening and during the course  of  his  submission  in
    respect of the first challenge it  became  clear  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge was concerned about the expertise of the expert who  had
    provided a report in respect of the appellant's claim.   Such  was  the
    degree of concern she expressed about the expert's expertise  that  she
    asked the appellant's representatives  to  obtain  and  submit  to  her
    within fourteen days a letter answering several of her concerns.

5.   A letter was subsequently written and that appears at pages  57  to  60
    in the appellant's bundle before me.  It sets out  the  three  specific
    questions the judge felt she needed the expert to  answer.   The  first
    question asks her to confirm that she is an Iranian citizen, the second
    to give details of whether or not she had ever been to Iran and  if  so
    when she went there and the  date  of  her  last  trip,  and  the  last
    question asks her to confirm whether she had  prepared  expert  reports
    for other asylum cases, whether any of them are reported decisions  and
    whether she had appeared to give evidence as an expert witness  at  any
    asylum appeals.

6.   It was clear  to  me  that  the  nature  of  the  enquiries  which  the
    Immigration Judge caused to be made, demonstrated that the  First  Tier
    Tribunal Judge  must  have  had  considerable  reservations  about  the
    expertise of the witness.  Unfortunately  the  reply  from  the  expert
    dated 3rd February, 2015, which was sent  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    before the judge's determination was promulgated,  did  not  reach  the
    First-tier  Tribunal  Judge   until   after   her   determination   was
    promulgated, if at all.  As a result her determination was  promulgated
    at a time when she clearly harboured grave concerns about the expertise
    of the author of the expert report.

7.   Ms Fijiwala suggested initially that any  error  on  the  part  of  the
    First Tier Tribunal Judge was not  material,  but  subsequently,  quite
    properly in my view, accepted that this must amount to a material error
    of law because the judge's determination was promulgated at a time when
    she clearly harboured grave concerns about the expertise of the  author
    of the expert report, sufficient to cause her to insist that the expert
    answer three  specific  questions  designed  to  assess  the  witnesses
    expertise.   The  Home  Office  Presenting  Officer  accepted  that  is
    impossible to know to what extent the Immigration Judge was concerned.

8.   I am satisfied that the nature of the enquiries raised  by  First  Tier
    Tribunal Judge Plumptre showed that she had grave  concerns  about  the
    expertise of the witness and did not, therefore accord the contents  of
    the report the weight which she otherwise would have accorded.   It  is
    impossible to know what affect this had on the outcome  of  the  appeal
    hearing.

9.   I set aside the determination of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Plumptre.
    Bearing in mind the Senior President's Practice  Direction,  I  believe
    that the appropriate course for me in the circumstances  is  to  direct
    that the appeal should be heard again de novo, by a  judge  other  than
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Plumptre at Hatton Cross.  The time  estimate
    is three hours.
