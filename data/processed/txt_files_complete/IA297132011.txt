For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, HOPO


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   This case has had a long history.  I shall refer  to  the  most  recent
    events as recorded by Upper Tribunal Judge Craig in  his  decision  and
    directions dated 3 July 2013.

2.   On 22 August 2011, the  appellant's  appeal  against  the  respondent's
    decision that Section 32(5) of the UK Borders Act 2007 applied  to  him
    was  dismissed  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   On  3  September  2011
    permission was refused by the Upper Tribunal.   The  appellant  renewed
    his application but it was further refused.  Then on 14  October  2011,
    the appellant's representatives  made  an  application  to  revoke  his
    deportation order, which application was refused by the  respondent  on
    17 October 2011.  On the  same  day,  that  is  17  October  2011,  the
    appellant's application for judicial review in respect of the  decision
    of the Upper Tribunal to refuse permission to  appeal  was  refused  by
    Ousley J, who also ordered that the renewal of  his  application  would
    not be a bar to his removal.

3.   On the following day, 18 October 2011, the appellant lodged  an  appeal
    against the respondent's decision refusing to  revoke  the  deportation
    order.  The appellant was subsequently removed  to  Bangladesh  by  the
    respondent.

4.   Following a Case Management hearing  on  21  December  2011  at  Hatton
    Cross, First-tier Tribunal Judge Pullig, in a  Ruling  and  Directions,
    ruled  that  by  virtue  of  Section  92(4)(a)  of   the   Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, the appellant had an in-country  right
    of appeal, having previously made a human rights claim.  He  considered
    that the appellant had a right to appeal the  respondent's  refusal  to
    revoke that deportation order pursuant to Section 82(2)(k) of the  2002
    Act.

5.   Although noting that the respondent would be aware  that  the  Tribunal
    had no power to order the respondent to return  the  appellant,  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Pullig nonetheless directed  that  "the  respondent
    must notify the Tribunal in writing ... of the  steps  she  intends  to
    take to ensure the appellant's return to  this  country  and  when  she
    intends to do so".

6.   In response to the ruling, the respondent notified  the  Tribunal  that
    she intended to take no steps to ensure the appellant's return to  this
    country and that she never intended to do so.  Further,  she  purported
    to appeal this decision.

7.   Bypassing the  rest  of  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Craig's  decision  and
    directions, I  find  that  the  respondent's  decision  to  remove  the
    appellant was lawful.  I give my reasons below.

8.   I note from the respondent's decision letter of 17  October  2011  that
    the respondent signed the deportation order against the appellant on 24
    May 2011.  On 14 October 2011 the appellant's representatives requested
    that the deportation order be revoked on the basis that the appellant's
    risk of re-offending has not been properly considered and advised  that
    they  had  instructed  Dr  Raj  Persaud  to  conduct   an   independent
    assessment.

9.   On 17 October 2011 the respondent rejected the appellant's  submissions
    as they did not contain grounds raised under the European Convention on
    Human Rights or the Refugee Convention in line with  Section  92(4)  of
    the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.   The  appellant  was
    informed that he could not appeal the respondent's  decision  while  he
    was in the United Kingdom.  He was also informed  that  directions  had
    been given for his removal to Bangladesh.

10.  I find as a consequence that the Respondent made a lawful  decision  to
    remove the appellant to Bangladesh.

11.  I find that the appeal which the appellant lodged on  18  October  2011
    whilst he was in the United Kingdom, was invalid.

12.  I find that  I  have  no  jurisdiction  to  determine  the  appellant's
    appeal.

13.  No anonymity direction is made.
