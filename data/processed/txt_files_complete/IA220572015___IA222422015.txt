                                                                 Respondents


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr. P. Duffy, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Mr. M. Hasan, Counsel, instructed by Kalam
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  against  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Easterman, promulgated on  5  July  2017,  in
    which he allowed the appeals of Mr. Md. Choudhury and Mr. J.  Choudhury
    against the Secretary of State's decision to refuse leave to remain  in
    the United Kingdom as Tier 1 entrepreneurs.


 2. For the purposes of this decision I refer to Mr. Md. Choudhury and  Mr.
    J. Choudhury as the Appellants, and to the Secretary of  State  as  the
    Respondent, reflecting their positions as they were before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal.


 3. Permission to appeal was granted as follows:


         "In my assessment it is arguable, as per paragraphs 2 to 14 of  the
         grounds on which the respondent seeks permission  to  appeal,  that
         the judge may have adopted an  erroneous  approach  when  assessing
         whether or not the respondent had made out her allegation that  the
         appellant had obtained their TOEIC (English language)  certificates
         by dishonesty. [....]


         It may also be arguable,  as  per  paragraphs  15  and  16  of  the
         respondent's grounds, that the judge did not adequately assess  the
         financial aspects of  the  case,  or  sufficiently  factor  in  the
         evidence said to establish the  respondent's  case  in  respect  of
         crucial bank documentation."


 4. The Appellants attended the hearing.  I  heard  submissions  from  both
    representatives following which I reserved my decision.


Submissions


 5. At the outset of the hearing, I  referred  to  paragraph  [40]  of  the
    decision, which appeared to show  that  the  Judge  was  aware  of  the
    correct approach in ETS cases regarding the discharge of the burden  of
    proof by the Respondent, and the shift of the burden to the Appellants,
    the substance of Ground 1.  Mr. Duffy agreed and accepted that  it  was
    difficult for him to maintain the challenge to the decision set out  in
    Ground 1.  He also accepted that there was no merit in Ground  3  given
    that even if updated evidence had been provided,  it  would  have  been
    inadmissible under the evidential rules which  relate  to  points-based
    system appeals.


 6. He therefore relied only on Ground 2.  He submitted that there had been
    a failure of the Judge to give adequate reasons in [40].  The Judge had
    essentially said that he was aware of what the caselaw  said  regarding
    the burden of proof in ETS  cases,  and  on  balance  he  accepted  the
    Appellants' accounts.  This was insufficient reasoning  for  preferring
    the Appellants' accounts.


 7. In response Mr. Hasan submitted that the evidence had been set out from
    [14] to [18].  The judge had referred to the evidence  put  forward  by
    the Appellants both in their  witness  statements,  in  examination  in
    chief, and in cross-examination.  He had recorded the evidence at [18],
    and it was this evidence  which  had  persuaded  him  to  come  to  the
    conclusion at [40].   The  evidence  had  led  him  to  find  that  the
    Appellants' evidence crossed the threshold.


 8. I was referred to the Rule 24 response, where paragraph 57  of  SM  and
    Qadir (ETS - Evidence - Burden of Proof) [2016] UKUT 229 (IAC) was  set
    out.  The judge had the evidence before him to show that the burden  of
    proof had been discharged.  He had mentioned all material facts and had
    given reasons.  The same conclusion would have been reached even if the
    Judge had written more.


Error of law


 9. As stated above, no reliance was placed on Grounds 1 or 3 by Mr. Duffy.
     Ground 2 is the alleged  failure  of  the  Judge  to  give  sufficient
    reasons for his finding that the Appellants had discharged  the  burden
    of proof in relation to the ETS issue.


10. As set out above, I find that the judge correctly set out  the  law  in
    relation to the burden of proof in ETS cases  [40].   Having  set  this
    out, the Judge then gave his reasons for finding  that  the  Appellants
    had discharged the burden of proof.  He states as follows:


         "Both of these appellants have explained why they  chose  the  test
         centre they chose.  They have given answers largely in line,  given
         the length of time it is since  the  tests  were  taken,  with  the
         handbook   provided   by   the   respondent,   and   on    balance,
         notwithstanding the evidence of the respondent, I cannot say that I
         am satisfied that these tests were taken fraudulently.  I find that
         the appellants, with their apparent knowledge of what  went  on  in
         the tests, cross the threshold and make it  more  likely  than  not
         that they took the tests."


11. The judge set out the evidence at [14] to [18].  At  [16]  to  [19]  he
    recorded the oral evidence.  Paragraph [16] states:


         "In evidence the first appellant, having adopted his statement, was
         asked why he went to Elizabeth College and he said his nephew  (the
         second appellant) did  the  test  first  and  he  recommended  that
         centre.  He was asked what the procedure was and he said he went to
         the college, gave a photo identity, they gave him an exam date  and
         he paid his money for the fee.  He said it was quite far away  from
         his home, it was two or three trains, nearly  an  hour's  worth  of
         journey.  He lived in Tower Hamlets.  He could not recall the  area
         of the test centre but he recalled it was  in  Stewart  Road.   The
         second appellant told him how to get there.  He thought the fee was
         something of the order of ï¿½135."


12. Paragraph [18] states:


         "The appellant was asked questions about the testing and he said he
         had done the reading and listening and after a few days, perhaps  a
         couple of weeks, he had taken the speaking and  writing  test.   He
         was asked how many questions he was asked in the speaking test  and
         he said he thought ten or eleven.  He was asked  how  long  he  was
         given to complete the test and he said he could not recall  exactly
         but it was between 20 and 25 minutes.  He was asked more questions.
          He said that there were  about  fifteen  to  twenty  other  people
         taking  the  test.   He  said  there   were   explanations   and/or
         instructions, they were computer based.  There were instructions on
         how to use the computer and then the appellant said  in  answer  to
         me, by way of further clarification that someone had shown him to a
         seat, and given him a code to put into the computer, and  when  the
         exam started there were instructions coming from the computer."


13. At [37] the Judge states that he has given careful consideration to the
    documents and the oral evidence.  At [49] he states:


         "Thus on the totality of the evidence before me,  in  each  of  the
         appellant's cases I find in favour of the appellants  on  both  the
         E.T.S. issue and the false bank statement issues, meaning that  the
         respondent has not justified the refusal of these applications".


14. I find that it is clear from [37] and [49] that  the  Judge  has  taken
    into account all of the evidence before him, which  includes  that  set
    out at [14] to [18], when coming to his decision in relation to the ETS
    issue.


15. At [40] the judge gives reasons for finding that  the  Appellants  have
    answered the Respondent's case.  He finds that  they  have  both  given
    reasons for why they chose the test centre that they chose.   He  finds
    that the answers given by them were "largely in line" with the handbook
    provided by the Respondent.  He refers to the Appellants' knowledge  of
    what went on in the tests, as set out  in  the  evidence.   Finally  he
    finds that it is more likely than not that they took the tests.


16. Considering [14] to [18], together with [40] where the judge  sets  out
    his conclusions, I find that the Judge has given sufficient reasons for
    his finding that the Appellants have discharged the burden  upon  them.
    It is clear from [40] that he has accepted the  explanations  given  by
    the Appellants as set out in their witness statements, and in the  oral
    evidence, which he has set out in his decision.  It is  clear  that  he
    accepts that they have offered innocent explanations, and  he  has  set
    out those innocent explanations in the decision itself.


17. Taking the decision as a  whole,  I  find  that  the  judge  has  given
    sufficient reasons for finding  that  the  Appellants  met  the  burden
    placed upon them in relation to the ETS issue.  There is  no  error  of
    law.


Decision


 18. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not involve the making  of
     a material error of law.  I do not set the decision aside.


 19. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands.


 20. No anonymity direction is made.
