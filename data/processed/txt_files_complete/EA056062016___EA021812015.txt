For the Appellant:     Mr P Paraskos, Counsel instructed by Kamberley
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms Z Ahmed, Specialist Appeals Team


                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Algeria born on 11 May 1987.  On  1  July
    2011 he married Palmira Euritse Coque, a Portuguese national born on 12
    February 1986 said then to be exercising Treaty Rights  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  In September 2011 the Respondent issued a Residence  Card  to
    the Appellant valid for five years.

 2. On 10 April 2015 the decree absolute of the marriage of  the  Appellant
    and Ms Coque was pronounced.

 3. On 5 May 2015 the Appellant through solicitors not involved  in  either
    of these two appeals  made  an  application  for  confirmation  of  the
    Appellant's retained right of residence following his divorce.   On  19
    October 2015 the Respondent refused the  application  in  part  on  the
    basis the Appellant had not produced evidence to show his  ex-wife  was
    exercising Treaty Rights at the date of the decree absolute.   I  shall
    refer to this decision of the Respondent as the 2015 decision.

 4. On 20 November 2015 by a different firm  of  solicitors  the  Appellant
    applied to the Respondent for a Permanent Residence Card  which  on  26
    April 2016 the Respondent refused on the sole basis that the  Appellant
    had failed to  produce  satisfactory  evidence  that  his  ex-wife  was
    exercising Treaty Rights at the date of the decree absolute.   I  shall
    refer to this decision of the Respondent as  the  2016  decision.   The
    2015 decision related to a retained right of Residence Card application
    and  the  2016  decision  related  to  a   Permanent   Residence   Card
    application.

 5. The Appellant through the same solicitors lodged notices of appeal on 3
    November 2015 and 11 May 2016.

 6. In August 2016 the Appellant instructed his present solicitors.

 7. The First-tier Tribunal linked the appeals but for  reasons  which  are
    not clear from the file a notice of hearing was issued  in  respect  of
    only the appeal against the 2015 decision.

 8. The matter came before Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Paul  on  2
    December 2016.  Mr Paraskos was not instructed on  that  occasion.   Ms
    Ahmad informed the Tribunal that  the  Respondent  was  represented  by
    Counsel and that Counsel's minutes  showed  there  was  some  confusion
    about which appeal was before Judge Paul.

 9. By a decision promulgated on 13 December 2016 Judge Paul dismissed both
    appeals for the primary reason that he was not satisfied the  Appellant
    had shown his ex-wife was exercising Treaty Rights at the date  of  the
    decree absolute.

10. On 26 June 2017 Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Robertson granted  the
    Appellant permission to appeal on the ground that it was  arguable  the
    Judge had erred in failing to give adequate reasons for  rejecting  the
    Appellant's evidence why his ex-wife was not at court and the  evidence
    provided by the Appellant from HM Revenue & Customs to  show  his  wife
    had been in employment.

11. At the Upper Tribunal hearing both parties accepted they would make  no
    issue about the procedural irregularities in the First-tier Tribunal in
    relation to the lack of notice of the hearing of the appeal against the
    2016 decision.  The parties agreed that in the light of what  was  said
    in the 2016 decision, it was clear the Respondent no longer  challenged
    the length of subsistence of the Appellant's marriage.  The sole  issue
    was whether the Appellant's ex-wife had been exercising  Treaty  Rights
    at the date of the decree absolute.  I referred the parties to pages  6
    and 7 of the Appellant's bundle filed in the First-tier Tribunal on  25
    November 2016.  These clearly showed the Appellant's ex-wife  had  been
    in employment for the tax years ending 5 April 2013, 2015 and 2016.

12. The Judge had made no reference to this in his decision.   I  indicated
    that I saw no reason not to find in relation to the 2015 decision  that
    the Judge had erred in law and that the appeal should be  substantively
    allowed because there was evidence from HM Revenue &  Customs  to  show
    that the Appellant's ex-wife was exercising Treaty Rights at  the  date
    of decree absolute.

13. There followed discussion about what to do with the appeal against  the
    2016 decision which had refused the  Appellant  a  Permanent  Residence
    Card.

14. It became evident the Appellant had not filed  sufficient  evidence  to
    show he had been in employment for  five  years.   I  suggested  to  Mr
    Paraskos that he may wish to take instructions  although  he  had  said
    that he had been instructed only in respect of the  2015  decision.  He
    did so.

15. When the hearing resumed Mr Paraskos confirmed the Appellant wished  to
    withdraw his appeal against the 2016 decision.  I was satisfied that in
    the light of the discussions which had  taken  place  there  were  good
    reasons for the Appellant to withdraw his appeal.

Anonymity

There was no request for an anonymity direction and having heard the  appeal
I consider none is required.

NOTICE OF DECISION

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal in relation to  both  the  2015
    and the 2016 decisions contained a material error of  law  and  is  set
    aside.  The appeal against the 2015 decision under  Tribunal  reference
    EA/02181/2015 is allowed under the Immigration (EEA) Regulations  2006.




    The  appeal  against  the  2016  decision  under   Tribunal   reference
    EA/05606/2016 is withdrawn.

Signed/Official  Crest                                            Date   10.

TO THE RESPONDENT: FEE AWARD

I have allowed the appeal against the 2016 decision and so  have  considered
whether to make a fee award.  In all the circumstances, I  do  not  consider
it appropriate to make a fee award since the relevant evidence on which  the
appeal has been decided was not produced until 25 November 2016.

Signed/Official  Crest                                            Date   10.
