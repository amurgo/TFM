Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr A Alam of Lawgate solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms Kiss, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. I have considered whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  an
anonymity direction. No anonymity direction was made previously  in  respect
of this Appellant. Having considered all the circumstances  and  evidence  I
do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.


2. This is an appeal by the Appellant against  the  decision  of  First-tier
Tribunal Judge Richards-Clarke promulgated on 16 May 2017,  which  dismissed
the Appellant's appeal on all grounds.

Background


3. The Appellant was born on 1 December 1984 and is a national of  Pakistan.
On 11 August 2016 the Appellant applied for entry  clearance  as  a  partner
under appendix FM of the Immigration  Rules.  The  respondent  refused  that
application on 2 November 2016.

The Judge's Decision

4. The Appellant appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal.  First-tier  Tribunal
Judge  Richards-Clarke  ("the  Judge")  dismissed  the  appeal  against  the
Respondent's decision.

5. Grounds of appeal were lodged and  on  9  February  2018  Upper  Tribunal
Judge Pitt gave permission to appeal stating

      1. The appellant is a national of Pakistan whose  appeal  against  the
      refusal of her fianc�e and human rights  entry  clearance  application
      was dismissed by the First-tier Tribunal Judge (FTTJ) Richards-Clarke.


      2. The grounds are not of the clearest and I do not want to  give  the
      appellant false hope but it is, just, arguable that the FTTJ  did  not
      assess the financial evidence correctly and that this had  a  material
      impact on the human rights assessment.


      3. All grounds are arguable.

The Hearing

6. (a) Mr Alam moved the grounds of appeal for the  appellant.  He  told  me
that the appellant challenges  the  Judge's  findings  in  relation  to  the
financial requirements of appendix FM to the immigration rules. He  told  me
that, despite the fact the decision notice appealed against  says  that  the
entry clearance officer did not have original bank statements, and,  despite
the Judge's finding that the sponsor's original  bank  statements  were  not
before the entry clearance officer, the appellant insists that she  produced
all of the documents required by appendix  FM-SC,  including  original  bank
statements for the period from April 2015 to April 2016. He told me that  he
had those bank statements and tendered them at the bar of the court.

(b) Mr Alam told me that the Judge does not adequately explain why  she  did
not give weight to the financial documents  produced  by  the  sponsor,  and
told me that there was adequate evidence of  the  sponsor's  self-employment
and the level of his income. He told me that the  Judge  should  have  found
that the requirements of the immigration rules are met. He  reminded  me  of
rule 15(2A) of the procedure rules, and asked me to consider a  sequence  of
bank statements tendered at the bar.

(c) Mr Alam urged me to  set  the  decision  aside  and  substitute  my  own
decision allowing the appellant's appeal.

7. For the respondent, Ms Kiss told me that the decision  does  not  contain
errors of law, material or otherwise.  She  reminded  me  that  this  appeal
called before the First-tier  as  a  paper  hearing.  She  referred  to  the
Judge's findings at [14] of  the  decision,  and  reminded  me  of  relevant
immigration rules quoted by the Judge at [9] of the decision.  She  told  me
that the Judge found that the relationship requirements of  the  rules  were
met (between [10] and [12] of the decision),  but  that  the  appellant  had
failed  to  demonstrate  that  she  and  the  sponsor  meet  the   financial
requirements. She told me that the question of what  documents  were  before
the entry clearance officer remains a matter of  dispute,  but  the  Judge's
finding that the documents were not before the entry clearance officer is  a
finding well within the range of reasonable findings available to the  Judge
on the evidence before her. She urged me to dismiss  the  appeal  and  allow
the decision to stand.

Analysis

8. The  respondent's  decision  notice  and  explanatory  statement  clearly
states that the entry clearance  officer  rejected  the  sponsor's  Barclays
bank statements from April 2015 to July 2016 because they  were  neither  on
official bank stationary nor were they accompanied  by  a  letter  from  the
bank  confirming  their  authenticity.  The  decision  also  says  that  the
application was not supported by the sponsor's annual audited  accounts  for
his self-employment with the name of the accountant clearly shown.

9. In the grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal the sponsor  declares
that the entry clearance officer was provided with,  amongst  other  things,
an accountant's letter and unaudited accounts. The  unaudited  accounts  are
for the year ending 31/03/2016.  The  bank  statements  in  the  appellant's
bundle run from 27 February 2015 to 27 July 2016. Although  the  Judge  says
that the bank statements are not on official bank stationary,  they  are.  I
am aware that I may have  caused  confusion  by  accepting  bank  statements
tendered at the bar, but it is the  bank  statements  contained  within  the
bundle which was before the First-tier tribunal that I have  considered  and
I can see that those bank statements are on  official  bank  stationary  and
cover the tax year to 6 April 2016.

10. I look at the bundle which was before the First-tier & I  can  see  that
is not surprising that the sponsor expresses his astonishment at page 12  of
the grounds of appeal to the First-tier. The  documentary  evidence  that  I
can  see,  which  was  before  the  First-tier,  indicates  that  the  entry
clearance officer was provided with the sponsor's annual unaudited  accounts
with a  covering  letter  from  the  sponsor's  accountant  (confirming  his
membership of an accredited accounting  organisation)  and  that  the  entry
clearance  officer  was  provided  with  monthly  bank  statements  for  the
sponsors current-account which covered the  relevant  12  month  tax  return
period.

11. Having trawled through the documents which were before the First-tier  I
can only come to the conclusion that the Judge's findings at  [14]  of  [15]
proceed on an error of fact. The second sentence of [14] is incorrect.  That
error of fact amounts to a material  error  of  law.  I  therefore  set  the
decision aside.

12. There is sufficient material before  me  to  enable  me  to  remake  the
decision. I set the decision aside because of the errors of  fact  contained
at [14] and [15] of the decision. No  challenge  is  taken  to  the  Judge's
findings at [10] to [12] of the decision.  Those  are  sustainable  findings
that the appellant meets the relationship requirements  of  appendix  FM  to
the immigration rules

13. Mindful of the standard of proof and  taking  account  of  the  covering
letter which lists the documents sent to  the  entry  clearance  officer,  I
accept the sponsor's evidence that  the  documents  which  were  before  the
First-tier Tribunal are the documents which were before the entry  clearance
officer. Those documents include the sponsor's tax  returns,  the  sponsor's
monthly bank  statements  for  the  same  period  as  the  tax  return;  the
sponsor's annual  unaudited  accounts,  together  with  a  letter  from  his
accountant  confirming  his  membership  of  the  Institute   of   Chartered
Management Accountants. Those documents confirm that the sponsors income  in
the tax year to 2016 was �19,792.

14. That is sufficient evidence to show the appellant  meets  the  financial
requirements of appendix FM.

15. The only competent ground of  appeal  is  on  article  8  ECHR  grounds.
Appendix FM states at paragraph GEN 1.1 that  the  appendix  "reflects  how,
under article 8 of the human rights convention, the balance will  be  struck
between the right to respect for private and family life and the  legitimate
aims of protecting national security, public safety and the  economic  well-
being of the UK". It  follows  that  an  appellant,  who  makes  a  specific
application under appendix FM, is implicitly making a claim that he  or  she
is entitled to entry/leave to remain on the basis  of  that  provision  that
seeks  to  incorporate  his  human  rights.  The   Immigration   Directorate
Instructions define a human rights claim as including an  application  under
appendix FM.

 Article 8 ECHR.

16. In Hesham Ali (Iraq) v SSHD   [2016] UKSC 60  it  was  made  clear  that
(even in a deport case) the Rules are not a  complete  code.  Lord  Reed  at
paragraphs 47 to 50 endorsed the structured approach to proportionality  (to
be found in Razgar) and said "what has now become the established method  of
analysis can therefore continue to be followed..." In  Agyarko  [2017]  UKSC
11, Lord Reed (when explaining how  a  court  or  tribunal  should  consider
whether a refusal of leave to remain was compatible  with  Article  8)  made
clear that the critical issue was generally whether, giving  due  weight  to
the strength of the public interest in removal,  the  article  8  claim  was
sufficiently  strong  to  outweigh  it.   There  is  no  suggestion  of  any
threshold to be overcome before proportionality can be fully considered.

17. Section 117B of the 2002 Act tells me that  immigration  control  is  in
the public interest.  In AM (S  117B)  Malawi  [2015]  UKUT  260  (IAC)  the
Tribunal held that an appellant can obtain no positive right to a  grant  of
leave to remain from either s117B (2) or (3), whatever  the  degree  of  his
fluency in English, or the strength of his financial  resources.  In  Forman
(ss 117A-C considerations) [2015] UKUT 00412 (IAC)  it  was  held  that  the
public  interest  in  firm  immigration  control  is  not  diluted  by   the
consideration that a person pursuing a claim under Article 8 ECHR has at  no
time been a financial burden on  the  state  or  is  self-sufficient  or  is
likely to remain so indefinitely.  The  significance  of  these  factors  is
that where they are not present the public interest is fortified.

18. On the facts as I find them to be, family life exists. On the facts  as
I find them to be the appellant meets the requirements of  the  immigration
rules.

19. The respondent's position is that all article 8 ECHR considerations are
embraced by the Immigration Rules. The fact that I find that the  appellant
meets  the  requirements  of  the  immigration  rules  indicates  that  the
respondent has a willingness to grant leave  to  enter.   The  respondent's
decision must therefore be  a  disproportionate  breach  of  the  right  to
respect for family life. The  respondent's  own  rules  indicate  that  the
decision is a disproportionate interference with the right to  respect  for
family life.

20. Family life within the meaning of article  8  is  established  for  the
appellants. The respondent's decision is an interference with  that  family
life. The burden therefore shifts  to  the  respondent  to  show  that  the
interference was justified. The respondent  relies  solely  on  the  public
interest in effective immigration control.

21. The refusal of entry clearance must  therefore  be  a  disproportionate
breach of the right to respect for family life. The respondent's own  rules
and  the  respondent's  own  guidance  indicate  that  the  decision  is  a
disproportionate interference with the right to respect for family life.

22. In Mostafa (Article 8 in entry clearance) [2015] UKUT 112 (IAC) it  was
held that the decision in Shamin Box [2002] UKIAT 02212 is to  be  followed
and that the obligation imposed by Article 8 is to promote the family  life
of those affected by the decision.

23.  In Mostafa (Article 8 in entry clearance) [2015]  UKUT  112  (IAC)  the
Tribunal  further  held  that  the  claimant's  ability   to   satisfy   the
Immigration Rules is not the question to be determined by the Tribunal,  but
is capable of  being  a  weighty,  though  not  determinative,  factor  when
deciding whether such refusal is proportionate  to  the  legitimate  aim  of
enforcing immigration control. At paragraph 9 it was  said  that  where  the
ground of appeal is limited to human  rights  "  Clearly  there  can  be  no
question of entertaining an appeal on grounds  alleging  that  the  decision
was not in accordance with the law or the immigration rules. These  are  not
permissible grounds. However if ...the claimant has shown that refusing  him
entry ... does interfere with his ...family life then it will  be  necessary
to assess the evidence to see if the claimant meets  the  substance  of  the
rules. This is because... the ability to satisfy the rules  illuminates  the
proportionality of the decision to refuse him entry clearance".

24.  At paragraph 23 the Upper Tribunal said "We have  considered  carefully
the effect that this decision could have in other cases. Plainly  this  will
mean that the underlying  merits  of  an  application  and  the  ability  to
satisfy  the  Immigration  Rules,  although  not  the  question  before  the
Tribunal, may be capable of being a weighty factor in  an  appeal  based  on
human rights but they will not  be  determinative.  They  will  only  become
relevant if the interference is such as to engage Article 8(1)  ECHR  and  a
finding by the Tribunal that an appellant does satisfy the  requirements  of
the rules will not necessarily lead  to  a  finding  that  the  decision  to
refuse  entry  clearance  is  disproportionate  to  the  proper  purpose  of
enforcing immigration control. However, it may be capable of being a  strong
reason for allowing the appeal that must be weighed with  the  others  facts
in the case.  ".

25. The fact that the appellant meets every requirement of  the  immigration
rules is an indicator that  the  respondent  accepts  that  the  balance  of
proportionality weighs in  the  appellant's  favour,  and  that  the  public
interest embodied in immigration control does not demand that the  appellant
and her sponsor should be forced to live apart.

26.  This appeal succeeds on article 8 ECHR (family life) grounds.

Decision

The appeal is allowed on article 8 ECHR grounds.

CONCLUSION

The decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  promulgated  on  16  May  2017  is
tainted by a material error of law.  I set it aside.

I substitute my own decision.

The appeal is allowed on article 8 ECHR grounds.
