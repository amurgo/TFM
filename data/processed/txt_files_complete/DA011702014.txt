                                  Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal made an order  pursuant  to  rule  45(4)(i)  of  the
Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.

I continue that order (pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008) and consequently, this  determination  identifies  the
appellant by initials only.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant in this appeal is the Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
    Department and to  avoid  confusion  I  shall  refer  to  her  as  "the
    claimant".  The respondent is a 36 year old male  citizen  of  Jamaica.
    He landed at Gatwick Airport on 12th June, 1998 and  sought  entry  for
    two months to visit his mother, who at the time  was  resident  in  the
    United Kingdom.  Entry was refused and removal directions were set  for
    14th June, 1998, but on 13th June, the respondent claimed asylum.   His
    claim was refused on 23rd November, 1998, and  on  23rd  December  that
    year the respondent appealed.

2.   The respondent claims to have married J M, a British citizen,  on  29th
    April 1999, but no certificate was submitted  to  the  Home  Office  to
    verify this claim.  On 12th  October,  1999,  the  respondent's  asylum
    appeal was dismissed.  On 20th December, 1999, the  respondent  applied
    for an extension of stay as the husband of a settled person and on 16th
    August 2001, he applied for indefinite leave to remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom as the spouse of a settled person, J  W.   The  respondent  was
    granted indefinite leave to remain on 14th September, 2001.

3.   On 18th June, 2002, the respondent was convicted  at  Manchester  Crown
    Court of possessing a controlled drug with intent to  supply,  class  A
    heroin, and with possessing a class A drug with intent to supply, class
    A crack cocaine, and he was sentenced to  three  years  six  months  in
    respect of both offences.  The appellant served his  sentence  and  was
    released from custody on 8th December, 2003.

4.   The respondent's first child, L-W W was born in the United  Kingdom  to
    his then partner, S S.  His second child, L W was born  on  15th  June,
    2006, to J B.  On 17th April, 2008, the respondent's third child,  Y  W
    was born in the United Kingdom to S S.  The respondent married J  B  on
    25th January, 2011, from whom he is now  separated.   Unfortunately  on
    22nd July, 2011, the respondent was convicted of handling stolen  goods
    and given a twelve month conditional discharge and ordered to pay costs
    of ï¿½85 at Manchester City Magistrates' Court.  On 10th June, 2012,  the
    respondent's fourth child, D'A W was born in the United Kingdom to  his
    wife, J W.

5.   On 14th April, 2013, the respondent submitted an application for  a  no
    time limit stamp be endorsed on his passport and it appears  that  this
    application prompted the claimant to issue a  form  ICD0350,  liability
    for deportation letter, addressed to the respondent.  The claimant made
    a decision on 10th June, 2014 to make a deportation order under Section
    5(1) of the Immigration Act 1971 in respect of the respondent  and  the
    respondent appealed to the First-tier Tribunal against that decision.

6.   His appeal was heard here in Manchester on 13th August, 2014, by First-
    tier Tribunal Judge De Haney.  The  sentencing  remarks  of  the  Crown
    Court Judge at the hearing on 18th June, 2002, were not made  available
    to the First-tier Tribunal, but it was clear to Judge De Haney that the
    claimant  took  no  action  to  deport  the  respondent  following  his
    conviction.  The judge noted the respondent's various relationships and
    children and noted that all four of them are British subjects as  is  S
    S.  The judge found, at paragraph 45 of  his  determination,  that  the
    appellant had a genuine and subsisting  parental  relationship  with  a
    qualifying child and was satisfied on the evidence before him that  the
    effect of the respondent's deportation on that child  would  be  unduly
    harsh.  He found this in respect of L-W W, who was 9 and Y W, who is  6
    as well.  He believed that there were also arguments for  reaching  the
    same conclusion in respect of the respondent's other two children.   He
    made findings in respect of Section 117B of the 2002 Act, finding  that
    the appellant is a fluent  English  speaker,  economically  financially
    independent, that the relationship was formed when he was in the United
    Kingdom lawfully, that the relationship was formed when his immigration
    status was not precarious and indeed he had  leave  to  remain  and  he
    found that it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave  the
    United Kingdom.  He allowed the respondent's appeal.

6.   The claimant challenged the  decision,  claiming  first  in  some  sour
    paragraphs that the judge had failed to take properly into account  the
    public interest in deporting foreign criminals.  The grounds  drew  the
    Tribunal's attention to  the  decision  of  Lord  Justice  Laws  in  SS
    (Nigeria) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] EWCA Civ.
    550, that  the  public  interest  in  deporting  foreign  criminals  is
    pressing and that the  interest  would  be  hindered  where  a  foreign
    criminal was not deported for a serious offence.  The second  challenge
    suggested that the judge had erred in allowing the appeal under Section
    399A of the Immigration Rules HC 395, as amended.

7.   Mr Harrison was not able to assist me by  throwing  any  light  on  the
    reasons why there was a twelve year delay before making the deportation
    order  but,  like  me,  he  suspected  that  it  was  the  respondent's
    application  for  indefinite  leave  that  triggered  the   deportation
    proceedings.

8.   Mr Harrison accepted that at paragraph 45  of  his  determination,  the
    judge found that Section 117C(5) was applicable in that the  respondent
    had a genuine and subsisting relationship with a qualifying  child  and
    the effect of his deportation on  the  child  would  be  unduly  harsh.
    There are two such children that the judge made that finding in respect
    of although he suspected that in fact he would have  been  entitled  to
    make that finding in respect of the other two children as well.

9.   At paragraph 46 he dealt with Section  117B  and  at  paragraph  47  he
    said, "I  find  then  that  these  public  interest  considerations  in
    assessing Article 8 are outweighed in the particular  circumstances  of
    this appeal" so that it was at that stage that he actually allowed  the
    appeal.

10.  He then went on and referred erroneously to  paragraph  299(a)  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  His reference of  course  was  intended  to  be  to
    399(a) and I accept that he may have been wrong in what he said, but  I
    do not accept that it was material, because by the time he had  reached
    paragraph  48  of  his  determination  he  had  already   allowed   the
    respondent's appeal.

11.  Given that the claimant is not in a position to offer  any  explanation
    to me as to why it took her twelve years to make the deportation  order
    following the respondent's conviction, I believe  that  the  judge  was
    entitled to believe in the circumstances that the  public  interest  in
    deporting this respondent was not  particularly  pressing.   It  cannot
    properly be said that it is in the public interest that there should be
    a delay of twelve years before any decision is made to deport a foreign
    criminal and the longer there is between the  date  of  conviction  and
    date of the decision of the Secretary of State to  make  a  deportation
    order, the less pressing the public interest in deporting  the  foreign
    criminal becomes.

12.  Inevitably there will be delays in making deportation orders  following
    conviction because of course  the  Secretary  of  State  will  wish  to
    collect and consider relevant evidence and often  one  sees  delays  of
    one, sometimes two and occasionally  even  three  years.   Those  cases
    however are in a completely different category  to  this.   To  suggest
    that the First-tier Judge has  failed  properly  to  weigh  the  public
    interest in removing the foreign criminal with young children with whom
    he is in a genuine and subsisting parental  relationship,  following  a
    delay of twelve years, without offering any explanation at all for  the
    delay does not reveal an error of law on his part.

13.  In the circumstances I find  that  the  claimant's  challenge  to  this
    determination must fail.  I am satisfied that the  decision  of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge De Haney involved the making of no error on a point
    of law and I uphold his decision.
