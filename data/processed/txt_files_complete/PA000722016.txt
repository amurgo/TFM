                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:     Ms N Loughran, of Loughran & Co, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals against a determination  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Blair, promulgated on 22 November 2016.

 2. The judge found at �33 that  the  appellant  "had  established  both  a
    subjective and objective fear if returned to his home area".   However,
    he went on to find at �37-38 that as the appellant is "undocumented  at
    this time", his protection claim failed.

 3. The appeal to the UT is on grounds of  failing  to  apply  the  country
    guidance in AA, and failing to deal with submissions regarding internal
    relocation to Baghdad or to the IKR.

 4. A rule 24 response to the grant of permission concedes error of law.

 5. Current lack of documentation does not require appellants  who  do  not
    otherwise qualify  to  be  granted  protection;  but  current  lack  of
    documentation  does  not  bar  anyone  from  protection,  or  shut  off
    consideration of internal relocation.

 6. The decision of the FtT is set aside. Its findings of fact, as  to  the
    appellant's well-founded fear in respect of his home area at  the  date
    of the hearing, stand.

 7.  The  further  factual  analysis  required  to  resolve  the   internal
    relocation and overall protection issue is apt for remittal to the FtT.

 8. The member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case are not to include
    Judge Blair.

 9. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.

10. Parties are to file and exchange, not  less  than  7  days  before  the
    hearing in the FtT, a note of their positions, referenced to  case  law
    and background evidence, on why the appellant, on the findings of  fact
    so far made, does or does not qualify for any form of protection.
