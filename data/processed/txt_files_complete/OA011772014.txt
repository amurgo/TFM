Chambers
For the Respondent:    Miss A Fijiwala, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a national of Lebanon. She is  the  mother  of  S  who
    resides in the UK as an EEA qualified person.  Her application  for  an
    EEA family permit was refused on 10 January 2014.  On 10 December  2015
    First-tier Tribunal (FtT) Judge E Grant dismissed  her  appeal  because
    she did not consider the appellant was a  dependent  on  S  within  the
    meaning of regulation 7 of the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2006.

2.   The appellant's grounds of appeal  relied  first  of  all  on  (i)  the
    judge's acceptance that the appellant's  daughter  had  sent  money  to
    Lebanon; and (ii) the documentary evidence of monthly remittances for a
    substantial period of time of approximately  �100  per  month.  On  the
    basis of (i) and (ii), it was contended  that  the  judge  should  have
    concluded that the appellant satisfied the requirements  of  regulation
    17(1)(e). Second it  was  submitted  that  the  judge  had  misdirected
    herself  by  considering  peripheral  matters  relating  to  the  legal
    ownership of the apartment in which the appellant resides and the issue
    of who had paid one of S's brother's university fees  in  the  UK  many
    years  ago.  Criticism  was  also  made  of  the  judge's  reliance  on
    speculation (as to whether  the  appellant  has  a  state  pension  and
    whether S's other siblings are in a position to support  the  appellant
    and the adequacy of the reasons given by the judge for finding S "vague
    and evasive" even though in a different appeal before the  UT  she  had
    been found a credible witness.

3.   In  amplifying  the  appellant's  grounds  Mr  Rashid  highlighted  the
    lengthy delay between the date of application (19  December  2013)  and
    the refusal decision (10 January 2014) and between the  lodging  of  an
    appeal and then eventual First-tier Tribunal  decision  now  challenged
    (the first hearing before Judge Pullig having to be  abandoned  because
    of his ill health).

4.   Mr Rashid urged me to take account of the fact that  S's  evidence  was
    that she did not take full responsibility for supporting the  appellant
    until April 2013. The appellant's situation  was  very  different  from
    that considered by the Court of Appeal in  Lim  [2015]  EWCA  Civ  1383
    where that appellant had a home worth �80,000 and significant  savings.
    Mr Rashid also underlined the submission that the judge  was  wrong  to
    portray the sponsor S as vague and evasive, particularly given  that  S
    had been found credible by the UT in a separate appeal relating to  the
    appellant's daughter living with her in Lebanon, and  wrong  to  expect
    the sponsor or the appellant or know who  paid  the  brother's  student
    fees. Even if the judge was entitled to find that  the  appellant  owns
    the flat she lives in Lebanon, that property did not provide  her  with
    material support.

5.   Miss Fijiwala submitted that Mr Rashid was wrong to  say  that  the  CA
    case of Lim helped his client as it made clear that  to  qualify  as  a
    dependant a family member of an EEA national had to show they were in a
    situation of real dependency whereas the  findings made  by  the  judge
    regarding this appellant were that she  had  a  property  which  was  a
    realisable asset and that the appellant had not  established  that  any
    dependency she had was on S in particular, given  that  other  siblings
    had supported the appellant in the past.

6.   It will assist if I set out in full the judge's principal  findings  in
    paragraph 8:

         "The Entry Clearance Officer had had a concern that in  a  relevant
         application the appellant said she owned the apartment she lived in
         but in the current application she had made she says  she  owns  no
         property. The sponsor was asked to  explain  this  discrepancy  and
         what she said was 'She means my father's property it is in his name
         it is hers but in the second she needs not actual because it in the
         father's name'.  She  confirmed  her  father  and  the  appellant's
         husband is deceased. The sponsor went on to say  the  property  was
         still in her father's name.  The family did not want to transfer it
         to any other person while their mother was still living there. When
         asked who owned it now she said 'We didn't  transfer  it  into  any
         other names we don't want to distribute the inheritance now because
         mother needs a property to live in that is all I know'. She went on
         to explain that according to Islam the property can be  contributed
         to the children if it sold 'But we don't have intention to sell  it
         because mother is living there'."

7.   It will also assist to set out the  guidance  given  by  the  Court  of
    Appeal in Lim at [32]. Having analysed the recent jurisprudence of  the
    Court of Justice the most recent being Reyes v Migratinsverket  2014/C-
    423/12 [2014] 28 114D, Elias LJ concluded:

         "32. In my judgement, the critical question is whether the claimant
             is in fact in a position to support himself or not, and  Reyes
             now makes it clear beyond doubt, in my view. That is a  simple
             material of fact.  If he can  support  himself,  there  is  no
             dependency, even if he is given financial material support  by
             the EU citizen.  Those additional resources are not  necessary
             to enable him to meet his basic needs. If, on the other  hand,
             he cannot support himself from his own  resources,  the  court
             will not ask why that is the case, save perhaps where there is
             an abuse of rights. The fact that he chooses not to get a  job
             and become self-supporting is irrelevant.  It follows that  on
             the facts of this case there was no dependency. The  appellant
             has  the  funds  to  support  herself.  She  was   financially
             independent and did not need the additional resources for  the
             purpose of meeting her basics needs."

8.   I do not consider that the grounds succeed in  establishing  any  error
    of law.

9.   As regards the judge's findings of fact, it was entirely  open  to  her
    to find that the appellant in fact owned the flat in Lebanon.  In  that
    regard the judge was  entitled  to  have  regard  to  the  inconsistent
    evidence the appellant had given about this. Her late husband had owned
    it and there was nothing to show that its ownership had not  passed  to
    her as the next of kin.  As  regards  the  judge's  findings  that  the
    appellant had not shown she was as claimed dependent on the sponsor, it
    was equally open to her to find the sponsor's existence as regards  the
    situation of the other  seven   (adult  )  children  unsatisfactory  in
    respect of whether they provided any financial support to the appellant
    or not and, if not, why  not.  The  judge  was  entitled  to  treat  as
    significant  the  accepted  fact  that  other  siblings  including  the
    appellant's businessman brother had supported the appellant in the past
    and there was insufficient evidence to establish that S  (who  had  her
    own family) would have become the only member of the family to  support
    the appellant.

10.  Mr Rashid's principal basis for saying that  the  judge's  findings  of
    fact were vitiated by legal error was the fact that S had been found to
    be a credible witness by the UT  in  the  context  of  the  appellant's
    daughter's appeal.  However, as is apparent from para 8 of the  judge's
    decision cited earlier, the judge took this fact into account and it is
    clear from her decision why she decided to take  a  different  view.  I
    would observe that  in  any  event  the  UT's  decision  concerned  the
    credibility of S's evidence about financial support for the  sister  as
    at the time  of  the  respondent's  decision  in  that  case.   In  the
    appellant's case the remittance  evidence  was  almost  entirely  post-
    decision and in any event the judge's decision did not dispute  that  S
    provided some financial assistance; what the judge did not accept  that
    such assistance had been shown to be essential to meet the  appellant's
    basic needs.

11.  With regard to the documentary evidence, it did show  in  the  form  of
    fourteen remittance slips from January 2014 to October  2015  averaging
    almost �100 over months sent by S to  the  appellant  in  Lebanon,  but
    given the lack of evidence about the circumstances under which  it  was
    claimed the other  seven  siblings  had  ceased  to  help  finance  the
    appellant, the fact that there was no evidence relating to the previous
    12 months prior to the date of decision was significant.

12.  Mr Rashid has sought to argue that even on the  basis  of  the  judge's
    finding that the appellant  owned  her  flat,  the  correct  conclusion
    should have been applying the guidance given in Lim, that the appellant
    had established that at the date of decision she was in a situation  of
    dependency.  I cannot agree.  First of all the judge's finding was  not
    that the appellant had no other financial means.   Second,  as  already
    noted, the evidence of support from the  sponsor  covering  the  period
    from which she claimed to have become the  appellant's  sole  financial
    provider, April 2013 to the present was singularly lacking; there being
    only evidence beginning in the same month as the date  of  decision  in
    January 2014.

 13. For the above reasons I conclude firstly that the judge's  findings  of
    fact are unimpeachable and secondly that on the basis of these findings
    it was plainly open to her to conclude that the appellant had not shown
    that at the date of decision she was dependent on S within the  meaning
    of regulation 7 of the 2006 Regulations.

14.  To conclude:

    The FtT judge did not materially err in law.  The decision of  the  FtT
    judge must stand.

No anonymity direction is made.
