Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr B Lams, Counsel, instructed by The Legal Resource

For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an error of law hearing in the first  instance  in  respect  of
    the appellant's appeal against the decision  of  the  First-tier  Judge
    dismissing his appeal against the decision to remove him as an  illegal
    entrant.  I will not go  into  the  background  in  any  great  detail.
    Essentially there were four matters raised in the grounds and the grant
    of permission is limited to the challenge in respect of  two  of  those
    and wisely I think Mr Lams concentrated his submissions  on  those  two
    points.  So I do not think I need to  say  anything  more  about  those
    except to note in passing that the judge found in  circumstances  which
    are not open to challenge that  the  requirements  of  the  Immigration
    Rules were not satisfied in this case.

2.   So it comes down really to whether it is shown that there is  an  error
    or there are errors of law in the judge's assessment of Article 8 other
    than within the Rules and perhaps on this point it is helpful  to  turn
    to paragraph 25 of the determination.

         "As to Article 8 I accept that the  appellant  is  currently  in  a
         relationship with  Ms  Tran.   After  considering  the  letters  of
         support contained within the appellant's bundle I am also satisfied
         that he has a number of friends in the United Kingdom.  I am  aware
         that the threshold for engagement in respect of Article  8  is  not
         particularly  high.   I   have   decided   that   the   appellant's
         relationship with Ms Tran and the fact that  she  is  of  different
         religion  to  him   could   potentially   amount   to   exceptional
         circumstances and so I am  satisfied  there  are  good  reasons  to
         consider Article 8 in accordance with MM (Lebanon) and/or  went  on
         to set out the five Razgar questions and to address those."

3.   The two particular points of concern as set  out  by  Mr  Lams  in  the
    grounds and  reasserted  today  are  that  there  is  no  consideration
    thereafter of the implications of the fact that Ms Tran is  a  Buddhist
    and how she would manage as a Buddhist married or in a relationship  to
    a Muslim, which is the appellant's religion, in  Bangladesh,  which  is
    his country, and also the fact that although it was said by  the  judge
    that it was unlikely that the requirements of the Rules would be met if
    a fresh application was made now, this is the second  point  today,  in
    effect the evidence shows that Ms Tran was earning comfortably over the
    ï¿½18,600 limit and it is said that is a matter that had to  be  factored
    into the evaluation of Article 8 outside the Rules,  this  having  been
    identified by the judge as a  relevant  issue  that  these  matters  or
    particular matters that he referred to  could   amount  to  exceptional
    circumstances.

4.   I think that perhaps slightly turning Mr Melvin's submissions on  their
    head, I find it difficult  to  see  how  these  matters  could  not  be
    relevant in assessing Article 8 outside the Rules and it is not a  case
    where it can possibly be said that everything that can be of  relevance
    in this case is a matter that can be dealt with and is dealt with under
    the Immigration Rules.  The judge  herself  identified  the  particular
    matter and the matter on which Mr Lams has placed most weight, that  of
    the difficulties that the Buddhist partner of a  Muslim  in  Bangladesh
    might face.  This a matter that was ignored by the judge although there
    was clearly evidence before her concerning difficulties in this regard,
    that is a matter that clearly needed to be addressed if a consideration
    of exceptional circumstances was to be full and proper, and to a lesser
    extent although still relevantly part of the exercise that needed to be
    addressed was the fact that Ms Tran's earnings are such as to mean that
    the requirements of the Rules in that respect at least could be met and
    that factors into the Chikwamba point mentioned by Mr Lams and as  part
    of the overall evaluation of Article 8 outside the Rules.

5.   So as a consequence I find there are errors of  law  in  this  decision
    with regard to both grounds 2 and 3 as developed  today  and  therefore
    the decision to that extent will have to be remade.
