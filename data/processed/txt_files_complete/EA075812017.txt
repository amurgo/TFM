Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr J Norman, instructed by Milestone solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr D Clarke, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

      1. The appellant sought and  was,  on  25th  August  2017,  refused  a
         residence card under regulation 9  Immigration  (European  Economic
         Area) Regulations 2016. By a  decision  promulgated  on  29th  June
         2018,  his  appeal  was  dismissed  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
         Housego. He sought and was granted permission to appeal; hence  the
         appeal came before me.

         Background

      2. The appellant has used a number of  names,  but  nothing  turns  on
         this. His wife and sponsor [RA] has also used a  number  of  names;
         again, nothing turns on this.

      3. Mr [O] is a Nigerian citizen, born in January 1988. His wife  is  a
         British Citizen born in the UK April 1990 and  has  lived  all  her
         life in Dagenham until she went to Nigeria. Mr [O]  first  came  to
         the UK in October 2009 as a student.  He  returned  to  Nigeria  on
         completion of  his  studies  in  October  2014.  He  and  his  wife
         commenced their relationship in 2014. In  October  2015,  his  wife
         went to Nigeria and they  were  married  there.  They  remained  in
         Nigeria; Mr [O] set up a business in Nigeria.

      4. On 18th January 2016, the couple travelled to Eire. Ms [A] was,  at
         that time pregnant. Their son was born in Eire in September 2016.

      5. On 3rd October 2016 the appellant was issued  with  an  EEA  Family
         Permit by the Irish authorities, valid until 3rd April  2017.  15th
         October  2016,  the  couple  were  issued  with   certificates   of
         registration. On 25th October 2016 Ms [A] and their son came to the
         UK; on 31st October 2016 the appellant  came  to  the  UK.  Ms  [A]
         commenced employment in the UK in February 2017.

      6. Ms [A] was employed in Eire from  15th  February  2016  until  14th
         August 2016 when she went on paid  maternity  leave;  she  resigned
         from her job (with Tarak International) on 25th December 2016.

         Error of law

      7. The application was  considered  under  regulation  9  of  the  EEA
         Regulations and was refused for  reasons  set  out  in  a  decision
         letter dated 30th August 2017.  The decision does not  state  which
         particular  sections  of  regulation  9  were  considered  by   the
         respondent to be applicable. The respondent concluded:

             "... The reasons for leaving the Republic of Ireland  are  not
             credible and indicate that it was  always  your  intention  to
             reside in the UK and that your residence in  the  Republic  of
             Ireland was for the purposes of this application.

             In view of the above findings  it  is  apparent  that  it  was
             always your intention to come and live in the UK and that your
             relatively short stay in the Republic of Ireland was merely to
             enable you to enter the UK under the EEA regulations, when you
             would  otherwise  not  have  qualified  for  entry  under  the
             immigration rules.

             As such it is deemed that you moved to the Republic of Ireland
             was for the sole purpose of gaining entry to the UK under  the
             Surinder Singh ruling  and  your  first  residence  with  your
             sponsor in the Republic of Ireland was in order to  circumvent
             immigration law.

             ...

             Having considered all of the evidence and information provided
             in support of your application, and  applying  the  civil  law
             standard of the balance of probabilities, it is  not  accepted
             that you and your British Citizen sponsor's residence  in  the
             EEA host country was genuine and it  is  considered  that  the
             purpose of your residence in the EEA host  country  was  as  a
             means for circumventing the UK's domestic Immigration Rules or
             other immigration law."

      8. Regulation 9 of the 2016 EEA Regulations reads as follows:

             9.-  (1) If the conditions in  paragraph  (2)  are  satisfied,
                  these Regulations apply to a  person  who  is  the  family
                  member ("F") of a British citizen ("BC") as though the  BC
                  were an EEA national.

                  (2)  The conditions are that-

                      (a)  BC-

                           (i)  is residing in an EEA  State  as  a  worker,
                           self-employed person, self-sufficient person or a
                           student,  or  so   resided   immediately   before
                           returning to the United Kingdom; or

                           (ii)  has  acquired  the   right   of   permanent
                           residence in an EEA State;

                      (b)  F and BC resided together in the EEA State; and

                      (c)  F and  BC's  residence  in  the  EEA  State  was
                      genuine.

                  (3)  Factors relevant to  whether  residence  in  the  EEA
                  State is or was genuine include-

                      (a)  whether the centre of BC's life  transferred  to
                      the EEA State;

                      (b)  the length of F and BC's joint residence in  the
                      EEA State;

                      (c)  the  nature  and  quality  of  the  F  and  BC's
                      accommodation in the EEA State, and whether it is  or
                      was BC's principal residence;

                      (d)  the degree of F and BC's integration in the  EEA
                      State;

                      (e)  whether F's first lawful  residence  in  the  EU
                      with BC was in the EEA State.

                  (4)  This regulation does not apply-

                      (a)  where the purpose of the residence  in  the  EEA
                      State  was  as  a   means   for   circumventing   any
                      immigration laws applying  to  non-EEA  nationals  to
                      which F would  otherwise  be  subject  (such  as  any
                      applicable requirement under the  1971  Act  to  have
                      leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom); or

                      (b)t o a person who is only eligible to be treated as
                      a family  member  as  a  result  of  regulation  7(3)
                      (extended family members treated as family members).

                  (5)  Where these Regulations apply  to  F,  BC  is  to  be
                  treated as holding a valid passport issued by an EEA State
                  for the purposes of the application of  these  Regulations
                  to F.

                  (6)  In paragraph (2)(a)(ii), BC is only to be treated  as
                  having acquired the right of permanent  residence  in  the
                  EEA  State  if  such  residence  would  have  led  to  the
                  acquisition of that right  under  regulation  15,  had  it
                  taken place in the United Kingdom.

                  (7)   For  the  purposes  of  determining  whether,   when
                  treating the BC as an EEA national under these Regulations
                  in accordance with paragraph (1), BC would be a  qualified
                  person-

                      (a)  any requirement to have  comprehensive  sickness
                      insurance cover in the United Kingdom still  applies,
                      save that it does not require the cover to extend  to
                      BC;

                      (b)  in assessing  whether  BC  can  continue  to  be
                      treated as a worker under regulation 6(2)(b) or  (c),
                      BC is not required to satisfy condition A;

                      (c)  in assessing whether BC  can  be  treated  as  a
                      jobseeker as defined in regulation 6(1),  BC  is  not
                      required to satisfy conditions A and, where it  would
                      otherwise be relevant, condition C.

      9. The First-tier  Tribunal  judge  set  out  the  evidence  and  made
         findings:

             "17. This does not mean that they did not centre  their  lives
             there. However this was only ever going to be an  intermediate
             step...They needed the permit to get the  appellant  into  the
             UK, and as soon as they got it they came to the UK.

             ...

             22.  Accordingly  all  the  reasons  given  are  not  genuine.
             Ireland was only ever a staging post  so  that  the  appellant
             could return to the UK with the sponsor even  though  she  did
             not earn enough money to bring him into Nigeria [sic].

             ...

             26.  The residence in Ireland was not genuine. The steps taken
             were to get Irish residency in order to leave for  the  UK.  I
             have considered the factors in 9(3) in so concluding. This was
             not the first state in which they cohabited. The residence was
             short and ended as soon as the necessary permit was  obtained.
             The evidence of integration is largely of pragmatics such as a
             bank account and medical treatment required by reason  of  the
             pregnancy of the sponsor.

             27.  ...The reason the appellant and his sponsor went to  Eire
             was because the  appellant  could  not  be  sponsored  by  his
             British citizen wife to come to the UK as she was not  earning
             �18,600, and is still not doing so. It was always intended  to
             be a stepping stone to the UK. Accordingly the  provisions  of
             regulation 9 are not met ..."

     10. The appellant sought permission, and  was  granted  permission,  to
         appeal on the grounds[1]:

                   i) 5.   Wrong burden of proof

                  "in considering this appeal the Judge should bear in  mind
                  that it is for the appellant  to  show  on  a  balance  of
                  probabilities that he satisfied the  requirements  of  the
                  immigration rules ..."

                  6.   it is contended that where a  decision  to  refuse  a
                  residence card is premised upon the  conclusion  that  the
                  purpose of the British Citizen and non-EEA family member's
                  residence  in  an  EEA  state  was  "...as  a   means   of
                  circumventing any immigration laws...(paragraph  9(4)  EEA
                  Regs), the burden of proving that intention lies with  the
                  respondent. As such the FTT Judge has  adopted  a  legally
                  erroneous approach.

                  ...

                  ii) 11.  Irrational consideration regs 9(1)(c)  and  9(4)
                      EEA regs

                  12. "The  question  this  appeal  raises  is  whether  the
                  purpose of  their  residence  in  the  EEA  state  was  to
                  circumvent the requirements of the Immigration [Rules]  to
                  which the applicant would otherwise have been subject

                  13. It is contended that the FTT's findings are flawed:

                  Paragraph 10(3)

                  14. The findings are however materially erroneous since:

                  15. The FTT judge has, irrationally and unlawfully,  given
                  no weight to the factors  supporting  the  extent  of  the
                  Appellant's family's integration in Ireland, by failing to
                  treat them as supporting the Appellant's case, the judge

                  16. The Judge  failed  to  properly  apply  Reg  9(3)  EEA
                  regs....

                  ..."

     11. The skeleton argument and oral submissions  clarified  the  grounds
         relied upon, essentially submitting that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
         judge had applied the incorrect burden and standard of proof and as
         a result of that  had  approached  the  evidence  incorrectly.  The
         respondent  submitted  that  the  issue  of  burden  of  proof  was
         misconceived because there had been no  allegation  of  fraud;  the
         issue had been whether the residence in Ireland had  been  genuine.
         He submitted that the judge's findings were open to  him  and  were
         conclusions it was open to him to draw from the evidence.

     12. The respondent does not,  in  the  reasons  for  refusal,  set  out
         whether the decision was taken under regulation 9(3) or 9(4). It is
         therefore necessary to look at the language used by the  respondent
         in formulating the refusal. It cannot be  otherwise  than  that  he
         reached  the  conclusion  that  the  appellant  and  his  wife  had
         perpetrated a fraud contrary to regulation 9(4). Although there are
         references to the evidence  in  the  context  of  the  criteria  in
         regulation 9(3), the overwhelming conclusion by the respondent  was
         that the move to Ireland was for the sole purpose of  circumventing
         UK immigration control - see extract from the  decision  letter  in
         paragraph 7 above.

     13. The First-tier Tribunal judge does not address  that  assertion  by
         the respondent as an allegation of fraud. There is  no  attempt  by
         the judge to consider the burden of proof of such an allegation but
         rather the judge considers the evidence and reaches  findings  that
         go to support that assertion in the context of the burden of  proof
         being upon the appellant  -  see  paragraph  7  of  the  First-tier
         Tribunal decision. Furthermore, the  judge  incorrectly  considered
         the motivation of the couple as  oppose  to  whether  there  was  a
         genuine (effective) exercise of Treaty rights.

     14. The First-tier Tribunal judge erred in law such that  the  decision
         is set aside to be remade, no findings preserved.

     15. The substance of the First-tier Tribunal decision is such that none
         of the findings can be relied upon; all are infected by the lack of
         proper approach to the burden of proof. The scheme of the Tribunals
         Court and Enforcement Act 2007 does  not  assign  the  function  of
         primary fact finding to the Upper Tribunal. I conclude that  it  is
         appropriate for this  appeal  to  be  remitted  to  the  First-tier
         Tribunal for  a  full  hearing,  applying  the  proper  burden  and
         standard of proof, to enable adequate reasoned findings to be made.



    Conclusions:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

    I set aside the  decision  and  remit  the  appeal  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal to be heard afresh.
