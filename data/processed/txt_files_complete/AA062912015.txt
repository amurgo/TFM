               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     Mr K H Forrest, Advocate; Livingstone Brown,
Solicitors

For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a citizen of Morocco, born on [ ] 1984.   He  has  not
    sought an anonymity order, and none has been made.

 2. The appellant made an asylum  claim  on  12th  March  2015,  which  the
    respondent refused on 2nd April 2015.

 3. The appellant appealed to the  First-tier  Tribunal.   His  appeal  was
    firstly  dealt  with  through  the  "fast  track"  procedure,  and  was
    dismissed in terms of a decision and  reasons  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Raymond, promulgated on 20th April 2015.

 4. On 25th September 2015 the President of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  set
    aside that decision and directed that the appeal  be  re-determined  by
    another judge.

 5. First-tier Tribunal Judge Handley dismissed the appeal by decision  and
    reasons promulgated on 26th January 2016.

 6. Before Judge Handley the appellant was neither present nor represented,
    which may have been due to a procedural mishap.  It  appears  that  the
    respondent's Presenting Officer invited the judge to  apply  Devaseelan
    [2002] UKAIT 00702 and to take the decision by  Judge  Raymond  as  the
    starting point.

 7. Mr Matthews fairly and correctly conceded that Judge Handley fell  into
    error by taking the  earlier  decision  as  the  starting  point.   The
    decision of Judge Raymond had been set aside and the case  required  to
    be decided entirely afresh.  Under those circumstances, Devaseelan  was
    not an appropriate reference.

 8. The decision by Judge Handley is set aside.  No findings of the  First-
    tier Tribunal, at any previous date, are  to  stand.   Those  decisions
    stand only as a record of what was said at  the  time.   Under  section
    12(2)(b)(i) of the 2007 Act and Practice Statement 7.2 the  nature  and
    extent of judicial fact finding necessary for the decision  to  be  re-
    made is such that it is appropriate to remit the case to the First-tier
    Tribunal.  The member(s) of the First-tier Tribunal chosen  to  be  re-
    consider the case are not to include Judge Raymond or Judge Handley.
