For the Respondent:    Ms A Christie, Counsel, instructed by Hubers Law


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State for the  Home  Department
       (SSHD) against the decision  of  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       Thorne (the judge), promulgated on  7  February  2018,  allowing  the
       appeal of Mr Islam (hereafter claimant) against the SSHD's  decision,
       dated 31 October 2017, refusing his human rights claim.



   Background

    2. The claimant is a national of Bangladesh, born in November  1991.  He
       entered the UK as a Tier 4 (General) Student on 18 January  2010.  He
       made further applications for leave to remain in the same capacity on
       31 October 2011 and 28 August  2013.  Both  these  applications  were
       granted. In each application he relied on an English  language  TOEIC
       certificate obtained from Educational Testing Service  (ETS),  having
       claimed to have undertaken a speaking test at Elizabeth College on 18
       October 2011.

    3. On 20 February 2015 the claimant married his British citizen partner,
       Nadira Alam Nadi (the partner). On 22 May 2015, the  day  before  his
       leave expired, the claimant applied for further leave to remain based
       on his family/private life. Although the Reasons for  Refusal  Letter
       refers to the claimant as only being given an out-of-country right of
       appeal, Mr Tufan,  representing  the  SSHD  at  the  'error  of  law'
       hearing, confirmed that the claimant did in fact have  an  in-country
       appeal. The appeal was dismissed. The claimant then  made  the  human
       rights claim that  is  the  subject  of  these  proceedings.  In  his
       decision dated 31 October 2017 the respondent was not satisfied  that
       the claimant met the Suitability requirements of Appendix FM  of  the
       immigration rules. The respondent  explained  that  ETS  undertook  a
       check of the English language speaking test taken by the claimant  on
       18 October 2011 and that the test result was cancelled. On the  basis
       of the information provided to him the SSHD was  satisfied  that  the
       certificate was fraudulently obtained, and  that  the  claimant  used
       deception in his applications dated 31 October  2011  and  28  August
       2013. The SSHD  was  not  therefore  satisfied  that  the  claimant's
       presence was conducive to the public good  and  his  application  was
       refused under S-LTR.1.6 of Appendix FM.

    4. It is pertinent to note that the SSHD accepted that the claimant  met
       the Eligibility requirements of Section E-LTRP of  Appendix  FM,  and
       specifically  stated  that   the   requirements   of   paragraph   R-
       LTRP.1.1.(c)(ii) were met. No issue  was  therefore  taken  with  the
       Relationship requirements, the Immigration Status  requirements,  the
       Financial requirements, or the English  language  requirements.  This
       reflected the content of the covering letter accompanying  the  human
       rights claim, which referred to various  documents  accompanying  the
       application in respect of Appendix FM-SE  and  the  English  language
       requirements. There was no suggestion  in  the  parties'  submissions
       that the claimant had ever remained in the UK without  lawful  leave,
       either pursuant to leave granted by the SSHD, or pursuant to  section
       3C of the Immigration Act 1971. This  was  a  point  accepted  by  Mr
       Tufan.

    5. The SSHD went on to consider whether  the  requirements  of  EX.1  of
       Appendix FM were met,  but  he  was  not  satisfied  there  were  any
       'insurmountable obstacles' preventing  the  couple  continuing  their
       relationship in Bangladesh. nor was the SSHD satisfied there were any
       exceptional circumstances sufficient to warrant a grant of  leave  to
       remain outsider the immigration rules on human rights grounds.

The First-tier Tribunal decision

    6. The SSHD was not represented by a Presenting Officer  at  the  First-
       tier Tribunal hearing. The SSHD only provided a Supplementary  Bundle
       of documents on the  day  of  the  hearing,  and  then  only  to  the
       Tribunal. The Supplementary Bundle  contained,  inter  alia,  generic
       statements from Peter Millington  and  Rebecca  Collings,  an  expert
       report  from  Professor  French,  a  3-page  copy   of   a   criminal
       investigation  entitled  'Project  Faï¿½ade'  relating   to   Elizabeth
       College, and, crucially, the ETS results relating to  the  claimant's
       English-speaking test, marked as 'questionable.'

    7. Having set out the documents before him, including the 'questionable'
       test result, and having properly identified the correct standard  and
       burden of proof (noting, with reference to SM and Qadir v SSHD (ETS -
       Evidence - Burden of Proof) [2016] UKUT 229, that  the  SSHD  had  to
       discharge the initial evidential burden, that the  evidential  burden
       then  'shifted'  to  the  claimant  to  offer  a  plausible  innocent
       explanation, and, if discharged, that the SSHD had to then  meet  the
       legal  burden  of  establishing  dishonesty   on   the   balance   of
       probabilities), the  judge  summarised  the  evidence  given  by  the
       claimant and his wife at the hearing. This evidence included  details
       of the claimant's attendance at the test centre, the amount  he  paid
       to undertake the test, his previous study of the English language and
       his preparations for the ETS test, and,  while  confirming  that  the
       voice on the recording provided to him was not his own, a denial that
       he used a proxy tester.

    8. Under the heading 'Findings', the  judge  set  out  paragraph  30  of
       Secretary of State for the Home Department v Shehzad  &  Anor  [2016]
       EWCA Civ  615  in  which  the  Court  of  Appeal  observed  that,  in
       circumstances where the generic ETS evidence was not  accompanied  by
       evidence showing that the individual under consideration's  test  was
       categorised  as  "invalid",  the  Secretary  of  State   would   face
       difficulties in respect of  the  evidential  burden  at  the  initial
       stage. At [51] the judge followed the  analysis  in  Shehzad,  noting
       again that the ETS test results were 'questionable' and not  invalid.
       The judge then considered further  observations  from  the  Court  of
       Appeal decision in Ahsan [2017] EWCA Civ 2009, relating to challenges
       to the SSHD's approach in ETS cases, and took into  account  a  joint
       expert  report  prepared  for  the  case  of   MM   &   MA   v   SSHD
       (IA/39899/2014), which was reported as MA v SSHD (ETS -TOEIC testing)
       [2016] UKUT 450 (IAC) and conjoined for hearing with two other  cases
       (R (on the application of Mohibullah) v Secretary of  State  for  the
       Home Department (TOEIC - ETS -  judicial  review  principles)  [2016]
       UKUT 00561 (IAC), and R (on the application of Saha  and  Another)  v
       Secretary of State for the Home Department (Secretary of State's duty
       of candour) [2017] UKUT 00017(IAC)). The joint  expert  report  noted
       that remote access software was sometimes used  in  test  centers  to
       alter results without the test taker knowing, that there was a  delay
       in uploading the data and audio files which  allowed  for  fraudulent
       replacement, and that there was no meta data linking test  takers  to
       audio files. In light of this evidence, the judge concluded that  the
       SSHD failed to discharge the evidential burden  of  showing  a  prima
       facie case of fraud. In reaching this conclusion the judge relied  on
       the 'questionable' test result as opposed to an 'invalid' result, the
       observations in Shehzad, the dicta in Ahsan, the joint expert report,
       and the absence of meta date  linking  the  voice  recording  to  the
       claimant.

    9. The judge nevertheless considered, in the alternative, that  even  if
       the initial evidential  burden  has  been  discharged,  the  claimant
       provided an innocent explanation and that he was the innocent  victim
       of fraud. At [57] and [58]  the  judge  holistically  considered  the
       findings of the joint expert report, the claimant's high  proficiency
       in English, his studies of English in Bangladesh and his preparations
       before taking the ETS test, the evidence from the claimant's wife  (a
       native English speaker), whom  the  judge  found  to  be  honest  and
       reliable, and the claimant's evidence concerning the circumstances of
       the test and the amount he paid for it.

   10. The judge proceeded to determine the human rights claim in  light  of
       his factual findings. The judge went through the Razgar  [2004]  UKHL
       27 questions, finding that Art  8  was  engaged  in  respect  of  the
       applicant's  relationship  with  his  partner,  that  there  was   an
       interference of sufficient severity to trigger the operation  of  Art
       8, and that the respondent's decision was both lawful and in  pursuit
       of  a  legitimate  aim.  In  assessing  proportionality,  the   judge
       identified the public interest factors  set  out  in  s.117B  of  the
       Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002,  and  noted  that  the
       claimant met all the requirements of the immigration rules  necessary
       for a  grant  of  leave  to  remain  under  Appendix  FM.  The  judge
       considered this a  weighty  factor  when  determining  the  issue  of
       proportionality and concluded, having regard to the  public  interest
       factors and his own findings, that the refusal of  the  human  rights
       claim was disproportionate. The appeal was allowed.

The grounds of appeal, the grant  of  permission  and  the  'error  of  law'
hearing

   11. The Grounds of Appeal contend that the judge erred  in  finding  that
       the claimant's test results were 'questionable' when they  were  "...
       in fact invalid."  The grounds rely on the supposed  'invalidity'  of
       the claimant's ETS test results to support the SSHD's contention that
       the judge failed to properly assess the burden of proof in accordance
       with SM and Qadir and the conclusions  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  in
       Shehzad.

   12. The Grounds additionally criticise the judge for failing to  consider
       whether there may be other reasons why, if the claimant  could  speak
       English to the required level, he would nevertheless cause or  permit
       a proxy tester to take an ETS test on his behalf, citing the decision
       in MA.

   13. The grounds  finally  contend  that  the  judge  failed  to  identify
       sufficiently compelling circumstances to justify allowing the  appeal
       on Art 8 grounds. The proportionality assessment was coloured by  the
       judge's error in respect of his findings on  the  use  of  deception.
       There were said to be no reasons given as  to  why  the  family  life
       could not continue in Bangladesh, and there  was  nothing  preventing
       the  claimant  from  making  an  entry  clearance  application   from
       Bangladesh.

   14. Permission was refused by the First-tier Tribunal, but granted  after
       a renewal directly to the Upper  Tribunal.  Although  the  claimant's
       name and appeal number appear at the top  of  the  decision  granting
       permission, the claimant is later referred to as 'AG', and  reference
       is made to "evidence from Brac Bank".  There  was  no  evidence  from
       "Brac Bank".  It  is  unclear  why  this  appears  in  the  grant  of
       permission.

   15. At the outset of the 'error of law' hearing Mr  Tufan  accepted  that
       the ETS SELT SOURCE DATA document relating to the claimant was marked
       as 'questionable'. He was unable to explain why the grounds  asserted
       to the contrary. He nevertheless submitted that the fact that the ETS
       tests results were not 'invalid' did not exclude the possibility that
       the claimant knowingly used a proxy tester, and that the judge should
       have considered other reasons why a  competent  English  speaker  may
       still wish to use a proxy tester. Mr Tufan confirmed  that  no  issue
       had been raised by the SSHD in respect of the  claimant's  compliance
       with all the Eligibility requirements under  Appendix  FM,  including
       that related to the financial and immigration status requirements.

   16. We indicated that we did not need to hear from Ms Christie  and  that
       we were minded to dismiss  the  SSHD's  appeal,  but  that  we  would
       reserve our decision. We heard submissions from both  representatives
       in respect of an application  by  the  claimant  for  a  costs  order
       against the SSHD and reserved our decision on this application.

Discussion

   17. We are at a loss to understand how  the  author  of  the  Grounds  of
       Appeal could assert  that  the  judge  inaccurately  categorised  the
       claimant's ETS test as 'questionable' rather than 'invalid'. The  ETS
       test result is incontrovertibly clear. There is no  basis  whatsoever
       for asserting that the claimant's English language test was found  to
       be 'invalid.' This factual inaccuracy  fundamentally  undermines  the
       principle criticism levelled  by  the  SSHD  against  the  First-tier
       Tribunal  judge.  The  judge  was  fully  entitled  to  rely  on  the
       distinction between a 'questionable' and an  'invalid'  test  result,
       considered in light of the observations of the Court in  Shehzad,  in
       concluding that the SSHD had not discharged  the  initial  evidential
       burden. In so doing the judge  additionally  took  into  account  the
       findings of the joint expert's report detailed in  MA  (ETS  -  TOEIC
       testing) [2016] UKUT 450 (IAC). We can discern no legal error in  the
       judge's reasoning from [49] to  [56].  The  judge  properly  directed
       himself in respect of the correct legal test and applied that test to
       the evidence before him.

   18. Having found that the judge was entitled to conclude that the initial
       evidential burden had not been discharged, we do not need to consider
       his  alternative  finding  that  the  claimant  offered  a  plausible
       explanation and that he took the test himself.  We  are  nevertheless
       satisfied that the judge did give adequate reasons for  finding  that
       the claimant provided a plausible innocent  explanation.  The  SSHD's
       complaint centres  on  the  weight  attached  by  the  judge  to  the
       applicant's proficiency in English and the failure to  give  adequate
       reasons "... for holding that a person  who  clearly  speaks  English
       would therefore have no  reason  to  secure  a  test  certificate  by
       deception."

   19. The SSHD relies on an extract from MA. At [57] the Tribunal stated,

           Second, we acknowledge the suggestion that the Appellant had  no
           reason to engage in the deception which we  have  found  proven.
           However, this has not deflected us in any way from reaching  our
           main findings and conclusions. In the abstract, of course, there
           is a range of reasons why  persons  proficient  in  English  may
           engage in TOEIC fraud. These include,  inexhaustively,  lack  of
           confidence, fear of failure, lack of  time  and  commitment  and
           contempt  for  the  immigration  system.  These  reasons   could
           conceivably overlap in individual cases and there is  scope  for
           other explanations for deceitful conduct in this sphere. We  are
           not required to make the further finding of  why  the  Appellant
           engaged in deception and to this we add that this issue was  not
           explored  during  the  hearing.  We  resist  any  temptation  to
           speculate about this discrete matter.

   20. This extract must be considered in its proper context.  The  Tribunal
       had already concluded that the Appellant had  engaged  in  deception.
       The  Tribunal  found  there  were  "significant  gaps"  and  "notable
       discrepancies" in the Appellant's evidence, and that his account  was
       "vague and hesitant".  MA is not authority for the proposition that a
       judge, having found that an Appellant was,  at  all  material  times,
       sufficiently proficient in English, is then obliged to  speculate  as
       to why that person may nevertheless have had a reason to use a  proxy
       test-taker. In any event, at  [57]  and  [58]  the  judge  identified
       several reasons  in  support  of  his  conclusion  that  a  plausible
       innocent  explanation  had  been  provided,  in   addition   to   the
       applicant's proficiency in English. This included the findings of the
       joint expert report in MA highlighting concerns with the accuracy  of
       the  ETS  test-checking  process,  the  judge's  acceptance  of   the
       claimant's evidence regarding his preparation for the ETS  test,  his
       account of the fees he paid  for  the  test,  and  the  corroborative
       evidence of his partner, whom the judge found "honest and  reliable."
       The judge approached the claimant's explanation on a  holistic  basis
       and gave cogent and legally sustainable reasons for his conclusion.

   21. We finally consider  the  SSHD's  challenge  to  the  judge's  Art  8
       assessment. We agree with the claimant's rule 24  response  that  the
       SSHD's complaint is hopeless. Having found  that  the  allegation  of
       fraud had not been made out, and that the claimant had not  infringed
       the Suitability requirements, and there being  no  dispute  that  the
       claimant met all the other requirements of the immigration rules  for
       leave to remain as a spouse, the  judge  was  unarguably  correct  in
       concluding that the proportionality assessment fell in the claimant's
       favour. If any support is necessary for this conclusion, we  rely  on
       TZ (Pakistan) and PG (India) v The Secretary of State  for  the  Home
       Department [2018] EWCA Civ 1109, at [34]. The Court of  Appeal  held,
       in the context of applications for leave to remain by persons already
       in the UK, that, where a  person  satisfies  the  immigration  rules,
       whether or not by reference to an Art 8  informed  requirement,  this
       will be positively determinative  of  that  person's  Art  8  appeal,
       provided their case engages Art 8(1), for the  very  reason  that  it
       would be disproportionate for that person to be removed.



Notice of Decision

the First-tier Tribunal's decision did not involve the making  of  an  error
on a point of law.

The SSHD's appeal is dismissed.

Signed                                  Date

Upper Tribunal Judge Blum


    DECSION ON APPLICATION FOR A COSTS/EXPENSES ORDER UNDER RULE 10(3)(d)

    1. In his rule 24 Response, and at the 'error  of  law'  hearing  on  12
       October 2018, the claimant made an application for an award of  costs
       under rule 10 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)  Rules  2008
       against the SSHD.

    2. The claimant contends that the SSHD acted unreasonably in challenging
       the First-tier Tribunal's decision on the  basis  that  the  Tribunal
       misinterpreted the ETS look-up tool result  as  being  'questionable'
       rather than 'invalid'.  The claimant contends, inter  alia,  that  it
       would have been clear to any reasonably competent civil servant  that
       the ETS test result was 'questionable' and not 'invalid', and that it
       was not until the morning of the 'error  of  law'  hearing  that  the
       SSHD's representative accepted that the appeal proceeded on the wrong
       premise. The claimant  further  submits  that  the  duty  of  candour
       required the SSHD to bring to  the  Upper  Tribunal's  attention  the
       inaccurate references in the grant of permission to matters unrelated
       to the appeal (such as the  reference  to  'Brac  Bank'),  and  that,
       despite being aware of extensive expert evidence  about  the  limited
       nature of the SSHD's evidence  and  his  inability  to  link  English
       language tests to individuals,  the  SSHD  failed  to  disclose  this
       evidence in the claimant's case.

    3. Mr Tufan did not request an adjournment to enable him  to  deal  with
       the costs application and did not request any more time to respond to
       the application for wasted costs. He submitted that the claimant knew
       what the case against him was, and that a 'questionable'  result  did
       not mean that the claimant would inevitably  have  succeeded  in  his
       appeal.

    4. In assessing whether the SSHD acted unreasonably in  challenging  the
       First-tier Tribunal decision in the proceedings in the Upper Tribunal
       we have considered the decisions of Ridehalgh v Horsefield [1994]  Ch
       205, Cancino (costs - First-tier Tribunal - new powers) [2015]  UKFTT
       00059 (IAC), and Thapa & Ors (costs: general principles; s 9  review)
       [2018] UKUT 00054 (IAC). We  have  additionally  had  regard  to  the
       Presidential  Guidance  Note  No  2  of  2018  on  wasted  costs  and
       unreasonable costs. we note that the basic test is whether there is a
       reasonable explanation for the conduct under scrutiny.

    5. We further note that the award of costs is always discretionary, even
       in cases where the qualifying conditions are satisfied,  that  orders
       for costs will be very much the exception rather than  the  rule  and
       will be reserved to the clearest cases, and that any application  for
       wasted costs will be governed  in  the  main  by  the  principles  of
       fairness, expedition and proportionality.

    6. Our reasons for granting the application are as follows. The  conduct
       that is under  consideration  is  the  respondent's  application  for
       permission to appeal, and his pursuit of  the  appeal  to  the  Upper
       Tribunal hearing, on the basis that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  judge
       arguably erred in law in finding that the SSHD had not discharged the
       initial evidential burden in an ETS case.  The  first  and  principle
       ground was entirely premised on  the  First-tier  Tribunal's  alleged
       misinterpretation of the ETS evidence. The ground contends  that  the
       judge erred in finding ETS's assessment to be 'questionable' when  it
       was in fact 'invalid'. We are satisfied beyond  doubt  that  the  ETS
       assessment  concluded  that   the   applicant's   test   result   was
       'questionable' and not 'invalid'. A very specific  factual  assertion
       was made in the grounds that was wholly inconsistent with the  actual
       documentation that we consider must have been before  the  author  of
       the grounds when they were settled. It is almost  inconceivable  that
       grounds asserting a factual  mistake  by  a  judge  could  have  been
       settled without consideration of the ETS test Result at  Annex  A  of
       the supplementary bundle of documents. We  do  not  consider  that  a
       hypothetical reasonably competent  civil  servant  would  could  have
       settled and relied on a principle ground of appeal  that  contains  a
       fundamental and obvious factual error. Mr Tufan was unable  to  offer
       any reasonable explanation for this  fundamental  misapprehension  of
       the evidence.

    7. The remaining grounds only came into play if there  was  an  arguable
       error in respect of the judge's assessment as  to  whether  the  SSHD
       discharged the initial evidential burden. For the  reasons  given  by
       the judge, and in light of his accurate assertion that the  ETS  test
       result was not 'invalid', his  conclusion  was  unassailable  in  the
       context of the principle challenge mounted in the grounds.

    8. The SSHD's inaccurate and, we find, unreasonable conduct  in  respect
       of the ETS test result directly caused  the  claimant  to  incur  the
       costs of having to pay counsel to draft  issue  a  detailed  rule  24
       notice and to appear at the 'error of law' heating. We find there  is
       a direct causal link between the unreasonable conduct and  the  costs
       incurred.

                                  DECISION

    9. The application for an unreasonable costs order is duly granted.

   10. We do not consider it appropriate to award  the  claimant  the  legal
       fees for the adjournment  request  (ï¿½300),  or  counsel's  costs  for
       drafting the adjournment request (ï¿½900). The adjournment request  was
       not granted and was without merit given the  ability  of  alternative
       counsel  to  represent  the  claimant.  We  do  however  consider  it
       appropriate to summarily award the claimant the  costs  of  preparing
       the appeal hearing  and  counsel's  fees  for  preparing  the  appeal
       hearing, including the drafting of  the  detailed  rule  24  response
       (amounting to ï¿½2,250). The SSHD will pay the claimant's wasted  costs
       in the sum of ï¿½2,250.
