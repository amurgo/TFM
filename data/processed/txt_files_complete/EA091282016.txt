For the Respondent:    In person


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. I shall refer to the appellant as the respondent and the respondent  as
    the appellant (as they  appeared  respectively  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal).  The  appellant,  Monika  Natalia  Baran,  was  born  on  19
    February 1987 and is a female citizen of  Poland.   The  appellant  had
    been working  in  the  United  Kingdom  since  2005  and  she  made  an
    application for a permanent residence card under the Immigration  (EEA)
    Regulations 2006.  That application was refused by a  decision  of  the
    respondent dated 18 July 2016.  The appellant appealed  to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal (Judge Housego) which, in a decision  promulgated  on  27
    September 2016,  allowed  the  appeal.   The  Secretary  of  State  now
    appeals, with permission, to the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The right to recognition of permanent residence in the  United  Kingdom
    is given under Regulation 15 of the 2016 Regulations:

         Right of permanent residence

         15.-(1) The following persons acquire the right to  reside  in  the
         United Kingdom permanently-

         (a)an EEA national  who  has  resided  in  the  United  Kingdom  in
         accordance with these Regulations for a continuous period  of  five
         years;

         (b)a family member of an EEA national who is not  an  EEA  national
         but who has resided in the United Kingdom with the EEA national  in
         accordance with these Regulations for a continuous period  of  five
         years;

         (c)a worker or self-employed person who has ceased activity;

         (d)the family member of a worker or self-employed  person  who  has
         ceased activity, provided-

         (i)the person was the family member of the worker or  self-employed
         person at the point  the  worker  or  self-employed  person  ceased
         activity; and

         (ii)at that point, the family member enjoyed a right to  reside  on
         the basis of being the  family  member  of  that  worker  or  self-
         employed person;

         (e)a person who was the family member of a worker or  self-employed
         person where-

         (i)the worker or self-employed person has died;

         (ii)the family member resided  with  the  worker  or  self-employed
         person immediately before the death; and

         (iii)the worker or self-employed person had resided continuously in
         the United Kingdom for at least two years immediately before  dying
         or the  death  was  the  result  of  an  accident  at  work  or  an
         occupational disease;

         (f)a person who-

         (i)has resided in the  United  Kingdom  in  accordance  with  these
         Regulations for a continuous period of five years; and

         (ii)was, at the end of the period, a family member who has retained
         the right of residence.

         (2) Residence in the United Kingdom as a  result  of  a  derivative
         right to reside does not constitute residence for  the  purpose  of
         this regulation.

         (3) The right of permanent residence under this regulation is  lost
         through absence from the United Kingdom for a period exceeding  two
         years.

         (4) A person who satisfies the criteria in this regulation  is  not
         entitled to a right to permanent residence in  the  United  Kingdom
         where the Secretary of State or an immigration officer has  made  a
         decision under regulation 23(6)(b), 24(1), 25(1), 26(3)  or  31(1),
         unless that decision is  set  aside  or  otherwise  no  longer  has
         effect.




 3. The respondent's refusal  letter  makes  reference  to  the  forms  P60
    submitted  by  the  appellant  in  support  of  her  application.   The
    appellant had worked for a number of  different  companies  during  the
    period of her residence and explained to me that one of  the  companies
    had undergone a transfer of undertaking to a  different  company.   The
    refusal letter makes reference to the European Modern  Guidance  which,
    it is  stated,  should  be  considered  when  determining  whether  the
    appellant's residence and exercise of Treaty Rights  was  "genuine  and
    effective".  Because of the low figures shown on  the  appellant's  P60
    forms, the respondent took the view  that  the  appellant's  employment
    could only be considered "genuine and effective" from the start of  the
    2014 financial year (described as '1 April 2013' - which  would  appear
    to be an error since the tax year begins on 6 April).  In  consequence,
    the respondent took the view that the  appellant  had  not  established
    that she had exercised Treaty Rights in the United Kingdom for a period
    of five years prior to the date of her application which  was  made  in
    March 2016.

 4. Judge Housego was at something of a  disadvantage  given  that  he  was
    dealing with this appeal on  the  papers.   He  appears  to  have  been
    concerned with the fact that the appellant had given birth to  a  child
    in May 2005.  The appellant, however,  had  sought  to  establish  five
    years of permanent residence in the period  immediately  preceding  her
    application in March 2016; I am not sure, therefore,  why  the  child's
    birth date should have been a relevance.  The appellant  told  me  that
    she had sought to establish that she had been working or  at  the  same
    time also a student from  March  2011  to  March  2016.   Her  evidence
    indicated that she had been in part-time work up  until  November  2012
    and had since that time been in full-time employment.   Mrs  Pettersen,
    for the Secretary of State, acknowledged that the evidence would appear
    to show that the appellant had been living in  the  United  Kingdom  in
    accordance with the Regulations  and  exercising  Treaty  Rights  as  a
    worker/jobseeker/student throughout the five year period prior  to  the
    date of her application.  I am  grateful  to  Mrs  Pettersen  for  that
    indication because it coincides  with  my  own  interpretation  of  the
    evidence which was before Judge Housego.  The appellant did not need to
    show (as Judge Housego appears to have believed - see  [14])  that  she
    had worked prior to the birth of her daughter and then for three  years
    after the birth.  Leaving aside the "Guidelines" which are referred  to
    in  the  refusal  letter,  the  evidence  plainly  indicates  that  the
    appellant had been living in the United Kingdom in accordance with  the
    Regulations for the period of five years  prior  to  the  date  of  her
    application.  I am satisfied that Judge Housego may have erred  in  law
    at [14] in his assessment of the evidence but, given that the appellant
    should in any event have  succeeded  in  her  appeal,  I  refrain  from
    setting aside his decision which shall stand accordingly.
