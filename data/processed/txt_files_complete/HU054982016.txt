Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr E Ikwuazom, a solicitor
For the Respondent:    Mr Walker, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. The appellant was born on 7th July,  1984  and  is  a  national  of
         Nigeria.  She appeals against the decision of the respondent, taken
         on 5th February 2016, to refuse to grant her, her husband  and  her
         three sons further leave to remain in the  United  Kingdom  on  the
         basis that the appellant had a qualifying child over the age of  7,
         pursuant to Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules and Article  8  of
         the European Convention on Human Rights.


      2. The appellant entered the United Kingdom on 22nd August 2007,  with
         a visit visa.  On 7th July 2012, she applied for  leave  to  remain
         outside the Immigration Rules which  was  refused  on  13th  August
         2013, with no right of appeal.  She made  further  application  for
         leave to remain on the basis of her family and private life in  the
         United Kingdom.


      3. The appellant's appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Chana
         at Hatton Cross on 17th  August  2017.   At  paragraph  25  of  the
         judge's decision she said this:-

             "I accept that one of the appellant's sons has lived  in  this
             country for over seven years.  He  is  now  eight  years  old.
             However, the appellant must demonstrate that  there  would  be
             very significant obstacles in accordance with EX2 of  Appendix
             FM for the eight-year-old to go to Nigeria  with  his  parents
             and siblings, if required to leave the  United  Kingdom.   The
             appellant's children are not British and therefore do not meet
             the requirements of paragraph  EX1(a)  of  Appendix  FM.   The
             appellant also has to demonstrate that they (sic) [there] will
             be serious hardship for the appellant and  his  (sic)  husband
             and children to return to Nigeria."


         She went on to find that there were no  significant  obstacles  to
         the family's removal.

      4. The  appellant  appealed  citing  paragraph  276ADE(1)(iv)  of  the
         Immigration Rules and pointing out that the material  part  of  the
         two provisions set out in that Rule is in fact the same,  the  test
         being whether it would be reasonable to  expect  the  applicant  to
         leave the United Kingdom.


      5. The applicant spent some 32 years of her  life  in  Nigeria  before
         coming to the United Kingdom  and  both  she  and  her  spouse  are
         Nigerian nationals.  The third appellant was 8 years of age at  the
         time of the hearing before the judge on 14th  February  this  year.
         The judge records the fourth appellant as being nearly 5� years old
         and the fifth appellant as being  nearly  4  years  old.   All  the
         children were born in the United Kingdom.  In fact, the appellant's
         second child was at the time of the hearing almost 6� years old and
         is now I am told over 7 years of age.


      6. Before me Mr  Walker  accepted  that  the  decision  of  First-tier
         Tribunal Judge Chana did contain a  material  error  of  law.   The
         judge simply applied the wrong test.  Paragraph 276ADE(1)(iv) says:-



         "(iv)    is under the age of 18 years and has lived continuously in
             the UK for at least seven years  (discounting  any  period  of
             imprisonment) and it would not be  reasonable  to  expect  the
             applicant to leave the UK".

      7. At the hearing before me, Mr Ikwuazom told me that there  were  now
         two qualifying children, because the appellant's second  child  was
         now over the age of  7  years.   He  told  me  that  he  relied  on
         paragraph 95 of MA Pakistan.  He explained that in  that  case  the
         child had autism which resulted in him being identified as a  child
         with special educational needs.  In particular, he had  significant
         problems with language, social interaction  and  communication  and
         displayed stereotyped behaviour and mannerisms.  Very active  steps
         had been taken to deal with his problems  through  regular  therapy
         and specialist teaching.  In this appeal, however, the  appellant's
         second qualifying child has a deformity of the hand  and  this,  he
         told me, had required specialist surgery in the United Kingdom.  He
         confirmed that there  was  no  evidence  that  treatment  for  this
         condition was not available in Nigeria.  The issue he suggested was
         whether it was reasonable to expect these two children to leave the
         United Kingdom.  He submitted that in all the circumstances it  was
         not reasonable.  It was not reasonable because the second child had
         a rare condition which had required surgery and the first child, in
         any event, will next year be entitled, as a  right,  to  apply  for
         British  citizenship.   He  submitted  that  now  the  parties  had
         conjoined family claims.  He accepted  that  since  Mr  Walker  had
         accepted that there was an error of law, I  could  now  remake  the
         decision myself.  He invited me to allow the appellant's appeal.

      8. For the Secretary of State, Mr Walker accepted that the  judge  had
         applied the wrong test, but pointed out that at paragraph 31 of the
         decision, the First-tier Tribunal Judge had referred  to  the  fact
         that the appellant has not demonstrated that medical facilities are
         not  available  in  Nigeria  to  meet  the  medical  needs  of  the
         appellant's child who was due then to have  reconstruction  on  his
         hand because of his extra thumb.  The child has  already  undergone
         some operations in the United Kingdom. The issue for the judge  was
         to decide whether or not it would be reasonable to expect the child
         the leave the United Kingdom.  The judge should have identified the
         public interest  engaged,  measured  its  strength  and  determined
         whether the private and family life factors advanced on  behalf  of
         the respondent outweighed the public interest to  the  extent  that
         the decision was disproportionate Mr Walker pointed out that  there
         was no evidence today to suggest that any treatment the appellant's
         children may require is  not  available  to  them  in  Nigeria.   I
         reserved my decision.

      9. At paragraphs 22 onwards in her determination, the judge makes  her
         findings of fact.  The appellant  and  her  husband  had  lived  in
         Nigeria until their 30s.  At the time of the hearing  only  one  of
         the appellant's children was a qualifying child.  Now there are two
         children who qualify.  The evidence before the judge was  that  the
         appellant's oldest child was doing very  well  and  had  made  good
         academic progress at school.   No  objective  evidence  was  placed
         before her that Nigeria did not have a functioning education system
         where the appellant's 8 year old son and other  children  would  be
         able to enter and continue to do well in their studies in  Nigeria.
         She accepted that  returning  to  Nigeria  as  a  family  unit  and
         continuing life may involve a degree of disruption to their  lives,
         but  she  did  not  believe  that  that  was  unreasonable  in  the
         circumstances of the family.

     10. I have read the appellant's bundles.  I was asked to consider  page
         A8 of the appellants' bundle, but so  that  there  is  no  doubt  I
         confirm that I have also read pages A6 and page A9.   I  have  read
         the medical evidence at pages C1 to C27.   The  decision  does  not
         give the dates of birth of the children, but these are set  out  in
         the letter of 28th October 2005, addressed to the Home Office  with
         the appellant's application  for  leave.   The  appellant's  oldest
         child was born on 30th May, 2008.  The appellant's second child was
         born on 27th September 2010.  There is a third child who  was  born
         on 9th May 2012.


     11. It is clear from the school reports that  all  three  children  are
         making good progress at  their  schools.   The  appellant's  oldest
         child is described as being a bright, well-mannered and hardworking
         boy who shows a very positive attitude to  his  learning  since  he
         joined the school.   Academically  he  is  particularly  strong  in
         mathematics.  His younger brother is described  as  being  "lovely,
         very able, bright child who applies himself to his learning at  all
         times.  He is very popular and is well-liked by his peers.   He  is
         particularly more able in mathematics and enjoys learning it".  The
         youngest child is described as being "friendly, inquisitive and  an
         adorable child who enjoys  learning  new  things  about  the  world
         around him".

     12. The longer a child has resided in the United Kingdom the  more  the
         balance will begin to swing in terms of it  being  unreasonable  to
         expect the child to leave the United Kingdom.  It was necessary for
         the judge to consider whether, considering all the evidence in  the
         round, it would be unreasonable to expect  the  appellant's  oldest
         child to leave the United Kingdom with his parents.  In  fact,  the
         appellant's second son is now 7 years of age., however, looking  at
         all the evidence in the round, I have concluded that it  would  not
         be unreasonable to expect either of  the  appellant's  children  to
         leave the United Kingdom.  They will not be at any disadvantage  in
         Nigeria where they will be brought  up  learning  about  their  own
         heritage in their own culture, have access  to  education  services
         and to any further health services that they may require.


     13. While, for the reason set out above, I accept that the  First  Tier
         Tribunal Judge made an error of law, it was not  a  material  error
         and her decision shall stand.
