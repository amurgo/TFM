Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Bramble (Home Office Presenting Officer)
For the Respondent:    Represented by the Sponsor, Mr Tebo

                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. The respondent in these proceedings was  the  appellant  before  the
       First-tier Tribunal. From hereon I have referred to the  parties  as
       they were in the First-tier Tribunal so that for  example  reference
       to the respondent is a reference to the Secretary of State  for  the
       Home Department.

    2. The Appellant is a citizen of Botswana.  On  December  1,  2014  the
       appellant applied for entry clearance to the  United  Kingdom  as  a
       spouse. The respondent refused his application on January 13, 2015.

    3. The appellant appealed that decision  under  section  82(1)  of  the
       Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 on February 2, 2015 and
       asked for the matter to be dealt with on the papers.

    4. The appeal came before  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Ennals
       (hereinafter referred to as the Judge) on December 11, 2015 and in a
       decision promulgated on December 21, 2015 he allowed the appellant's
       appeal under the Immigration Rules.

    5. The respondent  lodged  grounds  of  appeal  on  December  29,  2015
       submitting the Judge had erred in his assessment under  Appendix  FM
       by failing to have regard to the provisions of Appendix FM-SE of the
       Immigration Rules and in particular the provisions relating  to  the
       requirement to submit payslips  and  corresponding  bank  statements
       over a twelve-month period in light of the fact  the  appellant  had
       only commenced work  in  September  2014  and  his  application  was
       submitted three months later.

    6. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal
       Parkes on May 28,  2016  who  found  it  was  arguable  the  Judge's
       approach was flawed.

    7. The matter came before me on the above date and I heard  submissions
       from both Mr Bramble and the sponsor.

    8. No anonymity direction has been made.

SUBMISSIONS

    9. Mr Bramble relied on the grounds of appeal and referred  me  to  the
       provisions of  Appendix  FM-SE  of  the  Immigration  Rules  and  in
       particular sections A1(2) which makes clear that where an  appellant
       has not been in his current employment for six months then he has to
       provide:

        a. A letter from the employer confirming his employment  and  gross
           annual salary.
        b. The length of the employment.
        c. The period over which the salary has been paid.
        d. The type of employment.
        e. Personal bank statements corresponding to the same period as the
           payslips showing the salary had been paid into the account.

   10. Mr Bramble submitted the income from Care Direct Recruitment (one of
       the appellant's employers) did not appear in the bank statements and
       the income adduced did not satisfy the minimum income  threshold  of
       �18,600.

   11. The sponsor indicated he had sent all his papers to the Tribunal and
       asked that the case be dealt with on the papers. He  confirmed  that
       he had finished work in December  2013  and  had  gone  to  Botswana
       returning around September 2014 when he commenced work. He  believed
       he had provided the necessary papers.

DISCUSSION AND FINDINGS

   12. In giving permission to appeal the Judge noted  that  post  decision
       evidence may have been submitted and  it  was  unclear  whether  the
       Judge had had regard to the  Immigration  Rules  and  in  particular
       Appendix FM-SE. In  granting  permission  Judge  of  the  First-tier
       Tribunal Parkes noted there was no challenge to the Judge's  finding
       that the marriage was genuine.

   13. The Judge was dealing with an entry clearance application  and  such
       applications are governed by Appendix FM and Appendix FM-SE  of  the
       Immigration Rules. The Judge must only consider  evidence  submitted
       with the application subject to the exception set out in Appendix FM-
       SE (D)(b) or (e).


   14. In this case the appellant provided a letter  of  employment  and  a
       contract of employment dated  September  10  and  October  13,  2014
       respectively. The letter indicated a salary of �7,497 per annum  and
       the contract indicated a salary �15,026 per annum. It is  clear  the
       sponsor ceased working in the United Kingdom on  December  11,  2013
       and according to his submission today he indicated that  because  he
       wanted an extended holiday he was informed he would have to re-apply
       for his job back in his return.


   15. Although he produced payslips for 2013 all of  these  pre-dated  his
       application by more than twelve months save one which was his  final
       payslip in December 2013. He then produced two payslips prior to the
       date  of  application  and  two  that  post-dated  his  application.
       Appendix FM-SE (D) prevents these later wage-slips being introduced.
       In respect of his second employment he produced invoices  that  pre-
       dated his application and some that post-dated his application.


   16. The appellant's application form was  contained  in  the  bundle  in
       section E and attached to the form was the employment  letter  dated
       September 10, 2014 from Care  Direct,  offer  of  employment  letter
       dated September 12, 2014  from  Autism  Sussex,  two  payslips  from
       Autism Sussex and three payslips from Care Direct.  The  application
       was submitted  on  December  1,  2014.  The  required  documents  as
       specified  in  Appendix  FM-SE  were  not   included   namely   bank
       statements.


   17.  The  bank  statements  and  evidence  of  their  relationship  were
       submitted with the grounds of appeal  and  this  evidence  could  be
       found in Section D of the bundle. The grounds of appeal submitted by
       the appellant make clear that specified evidence was  only  attached
       with the grounds of appeal but  this  was  not  evidence  the  Judge
       should have had regard to in light of Appendix FM-SE(D).


   18. If the sponsor is still in these two employments, then it  seems  to
       me that he is likely to now meet the Rules although ultimately  that
       is a matter for the respondent.


   19. The  Judge  had  to  consider  what  had  been  submitted  with  the
       application and by considering evidence after  the  application  had
       been lodged and the decision had been taken (see  statement  in  Fee
       Award) the Judge erred in law.


   20. I therefore set aside the decision allowing the  appeal  and  remake
       the decision by dismissing it under the Rules.

DECISION

   21. The making of the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve
       the making of an error on a point of law. I set aside the  decision.
       I remake the decision and I dismiss the appeal under the Immigration
       Rules.
