Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr N Smart, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    No Appearance


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    This appeal came before me following a grant of permission  to  appeal
      on 4 April 2014 against the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Pacey who, by a determination promulgated on 24 January 2014,  allowed
      the respondent's appeal brought before the First-tier Tribunal against
      the refusal to grant him entry to  the  United  Kingdom  as  a  family
      visitor.

2.    At the hearing, Mr Smart referred me to his fax previously sent on  23
      May 2014 in which he confirmed that  he  was  withdrawing  the  appeal
      against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Pacey.

3.    Rule  17  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
      provides for a party to withdraw its case before the  Upper  Tribunal,
      with the consent of the Tribunal. That consent is now given.

4.    The effect of the withdrawal is that the decision  of  the  First-tier
      Tribunal is unchallenged and shall stand.

DECISION

5.    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not  involve
      an error on a point of law. The decision to allow the appeal stands.
