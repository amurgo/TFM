Representation:

For the Respondent:    Mr Alexander (Counsel)


     DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

1.   This is an appeal by the Secretary of  State.  I  shall  refer  to  the
    parties herein as the Secretary of State and the claimant. The claimant
    whose date of birth is 30 June 1991 is a citizen of  Sri  Lanka.   This
    matter comes before me for consideration as to whether or not there  is
    a material error of law in the decision  made  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Raymond promulgated on 11 April 2014.

Background

2.   The claimant applied for entry clearance as  the  spouse  of  a  person
    present and settled in the UK.  Her first application was refused on 10
    October 2012. She reapplied on 3 November 2012.  This was refused on  1
    February 2013 and the refusal upheld in a review by the Entry Clearance
    Manager on 18 September 2013.

3.   The reasons for refusal were that the claimant failed  to  provide  the
    specified documents to show that her spouse was a self-employed  person
    who could meet the financial threshold of �18,600 pursuant to paragraph
    7 Appendix FM-SE in the form of:

    (1)  SA300/SA302 for one year;


    (2)  the same for the previous financial years, if  the  latest  return
         does not show the necessary gross income but  the  average  of  the
         last two financial years does;


    (3)  twelve months of  bank  statements  concomitantly  supporting  tax
         return income;


    (4)  evidence of ongoing employment through national insurance class  2
         contributions; or


    (5)  specified documents supporting savings.


    No issue  was  raised  as  to  the  genuine  and  subsisting  marriage,
    accommodation or the citizenship of the spouse.

4.   The  Entry  Clearance  Manager  considered  the  evidence  of  an  HMRC
    document and took the view that it related only to how much the sponsor
    was required to pay based on self-assessment.  He failed to provide the
    self-assessment form SA300/SA302 which showed how  his  self-employment
    was assessed and the figure for income from his work.  The claimant did
    not provide personal bank statements and failed  to  show  income  paid
    into his personal bank account.  There was evidence  of  payments  made
    from a business bank account.  There  was  no  evidence  from  HMRC  to
    confirm national insurance class 2 contributions were paid.

5.   The First tier Tribunal determination  fully  and  comprehensively  set
    out the law, evidence, discussion  and  findings.  The  Tribunal  Judge
    allowed the appeal  on  the  basis  that  discretion  could  have  been
    otherwise exercised by the Secretary  of  State  seeking  clarification
    over the documentation of SA300/SA302, personal  bank  statements,  and
    evidence of class 2 national insurance, as against a background of very
    substantial and solid  evidence  showing  an  income  produced  by  the
    sponsor through his active business.  [22]


6.   The Tribunal found as follows:

         .    There was considerable evidence at the time of the application
             before the ECO that the sponsor had a personal income from his
             VAT registered newsagent's business,  from  which  he  had  an
             income on which he was paying tax.  It was not  accepted  that
             the documentation, without a tax return was sufficient, so far
             as specified documents were concerned, so as to establish that
             his income was generating over �18,600.  [19]


         .    Although the SA302  to  April  2012,  meaning  the  accounting
             period to April 2011 in fact, had it been provided only showed
             profits of �15,107, falling short of the �18,600 threshold  by
             �3,493, it was also above �13,400.  [20]


         .    The sponsor  did  neglect  to  submit  personal  bank  account
             statements.  He   submitted business bank account  statements,
             which on their face had the effect  of  reinforcing  the  very
             substantial evidence which could not leave in doubt that there
             was an active business generating income that was clearly also
             going into other accounts, and it would have been  appropriate
             to allow the sponsor to produce personal bank statements  with
             information detailing how it and his business account, he  was
             receiving his income.  [21]


         .     Not  least  because  the  July  2012  SA300  itself,  however
             inadequate in isolation, clearly showed that the  sponsor  was
             being taxed on such income, a similar  discretion  could  have
             been exercised over the omission of class 2 NI  evidence,  and
             an appropriate request would have been productive as something
             akin to the December 2013 letter in this regard at an  earlier
             stage.


7.   The First-tier Judge set out the Rules at FM-FE paragraph  (d)(iii)  "a
    document that does not contain all of the  specified  information,  but
    the missing information is verifiable from one other document submitted
    with the application ... the application may be  granted  exceptionally
    providing the decision-maker is satisfied that the document is  genuine
    and that the applicant meets the  requirement  to  which  the  document
    relates ...

     (f)Before making a decision under Appendix FM  or  this  Appendix,  the
    decision-maker may contact the applicant and  their  representative  in
    writing or otherwise to request further information or documents.   The
    material requested must be received at the  address  specified  in  the
    request with a reasonable timescale specified in the request."

Grounds of Appeal

8.   The Tribunal at [21] disregarded its findings on the type  of  evidence
    required, the format, and the periods to be covered under Appendix  FM-
    SE. The Tribunal was selective in its active application of  the  Rules
    and must give full consideration to their actual wording.

9.     Further the Tribunal had no regard to the relevant date as  the  date
    of application and the  significant  evidence  is  from  the  specified
    period before that date.  The Tribunal disregarded  the  fact  that  no
    personal bank statements were provided as required by the Rules.

10.  Accordingly it was unclear  as  to  what  the  sponsor's  gross  annual
    income was at the date of application.  If the sponsor's current income
    exceeded the income threshold a fresh application can be made with  the
    specified evidence required.

Permission to Appeal

11.  Permission was granted on 28 May  2014  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Ransley for reasons set out in paragraph 4:

         "The judge [at 6] set  out  the  specified  evidence  for  a  self-
         employed person at paragraph 7 of Appendix FM.  The judge found [at
         19-22] that the appellant  had  failed  to  provide  the  specified
         evidence: the sponsor's tax returns, personal bank  statements  and
         class 2 national insurance.  Furthermore the judge found  that  the
         sponsor's SA302 to April 2012 (for  the  accounting  period  ending
         April 2011), had it been provided by the appellant, would only have
         shown profits of �15,107, falling short of  the  �18,600  threshold
         under the Immigration Rules.  In this light, the  judge's  decision
         to allow the appeal on the basis that the  respondent's  discretion
         could  have  been  otherwise  exercised  in  seeking  the   missing
         specified evidence from the appellant involves an arguable error of
         law that might have made a material difference to  the  outcome  of
         the appeal.  Permission to appeal granted on all grounds".

Error of Law Hearing

12.  For the hearing before me on 15 July  2014  the  claimant's  solicitors
    produced a bundle of documents amounting to 84  pages  in  addition  to
    which I had the appeal bundle. Mr Alexander confirmed that he  did  not
    have and had never had a copy of the Secretary of  State's  bundle.   I
    provided him with a copy of the  same  and  gave  him  the  opportunity
    during the hearing to look at the bundle.

Submissions

13.  At the start of  the  hearing  Mr  Walker  indicated  that  he  and  Mr
    Alexander had had a preliminary  discussion  and  reached  a  tentative
    agreement that as at the date of decision there was evidence of �22,133
    profit from the sponsor's business.

14.  There was further  discussion  as  to  what  evidence  was  before  the
    Tribunal to establish that the rules  were  met  at  the  date  of  the
    application and /or the date of decision  ,  and  whether  or  not  the
    evidence covered the financial year, the tax  year  or  the  accounting
    period.

15.    Mr Walker relied on the grounds of appeal. He  sought leave to  amend
     the grounds (which I granted) that the Judge  erred  by  allowing  the
    appeal outright and failing to refer the matter  to  the  Secretary  of
    State for  further  consideration.  He  submitted  that  there  was  no
    evidence of specified documents to establish the sponsor's  income  for
    the relevant period  of  time,  no  personal  bank  statements  and  no
    evidence of national insurance contributions. It remained open  to  the
    claimant to make a fresh application  based  on  the  evidence  showing
    �22,000 profit.

16.  Mr Alexander submitted that all the  specified  documents  were  before
    the Entry Clearance manager who failed to properly consider  the  same.
    In the alternative he submitted that the Judge's decision  was  correct
    save that he should have remitted the matter to the Secretary of  State
    for reconsideration in light of the evidence available rather  than  to
    allow the appeal  outright.   He  submitted  that  the  error  was  not
    material given there was  evidence that the requirements were met.


Discussion and Decision

17.   I am satisfied that  the  Tribunal  Judge  correctly  found  that  the
    claimant failed to provide the specified documents with the application
    and failed to show an income meeting the  required  threshold  for  the
    relevant period of time in the required format.  The  findings  as  set
    out in paragraph 6 above  were sustainable on the evidence before  him.



18.  The error of law arises because the Tribunal Judge allowed  the  appeal
    outright on the grounds that discretion ought to have been exercised by
    the Secretary of State with reference to App FM-SE (d)(iii) or in other
    words the decision made was not in accordance with the law.  The  Judge
    took the view that had the Secretary of State exercised  discretion  by
    contacting the claimant to request further information or documents  in
    accordance with paragraph FM-SE, the claimant would have been  able  to
    establish an income of �22,000.  I find that this was not a  conclusion
    open to him on the evidence. It was not open to the Judge to find  that
    discretion should have been exercised and to allow the appeal outright.
    The outcome was certainly  not  inevitable  and  there  was  no  proper
    consideration as to how App FM FE (d)(iii)  applied.  Where  discretion
    ought to have been exercised the proper course was for the matter to be
    remitted to the Secretary of State.   Where  it  is  alleged  that  the
    discretion was or should have been exercised differently it would  have
    been open to the Judge to perform that  exercise.  Having  reached  the
    conclusion that the rules were not met  with  the  specified  documents
    there was no discretion, as the conditions in paragraph (d)(iii)  above
    were not met. I was not persuaded by Mr Alexander's submissions and  it
    was clear that the claimant had not submitted the specified documentary
    evidence.

19.  Although the Judge correctly found that personal  bank  statements  for
    NatWest account ending 0033 covering the period April 2011 to  November
    2013 [15] were produced, he nevertheless found statements for September
    2011 onwards were missing. Evidence of payment  of  national  insurance
    contributions appeared in a letter dated 18.12.13 and was not therefore
    available nor produced with the application. The SA302 for 2011/12  and
    SA302 for 2012/13 were produced with a letter dated  16.5.13.  Accounts
    produced for the period ending 30.4.2012 were not audited and were  not
    signed and  dated  by  the  accountants.   There  was  no  evidence  to
    establish the sponsor's income for the significant and relevant  period
    of time in the format required to meet the rules.

20.  There is a material error of law in  that  the  Judge  failed  to  make
    findings  that  established  that  the  application  came  within   the
    Secretary of State's discretion under FM- FE (d) (iii)  and  reached  a
    decision that was not open to him to make or sustainable on the facts.

21.  At the hearing  I  indicated  that  I  would  seek  the  views  of  the
    representatives as to the remaking of the decision  in  the  event   of
    finding an error of law. At that stage I considered that  remitting  to
    the Secretary of State was a possible outcome.   However  as  is  clear
    from my decision I find no basis for the exercise of  discretion.   The
    fact of the matter remains  that  there  was  no  tax  return  for  the
    relevant period and the  Judge  found  that  any  tax  return  for  the
    relevant  full financial year showed a profit of  �15,107  which  comes
    below the income threshold.  I  conclude  that  the  proper  course  of
    action is for a fresh application to be made  relying  on  the  claimed
    current  income  of  �22,000  evidenced  by  specified   documentation.
    Accordingly there is no necessity for further  submission  or  evidence
    and I remake the decision on the evidence before me.

DECISION

22.  The determination is set aside. I remake the decision by  refusing  the
    appeal.
