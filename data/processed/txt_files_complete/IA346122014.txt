                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background


    1. For the purpose of continuity with the determination in  the  First-
       tier Tribunal I will hereinafter refer to the Secretary of State  as
       the Respondent and Ms Bhavsar as the Appellant.


    2. The Respondent cancelled  the  Appellant's  leave  to  remain  as  a
       student on 22 August 2014. Her appeal against this  was  allowed  by
       First-tier Tribunal Judge  Chamberlain  ("the  Judge")  following  a
       hearing on 2 July 2015.

    3. In summary the Judge found that the Respondent had  failed  to  show
       that the Appellant's sponsorship at Alpha College had been withdrawn
       and that the  evidence  the  Respondent  produced  to  support  that
       assertion was not reliable as;
          1) there was no indication as to who had  written  the  file  note
             saying it had been withdrawn [12],
          2)  there  was  no  evidence  as  to  how  that  information   was
             communicated to the Respondent [13],
          3) there was no  evidence  from  the  other  sponsor  college  the
             Appellant is supposed to have moved to [13],
          4) there is no name on the email  of  8  August  2014  from  Alpha
             College where it was asserted  that  the  Appellant  no  longer
             studied [14],
          5) there is no evidence as to why there was a  delay  of  3  weeks
             between that information being received and it being put on the
             Respondent's system [13 and 15],
          6) there was  no  explanation  as  to  why  having  received  that
             information no action was  taken  to  curtail  the  Appellant's
             leave [15], and
          7) the email on which the Respondent was  relying  was  sent  less
             than 2 weeks before Alpha College's license was suspended, such
             were the Respondent's concerns about Alpha College.

The grant of permission


    4. First-tier Tribunal Judge Andrew granted  permission  to  appeal  (5
       January 2016) on the grounds that it is arguable that "the Judge has
       applied the incorrect standard of proof to the documents..."


Respondent's position

    5. The grounds state that the Judge "has failed to identify the correct
       burden  of  proof.  The  burden  of  proof   is   the   balance   of
       probabilities."


    6. It is asserted  in  the  grounds  that  the  Judge  "had  sufficient
       evidence before (sic) them to come to the conclusion  that  the  A's
       circumstances have changed" namely an email from Alpha College dated
       16 July 2014.  It  was  therefore  unclear  why  this  evidence  was
       unsatisfactory to conclude on the balance of probabilities that they
       had withdrawn their sponsorship.

    7. It is further asserted in the grounds that  the  Judge's  assessment
       "is based determinately upon the fact that the SSHD took three weeks
       to upload the information on the emails  to  the  SSHD's  database".
       This should not be  determinative.  A  holistic  assessment  of  her
       circumstances was required.

    8. Mr Avery conceded that the word "should" which was  referred  to  by
       the Judge in her determination at [4], [5], [11], and twice at  [17]
       means "probably". He also conceded that the Judge gave other reasons
       at [13], [14], [15] and  [16]  for  placing  little  weight  on  the
       problematic email from Alpha College.





Appellant's position


    9. There was no rule 24 notice. Having heard from Mr Avery I  indicated
       that I did not need to hear from Miss Dogra as there was plainly  no
       merit whatsoever in the application for the following reasons  which
       I gave at the hearing.

Discussion

   10. There is no merit in ground 1 at [5] above. The burden of  proof  is
       not "the balance of probabilities." The standard  of  proof  is  the
       balance of probabilities and the burden on proof (in this  case)  is
       on the Respondent. The Judge stated (my  underlining)  at  [4]  that
       "the burden of proof lies on the Respondent to show that  her  leave
       should have been cancelled". The Judge also uses  "should"  in  that
       same context at [5], [11], and twice in [17], namely when  referring
       to the standard of proof that was needed to be established. "Should"
       in normal English usage, and as  explained  in  the  Oxford  English
       Dictionary, means probably, or more likely than not.  It  is  a  non
       legal way of saying "the balance of probabilities".  The  Judge  has
       used language that the lay Appellant  understands  and  applied  the
       correct standard of proof.

   11. There is no merit in ground 2 at [6] above. The Judge gave  multiple
       reasons which I have referred to at [3]  above  explaining  why  the
       email  from  Alpha  College  was  inadequate.  The  fact  that   the
       Respondent may not agree with the Judge does not mean that the Judge
       gave inadequate reasons. The Judge's reasons were  plainly  open  to
       her on the evidence presented.

   12. There is no merit in ground 3 at [7] above. The Judge gave  multiple
       reasons which I have referred to at [3]  above  explaining  why  the
       email from Alpha College was inadequate. It was not just based on  a
       delay in uploading information.

   13. I am therefore satisfied that the Judge made no  material  error  of
       law.

Decision:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law.

      I do not set aside the decision.
