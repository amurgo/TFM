                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                                  DECISION

 1. The appellant was granted permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal
    against a decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Moxon  who,  in  a
    determination promulgated on 8 July 2019, dismissed his appeal  brought
    against the respondent's decision to refuse to issue him EEA  residence
    card under the Immigration (European Economic Area)  Regulations  2016.
    In a decision promulgated on 21  November  2019  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Hanson determined that the First-tier Tribunal's decision contained  an
    error on a point of law such that it had to be  set  aside.  A  resumed
    hearing was listed before Judge Hanson on 22 January 2020.

 2. A jointly signed consent order was received by the Upper Tribunal on 16
    January 2020. In the consent order the parties agreed to  the  disposal
    of the appeal pursuant to rule 39(1) of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
    Tribunal) Rules 2008 in accordance with the terms of the consent order.
    The respondent,  having  reviewed  further  material  provided  by  the
    appellant, no longer disputed the relationship  between  the  appellant
    and his partner and accepted that  the  relationship  was  durable.  As
    such, and given that this was the sole outstanding issue in the appeal,
    it was agreed that the Upper Tribunal remakes the decision allowing the
    appellant's appeal on the basis that he is entitled to  recognition  of
    his right of residence as an extended family member as defined  by  reg
    8(5) of the 2016 Regulations.

 3. Pursuant to rule 39 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008, the Upper Tribunal makes  a  consent  order  disposing  of  these
    proceedings and allows the appeal.

 4. The resumed hearing listed for 22 January 2020 is vacated.
