For the Appellant:     Mr R Molyneux (Solicitor)
For the Respondent:    Ms J Isherwood (HOPO)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Gurung-Thapa, promulgated on  4th  September  2014,  following  a
    hearing at Stoke on 7th August 2014.  The hearing before the judge  was
    by way of a "paper hearing" in that no  oral  evidence  or  submissions
    were presented.  In the determination, the judge dismissed  the  appeal
    of Mr Ariaz Anaaz Ali who, subsequently applied for, and  was  granted,
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal, and thus the  matter  comes
    before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Trinidad and Tobago, who was born
    on 16th November 1983.  He applied for entry clearance as a partner  of
    Shana Baksh, who had indefinite leave to remain  in  the  UK,  and  the
    couple of a child together by the name  of  Aiesha  Ali,  born  on  3rd
    September 2009, who is a British citizen.  The Respondent  refused  the
    application on 24th March 2014 on the basis that  the  Appellant  could
    not meet the requirements of Appendix FM.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim is that he married Shana Baksh on 13th June  2008
    (and not on  28th  June  2008).   He  was  uncertain  what  documentary
    evidence he should provide to show that his marriage  was  genuine  and
    subsisting (particularly in the light of the  fact  that  there  was  a
    child of the marriage) but he had submitted some documentary  evidence.
    He had also "attached the payslips for himself and his Sponsor for  the
    past year to corroborate the letter submitted by the Sponsor's employer
    confirming her annual income" (paragraph 11).

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge held that,

         "While I accept that the Sponsor's annual gross salary  as  at  the
         date of the decision was �18,720, I take  note  of  the  fact  that
         there is a child of the marriage.  This means the Appellant and the
         Sponsor would have to show an additional �3,800.  This was  at  the
         date of the decision.  I note subsequently a second child has  been
         born to the Appellant and the Sponsor  on  10th  June  2014.   This
         would mean that an additional �2,400  would  be  required  for  the
         second child.  However, I have not  taken  the  second  child  into
         consideration given the date when the Appellant  was  refused  ..."
         (paragraph 16).

    The appeal was dismissed.

Grounds of Application

 5. The grounds of application state that the judge erred  in  law  because
    paragraph E.ECP.3.1 defines a child and it is quite clear that,  for  a
    British citizen child, there was no  need  to  show  additional  earned
    income, over and above the income of �18,600 for the Appellant and  the
    Sponsor.  In giving regard to this, and overlooking the fact  that  the
    Appellant was able to point to income of �18,720, the judge  had  erred
    in law.

 6. On 24th November 2014, permission to appeal was granted on this basis.

 7. On 10th December 2014, a Rule 24 response was  entered  to  the  effect
    that the Appellant was refused on the basis that there was insufficient
    evidence provided to the ECO as required by Appendix  FM-SE.   The  ECO
    was the Sponsor had not demonstrated by the required evidence in  FM-SE
    that the income level is that required to meet the Rules.

Submissions

 8.  At the hearing before me on 14th January 2015, Mr Molyneux,  appearing
    on behalf of the Appellant, handed up a skeleton argument together with
    the Immigration Directorate Instructions which dealt with  "exceptional
    circumstances or compassionate factors (entry clearance)".  He made two
    submissions.  First, that the judge had made a clear  finding  of  fact
    that the Appellant met the  financial  requirement  because  there  was
    evidence of earnings of �18,720.  Given this, the  appeal  should  have
    been allowed.  It was not because a judge  erroneously  took  the  view
    that an extra child required an additional sum of �3,800 (see paragraph
    3) and this was wrong.  Second, if  this  was  wrong,  then  there  was
    automatically a breach of Article 8 and a breach  of  Section  55  BCIA
    (both  of  which  the  judge  had  considered  at  the   end   of   her
    determination) because if the Rules were met, there cannot be a pursuit
    of legitimate aim argument that the Respondent could employ  to  defeat
    the application.

 9. For her part, Ms Isherwood relied  upon  the  Rule  24  response.   She
    submitted that the initial refusal by the Entry Clearance  Officer  was
    on the basis that the Appellant had not provided the payslips  and  the
    bank statements.  The evidence simply had not been provided.  The judge
    himself could not point to what evidence was before  her,  and  if  the
    evidence was not set out, then the appeal could not have  been  allowed
    in accordance with the Rules.  In that event, the  challenge  that  the
    judge concluded earnings of �18,720, was immaterial.

10. In reply, Mr Molyneux submitted that this was  a  "paper  hearing"  and
    much of the evidence had been sent directly to the  hearing  centre  at
    Kingston.  The judge obviously had regard to  this.   For  example,  at
    paragraph 11, the judge refers to "attached payslips  for  himself  and
    his Sponsor" provided by the Appellant himself.  Also at  paragraph  13
    of the determination the judge observes that, "I have  also  noted  the
    payslips of the Appellant and the Sponsor for various  dates".   If  on
    that basis, the judge was satisfied  that  the  Appellant  was  earning
    �18,720 then that was the end of the matter.  It was not the end of the
    matter here because the judge again wrongly went on to  consider  there
    to be in existence a requirement for  additional  �3,800  for  a  child
    which was contrary to paragraph E-ECP.3.1.

Error of Law

11. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that  I  should  set  aside  the  decision  and  remake  the
    decision.  It is clear that the judge had regard to "attached payslips"
    (see paragraph 11) and to "the  payslips  for  the  Appellant  and  the
    Sponsor for various dates" (see paragraph  13).   On  that  basis,  the
    judge was satisfied that "the Sponsor's annual gross salary as  at  the
    date  of  decision  was  �18,720"  (paragraph   16).    The   financial
    requirements of the Rules were at that stage  satisfied.   As  for  the
    genuineness of the marriage there was  a  child  of  the  marriage  and
    indeed a second child born and the judge was not of the view that  this
    was a marriage of convenience or a  marriage  that  was  not  otherwise
    genuine and subsisting.

12. I accept Mr Molyneux's submission that if the Rules were satisfied then
    a refusal violates, not just the Immigration Rules, but also Article  8
    rights to family life, in that the decision is not in  accordance  with
    the law, is not legitimate, and is altogether disproportionate.  It  is
    on this basis also that I remake the decision under  Section  12(2)  of
    TCEA 2007.  I remake the decision on the basis of the findings  of  the
    original judge, the evidence before her, and  the  submissions  that  I
    have heard today.  For the reasons I have given above,  I  am  allowing
    this appeal.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside  the  decision  of  the
original judge.  I remake the decision as follows.  This appeal is allowed.

No anonymity order is made.
