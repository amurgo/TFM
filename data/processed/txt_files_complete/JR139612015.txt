Judgment



  JUDGE HANSON
   1. This is my judgment following a substantive judicial review hearing in
      the case of Mr Abhishek Prem  v.  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
      Department, case number JR13961 of 2015.   Before  the  tribunal  this
      morning the applicant has been represented by Mr Jagadesham of counsel
      instructed  by  Minton  Morrill   Solicitors.    The   respondent   is
      represented  by  Mr  Lewis  instructed  by  the  Government  of  Legal
      Department.


   2. The claim for judicial review was issued on 13  November  2015.   That
      challenged the refusal of the application for leave to remain  in  the
      United Kingdom as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur)  Migrant  under  the  Points
      Based System.  The date of the impugned decision is 6 October 2015.


   3.  A  detailed  chronology  is  to  be  found  at  paragraph  7  of  the
      respondent's Summary Grounds of Defence, to be found at  page  A45  of
      the judicial review bundle, which sets out the applicant's immigration
      history and the earlier refusal of his application for leave as a Tier
      1 (Entrepreneur), dated 2 August 2014.


   4. A previous claim issued in relation  to  the  earlier  decision,  case
      number JR12929 of 2014, was compromised by way  of  a  consent  order.
      Following the making of the consent order the Secretary of State wrote
      to the applicant's solicitors in a letter dated 18 June 2015,  stating
      within that letter that, in line with the consent order signed  on  10
      June 2015, she was undertaking a reconsideration of the application of
      11 September 2013 as  a  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)  Migrant  and  making
      reference to paragraph 41 of Appendix A of the Immigration Rules.


   5. The relevant part of this letter appears towards  the  end  where  the
      decision maker writes, in line  with  paragraph  41D:  "Please  submit
      evidence to demonstrate the funds on which your  client's  application
      was based remain available to him or that they have been  invested  in
      the business.  Any evidence supplied must be in the form of  specified
      documents as detailed in Appendix A of the Immigration Rules in  place
      at the date of submission."




      And a request that that information be sent by 6 July 2015


   6. The applicant's response appears in a letter dated 20 July 2015.   The
      applicant's response was that the relevant documents included firstly,
      the applicant's bank statements  over  the  last  three  plus  months,
      stamped as originals by  the  bank,  showing  that  over  �16,000  was
      available to the applicant in cash. Secondly, a State  Bank  of  India
      letter, authenticated by  an  original  seal,  confirmed  the  funding
      available from the applicant's uncle, Mr Doobey, who is a third  party
      funding source, who also funded the  applicant's  graduation  back  in
      2007.   It is stated that the bank statement showed  2,219,483  Indian
      Rupees which, at the exchange rate provided, showed capital  available
      of �22,400.


   7. The third item provided was a copy of the consent order sealed by  the
      Upper Tribunal on 22 June 2015 and then the following statement:


           "A letter dated 30 June 2015 from Lester Morrill  solicitors  to
           our client confirming that  he  had  paid  the  interim  sum  of
           �13,200 on account of costs with the sum of �774 currently being
           held on client account.  Upon the Secretary  of  State  for  the
           Home Department complying with the order of 22  June  2015  that
           the respondent do pay the applicant's  reasonable  costs  to  be
           assessed if not agreed, the  money  paid  on  an  interim  basis
           towards costs will be available  to  be  released  to  him.   We
           emphasised that the figures refer to what has been  paid  on  an
           interim basis and is significantly less than  the  actual  costs
           incurred.  In these unique circumstances where the Secretary  of
           State is indebted to our client pursuant to the  Upper  Tribunal
           order, these funds should be treated as available to our client.
            The Home Office should exercise its  discretion  and  recognise
           that those funds are  available  to  the  applicant  or  in  the
           alternative it will be perverse for the Home Office to  penalise
           him for not having immediate access to the funds."




      It was stated that that equated to a total in excess of  �51,600  made
      up of �16,000 available cash, �22,400  in  the  State  Bank  of  India
      account, �774 held in client account  on  account  of  costs  and  the
      �12,426, that the applicant submitted was lawfully due  to  him  as  a
      result of the consent order.


   8. There is reference in the documentation, in the pleadings, to the word
      'compensation'.  That I take to be a slip of the typing and  no  more,
      as the funds are not compensation in the way in  which  that  term  is
      understood in an appeal or civil litigation jurisdiction,  but  rather
      costs due and payable under the terms of a consent order.


   9. The correct  applicable  legislative  framework  is  set  out  in  the
      applicant's bundle at pages A46 to A54.  As the  application  in  this
      case was made prior to the relevant date, as recognised by  the  Upper
      Tribunal in Arshad [2016] UK UT 334 it is the Rules  in  force  at  30
      September 2013 that are applicable  to  this  matter.   Mr  Jagadesham
      confirmed at the outset that the rules provided within the bundle  are
      in fact those rules, therefore the correct rules.


  10. In relation to the reference to the funds  being  'available'  in  the
      applicant's solicitor's letter of 20 July 2015, that term is a  matter
      that was commented upon by the Upper Tribunal in Arshad,  particularly
      in  paragraph  9,  where  the  President  stated  that  'the   densely
      prescriptive nature of the Tier 1 (Entrepreneur)  regime  is  by  some
      measure the most striking feature.  At its heart  lies  a  requirement
      that all Tier applicants intend to invest a minimum sum of �50,000  in
      their prospective business enterprise.  There is an intense  focus  on
      the provenance of this money and the evidence  required  to  establish
      its existence.  Fundamentally, the sum of �50,000 must  be  available.
      This is a central and recurring theme  of  the  regime'.   The  second
      feature identified in paragraph 9 is not applicable on  the  facts  of
      this matter.


  11. The Tribunal went further in Arshad to  comment  upon  what  the  term
      'available' actually means.  Having set out an analysis  in  paragraph
      49, the President concluded that based upon  that  analysis  the  term
      'available' meant that �50,000  is  available  only  if  this  sum  is
      capable of being invested in the business within a short period of the
      grant of a Tier 1 visa.  Cases  where  this  cannot  be  effected  are
      "antithical for the clear thrust and philosophy of the rules".


  12. The applicant, in addition to the available cash that  he  had  within
      his own bank account, was relying upon third party funding in relation
      to which guidance is  provided  within  the  Immigration  Rules,  with
      specific reference to paragraphs 40 and paragraph 41SD of Appendix A.


  13. The purpose of the rules relating to third party  funding,  or  indeed
      any funding provided in relation  to  a  Tier  1  application,  is  to
      provide evidence that the funds exist  and  that  they  are  genuinely
      available.  Whether such funds exist and whether they are available is
      a question of fact and not, ordinarily, a question of law.


  14. The decision maker considered the information that had  been  provided
      in response by the applicant's solicitors, which I  have  referred  to
      previously.  But in  addition  to  that,  made  further  enquiries  in
      relation to the evidence of funds disclosed and said to originate from
      the State Bank of India.  I shall return to that matter shortly.


  15. In the refusal, the impugned decision of 6 October 2015, the  decision
      maker gave the applicant in relation to Appendix  A  'Attributes',  no
      points.  In relation to access to funds,  as  required,  the  decision
      maker wrote the following:


           "You have claimed 25 points for access to funds under  paragraph
           245DDB and Appendix A of the Immigration Rules and have provided
           bank documents from the State Bank of  India  to  an  amount  of
           �22,400 in support of  your  application.   Following  enquiries
           with the State Bank of India we have been unable to establish if
           the documents which you provided are genuine.  We have therefore
           been unable to include the documents  from  the  State  Bank  of
           India in the calculation of your  available  funds.   You  claim
           funds of �14,000 in compensation from the  Secretary  of  State.
           You are unable to include this amount  of  funds,  as  they  are
           funds not currently available.  You claim �16,528.10 of your own
           personal funds, but this is an insufficient amount to be awarded
           points under  access  to  funds.   The  Secretary  of  State  is
           therefore not satisfied that you  have  provided  the  documents
           specified under Appendix A of the Immigration Rules and you have
           been awarded no points for access to funds."




  16. In relation to funds held  in  regulated  financial  institutions,  no
      points out of the 25 claimed were awarded as  it  was  said  that  the
      decision maker had established that the applicant had not demonstrated
      that he had access to funds as required, and that the  decision  maker
      was therefore unable  to  accurately  assess  this  attribute  as  the
      applicant had not demonstrated that  the  full  amount  of  the  funds
      required was held with regulated financial institutions.  In  relation
      to funds disposable in the United Kingdom, 25 points were  claimed  of
      which none were awarded on the basis that the documents that had  been
      provided did not qualify for the award of points in this area.


  17. The Secretary of  State  within  the  Immigration  Rules  reserves  to
      herself the right to request further information and documentation  if
      required.  This is a reference to paragraph 245DD(j), but  may  decide
      not to do so if it was not appropriate or the  application  falls  for
      refusal on other grounds, paragraph 245DD(l), which may be relevant to
      why further enquiries may not have been made in relation to one matter
      if it was considered that the application will fail in  any  event  in
      relation to another matter.


  18. Permission to bring judicial review proceedings  was  granted  on  the
      papers by Upper Tribunal Judge Plimmer on 2 March 2016  on  the  basis
      that  it  was  arguable,  as  contended  in  the  grounds,  that   the
      requirements of fairness in the particular circumstances of this case,
      including its procedural history, required the respondent to give  the
      applicant an opportunity to address her concerns regarding  the  State
      Bank of India documents and to adopt a more flexible approach  to  the
      funds owed to the applicant by the respondent.


  19. The applicant's case, as set out in the pleadings and developed in the
      skeleton  argument  and  the  oral  submissions,  was  that   it   was
      procedurally unfair for the Secretary of State to  refuse  to  include
      the State Bank of India funds as a result  of  inconclusive  enquiries
      without first raising this matter with the applicant.  Secondly,  that
      the verification checks undertaken were contrary to  the  respondent's
      published policy and thirdly,  that  it  was  procedurally  unfair  to
      refuse the costs awarded as  an  element  that  could  be  taken  into
      account without properly consulting the applicant.


  20. In relation to the costs question, the respondent's liability  to  pay
      the applicants costs of the compromised claim  arises  pursuant  to  a
      consent order dated 10 July 2015 and sealed by the  Tribunal  here  in
      Manchester on 22 March 2015.  The terms of that order are as follows,


      Upon the respondent agreeing to withdraw her decision of 2 August 2014
      and to reconsider the applicant's application dated 11 September  2013
      using the Immigration Rules that applied to an  application  submitted
      on that date and which was to be determined on 2 August 2014:


        Within three months absent special circumstances, by consent it  is
        ordered that, (1) the claimant do have leave to withdraw the  above
        numbered claim for judicial review;
        (2) the respondent reserves the right to invite the  applicant  for
        an interview;
        (3) a hearing on 25 June 2006 is vacated and;
        (4) the respondent do pay the applicant's reasonable  costs  to  be
        assessed if not agreed."


  21. Just digressing very slightly in relation to the  wording  and  points
      that arose in relation to submissions made, it is clear in the recital
      that it was not a case where the decision would be made  within  three
      months, full stop, but that  circumstances  could  have  arisen  which
      warranted the three-month period being extended.  In  the  event,  the
      impugned decision was made within four months of the  sealing  of  the
      order but it has not been made out that that makes the decision in any
      way unlawful on the facts and the  material  made  available  to  this
      Tribunal.


  22. The second point, is that although it is noted the respondent insisted
      as a term in the consent order that the applicant be interviewed.   It
      was a reservation of a right to invite the  applicant  for  interview,
      not a legal requirement to conduct an interview or communicate further
      with the application in any event, absent circumstances that may  have
      warranted the same.


  23. Returning to the costs issue, the point to be noted is that the  costs
      awarded were only expressed in terms of the liability for  payment  of
      the applicant's costs, not in relation to the quantum of those  costs.
      Therefore, at that date there was in existence  only  an  unquantified
      costs order.


  24. The parties were unable  to  reach  agreement  in  relation  to  costs
      resulting in the matter being passed to a Costs Officer  of  the  High
      Court who, in an order dated 13 June 2016, quantified the respondent's
      liability in the sum of �13,881.20 composed of �12,166.20 costs of the
      claim settled by the consent order together with an addition of �1,715
      costs of the detailed assessment process.


  25. Prior to the final assessment, it is recorded in the order that a  sum
      had been paid by the Secretary of State on account of costs.  Today Mr
      Jagadesham was able, with the assistance of those instructing him,  to
      obtain a schedule confirming the payments that had been  made  by  the
      Secretary of State totalling �10,750, none  of  which  had  been  paid
      prior to the date of the impugned decision.


  26. I will mention in passing, and no more at this stage, as it was not  a
      matter that was pursued before the  Tribunal  by  Mr  Jagadesham  this
      morning, quite properly.  There is in the pleadings an assertion of  a
      lack of candour on behalf of the Secretary of State claiming that  her
      actions in not agreeing costs or making payments in  relation  to  the
      costs issue prior to the making of the impugned decision was somehow a
      deliberate act or an  act  calculated  to  frustrate  the  applicant's
      chances of success.  It was not pursued and quite rightly so, for such
      an assertion is  very  serious  and  on  the  basis  of  the  material
      available has no foundation on the facts of this case.


  27. It is not the role of this Tribunal today to get involved in satellite
      litigation relating to costs awarded or how such costs are  calculated
      save as to say that, in the respondent's skeleton argument, where this
      issue of costs and the process involved in assessing any liability for
      costs is set out, there is a reflection of the reality of the  matter.
      No party needs to pay  a  costs  award  until  such  costs  have  been
      quantified and whether a party chooses to make an offer of  a  payment
      of costs on account,  which  may  be  advisable  to  avoid  any  later
      additional costs consequences, is a matter for  them.   There  was  no
      obligation upon the Secretary of State to make any payment in relation
      to costs in light of the fact the costs were not agreed  or  reflected
      in the costs order and it appeared on the face of it that the  quantum
      of costs would not be settled without the  intervention  of  the  High
      Court.  I say no more about that, as I  say,  Mr  Jagadesham  did  not
      pursue that matter and I do not find that any assertion of a  lack  of
      candour on that basis is made out in any event.


  28. The importance of the applicant wanting the Tribunal to  consider  the
      costs award is clearly outlined by the various permutations  that  may
      be available.  It is stated at the  date  of  the  impugned  decision,
      there was only �16,528.10 that was accepted by the Secretary of  State
      as being available.  Even if the �22,400 in the State  Bank  of  India
      and the �10,750 that had been paid on account of costs  was  known  to
      the decision maker, and could be taken into account, that would  still
      have left a shortfall of �321.90; hence the assertion in the  skeleton
      argument that minimum costs that had  to  be  available  or  that  was
      subsequently shown to be available, the �11,071.90  identified  by  Mr
      Jagadesham in his skeleton argument should be included in the relevant
      calculation.


  29. In relation to the State Bank of India documents, it is  not  disputed
      that the applicant's  uncle  had  provided  evidence  of  third  party
      support earlier and it was put to the decision maker  that  that  same
      source of third party support continued to be  in  existence  and  was
      available to the applicant.


  30. The decision maker clearly considered that  in  the  circumstances  of
      this case and found it appropriate for further enquiries  to  be  made
      with the issuing authority,  namely  the  State  Bank  of  India.   Mr
      Jagadesham criticises the  fact  the  decision  maker  undertook  such
      checks, submitting that it was contrary to the  Secretary  of  State's
      published policy.  The source of  that  policy  is  in  the  published
      guidance  relating  to  applications  by  Tier  1  (Entrepreneurs)  at
      paragraph 12 where it is written as follows:
           "We may want to check for supporting  documents  you  send  with
           your application.  You must ensure that all the  evidence  comes
           from a source that can be clearly identified  and  that  we  can
           independently confirm it as being genuine.  More information  is
           given in Annex C."


      Annex C to the guidance continues:
           "1.  What may be checked.  We may want to check  the  supporting
           documents you send with your application.  Therefore,  you  must
           ensure that all the evidence comes from a  source  that  can  be
           clearly identified and that it can be independently confirmed as
           being genuine.


           "2.  When will verification  checks  be  made?   Where  we  have
           reasonable doubts that a specified document is  genuine  we  may
           want to verify  the  document  with  an  independent  person  or
           government agency.  What we consider to be  a  reasonable  doubt
           will  depend  on  the  individual  application.   However,   our
           judgment will be based on the facts we  have.   The  purpose  of
           these checks is to ensure that the document provided is  genuine
           and accurately reflects statements made in the application.  "If
           a document is being used as evidence to  score  points  we  also
           want to ensure that it entitles you to claim those points."




  31. Notwithstanding  that  that  sort  of  evidence  may  have  been  used
      previously and indeed, it  was  submitted,  was  relied  upon  by  the
      applicant in relation to previous applications  for  lawful  leave  to
      enter and remain in the United  Kingdom,  that  is  not  a  bar  to  a
      decision maker undertaking checks if the decision maker believes  that
      there is reasonable doubt warranting such checks being made.


  32. The decision itself refers to the outcome of the enquiries  undertaken
      with the State Bank of India and at this stage it is not known by  way
      of a specific response  to  the  enquiries  made  by  the  applicant's
      solicitors  why  the  decision  maker  on  this  occasion  thought  it
      reasonable to make those enquiries of the State Bank of India.


  33. What is important  in  this  case,  however,  is  the  merits  of  the
      challenge that has been made to  the  actions  that  were  undertaken.
      Such actions must be considered within the real world  of  the  points
      based   system   and   issues   regarding   documentation,   financial
      documentation received from some parts of the world,  including  India
      and the subcontinent and its neighbouring states generally.  There  is
      no bar to a decision maker undertaking verification  checks  unless  a
      subjective cause for  concern  arises  relating  specifically  to  the
      individual's circumstances.  An  individual  applicant,  dependent  on
      another person may include a reference to  those  documents  submitted
      with the application by the individual.  This was not  a  document  in
      relation to which previous questions had been asked, so far as we  are
      aware, or previous proof had been provided.  It had been  accepted  on
      its face on a previous Entry Clearance Officer and/or the Secretary of
      State.


  34. It is not arguably unreasonable for a document of this nature from the
      area within which it originates, to raise doubt in  the  mind  of  the
      Entry Clearance Officer or  the  decision  maker,  such  that  it  was
      considered that reasonable doubt may exist.   It  must  be  remembered
      that  the  only  assertion  this  was  a  genuine  document  was   the
      applicant's application relying upon the same and an indication  that,
      based on what he was saying, it was a genuine document,  just  as  the
      funds within the account were said to be genuinely available.


  35. There is a question of whether published guidance amounts  to  policy,
      but Mr Jagadesham submitted that this is a policy of the Secretary  of
      State, breach of which could give rise to an arguable public law error
      which was not a matter commented upon by Mr Lewis.  There are previous
      authorities of this Tribunal's predecessors relating to when  guidance
      amounts to policy and guidance to caseworkers per se  may  not  fulfil
      that criteria.


  36. However,  what  we  have  here  is  the  fact  that  the  checks  were
      undertaken.  In the case of  Adnan  Mushtaq  v.  The  Entry  Clearance
      Officer, a case appearing in the bundle, [2015] UKUK 224 (IAC), it was
      found by the President that a breach of the  caseworker  guidance  may
      render the decision of an ECO unlawful.  Therefore, even if there  was
      merit in Mr Jagadesham's argument in relation to the enquiries made by
      the decision maker, and for the sake of clarity I  do  not  find  that
      argument to be made out in relation to an unlawful breach of published
      policy, then that is not automatically a matter that would lead  to  a
      finding that the decision was not lawful.  McCloskey J set  out  that,
      as a general rule, a challenge advanced on  this  basis  will  succeed
      only  where  Wednesbury  irrationality  or   a   material   procedural
      irregularity  is  established.   I  shall  return  to  the  procedural
      irregularity point shortly.   In  relation  to  whether  a  Wednesbury
      irrationality has  been  established  on  the  actions  taken  by  the
      Secretary of State or the result of enquiries, it has  not  been  made
      out that that test is satisfied in relation to this matter.


  37. It was also submitted, perhaps in the alternative, that if the finding
      of this Tribunal was that the decision maker was entitled to make  the
      enquiries of the State Bank of India,  which  is  indeed  the  finding
      made, that the  methodology  and  finding  and  the  nature  of  those
      enquiries were insufficient.


  38. There was in relation to the evidence provided on this specific  point
      a submission made regarding the obligation on the Secretary  of  State
      to make disclosure within these proceedings, it being submitted by  Mr
      Jagadesham that the Secretary of State had  not  satisfied  the  legal
      obligation upon her of fairness or a duty to disclose.


  39. The evidence in relation to the enquiries made is in the form of three
      emails.  One of 29 July 2015 submitted the  documents  to  a  redacted
      recipient within the State Bank of India  in  relation  to  a  subject
      number which has not been clarified, seeking confirmation  of  whether
      those documents were genuine  or  not  genuine,  whether  the  account
      number provided belonged to the applicant's uncle, Mr Doobey  and  the
      account balance on the stated date of 11 July 2015.


  40. The Secretary of State did not receive a response and therefore,  sent
      a second email to the State Bank of India on 14 September 2015  asking
      for a reply as a matter of urgency as it related to a JR case and then
      on a third occasion on 17 September 2015 referring to the two previous
      emails attaching a document to that  third  email  and  asking  for  a
      response by 21 September as  the  matter  was  becoming  urgent.   The
      urgency of this matter probably being that caused by the inclusion  of
      the period of three months in the consent order in relation to which a
      decision would be made.


  41. That third email was  sent  to  the  State  Bank  dated  17  September
      requesting a response by 21.  On 21 September, at 22 minutes past  two
      in the afternoon, a redacted employee within  the  Home  Office  Fraud
      Centre sent an email to the decision maker stating that, as  they  had
      no response from the State Bank of India regard  the  requests  below,
      they had closed their records as inclusive.  That followed an  earlier
      email indicating that there had been no response from the  State  Bank
      of India but they were going to be chased further.


  42. In relation to the assertion that the decision maker should have  done
      more  by  way  of  making  a  telephone  call,  setting   a   'receipt
      acknowledged' reminder in the email account when sending the email, or
      should have done something beyond this, and that it  was  unreasonable
      not to do so, I do not find that that assertion has been made  out  in
      relation to this matter.


  43. It is important to consider these requests in  the  context  in  which
      they exist,  namely  established  and  negotiated  procedures  by  the
      Secretary of State, on behalf of the Government of the United Kingdom,
      with  foreign  national  governments  and/or  institutions,  and   the
      capacity of the Secretary of State or a visa  officer,  ECO  or  entry
      clearance manager, when concerns arise in  relation  to  documents  or
      evidence that has been provided.  There exists within the  appropriate
      offices confidential documents setting out the  agreed  memorandum  in
      relation to how such enquiries shall be undertaken.  These  ordinarily
      take the form of a named contact within the organisation or Government
      department in question together with an  agreed  telephone  number  or
      email address.  It is established practice, as such information is  by
      its nature confidential, that sometimes they are outside the points of
      contact disclosed on the websites for standard letter headings of  the
      banks concerned, who may have concerns that  such  information  should
      not fall into the public domain.   The  reasons  for  doing  this  are
      wholly  understandable,  and  reasonable,  namely   to   protect   the
      confidentiality of the recipient and the sender to  prevent  reprisals
      and/or action taken against them or  in  States  where  corruption  is
      rampant to try and minimise the possibility that such an individual(s)
      become corrupted to the extent that the  Secretary  of  State  or  the
      decision maker receives inaccurate information.


  44. It is similarly on the basis of the need for protection that the  name
      of the UK based UKVI Home Office Fraud Team Centre  employee  is  also
      redacted.  This is an extremely sensitive area of work in which it  is
      known that threats have been made to individuals in the past and  that
      it is necessary to try and obtain the  best  possible  information  or
      sources of confirmation in relation to enquiries made.


  45. Such enquiries as were made are reasonable.  It is  accepted  that  in
      relation to the impugned decision, and I put out of my  mind  in  this
      respect what occurred at a later date,  the  Secretary  of  State  was
      unable to obtain a reply.  I do not find that Mr Jagadesham  has  made
      out before this Tribunal that there has been any failure or breach  of
      responsibility by the Secretary of State, under the  obligations  upon
      her within these proceedings, to make full and frank disclosure or  in
      relation to  the  duty  of  fairness  concerning  the  extent  of  the
      disclosure that was made.


  46. The Secretary of State chooses to disclose documents  in  relation  to
      which certain elements have been redacted.  It is  understandable  why
      those documents were redacted.  That is the evidence the Secretary  of
      State seeks to rely upon.  If the applicant wished to receive  further
      information by way  of  further  and  better  or  seek  an  order  for
      disclosure of an unredacted copy, then  it  was  always  open  to  the
      applicant through  his  solicitors  to  make  an  application  to  the
      Tribunal that would have been considered on its merits.  I accept what
      Mr Jagadesham says, that it is common practice in  the  civil  courts,
      the High Court included, for such applications to be made and if  such
      an application is made, then appropriate orders can  be  made  with  a
      degree of flexibility that the courts and  Tribunals  have,  including
      disclosure  restricted  to  named  individuals,  including  the  legal
      representatives of those appearing in a case.


  47. It is accepted a letter was written by the applicant's  solicitors  to
      the decision maker asking various questions, but it is not a  case  in
      relation to which any formal application was made by the applicant  to
      seek further and better particular by way  of  an  order  or  to  seek
      disclosure of unredacted copies of these documents.


  48. In relation to the weight this Tribunal places upon the redacted  copy
      documents that have been provided, for the reasons set  out  above  in
      relation to the practice and procedures that exist when  dealing  with
      verification enquiries, the Tribunal accepts that  it  can  place  due
      weight upon these as it has been invited to by the Secretary of  State
      when considering whether the Secretary of State  undertook  reasonable
      enquiries.


  49. The nature of these documents and enquiries and the system that exists
      is the answer to Mr Jagadesham's question "why did  not  the  decision
      maker make a phone call?  The answer is, how does anybody know who  is
      on the other end of the  telephone  and  although  we  have  all  seen
      examples of telephone calls being made ordinarily in relation to Entry
      Clearance Officer's decisions  where  verification  checks  have  been
      made, there is no obligation upon the decision maker to go beyond  the
      processes that have been adopted in relation to  this  matter  on  the
      facts.


  50. What occurred in relation to the consent order and the  terms  of  the
      consent order does not have as strong a  bearing  on  the  State  Bank
      document as it  may  in  relation  to  the  arguments  raised  by  the
      applicant's solicitors in the  letter  following  the  making  of  the
      consent order, when they were asked to set out the applicant's case as
      to the claim, but that is a matter I shall refer to shortly.


  51. In relation to whether, having received  an  inconclusive  reply,  the
      decision maker was entitled to proceed to refuse  the  application  on
      that  basis  requires  consideration  of  both  the  guidance  and  Mr
      Jagadesham's argument that there is a duty upon the decision maker  in
      such circumstances to consult further with the applicant  and  provide
      the applicant, presumably, with the  opportunity  to  provide  further
      information or evidence to support his claim.


  52. The guidance provided to decision makers sets out the likely decisions
      that will result from  various  findings  following  the  verification
      checks i.e. whether a document is verified, secondly inconclusive  and
      thirdly, not verified.  In relation to a conclusion that a document is
      inconclusive the guidance to caseworker clearly states  that  in  that
      case no points will be awarded to that document under the criteria  in
      relation  to  which  that  document  relates.   That  is  an  arguably
      reasonable and rational conclusion.   A  document  being  inconclusive
      means it does not put an end to any doubt or question. It  is  settled
      that the burden of proving an entitlement to points under the  Tier  1
      (Entrepreneur) points based system  route  falls  upon  the  applicant
      himself.


  53. In relation to the public law duty, if it exists upon the Secretary of
      State, in terms of the general public law  duty  of  fairness  in  the
      context of the points based system, I have been referred by  Mr  Lewis
      at length to a decision of the Court of Appeal in EK
      (Ivory Coast) v. Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  [2014]
      EWCA Civ 1517.


  54. Whether there was any further duty upon the Secretary of State  to  go
      beyond the rejection of the State Bank of India  document  may  depend
      upon an assessment of whether the Secretary of State  herself  was  in
      any way responsible for or contributed  to  the  unfairness  that  the
      applicant states had arisen.


  55. It was settled in the case by the Court of Appeal  that  there  is  no
      obligation  upon  the  Secretary  of  State  in  recognition  of   the
      principles of fairness to return and consult further with an applicant
      for leave under the points based  system  in  circumstances  where  no
      culpability on behalf of the Secretary of State had been established.


  56. In relation to the State Bank of India document, it is clear that what
      happened is  that  once  the  decision  maker  had  reasonable  doubt,
      standard processes were followed in relation to attempting  to  verify
      the documents, that the State Bank of India did not respond  to  those
      verification requests, as a result of which the matter was found to be
      inconclusive.  It has not been made out that in the procedure  adopted
      by the Secretary of State in reaching the point at which the documents
      were found to be inconclusive, any procedural irregularity  arises  in
      the actions taken by the decision maker.  It has  not  been  made  out
      that the decision maker has in any way contributed to, in full  or  in
      part, to the failure of the State Bank of India to fail to respond  to
      the original email and the two reminders sent.


  57. It has therefore not been established on the facts of this matter that
      there was any legal obligation on the Secretary of State to advise the
      applicant of the outcome of the enquiries or lack of response from the
      State Bank of India before proceeding to make the  impugned  decision.
      I accept, and I have looked very carefully at the  point  made  by  Mr
      Jagadesham, that during  the  course  of  these  proceedings  at  that
      relevant time there was correspondence and communication  between  the
      applicant's solicitors and the decision maker indicating that  avenues
      of such communication lay open to the decision maker so it  could  not
      have been an issue of "we could not make such contact".  But that does
      not impose a legal obligation on public law grounds upon the  decision
      maker to make such contact.  The impugned decision  is  challenged  on
      the basis that there was such a lawful obligation and that the failure
      to exercise that warrants this case being allowed in  the  applicant's
      favour.  It is my primary finding that no such  legal  obligation  has
      been made out on the facts in relation to  the  State  Bank  of  India
      document following the guidance in the judgment of EK  (Ivory  Coast).
      In that respect, I accept Mr Lewis's submissions and skeleton argument
      on this point.


  58. As a result, this claim must fail as it was clearly a material part of
      the applicant's case that the �22,400 it is said was available in  the
      State Bank of India account forms part of the �50,000 minimum sum that
      he was required to meet the requirements of the Rules.  On  the  basis
      that the evidence before the decision maker  did  not  show  that  due
      weight could be put upon the documents from the State Bank  of  India,
      the conclusion of the  decision  maker  that  the  applicant  had  not
      discharged the burden upon him to show he was entitled to  the  points
      sought in relation to the availability of funds, which I  referred  to
      earlier, is  one  fully  within  the  range  of  reasonable  decisions
      available.  It has not been shown to be susceptible  to  challenge  on
      public law grounds for the reasons stated.


  59. I will, for the sake of completeness, comment upon  the  costs  issue.
      That is a matter in relation to which this Tribunal was addressed.   I
      stated earlier that the Bank of India document was not affected by the
      terms of the consent order and the impact of the terms of the  consent
      order in the same way that  the  costs  issue  may  be.   It  was  not
      suggested that as a result of any action on behalf of the Secretary of
      State, or as a result of any subsequent order made  and  need  to  re-
      assess, that there had been any impact upon the  funds  in  the  State
      Bank of India account.


  60. It was asserted however, by the applicant, that as  a  result  of  the
      costs order made and the costs history of the litigation, that he  has
      been unfairly prejudiced by what developed in the decision  maker  not
      taking the amount of the costs that  he  claims  he  was  entitled  to
      properly into account.


  61. I referred earlier to the calculation that showed that had the �22,400
      been shown to be  available,  the  applicant  would  still  have  been
      required to show that he had available to him  funds  in  the  sum  of
      �11,071.90.  The  applicant's  case  is  that  during  the  course  of
      litigation,  as  he  is  privately  funded  in   relation   to   these
      proceedings, he had paid on account of costs to  his  legal  advisors,
      �13,200.  It is understandable, that if that �13,200  had  still  been
      available and the �22,400 shown to be available,  that  the  applicant
      would have discharged the burden of proof upon him to show that he had
      the required sum of a minimum of �50,000.


  62. The argument that has been put forward, that it  is  therefore  unfair
      that having had to spend that sum of money  to  fund  his  litigation,
      litigation which was compromised as a result  of  what  Mr  Jagadesham
      refers to as an unlawful decision by the Secretary of State, that  the
      applicant should therefore be prejudiced by  the  decision  maker  not
      taking into account the amount of any costs that would be subsequently
      awarded following the agreement or assessment as  part  of  the  costs
      available to  the  applicant.   The  difficulty  with  that  argument,
      although in theory it has some merit, is that it does  not  appear  on
      the face of it that any action was taken by the  applicant  to  ensure
      that such costs could be properly shown to be available.


  63. The consent order  provided  a  timeline  in  relation  to  which  the
      decision had to be made by the Secretary of State.  That was a consent
      order and although 'three months' absence special circumstances' is  a
      standard  time  indicated  in  such  reconsideration  orders  by   the
      Secretary of State, it was clearly agreed by the applicant too.


  64. It must have been known to the parties to these proceedings  that  the
      quantum of costs had not been determined towards the end or  near  the
      end of that three-month period.  It is also  of  note  that  when  one
      looks at the solicitor's letter responding to the request for evidence
      of an ability to comply with paragraph 41 and 41SD the solicitors  set
      out the point of principle that I raised earlier of what is said to be
      the irrationality/ unfairness in the Secretary of State not taking the
      costs into account.  Without addressing  the  practical  point  as  to
      whether it would have been possible within the time  period  specified
      for the quantum of such costs to have been known, the applicant's case
      was advanced to the decision maker on the basis that as �13,200  costs
      had been paid out on account that figure, or something similar, should
      have been taken into account by the decision maker.  Such argument has
      no merit in public law or on any other basis.  It is known  that  what
      sum a party may pay to their solicitor is  not  necessarily  the  same
      and, ordinarily, can be substantially less than any costs  that  would
      be awarded if an assessment is required to be made.


  65. The reality of the matter, as stated, is  that  the  amount  of  those
      costs were not known or quantified until the High Court costs order on
      13 June 2016.  I accept the argument advanced by Mr Lewis in  relation
      to whether the decision maker should have been, under  the  provisions
      of  the  Rules  and  particularly  paragraph  41SD,  the  purpose  and
      structure of the points based system as referred to by  the  Court  of
      Appeal in EK (Ivory Coast), been required  to  take  into  account  an
      unquantified sum of money.


  66. The reality is that there is a very prescriptive set  of  requirements
      set out in the Rules and guidance so  far  as  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)
      applications are concerned.  I referred earlier to the finding of  the
      Upper Tribunal in Arshad, that in particular what needs to be shown is
      that such funds exist and are available.  It could not be made out  at
      the date the decision was made, on the basis of the information before
      the decision maker, that the required sum would have been available or
      'existed' and would have been available to the applicant  such  as  to
      enable him to show the minimal requirement of  �50,000  was  available
      had the �22,400 been capable of being taken into account.


  67. I can understand the frustration and unfairness felt by the applicant,
      particularly in relation to this aspect  of  the  matter,  but  it  is
      settled law that there is no legal obligation upon  the  Secretary  of
      State to make a decision that each or  every  party  considers  to  be
      fair.  The question of fairness  in  relation  to  decisions  of  this
      nature and challenges by way of judicial review must be considered  in
      relation to a general public law duty of fairness in  the  context  of
      the points based system, not in isolation of  it,  as  indeed  we  are
      reminded by the Court of Appeal, Sales LJ in paragraph 1 of EK  (Ivory
      Coast).


  68. I do not know why, if the applicant needed those additional  costs  to
      be returned/paid to him to show they were  available,  representations
      were not made by those representing the applicant to delay the  making
      of the decision or to agree a variation of  the  consent  order.   The
      points made by Mr Jagadesham in relation to that matter that  fairness
      would dictate that perhaps these matters should have been  taken  into
      account, had the value of such sums been known prior to the  decision,
      may have arguable merit but there was no obligation upon the Secretary
      of State of her own motion to effectively agree to  the  postpone  the
      matter beyond the terms of the consent order that had been  sealed  by
      this Tribunal.  I find that responsibility for  the  failure  to  seek
      such appropriate period of delay for such costs to be quantified falls
      upon the applicant or his legal representatives.


  69. I therefore find in relation to the two sums in question, the  sum  of
      �22,400 and the question of costs arising out  of  the  consent  order
      referred to earlier, that it has not been made out  on  a  public  law
      basis that there  is  any  arguable  unfairness  in  relation  to  the
      procedure or approach adopted by the decision  maker  in  relation  to
      assessing the merits in terms of the very restrictive requirements  of
      the points based system.  On that basis, this claim must be dismissed.
                           _______________________
