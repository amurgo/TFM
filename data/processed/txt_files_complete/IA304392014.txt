                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge M A Khan, promulgated on 23rd September 2015, following a hearing
    at Hatton Cross on 25th August 2015.  In the determination,  the  judge
    allowed  the  appeal  of  Mehdi  Nadjar,   whereupon   the   Respondent
    subsequently applied for and was granted, permission to appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Algeria, who  was  born  on  15th
    August 1985.  He  appealed  against  the  decision  of  the  Respondent
    refusing his application  for  a  residence  card  alleging  that  this
    decision was in breach of  his  European  Community  law  rights  under
    Regulation 7 because his marriage  was  genuine  and  was  not  one  of
    convenience.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim is that his friend Georgois, who was a witness in
    the case before the Tribunal, attended his wedding and  he  pointed  to
    some photographs showing him, his wife, and  Georgois.   The  Appellant
    said that he and his wife had been living together for  more  than  two
    years.  He said that after their wedding  they  went  to  a  restaurant
    called Fredrick to celebrate.  His marriage is genuine  and  they  have
    been together  for  three  years.   They  intend  to  live  permanently
    together.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge observed how the Appellant and his EEA national Sponsor  were
    interviewed on 29th May 2014 and they were asked questions about  their
    relationship, each other's families, and their  marriage.   There  were
    many inconsistencies between the answers given by the Appellant and his
    EEA Sponsor.  It was a long interview.  The judge accepted  that  there
    were inconsistencies and  found  no  credible  explanation  as  to  why
    personal details about  each  other  were  not  known  to  the  parties
    involved (see paragraph 27).

 5. Another striking issue in the appeal was that the Appellant had put  an
    advert in Gumtree in 2003 for a European girl, in order to  assist  him
    and his fellow students, as he claims, to secure a  tenancy  agreement.
    He said that his landlord wanted a European to provide evidence for the
    tenancy agreement to be given.  The judge held that he did  not  accept
    the  Appellant's  evidence  as  credible  or  consistent.   This   was,
    "especially in the light of the  fact  the  Appellant  and  his  fellow
    students were lawfully resident in the UK, they did not need pay  slips
    or any other evidence to secure a tenancy agreement" (paragraph 28).

 6. The judge then relied upon the case of  Miah  (Interviewer's  comments:
    disclosure: fairness) [2014] UKUT 00515  where  the  president  of  the
    Tribunal referred to Rule 13 of the Procedure Rules requiring there  to
    be disclosure of, "any other unpublished document which is referred  to
    in a document mentioned ... or relied upon  by  the  Respondent".   The
    reliance upon this case  was  because,  as  the  judge  observed,  "the
    Respondent has failed to produce these  interviews  in  evidence.   The
    Appellant's representatives wrote to the Respondent  on  two  occasions
    asking for a record of these  interviews.   The  Respondent  failed  to
    respond" (paragraph 32).

 7. The judge went on to conclude that since it was the Respondent who  was
    alleging that the Appellant has entered into a marriage of  convenience
    with his EEA national spouse in order to secure his leave to remain  in
    the United Kingdom, and since the  burden  of  proof  rested  upon  the
    Respondent,  that  burden  had  not  been  discharged,   "despite   his
    representative's request" (paragraph 34).

 8. Accordingly, the Appellant's appeal was allowed.

Grounds of Application

 9. The grounds of application state that whilst it  was  unfortunate  that
    the complete marriage interview transcript was unavailable, the parties
    did  have  access  to  the  refusal  letter   which   highlighted   the
    discrepancies considered  by  the  Secretary  of  State  to  have  been
    important, and of particular significance was the Appellant's advert on
    Gumtree in which he offers to pay �1,800 to a European girl  in  return
    for an unspecified  favour.   The  reasons  given  by  the  judge  were
    inadequate.

10. On 10th February 2016, permission to appeal was granted.

Submissions

11. At the hearing before me, Ms Brocklesby-Weller submitted that the judge
    had erred because at paragraph 27 of the determination  the  judge  had
    found  serious  credibility  shortcomings  in  the  evidence.   If  the
    Appellant were to complain that the transcript of the interview had not
    been  disclosed,  he  nevertheless  had  the   refusal   letter   which
    highlighted the relevant issues.  In these circumstances, the  reliance
    upon Miah was misconceived  and  did  not  automatically  lead  to  the
    conclusion that the Secretary of State  had  failed  to  discharge  the
    burden of proof that was upon her.

12. For his part, Mr Lam submitted that the judge had  considered  all  the
    evidence in its entirety.  There was no interview  record.   Therefore,
    the source of the suspicion could not be checked.  The  judge  accepted
    the refusal letter.  The Appellant  and  the  Sponsor  attended  court.
    They gave evidence.  The  judge  gave  comprehensive  reasons  for  his
    decision.  The decision could not be challenged because  the  onus  was
    upon the Secretary of State  to  show  that  this  was  a  marriage  of
    convenience and this could not be done  if  there  had  not  been  full
    disclosure of the documents relied upon.

13. Second, however, Mr Lam submitted that if the  Tribunal  was  not  with
    him, then the matter should be remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal
    for the interview record.  At the moment, all one had  was  a  "summary
    interview record sheet" but this was culled from the  interview  record
    itself and could not be  wholly  reliable.   Mr  Lam  relied  upon  the
    Appellant's Rule 24 response of 15th March 2016.  At  the  moment  what
    one had was  not  a  verbatim  summary.   It  was  secondary  evidence.
    Directions should be given for the interview record to be produced.

14. In reply, Ms Brocklesby-Weller submitted that this was a  most  unusual
    decision because the judge had found there to  be  inconsistencies  and
    found the Appellant's account in relation to why he had advertised  for
    a European girl on Gumtree to be unconvincing, and yet had allowed  the
    appeal.

Error of Law

15. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that  I  should  set  aside  the  decision  and  remake  the
    decision.  My reasons are as follows.

16. First, there is the issue of compliance with the Procedure  Rules.   In
    the case of Miah (Interviewer's comments: disclosure: fairness)  [2014]
    UKUT 00515, the president explained (see paragraph 20) how  under  Rule
    13 of the Procedure Rules, once the Respondent is served with a copy of
    the Notice of Appeal by the First-tier Tribunal, "it must ... file with
    the Tribunal a copy of ... any  other  unpublished  document  which  is
    referred to in  a  document  mentioned  ...".   The  language  of  this
    provision is mandatory.  It suggests that the Respondent  Secretary  of
    State, insofar as it chooses to place reliance upon a document  in  the
    refusal letter, must serve on the other side any unpublished  document,
    upon which it relies.

17. In this case, the Respondent relied upon the  interview  notes.   These
    interview notes have sadly gone missing and all we  have  is  simply  a
    transcript of the notes to the interview.  Whereas the judge was  right
    in holding that the mandatory nature of this provision requires service
    of the unpublished document, failing which, the  Respondent  cannot  be
    said to have discharged the burden of proof that is upon her,  that  is
    not the end of the story.

18. Second, the reason for this  is  that  there  was  additional  evidence
    before  the  judge.   That  evidence  was  equally  available  to   the
    Appellant's side as well.  This was in the form of an advert placed  by
    the Appellant himself, prior to his getting married, where he asked for
    a "European girl for a favour in London" stating that he is willing  to
    pay �1,800 for this favour.  This advert was shown to the Appellant and
    his sponsoring spouse.  In the determination (see paragraph 16)  it  is
    recorded that, as far as the Appellant was concerned, "he admitted that
    he had placed the advert on Gumtree but could not give any  explanation
    why".  The judge found the Appellant's explanation in relation to  this
    advert (see paragraph 28) to be unconvincing holding that,  "I  do  not
    accept the Appellant's evidence as credible or consistent".  That would
    have been enough for the judge to  come  to  the  firm  view  that  the
    Respondent Secretary of State had indeed discharged the burden of proof
    that was upon her.

19. There is, however, a third reason.  This is the judge's own finding  in
    relation to the credibility of both  the  Appellant  and  the  Sponsor.
    Here the judge observes that, "having read the interview, I do not find
    it credible the Appellant would not know why his wife came to  the  UK,
    when she entered this country and his spouse did not know what  he  had
    been studying" (see paragraph 27).  It could be said that  this  was  a
    matter that was drawn directly from the interview  notes,  and  because
    the interview notes were not disclosed to the  Appellant,  and  because
    there had been no compliance with the Procedure Rules, the judge cannot
    rely upon this evidence.

20. However, if one looks at the findings of the judge to the effect  that,
    "I find that if  the  Appellant  and  his  spouse  were  in  a  genuine
    relationship, they would be aware of each other's circumstances".  This
    conclusion is at odds with the judge having allowed the appeal.  It  is
    an error of law.

Remaking the Decision

21. I have remade the decision on the basis of the findings of the original
    judge, the evidence before him, and the submissions that I  have  heard
    today.  Mr Lam, in his eloquent, clear, and measured  submissions,  has
    suggested that this appeal be remitted back to the First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge with a direction that  the  interview  notes  be  disclosed.   Ms
    Brocklesby-Weller on her part,  however,  submits  that  the  interview
    notes are not available any longer and have  been  mislaid.   All  that
    there is  is  a  "summary  interview  record  sheet".   Under  Practice
    Statement 7.2, the Upper  Tribunal  "is  likely  on  each  occasion  to
    proceed to remake the decision, instead of remitting the  case  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal" unless it is a case that the nature or  extent  of
    the fact-finding exercise is such that it is appropriate to  remit  the
    case to the First-tier Tribunal.

22. I do not find that to be the case here.  Clear findings  of  fact  were
    made by the judge.  He did not find the Appellants to be in  a  genuine
    relationship.  He did not find their answers to be  consistent  to  the
    questions put to them.  But most importantly,  the  Appellant  admitted
    having placed the advert in Gumtree and the explanation he gave  before
    the Tribunal was considered to be singularly unconvincing to the judge,
    on a balance of probabilities.

23. In these circumstances, notwithstanding Mr  Lam's  valiant  efforts  to
    persuade me otherwise,  I  find  that  the  Appellant's  appeal  cannot
    succeed, notwithstanding the fact that there has  not  been  compliance
    with the Procedure Rules, because the matters that I have  referred  to
    in the determination stand separately from the Procedure Rules.

Notice of Decision

24. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside the decision of
    the original judge.  I remake the decision as follows.  This appeal  is
    dismissed.

25. No anonymity direction is made.
