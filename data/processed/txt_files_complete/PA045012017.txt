                      ERROR OF LAW DECISION AND REASONS

    1.     The Appellant is a national of  Albania,  born  on  15.5.99.  He
    arrived in the  United  Kingdom  on  24.10.15  and  claimed  asylum  on
    27.10.15 on the basis  that  he  was  a  victim  of  trafficking  as  a
    consequence of which he feared persecution on return to Albania.

    2.     His asylum application  was  refused  by  the  Respondent  in  a
    decision dated 27.4.17 and his appeal against that decision came before
    First-tier Tribunal Judge  Davidson  for  hearing  on  13.11.17.  In  a
    decision and reasons promulgated on 29.11.17 the  Judge  dismissed  the
    appeal on the basis that he did not find the Appellant's evidence to be
    credible; there were implausibilities  in  his  account  and  he  could
    relocate internally within Albania where  there  is  a  sufficiency  of
    protection.

    4.     An application for permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal
    was made in time on 13.12.17 in which it was  asserted  that:  (i)  the
    Judge's findings in relation to the Appellant's statement  as  to  what
    had occurred in Albania and core aspect of his trafficking  claim  were
    inadequate; (ii) the negative credibility finding related primarily  to
    the Appellant's travel out of Albania rather than his account of  being
    trafficked within Albania and the Netherlands, both of  which  accorded
    with the background evidence; (iii) the Judge  failed  to  take  proper
    account of the Appellant's age at all material times; (iv) the  Judge's
    findings were made in  a  vacuum   without  regard  to  the  background
    material (v) the findings on internal  relocation  and  sufficiency  of
    protection are barely reasoned, inadequate and fail to engage with  the
    Appellant's age and lack of family support.

    5.     Permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  was  granted  in  a
    decision of Upper Tribunal Judge Martin dated 4.1.18 on the basis  that
    it was arguable that the decision and reasons  does  not  engage  fully
    with the evidence and that the reasoning is inadequate.

    Hearing

    6.     At the hearing before me, Mr Wilding fairly  accepted  that  the
    Judge had inter alia entirely  failed  to  engage  with  events  within
    Albania and he agreed with Mr Collins that it would be appropriate  for
    the appeal to be remitted for a hearing de novo before the  First  tier
    Tribunal.

    7.     In light of Mr Wilding's helpful concession that the Judge  made
    a material error of law in his  decision,  which  I  find  renders  the
    entirety of that decision unsustainable, there is no need for me to  go
    on to consider the other grounds of appeal.

    Decision

    8.     The decision of First tier Tribunal Judge Davidson is set  aside
    and the appeal is remitted for a hearing de  novo  before  a  different
    Judge of the First tier Tribunal.
