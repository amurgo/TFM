Representation
For the Appellant:     Mr M West, counsel, instructed by Kalam Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms K Pal, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is a national of Bangladesh, born on 1 January 1992.  He
      appeals  with  permission  against  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge promulgated on 21 November 2018, dismissing his  appeal
      against the decision of the respondent dated 9 January 2018 to  refuse
      to grant him leave to remain as the spouse of [SS].

   2. It was accepted that the appellant could not succeed under the  Rules.
      The appellant satisfied the suitability,  relationship  and  financial
      requirements of Appendix FM [10]. The  English  language  requirements
      had not been complied with. He acknowledged that the 2010  certificate
      submitted in support of the appeal had expired. He  contended  however
      that given his qualifications and ability to give evidence in  English
      at the hearing, he would be able to pass an English language  test  at
      the required level.

   3. He contended that the decision breaches his family life  rights  under
      Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention.

   4. The Judge found at [13] that it has been established on a  balance  of
      probabilities that he is in a genuine and subsisting relationship with
      his wife. It is further established that she suffers from  severe  eye
      difficulties and that the parties have been  undergoing  a  course  of
      fertility treatment.

   5. He stated that whilst it may be that  the  relationship  between  them
      commenced when the appellant held leave to be in the UK, by  the  time
      of his marriage in April 2016, he had become an overstayer in December
      2014.

   6. He found that it has not been  shown  that  there  are  insurmountable
      obstacles to the parties living in Bangladesh. Treatment is  available
      for the appellant's wife  there.  The  fact  that  the  cost  of  some
      medication would be beyond the means of the parties is  a  consequence
      of no weight [13]. Whilst it is accepted that he is fluent in English,
      the position  nevertheless  remains  that  he  has  not  provided  the
      specified  evidence  showing  that  he  meets  the  English   language
      requirements under the Rules. The 2010  certificate  relied  upon  has
      long expired.

   7. Should she choose to do so, the appellant's wife can remain in the  UK
      to continue her treatment. For his part, the appellant can  return  to
      Bangladesh to make an out of country application for  entry  clearance
      [13].

   8. The Judge directed himself  in  accordance  with  various  authorities
      which he has identified at [14]. Whilst it  is  acknowledged  that  he
      might endure some hardship on return to Bangladesh, where he  is  very
      familiar with its culture and the way of life, such hardship does  not
      engage the guidance set out  by  the  President  of  the  Tribunal  in
      Treebhawon and Others.

   9. His wife cannot insist that her husband should be entitled to live  in
      the UK when he might lawfully be refused leave to enter or remain. The
      "mere hardship" that the appellant might  endure  is  insufficient  to
      make a finding of "insurmountable obstacles" [16].

  10. He considered the provisions of s.117B of the 2002 Act. He referred to
      the decision in  R  (on  the  application  of  Chen)  (Appendix  FM  -
      Chikwamba - Temporary Separation -  proportionality)  IJR  [2015]  189
      (IAC).

  11. He referred to the decision in Bibi and Another, R (on the application
      of) v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 322. By a majority decision  the  court  of
      appeal held that the English language requirements for an  application
      for leave to enter as a spouse did not amount  to  a  disproportionate
      interference into rights protected under Article 8 of the Human Rights
      Convention.  The  requirement  had  a   rational   and   proportionate
      justification for the purpose of any perceived discrimination for  the
      purpose of Art 14/Art 8 ECHR.

  12. On 28 December 2018, First-tier Tribunal Judge  Grimmett  granted  the
      appellant permission to appeal. It was arguable that he  erred  as  it
      appears that the rules were met save for the English language test and
      the appellant has significant ability in English. It is also  arguable
      that the Judge erred in the lack of consideration of  the  appellant's
      wife's medical problems.

  13. On behalf of the  appellant,  Mr  West,  who  did  not  represent  the
      appellant at the hearing, adopted the grounds  of  appeal:  The  Judge
      erred in  failing  to  engage  with  the  fact  that  the  appellant's
      circumstances fell within the scope of Chikwamba, supra.  He  referred
      to the decision in Agyarko and Ikuga R (On the application of) v  SSHD
      [2017] UKSC 11 where it was held that whether the applicant is in  the
      UK unlawfully, or is entitled to remain in the  UK  only  temporarily,
      however, the significance of this consideration depends  on  what  the
      outcome of the immigration control might otherwise be. For example, if
      an applicant would otherwise be automatically deported  as  a  foreign
      criminal then the weight of the public interest in his or her  removal
      would generally be  very  considerable.  If,  on  the  other  hand  an
      applicant - even if residing in the  UK  unlawfully  -  was  otherwise
      certain to be granted leave to enter, at least if an application  were
      made from outside the UK, then there might be no  public  interest  in
      his or her removal. The  point  is  illustrated  by  the  decision  in
      Chikwamba.

  14. He submitted that on the evidence before the Tribunal,  it  was  clear
      that if the appellant were to make an application for entry  clearance
      as a partner from abroad, it would 'most certainly' be successful. Had
      the Judge properly engaged with that point, he would have  been  bound
      to find that there is no public interest in  the  appellant's  removal
      and the respondent's decision is accordingly disproportionate.

  15. He submitted that the suitability  and  relationship  requirements  of
      Appendix FM were satisfied as were the financial requirements  as  his
      partner receives personal independence payments  and  accordingly  the
      appellant does not have to meet the income threshold of ï¿½18,600.

  16. He has to show  that  his  partner  is  able  to  maintain  themselves
      adequately  without  recourse  to  public  funds.   The   calculations
      demonstrated that his partner's weekly net income after  deduction  of
      weekly housing costs is greater than the weekly net  income  that  the
      appellant and his partner would have received if they were in  receipt
      of income support.

  17. There was ample evidence before the  Tribunal  that  he  would  almost
      certainly be able to pass an English language  test  in  speaking  and
      listening at a minimum of Level A1 of the CEFR for  language.  He  had
      passed the IELTS with an overall score of 5.0, Level B1  of  the  CEFR
      for language. He held a diploma in law and is a second year LLB (Hons)
      student. This is a case where the appellant would be able to gain  the
      specified certificate within a matter of days, having  regard  to  the
      findings referred to.

  18. He submitted that the finding by the Judge at  [16]  that  no  grounds
      have  been  established  to  grant  leave   outside   the   rules   in
      circumstances in which refusal would  result  in  unjustifiably  harsh
      consequences for the appellant is "perverse." The finding  that  there
      were no insurmountable obstacles in the circumstances,  amounts  to  a
      material error of law. The Judge did not reject the evidence, set  out
      in the sponsor's witness statement at paragraph 11, that his partner's
      medication, Humira 40, is either not available in  Bangladesh,  or  if
      available, would be too expensive to afford.

  19. The 'crucial' finding at [13] that the cost of some of the  medication
      would be beyond the means of the  parties  'is  a  consequence  of  no
      weight,' constituted an error because:

     a) there was a letter from Dr Pasu dated 29 September 2017 at page  17
        who stated that if the specialist treatment  is  stopped  then  the
        appellant's  partner's  vision   will   be   negatively   impacted.
        Accordingly, the fact that the cost of some of the medication would
        be beyond  the  means  of  the  appellant  and  his  partner  is  a
        consequence of significant weight  and  directly  relevant  to  the
        insurmountable obstacles assessment;

     b) the Judge provided no reasons for the finding. It is trite law that
        the Judge is under a duty to give adequate  reasons:  MK  (Duty  to
        Give Reasons) Pakistan [2013] UKUT 00641;

     c)  the  Judge  undertook  an   inadequate   assessment   of   whether
        insurmountable obstacles would be faced by his partner, or  whether
        she would be able to  accompany  him  to  Bangladesh.  However,  in
        stating  that  she  would  find  no  insurmountable  obstacles   in
        Bangladesh, ignores the fact that she would not be able to  receive
        adequate treatment. That was a  matter  directly  relevant  to  the
        insurmountable obstacles assessment.

  20. There was no reference in  the  respondent's  decision  regarding  the
      adequacy of treatments available to her.

  21. In his witness statement before the  Tribunal,  the  appellant  stated
      that they are in receipt of IVF treatment and both must  attend  every
      appointment. It is not possible for his wife to relocate to Bangladesh
      on account of her critical condition. His village is over  300km  from
      the capital. There are no specialist eye hospitals in  his  town.  His
      wife would have to travel from the village to  the  capital,  a  12-14
      hour journey by train, in order to obtain treatment. Further,  steroid
      medication  makes  her  bones  weak  and  fragile,  and  she  is  also
      susceptible to joint pains, nausea and migraines.

  22. Mr West submitted that the Judge's finding amounts to a bare assertion
      which has been rebutted.

  23. Finally, there was no evidence as to the  length  of  his  absence  in
      taking the English test. Any period would be disproportionate.

  24. On behalf of the respondent, Ms Pal noted that the appellant  did  not
      satisfy the relevant English language requirements. She accepted  that
      he could satisfy it. The Judge set out the two  available  choices  to
      the sponsor at [16]. She could either visit her husband in  Bangladesh
      for a short period or remain in the UK.  There  was  moreover  an  eye
      hospital available, albeit situated  at  a  great  distance  from  the
      village where they would stay. They were however not obliged  to  stay
      there. The sponsor's benefits could continue.

  25. She submitted that  in  the  circumstances,  the  Judge  has  properly
      considered the issues  and  has  made  a  sustainable  proportionality
      assessment.

      Assessment

  26. The Judge was referred  to  the  decision  of  the  Supreme  Court  in
      Agyarko.  Even if the applicant was residing in the UK unlawfully, and
      he was otherwise certain to be granted leave to enter, at least if  an
      application was made from outside the  UK,  then  there  might  be  no
      public interest in his removal. It was noted that this was illustrated
      by the decision in Chikwamba.

  27. The evidence before the First-tier Tribunal was to  the  effect  that,
      apart from the English language requirement  under  Appendix  FM,  the
      appellant met the other requirements.

  28. There was  however  ample  evidence  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal
      testifying to the appellant's ability to pass an English language test
      in speaking and listening at a minimum of Level A1  of  the  CEFR  for
      languages required by section E-ECP. 4.1.(b) of Appendix  FM.  He  had
      passed an IELTS with an overall score of 5.0. More  significantly,  he
      was at the time registered as a second year LLB (Hons) student.

  29. Further, there  was  cogent  evidence  relating  to  his  wife's  very
      significant medical problems. The failure to make any finding relating
      to the adequacy of treatment was a matter that was  directly  relevant
      to any assessment of whether there would be insurmountable  obstacles.
      Her medication was not shown to be available in Bangladesh or  if  so,
      whether it would be too expensive to afford. The Judge has thus  given
      no reasons for the assertion that treatment would be available for her
      in Bangladesh.

  30. There was however evidence before the Tribunal  that  if  her  medical
      treatment were stopped, her vision would be negatively  impacted.  She
      has been undergoing specialist treatment in that respect as is evident
      from a letter from Dr Pasu produced at  page  17  of  the  appellant's
      bundle.

  31. In the circumstances I find that the making of  the  decision  by  the
      First-tier Tribunal involved the making of material errors of  law.  I
      accordingly set aside the decision.

  32. In re-making the decision, I have had regard to the  evidence  already
      referred to in this decision.

  33. The only outstanding requirement under  Appendix  FM  related  to  the
      production of the relevant English language certificate.

  34. I find that the appellant would  be  able  to  provide  the  specified
      evidence relating to the English language  certificate  with  relative
      ease. He has already passed an English language test in  speaking  and
      listening at a minimum of Level A1 of the CEFR for languages.  He  had
      passed an IELTS with an overall score of 5.0 which is at level  B1  of
      the CEFR for languages. He also holds a  diploma  in  Law  and  was  a
      second year LLB (Hons) student. The First-tier Tribunal Judge  himself
      noted and accepted that the appellant was able to give fluent evidence
      in English [13].

  35. I thus find that if the appellant were to  make  an  application  from
      abroad, he would be certain to be granted leave to enter.

  36. In the circumstances, I find that there would be no public interest in
      his removal. He would be separated from his wife for a period. She  is
      dependent on the continued receipt of Humira 40.  The  fact  that  the
      cost of the medication would be beyond the means of the parties, is  a
      matter of considerable consequence. If his wife's specialist treatment
      is stopped, her vision will be negatively  impacted.  She  would  face
      insurmountable obstacles were she to be required to accompany  him  to
      Bangladesh.

  37. Having regard to the evidence as a whole, I find that the decision  of
      the respondent constitutes a disproportionate interference with  their
      rights to respect for family life under the Human Rights Convention.

      Notice of Decision

      The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  involved  the  making  of  an
      error on a point of law. Having set aside the decision, I  re-make  it
      and allow the appellant's appeal.
