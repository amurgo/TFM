Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Kandola, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Mr Rees, Counsel for Raj Law Solicitors, London

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant in these proceedings is the Secretary of  State,  however
    for convenience I shall now refer to the parties as  they  were  before
    the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The Appellants are citizens of Mauritius born on [ ] 1981, [ ] 1972,  [
    ] 2001 and [ ] 2010 respectively.  The First and Second Appellants  are
    the parents of the Third and Fourth Appellants.  The Second, Third  and
    Fourth Appellants are dependants of  the  First  Appellant.   They  are
    appealing against the decisions of the Respondent made on  8th  January
    2015 refusing to grant them leave to remain in the United  Kingdom  and
    the decisions dated 12th January 2014 to remove them  from  the  United
    Kingdom.  The appeals were heard by Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Haria on 14th September 2015.  The appeals were allowed on human rights
    grounds and under the Immigration Rules.  The decision was  promulgated
    on 2nd October 2015.

 3. An application for permission to appeal was lodged and  permission  was
    granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  Parkes  on  25th  February
    2016.  The permission states that the judge allowed the appeals on  the
    basis that it would not be reasonable for the Third Appellant to  leave
    the United Kingdom, having  lived  here  for  over  seven  years.   The
    Appellants did not succeed under the Immigration Rules and the  grounds
    argue that the judge failed  to  consider  the  guidance  cases  of  EV
    (Philippines) and Zoumbas and failed to give  adequate  weight  to  the
    public interest in the enforcement of immigration control.  The  adults
    have a poor immigration history with lengthy overstaying and the use of
    false French documents to  access  services  to  which  they  were  not
    entitled.  The permission states that there is  nothing  unusual  about
    the situation of the child other than the time she  has  spent  in  the
    United Kingdom and if that were enough then the reasonableness  element
    of the Rules would add nothing.   The  permission  states  that  it  is
    arguable  that  the  judge  failed  to  have  regard  to  the   overall
    circumstances and placed too much emphasis on the child compared to the
    other competing interests.

The Hearing

 4. There were no preliminary issues.

 5. The Presenting Officer made his submissions relying on the  grounds  of
    application.  He submitted that binding case law was not applied and no
    good reason was given for not applying this.   The  Presenting  Officer
    referred to the case of EV (Philippines) [2014] EWCA Civ  874  and  the
    case Zoumbas [2013] UKSC 74.  He  submitted  that  the  judge  was  not
    entitled to ignore these cases as these are  binding  authorities  from
    the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court.

 6. I was referred to paragraph 61 of the decision in which the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge  states  that  the  First  Two  Appellants'  immigration
    history  is  poor.   They  have  always  been  in  the  United  Kingdom
    illegally, they used fraudulent documents, they accessed healthcare and
    education free in the United Kingdom at the expense of the taxpayer and
    they worked illegally.  He submitted that when these matters are  taken
    into account and are weighed against  the  public  interest  they  must
    weigh heavily against the Appellants including the eldest child.

 7. He submitted that children without British citizenship cannot expect to
    be educated free in the United Kingdom.  He submitted  that  the  judge
    raised a number of public interest issues and should have dismissed the
    appeals.  He submitted that the judge made a material  misdirection  of
    law by failing to apply these binding cases.

 8. The Presenting Officer submitted that  the  First,  Second  and  Fourth
    Appellants  cannot  succeed  under  the  Immigration  Rules.   He  made
    reference to suitability and submitted that these three Appellants  are
    tagging on to the eldest  child's  claim  under  the  Rules  which  can
    succeed.  He submitted that what the First-tier Tribunal Judge has done
    is find that it is unreasonable for her  to  return  to  Mauritius  and
    because of this none of the  family  members  should  be  returning  to
    Mauritius.  He submitted that what the judge should have done  is  look
    at the family as a whole and not  considered  the  Third  Appellant  in
    isolation.

 9. He submitted that in Mauritius there  is  free  primary  and  secondary
    education on British lines and that the children can both  continue  in
    education in Mauritius.

10. I was asked to find that there is a material error of law in the First-
    tier Tribunal Judge's decision and that it should be set aside and  the
    appeal should be dismissed under the Rules and on human rights grounds.

11. Counsel for the Appellant submitted that he is relying on the  skeleton
    argument on file.

12. He then responded to the submissions made by the Presenting Officer.

13. He submitted that the judge's decision does  not  depart  from  binding
    case law.  He submitted that the judge gave proper consideration to the
    material facts of this case.  The Presenting Officer  stated  that  the
    judge did not properly consider public interest but  Counsel  submitted
    that this statement is just a disagreement with the  decision  made  by
    the judge.  He submitted that there is no  misdirection  of  law.   The
    judge looked at the facts in the round and came to a decision which she
    was entitled to come to.

14. Counsel referred to the said case of  EV  (Philippines)  and  submitted
    that the judge refers to this at paragraphs 48 to 51 of  the  decision.
    He submitted that not only did the judge consider  this  case  he  also
    considered a number of other cases and he submitted that the judge  was
    entitled to reach the decision he did.  He  submitted  that  the  judge
    gave a proper explanation for reaching her decision and I was asked  to
    find that there is no material error of law in the judge's decision.

15. I pointed out that although the judge refers  to  EV  (Philippines)  in
    these paragraphs, she refers to one child in these paragraphs  and  not
    the family as a whole.  Counsel referred to paragraph 51 in  which  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge states that  the  case  of  EV  (Philippines)
    holds that the best interests of the child  are  to  be  determined  by
    reference to the child  alone  without  reference  to  the  immigration
    history or status of either parent and then by determining  whether  or
    not the need for immigration control outweighs the  best  interests  of
    the children.  He submitted that that is what the case states  and  the
    judge has dealt with it in this way.

16. He referred to paragraph 53 of the  decision  and  submitted  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge uses the  guidance  offered  in  the  country
    guidance cases and based on this finds that it would not be  reasonable
    for the Third Appellant to go back to Mauritius,  therefore  the  Third
    Appellant's claim meets the terms of paragraph 276ADE(1).

17. I put to Counsel that the  judge  is  basing  the  claim  on  this  one
    Appellant and the best interests of  the  child  are  not  the  primary
    consideration in this type of case.

18. I referred him to paragraph  36  of  the  decision  which  states  "The
    parents' case rests on the position of Eesha.  If it is not  reasonable
    for her to go back to Mauritius it is not reasonable for them to go and
    nor is it reasonable for Tiana to return to Mauritius."  I put  to  him
    that  the  judge  does  not  appear  to  have  looked  at  the   family
    holistically.

19. The Presenting Officer submitted that the judge should have  looked  at
    the facts as a coherent whole but what she has done  is  describe  what
    has  been  put  to  her  by  the  appellant's  representative  and  has
    misdirected herself in law.

Decision and Reasons

20. Under the heading "Immigration Rules" at paragraph 34 of the  decision,
    the judge states that the issue to be determined in this case  is  what
    is reasonable for Eesha, the Third Appellant and whether  it  would  be
    reasonable for her to leave the United Kingdom.  The judge states  that
    the terms of paragraph 276ADE(1)(iv) can be met by the Third Appellant.
     At paragraph 36 the judge  states  the  parents'  case  rests  on  the
    position of their daughter Eesha.  If it is not reasonable for  her  to
    go back to Mauritius it is not reasonable for them to go back,  nor  is
    it reasonable for Tiana to return to Mauritius.   The  Third  Appellant
    was 3� when she came to the United  Kingdom.   The  Respondent  accepts
    that the First Two Appellants have a genuine marriage.  At paragraph 39
    the judge states that she finds the First Two Appellants to be  honest,
    truthful and credible.  When their immigration  history  is  considered
    this is a strange observation to make.  At paragraph 40 the judge notes
    that education is available in Mauritius, is based on the British model
    and that primary education is free.  The judge notes  that  the  Second
    Appellant's parents and sister live in Mauritius.  The judge notes that
    the Second Appellant's aunt helps them financially.   The  judge  finds
    there is no reason why she cannot continue to do this if they return to
    Mauritius.  The judge then refers to the best interests of the children
    under Section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration  Act  2009
    and refers to the following cases  ZH  (Tanzania)  [2011]  UKSC  4,  MK
    [2011] UKUT 00475 (IAC), and at paragraphs 48 to 51 refers to the  said
    case of EV (Philippines) and others.  She quotes this case relating  to
    what factors have to be considered when the best interests of  children
    are considered.  In particular she deals with the length  of  time  the
    child or children have been in the United Kingdom but then at paragraph
    50 she refers to paragraph 60 of EV (Philippines).  This states:

         "In our case none of the family is a British citizen.  None has the
         right to remain in this country.  If  the  mother  is  removed  the
         father has no independent right to  remain.   If  the  parents  are
         removed then it is entirely reasonable to expect the children to go
         with them - it is obviously in their best interests to remain  with
         their parents.  Although it is of course a question of fact for the
         Tribunal I cannot see that the desirability of  being  educated  at
         public expense in the UK can outweigh the benefit to  the  children
         of remaining with their parents.  Just as we cannot provide medical
         treatment for the world so we cannot educate the world."

    The judge goes on to the case of Azimi-Moayed and  others  [2013]  UKUT
    197 (IAC). At paragraph 52 she accepts that the best interests  of  the
    children is to remain with their parents.  The judge then  states,  "On
    my assessment of the evidence it would not be reasonable for  Eesha  to
    go back to Mauritius, it is in her best interests to remain in the  UK.
    She meets the requirements of paragraph 276ADE(1)(iv)".   In  spite  of
    quoting paragraph 60 above from the case of EV (Philippines) the  judge
    goes on to ignore this.  EV (Philippines) goes on to state at paragraph
    61:

         "In fact the Immigration Judge weighed the best  interests  of  the
         children as a primary consideration and set against it the economic
         well-being of the country.   It  would  have  been  appropriate  to
         consider the cost to the public purse  in  providing  education  to
         these children.  The Immigration  Judge  adopted  an  approach  too
         favourable to the appellant."

21. In our case the judge makes reference  to  the  First  Two  Appellants'
    chequered history having been in the United Kingdom illegally  for  the
    whole time they have been here, the fact that the whole family has  had
    access to employment, free healthcare and free education and she refers
    to the First and Second Appellants working when they had no right to do
    so.   At paragraph 61 she makes an issue of  all  these  matters.   She
    refers to huge damage to the economy of the United Kingdom.  She refers
    to the adults using false documents.  She  then  states  that  none  of
    Eesha's time in the United Kingdom without the relevant visa is through
    her fault and that is correct.  At  paragraph  63  she  refers  to  the
    maintenance of immigration control  being  necessary  to  preserve  and
    foster the economic wellbeing of the country and to protect the  health
    and morals and for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.
     In spite of making these findings the judge finds  in  favour  of  the
    Appellants.

22. The case of Zoumbas states that it is in the children's best  interests
    to go with their parents to the Republic of Congo.   It  is  stated  in
    that case that it was in the best interests of the children  that  they
    and their parents stayed in the  United  Kingdom  so  that  they  could
    obtain such benefits as healthcare and education  which  the  decision-
    maker recognised might be of a higher standard than would be  available
    in the Congo but other things were not equal,  they  were  not  British
    citizens, they had no right to future education and healthcare  in  the
    United Kingdom, they were part  of  a  close-knit  family  with  highly
    educated parents and were of an age when their  emotional  needs  could
    only met within the immediate family unit.  Zoumbas goes  on  to  state
    that the decision-maker concluded that the children could be removed to
    the Republic of Congo in the care  of  their  parents  without  serious
    detriment to their wellbeing.

23. At paragraph 58 of First-tier Tribunal Judge Haria's decision the judge
    states that she has taken into account the factors set out in  Sections
    117A and 117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, Part
    5A.  Although she sets out the terms of these  sections  she  does  not
    apply them.  Her whole decision is based on  the  claim  of  the  Third
    Appellant.  She has not considered this family as a whole.  She has not
    considered the cost to the United Kingdom of them being here  for  over
    seven years  illegally  and  accessing  healthcare  and  education  and
    working  illegally.   She  has   not   carried   out   a   satisfactory
    proportionality assessment.

24. With regard to human rights it is clear  that  the  judge  has  made  a
    material misdirection of law and has failed to give adequate weight  to
    public interest and the requirement of effective immigration control in
    the United Kingdom.  The case of EA (Nigeria) states that  a  right  to
    education is too narrow a scope to be of assistance when assessing  the
    best interests of the child.  To  conduct  such  an  analysis  entirely
    through the prism of education would be a material misdirection.   This
    is exactly what the judge has done in this case.

25. The law states that the best interests of the child must be  a  primary
    consideration but in this case the judge has taken it  as  the  primary
    consideration.  Factors that need  to  be  included  in  the  balancing
    exercise are not limited to the overstaying of the children  and  their
    parents.   What  has  to  be  considered  is  whether   it   would   be
    inappropriate for the  cost  and  duration  of  the  Third  and  Fourth
    Appellants' education and care in this country, to be reasonable.

26. The best interests of the children  have  to  be  weighed  against  the
    immigration history of the family.  The facts of the case are that  the
    family has been in the United Kingdom illegally  for  more  than  seven
    years and has stayed here  against  public  interest  and  against  the
    necessity for effective  immigration  control.   They  have  family  in
    Mauritius who can assist them on return.  There  is  a  good  education
    system in Mauritius that can be used by the children.   The  First  and
    Second Appellants have work experience in the United Kingdom that  will
    help them to get work when they return to Mauritius.

27. The judge has not used the reasonability test correctly.  The hardships
    raised are largely analogous with  the  ordinary  challenges  a  couple
    would face in relocating.  The rights of the minor Appellants, relating
    to their education, have to be considered based on the case law  quoted
    and it is clear that the judge has not properly  applied  the  relevant
    case law.   There are therefore material errors of law in  the  judge's
    decision.

Notice of Decision

28. There are material errors of law in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge's
    decision.  This decision must be set aside.

29. Had the judge correctly applied the  relevant  case  law  her  decision
    would have been different.

30. The terms of the Immigration Rules can only be met by Appellant  number
    3 and her appeal can be allowed under the Immigration  Rules  but  when
    this family is considered as a whole their appeals must be dismissed on
    human rights grounds and under the Immigration Rules.

31. Anonymity has been directed.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs otherwise, the  Appellants  are
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify them or any member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellants and to the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
