                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal  (Judge  Rodger  sitting  at  Taylor  House  on  30
    September 2016) dismissing her appeal against the decision of an  Entry
    Clearance Officer to refuse her entry clearance  for  the  purposes  of
    settlement as a child, under the age of 18, of  a  person  present  and
    settled here.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  make  an  anonymity
    direction, and I do not consider that the appellant requires  anonymity
    for these proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

The Reasons for Granting Permission to Appeal

 2. On 20 March 2017 First -tier Tribunal Judge Baker granted the appellant
    permission to appeal as it was arguable, in the light  of  the  finding
    that the appellant's father had died some  time  previously,  that  the
    Judge may have inadvertently erred in not considering  the  application
    of Rule 297(i)(d).

Relevant Background Facts

 3. The appellant is a national of Zimbabwe, whose date of birth is 8 April
    1997.  Just before her 18th birthday, she applied for  entry  clearance
    to join her mother in the UK.

 4. On 1 April 2015 an Entry Clearance Officer in Pretoria (post reference:
    Pretoria\1203498) gave his reasons  for  refusing  her  application  by
    reference to Rule 297.  He acknowledged that she had  stated  that  her
    father was deceased, and that she had submitted a death certificate  to
    substantiate this.  The death certificate showed  that  he  had  passed
    away in March 2003.

 5. She said that her mother had left Zimbabwe and travelled to the  UK  on
    28 August 2001.  She had therefore  resided  in  Zimbabwe  without  her
    parents for the last 12 years.  She had not submitted evidence to  show
    that she had maintained contact with her mother, nor had she  submitted
    evidence  to  show  that  her  mother  had  been   financially   and/or
    emotionally responsible for her since her birth.  She  attended  school
    in Zimbabwe and she apparently had close family in Zimbabwe to whom she
    could turn for support.   She  did  not  appear  to  have  any  medical
    concerns.  He was not  therefore  satisfied  that  she  was  living  in
    compelling and compassionate circumstances.

 6. In her VAF, she stated that her sponsor  was  registered  blind  on  19
    January 2012, and she did not work in the UK.  The documents  that  she
    submitted showed that her sponsor was in receipt of public funds.   She
    said that she wanted to join her sponsor in the UK so  that  she  could
    improve her  quality  of  life  and  assist  her  with  her  day-to-day
    activities.  So she wanted to relocate to the UK in order to  care  for
    her sponsor, rather than  out  of  necessity  due  to  her  own  living
    conditions in Zimbabwe.

 7. In consequence of the above considerations, the appellant did not  meet
    the requirement of Rule 297(i)(f).

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 8. Both parties were legally represented before Judge Rodger.  Mr  Muzenda
    appeared on behalf of the appellant. In her subsequent decision,  Judge
    Roger gave very detailed and comprehensive reasons  for  the  following
    findings with reference to Rule 297:

     a) She was not satisfied that the sponsor had had  sole  responsibility
        for the appellant's upbringing;

     b) She found that the appellant had been brought up  by  her  aunt  and
        older sister, and  that  her  mother  had  not  made  the  important
        decisions in her life;

     c) She was not satisfied  that  there  were  serious  family  or  other
        considerations which made her exclusion from the UK undesirable;

     d) She did not accept that the appellant's aunt was intending  to  move
        away and that the appellant would be left alone in Zimbabwe;

     e) It was in the appellant's best interests to remain in Zimbabwe,  the
        country of which she was a national and where she had grown  up  and
        been educated.

 9. With regard to an alternative  Article  8  claim,  the  Judge  held  as
    follows, at paragraph [43]:

        No application was made until 2015 and I am not satisfied  that  the
        relationship between them is  close  as  suggested,  and  I  am  not
        satisfied that it is  likely  that  the  application  was  made  for
        purposes other than for the appellant  to  come  and  care  for  the
        sponsor.  While this may be a natural desire of a child to care  for
        a parent, I am not satisfied that this is a compelling reason to not
        apply the Immigration Rules and grant leave outside the Rules as the
        sponsor's care needs are currently being met by the  state  and  her
        needs are not unmet.  Therefore, whilst the refusal  decision  as  a
        result of the appellant not being able to come and join  her  mother
        in the  UK,  I  am  satisfied  that  the  decision  was  lawful  and
        proportionate  to  the  legitimate  aim  of  maintaining   effective
        Immigration control.  Whilst it may be said that  the  provision  of
        care by the appellant could reduce the amount of care needed  to  be
        provided by the state, I am not satisfied that  this  is  sufficient
        either on its own or on a cumulative basis  for  the  other  factors
        relied  upon  by  the  appellant  to  render  the  refusal  decision
        disproportionate, it does not take into account that  the  appellant
        would be likely to use educational facilities and may use  the  NHS,
        such that it cannot be proved that she will not seek the benefits of
        being a resident in the UK and will not be a  burden  on  the  state
        resources.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

10. At the hearing before me to determine whether an error of law was  made
    out, Mr Bramble conceded that the Judge had materially erred in law  in
    not considering the  application  of  Rule  297(i)(d).   After  further
    discussion, I accepted Mr Bramble's concession, and held that an  error
    of law was made out.  My reasons for so finding are set out below.

11. For the purposes of re-making the decision, I sought clarification from
    the sponsor as to her financial means and hence her ability to maintain
    and accommodate her daughter in the United Kingdom  without  additional
    recourse to public funds.  Mr Bramble declined to question the  sponsor
    on this topic.

12. In his closing submissions on behalf of the Entry Clearance Officer  on
    the topic of re-making, Mr Bramble said it was open to me to find  that
    all the relevant requirements of Rule 297 were met.  Mr Muzenda invited
    me to make this finding in the appellant's favour, and  accordingly  to
    allow her appeal.

Reasons for Finding an Error of Law

13. Rule 297 provides that the requirements to be met by a  person  seeking
    indefinite leave to enter the United Kingdom as the child of a  parent,
    parents or a relative  present  and  settled,  or  being  admitted  for
    settlement into the United Kingdom, are that he:

         (i) is seeking leave to  enter  to  accompany  or  join  a  parent,
         parents or a relative in one of the following circumstances:

              ...

             (d) one parent is present and settled in the United Kingdom or
             being admitted on the same occasion  for  settlement  and  the
             other parent is dead (my emphasis); or

             (e) one parent is settled  in  the  United  Kingdom  or  being
             admitted on the same occasion for settlement and has had  sole
             responsibility for the child's upbringing; or

             (f) one parent or a relative is present  and  settled  in  the
             United Kingdom or being admitted  on  the  same  occasion  for
             settlement and there are  serious  and  compelling  family  or
             other  considerations  which  make  exclusion  of  the   child
             undesirable and suitable arrangements have been made  for  the
             child's care; and

         (ii) is under the age of 18; and

         (iii) is not leading an independent life, is unmarried and is not a
         civil partner, and is not from an independent family unit; and

         (iv) can, and will,  be  accommodated  adequately  by  the  parent,
         parents or relative the child is seeking to join  without  recourse
         to public funds in  accommodation  which  the  parent,  parents  or
         relative  of  the  child  is  seeking  to  join,  own   or   occupy
         exclusively; and

         (v) can, and will be maintained adequately by the  parent,  parents
         or relative of the child is seeking to join,  without  recourse  to
         public funds; and

         (vi) holds a valid United Kingdom entry clearance for entry in this
         capacity; and

         (viii) does not fall for refusal under the general grounds for  the
         refusal.

14. The Judge  gave  more  than  adequate  reasons  for  finding  that  the
    appellant  did  not   satisfy   the   gateway   requirement   of   sole
    responsibility or the gateway requirement of there  being  serious  and
    compelling family or other  considerations  which  made  her  exclusion
    undesirable.  However, she failed to address the  question  of  whether
    the appellant qualified for entry clearance on the  simple  basis  that
    her father was dead.

15. Mr Bramble's colleague, who  settled  the  Rule  24  response,  queried
    whether this point had been relied  on  at  the  hearing  before  Judge
    Rodger.  Having reviewed the papers, I am not satisfied that the matter
    was specifically drawn to the Judge's attention.  It appears to me that
    the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal proceeded on the  ground  of
    battle chosen by the Entry Clearance Officer, which was to focus on the
    appellant's asserted inability to  satisfy  sub-paragraph  (f),  rather
    than addressing the consequences of her apparent ability to satisfy the
    alternative gateway requirement set out in sub-paragraph  (d).

16. However, the law always speaks. So Mr Muzenda's failure  to  advance  a
    clear case under sub-paragraph (d) before the First-tier Tribunal Judge
    is not determinative of the outcome of the error of law  challenge.   A
    material error of law is made out as the Judge  has  not  addressed  an
    alternative ground, which is mentioned  in  the  refusal  decision,  on
    which the appellant can qualify for entry clearance under Rule 297.

Discussion and Findings on Re-making

17. It is accepted in the refusal decision that the appellant's  father  is
    dead.  Accordingly, the appellant is able to bring herself within  Rule
    297(i)(d) as her mother is present and settled in the  United  Kingdom,
    and "the other parent is dead".  It appears to be the view of the Entry
    Clearance Officer who refused the application that  the  death  of  the
    father was not the reason why the appellant was seeking entry clearance
    just before her  18th  birthday,  which  is  probably  true,  and  that
    therefore his death was irrelevant to the question of  the  appellant's
    ability to bring herself  within  the  scope  of  Rule  297.   But  the
    appellant was not required to justify her  motivation.   All  that  the
    Rule requires is that one of the set of circumstances set out  in  sub-
    paragraph (i) applies.  The appellant  was  applying  in  circumstances
    where one parent was settled in the UK, and the other parent was  dead.
    That was all that the appellant needed to prove.

18. The Entry Clearance Officer did not put  in  issue  any  of  the  other
    requirements of Rule 297.  In particular, the Entry  Clearance  Officer
    did not raise any concern about the sponsor's ability to  maintain  and
    accommodate the appellant adequately without recourse to public  funds.
    As the sponsor is reliant on public funds for her own  maintenance  and
    accommodation, what is in effect required is that there  should  be  no
    additional recourse to public funds.

19. I note that Judge Rodger did not find the  sponsor  to  be  a  reliable
    witness on various matters which were canvassed  with  her  during  the
    hearing.  In addition, I have not been provided with a breakdown of the
    sponsor's income and expenditure, or underlying documents such as  bank
    statements which evidence the sponsor's asserted level of  savings  and
    current income.

20. However, it is reasonable to infer  that  she  provided  the  necessary
    documentary evidence to satisfy the Entry Clearance  Officer  on  these
    matters, as otherwise I would have expected the Entry Clearance Officer
    to have raised the  issue  of  funding  as  an  additional  reason  for
    refusing the application.  Moreover,  the  sponsor  gave  credible  and
    unchallenged oral evidence that: (a) she lives in a council flat  which
    is paid for by the council; (b) there is sufficient room  in  the  one-
    bedroomed flat to accommodate her daughter as well as herself,  without
    her daughter having to pay an additional amount for her occupancy;  (c)
    she has savings of about �6,000; and (d) she  is  receiving  Disability
    Allowance amounting to �450 a month, and Employment  Support  Allowance
    amounting to �372 paid every two weeks.

21. I further note that, when considering proportionality, Judge Rodger did
    not make a finding that there was a risk of  the  appellant  having  to
    access  state  benefits  in  order  to   fund   her   maintenance   and
    accommodation.  Judge Rodger's concern related to  the  wider  economic
    impact of the appellant's presence in the UK, namely her accessing  the
    NHS or free education provided by the state.  But this does  not  count
    as having recourse to public funds for the purposes of the Rules.

22. In conclusion, I am satisfied that all  the  relevant  requirements  of
    Rule 297 are met, and that therefore the appeal should be allowed.
