                            DECISION AND REASONS
                    (Delivered orally on 30 August 2016)

Introduction

 1. The appellant is a national of DRC born 10 October 1935.  She  appealed
    against an Entry Clearance Officer's  decision  of  18  September  2014
    refusing her application for an EEA family permit to enter  the  United
    Kingdom as the dependent adult mother of Mrs  Winter  (the  appellant's
    daughter) and Mrs Winter's husband, who is a German national exercising
    treaty rights in the  United  Kingdom.   The  Entry  Clearance  Officer
    refused entry clearance  ostensibly  for  two  reasons:  (i)  that  the
    appellant was not related as claimed to the UK sponsors; and, (ii)  the
    appellant had not demonstrated that she is financially dependent on the
    EEA national sponsor.

    First-tier Tribunal's decision

 2. As to the first of these reasons, this was resolved by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal in the appellant's favour as a consequence of the provision of
    the DNA evidence proving the relevant relationship.

 3. It is the FtT's conclusion relating to the second  issue  that  is  the
    subject of challenge before the Upper Tribunal. The  FtT  concluded  as
    follows in paragraphs 12 and 13 of its decision:

         "12. More problematic is  the  issue  of  dependency,  which  is  a
             question  of  fact.   Mrs  Winter  frankly  stated  that   the
             appellant has a number of close relatives living  in  Kinshasa
             or in DRC, including two married daughters, two nieces  and  a
             nephew.  In his witness statement Mr Thierry Ngolo Kitata (the
             nephew) stated that he and his siblings were in employment and
             were self-sufficient.  While there  was  independent  evidence
             that money is sent by Mrs Winter regularly to her mother,  the
             amount (said to average ï¿½100 per month) is very modest and was
             by no means shown to cover all of her mother's  living  costs.
             No breakdown was provided of the appellant's outgoings.  There
             was no independent evidence of living costs in Kinshasa, which
             it was for the appellant to provide.  There is no  reason  for
             the Tribunal to infer that Kinshasa is a notably  cheap  place
             to live.  Mrs Winter's claim that the cost of living is low in
             Kinshasa is obviously by reference to the United  Kingdom  and
             was not independent.  Mrs Winter has not been to Kinshasa  for
             many years.

         13.  It was declared that accommodation is provided by  another  of
             the appellant's daughters, Khomi.  On  any  view,  that  is  a
             substantial contribution to the appellant's living costs, i.e.
             her essential needs.  As there was  no  categorical  assertion
             that no other of the appellant's  relatives  (apart  from  Mrs
             Winter and Khomi) make no contribution at all to her upkeep in
             any way, the Tribunal infers that  those  other  relatives  do
             contribute, according to their means, as  is  normal  practice
             where family members are on good terms and a person such as an
             elderly parent is unable to work.  The family live much closer
             to the appellant than Mr and Mrs Winter or Khomi.   There  was
             no suggestion that the family is poor.  On the  contrary,  the
             appellant's late husband was said to have been a nurse and the
             nephew holds a  government  post.   No  bank  statements  were
             produced for the  appellant.   The  Tribunal  is  prepared  to
             accept that Mrs Winter and Khomi contribute  more  than  their
             local siblings and the nieces and nephews.  The Tribunal finds
             that Mrs Winter in effect tops up what is contributed by other
             relatives such as Khomi and the local  family.   The  Tribunal
             finds that it has not been proved that the appellant is mainly
             dependent on Mr and Mrs Winter."



Grounds of Challenge

 4. The grounds of challenge can be summarised thus:

 i) The FtT misdirected  itself  as  to  the  evidence  when  stating  that
    "...there was no categorical assertion that no other of the appellant's
    relatives (apart from Mrs Winter and Khomi) make no contribution at all
    to her upkeep in any way...";

ii) Alternatively, if the evidence that was  given  on  the  aforementioned
    issue was rejected by the FtT it, nevertheless,  erred  in  failing  to
    give any reasons for such conclusion;

iii) The FtT erred in misdirecting itself as to meaning of 'dependency';

iv) The FtT's conclusion on the issue of dependency is irrational.

    Discussion and Decision - Error of Law

 5. During the course of the hearing before the Upper Tribunal I was  taken
    to three witness statements produced respectively  by  the  appellant's
    daughter, her husband and the sponsor's nephew, Mr Kitata.  In each  of
    those witness statements evidence is clearly given to the  effect  that
    no other financial  contribution  is  made  to  the  appellant  by  the
    appellant's family members other than by the UK sponsors (save for from
    Khomi who provides the appellant's accommodation).

 6. In particular, the appellant's daughter confirms that the appellant has
    "no other source of income", other than that provided by  her  and  her
    husband.  Mr Winter confirms the same at paragraph  1  of  his  witness
    statement and Mr Kitata, in paragraph 3 of  his  statement,  identifies
    that it is not the case that family members other than the UK  sponsors
    support the appellant.

 7. In addition to the clear evidence given in written form, the FtT  heard
    oral evidence in the same  vein.   This  evidence  is  recited  in  the
    appellant's grounds of appeal and,  although  those  grounds  were  not
    accompanied by a copy of the  contemporaneous  note  of  hearing  or  a
    witness statement, that recitation accords directly with the First-tier
    Tribunal's Record of Proceedings which reads as follows, in relation to
    exchange with the appellant's daughter:

         "Question:    Do any of your  other  family  members  provide  your
                    mother with other financial support?

         Answer:  I am the main provider.

         Question:     Do any of your other sisters  or  nieces  or  nephews
                    provide her with money?

         Answer:  No because I am the one who provides for her."

 8. In my conclusion, and as was accepted by Ms  Brocklesby-Weller  at  the
    hearing, the evidence identified  above  is  not  consistent  with  the
    conclusion of the First-tier Tribunal - found in paragraph  13  of  its
    decision - that "...there was no categorical assertion that no other of
    the appellant's relatives (apart from Mrs Winter  and  Khomi)  make  no
    contribution at all to her upkeep in any way...".

 9. As such, and again  as  Ms  Brocklesby-Weller  properly  accepted,  the
    lawfulness of the First-tier Tribunal's decision  is  undermined  by  a
    misdirection as to the evidence before  it.  That  misdirection  is  so
    fundamental so as to require the First-tier Tribunal's decision  to  be
    set aside.

10. I also observe, although this was not a matter upon  which  submissions
    were made at the hearing, that the First-tier Tribunal further  clearly
    failed to lawfully direct itself as to the approach to  be  taken  when
    determining whether a situation of dependency exists.  The question  to
    be asked by the First-tier Tribunal was not whether the  appellant  was
    mainly dependent on Mr and Mrs Winter, but whether the funds sent by Mr
    and Mrs Winter were necessary in order for the appellant  to  meet  her
    essential needs in DRC (see the decision of  the  Court  of  Appeal  in
    Bigia [2009] EWCA Civ 79).

11. For these reasons, I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.



Re-making of Decision

12. Both parties agreed that the Upper Tribunal should remake the decision,
    and could do so on the available evidence.

13. The only issue is that of dependency.  The evidence on this  issue,  as
    Ms Brocklesby-Weller accepted, falls only one way and that is in favour
    of the appellant.  There is no rejection of the witnesses' evidence  by
    the First-tier Tribunal, indeed the  main  witness'  evidence  was  not
    challenged during the course  of  the  hearing  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal. As such I take that evidence at face value.

14.  On the accepted evidence it is clear that for the purposes of the 2006
    EEA Regulations the appellant  is  dependent  on  Mr  and  Mrs  Winter.
    Consequently, that being the only issue left for determination  in  the
    appeal and that being an issue upon which I  find  in  the  appellant's
    favour, I allow the appellant's appeal on the basis that she meets  the
    requirements of regulation 7 and 12 the 2006 EEA Regulations.

Notice of Decision

For the reasons given above,  the  First-tier  Tribunal's  decision  is  set
aside.

The decision  under  appeal  is  remade  by  the  Upper  Tribunal,  and  the
appellant's appeal is allowed.
