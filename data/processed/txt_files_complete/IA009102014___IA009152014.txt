                                                                 Respondents


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Miss Johnstone, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondents:   Dr Thorndike, instructed by Ryan Adams, Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The respondents, Sikandar Bashir  and  Aqfa  Bashir,  are  citizens  of
    Pakistan.  They are husband and wife.  The  second  respondent  is  the
    dependant on the appeal of the first respondent  who  applied  in  June
    2013 for further leave to remain in the United  Kingdom  as  a  Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur) Migrant.  His application  was  refused  on  3  December
    2013.  I shall hereafter refer to the appellant as the  respondent  and
    to the respondents as the appellants,  as  they  appeared  respectively
    before the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The appellants appeal to the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  PJG  White)
    which, in a determination which was promulgated on 9 May 2014,  allowed
    the appeals under the Immigration Rules.  The Secretary  of  State  now
    appeals, with permission, to the Upper Tribunal.

 3. Permission was initially refused in the First-tier Tribunal because the
    application for permission was made out of time.  Judge  Goldstein,  in
    the Upper Tribunal, extended time and granted  permission.   I  am  not
    persuaded that I have any jurisdiction to interfere with that decision.
     The point was not pressed  by  Dr  Thorndike,  who  appeared  for  the
    appellants before the Upper Tribunal at Manchester, and I shall make no
    further reference to it.

 4. The first appellant's appeal foundered because the Secretary  of  State
    decided that he did not satisfy the genuineness test  contained  within
    paragraph 245DD(h)(i):


         (h) Except where the applicant has, or was last granted, leave as a
         Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant, a Businessperson or an Innovator and
         is being assessed under Table 5 of
         Appendix A, the Secretary of State must be satisfied that:


             (i) the applicant genuinely:


                  (1) intends and is able to establish, take over or become
                  a director of one or more businesses in the UK within the
                  next six months, or


                  (2) has established, taken over or become a director of
                  one or more businesses in the UK and continues to operate
                  that business or businesses; and


             (ii) the applicant genuinely intends to invest the money
             referred to in Table 4 of Appendix A in the business or
             businesses referred to in (i);


             (iii) the money referred to in Table 4 of Appendix A is
             genuinely available to the applicant, and will remain
             available to him until such time as it is spent for the
             purposes of his business or businesses.


             (iv) that the applicant does not intend to take employment in
             the United Kingdom other than under the terms of paragraph
             245DE.

 5. The refusal letters quotes at length from an interview carried  out  by
    the respondent's officers with the first appellant.  The  Secretary  of
    State was not satisfied that the appellant was a  genuine  entrepreneur
    applicant.   It  was  noted,  inter  alia,  that  he  had  only  placed
    advertisements for his new business in newspapers three days before  he
    had made his  application  for  further  leave  to  remain  whilst  his
    business plan appeared to be "speculative" and  was  not  supported  by
    market research; the appellant only  had  one  contract  and  had  made
    little effort to enter additional contracts; the appellant  had  worked
    as a store manager and, although he had a qualification in  information
    systems management, his work experience did not appear relevant to  the
    business which he intended to pursue.

 6. In short, Judge White accepted the explanations the appellant  gave  in
    his written and oral evidence for these concerns of  the  Secretary  of
    State.  He acknowledged that the appellant's business plans were likely
    to be "somewhat speculative" [22]; he  accepted  that  the  appellant's
    experience as a store manager would give him an insight into the  needs
    of customers "from the other side of the counter"; he accepted that the
    appellant's  business  activities  were  likely  to  be  restricted  by
    uncertainties over his leave to remain whilst he was not in a  position
    to enter into long term contracts which might not be  completed  should
    he be required to leave the United Kingdom.  As regards the funding  of
    the business, the judge observed [26] that the respondent had taken:

         no issue concerning the adequacy of the letter from Habib Bank  Ltd
         dated 21 June 2013 who indicates that the first appellant  has  the
         equivalent of more than ï¿½50,000 in his Pakistani bank account  that
         is disposable/transferrable in the United Kingdom.

 7. Dealing with the funding issue first, it is the case that  the  grounds
    of appeal do not take issue with the  judge's  findings.   The  grounds
    criticise the judge for having found that the appellant was restricting
    his business activities because he (wrongly) believed that he could not
    work after awaiting the outcome of his application for further leave to
    remain and the instant appeal.  In the light of the Tribunal's decision
    in Ahmed and Another (PBS: admissible level) [2014]  UKUT  00365  (IAC)
    the Secretary of State now accepts that at [25]  of  the  determination
    the judge did not (as the grounds of appeal assert at [6]) err  in  law
    in his interpretation  of  the  restriction  on  the  admissibility  of
    documentary evidence in the appeal.

 8. As regards the remaining grounds, it may well  be  the  case  that  the
    appellant was wrong to believe that  he  might  commit  an  immigration
    defence by working pending the determination of his  appeal.   However,
    my reading of the decision is that Judge White found that the appellant
    himself genuinely believed (whether or not he was right to do so)  that
    he could not press ahead with his  business  until  such  time  as  the
    matter of his leave to remain had been settled.   The  judge  does  not
    offer his own opinion on the law and does no more than to find that the
    appellant has demonstrated  bona  fides  by  restricting  his  business
    activities in order to avoid the possibility of acting illegally; it is
    not of importance whether he was or was not able to work, only that  he
    genuinely believed that he could not  do  so.   In  the  light  of  the
    judge's finding,  the  rejection  of  the  appellant's  application  on
    "genuineness" grounds cannot be sustained; any lack of progress in  the
    appellant's business was  the  result  of  a  genuine  mistake  on  the
    appellant's behalf and did not occur  because  his  application  as  an
    entrepreneur is not genuine.

 9. I find that Judge White has written  a  sound  determination  which  is
    supported by adequate reasoning and which is not flawed by any error of
    law either as asserted in grounds or at all.  The Secretary of  State's
    appeal is dismissed.
