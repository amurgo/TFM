Representation:

For the Appellant:     Miss K Smith instructed by Paragon Law
For the Respondent:    Mr A McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Ghana who entered the United Kingdom as a
    visitor of 9th February 2013.  On 18th July 2013 he applied for further
    leave to remain in the United Kingdom but his application  was  refused
    by the Respondent on 13th  September  2013.   An  appeal  against  that
    refusal was allowed by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  Nixon  on  9th
    April 2014.  The First-tier Judge found that  the  Appellant  satisfied
    the requirements of the Immigration Rules and that the  Respondent  had
    also failed to  apply  Section  55  of  the  Borders,  Citizenship  and
    Immigration Act 2009.

 2. The Respondent's representative applied for permission  to  appeal  and
    permission was granted in the First-tier Tribunal  on  15th  May  2014.
    The judge who granted permission noted that the appeal was  allowed  by
    reference to paragraph EX.1 of Appendix FM.  The First-tier Judge found
    that the Appellant was entitled to rely on EX.1 despite his failure  to
    meet the requirements of E-LTRP.2.1 or 2.2.  It was considered arguable
    that the First-tier Judge misdirected herself  in  law  in  failing  to
    follow Sabir (Appendix FM - EX.1 not freestanding)  [2014]  UKUT  00063
    (IAC).

 3. The factual background to  this  appeal  is  conveniently  set  out  at
    paragraph 6 of the First-tier Tribunal's determination.  The  Appellant
    and his wife, who has indefinite leave to remain, married in  Ghana  on
    3rd April 2010.  Mrs Yawson remained in Ghana until February 2011, when
    she returned to the UK for six weeks to seek  medical  attention.   She
    discovered that she was pregnant in May 2011 and returned to the UK  in
    September 2011.  Their first child, a  British  citizen,  was  born  in
    January 2012.  The Appellant came to the UK in February 2013, in  order
    to  assist  his  wife  with  childcare  having  regard  to  her  health
    difficulties.  They discovered that Mrs Yawson was  pregnant  again  in
    May 2013 and accordingly the Appellant made an application for  further
    leave in order to assist her.

 4. The determination further records that the Appellant stated that he had
    not applied to come to the UK as a partner as he had  not  intended  to
    remain in the UK, no decision having been made as to where he  and  his
    wife would ultimately live.  He stated that  if,  after  his  wife  had
    recovered from her first pregnancy, they decided to settle in  the  UK,
    he would return to Ghana and make the appropriate application but  they
    had not anticipated that she would fall pregnant a second time.

 5. In submissions before me, Mr McVeety adopted the grounds  submitted  in
    support of the application for permission to appeal.  The grounds argue
    that the First-tier Judge made a material error in law in allowing  the
    appeal on the basis of EX.1 of Appendix FM.  The First-tier Judge noted
    (paragraph 14) that the Appellant was within the UK as a  visitor.   It
    was conceded on behalf of the Appellant that  he  could  not  meet  the
    eligibility requirements of Appendix FM, specifically  E-LTRPT3.1.   In
    applying EX.1 the grounds submit  that  the  First-tier  Judge  made  a
    material  error  of  law  because  the  provisions  of  EX.1  are   not
    freestanding as established in Sabir.

 6. In his oral submissions, Mr McVeety pointed out that there was no cross
    appeal on behalf of the Appellant.  He also made reference to paragraph
    16 of the determination and submitted that it is not for the First-tier
    Judge to interpret  the  Rules  or  to  speculate  as  to  Parliament's
    intention.  Mr McVeety submitted that this appeal was  "on  all  fours"
    with Sabir and that, as  a  reported  Upper  Tribunal  decision,  Sabir
    should be followed.

 7. For the Appellant, Miss Smith relied upon a Rule 24 response which  had
    been drafted by her colleague who represented the Appellant before  the
    First-tier Tribunal.  She  submitted  that  the  First-tier  Judge  had
    allowed the appeal on a different basis to the decision in Sabir.   She
    submitted that paragraph EX.1 must apply to E-LTRPT.3.1 as well  as  E-
    LTRPT.3.2.

 8. Miss Smith pointed out that the  First-tier  Judge  had  addressed  the
    decision in Sabir and that the determination disclosed no error of law.

 9. After hearing submissions on the error  of  law  issue  I  reserved  my
    decision which I now give.

10. There appears to be no  dispute  of  any  significance  concerning  the
    factual  background  to  this  appeal.   The  issue  relates   to   the
    application of EX.1.

11. I have looked carefully at the immigration  status  requirements  which
    are as follows:

    E-LTRP.2.1 - The applicant must not be in the UK -

      a) as a visitor;

      b) with valid leave granted for a period of six months or less, unless
         that leave is a fiancï¿½ or proposed civil partner,  or  was  granted
         pending the outcome of Family Court or divorce proceedings; or

      c) on temporary admission or temporary release (unless paragraph EX.1.
         applies).

    E-LTRP.2.2 - The  applicant  must  not  be  in  the  UK  in  breach  of
    immigration laws (disregarding any period of overstaying for  a  period
    of 28 days or less), unless paragraph EX.1. applies.

12. The question appears to be does EX.1 apply to  2.2  but  only  to  sub-
    paragraph (c) of 2.1, or to all three elements  of  2.1?   If  it  only
    applies to  sub-paragraph  (c)  then  one  is  left  with  a  potential
    situation where an overstayer, or illegal entrant, could be in a better
    position under the Rules than someone who is lawfully in the  UK  as  a
    visitor.  This is addressed by the First-tier Judge at paragraph 16  of
    her determination.  Perhaps the use of the word "nonsense" is a  little
    strong but it is difficult to disagree with the sentiment expressed.

13. It is clear from the determination that Judge Nixon was referred to the
    decision in Sabir by both representatives and that  she  took  it  into
    account.  In my view, this is not a case where  she  has  attempted  to
    apply  EX.1  as  a  freestanding  provision,  contrary  to  the   Upper
    Tribunal's guidance in Sabir.

14. Having given the matter careful thought, I have concluded that I am  in
    agreement with Miss Smith's submission.  I find that the making of  the
    decision by the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the  making  of  an
    error on a point of law.  I  therefore  uphold  the  determination  and
    dismiss the Respondent's appeal.

No anonymity direction is made.
