               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                   Appellant

                                 PAWAN KUMAR
                                                                  Respondent


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The respondent, whom I shall call 'the claimant', appealed to the First-
    tier Tribunal against the decision of the respondent refusing to  issue
    him with  a  Residence  Card.   Judge  Fox  allowed  the  appeal.   The
    Secretary of State thereupon sought, and  was  granted,  permission  to
    appeal to this Tribunal.  The grounds  are  that  the  judge  erred  in
    considering he was bound to accept the claimant's version of events  in
    the absence of cross-examination, despite noting that it was  difficult
    to see that the marriage between him and his  wife  had  any  substance
    because they had no common language.

 2. Following the grant  of  permission,  the  claimant  has,  through  his
    solicitor, sought to withdraw his case.

 3. I allow the withdrawal.  In the circumstances it is apparent that there
    is no resistance to the Secretary of State's appeal and  this  case  is
    suitable  for  determination  without  a  hearing.   The  grounds  have
    substance.  The facts tend to show  that  the  marriage  was  or  is  a
    marriage of convenience and the claimant (on whom the burden lies)  has
    failed to show the contrary.

 4. The judge erred in thinking that he was bound to accept the  claimant's
    version of events.  I set aside  his  determination  and  substitute  a
    determination dismissing the claimant's appeal.
