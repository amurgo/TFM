                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Ferguson, promulgated on 17th June 2015, following a  hearing  at
    Birmingham on 29th May 2015.  In the determination, the  judge  allowed
    the appeal of Naeem Aslam Raja.  The  Respondent  subsequently  applied
    for, and was granted, permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal,  and
    thus the matter comes before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Pakistan, who was  born  on  25th
    January 1983.  He appeals against the refusal of  a  spouse's  visa  to
    join his wife, Mrs Nisa, who is also his first cousin,  and  who  is  a
    British citizen, who had herself entered the UK in 2005 as a spouse  of
    a man from whom she is now divorced.  Mr Raja's application was refused
    by the Entry Clearance Officer on the basis of his  inability  to  meet
    the income threshold requirements with respect to his sponsoring  wife,
    as set out in Appendix FM.  His sponsoring wife, Mrs Nisa,  worked  for
    three different employers, Mitie, Abacus Cleaning and for a Mrs Farzana
    Sakanda.  The Entry Clearance Officer accepted that pay slips  for  all
    three employments had been submitted but that the total average  annual
    gross income  is  only  �17,058  which  is  insufficient  to  meet  the
    financial requirements under the Immigration Rules.

The Judge's Findings

 3. The judge observed that the majority of the income that the  sponsoring
    wife relies upon to meet the �18,600 financial threshold requirement is
    her work as a carer for Mrs Sakander.  The HMRC  letter  confirms  that
    she declared her income from this work since 2013 and it was �3,659 for
    the tax year to 5th April 2015.  The figure provided is only  for  four
    months of employment.  But if one added to the income from the cleaning
    jobs, at the date of the application, Mrs Nisa demonstrated  an  income
    of �18,274, which was just �300 short of the total  annual  income  she
    was required to establish (see paragraph 13).  The judge held  that  if
    one adds her cleaning work income for 2013/2014 to  the  other  income,
    then this "gives a figure  of  �19,279",  and  that  "at  the  date  of
    decision" her income was above the �18,600  required  by  Appendix  FM.
    The appeal was allowed.

Grounds of Application

 4. The grounds of application state that the judge materially  misdirected
    himself by law by ignoring the requirements set out in the  Immigration
    Rules regarding the supporting documentary evidence by disregarding the
    fact that the Sponsor's evidence of income postdated the  decision  and
    the judge made a mistake as to a material  factor  in  calculating  the
    Sponsor's annual income.  He took into account postdecision documentary
    evidence.

 5. On 26th August 2015, permission to appeal was granted.

Submissions

 6. At the hearing before me  on  6th  November  2015,  the  Appellant  was
    unrepresented, but a Mr Khawar Fayyaz, the  nephew  of  Mrs  Nisa,  the
    sponsoring wife, attended court as a McKenzie friend, an interpreter Mr
    Syed Hussain, was present to interpret in Punjabi.

 7. Since it was the Respondent's appeal, Mr Kandola began by stating  that
    there were at least three major errors  in  the  determination  of  the
    judge.  First, the judge was wrong to take into account the date of the
    decision as a benchmark.   The  relevant  date  was  the  date  of  the
    application.  However, he states that "the earned income at the date of
    the decision is  above  the  �18,600  required  by  Appendix  FM"  (see
    paragraph 15).  This was important because if one looks at page 1176 of
    Phelan, the Rules are stated quite clearly to imply  that  evidence  of
    income six months prior to the date of the  application  is  needed  to
    meet the financial threshold requirement.  However, what the judge does
    (at paragraph 14) is to shift the  goalposts  by  considering  evidence
    that postdates the decision.  He considers the income from May 2014  to
    October 2014, but this is after the date of  the  application.   In  so
    doing, the judge took the wrong tax year into account as  a  result  of
    this error.

 8. Second, the judge's taking into account  of  the  wrong  tax  year  was
    clearly a material error of law.  Third, the judge did  not  deal  with
    the refusal letter.  This confirmed that the Appellant was  �300  short
    of meeting the Immigration Rules.  That was the end of the matter.  The
    judge could not have gone on to  consider  postdecision  evidence  that
    showed the shortfall being made up subsequently.  If  those  funds  now
    exist, the only proper course of action is for the Appellant to reapply
    again in a fresh  application.   Finally,  as  far  as  Article  8  was
    concerned, the "near miss" principle did not apply and, given that  the
    higher courts had upheld the application of the financial  requirements
    test,  freestanding  Article  8  jurisprudence  could  not  assist  the
    Appellant.

 9. For her part, the Sponsor explained through her nephew  that  when  the
    application was submitted there was a P60 and that she started her  job
    in November, but there were no wage slips and for this  reason  letters
    from the three employers were submitted to show the income earned.  The
    tax letter from HMRC confirms earnings of �18,600.

Error of Law

10. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that  I  should  set  aside  the  decision  and  remake  the
    decision.  My reasons are as follows.

11. First, the Appellant had to show six months period of earnings prior to
    the date of the application, but the judge had found at paragraph 13 of
    the determination that this income threshold could not be demonstrated.



12. Second, where the judge allowed the appeal, he did not  do  so  on  the
    basis of bank  statements  having  been  produced  to  demonstrate  the
    receipt of the salary claimed as  a  mandatory  requirement  under  the
    Rules.

13. Third, paragraph 2 of Appendix FM makes it clear that, where  there  is
    salaried employment, evidence of (a) wage slips covering  a  period  of
    six months prior to the date of the application must be  produced;  and
    (b) personal bank statements corresponding to the same  period  as  the
    wage slips have to show that the salary has been paid into the  account
    of the name of the person whose income is in issue.  Unfortunately none
    of this was demonstrated before the judge.  The Appellant today has not
    appeared with her best foot forward as she has not been represented  by
    a legal representative, but has sought the assistance of a nephew,  who
    has not been able to help in  putting  matters  across  as  clearly  as
    should be the case.  The burden of proof is upon the Appellant.  It was
    not discharged before the First-tier Tribunal and nothing has been said
    today to show that the decision arrived at by the judge  was  one  that
    was open to him.

Remaking the Decision

14. I have remade the decision on the basis of the findings of the original
    judge, the evidence before him, and the submissions that I  have  heard
    today.  I am dismissing this appeal for the reasons that I have already
    given.  The Appellant  cannot  succeed  under  the  Rules  because  the
    relevant wage slips and the relevant  bank  statements  have  not  been
    produced for  a  period  of  six  months  prior  to  the  date  of  the
    application and regard to postdecision evidence is not open to be taken
    into account.  The only course of action for this Appellant is to apply
    again in a fresh application.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside  the  decision  of  the
original  judge.   I  remake  the  decision  as  follows.   This  appeal  is
dismissed.

No anonymity order is made.
