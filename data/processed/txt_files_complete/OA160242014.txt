                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Entry Clearance Officer against a decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Malone) allowing the appeal  of  Mr  Ali
    Ugurlu (hereafter "the claimant") against the ECO's decision  taken  on
    24 November 2014  refusing  him  entry  clearance  as  the  partner  of
    Christine Ugurlu, a British citizen present  and  settled  in  the  UK,
    under section E-ECP of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules (HC 395  as
    amended).

 2. The ECO appeals with leave granted by the First-tier Tribunal (Judge  P
    J M Hollingworth) on 12 October 2015.

The Judge's Decision

 3. The judge dismissed the claimant's appeal under the Immigration  Rules.
    He accepted that the relationship between the  claimant  and  his  wife
    (whom he referred to as "Ms Sage") was a genuine one  but  he  did  not
    accept that the claimant had  established  the  required  gross  annual
    income of �18,600 at the date  of  application  on  the  basis  of  the
    "specified documents" required by Appendix FM-SE.

 4. Having reached  that  finding,  the  judge  went  on  to  consider  the
    claimant's case under Art 8 outside the Rules.  Having cited  a  number
    of authorities and referred to s.117A and s.117B  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 ("the NIA Act 2002"), at  para  42  the
    judge accepted that the claimant and sponsor enjoyed  family  life  and
    that the ECO's refusal interfered with that  family  life.   The  judge
    said this:

         "I find the Appellant enjoys family life with Ms. Sage. I find that
         the ECO's refusal interferes with that family life. It has resulted
         in their being kept apart for over six months. On  the  basis  that
         the Appellant and Ms. Sage did enjoy a  genuine  relationship,  the
         ECO did not suggest that it would be reasonable to expect Ms.  Sage
         to go and live in Turkey with the Appellant, thereby  avoiding  any
         interference."

 5. At para 43,  the  judge  concluded  that  the  ECO's  decision  was  in
    accordance with the law and in pursuance of a legitimate aim.

 6. At paras 44-53, the judge considered the issue of proportionality.  The
    judge concluded that there were  "compelling  reasons"  such  that  the
    refusal of entry clearance was disproportionate.  He said this:

         "44.  I  turn  to  consider  the  question  of  proportionality.  I
             acknowledge that  the  maintenance  of  effective  immigration
             controls is in  the  public  interest.  The  Appellant  speaks
             English to the requisite standard. When he was in  the  United
             Kingdom, he worked here, albeit illegally. As will appear from
             what I set out below, I am satisfied that, were the  Appellant
             to be granted leave to enter the United Kingdom,  he  and  Ms.
             Sage  would  be   wholly   financially   self-sufficient   and
             independent. I bear  in  mind  s.117B(4)(b);  the  Appellant's
             relationship with Ms. Sage was established when the  Appellant
             was in the United Kingdom unlawfully.

         45.  I am required by s.117A(2) to have regard to all  the  matters
             set out in s.117B. That I have done. However, while satisfying
             all the matters set out  in  s.117B  does  not  result  in  an
             applicant succeeding, failure to satisfy one  of  the  matters
             does not result in failure. Each case has to be considered  on
             its own facts. The matters set out in s.117B are ones to which
             I must "have regard".

         46.  In addressing  proportionality,  I  have  borne  in  mind  the
             Appellant's  past  immigration  history.  It  shows   he   has
             overstayed in this country for a not inconsiderable period.

         47.  I have dismissed this appeal under the Immigration Rules (3.1)
             because  the  Appellant  failed  to  satisfy  the  rigours  of
             Appendix FM-SE.

         48.  I note that while the ECO did not expressly accept  the  claim
             Ms. Sage earned a gross annual income of �18,500, he  did  not
             reject it. Equally, the ECM did not reject the claim that  Ms.
             Sage earned an additional �1,300 per month from her work as  a
             bank nurse.

         49.  In addressing Article 8, neither  the  ECO  nor  the  ECM  had
             regard to Ms. Sage's P60 for fye 5 April 2014, albeit the  ECM
             acknowledged the document wrongly as being  for  fye  5  April
             2015. The P60 showed a  gross  annual  income  of  �19,953.13.
             There was no reason for me to doubt  the  genuineness  of  the
             P60.

         50.  I find it probable that as at date of  application,  Ms.  Sage
             earned a gross annual income in excess of �18,600.  There  was
             no evidence to suggest that her income would have fallen  from
             that for fye April 2014.

         51.  I therefore ask myself whether there are "compelling  reasons"
             to justify my allowing this  appeal.  Is  the  ECO's  decision
             disproportionate (see SS Congo): paragraph 40).

         52.  In addressing Article 8 in leave to enter  cases,  whether  an
             applicant has satisfied the requirements  of  the  Immigration
             Rules  illuminates  the  Article  8  balancing  exercise  (see
             Mostafa: paragraph 18).

         53.  After careful consideration, I have  come  to  the  conclusion
             that when the Appellant's failure to  satisfy  the  evidential
             requirements set out in Appendix FM-SE is balanced against the
             hardship caused to both the Appellant  and  Ms.  Sage  by  the
             ECO's refusal, in circumstances where I have found it probable
             that Ms. Sage earned the requisite  annual  amount  under  the
             Immigration  Rules,  there  are  compelling  reasons  why  the
             Appellant should be granted leave to enter the United  Kingdom
             outside the Immigration Rules on human rights grounds. I  find
             the ECO's decision is disproportionate. It would  be  idle  to
             require the Appellant to incur all the cost of making  another
             entry clearance application and be further separated from  Ms.
             Sage while it was awaiting resolution."

 7. Accordingly, the judge allowed the appeal under Art 8.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

 8. Before us, the sponsor attended on behalf of the Claimant and the Entry
    Clearance Officer was represented by Mr Richards.

 9. Mr Richards relied upon the grounds of appeal which he developed in his
    oral submissions.  Mr Richards submitted that the judge  had  erred  in
    law in a number of respects in considering the claimant's case  outside
    the Rules.

10. First, he submitted that although  the  judge  had  made  reference  to
    s.117B at para 45  of  his  determination,  thereafter  he  had  failed
    properly to have regard to the public interest in effective immigration
    control given that the claimant could not succeed under the Rules.

11. Secondly,  Mr  Richards  submitted  that  the  judge  had,  in  effect,
    erroneously treated the claimant's case as a "near miss" and had  found
    a breach of Art 8 in effect on that basis.

12. Thirdly, Mr Richards submitted that the judge had been  wrong  to  find
    that there were "compelling reasons" given that the  claimant  had  not
    shown (and continued before the judge to be unable to show) that he met
    the  requirements  of  the  Rule  on  the  basis   of   the   specified
    documentation in Appendix FM-SE.  Mr Richards submitted that the  judge
    was wrong to find that there were "compelling reasons"  simply  on  the
    basis that on the evidence, even though not satisfying the requirements
    of Appendix FM-SE, the claimant could show that  the  sponsor's  income
    exceeded �18,600.  That was not a compelling reason  for  allowing  the
    appeal.

Error of Law

13. The proper approach to the application of Art 8 outside the Immigration
    Rules (in the non-deportation  context)  is  a  jurisprudentially  well
    trodden path both in the Court of Appeal (see,  e.g.  R(Nagre)  v  SSHD
    [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin); Singh and Khalid v SSHD [2015]  EWCA  Civ  74;
    (both removal cases); and SS (Congo) and others v SSHD [2015] EWCA  387
    (an entry clearance case)) and in the Upper Tribunal (see, e.g.  Forman
    (ss 117A-C considerations) [2015] UKUT 412 (IAC)).

14. We do not here need to set  out  the  principles  in  any  detail.   It
    suffices to identify that there is a two stage process and the  general
    approach.  First,  a  decision  must  be  made  whether  an  individual
    succeeds under the Immigration Rules.  If he has a right of  appeal  on
    that ground, he will succeed.  If he can only appeal  on  human  rights
    grounds,  complying  with  the  Rules  will  be  a  "weighty"  but  not
    determinative factor in assessing proportionality providing Art 8.1  is
    engaged on the basis of a sufficiently serious  interference  with  the
    individual's private and family life (see, Mostafa (Article 8 in  entry
    clearance) [2015] UKUT 112 (IAC) and Kaur (visit  appeals;  Article  8)
    [2015] UKUT 487 (IAC)).

15. Secondly, if the individual does not  succeed  under  the  Rules,  then
    consideration must be given  to  whether  the  individual  can  succeed
    outside the Rules under Art 8.  In order to do so, the jurisprudence is
    clear that the individual  must  establish  "compelling  circumstances"
    having  regard  to  all  the  circumstances  including  those   already
    considered under the  Rules.   That  approach  is  applicable  in  both
    removal cases (see, e.g. Nagre) and in entry clearance cases (see, e.g.
    SS (Congo)).  Equally, it is clear that, so  far  as  relevant  to  the
    individual case, a judge must "have regard" to  the  statutory  factors
    set out in s.117B of the NIA Act 2002 in substance (see,  e.g.  Bossade
    (ss.117A-D-interrelationship with Rules)  [2015]  UKUT  415  (IAC)  and
    Forman (ss 117A-C considerations) [2015] UKUT 412  (IAC))  but  is  not
    confined to those factors in considering the public interest (see, e.g.
    Rajendran (s117B - family life) [2016] UKUT 138 (IAC) and Bossade).

16. In our judgment, whilst Judge Malone applied the 2 stage  approach,  he
    erred in law in a number of respects.

17. First, in concluding that there were  "compelling  reasons"  the  judge
    failed properly to carry out the balancing exercise taking into account
    the strong public interest in effective immigration control given  that
    the claimant could not succeed under the Rules.

18. Although the judge made reference to "effective  immigration  controls"
    (see para 44), he appears at para 52 wrongly to approach the case as if
    the claimant has satisfied the requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules
    (see, e.g. his reference to Mostafa [2015] UKUT 00112 (IAC)  -  a  case
    where the appellant met the requirements of the Rules).

19. The claimant simply could not  establish  that  he  met  the  financial
    requirements based on the required documentation under Appendix  FM-SE.
    In SS (Congo), the Court of Appeal recognised that the evidential rules
    in Appendix FM-SE were no less a reflection of the public interest than
    were the substantive requirements of the Rules  themselves  (see  [50]-
    [53]).  Here, the fact that the claimant could establish on  the  basis
    of evidence not complying with Appendix  FM-SE  (namely  the  sponsor's
    P60) that she had a gross annual income in excess of  �18,600  did  not
    negate the public interest reflected in  the  fact  that  the  claimant
    still could not succeed under the Immigration Rules.

20. Secondly, and linked to that reasoning, the judge  effectively  allowed
    the claimant's appeal on the basis that  the  compelling  circumstances
    (or as he calls them "reasons") were that the appellant had, in effect,
    met the substance of the Rules and it was a  "near  miss"  because  the
    necessary documentation was not produced.  In para 53, the  judge  does
    refer to "hardship" caused to the sponsor and  claimant  by  the  ECO's
    refusal, but there was no evidence before the  judge  of  any  hardship
    apart from that necessarily  flowing  from  the  fact  that  until  the
    claimant obtained entry clearance the sponsor and claimant would not be
    able to live together and their contact would be limited to visits  and
    other forms of distance contact.  His decision  must,  therefore,  rest
    upon a  view that the Rules are effectively met and, to the extent they
    were not, it was a  'near  miss'  based  on  the  technicality  of  the
    documentation required under Appendix FM-SE.

21. In SS (Congo), the Court of Appeal identified the error  in  concluding
    that a "near miss" case amounted, in itself, to compelling circumstance
    to justify the grant of entry clearance outside the  Rules.   At  [55],
    Richards  LJ  (delivering  the  judgment  of  the  Court)  said   this:



         "... the fact that an applicant may be able to say that their  case
         is a 'near miss' in relation to satisfying the requirements of  the
         Rules will by no means show  that  compelling  circumstances  exist
         requiring the grant of LTE outside the Rules. A good deal more than
         this would  need  to  be  shown  to  make  out  such  a  case.  The
         respondents' argument fails to recognise the value to  be  attached
         to having a clear statement of the standards applicable to everyone
         and fails to give proper weight to the judgment of the Secretary of
         State, as expressed in the Rules, regarding what is needed to  meet
         the public interest which is in issue. The 'near miss' argument  of
         the  respondents  cannot  be  sustained  in  the  light  of   these
         considerations and the authority of Miah v Secretary of  State  for
         the Home Department [2012] EWCA Civ 261, especially at  [21]-[26]."



22. That said, the Court of Appeal recognised that a "near  miss"  argument
    was not  necessarily  "wholly  irrelevant  to  the  balancing  exercise
    required under Art 8" (see [56]).  The court identified  the  relevance
    as follows at [56]:

         "If an applicant can show that there are  individual  interests  at
         stake covered by Article 8 which give rise to a strong  claim  that
         compelling circumstances may exist to  justify  the  grant  of  LTE
         outside the Rules, the fact that their case is also a  'near  miss'
         case may be a relevant consideration which tips the  balance  under
         Article 8 in their favour. In such a case, the  applicant  will  be
         able to say that the detrimental impact on the public  interest  in
         issue if LTE is granted in their favour will be somewhat less  than
         in a case where the gap between the applicant's  position  and  the
         requirements of the Rules is great, and the risk that they may  end
         up having recourse to  public  funds  and  resources  is  therefore
         greater."

23. At [57], the court rejected the arguments put forward by those  seeking
    entry in the cases before the court that "improvements in the  position
    of their sponsors" which were "on the horizon" as  to  their  financial
    position provided anything other than "very  weak  support"  for  their
    claims to entry clearance.  The court said this:

         "The Secretary of State remains entitled to enforce  the  Rules  in
         the usual way, to say that the Rules have not  been  satisfied  and
         that the applicant should apply again when the  circumstances  have
         indeed changed. This reflects a fair balance between the  interests
         of the individual and the public interest.  The Secretary of  State
         is not required to take  a  speculative  risk  as  to  whether  the
         requirements in the Rules will in fact be satisfied in  the  future
         when deciding what to do. Generally, it is fair that the  applicant
         should  wait  until  the  circumstances  have   changed   and   the
         requirements in the Rules are satisfied and then apply, rather than
         attempting to jump the queue by asking for  preferential  treatment
         outside the Rules in advance."

24. In our judgment, Judge Malone was wrong, therefore, to find "compelling
    circumstances" based, in effect, upon the fact that the claimant  could
    establish, but not in accordance with Appendix FM-SE, that  her  income
    reached the substantive level set out in the Rules.  That,  in  itself,
    was not a "compelling circumstance" to  outweigh  the  public  interest
    reflected in the fact that the requirements of the Rules were not  met.



25. Thirdly, unusually in an entry clearance case s.117B(4)(b) of  the  NIA
    Act 2002  applied  in  that  "little  weight"  should  be  given  to  a
    relationship formed with a qualifying partner that is "established by a
    person at a time when the person is in the United Kingdom  unlawfully".
    Here, the claimant had previously been in the  UK  unlawfully.   During
    that time he established  his  relationship  with  the  sponsor  before
    leaving the UK for Turkey on  22  August  2014.   Of  course,  even  if
    s.117B(4)(b)  did  not  apply  because  the  individual  seeking  entry
    clearance  had  not  been  in  the  UK  or  had  not  established   the
    relationship whilst in the UK, nevertheless  that  would  be  a  highly
    relevant factor - namely that the relationship was formed whilst he was
    unlawfully in the UK - under the Strasbourg jurisprudence  (see,  e.g.
    Rodrigues da Silva and Hoogkamer v Netherlands [2007] 44  EHRR  34  and
    Jeunesse v Netherlands,  app.no.12738/10  (CJEC,  GC)).   Although  the
    judge stated (at para 44 of his determination)  that  he  had  in  mind
    s.117B(4)(b) in carrying  out  an  assessment  of  whether  there  were
    "compelling circumstances" to outweigh the public interest,  the  judge
    failed to have proper regard to  the  fact  that  the  relationship  is
    entitled to "little weight".

26. Fourthly, in para 53 the judge was wrong to state that it was "idle" to
    require the  claimant  to  incur  the  cost  of  making  another  entry
    clearance application.  It is not clear to us  why  it  was  "idle"  to
    require the claimant to satisfy the requirements of the Rules including
    the evidential requirements in Appendix FM-SE.  We can only  understand
    the judge's reasoning to be, perhaps by analogy with  the  approach  in
    removal cases where an individual can establish that on return to  seek
    entry clearance he would meet the requirements of the Rules, that there
    is no good reason to require him to do so (see Chikwamba v SSHD  [2008]
    UKHL 40).  In this case, the claimant  did  not  establish  before  the
    judge that he did, or would, meet the  financial  requirements  of  the
    Rules.  The  public  interest  remained  that,  as  a  generality,  the
    requirements of  the  Rules  must  be  met  in  substance  and  on  the
    evidential basis required by Appendix FM-SE.

27. For these reasons, therefore, Judge  Malone's  decision  to  allow  the
    claimant's appeal under Art 8 involved the making of an error  of  law.
    It cannot stand and we set it aside.

Remaking the Decision

28. We now turn to remake the decision under Art 8.

29. We apply the two-stage process to Art 8.

30. As regards the Rules, the claimant cannot succeed under the Rules as he
    cannot establish he met the financial requirements of  Appendix  FM  on
    the basis of 'specified documents' set out in Appendix FM-SE.

31. We turn then to consider Art 8 outside the Rules.   This  is  an  entry
    clearance case and so engages the positive  obligations  of  the  State
    under Art 8 to respect an individual's private and family life but,  as
    the case law recognises, any analysis must draw heavily on the approach
    in negative obligation cases looking at Art 8.1 (for engagement of  art
    8) and Art 8.2 (for any justification for a breach of  Art  8.1)  (see,
    e.g.   SS(Congo)   at   [39(ii)]   citing   the   relevant   Strasbourg
    jurisprudence).  It is helpful to consider  the  5-stages  set  out  in
    Razgar [2004] UKHL 24.

32. First, the judge found that the claimant  and  sponsor  enjoyed  family
    life and that it would not be reasonable to expect the sponsor to  live
    in Turkey with the claimant.  Mr Richards did  not  seek  to  challenge
    that finding and we accept it.

33. Secondly, we also accept that the ECO's refusal  would  interfere  with
    the future enjoyment of family life between the  claimant  and  sponsor
    sufficiently seriously to engage Art 8.  Although, the sponsor told  us
    that she was able to visit her husband about twice a year depending  on
    her holiday entitlement, we accept that qualitatively the  sponsor  and
    claimant would not be able to enjoy family life as husband and wife.

34. Thirdly, there is no doubt that the ECO's  decision  is  in  accordance
    with the law and is in  pursuance  of  a  legitimate  aim,  namely  the
    economic well-being of the country and for the prevention  of  disorder
    or crime.

35. Fourthly, we must consider the issue of proportionality and in order to
    establish that the refusal of entry clearance is disproportionate,  the
    claimant  must  establish  "compelling  circumstances"  sufficient   to
    outweigh the public interest reflected in  s.117B(1)  of  the  NIA  Act
    2002, namely the "maintenance of effective immigration controls".

36. As regards the claimant's ability to speak  English,  the  judge  found
    that the appellant speaks English to the requisite standard  (see  para
    44). That finding was  not  challenged  by  Mr  Richards.   The  public
    interest criterion in s.117B(2) does not, therefore,  adversely  impact
    upon the appellant.  However, the fact that he speaks English does  not
    add any, or any significant weight to the claimant's case  (see  AM  (S
    117B) Malawi [2015] UKUT 260 (IAC)).

37. Further, given the judge's finding that the sponsor has a gross  annual
    income of �19,953.13 - which was not  disputed  by  Mr  Richards  -  we
    accept that the claimant is likely to be "financially  independent"  as
    set out in s.117B(3) of the NIA Act 2002.  But, again, that adds little
    positively  to  the  appellant's   claim   (see   Forman   (ss   117A-C
    considerations) [2015] UKUT 412 (IAC)).

38. We have regard  to  s.117B(4),  namely  that  the  relationship  formed
    between the claimant and sponsor was established at  a  time  when  the
    claimant was in the UK unlawfully and therefore is entitled to  "little
    weight".

39. The judge does not refer to any evidence, and we were not  referred  to
    any evidence, that the impact upon the  sponsor  and  claimant  of  the
    ECO's refusal of entry clearance gave rise to any greater  hardship  or
    any greater impact than inevitably follows from the fact that they  are
    separated  as  a  result  of  the  claimant's  inability  to  meet  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules.

40. We do not consider this to be a "near miss" case simply  on  the  basis
    that the claimant failed to produce the  required  documentation  under
    Appendix FM-SE.  But, even if it were, that  in  itself,  following  SS
    (Congo), could not amount to "compelling circumstances"  sufficient  to
    outweigh the public interest.

41.  Carrying  out  the  balancing  exercise  inherent  in  the  issue   of
    proportionality, the public interest in effective  immigration  control
    is engaged in this case.  We  accept  that,  subject  to  a  successful
    future application for entry clearance, the sponsor and  claimant  will
    be unable to carry on the normal family life of a married couple living
    together.  Nevertheless, even taking into account the positive  aspects
    of the claimant's case, the circumstances are  not,  in  our  judgment,
    sufficiently "compelling" to outweigh the public interest.

42.  It  may  well  be  that  the  changed  (more   favourable)   financial
    circumstances  of  the  sponsor,  coupled  with  the  Entry   Clearance
    Officer's acceptance that the relationship is 'genuine and  subsisting'
    may hold out greater hope of success  in  any  future  application  for
    entry clearance but that is a matter for the Entry  Clearance  Officer,
    in the light of any evidence presented, and not for us.

43. For these reasons, the claimant has failed to establish on a balance of
    probabilities that the ECO's decision breaches Art 8 of the ECHR.

Decision

44. For the above reasons, the decision of the First-tier Tribunal to allow
    the claimant's appeal under Art 8 involved the making of  an  error  of
    law.  We set that decision aside.

45. We remake the decision dismissing the claimant's appeal under Art 8.

46. The judge's  decision  to  dismiss  the  claimant's  appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules was not challenged and stands.
