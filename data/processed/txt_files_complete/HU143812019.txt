                            DECISION AND REASONS
           (Decision given orally at the hearing of 17 June 2020)

Introduction

 1. This is an appeal against the decision  of  Designated  Judge  McClure,
    promulgated on 9 January 2020, dismissing an appeal against a  decision
    of the Secretary of State refusing the appellant's human rights claim -
    such decision being taken on 23 August 2019.  The  decision  to  refuse
    the  human  rights  claim  incorporated  within  it,   a   "deportation
    decision", a deportation order having previously  been  signed  by  the
    Secretary of State of 19 August 2019.

Permission to Appeal

 2. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was  granted  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge O'Brien in a decision of 3 February 2020,  the  relevant
    parts of that decision reading as follows:

    "(3) The decision makes no reference to having heard live evidence from
         Ms [A].  Furthermore, the  judge's  own  notes  do  not  appear  to
         contain any record of live evidence from Ms [A].  Notes attached to
         the application purport to be the appellant's representative's  own
         notes of live evidence given by Ms [A] at the  hearing.   Ms  [A]'s
         evidence will clearly have been material.

    (4)  Providing that the appellant's  representative  will  be  able  to
         confirm the provenance of the notes attached to the application, it
         is arguable that the judge failed to consider material evidence and
         so erred in law."

 3. To put the grant of permission into its proper context, it is  asserted
    that Ms [A] and her son (who has recently turned 18 years old)  have  a
    family life with the appellant - Ms [A] claiming to be the  appellant's
    fiancï¿½e.

Decision and Reasons

 4. Despite the indication in the grant of permission that the  appellant's
    representative would be required  to  confirm  the  provenance  of  the
    hearing  notes  attached  thereto,  (which  purported  to  support  the
    assertion that Ms [A] had given oral evidence), the Tribunal has  still
    not been provided with a witness  statement  from  the  author  of  the
    notes.

 5. Nevertheless, at the outset of the hearing  Mrs  Aboni  confirmed  that
    having read the minutes of  the  hearing  produced  by  the  Presenting
    Officer who appeared before the First-tier  Tribunal,  she  is  content
    that Ms [A] did indeed provide oral evidence to that Tribunal.  In such
    circumstances, she accepted that the First-tier Tribunal had  erred  in
    failing to (i) identify that such oral evidence had been given and (ii)
    take account of such evidence.  Mrs Aboni  further  conceded  that  the
    failure to take account  of  Ms  [A]'s  oral  evidence  amounted  to  a
    material error of law that should lead  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal's
    decision being set aside.

 6. Given the aforementioned concession, I provide only brief reasons as to
    why I set aside the First-tier Tribunal's decision.

 7. First, it is not in dispute between the parties that Ms [A]  gave  oral
    evidence to the First-tier Tribunal. Second, I observe that despite the
    First-tier Tribunal identifying, in paragraph 36 of its  decision,  the
    names of those witnesses who provided oral evidence before it, Ms [A]'s
    name is not therein identified. Third, it is not obvious  from  reading
    the First-tier Tribunal's decision as a whole  that  the  Tribunal  had
    regard to Ms [A]'s oral evidence. Furthermore, having read  the  First-
    tier Tribunal's record of proceedings I  cannot  readily  identify  any
    passages therein which record the oral evidence provided by Ms [A].

 8. Whilst I have some concerns over the materiality of the failure of  the
    First-tier Tribunal to take account  of  Ms  [A]'s  oral  evidence,  Ms
    Aboni, on behalf of the SSHD, did not  share  such  concerns.  In  such
    circumstances, where both parties agree on the issue of the materiality
    of the First-tier Tribunal's error, I  conclude  that  the  appropriate
    course is to set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

 9. As to the forum for the remaking of the decision on  the  appeal,  once
    again both parties were  in  concurrence  that  the  appropriate  forum
    should be the First-tier Tribunal.  I agree that this is so because the
    error identified is, in my view, of a type that falls within this scope
    of  Practice  Direction  7.2(a)  of  the  Practice  Statements  of  the
    Immigration & Asylum Chambers of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  Upper
    Tribunal, i.e. the effect of the error has  been  to  deprive  a  party
    before the First-tier Tribunal of a fair hearing.

Decision

10. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside, and the appeal is
    remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be determined de novo by a judge
    other than Designated Judge McClure.


Signed

Upper Tribunal Judge O'Connor
