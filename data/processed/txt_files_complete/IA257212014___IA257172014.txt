                                     and

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent



                          NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL AND

                   REASONS FOR THE TRIBUNAL GIVING CONSENT

 1. The appellants are citizens of China who  appealed  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal against the decision of the Secretary of State of 9 June 2014.
    The  First-tier  Tribunal  dismissed  the  appeal  in  a  determination
    promulgated on 1 October 2014. First-tier Tribunal Judge Kelly  granted
    the appellant permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.

 2. By way of a letter dated 26 June 2015 to the Upper  Tribunal  from  the
    First Appellant,  written  also  on  behalf  of  her  son,  the  Second
    Appellant, the appellants state that they  wish  their  appeals  to  be
    treated as withdrawn by the Upper Tribunal.

 3. Consent of the Upper Tribunal is required for a party to  withdraw  its
    case. Having carefully considered the facts of this appeal as a  whole,
    and observing that the Secretary of  State  was  the  successful  party
    before the First-tier Tribunal, I give such consent to the appellant to
    withdraw his case.

 4. Accordingly with my consent, and pursuant to rule 17(5) of the Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules  2008,  this  appeal  is  recorded  as
    "Withdrawn with the consent of the Upper Tribunal". This  is  a  Notice
    pursuant to rule 17(5) to inform the parties that the appellant's  case
    is withdrawn.

 5. The effect of the appellants'  case  being  withdrawn  from  the  Upper
    Tribunal is that the proceedings before the Upper Tribunal  are  at  an
    end. There is no appeal before the Upper Tribunal  and  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's decision shall stand.
