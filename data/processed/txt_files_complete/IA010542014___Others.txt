Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms B. Asigo, Solicitor of R.O.C.K solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms J. Isherwood, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                           DETERMINATION & REASONS

1.    The second and third Appellants are nationals of Nigeria,  born  on  2
August 1973 and 1 October 1979 respectively. The first  Appellant  is  their
daughter and a citizen of the Irish republic, born on 11  July  2003.  There
is a further child, Jason, born on 29 October 2005 in London but he  is  not
an Appellant in this appeal.

2.    On 12 July 2013,  the  first  Appellant  applied  for  a  registration
certificate as confirmation of the right of residence in the United  Kingdom
as a self-sufficient person.  On  3  November  2013,  this  application  was
refused with reference to regulation 6 of the Immigration (EEA)  Regulations
2006, as amended, because she failed to provide sufficient evidence to  show
that her parents/primary careers  would  be  able  to  support  her  without
recourse to public funds. The second and third Appellants also  applied  for
residence cards based on derivative rights as  the  primary  carers  of  the
first Appellant and these applications  were  also  refused  on  3  November
2013, with reference to regulation 15A(2) of the Regulations  because  there
was not sufficient evidence to show  that  the  first  Appellant  was  self-
sufficient.

3.    The Appellants appealed and  their  appeals  came  before  First  Tier
Tribunal Judge Gavin for  hearing.  On  18  March  2014,  he  dismissed  the
appeals with reference to the EEA Regulations, under the  Immigration  Rules
and on human rights grounds. An application for  permission  to  appeal  was
made and granted and following a  hearing  on  20  May  2014,  Deputy  Upper
Tribunal Judge Rimington found a material error of law in  failing  to  take
into account material evidence in the form of a letter stamped  as  received
by the Tribunal on 27 February  2014,  prior  to  the  determination,  which
attached a letter of appointment for a new job  for  Mrs  Georgina  Suleman,
the second Appellant's mother. A copy of  that  error  of  law  decision  is
attached.

4.    The resumed hearing before us on 24 June 2015 proceeded on  the  basis
agreed by both parties that the second  and  third  Appellants  are  primary
carers of the first Appellant and that the  employment  income  received  by
the second Appellant's mother, Georgina Suleman,  was  insufficient  on  its
own to meet the self-sufficiency criterion. Ms Isherwood indicated that  the
Secretary of State maintained her position  viz  she  did  not  accept  that
funds were available from Nigeria nor that medical insurance would  continue
if derivative residence cards were issued.

Oral evidence

5.    The second Appellant, Mrs Folake  Anaughe,  gave  oral  evidence.  She
adopted her witness statement and said that  nothing  had  changed  and  she
still had medical insurance. The witness was cross-examined by Ms  Isherwood
when she denied working in the United Kingdom. When asked why it  stated  on
her son, Jason's birth certificate that she was a post lady  she  said  that
the initial owner of the name was a post lady. She said that  her  husband's
information on their son's birth certificate was not false but she  admitted
that she had given false information. She  denied  having  a  bank  account.
When asked why on the medical insurance document it stated that it would  be
paid by direct debit from her bank account she said  that  this  was  agreed
but that she did not pay it as a direct debit. She was referred to  page  18
of the bundle and said she had to open an account to get  insurance  in  her
name and the account was in her name. She said that the money came from  her
mother's account since November 2014. She said that they had  cancelled  the
previous insurance because her son had not been included. She  was  referred
to pages 28, 27 and 25 of the bundle and asked why she had  3  letters  from
family insurance services to which she responded that she had done  this  on
line and they acted like a middleman between her and the general  insurance.
She was asked about the medical insurance document at page 16 and said  that
this had been taken out in July 2013 but had been cancelled  but  she  could
not remember why she had cancelled it. In respect of the WPA  insurance  she
said that this had been cancelled because she had to include her son in  the
new insurance. She stated that this had been taken out in February 2014.  It
was pointed out that general medical insurance had been taken out in  August
2014 without her son and different insurance had been taken out  in  October
2014 which also did not include her son. She was unable to explain why  both
policies, which were for a year, had been cancelled. She said that they  had
a current policy for four members. She said that her mother paid  for  it  -
see page 34 of the bundle. She said that her mother paid over the  phone  so
she was not sure if she could show from bank statements that she was  paying
regularly for medical insurance.

6.    She was asked again if she had ever had a bank  account  in  her  name
and she said that she had  had  an  account  in  the  false  name.  She  was
referred to page 185 of the bundle, which showed that  the  witness'  mother
was constantly transferring �20 from a  Halifax  account.  The  witness  was
asked whether the money was being transferred into an account  in  her  name
and she denied this. She said that her mother gave her and  her  husband  an
allowance every month but this  was  not  by  way  of  a  transfer  into  an
account. In respect of her stepfather's estate she said that she would  need
to ask her mother but the money  was  paid  into  her  sister's  account  in
Nigeria and that was paid into her mother's account and she had a card.  She
denied that anyone else used the money except her mother. She then  accepted
that her brother in law paid money into that account sometimes and  that  it
was owned by her brother in law and FCMB. She said  that  "Jasper"  was  the
name of her mother's late husband. She said, with reference to page  12  and
the reference to Priye that this was not the account that they used  in  the
United Kingdom but this  FCMB  account  was  her  sister  and  her  sister's
husband's account and shows money paid by  the  estate  into  this  account.
When asked why her brother in law paid money  into  that  account  she  said
that sometimes he travelled to the United Kingdom and used it as  well.  She
said that money went from the estate to the FCMB account and from  there  to
the standard account and that her mother has a card to withdraw  money  from
the standard account. When referred to page 208 she said that she could  not
answer any questions about why her brother in  law  was  paying  money  into
that account and in terms of the  deposits  into  that  account  her  sister
phones her mother and says that money has been paid into  the  account.  She
said that her mother could answer as to the other people who  deposit  money
into this account.

7.    Upon re-examination the Second Appellant said that her mother had  two
Halifax accounts and a  cash  card,  which  was  available  for  the  Second
Appellant's own use. She said that �114.10 was paid monthly  in  respect  of
insurance and this was about �120 prior to November and  had  been  paid  in
the same way. She said her mother was  not  entitled  to  any  other  money,
excluding money from the estate.

8.    The second Appellant's mother, Georgina Suleman, was  then  called  to
give evidence. She said that money from her late husband's estate  was  paid
into the account in Nigeria and she drew it out  from  the  United  Kingdom.
She said her daughter [the second Appellant] did not have  a  bank  account.
She said the medical insurance was paid from her own bank account. She  also
said: "I just give her my card at the  end  of  the  month  to  do  all  the
payments that need to be paid." Upon cross-examination  she  said  that  she
had been paying medical insurance for the family for  about  3-4  years  and
the reference to �175 at page 194 was a medical insurance payment.  She  was
asked why this was the only reference in all the bank statements to  medical
insurance being paid and she said that she knew they paid  monthly  and  she
had no idea why this was not reflected. She  confirmed  this  was  the  bank
account she used. She said she had recently changed a  few  things  paid  by
direct debit. She said that she did not have access  to  the  whole  of  the
money given on behalf of her late husband. She  said  that  the  money  went
into her son in law's business account. She  said  that  she  would  receive
250,000/500,000 naira a month. She clarified that she would receive  250,000
naira from the estate and Deborah, her daughter in Nigeria,  would  make  it
up to 500,000 naira because  Deborah's  daughter  is  in  schooling  in  the
United Kingdom.  She paid that granddaughter's dinner money to  the  school.
On re-examination she said that  she  had  been  receiving  money  from  the
estate for 3-4 years, the money comes regularly and she will be paid it  for
life. No other witnesses were called.

9.    We heard submissions from both representatives.

The relevant legal provisions

10.   Regulation 6 of the Immigration  (EEA)  (Amendment)  Regulations  2012
defines a "qualified person" as inter alia a self-sufficient person.

11.   Regulation 15A of the Immigration (EEA) (Amendment)  Regulations  2012
provides inter alia:

    'Derivative right of residence

    15A. (1) A person ("P") who is not an exempt person and  who  satisfies
    the criteria in paragraph (2), (3), (4), (4A) or (5) of this regulation
    is entitled to a derivative right to reside in the United  Kingdom  for
    as long as P satisfies the relevant criteria.

    (2) P satisfies the criteria in this paragraph if-

       (a) P is the primary carer of an  EEA  national  ("the  relevant  EEA
       national"); and

       (b) the relevant EEA national-

         (i) is under the age of 18;

         (ii) is residing in the United Kingdom as a self-sufficient person;
         and

         (iii) would be unable to remain in the United  Kingdom  if  P  were
         required to leave.'

12.   The jurisprudence  of  the  CJEU  and  that  of  the  domestic  courts
establishes that  the  requirement  that  there  be  comprehensive  sickness
insurance cover is not a mere formality but  is  an  integral  part  of  the
concept of self-sufficiency under the Regulations cf. Lord Justice  Sullivan
in Kamau (Kenya) [2010] EWCA Civ 1302 at [15]; Ziolkowski  Joined  Cases  C-
424/10 and C-425/10 [2013] 3 CMLR 37 at [40]-[47].

Our findings of fact on the material issues

13.   The Respondent conceded that, in principle, the first Appellant  could
claim self-sufficiency from her grandmother's income,  even  though  she  is
not a primary carer. Both parties agreed that an income of �2267  plus  �114
insurance per month  was  adequate  to  meet  the  criterion  based  on  the
statement of income and expenditure provided, but two  factual  issues  were
in dispute: (i) whether the grandmother's  income  was  genuinely  available
for the support of  the  first  Appellant  and  (ii)  whether  comprehensive
sickness insurance was in place.

14.   We do not find the evidence of either  the  second  Appellant  or  her
mother, Ms Suleman to be credible. The second  Appellant  repeatedly  denied
working. She repeatedly denied having a bank account, despite the fact  that
there was a large  evidential  gap  as  to  payments  made  to  the  medical
insurance companies by way of direct  debit  and  no  evidence  that  direct
debits were being paid from Ms Suleman's bank account, bar on  one  occasion
in December 2012. She was unable to explain why, if she did not have a  bank
account, her mother's bank statements showed numerous transfers  of  �10  or
�20 or �50 from her Halifax account e.g. at pages 113, 114,  116,  185,  194
to Folake Anaughe. She claimed that this was not  a  transfer  into  a  bank
account but sometimes her mother gives her an allowance for each  month.  We
find that the fact that Ms Suleman's bank statements state TFR  or  transfer
to Folake Anaughe is a clear indication that these  payments  are  transfers
into an account held by the second Appellant and we do not accept  that  she
is telling the truth about this matter.

15.   Ms Suleman also denied that the second Appellant had a  bank  account.
Her evidence was confused and contradictory as to how the medical  insurance
payments were made. She claimed initially in examination-in-chief  that  she
would give her daughter her cash card at the end of the month and she  would
make  all  the  payments  that  needed  to  be  made.  However,  in   cross-
examination, she said that she paid the medical insurance  by  direct  debit
from her bank account but when it was put to her that  her  bank  statements
showed only one payment in this manner made on 24 December 2012 she  changed
her evidence and stated that she knew they paid monthly and she had no  idea
why this was not reflected.

16.   In respect of the issue of the actual payment  of  medical  insurance,
the evidence was incomplete and lacking in  clarity.  Ms  Isherwood  pointed
out that the evidence shows that  the  Appellants  have  taken  out  medical
insurance but none of the policies  ran  for  one  year  and  that  from  Ms
Suleman's bank statements there was only one medical  insurance  payment  in
December 2012 and no other payments. We note that at pages 34-37  of  Bundle
3 the medical insurance document from health-on-line dated 20 February  2015
states that the policy started on 21 November 2014 and payment will be  made
monthly by direct debit of �114.10 on the 25th of each month.  The  previous
policy statement of 21 November 2014 is to the same effect [75 of  Bundle  1
refers]. There is no evidence from Ms Suleman's bank statements  that  these
payments are being or have been made. The policy document is in the name  of
the second Appellant. She was  asked  on  a  number  of  occasions  by  both
representatives and by the Tribunal whether she had a bank account  but  she
denied this. There is no evidence that the medical  insurance  premiums  are
being made or have been paid apart from the one payment referred  to  above.
We find that the  second  Appellant  has  taken  out  a  number  of  medical
insurance policies, all of which have been cancelled within a  year,  except
for the most recent policy with health on line, the current status of  which
is unknown given that the most recent evidence is the  membership  statement
dated 20 February 2015. We find that there is no evidence that any  payments
have been made to health on  line,  either  by  direct  debit  or  otherwise
despite receipt of a subsequent letter as there is no  evidence  as  to  how
these payments have been made.

17.   In respect of the issue of self-sufficiency we do not  find  that  the
income of Georgina Suleman, the first  Appellant's  grandmother,  is  either
sufficient or genuinely available in its entirety for  the  support  of  the
first Appellant. Our reasons for so finding are that  in  her  evidence,  Ms
Suleman informed us that she  was  also  supporting  another  granddaughter,
from her daughter, Deborah, as this granddaughter was  attending  school  in
the United Kingdom and she was responsible for the payment of  dinner  money
to the school. Her  evidence  was  that  she  would  receive  250,000  naira
monthly from the estate of her late husband and this would  be  made  up  to
500,000 naira by Deborah. 250,000 equates to approximately  �934  per  month
based on the exchange rate provided at page 3 of Bundle 3  however  this  is
at odds with the amount of �1844 claimed in  the  statement  of  income  and
expenditure at that page, which would appear  to  include  the  amount  from
Deborah. A difficulty with the evidence is that  this  amount  is  not  paid
directly into Ms Suleman's bank account but instead she  has  been  provided
with a bank card for her daughter and her son in  law's  Standard  Chartered
Bank and is permitted to take the money from that account.  Whilst  we  have
been provided with copies of the Standard Chartered Bank  account  belonging
to Deborah and Moses Waritimi it is not possible to tell  from  the  account
who has used the bank card and for what purpose(s).  Also  the  transactions
are in naira. Most of the expenditure takes the form of debit card  payments
made in the United Kingdom but it is not  possible  to  ascertain  from  the
bank statement all the sources of  the  deposits,  except  where  those  are
clearly marked as coming from Mr Walakira's company, Simplex Engineering  or
from other named individuals. There are no deposits made  by  Bayelsa  State
government and therefore, the money from the estate  of  Ms  Suleman's  late
husband must be paid into another of Deborah  Waritimi's  accounts  and  the
amounts transferred to this account to be utilized by Ms Suleman are at  the
discretion of Mr and Mrs Waritimi. It is further not possible  to  ascertain
those  amounts  based  on  the  current  documentary   evidence   and   bank
statements. A further oddity is that the  letters  from  the  Government  of
Bayelsa State of Nigeria dated 9 November 2014 and 4 March 2015  state  that
Major Isaac Adaka Boro's family receive a  gratuity  of  3,770,000  naira  a
month. Given that Ms Suleman is Major Boro's widow it  is  entirely  unclear
why she only receives a small percentage of this gratuity and  we  were  not
told how many other relatives the gratuity supports and in what sums.

18.   We find that Ms Suleman's income from her employment is  approximately
�975.14 a month. Even giving the Appellants the benefit  of  the  doubt  and
accepting that Ms Suleman has access to a  further  250,000  naira  a  month
from her late husband's estate, this amounts to an  average  monthly  income
of �1909.14 and falls short of the amount of �2267 plus �114  insurance  per
month  it  was  agreed  was  adequate  to  met  the  criterion,  absent  any
additional funds from Deborah which are unknown and not  apparent  from  the
bank statements. We do not  accept  that  500,000  naira  monthly  from  the
estate is available to Ms Suleman and even if it is available,  that  it  is
utilized to support the first Appellant to enable her to be  self-sufficient
because an unknown part of this money is clearly used to  support  Deborah's
daughter who is at school in the United Kingdom.

19.   For the reasons set out above, we dismiss the appeal.

Conclusion

20.   The decision of the First-tier Tribunal judge having been  set  aside,
we remake the decision and dismiss the appeal.
