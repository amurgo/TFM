Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr M I Hussain, Legal Representative
For the Respondent:    Ms Tanner, Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a citizen of Sri Lanka born on  3  August  1985.   She
    appeals with permission against the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Manuel promulgated on 20 March  2013,  refusing  the  appellant's
    appeal against a decision of the respondent made on 9 January  2013  to
    refuse her leave to enter.

 2. The appellant entered the United Kingdom on 5 June 2010 with  leave  to
    remain as a student until 31 May 2012.  On 5 April 2012 she  posted  an
    application for further leave  to  remain  in  order  to  complete  her
    studies. That application was refused on 13 November 2012 on the  basis
    that the necessary funds fell below the �2,000 required by  Appendix  C
    of the Immigration Rules.  In grounds of appeal the appellant submitted
    that the date of application should be the date of posting and that the
    Rules in force at the date required the appellant to show that she  had
    �1,600 available not �2,000; and, that she had met that requirement.

 3. The matter then came before Judge  Manuel  sitting  in  Manchester  who
    found that the date of application was the date it was received by  the
    respondent, 12 April 2012; that the  appropriate  level  of  funds  was
    accordingly �2,000; and, that as the appellant's bank statements showed
    that she had less than that amount the appeal was dismissed.

 4. The respondent sought permission to appeal  on  the  grounds  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge had erred firstly in finding that the date of
    application was not the date of sending but the date it  was  received,
    contrary to Rule 34Gof the Immigration Rules and second, that the judge
    had failed to follow the relevant case law.  Permission to  appeal  was
    granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge on all grounds.

 5. It was accepted before me by Ms Tanner that the judge had erred in that
    the appropriate date for the date of application was 5 April  2013  but
    as Ms Tanner helpfully pointed out, this  was  not  a  relevant  factor
    given that the  amendment  to  the  Immigration  Rules  increasing  the
    relevant amount of money that has to be held by a Tier  4  student  had
    been increased by HC1888 with effect from 14th June 2012. She  accepted
    that there were  transitional  arrangements  in  place  under  HC  1888
    whereby an application made before 14 June 2012 was to  be  decided  in
    accordance with the Rules in force on 13 June 2012.  As Ms Tanner  very
    fairly accepted, the appellant did in fact meet the requirements of the
    Immigration Rules applicable to her given that her application had been
    made prior to 13 June on that basis.

 6. I am satisfied that the determination of the  First-tier  Tribunal  did
    involve the making of an error of law as the judge did  not  apply  the
    immigration rules which define the date of application correctly.  This
    led  to  an  error  in  her  applying  the  incorrect  version  of  the
    immigration rules. This clearly  affected  the  outcome  and  was  a  m
    aterial error, requiring the determination to be set aside.

 7. I set the determination aside and I remake it by  allowing  the  appeal
    under the Immigration Rules given that as the appellant benefited  from
    the transitional provisions set out in HC1888, she did in fact,  as  Ms
    Tanner accepted, have the required funds for the  correct  period.   In
    the circumstances there is therefore no need for me to consider whether
    the appeal is allowable on any other grounds.

Summary of Decision

 1. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside. I remake the
    determination by allowing the appeal under the immigration rules.



Signed                                  Date:  3 June 2013

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

I have allowed the appeal on the basis that the respondent did not apply
the immigration rules correctly. It follows that the appellant should not
have been put to the trouble of making an appeal, and I consider that it is
appropriate to make a full fee award in favour of the appellant
