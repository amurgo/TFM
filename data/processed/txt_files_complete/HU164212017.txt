                 REASONS FOR FINDING A MATERIAL ERROR OF LAW

The Appellant

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of  India  born  on  1  September  1988.  He
    appeals against a decision of Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  Khawar
    sitting at Taylor  House  on  19  November  2018  in  which  the  Judge
    dismissed the Appellant's appeal against a decision of  the  Respondent
    dated 24 November 2017. That  decision  was  to  refuse  to  grant  the
    Appellant's application to enter the United Kingdom for  settlement  on
    the basis of his marriage to Ms  Harpreet  Kaur  Mahl  ("the  sponsor")
    under Appendix FM of  the  immigration  rules  and  Article  8  of  the
    European Convention on Human Rights.  The  Appellant  and  the  sponsor
    married in India on 5 April 2017 and the  sponsor  gave  birth  to  the
    couple's first child on 10 March 2019.

The Appellant's Case

 2. The Appellant's case was that  he  was  in  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    marriage with the sponsor. The Appellant entered the United Kingdom  on
    13 January 2010 on a student visa valid from 3 January  2010  until  28
    February 2013. The Appellant and sponsor first met on 20  August  2016.
    The sponsor was gainfully employed in two jobs with a  combined  income
    from both employments of approximately �24,500 per annum  and  thus  in
    excess of the minimum income requirement of �18,600. The Appellant took
    legal advice and returned voluntarily to India on 3 February 2017.  The
    couple married in India on  5  April  2017  and  remained  together  as
    husband and wife until  29  April  2017  at  which  point  the  sponsor
    returned to the United Kingdom. The sponsor has visited  the  Appellant
    on three occasions since their marriage.

The Decision at First Instance

 3.  The  Judge  indicated  the  Respondent's  reasons  for  refusing   the
    application. When the Appellant arrived in the  United  Kingdom  on  13
    January it was noted by immigration officers that the  Appellant  could
    not speak English to the required standard. His college withdrew  their
    sponsorship and it appears that the entry clearance  was  revoked.  The
    Appellant appealed against that, but his appeal was  dismissed  and  he
    became appeal rights exhausted on 24 March 2010 after which he  had  no
    right to remain in the United Kingdom. The Appellant failed to attend a
    reporting event on 15 April 2010 and was circulated as an absconder. He
    next made contact with the Home Office on 4 January 2017 when he sought
    to make a voluntary departure from the United Kingdom and illegal entry
    papers were served on him. The Appellant departed the United Kingdom on
    3 February 2017.

 4. The Respondent considered that paragraph 320 (11)  of  the  immigration
    rules applied to the Appellant. He had used deception in an immigration
    application, overstayed his leave and had been served with the  illegal
    entry papers. He had absconded from April 2010 until January 2017 which
    was considered to be aggravating circumstances. He had contrived  in  a
    significant way to circumvent the intention of the rules.

 5. The Judge noted that the Appellant's grounds of appeal were couched  in
    general terms and did not specifically address the issues raised  under
    paragraph 320 (11). The Appellant proffered a general denial of  having
    used deception. He argued that he had received bad advice from  several
    legal advisers as well as the college  where  he  went  to  pursue  his
    education. He realised he wanted to live in the United Kingdom  happily
    with his wife and knew that he would  have  to  return  voluntarily  to
    India and apply for entry clearance. The sponsor conceded  in  evidence
    that the Appellant had not attended college but did not know  why  that
    was so. She was aware that he was  unlawfully  present  in  the  United
    Kingdom.

 6. The Judge held that the couple had been introduced during  an  arranged
    marriage process and the Appellant had failed to address paragraph  320
    (11) which undermined the Appellant's credibility. Although no evidence
    was filed by the Respondent in relation to the Appellant's  immigration
    history, the  Appellant  had  not  sought  to  deny  his  conduct.  The
    Appellant  had  contrived  in  a  significant  way  to  circumvent  the
    intentions of the rules and the Respondent was entitled to  refuse  the
    application on suitability grounds under appendix FM.

 7. Considering the appeal outside the rules the Judge  accepted  that  the
    refusal resulted in an interference with  family  life,  but  both  the
    Appellant and sponsor had substantial  family  in  India.  The  sponsor
    could reasonably be expected to return to  India  to  reside  with  the
    Appellant and had said during cross examination that if the Appellant's
    appeal was refused she would return to  India  to  do  just  that.  She
    herself had only lived in the United Kingdom since 2012  when  she  had
    entered on the basis of a previous marriage. The Respondent's  decision
    was proportionate and the Judge dismissed the appeal.

The Onward Appeal

 8. The Appellant's grounds of onward appeal made  four  main  points.  The
    first was that the Judge was wrong to place the burden of proof on  the
    Appellant to show that the general grounds for  refusal  under  320(11)
    did not apply to him. By contrast the authorities,  such  as  JC  China
    [2007] UKAIT 27 stated that in relation  to  the  general  grounds  the
    burden of proof was on the  decision  maker  in  this  case  the  entry
    clearance officer. The Appellant did not have any  positive  obligation
    to disclose matters which would prejudice his case.

 9. The 2nd ground was that the Judge had failed to make a valid finding in
    relation to aggravating circumstances. If the Respondent sought to rely
    on the Appellant's failure to report that had to be established by  the
    Respondent  but  there  was  insufficient  evidence  to  prove  it  and
    therefore insufficient evidence to prove aggravating circumstances.

10. The 3rd ground noted  that  paragraph  320  (11)  was  a  discretionary
    ground. The public interest in encouraging those in the United  Kingdom
    unlawfully to return to their country had not been taken into  account.
    The Appellant had left the United  Kingdom  in  order  to  make  a  new
    application to regularise his status. All other requirements  including
    financial had been satisfied and the refusal was simply  punitive.  The
    Judge's findings at [46] were described as strange and speculative. The
    Judge had found that the Appellant had  glossed  over  his  immigration
    history between January 2010 and  January  2017  and  the  sponsor  was
    complicit in the Appellant's false representations.

11. The 4th ground argued that the appeal would have been allowed under the
    immigration rules but for the errors made by the Judge. Proportionality
    was inadequately reasoned

12. The application for permission to appeal  came  on  the  papers  before
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  Andrew  on  8  April  2019.  She  was
    satisfied that there was an arguable error of law in that the Judge may
    have shifted the burden of proof to the Appellant when it  should  have
    been with the Respondent in accordance with JC (China). She  concluded:
    "in view of this I have not gone on to consider the remaining grounds".

The Hearing Before Me

13. Counsel for the Appellant relied on the grounds of  appeal.  Grounds  1
    and 2 were said  to  be  interrelated.  There  was  no  burden  on  the
    Appellant and in the absence of evidence from the Respondent there  was
    no case for him to answer. It was not for the Appellant to apply for an
    adjournment for the Respondent  to  obtain  more  evidence.  The  Judge
    implicitly imposed the burden of proof on the Appellant when the  legal
    burden was on the  Respondent.  There  would  be  a  problem  with  the
    Appellant attempting to deny that he had overstayed as it was  accepted
    he did not have a right to be here, but  the  Respondent  also  had  to
    prove aggravating features such as absconding or  deception  and  there
    was no evidence  as  to  that  as  the  Judge  noted  at  [25]  of  the
    determination.

14.  The  Judge  had  not  considered  that  paragraph  320  (11)   was   a
    discretionary ground and the Appellant  took  issue  with  whether  the
    Judge had given a reasoned decision in terms of proportionality.  There
    were factors in the Appellant's favour which potentially  overcame  the
    public interest in the Appellant's exclusion such as that he  had  left
    voluntarily. That had  not  been  referred  to  by  the  Judge  in  the
    proportionality exercise. The Judge had adopted a punitive approach  to
    Article 8.

15. For the Respondent it was argued that the Judge had set out the reasons
    for refusal given by the entry clearance officer and  it  was  accepted
    that the Appellant was an overstayer and thus that paragraph  320  (11)
    was potentially engaged. The Appellant's witness statement had  ignored
    the Appellant's history  prior  to  meeting  the  sponsor.  Whilst  the
    evidence was sufficient to show overstaying,  the  Respondent  accepted
    that there was a material error of law  disclosed  by  the  2nd  ground
    because  the  Judge  had  not  adequately  explained  why  there   were
    aggravating circumstances as there was  no  evidence  in  support.  The
    Respondent accepted that there was merit in the 2nd ground.

Findings

16. At the conclusion of submissions, I indicated that I found there was  a
    material error of law such that I would set aside the decision at first
    instance and remit the matter back to the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  be
    reheard. It was accepted by the Respondent and found by the Judge  that
    the Appellant could meet the eligibility requirements  of  Appendix  FM
    because this was a genuine and  subsisting  marriage  and  the  sponsor
    could meet the financial requirements. The application had been refused
    under the suitability requirements which required the Appellant to  not
    fall for  refusal  under  any  of  the  general  grounds  for  refusal.
    Paragraph 320 (11) of the immigration rules is such  a  general  ground
    and as was acknowledged in the grant of permission and  submissions  to
    me the burden of proof of establishing the general ground rests on  the
    Respondent, the standard of proof being the  usual  civil  standard  of
    balance of probabilities.

17. At the First-tier Tribunal hearing the Appellant's  representative  had
    pointed out that the Respondent had not filed any documentary  evidence
    in relation to the Appellant's immigration history. The Judge relied on
    the lack of any denial of this history until a very  brief  passage  in
    his, the Appellant's, witness statement. That denial  did  not  go  far
    enough in the Judge's view because it glossed over  the  several  years
    the Appellant had spent unlawfully in the United Kingdom.

18. There were potentially aggravating circumstances in this case if  found
    to have occurred such as deception and absconding. The problem was that
    the Respondent had not filed or served any supporting  evidence  and  I
    note that the Tribunal file does not disclose a full bundle. There is a
    detailed reasons for refusal letter which runs to 3 � pages  and  there
    was an entry clearance manager's review which principally commented  on
    the sponsor's financial position which is no longer an  issue  in  this
    case. The only other document of any significance in  the  Respondent's
    bundle was the entry clearance application  which  too  is  of  limited
    assistance.

19. There may have been other documents, but they were not  in  the  bundle
    and  indeed  I  note  that  the  entry  clearance  manager  states:  "I
    acknowledge that during the consideration of the  application  some  of
    the documents provided were misplaced". This may just be a reference to
    financial documents but importantly it does appear that  there  was  an
    interview transcript in existence at  some  point  (because  the  entry
    clearance manager  refers  to  it)  but  that  document  was  not  made
    available to the First-tier Tribunal Judge even though  it  would  have
    been of considerable importance in the decision-making process.

20. Where facts and matters are not in dispute such as the  fact  that  the
    Appellant overstayed there would not be a need for  the  Respondent  to
    provide supporting evidence of overstaying. It would not be a  material
    error of law for the Judge to find as he did that  paragraph  320  (11)
    was engaged. The problem was that all the Judge had was an assertion by
    the Respondent that there  were  aggravating  circumstances  which  the
    Appellant declined to confirm. The burden was  on  the  Respondent  and
    there is force in the argument that that burden was not  discharged.  I
    agree that  it  was  not  necessary  for  Judge  Andrew  when  granting
    permission to appeal to go on to consider the other  grounds.  For  the
    Judge to proceed to dismiss the appeal given the absence of evidence to
    support the Respondent's contention that paragraph 320 (11) applied was
    a sufficient material error of law to permit me to set the decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal aside.

21. As further evidence will need to be given in this appeal I consider, in
    the light of  the  Senior  President's  Practice  Direction,  that  the
    appropriate course of action is to remit the appeal back to the  First-
    tier Tribunal to be decided afresh.  I  would  make  some  observations
    about the further evidence which would assist the First-tier. It  is  a
    matter for the Respondent  what  evidence  he  chooses  to  produce  to
    support  his  contention  that  the  Appellant  fails  the  suitability
    requirements. Evidence of absconding might be found in a  copy  of  the
    computerised CID notes or other  notes  kept  by  immigration  officers
    and/or the Respondent as they  might  have  some  details  of  on  what
    occasion or occasions the Appellant failed to sign on and when and  how
    the Appellant was listed as an absconder. Their probative  value  might
    be that they were contemporaneously compiled.

22. The refusal notice refers to the service of illegal entry papers on the
    Appellant and a copy of those papers should also be filed and served if
    available. The issue of whether there was a transcript of an  interview
    should also be clarified. I assume that it was an  interview  with  the
    Appellant not the sponsor and might be relevant. It  might  be  helpful
    for the Judge on the next occasion to have a copy of the  determination
    of the Tribunal dismissing the Appellant's appeal in 2010  referred  to
    at [18] of the determination, if available. If the Respondent  proposes
    to serve any further evidence such evidence should be filed and  served
    at least 28 days before the next hearing.

23. It is a matter for the Appellant to decide  what  further  evidence  he
    wishes to adduce. If the Respondent files and serves  further  evidence
    of the sort I outline above, a bare denial of the allegations  may  not
    be considered a sufficient response. The Appellant may wish to  file  a
    more detailed witness statement dealing with  his  immigration  history
    prior to his contact with the Home Office on 4  January  2017  when  he
    sought to make a voluntary departure from the United Kingdom. Any  such
    further evidence should be filed and served after any further  evidence
    from the Respondent preferably  14  days  before  the  remitted  appeal
    hearing.

24. As I have set the decision of the First-tier Tribunal aside  I  do  not
    propose to deal with  the  other  grounds  of  appeal  in  any  detail.
    Paragraph  320(11)  is  a  discretionary  ground.  If  the  aggravating
    circumstances were to be found the issue  would  then  be  whether  the
    Respondent had exercised discretion correctly and whether  that  should
    be reflected in any Article 8 proportionality exercise.  The  issue  of
    the proportionality of the interference with the  family  life  of  the
    Appellant and sponsor only arises if the Appellant cannot  satisfy  the
    immigration rules because in that situation  the  general  grounds  for
    refusal had been applied to him. That is a matter which will have to be
    decided at the remitted appeal hearing. If the interference with family
    life is proportionate because for example there was greater  weight  on
    the Respondent's side of the scales, that would not necessarily  be  to
    apply  a  punitive  approach  to  Article  8.  The  issue  is  one   of
    proportionality and has to be decided in the round.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
law and I set it aside. I direct that the appeal be  remitted  back  to  the
First-tier Tribunal to be reheard de novo.

Appellant's appeal allowed to that limited extent

I make no anonymity order as there is no public policy reason for so doing.
