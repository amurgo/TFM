For the Appellant:      Mr E Raw, Counsel, instructed by Jo & Co Solicitors
For the Respondent:     Mr T Melvin, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a 42 year old citizen  of  the  People's  Republic  of
    China.  She entered the United Kingdom on 9 February 2007 as the spouse
    of Mark Crowther, a British citizen.  She was granted  leave  to  enter
    until 31 January 2009.  Leave was extended  until  25  March  2011  and
    again to 21 July 2013.  A son, now 5 was born to them.  We are told and
    have no reason to doubt that in fact at the date on which her leave  to
    remain had been extended, 25 March 2011, as the spouse of  her  husband
    they had in fact separated.  He had gone to  Manchester,  taking  their
    son with him.

2.   On 10 November 2011 an application form countersigned  by  Mr  Crowther
    and signed by her applied for indefinite leave for her to remain as his
    spouse.  In section 11 of the form both of them declared that they were
    living together as husband and wife and intended to do so  permanently.
    The declaration was false as both knew.  By then he had gone to live in
    Malaga with another woman.  He had in fact already told the Home Office
    in February 2011 that he was divorcing the appellant.  He had lived  in
    Spain with their son since June 2011.

3.   On 22 February 2013 the Secretary of State  curtailed  the  appellant's
    limited leave to remain as the spouse of Mark Crowther and notified her
    of her decision to remove her under  Section  47  of  the  Immigration,
    Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 on the grounds that she had made  false
    representations and had failed to disclose material facts when applying
    for indefinite leave to remain and further that she had been  convicted
    of an offence - obtaining credit by fraud on 31 August 2012 - for which
    she had received either a short community sentence or a short suspended
    sentence.  Further, the Secretary of State concluded that she  did  not
    satisfy the requirements of Appendix FM to the newly  introduced  Rules
    effective from 9 July 2012.  There is no possible challenge to  any  of
    those reasons and none were found by First-tier Tribunal Judge Manuell,
    in his Determination and Reasons promulgated on 22 August 2013.

4.   This appeal for which permission has been  granted  by  Judge  King  is
    founded on the unusual circumstances of  the  appellant.   She  asserts
    that the decision of  the  Secretary  of  State  of  22  February  2013
    breaches her right to respect for family and  private  life,  both  for
    herself and her son and so infringes Article 8 ECHR.

5.   Unsurprisingly, in the light of the facts which we  have  recited,  the
    relationship between Mr Crowther and her and between her  and  her  son
    have given rise to proceedings in the Family Court.  Judge Manuell  was
    provided with copies of the orders of  the  Family  Court  but,  as  we
    understand it, nothing else.

6.   An important part of the reasons  given  by  Judge  King  for  granting
    permission to appeal in this case was lack of clarity  about  what  had
    occurred in the family proceedings and in particular  lack  of  clarity
    about what the Family Court had been told about the immigration  status
    and situation of the appellant.  Mr Raw who appears for her  today  has
    been unable to enlighten us, beyond the terms of the orders, about what
    occurred in the Family Court.  Against the  background  of  established
    fraud in the making of her application for indefinite leave  to  remain
    we have examined the orders of the Family Court and what we know  about
    what took place there with care.  Our purpose has been to find  out  if
    the Family Court and we  have  been  told  the  full  truth  about  the
    appellant's circumstances and indeed about what each of the two  courts
    has been told about what has been going on in the  other,  the  precise
    target of Judge King's observation when granting permission to  appeal.
    Mr Raw asserts that all of the information requested by Judge  King  is
    set out in his skeleton argument of 29 October 2013.  It is not.

7.   On 23 April 2013, that is to say two  months  and  one  day  after  the
    Secretary of State's decision  letter  against  which  the  appellant's
    appeal to the Tribunal was brought, the following  order  was  made  by
    consent.  It was ordered that the husband would make available  to  the
    appellant their son for visiting  contact  in  circumstances  in  which
    contact could be  observed  by  the  guardian.   Various  consequential
    orders were made so that when the matter came back before the court, as
    it did on 5 July before Mr Justice Keehan, a definitive  interim  order
    could be made.

8.   It is apparent from the recitals to  the  order  before  its  operative
    terms that the parties agreed that the  Courts  of  England  and  Wales
    should have exclusive jurisdiction in respect of welfare decisions  for
    the child,  the  court  being  satisfied  that  he  had  a  substantial
    connection  with  England  and  Wales  by  reference  to  his   British
    nationality but also by reference to "the  habitual  residence  of  his
    mother in England and Wales".  Paragraph 9 of the operative part of the
    order provided, "the mother shall by 7 May 2013 file and serve a letter
    from her  immigration  solicitors  addressing  (1)  the  basis  of  the
    mother's application to remain in the UK; (2) the likely timescales for
    the  determination  of  her  application;  (3)  whether  pending   such
    determination the mother can be given any travel document to enable her
    to leave and re-enter the UK so that she might travel to Spain for  the
    purposes of any contact with the child".

9.   Paragraph 10 went on to provide,  "there  will  be  permission  to  the
    parties to settle an EX.66  request  to  the  Home  Office  to  provide
    information if necessary following the receipt of the said  letter  for
    further information as to the mother's immigration application".  Given
    that the order was by consent and that  we  have  not  been  shown  any
    underlying documents presented to Mr Justice Cobb to satisfy  him  that
    it was proper to make the order we can only draw inferences as to  what
    he was told from the terms of the order.

10.  Paragraph  9  suggests  unequivocally  that  the  mother  had  made  an
    "application" to remain in the UK, determination of which was  pending.
    Subparagraph (3) suggested that her immigration status  might  be  such
    that she might have been provided by the  Home  Office  with  a  travel
    document.  In fact she knew that the  Secretary  of  State  had  on  22
    February 2013 made a decision which meant that  she  had  no  leave  to
    remain in the United Kingdom beyond that conferred upon her by  Section
    3C(2)(b) of the Immigration Act 1971 as an appellant whose  appeal  was
    pending.   Paragraph  9  cannot  have  been  honestly  drafted  if  the
    draughtsman knew that far from making an application she  had  appealed
    against the decision  which  had  removed  her  status  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  We have no reason to suspect that her family solicitors  were
    doing anything other than to fulfil their duty  to  the  family  court.
    The drafting of that paragraph therefore had to have been founded  upon
    a deception by her.

11.  Furthermore, paragraph 10 of the order plainly  implies  that  she  was
    unaware of her immigration status, hence the need to settle  a  request
    to  the  Home  Office  to  provide  information  about  "the   mother's
    immigration application".

12.  The matter then came back before Mr Justice  Keehan  on  5  July  2013.
    Again he made a consent order.  The order provided for contact to  take
    place for two hours on a date to be agreed in August and  October  2013
    in the presence of the  guardian  ad  litem  and  for  three  hours  in
    December 2013.  Thereafter, in February and in April  on  dates  to  be
    agreed unsupervised contact was to take place  of  30  minutes  on  the
    first occasion and one hour on the second.  The guardian was to prepare
    a report by 16 May 2014 and the  matter  was  then  to  be  listed  for
    further directions on 21 May 2014.  Again we do not know despite  Judge
    King's order what the  court  was  told  on  that  occasion  about  the
    mother's immigration status.  There is no basis  upon  which  we  could
    conclude that the court was told the truth.

13.  The next order made by the Family Court was made on 12 August  2013  by
    His Honour Judge Barnett.  It records that a letter was  received  from
    the appellant's solicitors, Wilson LLP  and  that  the  respondent,  Mr
    Crowther had not responded to requests for an order by consent.  It was
    ordered that permission be given for the parties to disclose  documents
    relating to the  family  proceedings  to  the  appellant's  immigration
    solicitors, Jo & Co and to the allocated Home Office Presenting Officer
    to assist  the  First-tier  Tribunal  in  determining  the  appellant's
    immigration appeal.  Nothing beyond the orders was provided.

14.  The position at which we have now arrived is therefore as follows.   We
    are invited to determine whether or not the First-tier Tribunal made an
    error of law in its determination and, if so, what decision  should  be
    taken in place of its decision to dismiss the  appeal.   We  have  been
    invited to do so in the light of family proceedings about which we have
    not been told the whole  truth.   The  documents  which  we  have  seen
    satisfy us that the Family Court itself was not told  the  truth  about
    the appellant's immigration status and proceedings.  If this  case  had
    been properly conducted by the appellant the  root  question  which  we
    would have to determine and which we will still address is  whether  or
    not the Secretary of State's decision should be  set  aside  so  as  to
    invite her to reconsider whether to grant  temporary  leave  to  remain
    while the appellant's proceedings in the Family Court  in  relation  to
    her son are  concluded.   Such  issues  are  commonplace  in  marriages
    between the spouses of different nationality and origin  when  children
    are involved.  They  can  sometimes  raise  difficult  questions.   The
    Tribunal is required to treat as a primary concern the interests of the
    child or children.  Those are all matters which in due course  we  will
    address.

15.  Judge Manuell's reasoning,  strictly  analysed,  is  open  to  possible
    criticism.  In paragraph 15 of his Determination and Reasons  he  found
    that there was no  family  life  in  the  United  Kingdom  between  the
    appellant and her son and that it had ended when  Mr  Crowther  and  he
    moved to Spain two years ago.  He treated the remote contact which  the
    appellant either had enjoyed or could enjoy from the United Kingdom  as
    part of her private life  and  concluded  correctly  that  it  was  not
    conditional on her continued residence in the United Kingdom.  He  then
    went on to consider, as an aspect of her private life, the  conduct  of
    the litigation to which we have referred and concluded, in our judgment
    correctly that it could be conducted by her remotely from China, albeit
    with greater difficulty than from within the United Kingdom.

16.  The respect in which Judge Manuell's decision may be open to  criticism
    is in his conclusion that, at the time he made his decision the contact
    which had resumed between the appellant  and  her  son  in  the  United
    Kingdom was not part of her family life.  If we had been presented,  as
    we had every right to expect, with an open and honest account  of  what
    had transpired in the family proceedings and  if  an  open  and  honest
    account had likewise been given to the Family Court then we would  have
    been faced with a difficult question but a narrow one,  namely  whether
    or not the Secretary  of  State  should  be  required  to  re-take  her
    decision so as to consider permitting the appellant to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom to enjoy the contact ordered by the Family Court and  to
    conduct her family litigation personally in the United Kingdom; but  we
    are not simply faced with such a decision.  The appellant lied  in  her
    application for indefinite leave to remain.  It  may  well  be  as  she
    maintains that she  did  so  at  the  suggestion  of  her  exploitative
    husband.  He may have duped her because he had already  told  the  Home
    Office that they were divorcing and if she is right, failed  to  fulfil
    his part of a bargain to buy out her interest in their matrimonial home
    for �3,500, but none of that excuses the basic lie.  The  Secretary  of
    State was undoubtedly entitled to curtail her leave to  remain  on  the
    grounds that she gave.  She is in effect being invited to consider this
    application outside the Immigration Rules and to exercise the  residual
    discretion which she has to permit  the  appellant  to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom for  the  limited  time  and  purpose  we  have  stated.
    However she has chosen not only to make  a  false  application  but  to
    conduct her appeals in a manner which in our judgment is abusive of the
    appellate system.  That is a factor which we are entitled to take  into
    account in the balance against her in determining whether or not  at  a
    re-hearing of her case we should overturn the decision  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal.  We refuse to do so.

17.  On the facts as we have found them  the  legitimate  interests  of  the
    United Kingdom spelt out in Article 8.2 ECHR substantially outweigh the
    right to respect for her family and private life  which  we  have  been
    able to identify.  Accordingly, and for those reasons  this  appeal  is
    dismissed.
