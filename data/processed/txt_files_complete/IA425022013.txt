                       (ANONYMITY DIRECTION NOT MADE)
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr N Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    No appearance or representation


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. On 28 October 2014 in a decision  letter  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    which was promulgated on that date, the First-tier  Tribunal  dismissed
    the appeals made by Mr Islam on three grounds but allowed that  against
    the decision to remove him under Section 47.

 2. The background is that the appellant, is a citizen of  Bangladesh.   He
    arrived in the United Kingdom on 28 January 2010 with leave as a Tier 4
    (General) Student which was valid until 30 April 2013.  On that day  he
    sought an extension of his leave. That application  was  considered  on
    the basis of the documents submitted  with  his  application  form.  He
    required a total of 40 points to be granted the  extension  under  Rule
    245ZX(a).  30 points needed to be awarded for attributes and 10  points
    for maintenance.  He was awarded 0 points for maintenance  because  the
    bank statements that he relied  upon  were  shown  to  be  false.   His
    application was, therefore, refused.  He contended also that as he  was
    in the middle of his course of study and had paid his  course  fees  he
    should not be removed. He relied in that regard on the case  of  Ahmadi
    [2012] UKUT 147.  That claim was rejected by the Tribunal.

 3. In relation to the claim against removal, the First-tier Tribunal Judge
    said, in paragraphs 6 of his decision:

         "In light of the decision  in  the  case  of  Adamally  and  Jaferi
         (Section 47 removal decisions:  Tribunal  Procedures)  [2012]  UKUT
         00414 (IAC) where the Tribunal found that removal directions  in  a
         variation case were not in accordance the law, I allow  the  appeal
         against the decision  remove the appellant under Section 47 of  the
         2006 Act."

 4. The grounds of appeal in relation to the decision say, in paragraph 2:

         "The decision to remove was made on 25 September  2013.   Therefore
         after 8 May 2013 and thus benefiting from the  amendments  made  by
         Section 51 of the Crimes  and  Courts  Act  2013  which  makes  the
         removal decision lawful."

 5. Permission to appeal was granted on 17  December  2014.   The  relevant
    paragraph says this:

         "The grounds argue that the decision to  remove  was  made  on  125
         September 2013, which is after 8 May 2013, and thus benefiting from
         the amendments made by Section 51 of  the  Crimes  and  Courts  Act
         2013, which makes the removal decision lawful.  The grounds  submit
         that in  allowing  the  appeal  under  Section  47  the  judge  has
         therefore made an error of law such that the decision should be set
         aside."

 6. The judge granting permission  was  satisfied  that  the  grounds  were
    arguable.

 7. The previous legal position was summarised in the case of Ahmadi  where
    Upper Tribunal Judge Lane said, in paragraph 19:

         "It is in accordingly without any enthusiasm that I  have  come  to
         the conclusion that Mr Malik  is,  in  substance,  correct  in  his
         submissions  regarding  the  ambit  of  Section  47  and  that  the
         respondent's current practice of including a Section 47 decision in
         the  same  decision  letter  as  that  regarding  the  refusal   or
         curtailment  of   leave   is   incompatible   with   the   relevant
         legislation."

 8. In paragraph 22 Upper Tribunal Judge Lane contemplated as follows:

         "It would clearly be possible for Parliament to amend Section 47 of
         the 2006 Act so as to enable the respondent  to  make  simultaneous
         decisions in case of the present kind.  Unless and  until  that  is
         done, however, a Section 47 decision can  be  made  only  once  the
         variation  decision  has  been  given  to  the   person   concerned
         compatibly with the  immigration notices (Regulations 2003)."

 9. Section 51 of the Crimes and Courts Act 2013 was  passed  precisely  to
    effect the change contemplated by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Lane.   That
    Section reads, where relevant:

         "(3) For Section 47(1) of the Immigration, Asylum  and  Nationality
             Act 2006 (decision that person  is  to  be  removed  from  the
             United Kingdom may be made  while  person  can  bring  appeal)
             substitute -

               i) Where the Secretary of State gives written notice of a pre-
                  removal decision to the person affected, the Secretary  of
                  State may,

                   a) In the document containing that notice,

                   b) In a document enclosed in the same envelope  as  that
                      document,

                   c) Otherwise on the occasion when that notice  is  given
                      to the person, or

                   d) At any time after that occasion but before an  appeal
                      against the pre-removal  decision  is  brought  under
                      Section 82(1) of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
                      Asylum Act 2002, also give the person written  notice
                      that the person is to  be  removed  from  the  United
                      Kingdom  under  this  Section  in   accordance   with
                      directions given by an  Immigration  Officer  if  and
                      when the person's leave to enter  or  remain  in  the
                      United Kingdom expires."

10. It follows that after 8 May 2013 when the amended Section  was  brought
    into effect, the Secretary of State was quite entitled to give a person
    written notice of removal from the United Kingdom at the same  time  as
    giving written notice of a pre-removal decision.  That is what  he  did
    here on 25 September 2013.  As a result  without  any  hesitation  this
    appeal is allowed.
