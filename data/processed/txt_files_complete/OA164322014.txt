                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge M Whalan, promulgated on 30th September 2015, following a hearing
    at Taylor House on 4th September 2015.  In the determination, the judge
    allowed the appeal of Miss Khadija Sikandar, whereupon  the  Respondent
    Entry Clearance Officer, subsequently applied  for,  and  was  granted,
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal, and thus the  matter  comes
    before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan, a female, and she was  born  on
    12th  February  1986.   She  appealed  against  the  decision  of   the
    Respondent Entry Clearance Officer dated 18th November  2014,  refusing
    her application for a spouse visa to join her husband, Dr Hasnat Ali, a
    British citizen, living in the United Kingdom.

The Judge's Findings

 3. The judge had regard to the fact that following  the  decision  of  the
    Entry Clearance Officer on 18th November 2014, there was a review  that
    was carried out by the Entry Clearance Manager on  9th  February  2015,
    and, accordingly it was accepted in the review that the Appellant  "had
    filed properly various documents stated to be missing in  the  original
    notice".  These were (1) tax returns for 2013 to 2014; (2) accounts for
    2015/2014; (3) SA302 for 2012 to 2013; (4) class 2  national  insurance
    bill which has been stamped  as  paid;  and  (5)  twelve  months'  bank
    statements for 2013 to 2014.  Despite this, as the judge observed,  the
    Respondent continued to  assert  that  the  Appellant  had  "still  not
    provided the SA302 for 2013 to 2014 or any of this which would show the
    amount of tax payable by the Sponsor for the 2013/2014 financial year".
     Accordingly, the appeal was said  not  to  meet  the  requirements  of
    Appendix FM-SE, paragraph 7(a) and 7(b)(ii).

 4. The judge went on to record the evidence of the Appellant's  sponsoring
    husband, Dr Ali, who "was pretty clear during the oral hearing that the
    Appellant had in fact filed all the relevant documentation, or at least
    most of it, at the time of the  substantive  application".   (Paragraph
    7).  The judge did not determine this issue, however.

 5. At the hearing on 4th September 2015, the  Presenting  Officer,  before
    Judge Whalan, was able to look at the additional documentation supplied
    and this "concerned specifically an HMRC  document  dated  20th  August
    2015 which referred to the fact that Dr Ali had paid �3,024.33  to  his
    self-assessment account in September 2015".  The judge held  that,  "it
    is clear from this document that with this claimant, Dr  Ali's  account
    is up-to-date".  (Paragraph 8).  The judge went on to note that Dr  Ali
    was a dental surgeon trading as Crystal Dental Practice, in a  business
    with a turnover of �300,000, whereby his own salary was �23,289 to 31st
    March 2014 and �30,725 to  31st  March  2013,  but  which  nevertheless
    satisfied  adequately  the   �18,600   threshold   of   the   financial
    requirements in Appendix FM (see paragraph 9).

 6. The appeal was allowed.





Grounds of Application

 7. The grounds of application  state  that  the  judge  erred  in  law  in
    allowing the appeal on the basis of documents  and  evidence  submitted
    after the date of  the  decision  contrary  to  what  was  required  in
    Appendix FM.

 8. On 6th April 2016 permission to appeal was granted.

Submissions

 9. At the hearing before me on 20th  May  2016,  Mr  Tufan,  appearing  on
    behalf of the Respondent  Entry  Clearance  Officer,  stated  that  the
    correct date for determination of the evidence  was  the  date  of  the
    application.  It was not the date of the hearing.  It  was  not  enough
    even to submit evidence before the Entry  Clearance  Manager's  review.
    All the evidence had  to  be  in  with  the  application  itself.   The
    Appellant could not  have  succeeded  under  the  Rules.   The  correct
    approach for him was now to make a new application.

10. For his part, Mr Atsham Ali, who appeared as McKenzie  friend  for  the
    Appellant as her brother-in-law, stated that there was no error of law.
     In submissions that were lucid, comprehensive, and attractively  made,
    Mr Ali stated that the 2013 to 2014 tax return was  with  the  original
    decision maker.  The certified accounts were with the original decision
    maker.  The only thing that was missing was  the  SA302  document,  and
    this was not provided quite simply because it had to be produced by the
    HMRC, and at the date of the application itself, HMRC had not  produced
    this document.

11. Second, and no less importantly,  what  the  Rules  require  is  for  a
    statement of accounts.  There is no requirement that  these  should  be
    the current accounts.  There is no requirement that these should be the
    most recent accounts.  The Appellant, or  any  other  applicant,  could
    only submit that which was available from the HMRC.  If  the  HMRC  had
    not produced as yet the requisite SA302, but  only  did  so  after  the
    application  had  been  made,  then  the  applicant  was  justified  in
    explaining why he could not have produced it, provided he produced what
    he was able to produce from that office.  This is what he had done.

12. Third, it was quite clear that the Appellant was reasonably entitled to
    rely on such evidence because what the SA302 referred to was the amount
    of  �6,027.63  and  this  was  exactly  the  figure  that  had  already
    previously been disclosed to the Respondent Entry Clearance Officer  in
    terms of the information from the Appellant  himself  at  the  relevant
    time.  Mr Ali also stated that he was not  happy  with  the  suggestion
    that it was always open to the Appellant to make  another  application,
    because this was an application that had been made in  2014,  and  some
    two and a half years had gone by, after which there was still a refusal
    that the Appellant was now having to appeal.  Delays of that  magnitude
    could not be viewed with equanimity.

13. Finally, in an impressive submission, Mr Ali took me to the guidance on
    Appendix FM-SE.  He submitted that the Rules here could be  divided  up
    into three separate categories.  First,  there  were  cases  where  the
    Entry Clearance Officer  could  "reconsider  documents  that  had  been
    submitted with the application" and this is set out at Section D.  Some
    of these would include cases where "sequence  of  documents"  had  been
    missing or where "a document is in the wrong  format".   Second,  there
    was a situation  where  the  Respondent  Entry  Clearance  Officer  had
    discretion as to whether or not to give consideration to matters as yet
    not before the receiving  authority.   This  was  set  out  at  Section
    D(b)(ii) and it  applied  where  an  applicant  "has  not  submitted  a
    specified document, the decision maker may contact the applicant or his
    representative in writing or otherwise and request the documents  ...".
    Thirdly, there was a situation  set  out  at  Section  D(c)  where  the
    "decision maker will not request documents where he  or  she  does  not
    anticipate that addressing the error or omission referred to  ...  will
    lead to a grant because the application  would  be  refused  for  other
    reasons".

14. On this basis, Mr Ali submitted that, given that the only document that
    was missing was SA302, the decision maker  should  have  exercised  his
    discretion to contact the Appellant and request the necessary  document
    because the use of the word "may contact the applicant" was designed to
    serve precisely that purpose and it was a provision in  the  Rule  that
    was meant to be employed to this effect and a failure to so exercise  a
    discretion by a decision maker could not be overlooked because to do so
    would be to frustrate the purposes of the Rules which were  not  always
    designed to look  only  at  documents  that  were  submitted  with  the
    application and exclude consideration of all else that  followed  after
    it.

15. In reply, Mr Tufan submitted that the fact here was that  the  relevant
    documents were not submitted.  The judge had alluded to the  fact  that
    some of the documents still had not been submitted at  paragraph  7  of
    the determination, and were only submitted at the hearing.  The  appeal
    could not have been allowed.

No Error of Law

16. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1)  of
    TCEA 2007) such that I should set aside the decision.  My  reasons  are
    as follows.  This is a case where the judge  recorded  that  the  Entry
    Clearance Manager had "accepted in the review that  the  Appellant  had
    filed properly various documents stated to be missing in  the  original
    notice" (paragraph 6).  These documents included  the  tax  return  for
    2013 and 2014 as well as the tax accounts for 2013 and 2014.  What  was
    missing was the SA302  for  2013  to  2014.   The  judge  observed  (at
    paragraph 6) that, "the Entry Clearance Officer still could continue to
    assert" that the Appellant had "still not provided the SA302  for  2013
    to 2014 or any evidence which would show the amount of tax  payable  by
    the Sponsor for the 2013 to 2014 financial year".

17. It is plain that the failure was only to submit the SA302 for  2013  to
    2014 (which was not at the time of the application available) could not
    have been fatal to the application at the date of the consideration  by
    the decision maker because the decision maker had also  other  evidence
    "which could show the amount of tax payable" and  this  other  evidence
    included two substantial pieces of evidence, namely, the tax return for
    2013 to 2014 and the tax accounts for 2013 to 2014.

18. Second, an in any event, had there been any doubt in relation  to  this
    the provisions of Appendix  FM-SE  could  have  been  utilised  by  the
    decision  maker,  particularly  in  circumstances   where   these   two
    substantial pieces of evidence were available for consideration by  the
    decision maker, to "contact the applicant  or  his  representative"  to
    ascertain the availability of further evidence.

19. But more importantly  still,  the  decision  maker  had  an  obligation
    whereby he could "reconsider documents that had been submitted with the
    application" and the submission of  these  two  substantial  pieces  of
    evidence was something that had to be considered, following  which,  it
    is difficult to see how, on a balance of probabilities, the application
    could have been refused.

20. In the circumstances, Judge Whalan reached the right decision  and  one
    that  was  open  to  him  on  a  balance  of  probabilities  under  the
    Immigration Rules.

Notice of Decision

There is no material error of law in the  original  judge's  decision.   The
