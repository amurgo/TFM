                                                                   Appellant
                                     and


               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This appeal was determined on the papers by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Foudy.  On application, permission  to  appeal  to  this  Tribunal  was
    granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Scott Baker.  It is far from clear
    which of the grounds identified by Judge Scott  Baker  are  in  reality
    viable on the facts of the case and on the basis of the  papers  before
    Judge Foudy.

 2. Subsequent developments are summarised  in  a  letter  I  sent  to  the
    parties on 26 August 2016.  B S Singh & Co, solicitors, replied to  say
    that they would prefer fresh consideration of the appeal in the  First-
    tier Tribunal, but, this time, at an oral hearing.  There has  been  no
    response from the respondent.

 3. There appears to be agreement that the grounds, or some  of  them,  are
    made out.  In the circumstances I am content to find error  of  law  in
    Judge Foudy's decision (which  certainly  does  feature  the  omissions
    mentioned by Judge Scott Baker) and set it aside.

 4. I direct that  the  appeal  be  considered  afresh  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  Only the fee for determination without  a  hearing  in  that
    Tribunal has been paid.  If the appellant now intends to  withdraw  his
    consent to determination without a hearing, article 3(4) of the  First-
    tier Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Fees  Order  2011  would
    appear to apply, as the solicitors' letter accepts.
