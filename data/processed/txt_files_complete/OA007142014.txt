                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Adio, promulgated on 4th December 2014, following the hearing  at
    Hatton Cross on 17th November 2014.  In the  determination,  the  judge
    allowed the appeal of Hem Kumari Pahim.   The  Respondent  subsequently
    for, and was granted, permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal,  and
    thus the matter comes before me.





The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a female, a citizen of Nepal, who  was  born  on  25th
    August 1979.  She appealed against the decision of the Respondent dated
    3rd December 2013 to refuse her entry clearance to join her  mother  as
    an adult dependant.  The application was considered under paragraph EC-
    DR1.1 of Appendix FM.  The Respondent's view was  that  there  were  no
    instructions to Entry Clearance Officers to consider adult children  of
    ex-Gurkha widows under  any  discretionary  criteria.   The  Respondent
    decided that the Appellant had not shown she is required due to, either
    age, illness or disability, long-term personal care to perform everyday
    tasks for her mother in the UK.  Second, the Respondent  was  also  not
    satisfied that the Appellant would be maintained  and  accommodated  by
    her mother without recourse  to  public  funds.   The  application  was
    rejected.

The Judge's Findings

 3. The judge recounted the facts.  He observed how the  Sponsor's  husband
    had been  discharged  from  the  army  in  1959  before  the  Sponsor's
    marriage.  The Sponsor, Mrs Dhan Meyaa Limbu, then  had  her  daughter,
    Hem Kumari Pahim, born to her in 1979.  This was twenty years after her
    husband's discharge.  Her husband then died when he was 81  years  old.
    Since that time, the Sponsor and the daughter have been very close.  In
    fact, they had been living together (see paragraph 5).

 4. When the Sponsor came to the UK, her daughter, the Appellant,  did  not
    come with her.  She was not allowed to do  so.   However,  the  Sponsor
    speaks to her daughter "most of the time  every  week"  (paragraph  6).
    Her daughter is well and is studying a  Masters  degree.   It  was  the
    Sponsor who paid for the Appellant's  Masters  degree  programme.   The
    Appellant is living with a relative.  Indeed, "her daughter  is  paying
    for rent and studying in Nepal" (paragraph 6).

 5. The judge found that the Sponsor had  made  it  clear  that  there  are
    regular payments made to her daughter through her Nepalese account  and
    that the Sponsor was credible (paragraph 15).  The judge had regard  to
    the well established authorities  of  Gurung  [2013]  EWCA  Civ  8  and
    Ghising [2012] UKUT 00160.  The case  of  Gurung  made  it  clear  that
    ultimately the question of whether an individual enjoys family life  is
    one of fact and depends on a careful consideration of all the  relevant
    facts.  The judge held that,

         "In the present case, the only time  that  the  Appellant  and  her
         mother has spent apart has been between 2011 and the  present  time
         when the Sponsor has been settled  in  the  UK.   Furthermore,  the
         Sponsor has been back to her daughter in Nepal even though she only
         spent thirteen days with her but gave a credible  reason  to  avoid
         paying double rent  ....   I  find  that  the  Appellant  is  still
         financially dependent on the Sponsor and there are  emotional  ties
         between both of them.  The Sponsor has stated that  she  calls  her
         daughter most of the time" (paragraph 17).

 6. The judge went on to hold that there were only three years in which the
    Sponsor and the Appellant had not lived together and that the voluntary
    separation between them cannot itself indicate that there is no  family
    life in existence (paragraph 18).  In concluding, the judge  held  that
    the decision of the Respondent "would prevent  the  Appellant  and  her
    mother living together under the same roof on a  daily  basis  as  they
    were living before the Sponsor came to the UK in 2008" (paragraph  19).



 7. This  was  a  case  where  the  courts  had  routinely  emphasised  the
    importance of rectifying a "historic injustice" with respect to Gurkhas
    and this consideration is an important factor to be taken into  account
    in the balancing exercise (paragraph 20).

 8. This was also a case where the Appellant's father

         "served with the British military for fifteen years and he  has  an
         exemplary record.  He was also decorated with medals.  His wife has
         been allowed to settle in the UK as the only  remaining  member  of
         the family but for the historic wrong the daughter also would  have
         been in a position to settle with her  mother  and  father  if  the
         father was alive  and  opted  to  settle  in  the  United  Kingdom"
         (paragraph 21).

    The appeal was allowed.

Grounds of Application

 9. The grounds of application state that the judge failed to apply Section
    117B of the 2002 Act as amended.   Furthermore,  the  judge  failed  to
    determine that  the  Appellant  would  be  financially  independent  as
    required by the latest public interest considerations.

10. On 26th January 2015, permission to appeal was granted.

Submissions

11. At the hearing before me on 2nd March 2015, Mr Whitwell,  appearing  on
    behalf of the Respondent, Entry Clearance Officer, submitted that there
    were four Grounds of Appeal originally,  but  that  on  reflection,  he
    would have to withdraw two of these.   First,  it  is  made  clear  (at
    paragraph 12 of the sponsoring mother's witness statement) that had her
    husband been able to apply earlier, he would have done so,  at  a  time
    when their daughter was under 18.  Therefore, Ground 4 would have to be
    withdrawn insofar as it suggest that there  is  no  historic  injustice
    here.  Second, Ground 1 would also have  to  be  withdrawn  because  it
    suggests that there is no family life constituted,  given  that  normal
    emotional ties are to be expected in  such  cases  anyway.   That  left
    grounds two and three.

12. Ground 2 states that the judge was wrong to uphold  (at  paragraph  17)
    that "the Appellant is still financially  dependent  on  the  Sponsor".
    However, the question of  "financial  independence"  as  explicated  in
    Section 117B, has recently been visited by the Tribunal in Dube  [2014]
    UKUT 90, and that case has made it clear that, provided that the  judge
    refers  to  the  relevant  considerations,   it   is   unnecessary   to
    specifically refer to the statutory provisions of the amended 2002 Act,
    in relation to the public  interest  considerations.   Therefore,  this
    ground also could not be taken any further.  That  left  Ground  3  and
    this was important because in the application  (at  question  2.9)  the
    Appellant had said that there was an income of ï¿½400 per month, but this
    was in the form of a pension credit for the sponsoring mother and there
    was no evidence of what the outgoings were of the mother to enable  the
    judge to conclude that the parties would be financially independent.

13. For his part, Mr Richardson submitted  that  the  suggestion  that  the
    Appellant  may  have  been  financially  independent   in   Nepal   was
    misconceived.  It was  misconceived  because  it  was  based  upon  the
    misreading of the judge's statement that, "her daughter is  paying  for
    rent and studying in Nepal" (paragraph 6).  The fact that the  daughter
    was paying rent did not mean that the daughter had  independent  means.
    This was because paragraph 6 had to be read as a whole and this made it
    clear that, "the  Sponsor  paid  for  the  Appellant's  Masters  degree
    programme" (paragraph 6).  Accordingly, it was clear that the Appellant
    was essentially dependent upon her sponsoring mother.

No Error of Law

14. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1)  of
    TCEA 2007) such that I should set aside the decision.  First, the  case
    of Dube [2015] UKUT 90 makes it clear that Section 117A to Section 117D
    does not represent any kind of radical departure from  the  established
    jurisprudence on Article 8.  What these provisions do is to make a case
    for the need for a structured approach.  It is  also  made  clear  that
    judges are duty bound to have regard to  the  specified  considerations
    and specific enumeration of the provisions is not necessary.   In  this
    case, it was clear that the judge did do so.

15. The Judge was clear that,  "the  Sponsor  is  also  on  pension  credit
    evidence of which was provided before me" (paragraph 19).  There was no
    suggestion that there was any issue of financial  independence  arising
    from this.

16. Second, the judge applied the case law in a meticulous manner, and made
    findings of fact that are beyond reproach.  For example, the judge held
    that it was only for three years that the Sponsor and the Appellant had
    not lived together, (paragraph 18), but  that  otherwise  there  was  a
    subsisting family life  between  them,  and  that  the  affect  of  the
    decision of the Respondent "would prevent the Appellant and the  mother
    living together under the same roof on  a  daily  basis  as  they  were
    living before the Sponsor came to the UK in 2008" (paragraph 19).

17. Proper consideration was given to  the  requirement  giving  regard  to
    "historic  injustice"  (paragraph  20).   Issues  of  integration  into
    society, which are relevant under the new public  interest  provisions,
    were  specifically  considered  (paragraph  21).   The  judge  properly
    concluded that,

         "the Sponsor is quite elderly and the closest relative she  has  to
         her is her daughter who she has been very close to since the  death
         of her husband.  She makes it clear in her witness  statement  that
         to deny her daughter entry would be denying her the family  support
         from the only daughter which she cherishes and treasures the  most"
         (paragraph 22).

    These findings were perfectly open to the judge.

Notice of Decision
