Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr I Richards, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    No representative


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 (SI 2008/2698) I  make  an  anonymity  order.   Unless  the  Upper
    Tribunal or Court directs otherwise, no  report  of  these  proceedings
    shall directly or  indirectly  identify  the  respondent  (OJE).   This
    direction applies to both the appellant and to  the  respondent  and  a
    failure to comply with this direction could lead to Contempt  of  Court
    proceedings.

 2. Although this is an appeal by the Secretary of State, for convenience I
    will refer to the  parties  as  they  appeared  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

Background

 3. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria who was  born  in  the  UK  on  9
    December 1988.  He has lived his entire life in the  UK.   His  parents
    are Nigerian and they have lived in the UK since the 1980s.

 4. The appellant's mother, together with the appellant and his siblings as
    dependents,  were  subject   to   a   deportation   order   which   was
    unsuccessfully appealed against in May 1998.  Nothing appears  to  have
    happened thereafter to remove the family.

 5. On 10 August 1999, the appellant's mother applied for indefinite  leave
    to remain for herself, her children and her  partner.   On  6  December
    2002, the Secretary of State granted the appellant and his family ILR.

 6. The appellant has been convicted of criminal offences on  a  number  of
    occasions.

 7. In March 2006 he pleaded guilty at the Ipswich Crown Court to a  number
    of offences including the possession of Class A drugs  (crack  cocaine)
    with intent to supply and two offences  concerning  the  possession  of
    weapons.  He was sentenced to a two-year Detention and Training  Order.



 8. On 8 September 2010,  at  the  Central  Kent  Magistrates'  Court,  the
    appellant was convicted of possession of a  Class  A  controlled  drug,
    namely crack cocaine and  failure  to  surrender  to  custody  and  was
    sentenced to a fine of �100.

 9. On 9 September 2010 at the South-West Essex Magistrates' Court  he  was
    again convicted of possession of a  Class  A  controlled  drug,  namely
    heroin and failure to surrender to custody and was fined �200.

10. On 2 March 2011, the appellant was sentenced, following a guilty  plea,
    at the Maidstone Crown Court on five counts:  three  counts  of  supply
    either of heroin or crack cocaine  and  two  counts  of  possession  of
    heroin or crack cocaine with intent to supply.  He was sentenced  to  a
    period of four and a half years'  imprisonment  concurrently  on  those
    accounts.

11. It would appear that the  appellant  was  released  from  prison  on  8
    February 2013.  Shortly thereafter, on 10 April 2013 the appellant  was
    arrested whilst driving a car and found to be in possession of a  small
    amount of cocaine.  On 12 April 2013, at the North London  Magistrates'
    Court  he  was  convicted,  in  relation  to  this  last  incident,  of
    possessing a Class A controlled drug, namely cocaine and fined �100. He
    was recalled to  prison  for  breach  of  his  licence  conditions  and
    subsequently released in November 2013.

12. On 10 November 2014, the appellant was notified that he was  liable  to
    be deported pursuant to the automatic deportation provisions in the  UK
    Borders Act 2007 and invited to make representation why he  should  not
    be deported.

13.  On  25  November  2014,   the   appellant   returned   the   completed
    questionnaire.  The representations  relied  upon  the  fact  that  the
    appellant had been born in the UK and had lived his whole life  in  the
    UK having never travelled abroad and visited Nigeria.

14. On 29 January 2015, the Secretary of State,  treating  the  appellant's
    representation as a human rights claim, refused his  claim  based  upon
    Art 8 of the ECHR.

The Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

15. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.

16. At that appeal hearing, the appellant was unrepresented.  He  continued
    to rely upon the fact that he was born in the UK and had not  left  the
    UK.  He also claimed that he had  no  contact  with  any  relatives  in
    Nigeria.  Although his mother had siblings  there,  he  had  never  met
    them. In addition, he relied  upon  his  relationship  with  a  British
    citizen, "CH".  Their relationship had begun following his release from
    prison in November 2013.  She has two children, a boy ("S") born on  28
    August 2009 and a girl ("T") born on 29 April 2012.  In  addition,  the
    appellant and CH have a daughter ("N") born on 27 February 2015.

17. Judge R E Barrowclough allowed the  appellant's  appeal  under  Art  8.
    Although the judge accepted that the  appellant  did  not  fall  within
    Exceptions 1 and 2 in s.117C(4) and (5) of the Nationality, Immigration
    and Asylum  Act  2002  ("NIA  Act  2002"),  Judge  Barrowclough  found,
    applying s.117C(6), that there were "very compelling circumstances"  to
    outweigh the public  interest  in  the  appellant's  deportation  as  a
    foreign criminal.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

18. The Secretary of  State  sought  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal on a number of grounds.

19. First, the judge had wrongly applied s.117C(6).  He was wrong  to  find
    that there were "very compelling circumstances over  and  above"  those
    recognised in Exceptions 1 and 2 when the judge had found that  neither
    Exception 1 nor Exception 2 was satisfied.

20. Secondly, the judge's factual findings in the appellant's  favour  were
    contrary  to  the  judge's  finding  that  the  appellant  was  not  "a
    particularly convincing or reliable witness".

21. Thirdly, the  appellant's  circumstances  could  not  amount  to  "very
    compelling circumstances" over and above those described in  Exceptions
    1 and 2 in s.117C(4) and (5).

22. Finally, the judge failed to have proper regard to the three facets  of
    the public interest set out in OH (Serbia) v SSHD [2008] EWCA  Civ  694
    and to the risk that the appellant would re-offend in the future.

23. On 24 March 2016, the First-tier Tribunal (Judge  Colyer)  granted  the
    Secretary of State permission to appeal.

The Submissions

24. Mr Richards, who represented the  Secretary  of  State  relied  on  the
    grounds.  He placed emphasis on the fact that the judge had found  that
    the appellant did not come within Exception 1 in s.117C(4) based on his
    private life as he had not been lawfully resident in the UK for most of
    his life.  Further, the judge had found that the appellant did not come
    within Exception 2 in s.117C(5) dealing  with  the  appellant's  family
    life in the UK with his partner and children on the basis that  it  had
    not been established that  it  would  be  "unduly  harsh"  if  he  were
    deported.   Mr  Richards  submitted  that  having  found  that  neither
    exception applied, it would only be very exceptionally that it could be
    established that there were "very compelling  circumstances"  over  and
    above those recognised in the exceptions.  Mr Richards  submitted  that
    the judge failed properly to consider the "over and above" element  and
    had thereby misdirected himself in law.

25. Further, Mr Richards submitted that the judge was wrong  to  find  that
    there were "very compelling circumstances" and, in particular,  he  had
    taken into account (at [17] and [19]) that it would  be  artificial  to
    treat the appellant as a "foreign criminal" because he had been in  the
    UK all his life.  Mr Richards submitted that the appellant fell  within
    the definition of "foreign criminal" in s.117D(2) of the NIA  Act  2002
    and there was nothing artificial in treating him as falling within  the
    category as defined by statute.  He submitted  that  the  determination
    was safe and should be set aside.

26.  The  appellant,  who  was  not  represented,  reminded   me   of   his
    circumstances and in particular that he had lived in the UK his  entire
    life and of his family life with his partner, CH and her  two  children
    and their child N.

Discussion

27. There is no doubt that the appellant, as a result of his conviction for
    drugs offences in 2011, is a "foreign criminal" as defined in s.117D(2)
    of the NIA Act 2002 as he  is  not  a  British  citizen  and  has  been
    sentenced to a period of imprisonment of at least twelve  months.   His
    deportation, therefore, can only be resisted, so  far  as  relevant  to
    him, if he is able to establish that his deportation would be  contrary
    to the ECHR, in particular Art 8 (see s.33(2)(a) of the UK Borders  Act
    2007).

28. The relevant Immigration Rule (in HC 395 as amended) is para 398  which
    provides that:

         "Where a person claims that their deportation would be contrary  to
         the  UK's  obligations  under  Article  8  of  the   Human   Rights
         Convention, and

         (a) the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive  to  the
         public good and in the  public  interest  because  they  have  been
         convicted of an offence for which they have  been  sentenced  to  a
         period of imprisonment of at least 4 years; ....

         the Secretary of  State  in  assessing  that  claim  will  consider
         whether paragraph 399 or 399A applies and,  if  it  does  not,  the
         public interest in deportation will only  be  outweighed  by  other
         factors where there are  very  compelling  circumstances  over  and
         above those described in paragraphs 399 and 399A."

29. In fact, neither para 399 (dealing with family  law  issues)  nor  para
    399A (dealing with private life issues) applies to the appellant.  They
    only apply where the sentence of imprisonment is less than four  years.
    Therefore, by virtue of para 398, the appellant  must  establish  "very
    compelling circumstances over and above those described  in  paragraphs
    399 and 399A" (my emphasis).  Even though the appellant cannot  succeed
    under either of those paragraphs, it  is,  nevertheless,  important  to
    consider their terms in order  to  determine  whether  very  compelling
    circumstances "over and above" them are establsihed.

30. Family life is dealt with in  para  399  which,  so  far  as  relevant,
    provides as follows:

         "This paragraph applies where paragraph 398(b) or (c) applies if -

         (a)  The person has a genuine and subsisting parental  relationship
             with a child under the age of 18 years who is in the UK, and

             (i)  the child is a British Citizen;

                  ...; and ...

                  (a)  it would be unduly harsh for the child to live in the
                      country to which the person is to be deported; and

                  (b)  it would be unduly harsh for the child to  remain  in
                      the UK without the person who is to be deported; or

         (b)  The person has a genuine and subsisting  relationship  with  a
             partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen  or  settled
             in the UK; and

             (i)  the relationship was formed at a  time  when  the  person
                  (deportee) was in the UK lawfully  and  their  immigration
                  status was not precarious; and

             (ii)     it would be unduly harsh for that partner to live  in
                  the country to which the person is to be deported, because
                  of compelling circumstances over and above those described
                  in paragraph EX.2. of Appendix FM; and

             (iii)    it would be unduly harsh for that partner  to  remain
                  in the UK without the person who is to be deported."

31. Paragraph EX.2. of Appendix FM states that:

         "For the purposes of paragraph EX.1.(b) 'insurmountable  obstacles'
         means the very significant difficulties which would be faced by the
         applicant or their partner in continuing their family life together
         outside the UK and which could not be overcome or would entail very
         serious hardship for the applicant or their partner."

32. Private life is dealt with in para 399A which provides as follows:

         "This paragraph applies where paragraph 398(b) or (c) applies if -

         (a)  the person has been lawfully resident in the UK  for  most  of
             his life; and

         (b)  he is socially and culturally integrated in the UK; and

         (c)  there would be very significant obstacles to  his  integration
             into the country to which it is proposed he is deported."

33. Of course, as I have already indicated, the appellant  because  he  has
    been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of at least four years  must
    show "very compelling circumstances over and above" those  set  out  in
    para 399 and 399A.

34. The provisions in the Rules are, in large measure, mirrored in Part  5A
    of the NIA Act 2002 which applies  to  the  Tribunal  when  determining
    whether a breach of Art 8 has been established on the  basis  that  any
    interference  with  an  individual's  private   or   family   life   is
    disproportionate.  Section 117A requires the Tribunal to "have  regard"
    for the factors listed  in  s.117B  (general  application)  and  s.117C
    (applicable in deportation cases).

35. The relevant provisions are in s.117C(1), (2), (4), (5) and (6).

36. Section 117C(1) states that:

         "The deportation of foreign criminals is in the public interest."

37. Section s.117C(2) continues:

         "The more serious the offence committed by a foreign criminal,  the
         greater is the public interest in deportation of the criminal."

38. Section 117C(6) states that:

         "In the case of a foreign criminal who  has  been  sentenced  to  a
         period of imprisonment of at least four years, the public  interest
         requires   deportation   unless   there   are    very    compelling
         circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions  1  and
         2."

39. That is the equivalent of para 398(a) of the Rules.

40. Exception 1 is in s.117C(4) and is as follows:

         "Exception 1 applies where -

         (a)  C has been lawfully resident in the United Kingdom for most of
             C's life,

         (b)  C is socially and culturally integrated in the United Kingdom,
             and

         (c)  There would be very significant obstacles to  C's  integration
             into the country which C is proposed to be deported."

41. That mirrors para 399A  of  the  Rules  dealing  with  an  individual's
    private life.

42. Exception 2 is dealt with in s.117C(5) as follows:

         "Exception  2  applies  where  C  has  a  genuine  and   subsisting
         relationship with a qualifying partner, or a genuine and subsisting
         parental relationship with a qualifying child, and  the  effect  of
         C's deportation on the partner or child would be unduly harsh."

43. Although not worded precisely  in  the  same  way,  in  substance  that
    provision mirrors para 399(a) and (b) of the Rules.

44. The  Art  8  rules,  unlike  s.117C,  do  not  technically  govern  the
    determination of appeals against deportation decisions made pursuant to
    the UK Borders Act 2007 (see Ali (Iraq) v SSHD [2016] UKSC 60).

45. The important point to note in the case of an individual who  is  being
    deported having been sentenced to a period  of  at  least  four  years'
    imprisonment is that falling within Exception 1 or 2 is not  sufficient
    to establish that the public interest is outweighed by the individual's
    circumstances.  Only "very compelling circumstances"  which  are  "over
    and above" those identified in Exceptions 1 or 2 will suffice.

46. The meaning of the phrase  "very  compelling  circumstances,  over  and
    above those described in Exceptions 1 and  2"  was  considered  by  the
    Court of Appeal in NA (Pakistan) v SSHD [2016] EWCA Civ 662.   In  that
    case,  the  Court  of  Appeal  concluded  that  the  "very   compelling
    circumstances" category applied not only to the "serious offender"  who
    had been convicted of an offence of at least four years but also to the
    "medium offender" who had been sentenced to a  period  of  imprisonment
    between twelve months and  four  years  but  who  could  not  meet  the
    requirements of Exception 1 or Exception 2.  At  [28]-[33],  delivering
    the judgment of the court, Jackson LJ said this:

         "28. The next question which arises concerns the meaning  of  'very
             compelling circumstances, over and above  those  described  in
             Exceptions 1 and 2'.  The new para. 398 uses the same language
             as  section  117C(6).    It   refers   to   'very   compelling
             circumstances, over and above those  described  in  paragraphs
             399 and 399A.'  Paragraphs 399 and  399A  of  the  2014  rules
             refer to the same subject matter as  Exceptions  1  and  2  in
             section 117C, but they do so in greater detail.

         29.  In our view, the reasoning  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  JZ
             (Zambia) applies to those  provisions.   The  phrase  used  in
             section 117C(6), in para. 398 of the 2014 rules and  which  we
             have held is to be read in section 117C(3) does not mean  that
             a  foreign   criminal   facing   deportation   is   altogether
             disentitled from seeking to rely on matters falling within the
             scope of the circumstances described in  Exceptions  1  and  2
             when seeking  to  contend  that  'there  are  very  compelling
             circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions  1
             and 2'.  As we have indicated above,  a  foreign  criminal  is
             entitled to rely upon such matters, but he would  need  to  be
             able to point to features of his case of a kind  mentioned  in
             Exceptions 1 and 2 (and in paras. 399  or  399A  of  the  2014
             rules),  or  features  falling   outside   the   circumstances
             described in those Exceptions and those paragraphs, which made
             his claim based on Article 8 especially strong.

         30.  In  the  case  of  a  serious  offender  who  could  point  to
             circumstances  in  his  own  case  which  could  be  said   to
             correspond to the circumstances described in Exceptions 1  and
             2, but where he could only just succeed in such  an  argument,
             it  would  not  be  possible  to  describe  his  situation  as
             involving very compelling circumstances, over and above  those
             described in Exceptions 1 and 2.  One might describe that as a
             bare case of the kind described in Exceptions 1 or 2.  On  the
             other hand, if he could point to  factors  identified  in  the
             descriptions of Exceptions 1 and 2 of an especially compelling
             kind in support of an Article 8 claim, going well beyond  what
             would be necessary to  make  out  a  bare  case  of  the  kind
             described in Exceptions 1  and  2,  they  could  in  principle
             constitute 'very  compelling  circumstances,  over  and  above
             those described in Exceptions  1  and  2',  whether  taken  by
             themselves or in conjunction with other  factors  relevant  to
             application of Article 8.

         31.  An interpretation of  the  relevant  phrase  to  exclude  this
             possibility would lead to  violation  of  Article  8  in  some
             cases, which plainly was not Parliament's intention.  In terms
             of relevance and weight for a proportionality  analysis  under
             Article  8,  the  factors  singled  out  for  description   in
             Exceptions 1 and 2 will apply with  greater  or  lesser  force
             depending on the specific facts of a particular case.  To take
             a simple example in relation to  the  requirement  in  section
             117C(4)(a) for Exception 1, the offender in  question  may  be
             someone age 37 who came to the UK aged 18 and hence  satisfies
             that requirement; but his claim under Article 8 is  likely  to
             be very much weaker than the claim of an offender now aged  80
             who came to the UK aged 6 months, who by dint of  those  facts
             satisfies that requirement.  The circumstances in  the  latter
             case might well be highly relevant  to  whether  it  would  be
             disproportionate and a breach  of  Article  8  to  deport  the
             offender, having regard to the guidance given by the ECtHR  in
             Maslov v Austria [2009] INLR 47, and hence highly relevant  to
             whether there are 'very  compelling  circumstances,  over  and
             above those described in Exceptions 1 and 2.'

         32.  Similarly, in the case of a medium offender, if all  he  could
             advance in support of his Article 8 claim was  a  'near  miss'
             case in which he fell short of bringing himself within  either
             Exception 1 or Exception 2, it would not be  possible  to  say
             that  he  had  shown  that   there   were   'very   compelling
             circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions  1
             and 2'.  He would need to have a far stronger case  than  that
             by reference to the interests protected by Article 8 to  bring
             himself within that  fall  back  protection.   But  again,  in
             principle there may be cases in which such an offender can say
             that features of his case of a kind described in Exceptions  1
             and 2 have such great force for Article 8 purposes  that  they
             do constitute  such  very  compelling  circumstances,  whether
             taken by themselves  or  in  conjunction  with  other  factors
             relevant to Article 8  but  not  falling  within  the  factors
             described in Exceptions 1 and 2.  The decision  maker,  be  it
             the Secretary of State or a tribunal, must  look  at  all  the
             matters  relied  upon  collectively,  in  order  to  determine
             whether they are sufficiently compelling to outweigh the  high
             public interest in deportation.

         33.   Although  there  is  no  'exceptionality'   requirement,   it
             inexorably follows from the statutory scheme that the cases in
             which circumstances are sufficiently  compelling  to  outweigh
             the high public interest in deportation  will  be  rare.   The
             commonplace incidents of family life, such as  ageing  parents
             in poor  health  or  the  natural  love  between  parents  and
             children, will not be sufficient."

47. Having then continued by recognising that the "best interests"  of  any
    children  carried  great  weight,  the  court  identified  the  correct
    approach in the case of a "serious offender" such as the  appellant  as
    follows:

         "37.     In relation to  a  serious  offender,  it  will  often  be
             sensible first to see whether his case involves  circumstances
             of the kind described in Exceptions 1 and 2, both because  the
             circumstances so described set  out  particularly  significant
             factors bearing upon respect for private  life  (Exception  1)
             and respect for family life (Exception 2) and because that may
             provide a helpful basis on which an  assessment  can  be  made
             whether there are "very  compelling  circumstances,  over  and
             above those described in Exceptions 1 and 2"  as  is  required
             under section 117C(6).  It will then be necessary to  look  to
             see whether any of the factors falling within Exceptions 1 and
             2 are of  such  force,  whether  by  themselves  or  taken  in
             conjunction with any other relevant factors not covered by the
             circumstances described in Exceptions 1 and 2, as  to  satisfy
             the test in section 117C(6)."

48. The court went on to recognise that in  assessing  whether  there  were
    "very compelling" circumstances the factors set out in  the  Strasbourg
    Jurisprudence, in particular in Uner v Netherlands (2007)  45  EHRR  14
    and Maslov v Austria [2009] INLR 47, should be taken into account.

49. That approach mirrors that recognised  more  recently  by  the  Supreme
    Court in Ali (Iraq) v  SSHD,  especially  at  [24]-[35]  and  [48]-[50]
    (referring also to  Boultif  v  Switzerland  (2001)  EHRR  1179).   The
    Supreme Court also noted, applying earlier authority in  the  Court  of
    Appeal, that there must be "a very strong claim indeed" for  Art  8  to
    prevail (see, e.g. [14] and [15]).

50. In this appeal, the judge found at paras 12 and 14 that  the  appellant
    could not succeed under Exception 1 or Exception  2.   At  para  12  he
    accepted that Exception 1 did not apply because "the appellant has been
    lawfully resident in the UK for  not  quite  half  of  his  life".   As
    regards Exception 2, the judge dealt with this at para 14 as follows:

         "14.     Applying those principles  to  the  circumstances  of  his
             case, it is clear first of all that the Appellant is indeed  a
             'foreign criminal' (as defined  in  s.117D(2))  who  has  been
             sentenced to a term of imprisonment of more than  four  years.
             For the sake of completeness, I should mention that during the
             course of the  hearing  an  issue  arose  as  to  whether  the
             Appellant's sentence at Maidstone Crown Court  in  March  2011
             had in fact been subsequently varied and reduced  at  a  later
             hearing before the Sentencing Judge - but  ultimately  it  was
             accepted on all  sides  that  did  not  in  fact  happen.   In
             relation to s.117(c) and Paragraphs 399  &  399A,  Mr  Arkless
             submitted  that  deportation  of  the  Appellant,  effectively
             leaving behind his partner and his daughter Naomi (as well  as
             the other two young children for whom he had assumed  parental
             responsibility) was inevitably and inescapably harsh, but that
             there was nothing in the Appellant's case  that  would  render
             that outcome unduly harsh.  Not  surprisingly,  the  Appellant
             could  not  really  assist  me  on  this  issue.   With   some
             reservations, I am inclined to accept Mr  Arkless  submission.
             It seems to me that the likely destruction of the  Appellant's
             family life, perhaps for ever, and the impact on  his  partner
             and child that would flow from his  deportation  is  certainly
             very harsh.  But I think that such an  outcome  is  likely  in
             many if not most cases where a foreign criminal has  formed  a
             genuine relationship and/or started a family in the  UK  prior
             to his or her deportation; and accordingly it cannot really be
             described as unduly or exceptionally harsh."

51. The issue of whether  the  appellant's  deportation  would  be  "unduly
    harsh" on the children and his partner involved not  only  taking  into
    account the impact upon them but also balancing against that the public
    interest reflected in his serious offending (see  MM  (Uganda)  v  SSHD
    [2016] EWCA Civ 450).  In this case also, there was no evidence  before
    the judge that the impact upon his partner and the  children  would  be
    other than what would be inevitable and  necessarily  follow  from  his
    deportation.  That could not, in itself, establish that  the  appellant
    fell within Exception 2 and the judge was right so to find (see,  e.g.,
    IT(Jamaica) v SSHD [2016] EWCA Civ 932 and SSHD v AJ(Zimbabwe;  SSHD  v
    VH(Vietnam) [2016] EWCA Civ 1012).

52. Having then found that neither Exception 1 or Exception 2 applied,  the
    judge  went  on  to  consider  whether  there  were  "very   compelling
    circumstances" sufficient to outweigh public interest.  At para  15  he
    directed himself as follows:

         "15.     If that is right, then one moves on to consider  what  are
             or could be the very compelling circumstances  that  might  or
             could outweigh the very considerable public  interest  in  the
             deportation of foreign criminals who  have  committed  serious
             offences, which is deemed to be conducive to the public  good.
             This, in my judgment, is the real issue in this case."

53. Mr Richards submitted that  the  judge  had  not  expressly  for  "very
    compelling  circumstances"  which  were  "over  and  above"  those   in
    Exceptions 1  or  2.   That  vital  formulation  is  omitted  from  his
    statement in para 15 although he does expressly note  that  requirement
    in para 12 and there is no reason to doubt that he  had  that  well  in
    mind when he went on to consider the appellant's case under  the  "very
    compelling circumstances" heading.  His treatment of that issue  is  at
    paras 16-19 as follows:

         "16.     First of all, I make plain that I am by no  means  certain
             that the Appellant's criminality is necessarily at an end.   I
             bear in mind that, as Mr Arkless pointed  out,  the  Appellant
             makes frequent and regular trips to London, where the  dangers
             of his becoming involved once more in the sale  of  drugs  are
             probably greatest; albeit he cannot be legitimately criticised
             for visiting his parents who live there.  Secondly, I did  not
             find the Appellant to be a particularly convincing or reliable
             witness, and of course he  has  a  long  history  of  criminal
             behaviour.   Thirdly,  my  reservations  on  this  issue  were
             plainly shared by the author of the  OASys  Assessment  report
             (see in particular pages 15, 17 & 19), who had a  much  better
             opportunity than myself to question the  Appellant  in  depth.
             Having said all that, I  must  also  bear  in  mind  that  the
             overall outcome of that assessment was that in all  areas  the
             Appellant was deemed  to  be  a  low  risk.   In  summary,  my
             conclusion is that the possibility of the  Appellant  becoming
             involved in drugs again and re-offending cannot be ruled  out,
             particularly if he were to be unemployed  for  a  long  period
             and/or get into financial difficulties in  trying  to  support
             himself and his family.  For the avoidance of doubt,  I do not
             regard  the  Appellant's  most  recent  brush  with  the   law
             concerning driving as particularly  significant  or  relevant;
             first of  all  because  of  the  prevailing  uncertainty,  and
             secondly because of the unrelated and much less serious nature
             of the alleged criminal conduct.

         17.  Whilst the Appellant is certainly a foreign criminal, in terms
             of the legal definition,  not  being  a  British  citizen  and
             having been sentenced to a term of imprisonment  of  at  least
             twelve months, the  question  I  ask  myself  is  whether  the
             practical  reality  is  rather  that  he  is  a  'home  grown'
             criminal, to adopt  Mr  Arkless  phrase.   The  whole  of  the
             Appellant's life since his birth in Plaistow has been spent in
             the UK, and whilst it was not until  December  2002  that  his
             status  here  became  lawful,  when  his  mother  successfully
             applied for indefinite leave to remain  for  herself  and  her
             children, his earlier unlawful presence  in  the  country  can
             hardly be held against him, since he was then (2002) a 13 year
             old  child.   There  was  no  challenge  to  the   Appellant's
             evidence, supported by appropriate documentation, that he  was
             brought up and educated in  London,  attending  local  schools
             before going onto college.  Mr Arkless also accepted,  when  I
             raised the matter with him, that the Appellant could  in  fact
             have  applied  successfully  for  registration  as  a  British
             citizen at any time after December 1998, his  tenth  birthday,
             pursuant to s.1(4) British Nationality Act 1981; but didn't do
             so, no  doubt as a result of ignorance on  his  part,  coupled
             with the fact that after December 2002 he had indefinite leave
             to remain.  There was no challenge to the Appellant's evidence
             that all his subsisting family ties are in the UK, that he has
             never left the country or visited  Nigeria,  and  has  had  no
             contact with those of his mother's relations  that  remain  in
             Nigeria; or that he is involved in a  genuine  and  subsisting
             relationship with a UK citizen and has assumed  and  exercises
             parental responsibility for her three small children, only one
             of whom is his.   In  the  light  of  all  those  matters,  to
             describe the Appellant as a 'foreign' criminal  for  the  sole
             reason that his  parents  are  Nigerian  seems  to  me  to  be
             somewhat artificial.

         18.  Whilst the Appellant has worked and studied  in  a  number  of
             different fields, he  has  no  qualifications,  other  than  7
             GCSE's and there is nothing to suggest that he would  be  able
             to support himself, to find work or accommodation if  deported
             to  Nigeria.   Although  the  OASys  report  speaks   of   the
             Appellant's father periodically returning to Nigeria 'to  work
             and build a home' (page 11),  that  was  not  the  Appellant's
             evidence to the Tribunal, and the matter was not  raised  with
             him in  cross  examination.   Equally,  whilst  English  is  a
             language in use in Nigeria, there are a number of others,  and
             the Appellant's inability to speak  any  of  them  might  well
             prove to be a  significant  handicap  in  his  trying  to  get
             himself established  there,  particularly  outside  the  major
             cities.  In the light of the  Appellant's  entirely  UK  based
             history and  upbringing,  his  lack  of  ties  or  support  in
             Nigeria, of means  and  useful  qualifications/experience,  it
             appears likely that he would struggle to  survive  there,  and
             might well just sink without trace.

         19.  Do these  matters  collectively  amount  to  'very  compelling
             circumstances'?  In my judgment they do.  On  the  evidence  I
             heard, the Appellant has no real contact  or  connection  with
             Nigeria  of  any  kind,  apart  from  the  bare  fact  of  his
             parentage.  His whole history is British, and to deport him to
             Nigeria would be to take advantage of that single fact and  of
             the fortuitous accident that the Appellant did not  apply  for
             registration as a British citizen at some point after 1998.  I
             bear in mind not only the Appellant's  very  serious  criminal
             record, but also the possibility of his becoming  involved  in
             the use  and  sale  of  drugs  in  future  (albeit  the  OASys
             assessment is that he is low risk).  However even if that were
             to happen, it would not alter the fact that for all  practical
             purposes he would be essentially a British criminal, and  that
             it  is  artificial  to  treat  him  as  a  foreign   criminal.
             Deportation   would,   in   my   judgment,   completely    and
             unjustifiably undermine the Appellant's right to  respect  for
             his private and family life, in breach of Article  8(2)  ECHR,
             and the UK's obligations thereunder.  For these  reasons,  the
             Appellant's appeal against deportation must succeed."

54. There are, in my judgment, a number of difficulties  with  the  judge's
    reasoning in these paragraphs.

55. First, the judge made a number of factual findings  in  favour  of  the
    appellant despite concluding that he is not a "particularly  convincing
    or reliable  witness".   One  relevant,  and  potentially  significant,
    factor  in  assessing  first,  whether  there  were  "very  significant
    obstacles" to  the  appellant's  integration  into  Nigeria  and  then,
    whether the appellant's circumstances reached the higher standard being
    "over and above" those, was what ties the appellant and his family  had
    with Nigeria.  It was the appellant's evidence that he had no effective
    ties with Nigeria even though his mother  had  siblings  living  there.
    The appellant had told his offender manager that his father had made  a
    number of visits to Nigeria but his oral evidence was  otherwise.   The
    judge accepted his oral evidence but without explanation other than  to
    state the counter intuitive reason that  he  was  not  a  "particularly
    convincing or reliable witness".  That finding, together  with  a  bald
    acceptance of everything the appellant said about his lack of ties with
    Nigeria, runs wholly counter to the judge's earlier  finding  that  the
    appellant was not a "particularly convincing or reliable witness".

56. An appellate Tribunal should be slow  and  cautious  in  setting  aside
    factual findings made by a Tribunal who had the benefit of  seeing  and
    hearing an individual giving evidence.  Here, however, the judge's only
    substantive  observation  in  relation  to  the  appellant's   evidence
    appears, on its face, to stand in  contradistinction  to  his  positive
    findings which are otherwise unreasoned.  In my judgment, the Secretary
    of  State's  grounds  correctly  identify  a  failure  in  the  judge's
    reasoning that led him to conclude positively that the appellant had no
    ties (in a number of respects) with Nigeria.

57. Secondly, in any event, the judge failed properly to assess the  public
    interest with his repeated reference to the  appellant's  circumstances
    leading to him being treated "artificially" as  a  "foreign  criminal".
    Whilst the appellant's long residence in the UK, together with the fact
    that he had been granted ILR since 2002 was  undoubtedly  relevant,  he
    was, however, undoubtedly a "foreign criminal".

58. Thirdly, his recent offending was very serious and,  as  the  case  law
    makes absolutely plain, he would need to  have  a  "very  strong  claim
    indeed" based upon his private and family life in  order  to  establish
    "very compelling circumstances" so as to outweigh the public  interest.
    His family life did not even  engage  Exception  2  under  the  "unduly
    harsh" rubric.  It could not, therefore, properly be seen to give  rise
    to "very compelling circumstances over and  above  those  described  in
    Exceptions 1 and 2".

59. Fourthly, in respect to Exception 1, the  judge  did  not  identify  or
    conclude  that  there  were  "very  significant   obstacles"   to   the
    appellant's integration into Nigeria.  The only aspect of  Exception  1
    to which the judge referred is in para 12 was the fact  that  he  could
    not qualify as he had not been lawfully resident in the UK for "most of
    his life".  It is wholly unclear from the judge's reasoning in paras 15-
    19 whether he found that there were (a) "very significant obstacles  to
    the appellant's integration into  Nigeria"  and;  (2)  if  there  were,
    whether the degree of difficulty  was  sufficiently  "over  and  above"
    those required for Exception 1 to be of  "an  exceptionally  compelling
    kind" so as to satisfy the "very high standard" in  s.117C(6)  (see  NA
    (Pakistan) at [30] and  RJG  v  SSHD  [2016]  EWCA  Civ  1042  at  [36]
    respectively).

60. Fifthly, whilst the judge referred to  the  "very  considerable  public
    interest in the deportation of foreign criminals" at para 15, there  is
    no recognition of the need for a "very strong  claim  indeed"  and  the
    weighing of the very strong and  powerful  public  interest  given  the
    appellant's index  offence  and  his  demonstrable  serial  criminality
    involving Class A drugs.  As the judge  recognised  at  para  16,  even
    though the OASys Report put his risk  of  re-offending  as  "low",  re-
    offending could not be ruled out if he were unemployed or in  financial
    difficulties.  Although the judgment does, as I have indicated, contain
    expressions of the public interest, the whole tenor of paragraphs 16-19
    of the judgment is to obviate  or,  at  least,  understate  the  strong
    public interest engaged on the facts of  the  case.   That  is  nowhere
    clearer than in para 19 where, again, the judge stated that it would be
    "artificial to treat him as a foreign criminal".

61. Finally, although this point was not directly raised in the grounds,  I
    have  considerable  difficulty  in  seeing   the   relevance   to   the
    proportionality exercise of the fact that the appellant could have, but
    did not, apply for registration as a British citizen following his 10th
    birthday.  Of course, it was relevant that he had ILR but the relevance
    of an unmade application  for,  and  now  as  a  result  of  conviction
    unattainable, status as a British citizen is not readily apparent.

62. For these reasons, therefore, I am satisfied that the judge's  decision
    to allow the appellant's appeal under Art  8  involved  the  making  of
    material errors of law.  Those errors both infect the  judge's  factual
    findings (both primary and secondary) and his ultimate conclusion  that
    the public interest was outweighed by "very compelling circumstances".

Decision and Disposal

63. For the above reasons, the First-tier Tribunal's decision to allow  the
    appellant's appeal involved the making of  a  material  error  of  law.
    That decision cannot stand and is set aside.

64. I have considered  whether  it  would  be  appropriate  to  remake  the
    decision in the Upper Tribunal or remit the appeal  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  Having regard to para 7.2 of the Senior President's Practice
    Statement, the nature  and  extent  of  the  fact  finding  merits  the
    remittal of the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.

65. That hearing will be de novo.  None of  the  earlier  Judge's  positive
    findings in the appellant's favour can stand for  the  reasons  I  have
    given.

66. The Judge at the next  hearing  will  need  to  make  relevant  factual
    findings, not least, as to the application of Part 5A of  the  NIA  Act
    2002, including the applicability of Exceptions 1 or 2, which has to be
    applied at the date of the next hearing.  Further, as regards Exception
    1, Mr Richards indicated that with the passage of  time  the  appellant
    now satisfies the requirement in s.117C(4)(a) of having spent "most  of
    [his] life" in the UK.  There is, of course, no findings in respect  of
    the requirements in s.117C(4)(b) and (c).  As regards Exception 2,  the
    Judge's  finding  in  respect  of  s.117C(5)  -  that  the  appellant's
    deportation was not "unduly harsh"  - stands as a finding at  the  date
    of the earlier hearing, but an assessment must be made at the  date  of
    the next hearing when considering s.117C(5).

67. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be  determined  on
    the above basis by a judge other than Judge R E Barrowclough.
