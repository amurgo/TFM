Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr N Bramble, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr P Uar, Counsel instructed by N.C. Brothers & Co
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The respondent, whom I shall refer  to  as  the  appellant  as  he  was
    before the First-tier Tribunal, is a citizen of Nepal and his  date  of
    birth is  28  May  1985.   The  appellant  made  an  application  under
    paragraph 281 of the Immigration Rules to join his wife Rojina Sah Teli
    in the UK.  The application was made on 6 July 2012 and it was  refused
    by the Entry Clearance Officer in a decision dated 22 October 2012.  It
    was refused because the ECO was not satisfied that the appellant  would
    be able to meet the maintenance and accommodation requirements  of  the
    Rules.

2.   The appellant appealed against the decision of the ECO and  his  appeal
    was allowed by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Page in a determination
    which was promulgated on 23 April 2014.  The Judge heard evidence  from
    the sponsor and found that her evidence was compelling and he  recorded
    that it was not challenged throughout the  hearing  by  the  Presenting
    Officer.

3.   The Judge went on to make findings relating to  the  sponsor's  income.
    At [11] the Judge found as follows:

         "During 2012 she [the sponsor] was receiving �800 per month in rent
         from her tenants at the address in  Reading.   She  was  renting  a
         shared property in Canterbury where she was doing her NHS  training
         paying �320 per month.  She had �480 per month after that was paid.
          She also had a student bursary of �384 per month.  In addition  to
         this she had savings that are proved with her bank  statements  for
         2012.  At the time of the respondent's decision she had �3,569 in a
         Halifax savings account.  In addition to this she had in  her  Hong
         Kong branch of the HSBC Bank the  sterling  equivalent  of  �4,440.
         All of this  cash  was  accessible  by  her  at  the  time  of  the
         respondent's decision.  She also had  available  to  her  part-time
         employment in the restaurant above which was paid cash."

    On the basis of the Judge's findings he went on  to  allow  the  appeal
    under the Immigration Rules.

4.   The permission application argues that at the hearing it was agreed  by
    both representatives that  there  was  a  shortfall  of  �24  a  month.
    However, the Judge made no findings on this point and failed to resolve
    a matter of conflict.

5.   In oral submissions Mr Bramble said that he had  looked  again  at  the
    determination and the error in his view  is  not  material  (the  error
    being that the Judge did not mention  the  shortfall  that  was  agreed
    between the representatives at the hearing).  In his view even if there
    is a shortfall it would not  be  material  because  the  appellant  had
    significant savings as found by the Judge.

6.   Mr Uar argued that in his view there was no error of law.   The  income
    threshold was �111.45 for a couple and in his view it appears that  the
    representatives at the hearing before the First-tier  Tribunal  doubled
    this amount in error and this led to them concluding that  there  would
    be a shortfall.   However,  the  calculation  made  by  the  Judge  was
    correct.  Mr Uar submitted that in addition to the savings held by  the
    sponsor and identified by the Judge she had an ISA of �4,500 and �5,500
    in  a  current  account.   This  evidence  was  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

7.   Whilst it may be that case that the parties at the hearing  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal appeared to agree that there was  a  shortfall  and
    the Judge did not record this, the fact is that any agreement was on an
    erroneous basis which now appears to be accepted by  the  Secretary  of
    State. There is no challenge to the figures used by the Judge in  order
    to calculate the sponsor's income and it is  obvious  that  the  income
    would  exceed  the  income  support  level  at  that  time.   In  these
    circumstances there is no error of law and the decision of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal to allow the appeal under the Immigration Rules stands.
