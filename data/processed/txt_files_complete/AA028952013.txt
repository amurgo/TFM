For the Appellant:     Mr I Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This appeal is subject to an anonymity order  made  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal pursuant to  rule  45(4)(i)  of  the  Asylum  and  Immigration
    Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005 (SI 2005/230).  Neither  party  invited
    me to rescind the order and I continue it pursuant to rule  14  of  the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (SI 2008/2698).



Introduction

 2. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against the decision of the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge Archer) which allowed the claimant's  appeal
    against the Secretary of State's decision taken on  14  March  2013  to
    refuse to grant her asylum under para 336 of the Immigration Rules  (HC
    395 as amended) and to  remove  her  to  the  Ivory  Coast  by  way  of
    directions under s.10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.

 3. For convenience, I will refer to the parties as  they  appeared  before
    the First-tier Tribunal.

 4. The appellant is a citizen of the Ivory Coast who was born on  22  July
    1993.  She arrived in the  United  Kingdom  on  12  December  2009  and
    claimed asylum.  Her claim was refused on  21  May  2010  but  she  was
    granted discretionary leave until 22 January 2011.  On 12 January  2011
    she applied for further leave and that was refused  on  26  July  2012.
    Thereafter, the appellant made further submissions on  12  August  2012
    and 13 February 2013.  Those submissions were made on the  basis  of  a
    claimed risk to the appellant's daughter who had been born in the UK in
    2012.  The appellant claimed that her daughter was in danger  of  being
    forced into marriage and undergoing female  genital  mutilation  (FGM).
    The appellant's claim for asylum based upon the risk  to  her  daughter
    was refused by the Secretary of State on 14 March 2013.  The  appellant
    appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal.   Judge  Archer  found  that  the
    appellant's daughter would be at risk of FGM on  return  to  the  Ivory
    Coast and there would not be a  sufficiency  of  state  protection  and
    internal relocation was not open to the  Appellant  and  her  daughter.
    Consequently, he allowed the appeal on asylum grounds  and  also  under
    Art 3 of the ECHR but made no decision under Art 8 of the ECHR.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

 5. On 24 May 2013, the Secretary of State was granted permission to appeal
    to the Upper Tribunal by the First-tier Tribunal (Judge  Fisher).   The
    grant of permission was on the basis that the judge had arguably  erred
    in law in applying the Country Guidance case of MD (Women) Ivory  Coast
    CG [2010] UKUT 00215 (IAC) and, without any evidential  basis,  finding
    that the appellant's daughter was at risk  of  abduction  in  order  to
    undergo FGM.

 6. The appeal was initially listed before me on 25  October  2013.   In  a
    decision dated 13 November 2013, I  concluded  that  Judge  Archer  had
    erred in law in reaching his finding that the appellant's daughter  was
    at risk of FGM if returned to the Ivory Coast.  My reasons are set  out
    in full in that decision and it is not necessary to repeat  them  here.
    Consequently, I set aside the judge's finding  and  directed  that  the
    appeal be listed for a resumed hearing in order for the Upper  Tribunal
    to remake the decision in respect of the appellant's asylum  claim  and
    under Art 3 of the ECHR.  Thus, the appeal again came before  me  on  9
    January 2014.

 7. Ms Fenney, who represented the appellant, relied only  on  the  Refugee
    Convention and Art 3 of the ECHR on  the  basis  that  the  appellant's
    daughter was at risk of FGM on return to the Ivory Coast.

 8. At the earlier hearing, the (then) Presenting Officer  (Mr  Hibbs)  had
    indicated that the respondent would wish to argue  that  the  appellant
    could not succeed in her asylum or Art 3 claim solely on the basis of a
    risk to her daughter but not directly to herself.   At  the  outset  of
    this  hearing,  Mr  Richards,  who  now  represented  the   respondent,
    indicated that he did not rely on that point and he accepted  that  the
    appellant could succeed in her claim under the Refugee  Convention  and
    Art 3 if there was a real risk to her daughter  of  undergoing  FGM  on
    return to the Ivory Coast.

The Evidence

 9. At the hearing, the appellant briefly gave oral evidence before me.  In
    her evidence-in-chief, the appellant said that if she returned  to  the
    Ivory Coast she would have to work as that was the only way for her  to
    survive.  She said that if she went to work she did not know who  would
    look after her daughter.  There was no one she could give her  daughter
    to and nobody she could leave her with.  She  said  that  she  did  not
    trust anyone.  When she was asked why she did  not  trust  anyone,  the
    appellant said it was because she remembered that she had been left  at
    home by her mother and that, as a result, she had undergone FGM and she
    did not want that to happen to her daughter.  She said that she thought
    this would happen because of the culture.  They had to do  circumcision
    because it was what they believed in in their religion.

10. In cross-examination, the appellant confirmed that her daughter was  1ï¿½
    years old.  She was not sure when her daughter would go  to  school  in
    the Ivory Coast.  The appellant confirmed that she was 7 years old when
    she underwent FGM.  She told me that only  her  father  wanted  her  to
    undergo FGM and not her mother.  The appellant said that it was  likely
    that her father had arranged for her to undergo FGM.  The appellant was
    asked who would arrange for her daughter to undergo FGM; the  appellant
    replied, "anyone", a "family friend" or "head of the family"; it  could
    be anyone.  She was asked why, if she had to go to work, the  appellant
    could not ask someone who looked after her daughter whether they agreed
    with FGM.  The appellant said that she could ask but they might lie  to
    her.  In any event, the appellant said that even if the person did  not
    agree with FGM, she might be convinced to release her  daughter.   When
    asked who "they" were, the appellant said that it could be anyone.

11. There was no re-examination.

The Law

12. The burden of proof is upon the appellant to establish that there is  a
    real risk that her daughter will be subject to FGM  on  return  to  the
    Ivory Coast so that  the  appellant  will  establish  a  real  risk  of
    persecution for a Convention Reason (namely as a member of a particular
    social group) or serious ill-treatment contrary to Art 3 of the ECHR.

The Submissions

13. Mr Richards submitted that, taking into account  the  Country  Guidance
    case of MD, there was no general risk of FGM in Abidjan which  was  the
    city in the Ivory Coast  to  which  the  appellant  would  return.   He
    submitted that there was no real risk to the appellant's daughter where
    a parent or parents who have care of that child do not consent  to  the
    practice of FGM.  Here, he submitted that the appellant did not consent
    and, it was common ground, that the father of the appellant's child was
    not a factor.  Mr Richards submitted that the appellant had  failed  to
    identify  anybody  who  was  a  threat  to  the  child.   It  was  only
    speculation, he submitted, that someone such as a neighbour  or  friend
    or family  member  might  abduct  the  child.   He  accepted  that  the
    possibility could not be entirely ruled  out  but,  given  the  Country
    Guidance in MD, it could not be said that there was a  real  likelihood
    or real risk of FGM being carried  out  on  the  appellant's  child  in
    Abidjan.

14. On behalf of the appellant, Ms Fenney submitted that each case must  be
    decided on its own facts.  It was  accepted  that  the  appellant  had,
    herself, undergone FGM and she would be returning to the same home area
    where that had taken place.  Ms Fenney submitted that the appellant was
    not wealthy and she would be part of the "urban poor" and would have to
    work.  As a result, her daughter would need to  be  looked  after.   In
    relation to MD, Ms Fenney drew my attention to [269] that FGM was still
    a problem and to [270] and [276], that there  was  social  pressure  to
    conform to the local mores including FGM and there was an insufficiency
    of protection  offered  in  the  Ivory  Coast.   Ms  Fenney  submitted,
    although MD concluded that there was  no  evidence  of  children  being
    abducted from their parents (see [269]), this was not a case  concerned
    with abduction but rather where the appellant's  child  would  be  left
    with a neighbour or someone else in an area where FGM was the norm  and
    there was a real risk that such a person would hand the child over.

Discussion and Findings

15. I begin with the background evidence relevant to the practice of FGM in
    the Ivory Coast contained in the Country Guidance case of  MD.   I  set
    out this material in my earlier decision but it is helpful  to  set  it
    out in full again here.

16. At [269], the Upper Tribunal said this about the practice of FGM in the
    Ivory Coast:

         "269.    In some areas of the Ivory Coast, the practice of  FGM  is
             almost universal.  In contrast, it cannot  be  said  that  all
             women in the urban areas face FGM.  Once again we do  not  say
             that there will be no-one at risk in  an  urban  area  because
             this will depend on the specific dynamics of the community  in
             which an applicant finds herself.  It  is  unlikely  that  the
             pressure is  anything  like  as  great  amongst  well-educated
             sections of society or among the well-off.  Where the  parents
             of a child are against the practice, we see  no  mechanism  by
             which their wishes will not determine the issue.  No  evidence
             of physical  coercion  against  parents  in  order  to  effect
             circumcision on their daughters was produced  before  us.   In
             other words there is no evidence that the non-circumcised  are
             abducted in order to  effect  FGM  in  the  face  of  parental
             opposition."

17. It is, in effect, the final sentence of this paragraph which is  relied
    upon by Mr Richards in this appeal.

18. At [270] the Tribunal  went  on  to  consider  the  extent  of  "social
    pressure" to conform to the local mores including FGM:

         "270 The most we can say is that amongst  a  traditional  community
             there is likely to be social pressure exerted  to  conform  to
             the mores of the community and, depending on the attitude  and
             fortitude of the individuals concerned, the  pressure  may  or
             may not be capable of being withstood.  In practice, this will
             not arise in the majority of cases in a traditional  community
             because most will willingly adopt the practice as  a  rite  of
             passage for whatever reasons they may have.   Social  pressure
             to conform, however,  does  not  inevitably  lead  to  parents
             succumbing to it if they are set against the practice."

19. At [277] the Upper Tribunal  considered  the  possibility  of  internal
    relocation, in particular to Abidjan and  the  reasonableness  of,  for
    example, a single woman returning there  (whether  with  or  without  a
    child):

         "277.    If a person who has been found to be a refugee in her home
             area seeks to relocate to another part of the Ivory Coast, the
             normal destination will be Abidjan but it may also be  one  of
             several  urban  centres.   Abidjan  will  be  able  to   offer
             opportunities for a returning refugee by way of accommodation,
             work and a variety of ethnic cultures.  A single woman will be
             confronted with the difficulties attendant upon her status but
             she will not be at risk of persecution  or  serious  harm  for
             that  reason  alone.   As  a  matter  of  common  sense,   the
             difficulties will be greater for a single woman with  a  child
             but we are satisfied Abidjan is able to provide an environment
             where those without a network of male or  family  support  are
             able to lead a relatively normal  life  without  the  risk  of
             destitution or being forced, through  want,  into  beggary  of
             prostitution.    Nevertheless,   such   cases   will   require
             consideration  on  a  case-by-case  basis,  paying  particular
             attention to the support mechanisms that are likely  to  exist
             in a mixed urban area without significant evidence  of  fierce
             racial or ethnic divides."

20. At [278]-[279], the Upper Tribunal noted a  "strong  contrast"  between
    the traditional rural communities particularly in the north or  central
    regions in contrast to Abidjan which  it  described  as  a  "relatively
    cosmopolitan city of mixed ethnicity along with other urban cities".

21. At [279] the Upper Tribunal noted:

         "279.    This attitude impacts upon the risk faced by women of FGM,
             forced marriage, domestic violence, the  effects  of  adultery
             and discrimination."

22. At [280], the Upper Tribunal noted that:

         "280.    If ..., a woman faces one of those  risks,  the  state  is
             unlikely to offer a sufficiency of protection in that area, in
             which case internal relocation may be possible  without  undue
             hardship."







23. At [281], the Upper Tribunal noted that:

         "281.    We have said that there is a big variation from  place  to
             place and that a decision-maker must look at,  on  a  case  by
             case basis, the specific community from  which  the  appellant
             comes to make an assessment of risk in the home area."

24. At [282], the Upper Tribunal concluded as follows:

         "282.    We have concluded  that  women  in  the  Ivory  Coast  are
             capable of being members of a Particular Social Group and that
             the risk that they may suffer from FGM, domestic violence  and
             forced  marriage  is  sufficiently  serious   to   amount   to
             persecutory treatment in  the  absence  of  a  sufficiency  of
             protection, but the risk is not universal and in particular is
             very much less likely in an urban area such as Abidjan."

25. The appellant will be returning to Abidjan.  That is  an  urban  centre
    which, as the Upper Tribunal points out in MD, is  an  area  where  the
    social mores, including social pressure to undergo FGM is  less  strong
    than in a more "traditional community".  I accept  that  the  appellant
    will return to Abidjan and will probably  need  to  work  in  order  to
    support herself.  As a consequence, at least until her daughter attends
    school, but even thereafter out of school time, the appellant is likely
    to need to find someone to  look  after  her  daughter  whilst  she  is
    working.

26. The appellant is opposed to FGM.  In MD, the Upper Tribunal  stated  at
    [269] that:

         "No evidence of physical  coercion  against  parents  in  order  to
         effect circumcision of their daughters was produced before us.   In
         other words there is  no  evidence  that  the  non-circumcised  are
         abducted  in  order  to  effect  FGM  in  the  face   of   parental
         opposition."

27. Whilst I have no reason to  doubt  the  sincerity  of  the  appellant's
    fears, they are not, in my judgment, well-founded so as to establish  a
    real risk to her daughter.  It is pure  speculation  who  may  wish  to
    carry out FGM on the appellant's daughter.  There is no  evidence  that
    children are abducted against their parents' wishes in order to undergo
    FGM.  It is open to the appellant, as a practical matter,  to  seek  to
    leave her daughter in the care of someone whom she can trust to respect
    her views that her daughter should not undergo FGM.  In my  view,  that
    is a practical option open to the appellant.

28. The appellant was not specific as to who might wish to carry out FGM on
    her daughter.  She did not, for example, suggest that  her  own  father
    (the child's grandfather) would wish to do so.  In any event, there  is
    no evidence that this would occur against the  appellant's  wishes  and
    that her daughter would be "taken" from the care of an individual  whom
    the appellant could identify as someone she could trust to respect  her
    views opposing FGM. The appellant's own  position  was  different:  her
    father favoured FGM.

29. Taking into account all the evidence including that set out above  from
    MD, it is in my judgment no more than speculation that persons  unknown
    will "take" the appellant's daughter and subject her to FGM, in effect,
    against the wishes of  the  appellant.   Indeed,  the  very  notion  of
    "taking" the appellant's daughter against  the  appellant's  wishes  is
    contrary to the Upper Tribunal's assessment in MD of the  situation  in
    the Ivory Coast.  I do not accept that the appellant will be unable  to
    find suitable (and safe) carers for her daughter whilst she is at work.
     Consequently, I am not satisfied that there is a real  risk  that  the
    appellant's daughter will be subject to FGM  on  return  to  the  Ivory
    Coast.  For these reasons, the appellant has failed  to  establish  her
    claim under the Refugee Convention and Art 3 of the ECHR.

30. As I have already indicated, the appellant does not rely upon any other
    basis to remain in the UK.  Thus, the appellant's appeal  is  dismissed
    on all grounds.

Decision

31. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal to allow the appellant's appeal
    under the Refugee Convention and Art 3 involved the making of an  error
    of law.  That decision is set aside.

32. I remake  the  decision,  dismissing  the  appellant's  appeal  on  all
    grounds.
