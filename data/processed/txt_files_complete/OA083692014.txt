                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction and Background

 1. The Appellant appeals against the decision  of  Judge  Shergil  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal (the FtT) promulgated on 19th May 2015.

 2. The Appellant is a female citizen of Pakistan born 1st January 1989 who
    applied for entry clearance to the United Kingdom, so  that  she  could
    settle with her spouse Hasan Saleem (the  Sponsor)  who  is  a  British
    citizen.

 3. The  application  was  refused  on  18th  June  2014.   The  Respondent
    contended that  the  Appellant  had  made  false  representations  with
    regards to the Sponsor's income and therefore  the  refusal  was  based
    upon S-EC.2.2(a) which is set out below;
         '... false information,  representations  or  documents  have  been
         submitted  in  relation  to  the   application   (including   false
         information submitted to any person to obtain a  document  used  in
         support of the application);'

    The Respondent contended that the amounts deposited into the  Sponsor's
    bank account did not match the figures shown on his pay slips,  despite
    the payment method being listed as BACS.  In addition  to  the  amounts
    being different, the salary deposits shown in the bank statements  were
    not made via BACS.

 4. In addition the Respondent refused the application with reference to E-
    ECP.3.1 because the evidence did not prove  that  the  Sponsor's  gross
    income from his employment was at least ï¿½18,600 per year.

 5. The Appellant appealed and  appeared  before  the  FtT,  without  legal
    representation, on 5th May 2015.  After hearing evidence the FtT  found
    that the Sponsor was not a witness of truth, and dismissed  the  appeal
    under the Immigration Rules and on human rights grounds.

 6. The Appellant thereafter obtained legal representation, and applied for
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.

 7. In summary it was contended that the FtT had acted unfairly because the
    Respondent had provided a bundle of documents,  which  was  incomplete.
    The Respondent had failed to provide to the Tribunal full copies of the
    bank statements supplied with the Appellant's application.  The FtT had
    noticed this, but had made no attempt to obtain  the  full  statements.
    Had the FtT had the complete statements, it would have  had  a  clearer
    picture as to the Sponsor's finances, and the Sponsor could  have  been
    asked more specific questions, rather than him being  questioned  about
    documents that were not fully before the Tribunal.

 8. Had the complete documents been available, it was  submitted  that  the
    FtT may have  reached  a  different  conclusion  as  to  the  Sponsor's
    credibility,  as  he  would  have  been  able  to  refer  to  the  bank
    statements, which may have assisted him in  answering  questions  about
    deposits into his account.

 9. It was also contended that the FtT had  made  findings  without  giving
    adequate reasons.  In  particular,  an  accountant's  letter  had  been
    rejected, as had the Sponsor's evidence regarding the method of payment
    of his salary, and evidence from HMRC had also  been  rejected  without
    adequate reasons being given.

10. Permission to appeal was refused by Judge  Holmes  of  the  FtT,  which
    caused the Appellant  to  make  a  renewed  application  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, and permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal  Judge
    Taylor in the following terms;
         "Many of the points made in the grounds amount to a re-argument  of
         the Appellant's case.  However, I am concerned about the procedural
         fairness issue.  The Appellant was not legally represented and  the
         judge was aware that the  ECO  had  provided  incomplete  evidence.
         That may or may not turn out to be material.
         All grounds may be argued".

11. Following the grant of permission  the  Respondent  lodged  a  response
    pursuant to rule 24 of The Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008  contending,  in  summary,  that  the  FtT  had  directed   itself
    appropriately.  It was not the function of the  ECO  to  make  out  the
    Appellant's case, and the burden fell on the Appellant  to  demonstrate
    that she met the requirements of the Immigration Rules.  There appeared
    to be no indication as to how any missing evidence would  have  made  a
    material difference to the appeal.

12. The Tribunal issued directions making  provision  for  there  to  be  a
    hearing before the Upper Tribunal to decide whether  the  FtT  decision
    should be set aside.

The Appellant's Submissions

13. At the hearing before me Miss Rutherford relied and expanded  upon  the
    grounds contained within the application for permission to appeal.

14. I was asked to  note  that  the  Sponsor  had  appeared  without  legal
    representation, and that the  bank  statements  were  incomplete.   The
    Sponsor had been cross-examined as  to  deposits  made  into  his  bank
    account,  and  this  was  unfair,  because  the  bank  statements  were
    incomplete.  Therefore the Sponsor was  disadvantaged,  and  there  was
    procedural unfairness.

15. I was asked  to  note  that  HMRC  documentation  had  been  submitted,
    together with P60 forms, and Miss Rutherford  submitted  that  the  FtT
    should have considered the evidence in the round rather than  rejecting
    the Sponsor's evidence, and then going on to reject the HMRC  evidence.



The Respondent's Submissions

16. Mrs Petersen confirmed that she was in possession of  the  Respondent's
    bundle that was before the FtT and the bank statements covered a period
    between 1st June 2013 and 19th December 2013 although there appeared to
    be some pages missing.   These  documents  had  been  supplied  to  the
    Respondent by the Sponsor.  It was not the case that the Respondent had
    not submitted all of the documents provided by the Sponsor.   The  bank
    statements that were before the FtT were therefore  those  supplied  by
    the Sponsor.

17. I was asked to find that the absence of some  pages  made  no  material
    difference to the decision made by the FtT.  The FtT had  analysed  the
    evidence in  its  entirety  and  was  entitled  to  conclude  that  the
    Sponsor's evidence could not be relied upon.  The issues in the  appeal
    had been made clear by the Respondent's reasons for refusal, and it was
    apparent from the Sponsor's witness statement  dated  27th  April  2015
    that he was aware of those issues.

The Appellant's Response

18. Miss Rutherford reiterated that because incomplete bank statements  had
    been submitted, the Sponsor was disadvantaged, and  this  affected  his
    ability to answer questions.

19. At the conclusion of oral submissions I reserved my decision.

My Conclusions and Reasons

20. I do not find that the FtT acted unfairly and I find no  error  of  law
    disclosed by this ground of appeal for the following reasons.

21. It is not the case that the Respondent was responsible for  failing  to
    provide full copies of the Sponsor's bank statements  to  the  FtT.   I
    accept  that  the  Respondent's  bundle  contained  all  of  the   bank
    statements that were submitted by the Sponsor to the Respondent.

22. In my  view,  when  one  party  to  the  appeal  does  not  have  legal
    representation, the FtT should be  extremely  careful  to  ensure  that
    there is a fair hearing,  and  that  the  unrepresented  party  is  not
    disadvantaged.  Having considered the FtT decision in this case,  I  am
    satisfied  that  the  Appellant  was  not  disadvantaged.   It  is  the
    responsibility of the Appellant, to provide evidence to  discharge  the
    burden of proof, and prove that the appeal should  be  allowed.   I  am
    satisfied that the issues  in  this  appeal  were  made  clear  by  the
    Respondent's reasons for refusal, and the Sponsor's  witness  statement
    indicates that he was aware of the issues in the appeal.

23. The FtT  studied  the  Sponsor's  bank  statements  and  realised  (see
    paragraph 16) some pages were missing.  The FtT specifically considered
    this point, and concluded that there was  sufficient  information  from
    the bank statements to enable the FtT to undertake "a fair and accurate
    analysis of  the  relevant  information".   Although  there  were  some
    missing pages, each bank statement showed the start balance, money  in,
    money out, and the end balance.

24. It was not the fact that there were some pages of the  bank  statements
    missing that caused the FtT to make adverse credibility findings.   The
    FtT noted the Sponsor could not explain  why  he  was  depositing  more
    money than his pay slips displayed.  The FtT observed a discrepancy  in
    the Sponsor's evidence (page 20 of the decision) as to how he was  paid
    his salary.  The Sponsor had stated in his witness  statement  that  he
    was  paid  cash  by  both  employers,  and  repeated  this  in   cross-
    examination.  However when questioned by the FtT, he contradicted  this
    evidence, stating that he was paid in cash  by  one  employer,  and  by
    cheque from another.

25. At paragraph 22 the FtT records a further discrepancy as to  the  hours
    that he worked, and noted that he was unable to state how much  he  was
    paid per hour.

26. The FtT considered  the  Sponsor's  oral  evidence  together  with  the
    documentary evidence, and was entitled to conclude that he  was  not  a
    witness of truth.

27. The FtT considered documentation supplied  by  HMRC,  and  in  my  view
    considered that evidence in the round, together with the other evidence
    submitted on behalf of the Appellant, and was entitled to conclude that
    the amount disclosed to HMRC was not  actually  what  the  Sponsor  was
    paid.

28. I therefore do not find that the FtT hearing  was  conducted  unfairly.
    The remaining grounds of appeal display a strong disagreement with  the
    conclusions reached by the FtT but do not disclose any  material  error
    of law.  The FtT has considered all the evidence supplied on behalf  of
    the Appellant, and made findings on that evidence, and  those  findings
    are supported by adequate reasons.  Paragraph 25 of  the  FtT  decision
    summarises the reasons given by the FtT.  This is not an  appeal  where
    the reasoning is so inadequate that the losing party,  looking  at  the
    decision, would not understand why they have lost.

29. In my view, the FtT did not neglect to consider any material  evidence,
    and did not place weight upon any immaterial evidence.  The  weight  to
    be attached to evidence is for the judge hearing the appeal to  decide,
    and those findings should not be set aside, unless there is a  material
    error of law, and in this appeal, whilst there is disagreement with the
    FtT findings, there is no error  of  law  and  therefore  the  decision
    stands.

Notice of Decision

The making of the decision of the FtT did  not  involve  the  making  of  an
error on a point of law such that the  decision  must  be  set  aside.   The
appeal is dismissed.

Anonymity

No anonymity direction was made by the FtT.  There has been no  request  for
anonymity made to the Upper Tribunal and no anonymity order is made.
