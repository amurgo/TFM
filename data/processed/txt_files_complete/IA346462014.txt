For the respondent:    Mr T Wilding, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appellant's  appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal  Judge  Rimmington   promulgated   30.9.15,   dismissing   the
    appellant's appeal against the decision  of  the  Secretary  of  State,
    dated 31.8.14, to refuse his application made  on  2.7.14  for  an  EEA
    Residence Card as confirmation of a right to reside in the  UK  as  the
    extended family member of an EU national exercising  Treaty  rights  in
    the UK, pursuant to the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006. By the date
    of the appeal hearing in the  First-tier  Tribunal,  the  parties  were
    married.

 2. The Judge heard the appeal on 6.8.15.

 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Landes  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    3.5.16.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 3.6.16 as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. For the reasons briefly set out below, I found such error of law in the
    making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  as  to  require  the
    decision of Judge Rimmington to be set aside and the decision remade in
    the First-tier Tribunal.

 6. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Landes found it  arguable  that
    the judge failed to correctly direct herself as to the burden of proof.



 7. At �9 and �10 the judge addressed the burden and standard of  proof  in
    cases where is asserted by the Secretary of State that the marriage  or
    relationship is one of convenience, so  as  to  be  excluded  from  the
    entitlement for a  residence  card.  Reference  was  properly  made  to
    Papajorgji (EEA spouse - marriage of convenience)  Greece  [2012]  UKUT
    00038 (IAC). The judge stated, "In respect of the claim of  a  marriage
    of convenience  the  onus  is  initially  on  the  respondent  to  show
    reasonable grounds for suspicion and once  this  has  been  proved  the
    burden shifts to the respondent."

 8. However, this was a misstatement of Papjorgji and an oversimplification
    of the law, which ignored the distinction between  the  evidential  and
    legal burden. There is no burden at the outset of such  an  application
    for an  applicant  to  demonstrate  that  a  marriage  is  not  one  of
    convenience. As the recent decision of the  Court  of  Appeal  in  Rosa
    [2016] EWCA  Civ  14  confirms,  the  evidential  burden  lies  on  the
    Secretary of State to adduce sufficient evidence to justify  reasonable
    suspicion that the  marriage  is  one  of  convenience.  Only  if  that
    evidential burden is discharged does the burden shift to the  applicant
    to address  that  evidence.  However,  the  burden  so  shifted  is  an
    evidential one; the legal burden remains  on  the  Secretary  of  State
    throughout to demonstrate on the  balance  of  probabilities  that  the
    marriage is one of convenience. It is not clear whether the  judge  has
    understood this correctly.

 9. The error of the First-tier Tribunal Judge is repeated  and  compounded
    at �34 of the decision where, after addressing the evidence, the  judge
    concludes (spelling corrected): "Nonetheless the  burden  of  proof  to
    show that there were reasonable  suspicious  circumstances  surrounding
    this relationship was discharged by the  respondent  and  the  shifting
    burden to show this a genuine durable relationship/marriage  ultimately
    rests with the appellant. This was not discharged." The burden does not
    in fact ultimately rest  with  the  appellant,  but  remains  with  the
    Secretary of State.

10. It may  be  that,  given  the  background  information,  including  the
    suggestion that the EEA family member previously sponsored a  different
    person, factual findings of the First-tier Tribunal, the outcome of the
    appeal would have been the same, but given the error of law in relation
    to the burden and standard of proof, it is unclear  whether  the  judge
    applied the correct burden standard of proof  to  those  findings;  the
    error may have fundamentally  affected  the  judge's  approach  to  the
    evidence.

11. In relation to the judge's decision at �34 to treat the fact  that  the
    appellant is learning Polish as neutral, I do not read the issue in the
    same way as urged upon me by Ms Allen. As I  read  it,  the  judge  was
    saying that she not take that they spoke different languages (Urdu  and
    Polish) as a point against the appellant and in favour of the  marriage
    being one of convenience, but rather,  to  the  appellant's  advantage,
    treated it as neutral, because there was evidence that he was  learning
    Polish.  I find no error of law in this regard.

12. As Judge Landes commented, I find that  the  other  grounds  have  less
    merit and are more in the nature of a disagreement with the findings of
    the judge.

13. However, as stated above, the error in relation to the statement of the
    burden and standard of proof is so fundamental that it  puts  in  doubt
    whether the judge has  approached  the  evidence  correctly.  There  is
    significant room for doubt, which in fairness to the appellant requires
    the decision to be made afresh.

14. When a decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside,  section
    12(2) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 requires either
    that the case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  with  directions,
    or it must be remade by the Upper Tribunal. The scheme of the Tribunals
    Court and Enforcement Act 2007 does not assign the function of  primary
    fact finding to the Upper Tribunal. Where the facts are  unclear  on  a
    crucial issue at the heart of an appeal, as  they  are  in  this  case,
    effectively there has not been a valid determination of  those  issues.
    The errors of the First-tier Tribunal Judge vitiates all other findings
    of fact and the conclusions from those facts so that there has not been
    a valid determination of the issues in the appeal.

15. In all the circumstances, I relist this appeal for a fresh  hearing  in
    the First-tier Tribunal on the basis that this is a  case  which  falls
    squarely within the Senior President's Practice Statement at  paragraph
    7.2. The effect of the error has been to deprive  the  appellant  of  a
    fair hearing and that the nature or extent of any judicial fact finding
    which is necessary for the decision in the appeal to be re-made is such
    that, having regard to the overriding objective in rule 2 to deal  with
    cases fairly and justly, including with the avoidance of delay, I  find
    that it is appropriate to remit this appeal to the First-tier  Tribunal
    to determine the appeal afresh.

Conclusions:

16. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

                    I remit the remaking of the decision in  the  appeal  to
                    the First-tier Tribunal in accordance with the  attached
                    directions.

Consequential Directions

17. The decision in the appeal is remitted to the  First-tier  Tribunal  at
    Taylor House to be heard afresh, with no findings of fact preserved;

18. The estimate length of hearing is 2 hours;

19. The appeal may be heard by any  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge,  with  the
    exception of Judge Rimmington and Judge Landes;

20. Interpreters in both Urdu and Polish will be required;

21. Not later than 10 working days before the listing of the appeal in  the
    First-tier Tribunal the appellant's representative must serve a single,
    indexed and paginated bundle of all objective and  subjective  material
    to be relied on, including copies of any relevant case law and skeleton
    argument. The Tribunal will not accept documentary evidence produced on
    the day of hearing



Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.




Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The outcome of the appeal remains to be decided.
