                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    For the sake of continuity, we will refer to the parties as they  were
      before the First-tier Tribunal although technically the  Secretary  of
      State is the appellant in the appeal before the Upper Tribunal.

2.    The appellant appealed the Secretary  of  State's  decision  dated  04
      March 2013 to refuse leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)
      Migrant. The respondent refused  the  application  under  the  general
      ground for refusal contained in paragraph 322(1A) of  the  immigration
      rules because it was asserted that a false document was  submitted  in
      relation to the application. The respondent  stated  that  Educational
      Testing Service (ETS) informed him that there was significant evidence
      to conclude that the English  language  certificate  was  fraudulently
      obtained by the use of a proxy test taker. ETS declared the test to be
      'invalid' and the score was cancelled.

3.    The second reason for refusal related to the evidence  of  funds  made
      available  by  a  third-party  contributor.  The  respondent  was  not
      satisfied that the appellant  had  access  to  the  ï¿½200,000  required
      because  the  letters  from  the  Rupali  Bank  Ltd,  the  third-party
      contributor and the solicitor were all dated 10 October 2012 i.e. over
      six weeks after the date of the application on  30  August  2012.  For
      this reason, the respondent was unable to accept the evidence relating
      to third party funding.

4.    First-tier Tribunal Judge Malcolm allowed the  appeal  in  a  decision
      promulgated on 10 April 2017. She considered the evidence put  forward
      by the respondent in support of the allegation of deception and  heard
      evidence from the appellant in response to the allegation. It  appears
      the submissions made by both parties focussed solely  on  this  issue.
      The appellant's representative submitted  that  if  his  evidence  was
      accepted, the matter would need to be referred back to  the  Secretary
      of State to consider whether it was appropriate to exercise discretion
      with reference to the 'evidential flexibility' policy  (now  contained
      in paragraph 245AA of the immigration rules). It is unclear  from  the
      decision whether this was an agreed position.

5.    The judge found that the respondent had not discharged the  burden  of
      proof to show that the appellant produced a false document in  support
      of the application. The appeal was allowed "to the limited extent that
      it is accepted that the appellant did not use deception  in  obtaining
      the English language test certificate".  The judge stated:

           "It is clear from the decision that the respondent  having  made
           the decision that deception had been used no further enquiry was
           made of the appellant for additional documentation in support of
           his  application  (as  detailed  in  the  reasons  for   refusal
           letter)." [67]

6.    On the face of it,  it  seems  unlikely  that  the  rule  relating  to
      evidential flexibility would apply to a series of documents,  claiming
      to be from different sources, which all made the  same  unusual  error
      regarding the date. If the respondent did not agree with the  approach
      taken by the First-tier Tribunal, it has not been raised as  a  ground
      of appeal before the Upper Tribunal. The respondent has only  appealed
      on the narrow point relating to the ETS/deception issue. The Secretary
      of State appeals the decision on the following grounds:

      (i)   The judge failed to give adequate reasons  to  explain  why  the
           respondent did not meet the legal burden of proof  in  light  of
           the evidence produced by the respondent and  the  relevant  case
           law.

      (ii)  The judge failed to give adequate reasons to explain her finding
           that the appellant  would  have  no  reason  to  secure  a  test
           certificate by deception when he spoke English: MA (ETS -  TOEIC
           testing) [2016] UKUT 450 referred.

      (iii)  A  general  submission  that  the  evidence  met  the  required
           evidential burden of proof and that it fell to the appellant  to
           provide an innocent explanation in response.

7.     There  was  no  appearance  by  or  on  behalf  of   the   appellant.
      Correspondence on file showed  that  the  appellant's  previous  legal
      representative was no longer instructed.  We  were  satisfied  that  a
      hearing notice was sent to the appellant's last known address and that
      he provided no explanation for his absence. In the  circumstances,  we
      were satisfied that we could proceed to determine the  appeal  in  the
      appellant's absence.

Decision and reasons

8.    After having considered the grounds  of  appeal  and  the  submissions
      made by Ms Fijiwala, we are satisfied  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
      decision did not involve the making of an error of law.

9.    We accept that some criticism could be made of the  judge's  findings,
      which were not structured in a way that made clear findings on each of
      the legal steps normally required to assess whether the respondent has
      discharged the legal burden of proof. However, we are  satisfied  that
      any shortcomings in the reasoning were not sufficiently serious to  be
      characterised as an error of law which would justify setting aside the
      decision.

10.   The judge set out the evidence contained in  the  respondent's  bundle
      in some detail earlier in the decision  [12].  In  her  findings,  she
      stated that she had considered "all of the documents lodged  and  have
      also given consideration to the case law of  Qadir"  [58].  The  Upper
      Tribunal in SM &  Qadir  (ETS  -  Evidence  -  BOP)  [2016]  UKUT  229
      concluded that, despite weaknesses in the evidence, the combination of
      the 'generic' evidence of Peter Millington and Rebecca Collings and  a
      'Look-up Tool' print out were sufficient to discharge the respondent's
      initial evidential burden of proof [68]. The Court of  Appeal  reached
      the same conclusion in SSHD v Shehzad & Chowdhury [2016] EWCA Civ  615
      [26].  The  same  evidence  was  available  in  this  case.   In   the
      circumstances, it was not necessary for the judge to explain in detail
      how and why the evidence discharged the evidential burden of proof.

11.   To the extent that the evidential burden of proof then shifts  to  the
      appellant to provide an 'innocent  explanation'  in  response  to  the
      allegation, the judge's description of  the  legal  position  "at  its
      simplest level" was broadly correct.  If  she  was  satisfied,  having
      heard evidence from the appellant, and  having  considered  the  other
      evidence, that it was likely that he genuinely took the test, then the
      respondent was unlikely to be able  to  discharge  the  overall  legal
      burden of proof.

12.   The judge found that the appellant had given detailed evidence in  his
      statement and at the hearing. He explained how he booked the test.  He
      gave a detailed description of his attendance at the test  centre  and
      the tests he undertook [57]. Having heard evidence from the  appellant
      she was satisfied that his account was credible [64].  The  fact  that
      the appellant could speak English did not form a central part  of  her
      finding, although she acknowledged the respondent's submission that it
      was likely to have improved since he had been in the UK [65].

13.   Although the reasoning could  have  been  more  structured,  it  seems
      clear that the judge considered all the  documentary  evidence  relied
      upon by the respondent, but after having heard from the appellant, she
      was satisfied that he was a credible witness. Having accepted that  it
      was likely that the appellant genuinely took the test, it was open  to
      the judge to conclude that  the  respondent  had  not  discharged  the
      overall legal burden of proof to justify refusing the application with
      reference to paragraph 322(1A) of the immigration rules.

14.   As we noted earlier, there is no challenge to the  way  in  which  the
      judge then allowed the appeal "to a limited extent". The effect of her
      decision is that the application is  outstanding  and  is  awaiting  a
      fresh decision from the respondent.

15.   We conclude that the First-tier Tribunal decision did not involve  the
      making of an error on a point of law. The decision shall stand.
