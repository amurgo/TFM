For the appellant:     Mr T Wilding, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of the Entry Clearance Officer against the  decision
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Lawrence promulgated 10.11.15, allowing on
    human rights grounds the claimant's appeal against the decision of  the
    Entry Clearance Officer, dated 6.3.15 to refuse her application made on
    13.2.15 for entry clearance to the United  Kingdom  to  settle  as  the
    spouse of Honglong Chen, a  person  present  and  settled  in  the  UK,
    pursuant to Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.  The Judge heard  the
    appeal on 2.11.15.

 2. First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Astle  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    29.4.16.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 3.6.16 as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. For the reasons briefly set out below, I found such error of law in the
    making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  as  to  require  the
    decision of Judge Lawrence to be set aside and remade in the First-tier
    Tribunal.

 5. The relevant background can be  summarised  as  follows.  The  claimant
    first came to the UK in 2000. On arrival she  sought  leave  to  remain
    indefinitely. When the application was refused the  claimant  absconded
    and remained undetected, working illegally in the UK, until her  arrest
    as an illegal entrant in 2007. She was then removed to China at  public
    expense. Subsequently, she married Mr Chen in China on 3.9.12.

 6. Following marriage, the  claimant  applied  in  March  2013  for  entry
    clearance as a partner, pursuant to Appendix FM.  The  application  was
    refused on 28.5.13. The primary  ground  of  refusal  was  pursuant  to
    paragraph 320(11) of  the  Immigration  Rules,  based  on  her  conduct
    between 2000 and her removal to  China  at  public  expense.  Paragraph
    320(11) provides that entry clearance should normally be refused  where
    an applicant has previously contrived in a significant way to frustrate
    the intention of the Rules by  overstaying  or  breaching  a  condition
    attached to leave, or being an illegal entrant, or using  deception  in
    an application and there are other aggravating  circumstances  such  as
    absconding.

 7.  The  application  was  additionally  refused  under  the   suitability
    requirements of Appendix FM, for the same conduct reasons, which  is  a
    mandatory ground of refusal. In any event, the Entry Clearance  Officer
    was not satisfied that the claimant met the financial  requirements  of
    Appendix FM, nor was the Entry Clearance Officer satisfied  that  there
    would be adequate accommodation for the claimant,  a  point  which  was
    later conceded to the claimant's advantage.

 8. The claimant's appeal against that decision  was  heard  by  First-tier
    Tribunal  Judge  Griffiths  on  1.7.14.  In  the  decision  promulgated
    15.7.14, Judge Griffiths noted the claimant's poor immigration  history
    and that neither she nor the sponsor expressed any  regret  or  offered
    any explanation for her failure to return to China when her application
    was refused. Judge Griffiths found that  the  claimant's  conduct  fell
    squarely within paragraph 320(11) as she "overstayed, took advantage of
    the benefits available to her whilst in the UK, absconded and  did  not
    voluntarily  take  any  action  to  regularise  her  position."   Judge
    Griffiths found no exceptional or  compelling  reasons  why  discretion
    should have been exercised in her  favour,  even  though  7  years  had
    elapsed; her exclusion was conducive to the public good. The judge also
    noted the precarious nature  of  the  marriage,  in  the  face  of  the
    claimant's poor immigration record with no  legitimate  expectation  of
    being able to settle in the UK.

 9. The claimant then made a further application for entry clearance  as  a
    partner, approximately 7 months after the decision of Judge  Griffiths,
    on 13.2.15. This was refused for the same reasons as the 2013  refusal,
    with reliance on paragraph 320(11) and the suitability requirements  of
    Appendix FM.

10. Judge Lawrence considered that the claimant's past immigration  conduct
    fell at the lower end  of  the  scale  and  that  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer's reliance for the purposes  of  the  Appendix  FM  suitability
    requirements on her absconding and being removed at public expense  was
    "disproportionate and too draconian."

11. In relation to reliance on paragraph 320(11), Judge Lawrence found that
    the refusal was not justified on the  facts  relied  on  by  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer. The judge also purported to find  that  in  applying
    two different provisions of the Rules, paragraph 320(11)  and  Appendix
    FM's suitability requirements, the Entry Clearance Officer was  "taking
    two bites at the same cherry,"  and  that  the  "ordinary  man  on  the
    Clapham omnibus would  find  it  unfair,  and  that  to  rely  on  both
    provisions was "disproportionate and too draconian," and in  fact  that
    refusal under the discretionary  grounds  of  320(11)  was  "even  more
    disproportionate and exceedingly draconian."  Thus  at  �12  the  judge
    concluded that on the facts of the case the refusal of entry  clearance
    was "rather disproportionate and too draconian." The judge then  added,
    "It is wrong in law."

12. The judge's  suggestion  that  it  was  unfair,  disproportionate,  and
    draconian to refuse the application on two  different  aspects  of  the
    Immigration Rules, is entirely misguided. The Entry  Clearance  Officer
    was entitled to rely on the Immigration Rules as  they  have  been  set
    out.

13. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Astle also  found  it  arguable
    that the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  misdirected  himself  in  law  and
    failed to apply binding case law. Judge  Astle  pointed  out  that  the
    claimant's previous appeal had been dismissed  following  consideration
    of  paragraph  320(11)  of  the  Immigration  Rules  and,  pursuant  to
    Devaseelan this should have been the starting point for Judge  Lawrence
    in dealing with a  second  appeal  against  a  decision  on  a  further
    application made on the same basis with almost identical facts.

14. Further, Judge Astle found it arguable that Judge  Lawrence  failed  to
    give reasons,  or  any  adequate  reasons,  for  findings  on  material
    matters, particularly in relation to  paragraph  320(11).  The  judge's
    conclusion that the claimant's behaviour fell at the lower end  of  the
    scale was not adequately  reasoned.  Hence  permission  to  appeal  was
    granted.

15. Whilst at �2 of the decision the First-tier Tribunal Judge acknowledged
    that the claimant's appeal  against  the  refusal  on  28.5.13  of  her
    previous application for entry clearance as a spouse was dismissed, the
    judge failed to take any further account of the decision of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Griffiths, promulgated 15.7.14, only some 7 months prior
    to the application which is the subject of this appeal. Judge  Lawrence
    gave no reasons for departing from the findings of Judge  Griffiths  on
    what are essentially the same facts, but for  the  marginal  additional
    elapse of time since her removal from the UK at public  expense.  Judge
    Lawrence should have taken the recent decision of  Judge  Griffiths  as
    the starting point in this second appeal  and  should  have  considered
    carefully whether there was any change of circumstances or  justifiable
    reasons for departing  from  the  findings  and  conclusions  of  Judge
    Griffiths. That  was  not  done.  Judge  Lawrence  identified  no  such
    circumstances justifying reaching an entirely different  conclusion  on
    the same facts. This amounts to a material error of law  infecting  the
    decision as a whole so that it cannot stand.

16. I further find that Judge Lawrence failed to give any or  any  adequate
    reasons for reaching  the  conclusions  made  within  the  decision  in
    respect of both paragraph 320(11) and the suitability  requirements  of
    Appendix FM, namely S-EC 1.5. The judge's statement that the claimant's
    conduct fell at the lower end  of  the  scale  and  that  "the  blanket
    application of  'conduct,'  absconding  and  being  removed  at  public
    expense, is disproportionate and too draconian," is entirely inadequate
    and unreasoned, amounting to no more than a personal view, rather  than
    a reasoned assessment.  Considering  the  significant  conduct  of  the
    claimant, I fail to see any adequate  reasoning  for  considering  that
    neither provision should apply. The judge's decision in this regard  is
    no more than a dispensation of his own discretion in place for that  of
    the Entry Clearance Officer to waive the requirements of  320(11),  and
    entirely without reasoned foundation in respect of the mandatory ground
    under S-EC 1.5. I accept that the discretion under S-EC 1.5  to  decide
    that the claimant's stated conduct makes it  is  undesirable  to  grant
    entry clearance is amenable to review by the Tribunal, but only  if  it
    has been exercised  unreasonably.  The  discussion  of  the  claimant's
    conduct in �8 and �9 of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  does
    not disclose objectively justifiable  reasons  for  setting  aside  the
    provisions of the Rules, even though the judge claims to have  balanced
    the grounds relied on against the  claimant's  rights,  the  conclusion
    that the decision of the Entry Clearance Officer was not justified  and
    disproportionate is not in fact reasoned. This amounts to an  error  of
    law.

17. When a decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside,  section
    12(2) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 requires either
    that the case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  with  directions,
    or it must be remade by the Upper Tribunal. The scheme of the Tribunals
    Court and Enforcement Act 2007 does not assign the function of  primary
    fact finding to the Upper Tribunal. Where the facts are  unclear  on  a
    crucial issue at the heart of an appeal, as  they  are  in  this  case,
    effectively there has not been a valid determination of  those  issues.
    The errors of the First-tier Tribunal Judge vitiates all other findings
    of fact and the conclusions from those facts so that there has not been
    a valid determination of the issues in the appeal.

18. In all the circumstances, I relist this appeal for a fresh  hearing  in
    the First-tier Tribunal on the basis that this is a  case  which  falls
    squarely within the Senior President's Practice Statement at  paragraph
    7.2. The effect of the error has been to deprive  the  appellant  of  a
    fair hearing and that the nature or extent of any judicial fact finding
    which is necessary for the decision in the appeal to be re-made is such
    that, having regard to the overriding objective in rule 2 to deal  with
    cases fairly and justly, including with the avoidance of delay, I  find
    that it is appropriate to remit this appeal to the First-tier  Tribunal
    to determine the appeal afresh.



Conclusions:

19. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

                    I remit the making of the decision in the appeal to  the
                    First-tier Tribunal to be made afresh in accordance with
                    the attached directions.

Consequential Directions

20. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier  Tribunal  sitting  at  Hatton
    Cross, to be heard afresh with no findings preserved;

21. The appeal may be heard by any  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge,  with  the
    exception of Judge Lawrence, Judge Griffiths, and Judge Astle;

22. The estimated length of hearing is 2 hours;

23. An interpreter in Mandarin is required;

24. Not later than 10 working days before the listed date  for  the  appeal
    hearing, the claimant or her representative must serve on the Secretary
    of State and lodge with the Tribunal a single, revised,  paginated  and
    indexed bundle containing all subjective and objective materials to  be
    relied on at the hearing, together with  copies  of  any  case  law  or
    skeleton  argument  to  be  advanced.  The  Tribunal  will  not  accept
    documentary materials produced on the day of the hearing.



Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.




Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The decision of the First-tier Tribunal has  been  set  aside.  The
outcome of the appeal remains to be decided.
