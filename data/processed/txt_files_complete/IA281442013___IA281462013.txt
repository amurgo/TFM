                                                                 Respondents

Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr C Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms J Norman, Counsel


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1.   The respondents to this appeal, Mr Okoria and his wife, Mrs Yekovie,
      are Nigerian citizens born  on  5  January  1970  and  8  August  1974
      respectively. The  appellant  is  the  Secretary  of  State,  who  has
      appealed with the permission of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  against  a
      decision  of  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Bart-Stewart,  who
      dismissed the appeals brought on the grounds that the respondents  met
      the requirements of the Immigration Rules  but  allowed  them  on  the
      basis  the  decisions  of  the  Secretary  of  State  to  remove   the
      respondents  under  section  47  of  the   Immigration,   asylum   and
      Nationality Act 2006 were not lawful.


   2.   It is more convenient to refer to the parties as  they  were  before
      the First-tier Tribunal. I shall therefore refer to Mr Okoria and  Mrs
      Yekovie from now on as "the appellants" and the Secretary of State  as
      "the respondent".


   3.   The appellants both sought leave to remain on the  basis  the  first
      appellant met the requirements of the rules for Tier 1  (Entrepreneur)
      Migrants  under  the  Points-Based  System.  He  had  established   an
      international money exchange business. The respondent was satisfied he
      had shown ï¿½50,000 available to invest in the business but he  had  not
      provided mandatory  documents  showing  he  was  engaged  in  business
      activity. The second appellant was refused as his dependant.


   4.    The appellants appealed, arguing the respondent had failed to carry
      out a thorough assessment  of  the  documents  provided.  Providing  a
      contract was not a mandatory  requirement.  The  respondent  had  also
      failed to exercise evidential flexibility. The other grounds of appeal
      were generic. Judge Bart-Stewart found the  documents  submitted  with
      the application did not entitle the appellants to  the  points  sought
      for Attributes and also held that the  decisions  were  in  accordance
      with the law. As noted, she allowed the appeals because she found  the
      removal decisions unlawful, apparently on the ground  that  they  were
      made within the same decision notices as the refusals to vary leave.


   5.    The grounds seeking permission to appeal pointed out  that  section
      51 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013 came into force on 8 May  2013  so
      decisions  made  on  25  June  2013  could  lawfully  include  removal
      decisions. Permission to appeal was granted on this basis.

   6.   The appellants have not filed a Rule 24 response opposing the appeal
      and they have not applied for permission to appeal against the judge's
      findings in respect of the rules and evidential flexibility.


   7.   I heard submissions on the question of  whether  the  judge  made  a
      material error of law requiring her decision  to  be  set  aside.   In
      fact, both representatives agreed that the appropriate course  was  to
      set aside the judge's decision that the removal decision  was  not  in
      accordance with the law and  to  substitute  a  decision  finding  the
      decision was in accordance with the law. Ms Norman confirmed there was
      no cross-appeal with respect to the judge's dismissal of  the  appeals
      under the substantive rules.


  DECISION

     The Judge of the First-tier Tribunal made a material error on a  point
    of law  and  her  decision  allowing  the  appeals  on  the  basis  the
    respondent's decisions were not in  accordance  with  the  law  is  set
    aside.


    The following decision is substituted:


    The appeals brought under the Immigration Rules are dismissed.
    The decisions were in accordance with the law.


    No anonymity direction has been made.
