For the Respondent:          Mr Worrall, Counsel instructed by Deane &
Bolton


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Respondent is a female national of Libya born on 17th October 1987.
    On the 21st July 2015 the First-tier Tribunal (Judge  Birrell)  allowed
    her appeal against a decision to refuse to grant her  leave  to  remain
    and to remove her from the  United  Kingdom  pursuant  to  s47  of  the
    Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.   The appeal was  allowed
    on  human  rights  grounds,  the  Tribunal  being  satisfied  that  the
    Respondent's removal would be a disproportionate breach of her right to
    family life.  The Secretary of  State  now  has  permission  to  appeal
    against that decision, granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Parkes  on
    the 21st October 2015.


 2. The background facts, in brief summary, are that Ms  Altabieb  came  to
    the United Kingdom as a visitor in August 2014. Once here she met,  and
    in November 2014 married, a Mr Mohammad Abdulla Mohammed.  Mr  Mohammed
    is a Libyan national who has indefinite leave to remain in  the  United
    Kingdom. The parties state that they had  at  first  intended  that  Ms
    Altabieb should return to Libya in order to apply for  entry  clearance
    to join her husband. Two things changed their minds. The first was  the
    rapidly deteriorating security situation in Libya,  and  in  particular
    Tripoli; the second was that Ms Altabieb found that she  was  pregnant.
    So it was that under cover of letter dated 7th January 2015 she made an
    application for leave to remain 'outside of the  Rules'  on  Article  8
    grounds.

 3. The Secretary of State refused the application on the grounds  that  Ms
    Altabieb did not meet the requirements of the Rules and that there  was
    "nothing to prevent" her from making the journey back to  Tripoli  over
    land (it being conceded  that  she  could  not  fly  there,  commercial
    flights having been suspended after attacks at Tripoli  airport).   The
    Secretary of State took the view that she could return home and make an
    application for entry clearance in the normal way.

 4. Judge Birrell did not agree. Judge Birrell  was  referred  to  evidence
    that Libya is a "war zone" [at 19]. Ms Altabieb had  considered  making
    the journey by land via either Chad or Niger but  this  would  be  very
    difficult [21].   The route through Tunisia was now closed [23]. At the
    date of the appeal Ms  Altabieb  was  heavily  pregnant  [18  and  25].
    Having heard that evidence, and having  had  regard  to  the  objective
    country material placed before her, Judge Birrell found that  it  would
    not be reasonable for Ms Altabieb to return to  Libya  at  present.  In
    doing so she noted that there were a number of factors weighing against
    a grant of leave.

 5. Permission was granted on two grounds. The Secretary of  State  submits
    that the fact that the (then) appellant was pregnant was not a material
    factor. The Judge  should  have  focused  on  whether  she  could  have
    returned to Libya following the birth in order to make  an  application
    for entry clearance.  Secondly it is submitted that the Judge has  only
    engaged superficially with the public interest in this case.



    My Findings

 6. The public interest did weigh heavily against  Ms  Altabieb.   She  had
    come to the United Kingdom as a visitor, and the Rules contained an in-
    built 'no switching'  provision,  for  which  there  are  sound  public
    policy reasons. She had embarked on a relationship when her status  was
    precarious. She had made use of the services of the NHS  to  which  she
    was not entitled. Her husband was unable to support her  since  he  was
    only earning ï¿½80.00 per week working part-time in  a  pizza  restaurant
    and there was nothing to suggest that his employment prospects would be
    any better in the future. She did not meet the requirements of Appendix
    FM.  She cannot speak English. All of these factors cumulatively  meant
    that there was a substantial  weight  to  be  attached  to  the  public
    interest in this case.  That much is uncontroversial. The Secretary  of
    State cannot however demonstrate that these were matters that the First-
    tier Tribunal Judge excluded from her consideration.  As Mr Mills  very
    realistically conceded, they are all matters expressly addressed in the
    determination, in particular at paragraphs 36  and  37.   Ground  2  is
    therefore not made out. It cannot  be  said  that  this  constituted  a
    "superficial" assessment of the public interest since the Secretary  of
    State has not managed to identify any factor  which  should  have  been
    considered that has been omitted. The public interest  appears  at  the
    forefront of the Tribunal's analysis.


 7. Ground 1 appears to suggest that the Tribunal had impermissibly treated
    two factors as determinative: the fact that Ms Altabieb  was  pregnant,
    and the fact that she could no longer fly direct to Tripoli.  There  is
    no support for that proposition in the determination itself:  paragraph
    43 records that the Tribunal has taken  all  factors  into  account  in
    reaching its finding that there are  "compelling  reasons"  as  to  why
    leave should be granted.  What can be said is that these were important
    features of the evidence. The fact  that  Ms  Altabieb  would  have  to
    navigate her way overland via Chad or Niger - either  with  or  without
    her British baby- into Libya where the situation  was  "clearly  highly
    volatile" was demonstrably relevant.    If the Secretary  of  State  is
    looking for exceptional circumstances these were surely it.



    Decisions

 8. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not contain any  error  of
    law and the decision is upheld.

 9. I was not asked to make a direction for anonymity and on  the  facts  I
    see no reason to do so.
