For the Respondent:    Mr Kandola, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan, born on 14 December 1991.

 2. The appellant made an application for leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  4
    (General) Student on 31 March 2014 which was refused by the  respondent
    on 5 June 2014.  The respondent did not accept that the  appellant  met
    the requirements of paragraph 245ZX(c) in terms of  his  competency  in
    the English language, he failed to meet the requirements  of  paragraph
    245ZX(d) with regard to maintenance because he submitted a  false  bank
    statement and was further refused under paragraph  322(1A)  because  of
    the deception used.  Judge A J Parker (the Judge)  allowed  the  appeal
    because he found there was no evidence the bank statement was false and
    that, on the evidence before him, the appellant had passed his  English
    language test.

 3. The respondent appealed the Judge's decision.  The  grounds  claim  the
    Judge made a material error as follows:

         (a)  The appellant applied for a Tier 4 (General) visa having  been
             granted 60 days to enrol with a suitable  education  provider
             following the withdrawal of  the  licence  from  his  previous
             sponsor.  The fresh application was refused on  the  basis  of
             the appellant using a false bank statement under paragraph 320
             and because the Home  Office  could  not  access  his  English
             language test results.  Further, the application  was  refused
             on maintenance grounds as the false bank statement  could  not
             be relied upon.

         (b)  The grounds conceded the Secretary of State  did  not  produce
             evidence with regard to the document check which was  said  to
             show the bank statement was false, however, the judge erred in
             finding the statement was reliable.  It was not clear from the
             decision which bank statement was produced by the appellant at
             the hearing and what period it covered.  The grounds speculate
             that the judge was quite possibly precluded  from  considering
             that bank statement and indeed, he made a  self  direction  at
             [8] of the decision that s.19 of the UK Borders Act restricted
             the evidence that could be considered that was  not  submitted
             with the application.   It  was  entirely  unclear  what  bank
             statement was produced and whether any dates were  clear  that
             related to the date of the application in March 2014 or if  it
             had been submitted with  the  application.   The  judge  erred
             because he gave  no  clear  reasons  for  explaining  how  the
             appellant could meet the maintenance requirement.

         (c)  The judge also arguably erred in finding  that  the  appellant
             had properly passed an  approved  language  test.   The  judge
             noted that the appellant's evidence was that  he  assured  him
             there was  a  delay  in  the  result  being  uploaded  by  the
             organisation who provided the test but that was  not  evidence
             that could have been submitted with the application if it  was
             the appellant's case that the result was not available  online
             in June 2014 when the decision was taken,  but  was  available
             just before the hearing.  Further, the judge erred in  finding
             that despite the appellant being unable to meet the provisions
             of paragraph 276ADE, that it was possible for  a  freestanding
             assessment to be made.  The judge nowhere properly dealt  with
             why a student who had been in the United Kingdom for less than
             five years had a private life claim that  was  not  adequately
             covered by the Immigration Rules.  Even if the judge had  been
             able to conduct an assessment outside the Rules,  the  reasons
             for  finding   removal   disproportionate   were   inadequate,
             seemingly on the grounds that the appellant was  disadvantaged
             in making his application because the test  results  were  not
             put on line by his educational provider.

 4. Upper Tribunal Judge Martin granted permission to appeal on 8 May 2015.
     She found that it was arguable that:

      a) Although the Judge correctly rejected the  allegation  of  a  false
         document due to an absence of evidence from the Secretary of State,
         he erred because he did not make clear  the  basis  upon  which  he
         found the maintenance requirement to be met.

      b) The Judge erred in taking into  account  evidence  that  came  into
         existence after the date of the  decision,  that  is,  the  English
         language test result.

      c) In light  of  the  possible  errors  set  out  above,  the  Judge's
         conclusion   that   the   Secretary   of   State's   refusal    was
         disproportionate was in error.

 5. There was no Rule 24 response.

 6. The Judge's decision was promulgated on 16 March 2015.

Submissions on Error of Law

 7. Mr Kandola accepted that the respondent had failed to lodge a  document
    verification report but that was not the end of the matter  as  it  was
    incumbent upon the judge to make a decision on maintenance grounds.   A
    bank statement had been produced which the judge referred to at [9]  of
    his decision, however, there was no explanation from the judge in  that
    context as to why he pointed out s.19 of the UK Borders Act  restricted
    evidence that he could take into account.  Although the judge  referred
    to JF (para 320 refusal; substantive  rule?)  Bangladesh  [2008]  UKAIT
    00008, there was no  analysis  of  the  appellant's  circumstances  set
    against case law.  As regards the English  language  test  certificate,
    that was supplied post-decision such that the judge  erred  in  finding
    that the appellant had properly passed an approved language test.

 8. Mr Saini identified the relevant  issues,  the  fact  that  an  alleged
    fraudulent bank statement had been produced and that the appellant  had
    been unable to verify his English language test results.

 9. As regards the bank  statement,  Mr  Saini  drew  my  attention  to  MH
    (respondent's bundle: documents not provided) Pakistan [2010] UKUT  168
    (IAC).  That case was proposition for the obligation on the part of the
    respondent to supply a document to the Tribunal if it was mentioned  in
    the reasons for refusal or if it was relied upon.  The  bank  statement
    was at page 64 of the appellant's bundle.  It  was  dated  17  February
    2014  and  predated,  by  a  little  over  a  month,  the   appellant's
    application.  That being the case, the judge did not err in taking  the
    statement into account.

10. As regards the English language test, the appellant  was  unaware  that
    his details had not been uploaded to the Pearson website as of the date
    of his  application.   The  appellant  relied  upon  Naved  (student  -
    fairness - notice of points) [2012] UKUT 14 (IAC).  The appellant  said
    that it was an error on the part of the test  centre  not  to  put  his
    results online as of the date of the application.  Once he received the
    respondent's refusal  he  contacted  the  test  centre  such  that  the
    omission was remedied.

Conclusion on Error of Law

11. I find the judge erred with regard to the maintenance requirements  and
    the English language test results:

12. Maintenance.  The respondent said the appellant had failed to meet  the
    requirements of paragraph 245ZX(d) with regard to maintenance.  He  was
    required to show living costs of ï¿½9,000 but the bank statement at  page
    64 of the appellant's bundle had not been accepted as evidence of funds
    because according to the respondent it had been  proven  to  be  false.
    Whilst the judge was entitled to come to the conclusion that there  was
    no evidence the bank statement was false, he erred when he  engaged  no
    further with that document. The judge carried out no analysis as to how
    it was that the statement showed  the  appellant  met  the  maintenance
    requirements.   In  particular,  the  judge  carried  out  no  currency
    conversion exercise.  In such circumstances, I find the judge erred  in
    law.

13. English language test results.  The appellant's  application  indicated
    he had submitted a test report showing he had  sat  a  Pearson  English
    test.  It was a requirement for the  appellant  to  have  assigned  his
    Pearson  test  score  to  the  respondent  in  order  to  allow  online
    verification of the document.  When the respondent checked the  Pearson
    website on 5 June 2014 the appellant's score could not be verified.  It
    was explained by the appellant at the hearing  that  on  receiving  the
    refusal, he had spoken with the test centre who had  failed  to  upload
    the results.

14. The report indicates clearly on its face "Note  to  institutions:  This
    score report is not valid unless  authenticated  on  the  PTE  academic
    score report website: www.pearsonvue.com/ptescores."

15. The judge did not explain at [11] of his decision how, as of  the  date
    of the hearing he was able to find that the appellant  had  passed  the
    Pearson test, bearing in mind the lack of authentication online.

16. I next consider whether there was any obligation on the  respondent  to
    give the appellant the opportunity to comment, which is what the  judge
    said at [11].  It might be that  if  the  respondent  had  checked  the
    website after the appellant had raised  the  issue  with  Pearson,  she
    would have found the appellant's authenticated test score report there,
    but I do not accept that the process overall was  unfair  in  terms  of
    Naved. In my view, it was incumbent upon the appellant  to  ensure  his
    documentation was in order at the time of his  application.   This  was
    not a situation such as in Naved, where  the  application  was  refused
    because of the appellant's failure to produce a document  that  he  was
    never asked to produce.   On  the  contrary,  the  respondent  in  this
    appellant's case was clear in her requirements and  the  appellant  was
    under an obligation to ensure that the respondent's  requirements  were
    met.  The process did not become unfair vis-ï¿½-vis the appellant and the
    respondent because of the test centre's error.

17. At [12] the judge said that if his decision under the Immigration Rules
    was incorrect he would consider the appellant's rights under Article 8.
     The judge found that the appellant had no family  life.   In  allowing
    the appeal under Article 8, he  relied  upon  his  same  findings  with
    regard to the appeal under the Immigration Rules, which  he  said  made
    the respondent's decision disproportionate.  The judge failed  to  take
    into account that he had carried out no  analysis  of  the  maintenance
    requirements, set against what the bank statement revealed.  He said as
    regards s.117B that the appellant satisfied the requirement not to be a
    burden on the taxpayer, however, there was no  explanation  as  to  why
    that might be so.

18. The judge found as  regards  the  test  result  that  the  respondent's
    failure to give the  appellant  the  opportunity  to  comment  upon  or
    provide evidence that  he  had  passed  the  language  test  placed  an
    unjustifiable burden upon the appellant  whether  with  regard  to  the
    application process itself, the case law Naved or the process by  which
    the test provider made provision for the  authentication  of  its  test
    results, but there was no reasoned explanation as to why that might  be
    so.

19. The correct approach remains a two stage process. See Patel [2013] UKSC
    72 and Sunassee [2015] EWHC 1604 (Admin).  The Immigration  Rules  must
    be met.  If not,  then  the  public  interest  demands  the  appeal  is
    dismissed save for any issues  not  covered  by  the  Rules  which  are
    described as a "gap" between  the  Rules  and  Article  8  at  [36]  of
    Sunassee. It was incumbent upon the judge to  carry  out  an  analysis,
    explaining the gap (if  any)  between  the  Rules  and  Article  8  and
    carrying out a balancing exercise discussing the public  interest.  His
    analysis was inadequate in that  regard  such  that  his  findings  and
    conclusion erred in law.

Notice of Decision

20. The judge erred in allowing the appeal.  The appeal is remitted to  the
    First-tier Tribunal to be  re-heard  de  novo.   None  of  the  judge's
    findings shall stand.

Anonymity direction not made.
