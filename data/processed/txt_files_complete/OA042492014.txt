Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S Kandola, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal by the Appellant, a citizen of Somalia,  born  on  15
    June 1996, against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge  Robinson,
    who sitting at Hatton Cross on 24 October 2014 and in  a  determination
    subsequently promulgated on 5 December 2014, dismissed  the  appeal  of
    the Appellant, against the decision of the Respondent dated 24 February
    2014 to refuse her application for an entry clearance as the child of a
    relative present and settled in the United Kingdom.

2.   In refusing the Appellant's application, the  Respondent  took  account
    of the basis upon which the Appellant's previous application for  entry
    clearance had been refused in a decision dated 24 June  2011,  to  join
    the same Sponsor in the UK.

3.   It was noted in terms of the present  application  that  the  Appellant
    claimed that her mother had abandoned her  in  Ethiopia,  in  order  to
    assist her sister.

4.   In that  regard,  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  considered  that  the
    Appellant had provided inadequate evidence to satisfy him that this was
    the case and in any event it was not  understood  why  the  Appellant's
    claimed mother would not take the Appellant with her  on  her  travels,
    given that she was a minor.

5.   It was further noted that the  Appellant  had  failed  to  provide  any
    evidence that she had registered as a refugee in Ethiopia and that were
    she genuinely residing in serious  and  compelling  circumstances,  she
    would  have  been  expected  to  have  sought  the  assistance  of  the
    authorities.

6.   The Entry Clearance  Officer  was  therefore  not  satisfied  that  the
    Appellant did not have the support of family or friends  and  that  the
    Appellant did not continue to reside with the same people who had cared
    for her over the years.  As such, he was not satisfied inter alia, that
    the Appellant's circumstances were compassionate or  compelling  enough
    to warrant the issue of an  entry  clearance  in  accordance  with  the
    requirements of paragraph 297(i)  (f)  of  the  Immigration  Rules,  as
    amended.

7.   The Entry Clearance Officer had also  given  careful  consideration  to
    the Appellant's rights under Article 8 of the ECHR and  concluded  that
    whilst there might be a perceived interference, it would  be  justified
    in the interests of maintaining an effective  immigration  control  and
    thus proportionate and  appropriate.   There  appeared  to  be  nothing
    preventing the Appellant's Sponsor joining her in Ethiopia, should  she
    wish to do so.

8.   The First-tier Judge heard evidence from the  Appellant's  Sponsor  her
    sister,  that  together  with  the  Sponsor's  written  statement   was
    comprehensively taken into account in his consideration of the evidence
    in its totality and set out over paragraphs 6  to  16  of  the  Judge's
    determination.

9.   At paragraph 26 of his determination, the Judge was clear that  he  had
    carefully considered  the  evidence  relating  to  the  Appellant  that
    included her situation in Ethiopia and her claimed  dependency  on  the
    Sponsor.  Careful account was also taken  of  the  respective  parties'
    submissions.

10.  The First-tier Tribunal Judge explained that he  was  mindful  that  at
    the time of the present application, the Appellant was 17 years old and
    that her earlier application had been made at the  time  when  she  was
    living  with  her  mother  and  that  it  was  now  asserted  that  the
    Appellant's mother was no longer living with the Appellant and had gone
    missing.

11.  He further noted the claim that the Appellant was now living alone,  in
    which regard account was taken  of  the  Sponsor's  evidence.   It  was
    apparent to the First-tier Tribunal Judge that although the Sponsor was
    in regular contact with her mother, "she  received  no  telephone  call
    from her mother or the Appellant  advising  her  that  her  mother  was
    making a mercy dash to the border, leaving the Appellant alone".

12.  The Judge found for the reasons comprehensively set  out  at  paragraph
    29 of his determination, that the Sponsor's explanation for the lack of
    communication "namely that she  was  working  and  not  contactable  by
    phone", to be implausible.  He found it "improbable  that  the  Sponsor
    would not have been advised of events before her mother embarked on the
    journey".   Further,  "it  was  pertinent  that  the  Sponsor  had   no
    confirmation from any source indicating that  she  had  made  enquiries
    about her mother's whereabouts during the period she has been missing".



13.  At paragraph 30 of his determination and having  considered  the  issue
    of the Appellant's age and circumstances, the Judge did not accept that
    she had been abandoned by her mother.

14.  Further, her claim to be living in accommodation  without  electricity,
    water or heating and  to  be  living  in  destitution  or  impoverished
    circumstances at the time the application was made, was  not  credible.
    In that regard, it was apparent to the Judge that the Sponsor had  been
    sending sufficient funds; "to enable her two female relatives to obtain
    adequate accommodation.  I have noted that her mother and  sister  have
    mobile phones".

15.  It was observed that "a post-decision event  (had)  been  described  by
    the Sponsor" claiming that her sister was attacked  by  young  men  and
    rescued by passers-by.  It was observed that no  confirmatory  evidence
    in relation to this claim had been provided.  In any event,  given  the
    Judge's findings with regard to the disappearance  of  the  Appellant's
    mother, the Judge did not accept that the Appellant had shown that  she
    was at risk from young men in the area around her home.

16.  I pause there because  as  an  out-of-country  appeal,  the  First-tier
    Judge was solely concerned with the evidence before the Entry Clearance
    Officer as at the date of his decision, save to the  extent  that  post
    decision evidence might illuminate circumstances pertaining at the date
    of the decision.

17.  Whilst the Judge accepted that the Appellant and Sponsor  were  sisters
    as claimed and that there was "a strong family bond between  them  even
    if they had not seen each other for over three  years"  and  whilst  in
    consequence, he was able to conclude that the Appellant  satisfied  the
    requirements of paragraph 297 (iii), (iv) and  (v)  the  fact  remained
    that upon his consideration  of  the  evidence  in  its  totality,  the
    Appellant did not satisfy the requirements of paragraph 297  (i)(f)  of
    the Immigration Rules.

18.  Paragraph 297 of the Rules, sets out the requirements to be  met  by  a
    person seeking indefinite leave to enter the  United  Kingdom,  as  the
    child of a parent, parents or a relative present  and  settled  in  the
    United Kingdom, of which sub paragraph (i) (f) requires that he/she:

         "(i) is seeking leave to enter to accompany or join a  ..  relative
             in one of the following circumstances;

             (f)  (the) relative is  present  and  settled  in  the  United
                  Kingdom or being admitted on  the  same  occasion  of  the
                  settlement and there  are  serious,  compelling  or  other
                  considerations  which  make   exclusion   of   the   child
                  undesirable and suitable arrangements had been made to the
                  child's care."

19.  It is important to bear in mind, that  the  requirements  of  paragraph
    297 of the Immigration Rules (as amended) are cumulative and  mandatory
    so that a failure to meet any of the necessary required criteria  would
    thus be fatal to the outcome of the application.

20.  The Appellant successfully sought  permission  to  appeal  the  Judge's
    decision, having submitted, that notwithstanding  that  Article  8  was
    raised specifically as a ground of appeal before the First-tier  Judge,
    he failed to mention or consider it at all and thus materially erred in
    law.  Further, that the  Judge's  factual  findings  were  inadequately
    reasoned.

21.  In that latter regard, it was pointed out, that the  Judge  in  finding
    it to be not plausible that the Appellant had  lost  contact  with  her
    mother,  had  made  a  crucial  finding,  because  it   bore   on   his
    consideration of whether the Appellant was living  alone  in  the  most
    exceptional, compelling circumstances and whether  she  was  wholly  or
    mainly dependent on the Sponsor.

22.  It was submitted that the only reason that  the  Judge  had  given  for
    disbelieving this part of the Appellant's account was improbability and
    that this was not an  "appropriate,  safe  or  sustainable  reason  for
    rejecting  an  account  that  is  given  by  someone  who  is   fleeing
    persecution, a matter which (was) clear from the  Appellant's  minority
    clan status and Somali origin".

23.  Prior to the hearing before me and by letter dated 11 March  2015,  the
    Respondent filed with the Tribunal her  Rule  24  response,  submitting
    that the First-tier Judge directed himself properly and  gave  adequate
    reasons for rejecting the Appellant's  claim  to  be  living  alone  at
    paragraphs 29 and 30 of his determination.

24.  Thus the appeal came before me on 22 April 2015,  when  my  first  task
    was to decide whether or not the determination of the First-tier  Judge
    disclosed an error or errors on  a  point  of  law  such  as  may  have
    materially affected the outcome of the appeal.

25.  Having heard the parties' submissions I reserved my decision.

Assessment

26.  In the course  of  the  parties'  submissions  I  had  drawn  to  their
    attention the following cases:

           o Shizad (sufficiency of reasons: set aside) [2013]  UKUT  00085
             (IAC);

           o Budhathoki (reasons for decisions) [2014] UKUT 00341 (IAC).

27.  The head note in Shizad states as follows:

         "(1) Although there is a legal duty to give a brief explanation  of
             the conclusions on the central issue on  which  an  appeal  is
             determined,  those  reasons  need  not  be  extensive  if  the
             decision as a whole makes sense, having regard to the material
             accepted by the Judge.

         (2)  Although a decision may contain an  error  of  law  where  the
             requirements to give adequate reasons are not met,  the  Upper
             Tribunal would not normally set aside a decision of the First-
             tier Tribunal where there has been no misdirection of law, the
             fact-finding process cannot be  criticised  and  the  relevant
             Country Guidance has  been  taken  into  account,  unless  the
             conclusions the Judge draws from the  primary  data  were  not
             reasonably open to him or her."

28.  The head note in Budhathoki states:

         "It is generally unnecessary and unhelpful for First-tier  Tribunal
         judgments to rehearse every detail and issue raised  in  the  case.
         This leaves the Judgements becoming overly long and confused and is
         not a proportionate approach to deciding  cases.   It  is,  however
         necessary for Judges to identify and resolve key conflicts  in  the
         evidence and explain in clear and brief  terms  their  reasons,  so
         that the parties can understand why they have won or lost."

29.  I should add in that latter regard that the judgment in that  case  was
    given by Mr Justice Haddon-Cave who sitting as an Upper Tribunal  Judge
    also decided in VHR (unmeritorious grounds) Jamaica [2014]  UKUT  00367
    (IAC) as follows:

         "Appeals should not be mounted on the basis of a litany of forensic
         criticisms of  particular  findings  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal,
         whilst ignoring the basic legal test which  the  Appellant  has  to
         meet".

30.  Notwithstanding the  eloquent  submissions  made  by  Mr  Ball  on  the
    Appellant's behalf, I am satisfied on a careful reading of the  Judge's
    determination, that he did indeed identify and resolve key conflicts in
    the evidence and explained in clear and brief terms  his  reasons.   It
    cannot be said in such  circumstances  that  the  Appellant  could  not
    understand why she had lost.

31.  Further, insofar  as  the  Judge's  consideration  of  the  Appellant's
    immigration appeal was concerned, there has  been  no  misdirection  of
    law. Indeed the Judge at paragraph 24 of  his  determination  correctly
    recognised that the burden  of  proof  was  on  the  Appellant  to  the
    requisite standard.  Further, that he was  required  to  consider  "the
    circumstances appertaining at the time of the decision to refuse".

32.  As  to  the  submission  that  the  only  reason  the  Judge  gave  for
    disbelieving the Appellant's account was improbability  and  that  this
    was neither safe, appropriate or sustainable,  I  have  considered  the
    guidance in SR (Iran) [2007] EWCA Civ 460 where  although  I  recognise
    that this discussion is in the contest of an immigration appeal, it  is
    clear that what Sedley LJ had to say in referring to  "this  field"  at
    paragraph 9 did not restrict  the  applicability  of  his  comments  at
    paragraphs 9 and 10 below to those errors alone.  Sedley  LJ  had  this
    inter alia to say:

         "9.  The law does not demand, at least in  this  field,  that  each
             finding  of  fact,  whatever  its  degree  of   certainty   or
             uncertainty, be fitted into a single matrix of risk.  The fact-
             finder's task is, to the extent made possible by the evidence,
             to find facts, and some facts are more  certain  than  others.
             It would have been as unjust to the Appellant to treat as mere
             possibilities things which, on the AIT's findings, were highly
             likely as it would  have  been  to  the  Respondent  to  treat
             possibilities of hardship as probabilities.

         10.  The critical adjudicative task is to assemble  these  findings
             into an evaluation which answers the question  posed  by  law.
             In asylum and human rights claims, that  is  the  question  of
             real risk and it is at the point of decision  and  not  sooner
             that it arises."

33.  It was Mr Ball's  submission  that  there  was  no  logical  connection
    between the serious nature of the events (namely  a  serious  emergency
    that caused the Appellant's mother to rush off to deal with it) and the
    fact that the Sponsor said in evidence that she was working and did not
    have her telephone switched on.  He submitted that the  seriousness  of
    an incident did not increase the likelihood  that  someone  might  have
    their phone off.  Thus it was not just the lack of connection that  was
    the problem but the reference by the Judge to  implausibility  that  Mr
    Ball  maintained  was  not  "the  appropriate  yardstick".   A  similar
    criticism applied to the Judge's finding that it  was  improbable  that
    the Sponsor would not have been advised of  events  before  her  mother
    embarked on her journey.

34.  Mr Ball cited HK [2006] EWCA  Civ  1037  but  in  so  doing  failed  to
    appreciate that this was a case that was  primarily  concerned  with  a
    Judge's approach to credibility in terms of asylum cases.

35.  He also referred to Y [2006] EWHC 1223 (Admin), but failed  to  mention
    that in that case it was also said that a decision-maker  was  entitled
    to regard an account as incredible by drawing on  his  own  commonsense
    and his ability to identify as a practical and informed person what was
    and what was not  plausible.   I  find  that  this  was  precisely  the
    exercise with which the First-tier Judge in the present case, engaged.

36.  As correctly identified by the Judge in the present case, the onus  and
    burden of proof was upon the Appellant and I am  reminded  that  in  MM
    [2005] UKIAT 0019, Mr Justice Ouseley, then the President of  the  IAC,
    held that the fact that there might be an alternative  explanation  for
    matters that a Judge found inherently improbable  did  not  demonstrate
    that negative credibility findings were legally erroneous.  It was  for
    the Appellant to provide the explanation.

37.  In Malaba [2006] EWCA Civ 820 it was pointed out that in assessing  the
    adequacy of a fact-finding exercise,  an  Appellate  Tribunal  expected
    findings to be adequately reasoned and that such reasoning on the  part
    of the Judge not only told the losing party why  he/she  had  lost  but
    might also be able  to  demonstrate  that  he/she  had  adequately  and
    conscientiously addressed the issue of factors that had arisen.  Again,
    I find that is precisely the approach taken by the Judge in  this  case
    as is apparent from a reading of his determination.

38.  In that regard I would agree with Mr Kandola,  who  submitted  that  in
    terms of the Judge's  use  of  "improbability"  in  his  findings,  and
    mindful of the guidance in Y (above) and HK (above),  it  was  apparent
    from those cases that it was not impermissible  to  use  improbability,
    though not permissible to use UK standards  as  to  reasonableness,  in
    terms of what would happen in the United Kingdom. However on the  facts
    as found in the present case, the Judge was entitled to take account of
    the fact that contacting close relatives  about  a  drastic  change  of
    circumstances where both parties had the benefit of a mobile  telephone
    and yet failing to contact each other, was both  open  to  him  on  the
    evidence and could not be regarded as reasoning that applied  a  purely
    UK cultural  standard.   The  Judge  was  entitled  to  take  a  global
    assessment taking into account the failure of the Appellant's mother to
    contact the Sponsor and as to the surrounding circumstances.

39.  It was also Mr Ball's submission that there was no evidence upon  which
    the Judge found that he considered that the amount of money provided by
    the Sponsor to her mother and the Appellant would have been  sufficient
    to provide them with adequate accommodation as Somalis in Ethiopia.  He
    submitted that the Judge could not take  judicial  notice  of  what  he
    considered to be monthly rent in Addis Ababa.

40.  I am unpersuaded by that submission.  It was  common  ground  that  the
    Appellant and her mother had accommodation  in  Ethiopia  and  in  that
    regard received a monthly remittance from her daughter, the Sponsor.  I
    make the further observation  that  as  the  Sponsor  did  not  say  in
    evidence that the money that she sent to her mother was not enough,  it
    was open to the First-tier Tribunal Judge to conclude  that  the  money
    was to provide for adequate accommodation.

41.  There was no evidence before the First-tier Tribunal  Judge,  that  the
    Appellant's mother was working in Ethiopia but there was evidence  that
    both the Sponsor and her mother had the benefit of mobile phones and no
    evidence that either phone had failed.  As I pointed out  to  Mr  Ball,
    whilst it might have been the case that the Sponsor as a  nurse  worked
    twelve hour shifts, this could not possibly mean that at all times  the
    Sponsor and mother  were  unable  to  speak  to  each  other  on  their
    respective mobile phones at other hours of the day or night and further
    bearing in mind the time difference  between  the  United  Kingdom  and
    Ethiopia.

42.  I find therefore that it was properly open to  the  Judge  to  conclude
    over paragraphs 29 and 30  of  his  determination  that  the  Sponsor's
    explanation for the lack of communication, namely that she was  working
    and not contactable by phone, was implausible, not least  in  light  of
    the serious nature of the claimed events  that  further  supported  his
    conclusion that the  Appellant  and  her  mother  were  not  living  in
    destitution or impoverished circumstances at the time  the  application
    was made.

43.  I would further point out that it is not sufficient  for  an  Appellant
    to say that she does not agree with a Judge's findings  and  wishes  to
    challenge the factual decision which has been reached.  It is  apparent
    to me that the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  was  clear  as  to  what  he
    thought of each aspect of the evidence and at what level of  certainty,
    and only at paragraphs 33 and 34 of  his  determination,  did  he  draw
    together all of these findings and reach his conclusion  in  accordance
    with precisely the approach as set  out  by  Sedley  LJ  in  SR  (Iran)
    (above).

44.  I find therefore upon a reading of the determination as  a  whole  that
    it cannot even arguably be said that the Judge failed to take  relevant
    material into account or that his decision was perverse  or  irrational
    in the Wednesbury sense.

45.  I now address the Appellant's assertion that  the  Judge's  failure  to
    deal specifically with the issue of Article 8  of  the  ECHR  that  was
    raised in the original grounds of appeal, constituted a material  error
    of law.  For this purpose I begin by observing that it was in a  letter
    from the Appellant's solicitors to the British Embassy in  Addis  Ababa
    dated 20 January 2014 that the issue of Article 8 was first  raised  on
    behalf of the Appellant but solely in generalised and  formulaic  terms
    in which a list of case law references were cited but where no  attempt
    was made to demonstrate as to how the cases relied upon  were  relevant
    to the particular circumstances  of  the  Appellant  or  dealt  in  any
    meaningful way with the Respondent's decision.

46.  More particularly, the original grounds of appeal made only the  barest
    of reference to Article 8 by stating that the Entry Clearance Officer's
    decision was "unlawful because it was incompatible with the Appellant's
    rights under Article 8 of the Human Rights Act 1998  and  the  European
    Convention on Human Rights".  Thus, no attempt was  made  within  those
    barest of grounds to engage in Article 8  terms  with  the  Appellant's
    particular circumstances. Those grounds  I  observe,  added  the  words
    "further grounds may follow" but as such  they  failed  to  disclose  a
    ground of appeal.

47.  At the outset of the hearing before me, I asked Mr  Ball  (whom  I  was
    aware did not represent the Appellant before  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge) whether the Article 8 issue was specifically raised  before  him
    at that hearing.  Mr Ball informed me that he was not aware whether  or
    not it was so raised.  He maintained however that "the single reference
    to Article 8 in the original grounds was  enough  to  raise  it  as  an
    issue".  He further maintained that it was "Robinson  obvious"  on  the
    basis of the facts as presented. Whilst there was common ground between
    myself and the parties that in terms of Article 8 the  Judge  erred  in
    law in failing to consider it within his determination (indeed  s.86(2)
    of the 2002 Act requires in mandatory  terms  that  the  Tribunal  must
    determine any matter raised as a ground of  appeal)  the  fact  remains
    that this issue was not particularised to the Judge as to the nature of
    the claim and therefore there cannot have been a material error.  There
    is nothing in  the  determination  to  suggest  that  this  matter  was
    specifically raised by the Appellant's representative before the  Judge
    and it is not an appropriate challenge to a First-tier Judge's  finding
    to seek to raise issues that were not specifically put  before  him  at
    the hearing and barely raised in the grounds of appeal and  thus  after
    the appeal has been heard.

48.  Further, and more particularly, given the Judge's  sustainable  finding
    that the Appellant was not alone in Ethiopia, it would follow that  she
    continued to have family life there with her mother.

49.  However, it is contended on behalf of the  Appellant,  that  it  was  a
    breach of the Appellant's claimed family life with her sister to refuse
    her  entry  clearance  and   that   it   was   thus   disproportionate,
    notwithstanding that the Appellant was found not to meet  the  relevant
    terms of paragraph 297 of the Immigration  Rules,  such  that  she  was
    found to be, not living alone and had family life with her  mother  and
    was not destitute. It was submitted that she should  nevertheless  have
    been given entry clearance to  live  with  her  sister  in  the  United
    Kingdom. As Mr Kandola rightly submitted, that could not  be  made  out
    and was simply not material and that thus "such a claim would have been
    hopeless".

50.   I  would  add  that  if  the  claim  was  intended  to  amount  to  an
    interference with the right to promote and  develop  family  life,  the
    fact was and is, that the Appellant was very nearly  an  adult  at  the
    time of her application and  had  been  living  apart  from  her  adult
    sibling for many years.  In that regard, I am mindful of  the  guidance
    in Advic v the United Kingdom, (Application  No.00025525/94)  in  which
    the Commission pointed out that the protection of  Article  8  did  not
    cover links between adult siblings who had been living apart  for  long
    periods of time and they noted in the case of Advic when the  applicant
    made his application for an entry clearance his only close relative  in
    the United Kingdom was his brother from whom  the  applicant  had  been
    separated since 1975.  In such circumstances the Commission  considered
    that it had not been shown that there existed sufficient links  between
    the applicant and his relatives residing in the United Kingdom to  give
    rise to protection of Article 8.  It follows that there was  no  breach
    of the applicant's right to respect for his  private  and  family  life
    within the meaning of Article 8 on the part of the United Kingdom.

51.  Thus, in the present case, while the Appellant fell to be  assessed  as
    an individual under the age of 18 and therefore a minor, it would  have
    had to have been borne in mind that would only have just been the case.
     As a consequence of the decision under appeal, there would  have  been
    an engagement of rights protected by Article 8 given that  it  appeared
    the Appellant had been separated  from  her  Sponsor  sister  for  many
    years.  It is thus difficult to see how the decision under appeal could
    have  interfered  with  the  Appellant's  Article  8  rights   and   in
    circumstances where since the Appellant appealed  for  entry  clearance
    was refused, she was now in the same position as she was before  making
    the application.

52.  I would further observe that where a  claimant  fails  to  establish  a
    substantive right to enter the United  Kingdom  under  the  Immigration
    Rules she would have to put forward evidence of a  private/family  life
    of such significance so as to show that refusal of such entry clearance
    would be disproportionate.

53.  It is apparent, given the findings of the Judge in the present case  in
    terms of the Appellant's  immigration  appeal,  that  the  claim  under
    Article 8, even if it had been considered, would  have  been  bound  to
    fail.

54.  In conclusion I find this is not a case where the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge's reasoning in terms of the Appellant's immigration  appeal  were
    such that the Tribunal were unable to understand the thought  processes
    he employed in reaching his decision.  (See R (Iran)  [2005]  EWCA  Civ
    982).

55.  I find that in that  regard  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  properly
    identified and recorded the matters that he considered to  be  critical
    to his decision on the  material  issues  raised  before  him  in  this
    appeal.

Decision

56.  The making of the previous decision involved the making of no error  on
    a point of law such as to be material to the outcome and I  order  that
    it shall stand.

57.  No anonymity direction is made.
