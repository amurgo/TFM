                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant: Mr B Sharma (Legal Representative, MAAS)
For the Respondent: Ms J Isherwood (Home Office Presenting Officer)

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. The Appellant applied for entry clearance to the UK as a spouse. In a
   Refusal Notice of the 16th of December 2014 the ECO refused the
   application on the basis that the Sponsor's income did not meet the
   threshold set in Appendix FM and the savings were not sufficient to make
   up the shortfall. The appeal was heard by Judge Gillespie who dismissed
   the appeal on the same grounds.

2. The grounds of application to the First-tier Tribunal for permission to
   appeal to the Upper Tribunal argued that the appeal was governed by the
   new section 85A of the 2002 and was not limited to the date of the
   decision, evidence of the Sponsor's ISA had been incorrectly excluded and
   the approach to article 8 and section 55 was wrong given that the
   Appellant's and Sponsor's child had been born in the UK a month before
   the decision. Permission was granted by Judge Page on the 10th of October
   2016 without expressing a view on the issues raised.

3. The submissions made before the Upper Tribunal are set out in the Record
   of Proceedings. The thrust of the Appellant's submissions were that
   evidence of the Sponsor's ISA had been included in the papers submitted
   to the ECO and so fell to be considered under the terms of Appendix FM
   and FM-SE.

4. The Respondent's position is that the evidence of the saving account
   relied on did not the meet the requirements for specified evidence. The
   letters of the 2nd of October 2014 and the 14th of August 2014 were snap
   shots of the account were not 6 months of bank statements showing a
   continuous balance as required by paragraph 11 of Appendix FM-SE. The
   evidence required to justify taking the savings into account

5. Given the date of the decision and the date of the Grounds of Appeal to
   the First-tier Tribunal the first point made in the application for
   permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal is wrong. This case was
   considered under the old rules and it was the date of the decision at
   which matters had to be assessed.

6. That would not have made any difference in this case as there is a 2
   stage process that all Appellants have to meet. Firstly they have to
   provide the evidence mandated in Appendix FM-SE. If that evidence is not
   provided that is itself a failure to meet the Immigration Rules and would
   justify a refusal of an application even if other evidence that fell
   outside the definition of specified evidence had been submitted and
   showed by other means sufficient funds.


7. If the specified evidence is submitted then to succeed that evidence
   must show that the Sponsor earns over ï¿½18,600 or has sufficient savings
   to make up any shortfall. The fact that an Appellant's evidence may show
   that at a later date the rules can be met does not affect the position
   with regard to the evidence submitted with, and the decision, on the
   evidence submitted with the application.

8. The letters of the 2nd of October 2014 and the 14th of August 2014
   relating to the Sponsor's account ending "495" are not statements and
   clearly do not show what the balance was throughout the required period.
   I have considered whether paragraph 245AA would have applied but as these
   are 2 separate letters and not individual statements taken from a series
   I am satisfied that paragraph 245AA would not have applied. In any event
   those statements have not been provided by the Appellant or Sponsor at
   any stage in the proceedings.

9. If the ECO and the First-tier Tribunal Judge did err in overlooking the
   evidence relating to the Sponsor's ISA account that would not have been
   material as the evidence relating to the saving account "495" did not
   meet the definition of specified evidence and was not caught by the
   evidential flexibility provisions. Given that it cannot be said what was
   in that account between the dates of the 2 letters it could not be said
   that the funds had been held continuously. It follows that the Appellant
   had not shown that the Sponsor had sufficient funds for a continuous
   period of 6 months as required by the rules in Appendix FM-SE.

10. The fact that the Appellant and Sponsor have had a child would not have
   affected the decision. The Judge had to apply the rules and article 8 is
   not a free-standing by-pass to them. The financial requirements have been
   upheld in the Court of Appeal and compelling reasons would be required to
   justify a finding that the public interest in the maintenance of
   immigration control was outweighed.


11. The Appellant and Sponsor cannot be said to be victims of circumstances
   but are in a situation of their own making. The Judge was entitled to
   find that the decision was proportionate. The Appellant can re-apply and
   ensure that the evidence provided in support of the application meets all
   of the requirements of the Immigration Rules.

12. In summary whilst there may have been an error in the approach of the
   ECO and the First-tier Tribunal Judge that was not material as the
   documentation provided by the Appellant and Sponsor did not meet the
   requirements of the Immigration Rules. The decision was justified under
   the rules and article 8 and there was no material error in the decision
   under appeal.


CONCLUSIONS

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the
making of an error on a point of law.

I do not set aside the decision.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of
the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005 and I make no
order.

Fee Award

In dismissing this appeal I make no fee award.

Deputy Judge of the Upper Tribunal (IAC)
