Representation:
For the Appellants:    Miss Pickering of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mrs Petterson a Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

      1. The Respondent refused the Appellants' applications  for  leave  to
         enter as the children of a person present and settled  here  on  16
         July 2015. Their appeal against this was  dismissed  by  First-tier
         Tribunal Judge Khan ("the Judge") following a hearing  on  21  July
         2016.

      2. In summary the Judge found that the Appellants had not  established
         that their father here had sole responsibility for  them  following
         the death of their mother in 2008.

The grant of permission

      3. Judge Froom granted permission to appeal (23 November 2016) on  the
         ground that it is arguable that the Judge erred in misapplying  the
         Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules HC 395 ("the rules").

Respondent's position

      4. Mrs Petterson  agreed  that  the  Judge  materially  erred  in  not
         considering [297(i)(d)] of the rules and consequently  [297(iii)  -
         (v)], as, given it was found  that  their  mother  had  died,  this
         alternative avenue was open to them beyond [297(f)] which  was  the
         only rule considered by the Judge.

Discussion

      5. Given the concession made by Mrs Petterson, I am satisfied  that  a
         material error of law occurred. Both  representatives  agreed  that
         given this clear error, and the lack of any findings on the matters
         identified in [297(iii) - (v)], it was appropriate for the case  to
         be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for it to be heard afresh by
         a Judge other than Judge Khan.

Decision:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

    I set aside the decision.

    I remit the matter to the First-tier Tribunal to be heard  by  a  Judge
    other than Judge MA Khan.
