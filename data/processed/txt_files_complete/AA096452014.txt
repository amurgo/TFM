Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr I Palmer, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr T Wilding, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DECISION ON ERROR OF LAW

1.   The appellant has been granted permission to  appeal  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Hodgkinson who in a  determination  dated  11
    February 2015 dismissed the appellant's appeal against the decision  of
    the respondent made on 23 October 2014 to refuse to grant him asylum in
    the UK and to remove him from the United Kingdom.

2.   The appellant is a Kurdish citizen of Iran born  on  10  January  1995.
    He arrived in the UK, illegally, on 6 January 2011, a few  days  before
    his 16th birthday and applied for asylum on 10  January  2011.   On  11
    March 2011 his asylum  application  was  refused  but  he  was  granted
    discretionary leave to remain until 10 July  2012  because  he  was  an
    unaccompanied minor.

3.   On 9 July 2012 he made an application for leave to remain, the  refusal
    of which is the subject of this appeal.

4.   The judge rejected the appellant's account  of  political  activity  by
    his father who, he  claimed,  was  an  active  member  of  the  Kurdish
    Democratic Party  (KDP).   The  judge  also  rejected  the  appellant's
    account that in December 2010 the Iranian authorities had raided  their
    home, arrested his father and his friends who were  meeting  there  and
    had executed them.  The judge also rejected the appellant's claim  that
    he had assisted his father by distributing KDP leaflets.   The  judge's
    adverse credibility findings were comprehensive.  These  findings  have
    not been challenged and are to stand.

5.   The grounds upon which permission was granted  argued  that  the  judge
    failed to consider the particularised evidence of material  before  the
    Tribunal regarding the screening and a risk of arrest at the airport of
    returnees meeting the appellant's description.  The  challenge  was  in
    relation to the judge's finding at  paragraph  45  but  I  shall  quote
    paragraph 44 as well as follows:

         "44. Further in paragraph 3 of his  skeleton  argument,  Mr  Palmer
             cites additional country material, which  makes  reference  to
             the screening of returned, failed asylum seekers and,  indeed,
             a country guidance decision  in  SB  makes  reference  to  the
             increased adverse interest in Kurds deemed to  be  opposed  to
             the regime in Iran.  I was referred to  the  respondent's  own
             Operational  Guidance  Note  of  October  2012,  which   makes
             reference to Iranians arriving in  Iran  without  a  passport,
             and/or any valid travel document, being arrested and taken  to
             the airport court.  However, I  bear  in  mind  that,  in  the
             present instance, the appellant would not be returned  without
             a valid travel document, as he would not be removed without an
             emergency travel document having been issued  to  him  by  the
             Iranian authorities.

         45.  In his skeleton argument, Mr Palmer also relies upon a  report
             of the Immigration and Review Board of Canada  of  20  January
             2014, but that  report  relates  to  the  treatment  of  anti-
             government activists, and I have concluded that the  appellant
             is not an activist, and never has been.  Whilst I  acknowledge
             that his connection to the United Kingdom  is  an  aggravating
             feature, as is his Kurdish ethnicity  and  his  illegal  exit,
             there is no country material brought  to  my  attention  which
             causes me to conclude these factors such that it is reasonably
             likely that the appellant himself will suffer  persecution  or
             adverse interest in the event of his removal to Iran where,  I
             conclude, he can return to live in his home  village,  bearing
             in mind my findings of fact."

6.   Mr. Palmer relied on his grounds which argued that  country  background
    material was expressly set out or referenced in his skeleton which  was
    before the judge.  Mr Palmer relied on the COIS Report on failed asylum
    seekers  at  32.27  which  relies  on  an  extract  from   an   Amnesty
    International Report about how failed asylum seekers who  are  returned
    to Iran are perceived and treated.  They could be prosecuted for making
    up  accounts  of  alleged  persecution.   On  26  April  2011,   Kayhan
    Newspaper, which is controlled by the office  of  the  supreme  leader,
    also reported that Iranians  are  seeking  asylum  on  the  pretext  of
    supporting the opposition.  I note that the judge did not  specifically
    refer to the COIS Report and there was no indication that he had  taken
    this evidence into account.

7.   Mr Palmer also relied on the  Home  Office  Operational  Guidance  Note
    v.8.0 (October 2012) which states inter alia  at  3.15.5  that  "If  an
    Iranian arrives in the country, without a passport or any valid  travel
    documents, the official will arrest them and  take  them  to  [Mehrabad
    Airport] court."  I note that the judge at paragraph 44 made  reference
    to this report.

8.   Relying on those reports Mr Palmer said in his grounds  that  there  is
    therefore no need for an appellant to  have  a  particular  profile  to
    attract arrest, detention and investigation and/or prosecution.  It was
    clear from the objective reports  that  returnees  in  the  appellant's
    circumstances  would  be  arrested,  detained  and   investigated.   He
    submitted that the appellant's connection to the UK is likely to be  an
    aggravating feature and relied on paragraphs 24 and 51 of SB  (risk  on
    return - illegal exit) Iran CG [2009]  UKAIT  00053  (and  "SB").   His
    illegal exit would heighten the risk.

9.   Mr Palmer relied on a judicial review decision by Upper Tribunal  Judge
    Allen in the case of Ali Ahmed Rashid v Secretary of State for the Home
    Department IJR [2015] UKUT 00430 (IAC).  He  submitted  that  reference
    was made in Rashid to Professor Joff�'s report which addressed risk  to
    Kurds, not only on the basis of political activism but simply  by  dint
    of being Kurds.  UTJ Allen held that the fact is that Professor Joff�'s
    report is a generic report and does contain and refer to evidence which
    would have to be considered seriously by the putative First-tier Judge.
     UTJ Allen held that although there is endorsement of  the  conclusions
    in SB in the later decisions of BA and SA, he  did  not  think  it  was
    properly open to the respondent  to  conclude  that  Professor  Joff�'s
    report was  not  sufficient  to  warrant  departing  from  the  country
    guidance findings.

10.  Mr Palmer submitted that Professor Joff�'s report was before the First-
    tier Judge.  At paragraphs 92 to 96 Professor Joff�'s considered return
    to Iran by failed asylum seekers.  He did refer to unsuccessful  asylum
    seekers who are usually returned on travel documents furnished  by  the
    Iranian Embassy in the country in which they sought asylum.   This  was
    the finding made by the judge at paragraph 44.  Dr Joff�  said  that  a
    person who has left Iran illegally will be screened and  arrested  upon
    return.  He or she will then be  passed  to  a  special  court  at  the
    airport which will adjudicate on the  issue  of  illegal  departure  in
    accordance with Article 34  of  the  Iranian  Penal  Code.   At  95  he
    referred to Kurds who have fled Iran and are  frequently  suspected  of
    having had political reasons for doing so and are treated  accordingly.
    At 96 he said that the  Iranian  authorities  assume  that  all  asylum
    seekers who are returned to Iran have engaged in anti-regime activities
    whilst abroad, especially in  spreading  false  information  about  the
    Islamic Republic.  Mr.  Palmer  submitted  that  the  judge  failed  to
    consider the evidence contained in the report.

11.  I accept Mr Wilding's submission that the appellant's account  of  past
    events has been rejected by the judge.  I also  accept  his  submission
    that the judge found at paragraph 44 that the appellant  would  not  be
    returned to Iran without a valid travel document having been issued  to
    him by the Iranian authorities.   I find however that the  judge  erred
    in what he said at paragraph 45. I find  that  the  objective  evidence
    relied on by Mr. Palmer was in the  appellant's  bundle  and  had  been
    drawn to the judge's attention.  The objective evidence was material in
    relation to how a failed asylum seeker is perceived and treated by  the
    authorities on return Iran and the assumptions  of  political  activity
    attributed to them by the  authorities.   The  objective  evidence  was
    material to the assessment of risk on return.  The judge's  failure  to
    consider the objective evidence was a material flaw in his decision.

12.  The judge's decision on risk on return cannot stand.  The  decision  is
    set aside in order for it to be remade.

13.  The judge's rejection  of  the  appellant's  credibility  of  his  past
    accounts will stand.

14.  The issue the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  will  need  to  consider  is
    whether in the light of the objective evidence, the Appellant is likely
    to be at risk of persecution on his return to Iran as a  failed  asylum
    seeker.

Directions

The appeal is remitted to Hatton Cross to be heard  by  a  First-tier  Judge
