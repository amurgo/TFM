                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms P Yong, instructed by Wimbeldon Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS




   1. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Chana  dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal
      against the refusal by the respondent of his asylum  and  humanitarian
      appeal.


   2. Permission to appeal that decision was granted  by  designated  First-
      tier Tribunal Judge I Murray who identified evidence that  was  before
      Judge Chana which should have, but had not, been considered.


   3. In her Rule 24 response the respondent stated she did not  oppose  the
      appeal given the failure of Judge Chana to refer to any of the medical
      reports and invited the Upper Tribunal to allow the appeal  and  remit
      the  appeal  against  the  respondent's  decision  to  the  First-tier
      Tribunal to be heard by an First-tier Tribunal judge other than  judge
      Chana.


   4. Having considered the decision of Judge Chana and  the  evidence  that
      was before her and not considered by her I am  satisfied  there  is  a
      material error of law in her decision.


   5. I set aside the decision and  remit  the  hearing  to  the  First-tier
      Tribunal for a fresh decision, no findings preserved.
