                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of China born on the 18th  September  1985.
    He appeals against the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge
    Pickup) to dismiss his appeal against a decision to refuse him leave on
    protection grounds.


 2. In considering whether to grant permission to the Upper Tribunal, First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Keane said this: "the grounds amounted to  no  more
    than a disagreement with the findings of the judge, an attempt  to  re-
    argue the appeal and they did not disclose an arguable error  of  law".
    He did however find  that  the  determination  gave  rise  to  what  he
    regarded as a Robinson obvious[1] point:


         'did any procedural irregularity or unfairness arise from the  fact
         that Judge Pickup had already had some involvement in this case, in
         his capacity as a Deputy Judge of the Upper Tribunal?'


 3. The salient facts are these.


 4. The Applicant's appeal was  originally  heard  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Smith on the 6th March 2017. His claim was that he faced a  well-
    founded fear of persecution in  China  for  reasons  of  his  religious
    belief, said to arise from his membership of the  'Church  of  Almighty
    God' (CAG or COG).   It had been accepted that adherents of this  faith
    do face persecution in China so the only issue before Judge  Smith  was
    whether the Appellant was a practising adherent as claimed. Judge Smith
    found that he wasn't and dismissed the appeal.

 5. The matter came before Judge Pickup, sitting in the Upper Tribunal. The
    appeal was settled by consent, with the Respondent accepting that Judge
    Smith had erred in two respects.    Judge  Smith  had  found  that  the
    Appellant had been unable to  give  an  exposition  of  two  particular
    aspects of CAG theology when asked; this was an error of  fact  because
    the asylum interview record showed that in fact an accurate explanation
    had been given.  Second, it was agreed that the Tribunal had overlooked
    two articles published online that had been "written by  the  Appellant
    for his church" (I take this quote from  Counsel's  grounds  of  appeal
    dated the 14th May 2017). Judge Pickup decided that these  errors  went
    to the heart of the credibility findings made by Judge Smith, which  in
    turn had gone to the heart of the appeal. He therefore decided to remit
    the matter for hearing de novo in the First-tier Tribunal.

 6. When the matter came back before the First-tier Tribunal  it  came,  by
    what I believe was coincidence, before Judge Pickup, this time  sitting
    as a Judge of the First-tier Tribunal.  Counsel who  appeared  for  the
    Appellant was Ms G. Patel, who had appeared  before  Judge  Smith,  had
    drafted the grounds to the Upper Tribunal, and who had appeared  before
    Judge Pickup in the Upper Tribunal  hearing.   Given  that  history  Ms
    Patel obviously knew that Judge Pickup had dealt with the case  in  the
    Upper Tribunal. She made no objection to his now dealing with the  case
    in the First-tier Tribunal. She was perfectly correct not to have  done
    so. There is in principle no reason why he should not  have  heard  the
    case. Afterall, it would have been open to him to remake  the  decision
    in the appeal sitting  as  a  Deputy  of  the  Upper  Tribunal.   I  am
    satisfied that there was no  arguable  procedural  impropriety  in  the
    matter proceeding before Judge Pickup.

 7. Judge Pickup heard the appeal, but by his written  decision  dated  the
    16th March 2019 decided to dismiss it. He made various adverse findings
    against the Appellant, but his findings can broadly  be  summarised  as
    follows: the  Appellant  had  given  inconsistent  evidence  about  his
    claimed history of persecution,  he  was  unable  to  give  a  detailed
    explanation as to why he had joined this church, his current attendance
    at a protestant church in the United Kingdom was inconsistent with  his
    claimed adherence to CAG which has markedly different - and exclusive -
    theology, and he had demonstrated a general lack of  awareness  of  the
    CAG faith. As to documents  produced  by  the  Appellant  Judge  Pickup
    found, upon Tanveer Ahmed assessment, that  these  were  unreliable  or
    added little to the claim.

 8. There were two passages in  the  determination  which  concerned  Judge
    Keane. The first is at �29:

         "One of the grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal was that  Judge
         Smith failed to take account  of  the  two  articles  said  in  the
         grounds to have been written by the appellant and demonstrating his
         knowledge of and reasoned adherence to the COG"

 9. Having made that  observation  Judge  Pickup  goes  on  to  record  the
    Appellant's denial before him that he was in fact the author  of  those
    articles, and to draw adverse inference from the inconsistency  on  the
    point. Judge Keane's concern, I assume, was that  in  identifying  that
    discrepancy Judge Pickup had drawn upon his earlier involvement in  the
    case, in particular his knowledge of Ms Patel's grounds.


10. If that was his concern, I am satisfied that it is  misplaced.     Even
    if the determining Judge had had no prior involvement in the appeal  it
    would have been plain that there was an inconsistency in the  evidence.
    The index to the Appellant's bundle described the articles as "articles
    written by the Appellant and its English  translations".  The  articles
    themselves bore the Appellant's name, and in one case, his  photograph.
    It was therefore plainly open to Judge Pickup -or any other Judge -  to
    draw adverse inference from the fact that the Appellant was now denying
    involvement in authorship.


11. The second paragraph in issue is paragraph 39:

         "The appellant was refused an adjournment in the previous appeal in
         order to get the original of the document at  A42,  translation  at
         A41. Apart from the fact I am not satisfied  that  the  translation
         has been by a certified translator,  I  find  I  can  place  little
         reliance on this document even though the  so-called  original  was
         produced with an envelope showing something sent from China to  the
         appellant's home address in Bolton.  The document is something that
         could have been produced on a computer by almost anyone and bear  a
         clearly scanned image, even if it is of the appellant. There  is  a
         red ink stamp on it but nothing else to authenticate it.  There  is
         no expert evidence to confirm its conformity with  official  wanted
         posters. The appellant claimed his father  got  this  from  a  post
         stand or noticeboard  in  his  village.  However  the  document  is
         pristine and  clearly  has  not  been  stapled  or  pinned  to  any
         noticeboard. It is dated 16.11.13 and  given  that  he  remains  in
         contact with his father in China I fail  to  see  why  it  was  not
         available to the appellant before the previous appeal  hearing.  He
         claimed he received it about a week after the hearing,  which  took
         place on the 6.3.17. However, that is not consistent with the  date
         stamps on the document. Neither is it clear why it  was  issued  on
         16.11.13. It makes no mention of the appellant having escaped  from
         the labour re-education camp or having failed to return on bail. In
         all the circumstances, whilst I take it into account in the context
         of the evidence as a whole, I find I can place little  reliance  on
         this document in support of the appellant's claim to be  wanted  by
         the Chinese authorities"

12. Here the issue for Judge Keane arose in the  first  sentence.  A  judge
    determining this matter afresh with no prior knowledge  of  the  appeal
    would not have been aware that the Appellant had previously applied for
    the hearing to be adjourned so that he could  obtain  the  original  of
    this poster. That is true. I struggle to see, however, what  unfairness
    thereby arises. The opening sentence of  this  paragraph  is,  read  in
    context, nothing more than preamble. I have set the passage out in  its
    entirety because it illustrates that Judge  Pickup  gave  several  good
    reasons why he was not minded to place any  weight  on  this  document.
    None of these turned  on  his  knowledge  of  the  earlier  adjournment
    request, apart from the final point made about  why  it  had  not  been
    available sooner. Even this would have been a finding open to any judge
    determining the appeal, given that the envelope was produced  and  part
    of the evidence in this appeal was about  how  and  when  the  document
    arrived in the United Kingdom.


13. Accordingly I am satisfied that no error of law arose in  Judge  Pickup
    determining this matter in his capacity as a Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

14. Given the terms in which Judge  Keane  granted  permission,  one  might
    think that that was the end of that: see my �2 above[2].  Not so,  says
    Ms Patel, who points out that Judge Keane concluded his  decision  with
    this: "the application for permission is granted".  Ms Patel relied  on
    Safi and others (permission to  appeal  decisions)  [2018]  UKUT  00388
    (IAC) to submit that she had permission on all grounds, notwithstanding
    Judge Keane's remarks that these  grounds  were  without  any  arguable
    merit.

15. The guidance in Safi, given by Mr Justice Lane, is as follows:


         (1) It is essential for a  judge  who  is  granting  permission  to
         appeal only on limited grounds to say so, in terms, in the  section
         of the standard  form  document  that  contains  the  decision,  as
         opposed to the reasons for the decision.


         (2) It is likely to be only in very exceptional circumstances  that
         the Upper Tribunal will be persuaded to entertain a submission that
         a decision which, on its face, grants permission to appeal  without
         express limitation is to be construed  as  anything  other  than  a
         grant  of  permission  on  all  of  the  grounds  accompanying  the
         application for permission, regardless of what might be said in the
         reasons for decision section of the document.


16. I did not hear argument on whether the terms of  this  grant  disclosed
    'exceptional  circumstances',  since  I  thought  it  would   be   more
    straightforward to simply to hear Ms Patel's submissions.


17. The first was that there was an error of law in  Judge  Pickup  placing
    reliance on discrepancies arising from the  SEF  interview,  as  in  YL
    (rely on SEF) China [2004] UKIAT 00145 (IAC).  I am not satisfied  that
    any such error here arises.

18. At paragraph 41 of the determination the Tribunal  weighs  against  the
    Appellant, as it was bound to do  by  s8  of  the  Asylum,  Immigration
    (Treatment of Claimants etc) Act 2004,  the  fact  that  the  Appellant
    delayed for some 18 months before he sought  international  protection.
    Judge Pickup considered  whether  a  reasonable  explanation  had  been
    offered for the delay and found that it hadn't, inter alia noting  that
    there was  a  discrepancy  between  the  evidence  given  at  screening
    interview and the  evidence  that  was  given  later  about  a  claimed
    Snakehead debt. In identifying that discrepancy Judge  Pickup  squarely
    acknowledges the ratio of YL: "even though the screening  interview  is
    not intended to be a comprehensive account he can  be  expected  to  be
    truthful and consistent in his claims". I am satisfied that this was an
    approach open  to  the  Judge.  The  point  in  YL  is  that  screening
    interviews are brief, and so matters there omitted,  but  later  relied
    upon, should not be fatal to the claim's  credibility.   That  was  not
    what happened here. Rather evidence about the debt was  given  at  both
    interviews, but in markedly different terms.


19.  Similarly  the  discrepancy  identified  at  paragraph   22   of   the
    determination is one that turns of substance, rather than an  omission,
    or the Appellant having been brief in  his  answers  at  the  screening
    interview.

20. Ms Patel's second point was that the Tribunal erred in  law  in  taking
    against the Appellant matters that were not put  to  him,  contrary  to
    basic principles of fairness. It is submitted that the  Tribunal  acted
    unfairly in  rejecting  the  Appellant's  account  of  how  his  father
    assisted him with being released from detention.

21. It is a basic tenet of a  fair  trial  that  appellants  are  given  an
    opportunity to meet a forensic challenge. See for instance HA &  Anr  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2010] ScotCS CSIH 28:


         "the Tribunal may identify an issue which has not been raised by
         the parties to the proceedings, but it will be unfair, ordinarily
         at least, for it to base its decision upon its view of that issue
         without giving the parties an opportunity to address it upon the
         matter"

    I am however quite satisfied that  no  such  error  or  unfairness  has
    arisen here. That is because the claim that the Appellant was detained,
    and subsequently released from detention, has been challenged since  at
    least the date of  the  refusal  letter,  the  20th  January  2017.  At
    paragraph 19 of that letter the Respondent rejects it in  these  terms:
    "when asked how you can to be released  (sic)  you  claimed  that  your
    father paid  a  bribe,  that  you  were  released  to  receive  medical
    treatment and that you were released on bail. You have  provided  three
    different accounts of your release from detention and it  is  therefore
    not accepted that you were ever arrested and detained".  Furthermore it
    is apparent from the typed record of proceedings that  Ms  Groves,  who
    also appeared before the First-tier Tribunal, had  cross  examined  the
    Appellant about the circumstances surrounding his  release.  It  was  a
    matter for Ms Patel whether she wished to clarify any  of  the  answers
    given on the point in re-examination; this she  chose  not  to  do.  In
    those circumstances the Tribunal was perfectly entitled to draw adverse
    inference from inconsistencies in the evidence.


22. Ground three is that the First-tier Tribunal  failed  to  give  reasons
    when it stated, at paragraph 22, that  the  Appellant  was  "vague  and
    inconsistent as to what was wrong with him". The grounds  suggest  that
    the Tribunal should have explained in what way the Appellant was  vague
    and inconsistent.   I do  not  believe  that  the  Tribunal  need  give
    reasons for reasons, but if the Appellant is unable to  understand  the
    reasoning in paragraph 22, I shall explain. When first interviewed  the
    Appellant said that he had been badly beaten  in  prison  and  that  he
    became sick. In his substantive interview he said that  he  had  fever,
    flu and bronchitis.  At  the  hearing  he  said  that  he  had  a  high
    temperature  and  hepatitis.     The   Tribunal   found   these   three
    explanations  inconsistent  with  each  other,  which  apart  from  the
    'temperature/fever', they are.  The Tribunal found the evidence  to  be
    vague, because it changed on each occasion that the account was  given.
    Those findings amounted to reasons why the account was disbelieved, and
    they were findings open to the Tribunal on the evidence before it.


23. Ground four is that the First-tier Tribunal failed to  have  regard  to
    material evidence when it found, at paragraph 24 that the Appellant was
    only able to demonstrate a "limited degree  of  knowledge"  about  CAG.
    The material evidence is identified as the Appellant's answers  in  his
    asylum interview at Q73-76, 81-83 and 91.  It is  worth  setting  those
    answers out.

24. At Q73 the Appellant was asked what it was about the female Christ that
    he likes. He replied: "she's Chinese but  she  is  the  female  Christ"
    before going on to explain that God "somehow gone into  her  body".  He
    said that she had been sent to judge people who would be  sentenced  by
    God.   He is later asked what is was about the religion  that  appealed
    to him, to which he said "lots of good  points.  We  believed  in  this
    female Christ will get forever life".

25. I am  satisfied  that  there  was  no  irrationality  in  Judge  Pickup
    concluding  from  those  answers  that  the  Appellant  had  a  limited
    knowledge of CAG. Nor is there any indication that he  failed  to  have
    regard to that interview record: that it formed part  of  the  evidence
    before him is expressly acknowledged at paragraph 15.  As  to  why  the
    Appellant was attracted to CAG in the first place Ms Patel  pointed  to
    the Appellant's explanation that he went to a meeting because he  liked
    a girl who went there.   I am not persuaded that this evidence could or
    should have satisfied Judge Pickup  that  this  was  a  genuinely  held
    faith.

26. Ground five is that the Tribunal failed  to  conduct  a  Tanveer  Ahmed
    assessment when it stated, at paragraph 34, that  the  Appellant's  CAG
    membership card was so poorly made that he could not be satisfied  that
    it was even genuine. I have looked at that card. I entirely agree  with
    Judge Pickup's assessment.  It's a piece of photocopied black and white
    paper that has been cut to card size and laminated.  I  further  reject
    the  contention  that  he  compartmentalised  his  findings.   As   his
    conclusion to paragraph 34 makes clear, it added nothing to the  claim.
    At paragraph 20 the Tribunal  specifically  acknowledges  its  duty  to
    consider all of the evidence in the round.

27. Ground six concerns the 'wanted poster' submitted in  evidence  by  the
    Appellant. As I set out above (at my �11, citing Judge  Pickup's  �39),
    several reasons are given for rejecting the veracity of that  document.
    Some of these, Ms Patel argued, were based on mistakes of  fact.  Judge
    Pickup states that he is  "not satisfied that the translation has  been
    by a certified translator", when in fact it was.  He said that it makes
    "no mention of  the  appellant  having  escaped  from  the  labour  re-
    education camp or having failed to return on  bail"  when  in  fact  it
    does.  I accept that the Tribunal does appear to have  erred  in  those
    two respects. I am however far  from  satisfied  that  this  makes  any
    difference at all to the overall assessment.   Judge  Pickup  does  not
    have to be a document expert to be able to observe that  "the  document
    is something that could have been produced  on  a  computer  by  almost
    anyone" or that it bore no marks  or  pin  holes  even  though  it  was
    supposed to have been retrieved by  the  Appellant's  father  from  the
    village notice board.   The Tribunal was entitled to  note  that  there
    was no verification report with this item of evidence, and that it fell
    to be assessed in the round, taking into account the fact that  it  was
    not provided to the Appellant  until  some  four  years  after  it  was
    allegedly made and put up by the Chinese authorities.

28. All of these grounds, which took up  a  considerable  amount  of  court
    time, were  without  merit.  They  amounted,  as  Judge  Keane  rightly
    identified, to an attempt to re-argue the claim.

29. There was one ground, however, which upon  anxious  scrutiny  had  more
    arguable merit. That was this. The Appellant had appeared, in name  and
    photograph, on the CAG United Kingdom website.  Photographs of  him  on
    CAG protests in London were also featured on  this  website.  Ms  Patel
    submits that the Tribunal failed  to  assess  whether  those  facts  in
    themselves would place the Appellant at risk. It mattered not, for  the
    purpose of this submission, whether  the  Appellant  believed  in  this
    faith, nor indeed whether he was actually the author  of  the  articles
    attributed to him on the website.

30. I accept that the Tribunal  has  not  dealt  with  this  issue  in  the
    determination.   I am not satisfied,  however,  that  on  the  evidence
    before it, this error was in any way material.

31. Asked to identify country background material that  would  support  her
    submission that the images and text on  the  website  would  place  the
    Appellant at a real risk of harm Ms Patel pointed to  the  material  at
    pages 52-75 of the Appellant's bundle. I have read that  evidence.   It
    demonstrates unequivocally that where the Chinese authorities  identify
    someone in China as being an active adherent of  CAG,  that  individual
    faces a real risk of serious harm, usually imprisonment for reasons  of
    his religious belief.  Those  arrested  are  forced  to  work  in  're-
    education camps' until they renounce  their  faith.   Torture  is  used
    systematically against those who refuse to do so.  Since the  crackdown
    started in the 1990s it is estimated  that  300,000  people  have  been
    detained in China as a result of CAG membership. All of  that  evidence
    is accepted  by  the  Respondent.  None  of  it  establishes  that  the
    Appellant, a non-genuine adherent, is at risk by virtue of  having  his
    photograph appear on the United Kingdom based website in question.

32. I note that at 9.1 of the October 2018 report  by  the  United  Nations
    Human Rights review it states:

         "Members of the CAG throughout China continue to  be  subjected  to
         systematic surveillance of their movements, arbitrary  searches  of
         their homes, and monitoring of private communications.  Local  '610
         offices', whose mandate is it to repress xie jiao, routinely  order
         24-hour surveillance of devotees' homes, try to maintain  databases
         of members of the CAG, and make harassing visits  to  practitioners
         released from custody..."

33. Further the European Federation for Freedom of Belief  state  that  the
    Chinese government have employed media attacks against  CAG  in  Korea,
    Taiwan and Hong Kong. Other sources confirm this tactic, to the  effect
    that the Chinese state uses fake news to discredit the group, including
    accusations that it is involved with murder and child abuse.


34. This evidence indicates that inside China the state  uses  surveillance
    against its citizens, and that outside China it uses fake media stories
    to discredit CAG. I could find nothing in  the  material  before  Judge
    Pickup capable of even suggesting that the Chinese state  would  be  a)
    monitoring  websites  abroad  b)   using   intelligence   to   identify
    individuals seen on such websites or  c)  using  such  intelligence  to
    persecute them upon return to China.  Ms Patel asked me to  infer  from
    the generality of evidence on human rights abuses in  China  that  they
    would do all three. She placed reliance upon YB (Eritrea)  v  Secretary
    of State for the Home Department [2008] EWCA  Civ  360  in  which  Lord
    Justice Sedley held:

         "Where, as here, the tribunal has objective evidence which  "paints
         a bleak picture of the suppression of  political  opponents"  by  a
         named government, it requires little or no evidence or  speculation
         to arrive at a strong possibility - and perhaps  more  -  that  its
         foreign legations not only film or photograph their  nationals  who
         demonstrate in public against the regime but have  informers  among
         expatriate oppositionist organisations who can name the people  who
         are  filmed  or  photographed.  Similarly  it  does   not   require
         affirmative  evidence  to  establish   a   probability   that   the
         intelligence services of  such  states  monitor  the  internet  for
         information about oppositionist groups. The real question  in  most
         cases will be what follows for the  individual  claimant.  If,  for
         example, any information reaching the embassy is likely to be  that
         the claimant identified in a photograph is a hanger-on with no real
         commitment to the oppositionist cause, that will go directly to the
         issue flagged up by art 4(3)(d) of the Directive".

35. I confess I have some difficulty in transposing the findings on Eritrea
    made in 2008 to the absence of evidence on Chinese  state  surveillance
    in 2019.   The media is full of stories about  Chinese  espionage  (see
    for instance the recent Huawei controversy).  Human rights  groups  are
    plainly alive to the very real persecution  of  CAG  adherents  in  the
    country itself.  The reports before me do  indicate  that  the  Chinese
    state is actively working against CAG abroad, but only  to  the  extent
    that it plants fake news stories about its  followers  in  the  foreign
    press. Given those three things one would imagine that if there was any
    evidence  that  the  Chinese  state  monitors  CAG  abroad,  and   that
    consequences follow, that this fact would have emerged in the very many
    human rights reports written  about  China.  The  Chinese  diaspora  is
    estimated to consist of over 50 million people. I cannot simply  assume
    that the Chinese state has the means or  inclination  to  monitor  them
    all.    If there is evidence of such surveillance, it  was  not  before
    Judge Pickup.


36. If I am wrong, I focus on Lord Justice Sedley's final  comment  in  YB.
    The real question is whether the Chinese authorities would persecute  a
    man who has falsely claimed to be a member of CAG in order to  found  a
    bogus asylum claim, that being the finding of Judge Pickup.  There  was
    nothing in the evidence before the First-tier Tribunal to indicate that
    to be the case. The surveillance mentioned in the human rights  reports
    is, apparently, targeted against practising adherents  who  first  draw
    themselves to the  authorities'  attention  by  attending  church  etc.
    There being no danger of that here, I am unable to find Judge  Pickup's
    omission to be material. It follows that the appeal is  also  dismissed
    on this ground.  The Appellant has not demonstrated, even to the  lower
    standard of proof that he faces persecution for minimal involvement  in
    this  movement,  involvement  that  has  been  found   to   be   wholly
    opportunistic and cynical.






    Decisions


37. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains no error  of  law
    and the decision is upheld.


38. The appeal is dismissed.

39. This appeal concerned a  protection  claim.  I  therefore  consider  it
    appropriate to make an order for anonymity in the following terms:

        "Unless and until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his
        family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
        Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
        direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"

Tribunal in Durueke (PTA: AZ applied, proper approach) [2019] UKUT 00197
(IAC) was not available to the parties at the date of the hearing and so no
submissions were heard on it.
