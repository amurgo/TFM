                ERROR OF LAW FINDING AND NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL

     1. This is  an  appeal  by  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  against  a
        determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge Ford promulgated  on  18
        March 2014, following a hearing at Birmingham, in which  the  Judge
        allowed the appeal on Article 8 human rights grounds only.


     2. Mrs Kousar is a national of Pakistan born  on  29  June  1989.  She
        applied for spousal entry clearance on 6  October  2012  which  was
        refused on 26 November  2012  because  it  was  said  she  had  not
        submitted all the required documents to demonstrator her  sponsor's
        income was as claimed. The application was refused under  paragraph
        EC-P.1.1 (d) of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.


     3. The Judge  considered  the  evidence  made  available  to  her.  In
        paragraph 11 she finds that she was not satisfied that prior  to  1
        August 2012 the sponsor was either in salaried employment or  self-
        employment for the purposes of the Immigration Rules. As  a  result
        it was not possible for Mrs Kousar to show  that  the  sponsor  was
        earning a gross annual income in excess of the  required  level  of
        �18,600. It is said that this was as a result of the way  in  which
        the sponsor's employment was structured by his  employer,  although
        at the date of decision it was found  the  sponsor  was  working  a
        guaranteed 60 hours a week at �8 per hour which equates to a  gross
        annual income of �24,960.


     4. The Judge notes in paragraph 8 that it was conceded before her that
        Mrs Kousar could only proceed on the basis of her Article  8  human
        rights indicating it was accepted  that  she  could  not  meet  the
        requirements of the Rules relating to  demonstrating  the  required
        level of minimum income being available by the method specified  in
        the Rules.


     5. In relation to Article 8 the  Judge  considered  that  family  life
        existed between Mrs Kousar and her sponsor.  The  Judge  states  in
        paragraph 12 that although it will be possible for  Mrs  Kousar  to
        apply again for spousal entry clearance it would, in her  view,  be
        wholly unreasonable and unduly harsh to expect her to  do  so.  The
        Judge refers  to  the  will  of  Parliament  being  to  ensure  the
        protection of the public purse that she finds cannot be relied upon
        to justify the decision on  the  basis  Mrs  Kousar's  sponsor  was
        clearly earning more than the barrier set by Parliament of  �18,600
        at the date the decision. The Judge states that the refusal was not
        justified on the facts of the case on any public interest  and  was
        unduly harsh. It is also suggested the decision did not involve the
        balancing the competing public interests. The sponsor  was  working
        for the same employer and there was no risk to the public purse  in
        granted entry clearance or that the parties would be forced to live
        below the minimum level set  by  Parliament.  The  Judge  therefore
        found the decision to be disproportionate.


     6. The challenge by the Entry Clearance Officer is made on  the  basis
        the Judge made a material misdirection of law.  It is accepted  Mrs
        Kousar could not satisfy the requirements of the Immigration  Rules
        and Article 8 is not intended to allow an individual to bypass  the
        Rules. Exceptional circumstances had not been  established.  It  is
        submitted the Judge erred in relation to the assessment of the date
        when she was required to consider the sponsor's income too.



Discussion



     7.  There  was  no  attendance  on   behalf   of   Mrs   Kousar   for,
        notwithstanding  the  Judges  personal   feelings   regarding   the
        reasonableness of making a further application, the Upper  Tribunal
        received a letter from Khirri Solicitors  dated  15  December  2014
        stating:


              " The up-to-date position is that Mrs  Kousar  has  re-applied
   for a partner (spouse)           entry  clearance  under  paragraph  E.C-
   P.1.1 of Appendix FM therefore our                  instructions  are  to
   withdraw this appeal case from the Upper Tribunal Court list"


     8. Although Mrs Kousar no longer wishes  to  pursue  this  appeal  the
        application before the Upper Tribunal was in  fact  an  application
        made  by  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer.  There  is  therefore  an
        application the  Tribunal  needs  to  deal  with  although  if  the
        determination is set aside Mrs Kousar's request to withdraw can  be
        considered at that stage.


     9. It  is  not  disputed  that  Mrs  Kousar  is  unable  to  meet  the
        requirements of the Immigration Rules. Not only do  the  Rules  set
        out the minimal level  of  income  an  individual  is  required  to
        demonstrate to prevent reliance upon public funds, it also sets out
        the method by which the  availability  of  such  income  is  to  be
        established.


    10. Article 8 does not permit an individual to choose where  they  wish
        to live although it is accepted that it  does  contain  a  positive
        obligation upon states not to interfere with established family and
        private life recognised and protected by  Article  8  without  good
        reason.  Even though Article 8 also contains a positive  obligation
        to promote and  permit  family  life  to  develop,  the  test  when
        assessing proportionality remains the same. Article 8 also  affords
        a margin of appreciation upon the Higher Contracting  States  under
        which the Secretary of State has set out both in  relation  to  the
        Rules and more recently in  statutory  provisions  how  the  United
        Kingdom Parliament  believe  such  competing  interests  should  be
        assessed.


    11. The Grounds refer to the requirement for there  to  be  exceptional
        circumstances as per Gulshan [2013] UKUT 00640 before an appeal can
        be  allowed  under  Article  8  outside  the   Rules.    The   term
        'exceptional' has been held to mean circumstances in which  refusal
        would result in unjustifiably harsh consequences for the individual
        such that refusal of the application would not be proportionate. In
        determining whether  there  are  exceptional  circumstances,    the
        Judge was required to consider all relevant factors.


    12. The Judge was required to consider the Article 8 assessment at  the
        date of decision not the date of application which is the  relevant
        period under the Rules.  The finding  by  the  Judge  that  it  was
        wholly unreasonable and unduly harsh to expect Mrs Kousar to make a
        fresh application is not  adequately  reasoned  in  relation  to  a
        person who cannot satisfy the requirements of the Rules.  The Judge
        refers to evidence which she finds satisfied  a  certain  level  of
        income but also notes specific evidence could not  be  provided  as
        required by Appendix FM-SE. As this appears to be the  key  finding
        and the basis on which the Article 8  appeal  is  allowed  and  the
        decision found to be  unduly  harsh,  this  element  has  not  been
        adequately reasoned and nor has there been an adequate analysis  of
        the weight to be given to the fact Mrs Kousar is unable to  satisfy
        the requirements of the Rules, both in relation to establishing the
        requirements of  the  relevant  income  level  and  being  able  to
        corroborate such a claim by the  specified  documents.   The  Judge
        refers to the purpose behind the Rules  being  to  prevent  persons
        from coming to the  United  Kingdom  without  seeking  recourse  to
        public funds yet the purpose is also to  ensure  that  any  claimed
        income is  proved  to  be  genuine  and  sustainable  by  specified
        methods.


    13. There have been a number of authorities relevant to  the  issue  of
        Article 8 and the 'new' Immigration Rules which must not be read as
        seeking to qualify or fetter the assessment of Article  8.  It  is,
        however, necessary to consider such domestic as well as  Strasbourg
        jurisprudence when assessing an Article 8  claim,  including  cases
        such as Gulshan and MM (Lebanon). There is also a need to  look  at
        the evidence to see if there was anything  which  has  not  already
        been adequately considered in the context of the Immigration  Rules
        and  which  could  lead  to  a  successful  Article  8  claim.  The
        determinative factor in the Judges decision is the fact Mrs  Kousar
        was found to have demonstrated that it is unlikely she  will  be  a
        burden on the public purse but in ZY (Turkey) v Secretary of  State
        for the Home Department [2011] EWCA Civ 65 the Court of Appeal said
        that, amongst other things, the fact that the Claimant  was  not  a
        burden on the state was not capable of  carrying  any  weight;  not
        needing to have  recourse  to  public  funds  was  a  pre-condition
        imposed by the Immigration Rules but  it  was  not  sufficient  for
        entry, and it was impossible to understand how  it  could  outweigh
        the need for effective immigration control.


    14. The determination is set aside.


    15. In light of Mrs Kousar's request to withdrawal her challenge to the
        original decision on the basis of her making a  fresh  application,
        for which permission is granted, there  is  no  longer  any  appeal
        extant before the Upper Tribunal upon which a decision can be made.


Decision

    16. The First-tier Tribunal Judge materially erred in law. I set  aside
        the decision of the original Judge.  Following  the  withdrawal  of
        the appeal by Mrs Kousar there is no longer an  extant  application
        before the Upper Tribunal.


   Anonymity.


    17. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005.  I make no such order pursuant to rule  14  of  the  Tribunal
        Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
