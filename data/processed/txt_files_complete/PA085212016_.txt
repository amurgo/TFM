                                                                  Respondent




Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms C Robinson of Counsel instructed by Lupins
(Olympic Way)
For the Respondent:    Mr L Tarlow, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer



                            DECISION AND REASONS



1.    The  Secretary  of  State  appeals,   with   permission,   against   a
    determination of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Adio  promulgated  on
    13 April 2017 in which he allowed the appeal of Mr Ali Ahmad against  a
    decision of the Secretary of State to refuse him  leave  to  remain  on
    human rights grounds.

2.   Although the Secretary of State is the appellant before me I will,  for
    ease of reference, refer to her  as  the  respondent  as  she  was  the
    respondent in the First-tier.  Similarly, I will refer to Mr Ali  Ahmad
    as the appellant as he was the appellant in the First-tier.

3.   The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan, aged 26.   He  entered  Britain
    in 2008 on a "multi-child unaccompanied visa" which had been granted on
    29 August 2006.  He was encountered by  police  during  a  visit  to  a
    residential address in January 2010 and arrested and served with  FORMS
    IS151A and IS96 as an overstayer subject to administrative removal.  He
    failed to report and was again encountered working in  April  2016  and
    again served with documentation  informing  him  of  his  liability  to
    removal as an overstayer and detained.  He claimed to be married  to  a
    British citizen and in April 2016 made a human rights claim.  In May of
    that year he claimed asylum.  His human rights claim  was  refused  and
    certified on 9 May 2016 but those removal directions were cancelled due
    to the asylum claim and his case was accepted for  consideration.   His
    application for asylum was refused on 4 July 2016.  He appealed on both
    asylum and human rights grounds.

4.   His appeal was heard by Judge  Adio  who  set  out  the  basis  of  the
    appellant's asylum claim in paragraphs 4 onwards of  the  determination
    and also set out evidence from the appellant  and  his  wife  regarding
    their relationship.  In brief his wife stated that they had started the
    relationship in 2012 and the appellant had proposed to her on 19  March
    2014.  She said that they  had  a  genuine  relationship  and  she  had
    converted to Islam.  He had told her about his status  early  in  2013.
    She stated that she had family in Britain and that she was working in a
    nursery although she was qualified as a primary  school  teacher.   Her
    evidence is that she was earning ï¿½17,400 per annum.  She talked of  the
    difficulties she would face if she were forced  to  live  in  Pakistan.
    Various friends and relatives of the appellant and his  wife  spoke  of
    the genuineness of the relationship.

5.   Having set out details of the submissions the judge  in  paragraphs  24
    onwards set  out  his  findings  of  fact.   He  first  considered  the
    appellant's claim to asylum.  He stated that  despite  negative  points
    which went against the appellant's credibility there were a  number  of
    points which were in his favour.  Indeed his claim  that  he  had  been
    targeted by the Sunni Tehreek Movement in his area at one stage appears
    to have been accepted in that the judge accepted that he  had  a  graze
    from a bullet in his arm and he accepted also that his  wife  had  said
    that he had told her of his problems.

6.   However, the judge did find many elements of the appellant's claim  for
    asylum to be lacking in credibility and found that for him there  would
    be a sufficiency of protection in Pakistan and indeed that he would  be
    able to internally relocate away from his home area.

7.   In paragraphs 33 onwards  he  dealt  with  the  appellant's  Article  8
    claim.  He accepted that this was a genuine marriage: he and had  noted
    that the sponsor was a British citizen.  He then went  on  to  consider
    whether or not paragraphs EX.1 and  EX.2  of  the  Rules  applied.   He
    clearly stated that he had  to  consider  whether  or  not  there  were
    insurmountable  obstacles  to  continuing  family  life  overseas.   In
    paragraphs 35 and 36 he stated:-

         "35. EX.2 defines the insurmountable obstacles as very  significant
             difficulties which would be faced by the  applicant  or  their
             partner in continuing their family life together  outside  the
             UK and which could  not  be  overcome  or  would  entail  very
             serious hardship for the applicant or their  partner.   Having
             considered all the evidence before me I find  that  there  are
             insurmountable obstacles to the family  life  continuing  with
             the partner outside the UK in view of the following.

         36.  The appellant's partner is employed in  the  UK  as  a  deputy
             manager of Tiny Tots Nursery.  Bearing in mind she is a  white
             British Muslim woman who has never been to Pakistan before and
             does not speak Urdu and has all her family and friends in  the
             UK she will find  it  extremely  difficult  to  fit  into  the
             culture and the way of life in Pakistan.  She has never  lived
             there and would not have the family support  that  could  make
             day to day living with her husband  practicable.   The  couple
             have been trying for children for the  past  one  and  a  half
             years and the appellant's  partner  has  been  diagnosed  with
             polycystic ovarian syndrome and this is having  an  impact  on
             their ability to have children.   As  a  British  citizen  she
             would not be able to have her entitlement  to  seek  the  best
             health facilities she can to improve her chance  of  having  a
             baby with her husband.  I therefore find for these reasons the
             appellant satisfies  the  requirements  of  Article  8  within
             Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules."

    Although he had dismissed the appeal on  asylum  grounds  he  therefore
    allowed the appeal on human rights grounds.

8.   Both the appellant and the Secretary  of  State  appealed  against  the
    decisions of the Immigration Judge.  Permission was not granted on  the
    appellant's application against the dismissal of the asylum  claim  but
    permission was granted to the respondent to challenge the  decision  to
    allow the appellant's human rights appeal.

9.   Mr Tarlow relied on the grounds  of  appeal.   He  submitted  that  the
    difficulties which might be faced by  the  appellant's  wife  were  not
    insurmountable difficulties when considered against the guidance in the
    judgement of the Court of Appeal in Agyarko & Others  [2015]  EWCA  Civ
    440.  He relied on the letter of refusal in which it  was  argued  that
    the appellant's wife would have some support in Pakistan and that being
    a white female and British would not cause serious  hardship.   It  had
    been stated that it was a sheer conjecture on behalf of  the  judge  to
    consider that the appellant's wife could not adapt to life in  Pakistan
    as the appellant had the ability and tenacity to adapt  into  an  alien
    culture in Britain and indeed had worked here without  family  support.
    It was argued that the couple would be able to relocate to a large city
    in Pakistan.

10.  Ms Robinson argued that the judge had properly set  out  in  paragraphs
    35 and 36 the relevant test and gave reasons for allowing  the  appeal.
    He had referred to what he considered were insurmountable obstacles  to
    the appellant's wife relocating to Pakistan as a  white  British  woman
    who did not speak Urdu.  Moreover of course she  did  not  have  family
    support there and the appellant would have difficulty in  returning  to
    his  home  area.   She  referred  to  the  appellant's  wife's  witness
    statement which set out in detail her belief that she would not be able
    to integrate into life  in  Pakistan  and  indeed  her  fear  of  being
    expected to do so.  Evidence regarding her work was put forward and  it
    was argued that the judge's findings were fully  open  to  him  on  the
    evidence.

Discussion

11.  The reality is that  the  reasons  for  refusal  letter  refer  to  the
    appellant's ability to relocate here and  suggest  that  therefore  the
    appellant's wife could adapt  to  living  in  Pakistan.    That  is,  I
    consider, a non sequitur.  It is much more difficult for her to pick up
    Urdu or to find work and as a white woman she  would  be  in  an  alien
    culture.  Moreover, the other factors mentioned by the judge, including
    her entitlement to  receive  fertility  treatment  here  as  a  British
    citizen, are relevant.   It was also pointed out to me that  there  was
    evidence that the appellant's wife's mother was suffering  from  cancer
    and required her assistance here although that was not a matter  before
    the judge.  I note the Foreign Office guidance  which  was  before  the
    judge.

12.  The reality is that the judge did properly direct  himself  as  to  the
    relevant test, set out relevant factors and reached a conclusion  which
    was open to him on the evidence.  I bear in mind the  judgment  of  the
    Court of Appeal in Mukarkar [2006] EWCA Civ 1045 when it is stated that
    if one judge when considering the Article 8 rights of an  appellant  is
    more generous than another might be that is not an error  of  law.   In
    this case  I  consider,  notwithstanding  the  appellant's  immigration
    history and the provisions of section 117B,  that the judge  reached  a
    conclusion which was not only open to  him  but  in  no  way  could  be
    characterised as perverse.   I  would  add  that  having  observed  the
    appellant's  wife  I  would,  should  she  have  given  evidence   have
    considered that she would appear to be a vulnerable  person  who  would
    have  find it impossible to live  Pakistan.  In all I consider that the
    decision of the judge to allow this appeal on human rights grounds  was
    a decision which was open to him and I therefore dismiss the appeal  of
    the Secretary of State.  The decision of the judge to allow the  appeal
    on human rights grounds shall stand.







Notice of Decision

13.  The appeal of the Secretary of State is  dismissed.   The  decision  of
    the judge in the first-tier  to  allow  this  appeal  on  human  rights
    grounds shall stand.
