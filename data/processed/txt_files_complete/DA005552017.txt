Representation:

For the appellant:           Mr. A Govan, Senior Presenting Officer
For the respondent:        Mr A Caskie, Counsel, instructed by Rea Law

Introduction

1. Although proceedings in the Upper Tribunal have been initiated by the
   Secretary of State, for convenience I will refer to the parties
   hereinafter as in the First-tier Tribunal.


2. The appellant in the First-tier Tribunal successfully appealed the
   respondent's decision of 27 July 2017 to make a Deportation Order. That
   decision was set aside by the Upper Tribunal following a hearing on 14
   December 2018. The First-tier Tribunal had proceeded on the basis he was
   entitled to the 2nd of the 3 levels of protection afforded by European
   law. In the Upper Tribunal his representative accepted that the First-
   tier Tribunal judge erred in concluding the appellant had demonstrated a
   right of permanent residence, giving rise to the 2nd level of protection.
   It is now been accepted that he is entitled to the lowest level of
   protection and the appeal is being reheard on this basis.

3. The appellant is a national of Poland born on 30 November 1979. The
   deportation proceedings came about because of his criminality, both in
   Poland and in the United Kingdom. The appellant's representative accepts
   that the records of his convictions produced is accurate.

Criminal convictions

4. His convictions are as follows:

   The Polish convictions from the date of conviction.

     i) 22nd of April 1998-grevious bodily harm; theft; and handling. He
        was originally sentenced to 10 months imprisonment on the 1st 2
        counts and one year's imprisonment on the 3rd, suspended for 3
        years. These were subsequently varied to one-year suspended on each
        count. He was also fined and the compensation order made.
    ii) 23rd of August 2004-taking a motor vehicle without consent.
        Sentenced to one year and 3 months imprisonment and disqualified
        for 2 years.
   iii) 11 March 2005- driving whilst unfit due to drink/drugs. Sentenced
        to 6 months unpaid work, disqualified for 2 years and fined.
    iv) 25 September 2005- robbery; blackmail; threatening abusive and
        disorderly behaviour. Sentenced to 3 months imprisonment
     v) 19 March 2012- attempted robbery; robbery; possession of a firearm.
        He was sentenced to 3 months imprisonment and fined.
    vi) 20 June 2013- damage to property: sentenced to 5 months
        imprisonment.


   The UK convictions from the date of conviction.


     i) 22 January 2016- breach of the peace. Fined.
    ii) 16 November 2016- threatening/abusive behaviour. Domestic abuse-
        sentence deferred.
   iii) 5th January 2017- driving over the limit. Fined and disqualified
        for 22 months.
    iv) 16th January 2017- producing a controlled drug. Fined.
     v) I8 February 2017-road traffic offences. Fined.


   In summary, he had been convicted of 15 offences in Poland and 7 offences
   in the United Kingdom.

The decision


5. The deportation decision was taken under the Immigration (
   EEA)Regulations 2016. The respondent referred to regulation 23(6)(b) and
   public policy. Reference was also made to regulation 27(5), whereby the
   decision must comply with the following principles:


     i) Proportionality.
   (ii)      Based exclusively on personal conduct.
   (iii)     The person must present a genuine, present and serious threat
   to the fundamental interests of society.
   (iv)     Matters isolated from the particulars of the case or generalised
   prevention does not justify the decision.
    vi) Convictions in themselves do not justify the decision
   vii) A decision can be based upon preventative grounds.

6. The respondent also referred to schedule 1 of the 2016 Regulations which
   provides guidance on the interests of society. The number of offences was
   highlighted as indicating a propensity to commit crime. Therefore,
   deportation was justified in the interests of public order. It was felt
   the appellant had shown no regard for the judicial systems involved and
   these had not deterred his reoffending. He was a persistent offender and
   it was felt likely he will continue to reoffend. The decision was
   necessary to protect the public.


7. The respondent in considering the proportionality referred to the
   appellant's age, 37. His health was good. At that stage the appellant
   indicated he had a partner who was expecting his child. Limited
   information was provided. There was also reference to the limited
   evidence of his economic activity. His length of residence was
   considered, with the respondent noted there was a record of him having
   arrived in February 2012. Regarding his integration, there was only
   limited evidence. It was felt he retained links with Poland, having spent
   most of his life there.

8. The respondent had regard to rehabilitation and what was said in Essa
   [2012] EWCA Civ 1718. The conclusion was that there was no ongoing
   rehabilitation programme here and any rehabilitation could continue in
   Poland.

9. The respondent also had regard to the appellant's article 8 rights and
   referred to paragraphs A 362 and A 398-399D. Reference was made to
   section 117 (C) and (D). Whilst these provisions are not applying
   directly to the appellant, article 8 did and in the interests of equal
   treatment they were considered. In terms of the statutory provision his
   deportation was conducive to the public good as he had been sentenced to
   imprisonment between 12 months and 4 years. Such a sentence would require
   his deportation unless the exceptions applied or there were very
   compelling circumstances. Reference was then made to paragraph 399 and
   399A, as well as section 117C (4) and (5). In terms of his family life
   there was no evidence his wife was a British citizen. At that stage his
   son had not been born.

10. Regard was made to his private life and paragraph 399A. All of the
   requirements had to apply whereas the respondent concluded none applied.
   He had not been here most of his life; there was little evidence of
   integration and the respondent did not see very significant obstacles to
   his reintegration into life in Poland.

11. The respondent did not see any other compelling circumstances.

12. The decision made was originally certified so as to provide for his
   removal. This was not pursued by the respondent.

Consideration

13. In considering the appeal I must have regard to the position as at the
   time of hearing. Since the original decision there is more information
   about his relationship with his partner, Ms M U. The papers provide a
   statement from her and she has attended and given evidence. She also is a
   Polish national, born on 23 September 1987. She said she came to the
   United Kingdom on 5 June 2008. She has been in regular employment. She
   said her parents and brother live in Poland but she is not in close
   contact. She states that in the past 10 years she has been back to Poland
   twice. She gave birth to the appellant's son, F, on 9 September 2017. She
   states that she sees her future as being here and if the appellant were
   removed, she and her son would remain here.


14. The papers on behalf of the appellant show that he had a brother, D,
   who had been living here with his wife, T. They had 8 children whose ages
   range from 18 to 2 years old. His brother died from a myocardial
   infarction on 11 October 2017. It was said that the appellant provides
   financial and practical help to the family are closely attached to him.
   There are various testimonials in the papers in support of the appellant.

15. In the appellant's statement he expresses remorse. He states that he
   was detained on 9 August 2017 and then given bail on 6 December 2017 this
   meant he was in custody when his brother died and when his son was born.
   He acknowledges his criminality but states he came from a poor part of
   Poland and he had been abusing alcohol. He states he has no close family
   there. He said his father committed suicide. He referred to being in a
   previous relationship in Poland in the 1990s which lasted for 6 years. He
   said during that time he controlled his alcohol input and there was no
   offending. He has 4 children in Poland, aged 14, 17, and two at 18. He
   says he has little contact with them.

16. His employment history is poorly documented. The best information
   provided is employment our tax returns. These indicate for the year 2013
   to 14 is profit from self-employment was �4622. In the following year he
   earned �21,807. In the year 2015 to 16 this had reduced to just over
   �10,000 and in 2016 to 2017 was just over �12,000. He is indicated that
   he ran a car repair business but there were little details in the paper.
   Because such activity may have indicated enterprise on his part I was
   agreeable to his representative submitting evidence of this post hearing.
   What I received was disappointingly little and consisted of episodic rent
   payments for work premises he said he rented

17. In his statement he said that when he came to the United Kingdom he was
   intent on putting his past behind him. However, he continued to commit
   offences here. He also confirmed that the offence relating to producing a
   controlled drug consisted of his growing cannabis which he said was for
   his own consumption. Aggravating feature was that this was that the plant
   was cultivated in the family home.

18. In oral evidence the appellant said that his late brother's family
   lived a mile away and he would see them constantly. He said the
   cultivation offence occurred 6 months before his conviction in cross-
   examination he was asked about details of the various offences. He
   accepted that in the past he was addicted to alcohol particularly vodka.
   The he said he has attended AA before and wants to re-attend. He
   maintained he now was abstinent.

19. His partner gave evidence and said there was nothing for the family in
   Poland. He said that he no longer drinks but wants to spend his time with
   the children. She maintained that the birth of their son was brought
   about a change in him.at hearing it was confirmed that his son is a
   British national.

20. In submissions the presenting officer continued to rely upon the
   reasons for refusal letter. He said the appellant had a history of
   serious criminality he said the appellant had acquired skills here which
   would be transferable to Poland. He said it was a matter of choice
   whether his partner and their son joined him in Poland.

21. In response, Mr Caskie stressed the position of the appellant's child
   and said this had brought about a change in the appellant who now
   recognises his responsibilities. He said the change predated the birth
   because of the influence of his partner. He said the appellant clearly
   aware that if he offends again then he will risk all. He submitted it was
   necessary to consider his likely behaviour in the future rather than
   concentrate on the past when assessing the risk. I was referred to the
   evidence which indicates the appellant is currently employed and there is
   a letter dated 4 February 2019 from a garage indicating he has been doing
   subcontracting work.

Conclusions

22. Deportation of EU nationals is covered by Directive 2004/38/EC This was
   implemented by the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006
   and now the 2016 Regulations which came fully into force on 1 February
   2017.


23. For the appeal I have received case law on behalf of the appellant.
   Arranz (EEA regulations - deportation - test) [2017] UKUT 294 the Upper
   Tribunal held that the burden of proof lay on the SSHD to prove that a
   person represents a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat
   affecting one of the fundamental interests of society. This was also
   expressed in the Inner House of the Court of Session in SA v SSHD [2018]
   CSIH 28.

24. I have sought to bear in mind all of the material which has been led
   and to make an overall assessment. I am satisfied the appellant does
   present a threat: principally, this relates to the risk of reoffending.
   His past misconduct has been serious and repeated. It has involved
   violence; dishonesty; drunk offences and driving whilst under the
   influence of drink or drugs. It is impossible to predict if the appellant
   will commit offences again. He claims his earlier crimes were committed
   against the background of poverty. This is no justification at the
   evidence does not indicate these were crimes forced by necessity.

25. He also said that he was under the influence of alcohol. He is
   indicated some periods of abstinence and stability in his life. He
   highlighted the period when he had a partner in Poland for 5 years. He
   states that he is committed to reducing if not abstaining from alcohol.

26. There has been a tapering in the nature and frequency of his
   convictions said she came to the United Kingdom. However, I see the fact
   that he was growing cannabis in the family home by which stage he was in
   the relationship with the present partner as undermining his claim.
   Against this, if he were returned to Poland without support it seems
   likely is motivation to abstain from alcohol and not engage in
   criminality will be reduced and he may spiral downward.


27. I note the most serious offences were committed in Poland when he was
   younger. He is now someone with responsibilities towards his partner and
   child and also to his late brother's family. They have provided evidence
   in support of his appeal to the effect he is caring and helpful towards
   them. As Mr Caskie emphasised at hearing he appreciates the likely
   consequences of any further slipups. Consequently, there is a possibility
   he will rehabilitate himself and this is much less likely to occur in
   Poland.

28. His partner is not dependent upon him for her status. Her evidence is
   that she has been here 10 years during which time she has been employed.
   Although I have not received confirmation, if correct, then she would
   have a permanent right of residence. It was mentioned that his child is
   entitled to British citizenship albeit I have not seen documentation. His
   partner has indicated that if he were removed she would not follow.
   Consequently, this potential stabilising influence on his life will be
   lost. Apart from this, there will be the breakup of the family unit. I am
   required to have regard to article 8 not only in relation to the
   appellant but also in relation to his wife partner and child.

29. A significant event since the decision was the birth of his child. In
   reaching the decision I have to have regard to the section 55 duty in
   relation to the best interests of his child. The child's interests are a
   primary but not the only consideration. His partner has indicated his
   child will be remaining in the United Kingdom irrespective of the
   outcome. No Zambrano argument was advanced and all the evidence indicates
   the child will not have to leave if he is removed. As a generality it
   would be in the child's best interests to grow in a stable family unit
   knowing both parents. Therefore this favours the appellant remaining.

30. I am also conscious that albeit the evidence of employment has been
   limited he has now been here a number of years. There is evidence that
   over this period he did have jobs and has a prospect of future
   employment. There has been limited evidence of integration albeit I
   accept within the local Polish community he has developed friendships.

31. I have sought to balance all these factors. The decision is finely
   balanced but am significantly influenced by the position of his child and
   the potential for a family unit to be maintained. There is a possibility
   the appellant has now made a commitment to reform, particularly as he
   appreciates the consequences for him and his family if he commits further
   crimes. I am influenced by the article 8 factors and the need to consider
   the best interests of his child. I have borne in mind as a comparator the
   public interest factors set out in sections 117 B and C and what was said
   in KO (Nigeria)[2018]UKSC 53. I accept the appellant has a genuine
   parental relationship with his son who should not be penalised because of
   his father's past misdeeds. The position of his partner must also be
   considered and accept family life exists between them and she needs the
   appellant support bring up their child. Looking at all these matters it
   is my conclusion that the appeal against the deportation order succeeds.

Decision

The appeal is allowed.
