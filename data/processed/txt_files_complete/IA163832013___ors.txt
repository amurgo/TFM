Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr R Solomon, of Counsel instructed by Messrs Jein
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellants are citizens of Bangladesh, Mr  Monzour  Ahamed  and  Mr
    Abdullah  Al  Mamun  being  the  principal  appellants  and  the  other
    appellants are their dependants.  The principal appellants had  applied
    for leave to remain as Tier 1 Entrepreneurs.  Their  applications  were
    refused and their appeals, and  therefore  the  appeals  of  the  other
    appellants as their dependants were dismissed by Judge  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal N M K Lawrence  in  a  determination  promulgated  on  31
    December 2013.

2.   Mr Ahamed had entered Britain as a Tier 4 Student on 19 September  2009
    and had then been granted leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Post-Study Work)
    Migrant until 21 September 2012.  Mr Al Mamun had been granted leave to
    enter and remain initially as a student and then had leave as a Tier  1
    (Post-Study Work) Migrant until 21 January 2013.  He then applied  with
    Mr Ahamed as the entrepreneurial team.  They appeared to  rely  on  the
    same evidence.  The refusal of Mr Ahamed is dated 25 April 2013.  Under
    Appendix A "Attributes" he was awarded no points.  The  refusal  stated
    as follows:-

         "You have stated that you have invested, or had  invested  on  your
         behalf, at least �18,191.28 into one  or  more  businesses  in  the
         United Kingdom.  The evidence you have supplied in the  form  of  a
         Barclays and Lloyds TSB Bank statement shows that  your  investment
         combined with current funds available in the UK has a value of less
         than �50,000, which is  unacceptable,  as  stated  in  under  [sic]
         Appendix A of the Immigration Rules.  Your representative's  letter
         has claimed you have invested �18,191.28 into the business, however
         the evidence you have provided to show this claim is  insufficient,
         this is because figures of funds have  only  been  highlighted,  it
         does not state where or what it has been invested in.  In order for
         you to prove investment  you  need  to  provide  evidence  from  an
         accountant  confirming  the  amounts  and  what  the  amounts  were
         invested in.  Please refer to 46-SD the Immigration Rules:


         (a)  The applicant  must  provide  all  the  appropriate  specified
             documents needed to establish  the  amount  of  money  he  has
             invested from the following list:


             (i)  If the applicant's business is a registered company  that
                  is required  to  produce  audited  accounts,  the  audited
                  accounts must be provided;


             (ii) If the applicant's business is not  required  to  produce
                  audited accounts, unaudited accounts and  an  accountant's
                  certificate of confirmation, from an accountant who  is  a
                  member of a UK Recognised Supervisory Body (as defined  in
                  the Companies Act 2006), must be provided;


             (iii)    If the applicant has made the investment in the  form
                  of a director's loan, it must be shown in the relevant set
                  of accounts provided, and the applicant must also  provide
                  a legal agreement between the applicant (in the name  that
                  appears on his application) and the company.
             ....


         (c)  The applicant must provide the following specified document to
             show that he has established a UK business:


             (i)  Evidence that the business has business premises  in  the
                  UK:


                  (1)  If the applicant is self  employed  his  registration
                      with HM Revenue and Customs to show that the business
                      is based in the UK, or


                  (2)  If  the  applicant  is  a  director,  printout  of  a
                      Companies House document showing the address  of  the
                      registered office in the UK or  head  office  in  the
                      United Kingdom if it has no  registered  office,  and
                      the  applicant's  name,  as   it   appears   on   the
                      application form, as a director,


             and


             (ii) Evidence that the business has a UK bank account:


                  (1)  If the applicant is self employed,  a  personal  bank
                      statement showing transactions for his business, or a
                      business bank statement, or a letter from a  UK  bank
                      confirming that he has a business  and  acts  through
                      that bank, or


                  (2)  If the  applicant  is  a  director,  a  company  bank
                      statement showing that the company has a UK  account,
                      or a letter  from  a  UK  bank  confirming  that  the
                      company has a bank account ,
             and


             (iii)    Evidence that the business is subject to UK taxation:


             ...


         (e)  If some of the money has been invested into a business in  the
             UK, the balance of funds must be held in a regulated financial
             institution and disposable in the UK.
         ...


         As you have provided evidence in the form of a  Halifax  statement,
         stating you have �25,024.16 on 16 January 2013.   This  still  does
         not meet the requirement of �50,000.  We have therefore been unable
         to award points for attributes."

3.   Mr Ahamed was awarded no points for funds held in  regulated  financial
    institutions or  those  that  are  disposable  in  the  United  Kingdom
    although he was awarded points for English language and maintenance.

4.   I note that the Tier 1 application form claimed that he had  �11,416.10
    in a Barclays Bank account at G10 although it was stated that he  would
    be investing �15,048 in the  business.   The  amount  invested  in  the
    business was claimed to be �18,191.28.

5.   He also claimed to be a marketing and sales manager and that  that  job
    title appeared on the graduate level occupation list under number 1132.



6.   Mr Al Mamun's application was also refused in identical terms.  He  had
    claimed on the application form that he had had �22,492.79 in a Halifax
    Bank account but that he had  �3,151  invested  in  the  business.   He
    stated that his job title was as an advertising  and  public  relations
    manager (1134).

7.   The grounds of appeal asserted that the Secretary of State should  have
    awarded points for funds in that there had been  adequate  evidence  of
    the sum of �18,191 of money already invested in the business.

8.   Judge Lawrence set out the background to the  appeal  in  paragraphs  2
    onwards of the determination.  He noted the claim that  �18,191.28  had
    been invested in the business and stated that that  sum  added  to  the
    �25,024.16 held in the Halifax account did not amount to  �50,000.   It
    was claimed before him by the appellant's  representatives  that  funds
    were also held in the Sonali Bank or the National  Bank  of  Bangladesh
    but the judge stated that there was no evidence before him  that  those
    banks satisfied the provisions of Appendix P of  the  Rules.   He  said
    that he was not  satisfied  that  Mr  Ahamed  had  submitted  any  bank
    statements from Sonali Bank to the respondent.  In  respect  of  Mr  Al
    Mamun he stated there was a reference to the National Bank but  it  did
    not appear to feature in the respondent's  decision.   He  pointed  out
    that Mr Al Mamun had the burden of proving  that  the  balance  in  the
    National Bank of Bangladesh met the requirements of Appendix P.

9.   It was his conclusion that the appellants had not shown that  they  had
    the relevant sum of �50,000 to be  invested  in  the  enterprise.  With
    regard to the sums amounting to  the �18191.28  claimed  to  have  been
    invested in the business  the judge wrote in paragraph 12 :
           "In the  course  of  examination  Mr  Ahamed  asserted  that  he
           provided invoices with his application.  However, Mr Hurley  put
           A52 of the respondent's bundle to him  and  Mr  Ahamed  accepted
           that it  did  not  record  any  invoices  being  sent  with  the
           application form.  Mr Al Mamun accepted that  the  advertisement
           was sent after the application  form  had  been  submitted.   He
           accepted  that  the  invoices  were  also  not  sent  with   the
           application form."


10.  Lengthy grounds of appeal were submitted.  They asserted  that  �15,040
    had been invested by Mr Ahamed in the business -  they  referred  to  a
    letter from his accountant and it  was  stated  that  the  accountant's
    letter was in the appellant's bundle.  It was also stated that  �11,000
    had been held in Mr Monzour Ahamed's Barclays account which was in  the
    respondent's bundle at page C11 and that therefore the sums of  �15,040
    invested together with �11,000 available in the Barclays' account  gave
    an overall total of �26,000.  It was argued therefore  that  the  total
    amount for the business amounted to �26,000 in respect  of  Mr  Monzour
    Ahamed and �25,000 in respect of Mr Al Mamun giving an overall total of
    �51,000.

11.  It was claimed therefore that the appellants met  the  requirements  of
    the Rules.

12.  Judge Brunnen granted permission to appeal noting that  it  was  argued
    that the judge had failed to consider relevant  evidence  when  finding
    that the relevant �50,000 had not been taken into account.

13.  At the beginning of the appeal before me  I  endeavoured  to  ascertain
    from Mr Solomon what evidence had been submitted with the  applications
    or indeed at any other time prior to the decision by the appellants  or
    by their representatives.  He had no copy of any covering  letter  sent
    in with the application forms let  alone  any  appropriately  paginated
    bundles of enclosures with the original applications.  He  referred  to
    evidence from a Barclays Bank account which  was  in  the  respondent's
    bundle and claimed that  a  letter  from  the  appellants'  accountants
    showed sums totalling  �18,191  invested  in  the  business.   He  also
    referred to a sum of �22, 492.79 in Mr Al Mamun's Halifax account at C9
    of the bundle.  He argued that those three amounts amounted to  �52,117
    and that this was not disputed.  He accepted that certain sums  had  to
    be retained for maintenance but stated that that was evident  from  the
    documentation before me.  He stated that there was evidence of money in
    the Somali Bank and the National Bank of Bangladesh and at the date  of
    submission there had been no list of appropriate financial institutions
    in which money had been invested.

14.  In reply Mr Whitwell stated that it was clear  from  the  determination
    that it is accepted by the appellants that the invoices to evidence the
    sum of �18,191  supposedly  invested  in  the  business  had  not  been
    submitted  with the application. He referred to the  fact  that  Mr  Al
    Mamun accepted the advertisement was sent after  the  application  form
    had been submitted.  He accepted that the invoices were also  not  sent
    with the application form.

15.  It was Mr Whitwell's argument that in any event the  invoices  appeared
    to indicate double accounting.  He referred me to the grounds of appeal
    and stated that the  sums  to  which  reference  was  made  therein  in
    paragraphs 8, 9, 10 and 11 of the grounds totalled �47,231.52.  He also
    referred to discrepancies relating to the second appellant's claim that
    he had �22,492 in his Halifax account - he referred to  the  fact  that
    there was a discrepancy in the numbers relating to the Halifax account.
     In any event he pointed out the Halifax account appeared to be a joint
    account.

16.  He therefore asked me to find that there was no material error  of  law
    in the determination of the judge.

17.  In  reply Mr Solomon indicated that there was an error of law  in  that
    the judge had not considered the Article 8 rights of the appellants and
    furthermore that there had been a Section 47  decision  which  had  not
    been withdrawn.

Discussion

18.  With regard to the Section 47 decision I allow the appeal  with  regard
    to that decision. With regard to the Article 8 rights of the appellants
    I accept that these were not considered by the judge but these were not
    raised in the grounds of nor was that issue raised at the  hearing  and
    certainly there was nothing put before me to indicate that the  removal
    of the appellants would be disproportionate - they had both  come  here
    relatively recently as students and then been granted leave  to  remain
    as Tier 1 Migrants for a limited period.

19.  With regard to the substance of the appeal the reality is that  as  the
    judge stated  the  burden  of  proof  is  on  the  appellants.   It  is
    extraordinary that the appellants' representatives were unable  to  put
    before  me  a  copy  of  the  initial  application  together  with  the
    supporting documents  which  were  sent  to  the  respondent  when  the
    applications were made.  The appellants' bundles of documents  did  not
    include a copy of a covering letter and there really is  no  indication
    as to what documents were sent to the respondent, other than  those  to
    which the refusals referred,  and when they were sent.  The reality  is
    that the grounds of appeal before the First-tier Judge and those to the
    Upper Tribunal and indeed Mr  Solomon's  submissions  to  me  contained
    assertions that certain funds were available and that evidence of those
    funds had been sent to the Home Office but  there  little  to  back  up
    those assertions.  The burden of proof lies on  the  appellants.   That
    burden of proof has not been discharged.  It  is,  of  course,  correct
    that in a points-based system  case  it  is  the  documents  which  are
    produced at the date of application which  are  relevant.   Given  that
    there is nothing to show what documents were  actually  submitted  with
    the application other than those to which  reference  is  made  in  the
    notices of refusal, I cannot accept that all  relevant  documents  were
    submitted to the Secretary of State with the  application.  Indeed,  in
    any event,  it was accepted that the invoices substantiating  the  sums
    which it was claimed had  been invested to make up the �18,191 to which
    reference was made in the accountant's letter,  were not submitted with
    the accountant's  letter  which  indeed  itself  was  dated  after  the
    application. I would add that  I am not satisfied that  there  has  not
    been  double accounting of the funds claimed  -  it  is  impossible  to
    ascertain  what money  was available  and when it  was  available   for
    the  enterprise.  I am also concerned that, before the Judge  reference
    was made to both partners having relevant funds  which  were  available
    from Bangladesh and therefore, presumably required  for  the  business,
    but that that issue was not pursued before me.

20.  I therefore find that the judge reached conclusions which were open  to
    him on the evidence and that therefore there  is no material  error  of
    law in the determination of the judge and although I have  allowed  the
    appeals against the Section  47  decision  I  dismiss  the  substantive
    appeals.

Decision.
         I allow the appeals against the decision to  remove  under  Section
    47 of the Immigration  Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.
         I dismiss appeals on Immigration grounds.
