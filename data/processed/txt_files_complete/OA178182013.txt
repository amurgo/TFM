                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The Entry Clearance Officer  appeals  against  the  decision  of  Judge
    Hindson to allow the appeal of Mrs Parastoo Shafie against  refusal  of
    her application for entry clearance as the spouse of a  person  present
    and settled in the United Kingdom.  For  ease  of  reference,  I  shall
    hereafter refer to the parties in accordance with their status  in  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

Background to the appeal

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Iran who was born on the 18th July  1989.
    On the 30th April 2013, she applied for entry clearance as  the  spouse
    of Mr Hamid Beshkar (hereafter, "the sponsor"). The respondent  refused
    the application in two separate Notices of Immigration Decision. In the
    first, dated the 17th July 2013, the respondent refused the application
    on the ground that s/he  was  not  satisfied  that  the  appellant  and
    sponsor were in a genuine and subsisting relationship. In  the  second,
    dated the 24th June 2014, it was additionally  refused  on  the  ground
    that the appellant had not submitted all the 'specified documents' that
    were required by Appendix FM-SE of the Immigration Rules. So far as the
    latter was concerned, the respondent identified, by reference  to  each
    document specified by Appendix FM-SE  in  respect  of  a  self-employed
    person, those documents that  the  appellant  either  had  or  had  not
    submitted with her application.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal

 3. Judge Hindson found that the appellant had proved that her relationship
    was genuine and subsisting [see paragraphs 19 to 21]. That  finding  is
    not challenged by the respondent in this appeal.

 4. Under the heading, 'The Financial  Requirements',  the  judge  said  as
    follows:

         "22  The sponsor has provided a number of documents in  support  of
             his claim to be self-employed as a mobile  hairdresser.  These
             include a letter from HMRC registering  him  as  self-employed
             and advising him of his  Unique  Taxpayer  Reference.  I  have
             evidence of payment of  national  insurance  contributions  in
             2012 and 2013. I have copies of his tax return  for  the  year
             ended April 2014. I have his tax calculations  for  that  year
             which shows an income before tax of �19,594. I  have  the  tax
             calculations for the year ended 2013 in which that  figure  is
             �12,811. I have receipts showing tax paid.  In  addition,  the
             sponsor's bank statements are in the respondent's bundle.

         23. Taking all the evidence in the round, I am satisfied that  the
             appellant has a net profit before tax which is  in  excess  of
             the �18,600 requirements. So far as the specified evidence  is
             concerned, Mr Mullarkey was unable to  point  to  any  of  the
             individual evidential requirements that had not been met. Miss
             Khan contended that all of the requirements had been  met  and
             took  me  to  the  relevant  document  in  respect   of   each
             requirement. I  am  therefore  satisfied  that  the  specified
             evidence requirements are also satisfied."

The grounds of appeal

 5. The  grounds  of  appeal  are  conveniently  summarised  in  the  third
    paragraph of the grant by Upper Tribunal Judge Martin of permission  to
    appeal:

         "It is arguable, as asserted in the grounds,  that  the  Judge  has
         erred in looking at the documents and income at the wrong date. The
         relevant date under the Rules for income and the specified evidence
         as to income is the date  of  application,  which  was  30th  April
         2013."

Analysis

 6. Mrs Pettersen relied upon the grounds of appeal.  Mr  George  submitted
    that by reading paragraphs 22  and  23  of  the  judge's  determination
    together, it could be inferred that the judge had before  him  evidence
    not only of the sponsor's tax return and calculation for the  financial
    year ending in April 2014, but also that which immediately preceded the
    application  as  required  by  the  Immigration  Rules.  I  prefer  the
    arguments of Mrs Pettersen for the following reasons.

 7. It is far from clear from his determination that the judge did in  fact
    have before him any or all the specified documents that were identified
    by the respondent as missing at the time of the application. Indeed, it
    is difficult to see why the judge should have made any reference at all
    to the sponsor's tax return and calculation  for  the  year  ending  in
    April 2014 if he had been in possession of the relevant documents  that
    were required by the Rules. Moreover, the mere fact that the Presenting
    Officer was "unable to  point  to  any  of  the  individual  evidential
    requirements that had  not  been  met"  could  not  have  assisted  the
    appellant. This is because the onus was upon her to establish that  the
    requirements of the Rules were met, rather than upon the respondent  to
    establish that they were not.  Furthermore,  in  view  of  the  judge's
    earlier references to a tax return and calculation  for  the  incorrect
    year, his generalised reference to Counsel having  taken  him  "to  the
    relevant document in respect  of  each  requirement"  is  incapable  of
    demonstrating that he had subjected her submission  that  "all  of  the
    requirements had been met" to any significant  degree  of  scrutiny.  I
    therefore set aside this aspect of his determination, whilst preserving
    that relating to the genuineness of the appellant's  relationship  with
    the sponsor.

The way forward

 8. It obviously occurred to me that I might proceed to  re-determine  this
    appeal in the Upper Tribunal. However,  I  concluded  that  there  were
    insuperable obstacles to my doing so. Although I had a  faxed  copy  of
    the appellant's bundle of documents, it was by no means  apparent  that
    this contained the documents  to  which  Judge  Hindson  had  referred,
    albeit in the most general of terms, in holding that  the  requirements
    of Appendix FM-SE of  the  Immigration  Rules  were  met.  I  therefore
    concluded that the fairest course was to remit the appeal to First-tier
    Tribunal, preferably to Judge Hindson, with a view  to  the  making  of
    specific findings as to how identified documents are said to  meet  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules. In order to assist the  Tribunal
    in this endeavour, I direct the appellant to  draw  up  a  schedule  in
    which individual documents are (i) described, (ii) referred to by  page
    number in an accompanying bundle, and  (iii)  cross-referenced  to  the
    particular provision of Appendix  FM-SE  to  which  they  are  said  to
    relate.  For the avoidance of doubt, I make it  clear  that  (a)  Judge
    Hindson's finding that the parties were in  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    marriage at the date of the decision is to be preserved, and  (ii)  the
    Tribunal may consider any such further documents as the  appellant  may
    submit with a view to  showing  that  she  meets  the  requirements  of
    Appendix FM-SE of the Immigration Rules, provided (and I cannot  stress
    this enough) they cover prescribed time-period(s) by reference  to  the
    date of the original application.

Notice of decision

 9. The appeal is allowed on the ground that the First-tier Tribunal made a
    material error of  law  in  its  assessment  of  which  documents  were
    relevant to meeting the requirements of Appendix FM-SE.

10. The  appeal  is  remitted  to  a  judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal;
    preferably, but subject to the overriding discretion  of  the  Resident
    Judge at Bradford, to Judge Hindson.

Anonymity is not directed.
