                       (ANONYMITY DIRECTION NOT MADE)

                                                                  Respondent
Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Saunders (Home Office Presenting
      Officer)
For the Respondent:    Mr Adewole (Legal Representative)

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. Although this is an appeal by the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department I will refer below to the parties as they were identified at
    the First-tier Hearing namely the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department will from hereon be referred to as  the  respondent  and  Mr
    Terence Yves Ibala as the appellant.

 2. The appellant, born October 21, 1994, is a citizen  of  the  Congo.  He
    arrived in the United Kingdom and claimed asylum on September 22,  2011
    but his application was refused on December 13, 2011.  He  was  however
    granted limited leave on discretionary grounds  starting  November  28,
    2011 and ending on April 21, 2012. He then submitted an application  on
    April 17, 2012 for leave to remain under paragraph 298 HC 395. When  he
    submitted his application he was 17 � years of age.

 3. The respondent refused his application on January 17, 2013 and  at  the
    same time issued directions to remove  him  under  section  47  of  the
    Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

 4. On February 5, 2013 the appellant appealed under section 82(1)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

 5. The matter was listed before Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Iqbal
    (hereinafter referred to as "the FtTJ") on February 4, 2014  and  in  a
    determination promulgated on March 12, 2014 he allowed the appeal under
    paragraphs 298 and 276ADE of the Immigration Rules.

 6. The respondent appealed that decision on March 20, 2014. Permission  to
    appeal was granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Lever  on  April
    25, 2014 who found in particular merit to ground one of the grounds. He
    further states that he felt the FtTJ had  given  adequate  reasons  for
    allowing the appeal under paragraph 276ADE HC 395.

 7. The matter was listed before me on the above date and the appellant was
    in attendance.

    SUBMISSIONS


 8. Mr Saunders submitted the  FtTJ  had  erred  in  his  approach  to  the
    paragraph 298 application. In order to be granted indefinite  leave  to
    remain under this paragraph the appellant had  to  show  amongst  other
    requirements that he was under the age of 18 (paragraph  298(ii)(a)  HC
    2395). At the time the application  was  submitted  the  appellant  was
    under the age of 18 but at the date of decision he was over the age  of
    18. The refusal letter pointed out that as his discretionary leave  had
    not been granted under paragraph 302 or  paragraph  319R  or  Paragraph
    319X or Appendix FM he could not satisfy paragraph  298(ii).  The  FtTJ
    had been addressed on this issue and found  the  appellant  was  exempt
    under paragraph 27 HC 395.


 9. However Mr Saunders submitted paragraph 27 HC 395 did not apply to this
    application because paragraph 27 states-

        "An application for entry clearance is to be decided in  the  light
        of the circumstances existing at the time of the  decision,  except
        that an applicant will not be  refused  an  entry  clearance  where
        entry is sought in one of the categories  contained  in  paragraphs
        296-316 or paragraph EC-C of Appendix FM solely on account  of  his
        attaining the age of 18 years between receipt  of  his  application
        and the date of the decision on it."

    Chapter 8 Section 5a paragraph 2.3  of  the  IDI  made  it  clear  that
    applications for leave or further leave to remain should be  considered
    in light of the circumstances existing at the date of the decision  and
    where the child was over 18 at the date of decision but his application
    had been lodged before he reached 18 the application should be  decided
    as if he was still under 18. Mr Saunders submitted that this had to  be
    read alongside the next paragraph that made  it  clear  it  applied  to
    applications under paragraphs 320 and 319XA.

10.  Mr  Saunders  further  submitted  that  if  the  Tribunal  upheld  the
    application of paragraph 27 the FtTJ had still erred in his approach to
    paragraph 298 and in particular:


     a. His failure to give reasons why  the  exclusion  of  the  appellant
        would be undesirable.
     b. His finding there  are  serious  and  compelling  family  or  other
        considerations.


11. As regards the third ground of appeal  Mr  Saunders  did  not  wish  to
    address me on that as he accepted the judge  who  gave  permission  had
    stated that the FtTJ  appeared  to  have  given  adequate  reasons  for
    allowing the appeal under paragraph 276ADE HC 395.


12. Mr Adewole submitted that paragraph 27 of  the  Immigration  Rules  did
    cover the appellant. He referred to the IDI guidance and  he  submitted
    that as the application was submitted when he was under the age  of  18
    the respondent should have treated him as  under  18  even  though  the
    decision was taken after he was 18 years old. Paragraph 298 (ii) HC 395
    applied to appellants who were seeking indefinite leave to  remain  and
    already had limited leave to enter or remain and were under the age  of
    18.


13.  Mr  Adewole  further  submitted  that  the  FtTJ  had  given   careful
    consideration to the whole case and had  given  reasons  why  he  found
    exclusion  would  be  undesirable  and  why  there  were  serious   and
    compelling family or other considerations. He submitted  there  was  no
    error in law.

    ERROR OF LAW ASSESSMENT

14. There are in effect two primary grounds of appeal. The first relates to
    whether the appellant should be considered to be under the age of 18 at
    the date of decision.


15. Whilst Mr Saunders' arguments had been found to have merit by Judge  of
    the First-tier Tribunal Lever I  am  satisfied  that  his  argument  in
    respect of paragraph 27 HC 395 has no merit. I  reach  that  conclusion
    for the following reasons:-

     a. The IDI's clearly envisage applications other than entry  clearance
        because section 2.1 (Chapter 8 Section 5A) relates to  guidance  on
        entry clearance, 2.2 relates "on entry" and 2.3 relates  to  "After
        entry". I do not believe that the first paragraph of 2.3 has to  be
        read in conjunction with the second or third paragraphs.


     b. In SO (Nigeria) v SSHD  2006  EWCA  Civ  76  the  Court  of  Appeal
        confirmed that the Tribunal was correct that, if  paragraph  27  of
        the Immigration Rules was read in conjunction with guidance set out
        in the IDIs, an application for leave to remain as  a  child  could
        not be refused solely on account of a claimant attaining  18  years
        of age since the date of lodgement.

16. I therefore find that ground one has no merit.


17. I turn to the second ground of  appeal.  This  relates  to  the  FtTJ's
    assessment of whether there any serious  and  compelling  circumstances
    that made exclusion undesirable.

18. The Court of Appeal in SO stated that a claimant's  age,  maturity  and
    independence had to be relevant factors in assessing  whether  "serious
    and compelling reasons" existed in terms of paragraph 298 and  on  that
    issue the Adjudicator did not err in law by  taking  into  account  the
    fact that the claimants had reached the age of 18 by the  date  of  the
    hearing.

19. The FtTJ considered the evidence between paragraphs [23] and  [36]  and
    made a number of findings. He had regard to  the  appellant's  age  and
    circumstances and also considered the authority of Mundeba [2013]  UKUT
    88 (IAC). The FtTJ noted:-

     a. He had no family to return to in Congo.
     b. His half-sister and cousin live in the United Kingdom and he  lives
        with them and she takes care of him.
     c. He has completed a number of subjects at  college  and  now  had  a
        conditional offer  to  study  computer  science  at  two  different
        universities.
     d. The circumstances that prevailed when he  arrived  in  the  country
        continued to apply namely there was no  adequate  accommodation  or
        reception facilities for him in Congo.
     e. The appellant has lived in Gabon since the age  of  three  and  his
        mother lived in Congo and is retired and it would e  difficult  for
        her to look after him.
     f. The appellant has no ties to Congo  be  they  social,  cultural  or
        family because he has lived in Gabon since the age of three.

20. Whilst the FtTJ did not specifically consider the appellant's  position
    as a 19� year old male he did have regard to all the  relevant  factors
    and he had the benefit of hearing the appellant's oral evidence and  he
    made findings that were open to him.  In  those  circumstances  I  find
    there has been no material error.

    DECISION

21. There is no material error of law. The original decision shall stand.

22. Under Rule 14(1) The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (as
    amended) the  appellant  can  be  granted  anonymity  throughout  these
    proceedings, unless and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise. No
    order has been made and no request for an order was submitted to me.
