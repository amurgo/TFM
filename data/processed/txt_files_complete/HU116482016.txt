Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant, who is a national of Thailand, appeals from the decision
    made by the First-tier Tribunal  to  dismiss  her  appeal  against  the
    decision of an Entry Clearance Officer to refuse  her  entry  clearance
    for the purposes of settlement as the spouse  of  a  British  national.
    The appeal was dismissed for non-compliance  with  the  minimum  income
    requirement ("MIR"). The reason why she was able to attend the  hearing
    before me with her husband was because, following the  refusal  of  her
    settlement  application,  she  has  successfully  applied   for   entry
    clearance as a visitor for a  period  of  six  months.  The  First-tier
    Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction, and I  do  consider  that
    the appellant needs  anonymity  for  these  proceedings  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Relevant Background Facts

 2. The appellant applied for entry clearance as a spouse on 17 March 2016.
    On 30 March 2016 an Entry Clearance Officer in Bangkok (Post reference:
    BKK/1027917) gave his reasons for refusing her  application.   She  had
    declared in Appendix 2 of her application, that  her  sponsor  met  the
    financial requirements through cash savings of �28,794.85, but she  had
    not  met  the  evidential  requirement  of  providing   personal   bank
    statements showing that cash savings have been held in  an  account  in
    the name of a persons or of the person and their partner jointly for at
    least 6 months prior to the date of application.

 3. She had submitted a Halifax account ending  [      ],  which  showed  a
    final balance of �23,367.  The account indicated  that  the  amount  of
    �25,196.97 was deposited into the account on 1 February 2016  from  her
    sponsor's "Nutmeg" account.   She  had  also  submitted  an  investment
    report and portfolio from her sponsor's "Nutmeg" account.  This  report
    covered the period from April to  October  2015  only.   Although  this
    demonstrated that the sponsor was in possession of this amount, it  did
    not cover the required 6-month period prior to the date of application.

 4. She  had  also  submitted  the  following  bank  statements  evidencing
    further funds held by the sponsor:

 a) A TSB account ending [        ] from the period  5  August  2015  to  2
    March 2016;

 b) A Halifax ISA Saver account ending [     ] covering the period  9  July
    2015 to 1 December 2015; and

 c) A Halifax account ending [    ] from 1 February  2016  to  29  February
    2016.

 5. These  bank  statements  did  not  cover  the  entire  period  required
    "collectively". Accordingly, she had not submitted  all  the  mandatory
    documents required under Appendix FM-SE  to  show  the  sponsor's  cash
    savings.  In addition, the sponsor would appear  to  have  insufficient
    cash savings available in order to qualify in  this  capacity,  as  the
    minimum amount required was �62,500.

 6. She had also declared that the sponsor had an  income  of  �14,244  per
    year, and so he had considered whether his sponsor was able to meet the
    minimum income requirement (MIR)  through  a  combination  of  salaried
    employment and cash savings.

 7. In respect of salaried employment in the UK, all the mandatory evidence
    had been provided except personal bank statements corresponding to  the
    same period as the payslips, showing that a salary had been  paid  into
    an account in the name of the person or the  name  of  the  person  and
    their partner jointly.  The reason that the requirement was not met was
    because the TSB statements for the account ending [    ]   only covered
    the period 18 January 2016 to 11 March 2016.

 8. He had considered the question of  evidential  flexibility.   This  was
    confined to cases where applicants had  submitted  a  document  in  the
    wrong format, a copy document rather than an  original,  or  where  one
    document in a series was missing.  While she had provided some  of  the
    necessary specified evidence, the documentation submitted did not  show
    that her sponsor's income was as stated.  So he was satisfied that  the
    decision not to  allow  evidential  flexibility  in  her  case  was  in
    accordance with the law.

The Grounds of Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

 9. The grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal were  settled  on  the
    appellant's behalf by Scott Moncrieff Solicitors. They pleaded that the
    decision to refuse was disproportionate and contrary to Article 8 ECHR.
     The ECO had failed to fully consider and/or give sufficient weight  to
    the evidence  submitted,  particularly  in  respect  of  the  sponsor's
    earnings.  The decision-maker had failed to use evidential  flexibility
    and had neglected to contact the appellant for clarity.   Their  client
    (sic) clearly had relevant cash savings in his "Nutmeg" account,  which
    were transferred to his bank.  So, taking into reasonable consideration
    all his financial cash assets, it was reasonable to  conclude  that  he
    possessed the relevant savings.   Evidential  flexibility  should  have
    been sufficient to draw the appropriate  conclusion  from  the  various
    bank accounts.  The fact that he  had  multiple  accounts  and  savings
    showed a genuine set of financial circumstances.  There was no question
    of the applicant (sic) having constructed his finances at short  notice
    in  order  to  bolster  his  application.   The  refusal  decision  was
    irrational and unreasonable. Furthermore, it was not feasible  for  the
    sponsor to leave the UK to start life in Thailand, as he had his career
    and family in the UK.

The Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

10. The appellant asked for her appeal to be determined on the papers.  The
    appeal came before Judge Gurung-Thapa sitting at Stoke on  21  November
    2016.

11. In her subsequent decision, the Judge  found  that  the  appellant  had
    provided a series of  bank  statements  covering  a  six  month  period
    running from September 2015 through to the end of February 2016  so  as
    to satisfy the requirement which had been put in  issue  by  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer as to proof of  earnings  from  salaried  employment.
    The Judge accepted the evidence of the  appellant  that  the  sponsor's
    income from his salaried employment was initially paid into his Halifax
    account, but after January 2016 it was paid into his TSB account.

12. With regard to cash savings, the Judge held that she  could  take  into
    account the funds which the sponsor had held in the "Nutmeg" investment
    account.  With the application, the appellant had provided a  valuation
    report covering the period April to October 2015.  For the purposes  of
    the appeal, she had now provided a valuation report covering  the  next
    six months up to 5 April 2016.  She directed herself that she could not
    take this into consideration as it was not available  at  the  date  of
    decision.

13. However, she held that was not the end of the matter, as there was  the
    sum of �25,196.87 which was transferred from the "Nutmeg" account on  1
    February 2016. She noted that the appellant also relied  on  cash  sums
    held by the sponsor in three other accounts.  But she  found  that  the
    appellant had not submitted bank statements covering the entire  period
    of six months.

14. On the topic of evidential flexibility, the Judge held that  there  was
    no near-miss principle to save a defective application unless the error
    came within the limited provisions of Appendix FM-SE paragraph  D,  and
    in particular sub-paragraph (b).

15. With regard to a claim  under  Article  8  ECHR,  she  found  that  the
    appellant had not been able to show that  she  could  not  satisfy  the
    requirements of the Rules if she was to make a  fresh  entry  clearance
    application.

The Grant of Permission to Appeal

16. The appellant's legal representatives settled a lengthy application for
    permission to appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal,  raising  a  number  of
    distinct grounds.  However, in the grant of  permission  dated  5  June
    2017, First-tier Tribunal Judge Grant granted permission  on  a  ground
    that cannot clearly be cross-referenced to a  ground  advanced  by  the
    appellant's solicitors.  The Judge granted the appellant permission  to
    appeal on the ground that the Judge  had  "arguably  misunderstood  the
    content  of  the  bank  statement  placed  before  her   and   arguably
    misunderstood that it was supplied with the application".

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

17. At the hearing before me, the appellant was  not  legally  represented.
    Her husband and sponsor, Mr Hughes, explained that they had decided  to
    dispense with the services of their solicitor on the grounds  of  cost.
    I asked him about the bank statement which had been referred to by  the
    Judge granting  permission  to  appeal.   He  handed  up  a  bundle  of
    documents, on the front page of which was written in  manuscript  "Soda
    Further Evidence UT".  The bundle contained a bank statement in respect
    of his account with TSB  ending  [         ],  covering  the  period  I
    September 2015 to 25 November 2015.  He said that this  bank  statement
    had been accidentally omitted from the bank statements put  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge.  However, his  case  was  that  it  did  not
    matter if the funds in this particular account were  not  brought  into
    the equation when assessing whether he had held savings of �26,890  for
    the six-month period preceding the date of application.   He  submitted
    that, on a proper analysis of the material that was before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge, she ought to have found that he had shown that  he
    had held the necessary amount of savings for six months, so as to  make
    up the shortfall between his salaried income and the MIR of �18,600. On
    behalf of the respondent, Mr Tarlow submitted that no error of law  was
    made out.

Discussion

18. The narrow ground on which permission to appeal was granted is not made
    out. Mr Hughes has confirmed that the error of law challenge  does  not
    hinge on the Judge below having wrongly overlooked the  bank  statement
    referred to by the judge granting permission. He accepts that this bank
    statement was not before the Judge.

19. So I turn to the error of law challenge as it was presented to me by Mr
    Hughes  in  his  lucid  oral  submissions.  I  agree  with  Mr  Hughes'
    calculation as to the amount of cash savings which he  needed  to  have
    held for a continuous period of six months in  order  to  make  up  the
    shortfall between his accepted salary income of �14,244 and the MIR  of
    �18,600.  His calculated figure of �26,890 corresponds to my calculated
    figure.

20. As evidence of savings, the appellant  has  always  principally  relied
    upon the funds held by the sponsor in his Nutmeg investment  portfolio,
    which was liquidated  at  the  beginning  of  February  2016,  and  the
    proceeds transferred into his Halifax account ending [       ],  which,
    as noted in the refusal decision, showed a final  balance  of  �23,367.
    At the  time  of  decision,  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  reasonably
    excluded from consideration the Nutmeg  investment  portfolio,  as  the
    appellant had not satisfied the requirement of showing the  cash  value
    of the funds in the form of an investment at or before the beginning of
    the period of six months prior to the  date  of  application,  and  the
    continuing cash value of the funds up until the transfer of  the  funds
    to the Halifax account.

21. The First-tier Tribunal Judge was wrong  to  direct  herself  that  she
    could not take into account the additional evidence provided by way  of
    appeal. The new evidence showed the valuation of the investment fund in
    the months leading  up  to  its  liquidation,  and  it  was  admissible
    notwithstanding the fact that it was not available at the time  of  the
    refusal decision. However the Judge's erroneous self-direction was  not
    material, for reasons which will become apparent.

22. The evidence provided by way of appeal showed that  the  portfolio  had
    hovered at around �25,000 in value from April  2015  to  January  2016.
    Occasionally, the value of the fund had  dropped  slightly  below  this
    level, but mainly it was higher (A5).  The valuation report at  A4  for
    the six-month period from October 2015 gives a more  accurate  picture.
    The starting value of the fund on 6 April 2015 was �22,629.76.  At  the
    beginning of the relevant period (3 September 2015) the portfolio value
    was in excess of �25,000 and it remained above that  level  through  to
    the end of the period.  The valuation report for the 6-month period  to
    5 April 2016 (A6) is less specific, but it is apparent  from  the  bar-
    chart that the balance is always well  in  excess  of  �23,500  and  is
    always close to �25,000.  The balance in the Halifax account  following
    transfer does not appear to have fallen below the final balance  figure
    quoted by the respondent in the refusal decision, and  accordingly  the
    Judge ought to have found that the appellant had established savings of
    this amount (�23,367) as being held by the sponsor for a period of  six
    months.

23. But there is still a significant shortfall  of  about  �3,500  in  cash
    savings to reach the target of �26,890, and I am not persuaded that the
    Judge erred in finding that there was a near  miss  case.   It  is  not
    disputed that in one of the other bank accounts  sought  to  be  relied
    upon, the Judge was only  provided  with  bank  statements  covering  a
    period of three months.  This was the TSB account ending  [       ]  at
    B4.  Confusingly, the sponsor also had a TSB account  ending  [      ],
    which is at B5.  But this account runs from the period 2 November  2015
    to 3 May 2016, and the balances shown are very modest.  On  2  November
    2015 the balance was �250.  As a result of the payment in of �250  each
    month, the balance was �1,250 on 2 March  2016.   At  B6,  there  is  a
    statement in respect of an account  ending  [          ]  held  by  the
    sponsor with the Halifax Bank.  The statement was printed in Branch  on
    11 May 2016.  The account was apparently opened on 1 December 2015 with
    the transfer in of the sum of �1,000.  This was not money held  in  the
    account for  a  period  of  six  months  leading  up  to  the  date  of
    application, and so it cannot be taken into account.  The deposit  into
    the account may have originated  from  another  ISA  Account  ending  [
    ] held by the sponsor with Halifax, as at B7 there is a transfer out on
    1 December 2015 of the sum of �1,000, leaving a balance  of  �1,022.03.
    However, it is not possible to discern from the information given at B7
    when the account was opened.

24. Moreover, even if it is assumed in  the  appellant's  favour  that  the
    sponsor held the sum of just over �2,000 for a continuous period of six
    months in various ISA accounts with Halifax  Bank,  the  deployment  of
    this sum is not enough to reach the target of �26,980. There is still a
    shortfall of about �1,500.

25. In conclusion, I do not consider that the Judge erred in law in finding
    that the appellant has not discharged the  evidential  requirements  of
    Appendix FM-SE so as to show that the MIR is met.  As  I  explained  to
    the Appellant and the sponsor at the hearing, in a case  such  as  this
    where the applicant is relying on savings held in a number of different
    accounts and where the accounts have fluctuating balances (and  in  the
    case of an investment portfolio, a fluctuating cash valuation),  it  is
    reasonable to expect the applicant to provide a schedule which gives  a
    day-by-day analysis of the total balance in savings held by the sponsor
    across the various accounts.   It  is  not  reasonable  to  expect  the
    decision-maker to pore over  the  transactions  shown  in  the  various
    accounts in order to try and work out  the  minimum  total  balance  in
    savings that has been held  over  various  accounts  for  the  relevant
    period of six months.  In any event,  for  the  reasons  I  have  given
    above, I am unable to ascertain that the sponsor held cash  savings  of
    �26,890 for the six-month period preceding the date of  application  on
    the evidence that was provided to the First-tier Tribunal Judge.

26. There is no error in the Judge's finding on evidential flexibility.  It
    was open to the appellant and sponsor to provide all the necessary bank
    statements and valuation reports by way  of  appeal,  together  with  a
    comprehensive  schedule  as  discussed  above,  to  show  clearly   and
    transparently that the MIR was met through cash savings of the required
    amount, if that was truly the case.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not contain  an  error  of  law,
and accordingly the decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands.

This appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.

I make no anonymity direction.
