                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. Although this is an appeal by the Secretary of State I  will  refer  to
    the parties as they were before the First- tier Tribunal.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born on 12th  October  1972.  She
    applied for a residence card on 15th May  2012  as  the  spouse  of  Mr
    Fritzgerald Alberto Hoyer, a citizen of the  Netherlands  born  on  7th
    August 1970 who is said to be exercising Treaty rights in the  UK.  The
    couple had had a Ghanaian customary marriage by proxy on  21st  October
    2011. The application was refused  on  8th  October  2012.  Her  appeal
    against the decision was allowed by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Handley
    in a determination promulgated on the 19th May 2014.

 3. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Haynes on 2nd July 2014  on the basis that it  was  arguable  that  the
    First-tier judge had erred in law in failing  to  apply  Kareem  (Proxy
    marriages - EU law) [2014] UKUT 00024.  I  found  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal had erred in law on 22nd August 2014 for reasons set out in my
    decision with is appended at Annex A to this determination, and set the
    determination of Judge Handley aside in its entirety.

 4. The matter came before me to remake the decision.  The  rehearing  took
    place on 10th October 2014 and 16th January 2015. The hearing  on  10th
    October 2014 was adjourned when it became clear that Mr Hoyer could not
    speak Spanish to a sufficient level to understand the  interpreter.  On
    28th November 2014 there  was  a  for  mention  hearing  at  which  the
    respondent confirmed that she did not wish  to  re-interview  Mr  Hoyer
    with a Dutch interpreter prior to concluding the re-making hearing.

 5. Mr Osifeso confirmed that the appellant was arguing only that  she  was
    entitled to a residence permit as a durable partner of Mr  Hoyer  under
    Regulation 8(5) of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations  2006  (henceforth
    the EEA Regulations) as she was not in a  position  to  show  that  her
    Ghanaian proxy marriage was valid in the Netherlands,  and  thus  could
    not meet the requirements for a residence  card  as  a  wife  following
    Kareem (Proxy marriages - EU law).

Evidence

 6. The appellant attended the Tribunal and gave  evidence.  She  confirmed
    her name and address, and that her statement was true and  correct  and
    her evidence to the Tribunal. In her statement in summary she  says  as
    follows. She was raised in Nigeria and then relocated to  the  UK.  She
    lives at Ethnard Road  in  Peckham  with  her  husband  Mr  Fritzgerald
    Alberto Hoyer who was is a Dutch citizen working in the UK.  They  were
    married under the customary laws of Ghana (her  second  home)  on  21st
    October 2011, and although they were not present they had a small party
    in the UK with friends and family members. They decided to have  a  big
    wedding party when they could afford it and when they were both able to
    travel. They were very disappointed by the refusal decision.  She  felt
    it was unfair to judge the relationship based on questions at interview
    as there had been problems for her husband with the Spanish interpreter
    and they were both nervous, not having  experienced  such  a  situation
    before.

 7. In oral evidence the appellant added, in summary, as follows.  She  had
    found the interviewer had asked questions very fast  at  the  interview
    and she felt unprepared and did not know what to say. She said that  Mr
    Hoyer had lived at the address in Ethnard Road before she  had.  Before
    she moved in with Mr Hoyer she had lived at Chillam House  on  the  Old
    Kent Road. Mr Hoyer always went to work  at  4am  in  the  morning.  Mr
    Hoyer's birthday was on 7th August 1970. This year she had made a  cake
    and taken pictures, and cooked food. This was not done precisely on his
    birthday but on the Saturday after his birthday.

 8. Her Nationwide bank statement was in her maiden name as she did not use
    a "married" name.

 9. Mr Hoyer and she lived in a shared flat with others  from  Poland.  She
    does not know the names of the other flat sharers, and had not  noticed
    them on letters. The flat has three bedrooms and a shared  kitchen  and
    bathroom. There is a TV in the  shared  sitting  room.  She  has  shelf
    number one for her pots pans and food items in the kitchen. There is  a
    washing machine  in  the  flat.  Their  bedroom  has  black  and  brown
    curtains; a bed with sheets and  duvet;  no  bedside  table;  no  alarm
    clock; and no TV. She had brought a freezer for the flat.

10. She has a sister called Gloria who visited the  UK  but  who  lives  in
    Nigeria. No other relatives have  visited  from  Nigeria.  She  has  no
    relatives in the UK. She has a friend in the UK called Miriam. Mr Hoyer
    has a friend called Daniel who visits - but the last time he was  there
    was a long time ago for Mr Hoyer's birthday.

11. The photos taken on 5th October 2012 were taken on an outing where they
    saw funny things.

12. Mr Fritzgerald Alberto Hoyer attended the Tribunal  and  gave  evidence
    through the Dutch interpreter  whom  he  confirmed  he  understood.  He
    confirmed his name and address, and that his  statement  was  true  and
    correct and his evidence to the Tribunal. In his statement, in summary,
    he says as follows. He is very much in love with the appellant who  has
    shown herself to be a caring and gentle wife compared to his previously
    relationships. He  found  it  difficult  to  answer  the  questions  at
    interview because of problems with the Spanish interpreter and  because
    he found the interview context strange and difficult.

13. In oral evidence he added as follows. He had first come to  the  UK  in
    2003. He was last in the Netherlands in 2014, before  his  birthday  in
    about June. He went to visit his two children there. His children  live
    with their mother, to whom he was  never  married.  He  first  met  the
    appellant in August 2011 in a supermarket. He understood the  appellant
    thought they had met in August 2010 but he thought it was August 2011.

14. They had started to live together  in  October  2011.  They  had  lived
    together only at Ethnard Road.  The accommodation  was  a  one  bedroom
    flat with living room on the ground floor. Above them  lived  a  couple
    but he did not know them. He and the appellant rented the flat. He  did
    not know the woman they rented from  as  the  appellant  made  all  the
    arrangements with money. He knew nothing about the  tenancy  agreement,
    rent book  or  rent  payment  receipts  as  the  appellant  made  these
    arrangements. The rent was �500 a month. The appellant had lived  there
    before he had: he had joined her there when they started to cohabit, so
    the appellant had sorted out the tenancy agreement  with  the  landlord
    etc.  He gives the appellant money to pay the landlord.

15. His pet name for the appellant is "mummy" and hers for him  is  "Bato".
    Bato is a Spanish world with no particular meaning. He thought  it  was
    normal that his surname was on the birthday cake rather  than  his  pet
    name.  He denied that the cake picture had been taken to make  it  look
    like a genuine relationship. No witnesses had come to the  Tribunal  to
    confirm their relationship was genuine, although he did have a  friend.
    He had not asked a friend to come as he had  not  been  told  this  was
    needed by  the  Tribunal.  The  appellant  was  interested  in  African
    cooking. She also did a bit of sport. She does not drink alcohol.  They
    had celebrated her birthday on 12th October. A male cousin of his  wife
    and friends had come around. The cousin was called  Jahlove.  His  wife
    gets on well with Jahlove, who is about 46 years old. He did  not  know
    Jahlove's status in the UK. He had given his wife �50 for her birthday.
    He did not know what she had done with the money. He did not  know  her
    favourite perfume, and did not buy women perfume. He did not know about
    the appellant's friends in the UK but there were some at  the  birthday
    party.

16. He and the appellant had not really  celebrated  Christmas.  He  was  a
    Catholic by upbringing. He thought, but was not sure, that his wife was
    probably a Catholic too. She goes to church  but  only  rarely  but  he
    could not be more precise about  how  often  he  meant.  They  had  not
    married legally in the UK as he believed they could not do this.

17. The appellant had her parents in Nigeria. She had family in Ghana. They
    had got married in proxy as this was the appellant's idea, and his also
    because they could not go to the Netherlands to marry or marry  in  the
    UK. They had not made enquiries at a registry office in the UK however.
    The appellant's mother had got the papers for  the  Ghanaian  marriage.
    Her parents were living in Ghana.

18. The appellant had not given him money to come  to  the  Tribunal:  they
    both had Oyster cards. He was being truthful that he was in  a  genuine
    relationship with the appellant.

Submissions

19. Mr Melvin submitted that he relied upon the refusal  letter  dated  5th
    October 2013. In summary this document says as follows. It incorporates
    the entire marriage interview (conducted with the Spanish interpreter),
    and high-lights with shading the responses said to be inconsistent.

20. It was not credible that they would marry in  Ghana  as  neither  is  a
    Ghanaian national.

21. It is noted that the appellant and Mr Hoyer were unable to  recall  any
    important memorable events in their life together as husband and  wife.
    They could not name each other's friends and could not answer how  they
    spent birthdays together. They could not say what they had done the day
    before the interview or in  the  days  before  the  interview.  It  was
    contended that photographs provided are  "staged"  and  noted  that  Mr
    Hoyer said pictures of the appellant's  sister  Gloria  were  a  friend
    called "mammy". Mr Hoyer said a man in the pictures was a friend of his
    called Paou, whereas the appellant said he was a friend of  her  sister
    Gloria from Nigeria.

22. Mr Hoyer did not know about previous applications for a residence  card
    or that he was married to the appellant in a country other than the UK.
    He did not know the appellant's nationality or where she was  born.  It
    was not believed that Mr Hoyer lived with the appellant as he  did  not
    know the train station used to travel to the interview  and  could  not
    name the road/area of the Asda in which the appellant and he claimed to
    have met. He did not know how much rent was paid for the flat,  or  how
    or when he moved his belongings into the flat.

23. The appellant did not know about a large scar in an  intimate  area  of
    his body that Mr Hoyer claimed to have. She also did not know the  name
    of the company or gym he works for.

24. It was contended that the appellant and  Mr  Hoyer  had  rehearsed  the
    answers to questions and gave these rather than  answer  the  questions
    put to them, for instance the appellant gave the bus  number  which  Mr
    Hoyer used to go to work rather than giving the name of  the  gym  when
    asked that question.

25. Mr Melvin pointed to further  discrepancies  in  the  evidence  at  the
    Tribunal. The appellant said the relationship began in 2010 where as Mr
    Hoyer said 2011. The appellant had said at interview that Mr Hoyer  had
    lived there before she moved in but before the Tribunal  Mr  Hoyer  had
    said the opposite.  The appellant and sponsor were also very  vague  in
    their evidence: Mr Hoyer did not know full names  for  the  appellant's
    cousin or his status in  the  UK;  Mr  Hoyer  did  not  know  what  the
    appellant bought with her birthday money; Mr Hoyer  did  not  know  the
    appellant's religion or how often she went to church.

26. In addition there was no witness evidence despite their being  said  to
    be friends of the couple and a cousin of the appellant in the UK.

27. There was very little evidence which showed that the  couple  lived  at
    the same address. The only joint correspondence was a  telephone  bill.
    There was no tenancy agreement. The photographs of the  cake  were  not
    good evidence as it was not convincing that the  cake  had  Mr  Hoyer's
    surname and initials on it rather than his pet name.

28. This was a relationship claimed simply to obtain an EU  residence  card
    for the appellant and the appeal should be dismissed.

29. Mr Osifeso made oral submission and relied upon his skeleton  argument.
    He submitted that the appellant and Mr Hoyer were lawfully  married  by
    the proxy marriage in English law. The  marriage  simply  was  not  one
    which could afford the appellant  an  EU  residence  card  due  to  the
    decision of the Tribunal in Kareem (Proxy marriages - EU law).  It  was
    however significant in considering whether the couple were in a durable
    relationship to consider that they were married. The couple were  clear
    on the date they started to cohabit  in  October  2011  and  knew  each
    other's dates of birth. The interview responses of Mr Hoyer are not  to
    be relied upon because of problems with the  Spanish  interpreter,  and
    generally weight should not be given to the interview as the  appellant
    and Mr Hoyer were nervous. There was evidence to show  they  cohabited:
    BT bills, bank statements and Mr Hoyer's payslips. Mr Osifeso submitted
    that there were no serious or material contradictions in the evidence.

30. I pointed out that there were a lot of contradictions in  the  evidence
    of the appellant and  Mr  Hoyer:  some  of  which  had  been  correctly
    identified by Mr Melvin, and that I would  have  to  consider  this  in
    making my decision. I did this so Mr Osifeso was aware that this  would
    be my starting point and so he could make further submissions if he  so
    wished. He asked that I consider the case of Papajorgji (EEA  spouse  -
    marriage of convenience) Greece [2012] UKUT 00038.

31. At the end of the hearing I reserved my determination.

Conclusions

32. The only question in this appeal is whether the appellant qualifies for
    consideration as to whether an EEA residence permit should be issued to
    her by the respondent as a durable partner under Regulation 8(5) of the
    EEA Regulations. There is no human rights appeal in this case,  and  no
    submissions have been made under Article 8 ECHR by  either  party.  The
    Secretary of State argues that the  appellant  is  not  entitled  to  a
    residence card as her supposed durable relationship is in fact  one  of
    convenience, and a sham. The appellant has  conceded  that  she  cannot
    succeed in relation to her original contention that she was entitled to
    a residence  permit  as  a  spouse  under  Regulation  12  of  the  EEA
    Regulations.

33. I am satisfied that Mr Hoyer is a Dutch national as I have seen a  copy
    of his passport and this is not contested by the respondent. I am  also
    satisfied that he is a qualified person exercising Treaty rights in the
    UK as a worker as I have seen extensive evidence of  his  work  in  the
    form of employer's letters, payslips, bank statements showing  payments
    in of salary and a letter from HMRC.

34. It is for the appellant to show on the balance  of  probabilities  that
    she is in a durable relationship with Mr Hoyer. However I  accept  that
    she only need show her relationship is not one of  convenience  if  the
    respondent raises evidence to support this  allegation,  in  accordance
    with the Tribunal decision in Papajorgji. It is clear in this case that
    the respondent does contend that the appellant's relationship is a sham
    on the basis of the lack of evidence to support it and the inconsistent
    answers at interview and before the Tribunal. It is therefore  for  the
    appellant to respond to this evidence which I find meets the  test  set
    out in Papajorgji justifying reasonable suspicion  that  the  marriage/
    relationship was entered into predominantly to secure residence rights.
    I have considered the  evidence  as  a  whole  to  assess  whether  the
    appellant has shown she has, on the balance of probabilities, a durable
    relationship with Mr Hoyer and whether the evidence as  a  whole  shows
    that the relationship is one of convenience.

35. I will not place any weight on answers given by Mr Hoyer  at  interview
    through a Spanish interpreter as these could be  confused  due  to  his
    having insufficient ability in the Spanish language to answer questions
    reliably. It was quite clear he was not sufficiently fluent in  Spanish
    to give evidence before the Tribunal, whereas he was fully able  to  do
    so in Dutch. I appreciate that the appellant may have been  nervous  at
    interview but I do not find this a reason why she would not  have  been
    able to give correct answers at interview or if there were  errors  for
    this reason that these would not have been  specifically  corrected  in
    her witness statement. As such I take note of the answers she  gave  at
    interview none of which were specifically  said  to  be  wrong  in  her
    witness statement.

36. I do not find the appellant has shown on the balance  of  probabilities
    that she is in a durable relationship with Mr Hoyer. This  is  for  the
    following reasons.

37. The appellant and sponsor have  failed  to  provide  detailed  coherent
    statements or oral evidence setting out  their  relationship  from  its
    start to the current day.

38.  The  evidence  the  appellant  and  sponsor  have  given  is  full  of
    significant inconsistencies. Some examples are  as  follows.  There  is
    doubt as to whether the relationship started in 2010 (evidence  of  the
    appellant) or 2011 (evidence of Mr Hoyer). The appellant was not  aware
    that Mr Hoyer had travelled back to Holland to see his children in June
    2014 (his evidence to the Tribunal): she stated at  interview  that  he
    had never been back there since 2010. The appellant and Mr  Hoyer  gave
    contradictory evidence about the address they both say they have  lived
    at since 2011. The appellant said at interview that Mr Hoyer had  lived
    there and she had moved in when they started  to  cohabit,  whereas  Mr
    Hoyer said in his evidence to the Tribunal that he knew  nothing  about
    the landlord and tenancy agreement as  the  appellant  had  made  these
    arrangements as she had lived  there  before  he  moved  in  when  they
    started to cohabit. The appellant said Mr Hoyer does not  have  friends
    at the interview, but then claimed he  had  one  called  Danny  in  her
    evidence before the Tribunal. Before the Tribunal  the  appellant  said
    their flat had three bedrooms and a sitting room whereas Mr Hoyer  said
    it had one bedroom and a sitting room. The appellant said  in  evidence
    to the Tribunal she had no relatives in the UK and none who had visited
    her from abroad bar her sister Gloria, where as Mr Hoyer said she had a
    male cousin in the UK called Jahlove.

39. Mr Melvin also correctly submits that Mr  Hoyer  did  not  know  things
    about the appellant which might be expected of a couple in an  intimate
    relationship which Mr Hoyer has  described  in  glowing  terms  in  his
    witness statement. He did not know what his wife had spent her birthday
    money on and more importantly he  was  very  uncertain  of  his  wife's
    religious faith despite the fact that he said she attended church  from
    time to time and being able to say he was a Catholic by upbringing.

40. The appellant and Mr Hoyer have produced a few photographs  to  support
    their claim to be in a durable relationship. There are  photographs  of
    Mr Hoyer's birthday in August 2014. Mr Melvin rightly points out it  is
    unusual to put initials and a surname on a birthday cake when Mr  Hoyer
    claims in evidence to the Tribunal that the appellant calls  him  by  a
    pet name. In evidence to the Tribunal in  October  2014  (thus  only  a
    couple of months after the event) the appellant said that the event did
    not take place exactly on  Mr  Hoyer's  birthday  but  instead  on  the
    Saturday afterwards, however the  photographs  of  the  event  are  all
    clearly marked with the date as 7th August 2014 which was  a  Thursday.
    There are a few other photographs of the  appellant  and  Mr  Hoyer  in
    central London on 5th October 2012; in a canteen on 6th  November  2011
    and of them on 3rd March 2011 in what looks like a backyard,  a  street
    and a sitting room. There are  notably  none  of  the  celebration  the
    appellant claims took place after the proxy marriage.

41. As Mr Melvin has submitted there is absolutely no family endorsement of
    the relationship and no statements or letters  from  friends.  This  is
    despite both parties naming friends in the UK  and  friends  apparently
    featuring in the photographs; and  the  appellant  having  one  or  two
    relatives who have been in the UK, and it being said that her relatives
    arranged the proxy wedding in Ghana. There are no  photographs  of  the
    proxy wedding or detailed affidavits. I also note that the witnesses on
    the marriage certificate are not the same as the names of  the  fathers
    and mothers on the statutory declaration. There are no letters from the
    mothers and fathers or of these witnesses despite the  fact  that  they
    are said to have carried out this  proxy  marriage  and  thus  to  have
    heavily endorsed the relationship. There was no coherent explanation as
    to why the appellant and Mr Hoyer married by proxy in Ghana rather than
    Nigeria: it was said  it  was  her  "second  home"  but  this  was  not
    explained further.

42. The documentary evidence of cohabitation is also very sparse. There  is
    a letter from Mr Hoyer's employer Enterprise Services -  Fitness  First
    dated 9th May 2012 giving Ethnard Road as his  address  but  it  states
    that the writer has no personal knowledge of Mr Hoyer as she  is  in  a
    payroll processing department; one of his payslips  from  this  company
    has been copied on the reverse showing this  address  too.  He  is  now
    employed by Compass Services UK Ltd and it is clear that they use  this
    address as there are payslips and HMRC documents to  Ethnard  Road  for
    2014. Mr Hoyer's Lloyds TSB bank statements  for  the  period  November
    2011 to August 2013 are also addressed to Ethnard  Road.  He  also  has
    provided a TSB statements from November 2013  to  April  2014  to  this
    address.  The  appellant's  Nationwide  FlexAccount   statements   from
    February 2012 to August 2013 are also addressed to Ethnard Road.  There
    are joint BT bills from December  2011  to  July  2014.  None  of  this
    evidence shows anything more that it is possible that they both live at
    Ethnard Road, which is by all accounts a flat with at least  two  rooms
    which could be used as bedrooms; and by  the  appellant's  account  one
    which  is  a  multi-occupancy  dwelling.  There  is  no  joint  tenancy
    agreement or any evidence that  there  is  shared  financial  or  other
    personal commitments.

43. On  the  basis  of  the  sparse  account  of  their  relationship;  the
    contradictions in their evidence; the lack of  knowledge  by  Mr  Hoyer
    regarding the appellant; and the lack of any significant  corroboration
    of their relationship through other evidence I find that the  appellant
    and Mr Hoyer cannot be considered credible  witnesses  in  relation  to
    their claimed durable relationship.

44. Having considered all of the evidence  I  am  not  satisfied  that  the
    appellant and Mr Hoyer are in the genuine  intimate  relationship  they
    claim. I do not find that they have a durable relationship or that they
    have cohabited as a couple since 2011 as they have claimed. I find that
    the evidence as a whole indicates  that  the  relationship  is  one  of
    convenience. Thus the appellant has not therefore shown  that  she  can
    satisfy Regulation 8(5) of the EEA Regulations.

Decision

      1. The First-tier Tribunal erred in law.


      2. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.

Annex A:

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

    1. Although this is an appeal by the Secretary of State I will refer to
       the parties as they were before the First- tier Tribunal.

    2. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born on 12th October 1972. She
       applied for a residence card on 15th May 2012 as the  spouse  of  Mr
       Fritzgerald Alberto Hoyer, a citizen of the Netherlands born on  7th
       August 1970 who is said to be exercising Treaty rights  in  the  UK.
       The couple had had a Ghanaian customary marriage by  proxy  on  21st
       October 2011. The application was refused on 8th October  2012.  Her
       appeal against the decision was allowed by First-tier Tribunal Judge
       Handley in a determination promulgated on the 19th May 2014.

    3. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal
       Haynes on 2nd July 2014  on the basis that it was arguable that  the
       First-tier judge had erred in law in failing to apply Kareem  (Proxy
       marriages - EU law) [2014] UKUT 00024.

    4. The matter came  before  me  to  determine  whether  the  First-tier
       Tribunal had erred in law.

Submissions

    5. Mr Duffy relied upon the grounds of  appeal.  He  also  argued  that
       Judge Handley had erred in law because he had referred to the  wrong
       reasons for refusal letter. Whilst the appellant had been refused on
       8th October 2012 another reasons for refusal letter had been issued,
       following the interview with the appellant  and  Mr  Hoyer,  on  5th
       October 2013. This essentially refused the appellant on grounds that
       her marriage was also one of convenience as well  as  being  legally
       invalid.

    6. Mr Osifeso accepted that Judge Handley had erred in law  as  he  had
       not assessed the validity of the appellant's marriage with Mr  Hoyer
       under Dutch law in accordance with Kareem and  also  the  subsequent
       case of TA and Others (Kareem explained) [2014] UKUT 316. He had not
       seen the reasons for refusal letter dated 5th October 2013 however.

Conclusions

    7. The First-tier Tribunal had erred in law in failing to be guided  by
       Kareem in the determination of this appeal.

    8. There was no evidence in the Tribunal file that the  refusal  letter
       of 5th October 2013  had  been  provided  to  the  Tribunal  or  the
       appellant prior to the Upper Tribunal hearing on 22nd August 2014 so
       it could not be said that the First-tier Tribunal had erred  in  law
       in failing to refer to this document.

    9. Judge Handley states that the responses  of  the  appellant  and  Mr
       Hoyer to the questions at the marriage interview, as set out in  the
       interview record form, were broadly consistent at  paragraph  13  of
       his determination. However this evidence cannot  properly  be  dealt
       with so briefly:  there  are  some  consistent  answers  but  others
       regarding fundamental matters which on the face of the record do not
       appear reconcilable.

   10. In the circumstances of the appeal not  having  been  determined  in
       accordance with the legal guidance provided by  the  Upper  Tribunal
       with respect to proxy marriages and with factual issues arising from
       the marriage interview having  been  determined  without  sufficient
       reasons I find it appropriate to  set  the  determination  of  Judge
       Handley aside with no findings preserved.

   11. Given the lack of evidence that the refusal letter  of  5th  October
       2013 had been served on the appellant prior to the  hearing  in  the
       Upper Tribunal, and the fact that the appellant and her husband were
       not in attendance, I found it appropriate to adjourn  the  re-making
       hearing, particularly as Mr Osifeso requested this and Mr Duffy  had
       not objection to this course. Both parties were happy for the appeal
       to be re-made in the Upper Tribunal.

 Decision

   12. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the  making  of  an
       error on a point of law.

   13. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.

   14. The re-making hearing is adjourned to Friday 10th  October  2014  at
       2pm

Directions

1. A hearing of 2 hours is required.

2. A Spanish interpreter is required.

3. The appellant is to file with the Tribunal and serve on the respondent  a
bundle of documents for this hearing by 3rd October 2014. This bundle is  to
include statements by the appellant and her husband responding to  the  most
recent refusal letter from the respondent dated 5th October  2013;  material
concerning the validity of their marriage in Dutch law; and any  documentary
evidence the appellant wishes to rely upon to show cohabitation/  a  durable
relationship with her husband.

4. Both the appellant and her husband, Mr Hoyer, are to attend the  Tribunal
hearing on Friday 10th October 2014 to give oral evidence.
