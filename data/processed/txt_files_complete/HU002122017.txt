For the Appellant:     Mr J Bryce, Advocate, instructed by Gray & Co,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr A Govan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. This is an appeal against a decision by Judge of the First-tier
      Tribunal McGavin dismissing an appeal on human rights grounds.

   2. The appellant is a national of Cameroon.  He applied for entry
      clearance as the partner of a refugee and the father of her three
      children.  The Judge of the First-tier Tribunal found there was no
      credible evidence of the appellant having lived with members of the
      family in Cameroon or of contact with them after they came to the UK.
      The refusal of entry clearance was not disproportionate.

   3. Permission to appeal was granted on the grounds that the Judge of the
      First-tier Tribunal had arguably not given adequate reasons and had
      arguably erred in her approach to the traditional marriage entered
      into by the appellant and his partner in Cameroon.

Error of law
   4. Mr Bryce addressed me on the question of whether the Judge of the
      First-tier Tribunal erred in law.  I am grateful to Mr Bryce for his
      written submission, on which he relied.  Mr Bryce pointed out that
      although the Tribunal's jurisdiction was restricted to considering
      whether there was a breach of the Human Rights Act, in accordance with
      Mostafa (Article 8 in entry clearance) [2015] UKUT 00112 the Tribunal
      should look at the Immigration Rules before Article 8.  Mr Bryce
      referred to paragraph 352A of the Immigration Rules, which provides
      for family reunion by a person who currently has refugee status.  He
      pointed out that the appellant's partner, having been a refugee,
      became a naturalised British citizen on 30th October 2018.  She was
      not a British citizen at the time of the application or the
      respondent's refusal decision.

   5. Mr Bryce than pointed out that the respondent's decision was dated
      25th November 2016, which was the day after a Statement of Changes to
      the Immigration Rules, HC667, amended paragraph 352A on spouses of
      refugees by combining it with the provisions for partners of refugees
      previously contained in paragraph 352AA.

   6. Mr Bryce submitted that the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal did not
      give adequate reasons for her decision, particularly when considering
      whether the appellant was a family member of the sponsor.  It was
      accepted by the respondent that the couple had three children
      together.  There were letters from the children showing contact with
      their father but the judge stated at paragraph 30 she would not attach
      any weight to these letters.  The judge made this finding after she
      had already found at paragraph 26 that the appellant did not form part
      of the sponsor's family unit before her flight from Cameroon.  The
      children were born over a four and a half year period, in 1998, 2000
      and 2002.  It was difficult to see how the appeal could have been
      refused if properly reasoned.

   7. Mr Govan agreed that the changes to paragraph 352A were made the day
      prior to the respondent's decision.  This meant that the appellant had
      either to show the existence of a valid marriage or a relationship
      akin to marriage which had subsisted for two years.  The refusal
      decision did not accept the existence of a marriage but there were the
      three birth certificates for the children.  There was an unexplained
      delay by the appellant in seeking entry clearance and no evidence of
      contact in this period except in the form of untranslated messages.
      The judge did not find the sponsor's evidence credible and was
      entitled to reach the conclusions she did.

   8. I indicated that I had serious concerns about the decision of the
      Judge of the First-tier Tribunal.  There was no clear or coherent
      structure to her reasoning.  She had not asked the right questions as
      to the requirements of paragraph 252A which had to be met, and as a
      result of failing to identify the correct issues the judge reached a
      decision which was not supported by adequate reasons.  The judge did
      not ask whether the appellant and the sponsor had been living together
      in Cameroon for two years or more in a relationship akin to marriage.
      The judge did not ask, if there was such a relationship, whether it
      was subsisting and what the intentions of the couple towards each
      other were.  The judge paid scant regard to the couple having had
      three children together over the course of more than four years, which
      was evidence from which the existence of a relationship akin to
      marriage might have been inferred.  The judge did not appear to
      appreciate the relevance of this evidence to the questions she should
      have been addressing.  I was satisfied that the Judge of the First-
      tier Tribunal had erred in law by failing to give adequate reasons.
      Her decision would be set aside and re-made.

   9. Mr Bryce drew to my attention an application under rule 15(2A) to
      admit further evidence.  This comprised a letter dated 1st August 2012
      from Gray & Co and an affidavit of the same date by the sponsor,
      which, Mr Bryce contended, provided a complete answer to the question
      of why the appellant did not apply for entry clearance earlier, as
      well as supporting the pre-flight relationship.

  10. I allowed this further evidence to be admitted.  I informed the
      parties that I intended to re-make the decision and adjourned the
      hearing until the afternoon.  This would provide an opportunity for
      submissions on behalf of the parties and, if so advised, the sponsor
      might tender herself for cross-examination.

Evidence
  11. The hearing was resumed in the afternoon.  The sponsor appeared as a
      witness.  She adopted her witness statement dated 12th December 2017.
      In response to a question from Mr Bryce she said she had started
      living with the appellant a year after her first child was born in
      early August 1998.  They had continued to live together until the
      sponsor left Cameroon in 2011.  Their household consisted of the
      appellant and sponsor, their three children, the sponsor's mother, the
      sponsor's sister, now deceased, and the sister's daughter.

  12. The sponsor said that since arriving in the UK in 2012 she had kept in
      touch with her family.  She obtained a phone within a few days of
      being housed at the YMCA.  It was much cheaper for the appellant to
      phone her from a cyber cafï¿½ in Cameroon.  They used Skype.  More
      recently her oldest child had worked part time in a cafe and used her
      earnings to buy he father a smart phone.  This was taken out to
      Cameroon about two and a half years ago by someone the appellant knew.
       The appellant and sponsor now communicate by WhatsApp.

  13. The sponsor was asked about the appellant's delay in seeking entry
      clearance.  He said he did not have a passport.  Later he explained he
      had said this so as not to worry her.  Her mother could not travel.
      She could not walk and needed the sponsor's niece to help her.  When
      the niece was approaching 18 the appellant told her to get a passport
      and go to the UK.  The appellant found a girl of he same age to help
      with the sponsor's mother.  The sponsor said her mother is now able to
      walk with a stick and has a girl called Victoria who is paid to help
      look after her.  This allows the appellant to come to the UK.

  14. The sponsor was cross-examined by Mr Govan.  She answered questions
      from him about where her partner had been living.  Mr Govan asked why
      the printout of WhatsApp messages lodged in evidence had not been
      translated.  The sponsor said she had been asked to provide these
      messages.  They were in French and she had not thought about having
      them translated.  Mr Govan asked the sponsor if she had anything to
      show she and the appellant had lived together.  The sponsor replied
      that the children were growing up and they knew who they had lived
      with.  They had lost everything in their home in Cameroon and she
      still had no knowledge of the whereabouts of her older brother.

  15. The sponsor was asked about her mother's condition.  The sponsor said
      her mother had had a heart attack.  When the sponsor was kidnapped the
      people came to the house.  They kicked the sponsor's mother and took
      the sponsor out of the house.  The sponsor's partner told her that her
      mother could not walk because her knee was injured in this attack.
      The sponsor said the people carried on hitting her mother after they
      took her out of the house.  She asked them not to hit her mother.

  16. Mr Govan referred to medical evidence stating that the sponsor's
      mother had a deep vein thrombosis.  No reference was made to an injury
      or a heart attack.  It was pointed out that there was no evidence on
      the possible causes of a deep vein thrombosis.

  17. Mr Govan turned to the question of whether the sponsor's relationship
      with the appellant was continuing.  The sponsor pointed out again that
      it was mainly her partner who called her.   From Cameroon he could
      spend all day on the phone to her for the equivalent of ï¿½1.

  18. The sponsor was asked about the marriage contract she had produced.
      She was asked why it was handwritten.  The sponsor explained that this
      was normal for traditional marriages.  The sponsor was asked whose
      idea it was for the children to write letters about their contact with
      their father.  The sponsor said it was her idea.  She asked the
      children to write in English, not French.  This was to provide
      evidence of having lived together.  They lost all their property when
      the sponsor was kidnapped.

  19. Mr Govan asked the sponsor if she had wanted the children to write
      letters as evidence and not because they were in regular contact with
      their father.  The sponsor replied that the children miss their
      father.  Her eldest had called her at the hearing centre today to ask
      what was happening.  When they misbehaved her children told her that
      if their father was here he would understand.  Even her niece had
      never known any other father.

Submissions
  20. In his submission Mr Govan relied on the respondent's refusal letter.
      Some clear issues about the evidence had been raised by the ECO.
      There were specific requirements in paragraph 352A, looked at through
      the prism of the Rules, in accordance with Mostafa.  It was not
      disputed that the appellant was named as the children's father on
      their birth certificates but there were still the questions of whether
      the appellant and the sponsor had been living together and whether
      their relationship was subsisting.  There was a lack of evidence to
      support the assertions in the witness statement.

  21. For the appellant Mr Bryce pointed out that the sponsor had arrived in
      the UK on 27th January 2012 and was granted asylum on 24th February
      2012.  There was no appeal and therefore no copy of the asylum
      interview had been produced.  In her witness statement the sponsor
      said she had given her partner's name at her substantive asylum
      interview.  The respondent had not produced the interview record to
      refute this claim.  The account the sponsor gave in her asylum claim
      had been accepted as reliable and true.  Her house had been broken up
      so there was no paperwork.  The appellant had run away.  Mr Bryce
      pointed out that the appellant and the sponsor had had three children
      together in the course of four and a half years.  The paternity of the
      children was not disputed.  There were letters from the children as
      evidence of an ongoing relationship.  The sponsor's evidence was
      compelling.

  22. Mr Bryce turned to the newly produced evidence in the form of a letter
      and affidavit.  This showed the existence of a relationship both pre-
      flight and subsisting.  The sponsor had explained why there were no
      phone bills.  She needed the appellant with her to look after their
      teenagers.  She intended to live permanently with the appellant.  The
      appellant should have been given entry clearance under the Rules.  In
      terms of Mostafa, where there was compliance with the Rules it would
      be disproportionate to interfere with the appellant's right to private
      and family life.  The appeal should be allowed.

Discussion
  23. The credibility of the appellant's and sponsor's evidence is in
      dispute.  In the refusal decision of 25th November 2016 the respondent
      contended that the sponsor did not mention the existence of her
      partner at her screening interview.  However, it is stated in the
      sponsor's witness statement that the sponsor did refer to the
      appellant at her subsequent asylum interview.  Mr Bryce pointed out
      that a copy of the interview record had not been produced by the
      respondent to refute this claim.  The sponsor further stated that she
      was asked at her screening interview if she was married but not the
      name of her partner.  She explained at her screening interview that
      her marriage was a traditional one and was told by the interviewing
      officer that it was only a legal marriage which would be recognised.
      The interviewing officer treated has as unmarried.

  24. I accept the sponsor's explanation of why her relationship with her
      partner was not recorded at her screening interview.  I accept also
      that she referred to her partner at her asylum interview.  Her
      credibility is not damaged by her relationship with her partner not
      having been included in the record of the screening interview.  I note
      in addition that in the sponsor's affidavit of 1st August 2012 she
      referred to her relationship with her partner.

  25. It was accepted by the respondent that the appellant was named on the
      three birth certificates of the couple's children.  The respondent
      considered, however, that there was no satisfactory explanation of why
      the appellant did not apply for entry clearance at the same time as
      the children.

  26. It was acknowledged that the sponsor's explanation for her partner not
      applying for entry clearance when the children did has changed.  The
      sponsor originally said it was because her partner did not have a
      passport.  It transpired that her partner was concealing from the
      appellant the poor state of her mother's health and her mother's need
      for care, particularly in relation to her mobility.  The appellant and
      the sponsor's niece were caring for the sponsor's mother and could not
      leave her.  When the niece was approaching 18 an application for entry
      clearance was made for her.  The appellant then employed a girl to
      help care for the sponsor's mother.  The mother is now better able to
      walk and the appellant is able to leave her in the care of her
      employed carer.

  27. I can understand that the appellant was reluctant to reveal to the
      sponsor the full extent of her mother's disability.  The sponsor was
      unable to assist her mother and the appellant felt it was his duty to
      stay and care for the mother until further arrangements could be made.
       I accept that this explains why the appellant did not apply for entry
      clearance at an earlier stage.

  28. The remaining credibility issue raised in the refusal decision related
      to continuing contact between the appellant and the sponsor.
      According to the respondent there was no satisfactory evidence of
      this.  Phone cards were produced but these were considered to be of
      limited evidential value.

  29. In her evidence before me the sponsor explained that the appellant
      used to telephone her from a cyber cafï¿½ in Cameroon because this was
      considerably cheaper that the sponsor telephoning from the UK.  Later
      the appellant was given a smart phone and the couple were able to
      communicate by WhatsApp.  Numerous printed sheets of WhatsApp messages
      were lodged but, as Mr Govan pointed out, these had not been
      translated from French into English.  When the sponsor was asked about
      this in cross-examination she indicated she did not know these should
      have been translated.  In this matter the sponsor was entitled to rely
      upon her representatives.  I do not consider that any blame should be
      attached to the representatives in this regard.  There may be various
      reasons why a document is not translated.  There may be issues of time
      or expense, particularly where the evidence is as voluminous as it is
      here.  It may be that the existence of the document is of more
      importance than the content.

  30. In relation to the WhatsApp messages I take the view that it is their
      existence which matters rather than their detailed content.  This is
      not a case where it seems probable that the couple have never been in
      a genuine relationship.  They have three children together.  The
      couple have to show their relationship is continuing and even in their
      untranslated state the WhatsApp messages constitute relevant evidence
      directed towards this end.

  31. At the hearing Mr Govan raised the issue of whether the children had
      been directed to write letters about their relationship with their
      father.  The sponsor admitted that she had told the children to write
      these letters.  She added that she had done this so the children would
      know to write the letters in English rather than French, which was the
      language in which they would normally communicate with their father.

  32. I do not consider it at all surprising that the children would need
      some encouragement or supervision to write letters to be produced as
      evidence, particularly when the letters had to be in a different
      language from the one which they would normally use with their father.
       I do not think the letters lose their evidential value because the
      sponsor initiated the writing of them.

  33. A further issue which was raised at the hearing was why the appellant
      and the sponsor had so little documentary evidence of their life
      together in Cameroon.  The sponsor explained that when men arrived at
      their home and she was kidnapped the house was broken up and documents
      were lost or destroyed.  Given that the sponsor then fled from
      Cameroon and was granted refugee status in the UK I see no reason not
      to accept this explanation.

  34. The sponsor gave her oral testimony in a direct and straightforward
      manner.  Mr Bryce rightly cautioned me against assessing credibility
      on the basis of demeanour.  He pointed out, however, that the
      sponsor's asylum claim had been accepted by the respondent and she had
      been granted refugee status about a month only after her arrival in
      the UK.  The sponsor is not someone who has been found previously to
      lack credibility.

  35. The sponsor gave evidence before me.  Her evidence is supported by
      such documents as are available, principally in the form of her
      children's birth certificates, the sponsor's affidavit of 1st August
      2012, her children's letters, and the WhatsApp messages.  I have
      considered the issues raised on behalf of the respondent for
      questioning the credibility of parts of the evidence.  I accept that
      satisfactory explanations have been given in respect of these matters.
       Accordingly I accept the appellant and sponsor's evidence with regard
      to their relationship as credible.

  36. In order to satisfy the relevant provisions of paragraph 352A the
      Immigration Rules the appellant needs to show that he and the sponsor
      were in a relationship akin to marriage which subsisted for at least
      two years before the sponsor left Cameroon.  The appellant no longer
      seeks to show that his traditional marriage to the sponsor should be
      recognised as valid in law and doe not need to do so if the couple can
      satisfy the requirements to show the existence of an unmarried
      partnership.  In addition the appellant needs to show that the
      relationship is genuine and subsisting and that it is the intention of
      both the sponsor and himself to live together permanently.

  37. The birth certificates of the children go a long way to establishing
      the existence of a relationship akin to marriage.  As the respondent
      points out, children may be conceived without a relationship akin to
      marriage.  In the evidence in this appeal, however, I have not found
      any reason not to accept the couple's evidence that they were in a
      relationship akin to marriage and lived together in Cameroon with
      their children and other family members for at least ten years.

  38. It is the evidence of the sponsor and the children that this
      relationship is continuing.  I have accepted this evidence as
      credible, for the reasons set out above.  It is the intention of the
      couple to resume living together on a permanent basis if entry
      clearance is granted and I have found their evidence credible.

  39. This appeal is made not under the Immigration Rules but under Article
      8.  Looking at the circumstances through the lens of the Immigration
      Rules, where the appellant satisfies the requirements of the Rules it
      is difficult to envisage how the public interest will outweigh the
      interference with the appellant's Article 8 rights arising from the
      refusal of entry clearance.  In terms of Mostafa, it does not
      necessarily follow from the fact that the Immigration Rules are
      satisfied that an appellant should succeed under Article 8.  In this
      appeal, however, there are no other countervailing factors to set
      against the family life of the appellant and sponsor and, most
      importantly, their three children.  It was pointed out that the
      sponsor has recently become a British citizen and therefore is no
      longer a refugee.  However, she was a refugee at the time not only of
      the respondent's decision but also of the decision of the First-tier
      Tribunal.  I am re-making the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and
      giving the decision which that tribunal should have given, which is to
      allow the appeal under Article 8.  The refusal of entry clearance in
      these circumstances constitutes a disproportionate interference with
      the appellant's right to respect for his private and family life.

Conclusions
  40. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the
      making of an error on a point of law.

  41. The decision is set aside.

  42. I re-make the decision by allowing the appeal.


Anonymity
The First-tier Tribunal did not make a direction for anonymity.  I have not
been asked to make such a direction and do not consider such a direction to
be necessary.

Fee award                      (N.B. This is not part of the decision.)
Although the appeal is allowed this is only after the hearing of evidence
and the resolution of factual issues in dispute.  I make no fee award.
