Upper Tribunal
(Immigration and Asylum Chamber)    Appeal Number: EA/06405/2017



                            Sent on 8 March 2018

                               Valdis Piladzis

                                     and

                 Secretary of State for the Home Department


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal  ("FtT")  against  a
    decision of the SSHD, dated 30 June 2017, refusing his application  for
    an EEA Permanent Residence Card.


 2. The FtT  dismissed  the  appeal  on  a  wholly  irrational  basis  and,
    unsurprisingly, the FtT's decision was set aside by  DUTJ  Lewis  in  a
    decision promulgated on 23 February 2018.


 3. The SSHD has since  given  further  consideration  to  the  appellant's
    application and, by way of an e-mail of 5 March 2018 sent to the  Upper
    Tribunal, accepts that the appellant has acquired  permanent  residence
    in the UK and is entitled to a Permanent Residence Card  confirming  as
    much. The e-mail further  invited  the  Upper  Tribunal  to  allow  the
    appellant's appeal on such basis, an invitation I accept.


 4. On the basis of the SSHD's concession, I allow the  appellant's  appeal
    against the SSHD's decision of 30 June 2017.




Signed:



Upper Tribunal Judge O'Connor                    7/3/18
