                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The appellant,  a  citizen  of  Afghanistan,  has  appealed  against  a
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal ('FTT') dated 6 November  2017,  in
    which it dismissed an appeal against a decision of the respondent dated
    10 July 2017 refusing to grant her a residence card as a family  member
    of her British citizen spouse ('the  sponsor'),  who  claimed  to  have
    exercised Treaty rights in another EU member state.  The respondent did
    not accept that the couple's  residence  in  Ireland  was  genuine  and
    concluded that it was to artificially create conditions  to  allow  the
    appellant to remain in the UK.



Background facts


 2. The appellant married the sponsor in Afghanistan in 2009.  They have  a
    British citizen child,  born  in  Afghanistan  in  2014.   After  their
    marriage the sponsor remained living in the UK but visited his wife  in
    Pakistan.


 3. The sponsor claims to have relocated to Waterford, Ireland in  December
    2014.  The appellant and their child joined him there on 28 June  2015,
    having obtained an EEA family permit.  They left Ireland in July  2016,
    returning to live together in Preston in the  same  house  the  sponsor
    resided in prior to moving to Ireland.

Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

 4. In grounds of appeal lodged on behalf of the appellant  it  was  argued
    that the FTT included mistaken facts in  the  decision,  which  led  to
    unfairness and failed to take into account relevant evidence, which led
    to conclusions unsupported by the evidence.


 5. In a decision dated 8 August 2018 FTT Judge Adio considered the grounds
    of appeal arguable, observing inter alia, "there is a clear mistake  in
    identity and mistake of facts in some of the evidence in this appeal".


 6. Although the SSHD served a rule 24 notice,  which  submitted  that  the
    reference to  irrelevant  factual  matters  in  the  decision  was  not
    material, Mrs Aboni accepted at the hearing before me  that  the  FTT's
    mistakes, when viewed in the round were material  errors  of  law  such
    that the decision must be set aside and remade by the FTT on a de  novo
    basis.

Discussion


 7. It is important to acknowledge that for the most part the FTT  decision
    is carefully drafted and includes cogent reasons for finding  that  the
    sponsor did not transfer his life to Ireland, before returning  to  the
    UK.  However, as acknowledged by Mrs Aboni the decision  also  contains
    mistakes set out below.


 8. First, at [12] and [13] of the decision, the FTT refers to an  entirely
    separate decision letter and describes parties and their  circumstances
    by name, completely unrelated to  the  instant  appeal.   The  FTT  has
    clearly included these paragraphs in error.  If an isolated  error,  it
    may not be sufficient to cause the decision to be set aside but it must
    be viewed with the other concerns outlined below.

 9. Second, at [23(ii)] the FTT refers to the appellant using  his  Preston
    address when communicating with the respondent in  January  2015.   The
    FTT appears to have made the  innocent  mistake  of  referring  to  the
    sponsor as the appellant.  Of more significance is the FTT's finding in
    the same paragraph that the sponsor's correspondence  relating  to  the
    HMRC was all directed to the Preston  address  suggesting  he  had  not
    transferred the  centre  of  his  life  to  Ireland.   As  Ms  Johnrose
    correctly pointed out in the grounds of appeal and as accepted  by  Mrs
    Aboni, the HMRC correspondence is only dated either 2014 or  2017.   In
    other words, the absence of HMRC correspondence to the Preston  address
    for the time the sponsor was in in Ireland in 2015-16  supports  rather
    than undermines his claim.  This is consistent with  his  self-employed
    accounts for when he was working as a taxi-driver in the UK, which only
    cover the years  ending  2013,  2014  and  2017  and  the  evidence  of
    correspondence with the Irish Revenue office regarding tax  credits  in
    2016 (pgs 57-60).

10. Third, at [23(iii)] the  FTT  rejected  the  sponsor's  claim  that  by
    placing his property for sale at �110,000 he genuinely intended to sell
    it, as it was reduced to �80,000 suggesting an  inflated  price.   This
    finding fails to acknowledge the evidence contained in an email dated 6
    March 2017 (pg 105) from the estate agent  that  refers  to  apparently
    recent discussions that resulted in them "now marketing"  the  property
    at a revised price of �80,000.   The FTT  has  not  engaged  with  this
    evidence or adequately explained why the sale was not genuine when  the
    property continued to be  marketed  for  sale  many  months  after  the
    sponsor's departure from Ireland and return to Preston.

11. It is difficult  to  separate  these  errors  from  the  other  factual
    findings.  After all it is all the factors set out at [23(i) to  (vii)]
    that the FTT took into  account  in  reaching  its  decision.   In  the
    circumstances, Mrs Aboni was  correct  to  concede  that  there  was  a
    material error of law in the FTT decision.

Disposal

12. Both representatives agreed that the decision should be remade  by  the
    FTT.  I have had regard to para 7.2 of the relevant Senior  President's
    Practice Statement and the nature and extent of  the  factual  findings
    required in remaking the decision, and I have decided that this  is  an
    appropriate case to remit to the FTT.

Decision


13. The decision of the FTT involved the making of a material error of law.
     Its decision cannot stand and is set aside.


14. The appeal shall be remade by FTT de novo.
