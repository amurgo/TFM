                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

    1. The appellant is a national of Iran who made a claim for protection
       on the basis he would be at risk if returned because he had changed
       his religious beliefs from Islam to Christianity. His claim was
       refused and his appeal to the First-tier Tribunal was dismissed. He
       then made further representations based upon additional evidence and
       his activities in relation to Christianity in the United Kingdom.
       These related to a progression in his beliefs and his proselytising.
       This was also dismissed. His appeal was heard by Judge of the First-
       tier Tribunal IF Taylor and was also dismissed.

    2. The appellant attended his appeal along with 2 ministers of religion
       and 2 other individuals. He claimed that members of his family were
       supportive of the Iranian regime and to this end he had produced a
       number of photographs said to show his cousin in the company of
       Iranian officials.

    3. First-tier Tribunal IF Taylor applied the Devaseelan principle in
       relation to the earlier First-tier Tribunal decision. The judge said
       no issue had been taken in relation to the appellant having been
       baptised and confirmed or that he was an active member of the church.
       What was not accepted in the original hearing was that his conversion
       was genuine.

    4. First-tier Tribunal Taylor at paragraphs 30 and 14 sets out the
       appellant's explanation of photographs submitted. At paragraph 18 the
       judge commented that 'None of the photographs are in original form'.
       At paragraph 23 the judge sets out a summary of the evidence of the
       witnesses called on behalf of the appellant. At paragraph 29 the
       judge said that none of the photographs were in original form which
       reduced the weight attached to them. Then, at paragraph 34, the judge
       refers to having considered the documents and concluded that none of
       them could be considered reliable.

The Upper Tribunal.

    5. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis it was arguable First-
       tier Tribunal Taylor failed to make any findings on the oral evidence
       by the witnesses called on behalf of the appellant. The grounds had
       also asserted that the judge erred in stating that the photographs
       submitted were not in an original form and therefore less weight was
       placed upon. It was submitted that photographs now are typically
       taken on phones and cameras and then self-printed.

    6. At hearing both representatives were in agreement that the judge
       materially erred in failing to make findings in relation to the
       evidence of the witnesses called on behalf of the appellant.

    7. I would agree that the decision is defective. It records in summary
       form the evidence of the witnesses. However, it does not evaluate the
       content of the evidence. In the case of claimed conversion the
       opinion of church ministers and activists can be very important and
       such persons have on occasion been described as if they were expert
       witnesses. They were fundamental to the appeal and it was necessary
       for the judge to evaluate and set out an assessment of their
       evidence. This is missing and is a material error of law.

    8. The failing to reach conclusions on the evidence of the witnesses
       means the decision is fundamentally flawed and so the question of the
       photographs submitted is therefore secondary. For completeness
       however it is not apparent what the judge meant by `in the original
       form.' If the judge was referring to the fact they were reproduced,
       for instance on a domestic printer rather than commercially, it was
       necessary for the judge not only to explain the probative value of
       the photographs but also why less weight was being attached to them
       because of their format. This was not done.

    9. Primarily because of the lack of evaluation of the oral testimony the
       decision is fundamentally flawed and cannot stand. Consequently I set
       it aside for a fresh de novo hearing.

Decision.

The decision of First-tier Tribunal IF Taylor materially errs in law and is
set aside for a de novo hearing in the First-tier Tribunal

Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge.



Directions.

    1. Relist for a de novo hearing in the First-tier Tribunal at Nottingham
       excluding First-tier Tribunal Judge IF Taylor.
    2. A Farsi interpreter will be required
    3. There may be four witnesses and a hearing estimate of 2 ï¿½ hours is
       reasonable.
    4. When the appellant's representatives are preparing for the fresh
       appeal they should consider the probative value of the photographs
       relied upon. It is suggested that the appellant's cousin can be seen
       in the presence of high-ranking members of the Iranian regime. The
       representative should consider how it can be established that the
       person is in fact the appellant's cousin. It may be for instance
       there are 2 photographs of them together or publish photographs with
       his cousins name which can be linked somehow to the appellant.
    5. There have now been a number of cases in relation to conversions and
       the use of church witnesses which the parties may wish to consider:
         (i)  Dorodian (Ali) v Secretary of State for the Home Department
         (ii) SA (Iran) v Secretary of State for the Home Department
         (Iran) [2012] EWHC 2575
         (iii)    TF and MA v The Secretary of State for the Home Department
         [2018] CSIH 58
