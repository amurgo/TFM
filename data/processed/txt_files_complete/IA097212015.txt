Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr D Sellwood, instructed by Castle Park Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. Both parties to the appeal before the First-tier Tribunal  have  sought
    to challenge the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge C H O'Rourke who
    allowed the appeal by the appellant, a  national  of  Thailand  born  7
    October 1978, against decisions of the  Secretary  of  State  dated  26
    February 2015 refusing to vary her leave to  enter  or  remain  and  to
    remove her from the United Kingdom.  The judge allowed the appeal under
    the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006, although that was not a  ground
    before him nor is it one which Mr Sellwood relies on today.

 2. The background to this case is that the respondent is in a relationship
    with a British  Citizen,  Mr  Huby,  whom  she  has  known  since  2011
    following their meeting in Dubai.  The couple have a child who was born
    in Thailand in 2012.  The couple have  lived  variously  in  Australia,
    Thailand and the United  Kingdom.   They  plan  to  marry  on  Mr  Huby
    divorcing his current wife.

 3. The respondent last entered the United Kingdom with their child  on  20
    July 2014 with leave  valid  until  25  December  2014.   She  made  an
    application on 6 January 2015 on form FLR(M).  This was on the basis of
    her being the unmarried partner of a person present and settled in  the
    United Kingdom and  a  biometric  immigration  document  that  she  had
    submitted.

 4. The Secretary of State refused the application with  reference  to  the
    relevant provisions of Appendix FM, which we do  not  need  to  recite.
    Essentially  she  did  not  accept  that  the  couple  had  been  in  a
    relationship akin to marriage for two or  more  years  and  furthermore
    that the respondent had entered the United Kingdom  as  a  visitor  and
    thus did not qualify by virtue  of  E-LTRP.2.1  of  Appendix  FM.   The
    application  was  also  refused  with  reference   to   the   financial
    requirements.  The respondent contended that Mr Huby earned  ï¿½18,600  a
    year but the Secretary of State was  concerned  about  the  absence  of
    "specified evidence" to support that assertion.

 5. The Secretary of State explained in her decision letter  that  she  had
    considered  the  application  under  Appendix  FM  EX.1  which  enables
    respondent to bypass certain provisions of the eligibility requirements
    under the Rules.  She considered, however, that  these  provisions  did
    not apply because the appellant had entered the  United  Kingdom  as  a
    visitor.  This led the judge  into  error.   In  paragraph  16  of  his
    decision he concluded that because the respondent could not comply with
    E-LTRP.2.1 she could not rely on EX.1 and stated:

         "I do so because it is clear that the Home  Office's  intention  in
         drawing  up  that  Rule  was  to  prevent  visitors  bypassing  the
         requirement to make an out of country entry clearance  application.
         I am not persuaded by the appellant's Counsel's arguments that this
         is a lacuna in the Rules and that the clear deliberate flouting  of
         that Rule by the [Respondent] in overstaying allows  her  to  avoid
         it."

 6. The judge, however, decided to  rescue  the  situation  by  reaching  a
    conclusion under the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006 having directed
    himself in that regard earlier in his  decision  to  the  Secretary  of
    State's own policy, "Appendix FM family life (as a partner  or  parent)
    and private life: ten year routes".  It is not at all clear whether the
    Respondent's representatives were invited to make  submissions  on  the
    regulations.  Such a ground does not appear in the  grounds  of  appeal
    before the judge.  The challenge by the  Secretary  of  State  to  this
    decision is no longer pursued by Mr Walker.  It appears that the  judge
    granting permission to appeal, in response to the Secretary of  State's
    challenge  considered  but  did  not  reach  a   conclusion   on   that
    application.  We express no view except  to  observe  that  it  is  not
    necessarily without merit in the light of the absence of  any  argument
    on this point.

 7. This leaves us with the challenge by Mr Sellwood  on  which  permission
    has been granted.  The challenge is twofold.  The  first  is  that  the
    judge had misdirected himself in law when considering  the  Immigration
    Rules, in particular EX.1.  The  second  is  that  the  judge  did  not
    address Article 8.  It is accepted by Mr Walker that the judge erred on
    the basis of the first ground; Mr Walker was right to do  so.   We  are
    satisfied that the judge misunderstood the Immigration Rules at EX.1 of
    Appendix FM.

 8. Mr Sellwood and Mr Walker have agreed that as  a  consequence  of  that
    error, the decision should be  set  aside  and  the  appeal  should  be
    allowed under the Immigration Rules in the light  of  the  unchallenged
    findings by the judge which  we  have  referred  to  above  and  taking
    account of the Secretary of State's policy which appears  at  paragraph
    15(v) of the decision.  We quote from that policy:

         "11.2.3  Would it be unreasonable to expect a British citizen child
                to leave the United Kingdom?

                Save in cases involving criminality, the decision maker must
                not take a decision in relation to  the  parent  or  primary
                carer of a British citizen child where the  effect  of  that
                decision would be to force that British child to  leave  the
                EU, regardless of the age of that child.  This reflects  the
                European Court of Justice judgment in Zambrano."

 9. We consider Mr Walker was correct to concede the  appeal.   Accordingly
    we set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and we remake  the
    decision allowing the appeal by the  appellant  under  the  Immigration
    Rules.





Signed                                  Date:         14 July 2016
