Officer

Paragraph 281(iv) of HC 395 does not prohibit the provision of
accommodation by a third party.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan. He  appealed  to  the  Tribunal
    against the decision of the respondent Entry Clearance  Officer  on  23
    February 2007, refusing him entry clearance to the  United  Kingdom  as
    the spouse of a person present and settled here.  The Immigration Judge
    allowed the appeal.  The respondent applied for and obtained  an  order
    for reconsideration.  Thus the matter comes before us.

 2. The Immigration Judge's decision was to  the  effect  that  so  far  as
    concerned the contested parts of paragraph  281  of  the  Statement  of
    Changes  in  Immigration  Rules  HC  395,  the  appellant   met   those
    requirements. They were sub-paras (iv) and (v) which read as follows:

           (iv) There will be adequate accommodation for  the  parties  and
           any dependents without recourse to public funds in accommodation
           which they own or occupy exclusively; and
            (v) The parties will be able  to  maintain  themselves  and  any
dependents
            adequately without recourse to public funds.

    The Immigration Judge found as a  fact  that  the  appellant  would  be
    accommodated with his wife in premises where his  wife  lives  already.
    Those are premises owned by a person who, we are told,  is  related  to
    both the appellant and his wife as a cousin of one parent  of  each  of
    them.  The appellant's  wife  has  been  living  there  and  she  makes
    contributions to the household bills, although she pays no  rent.   The
    Immigration Judge was told, and accepted, that the accommodation  would
    continue to be available for the appellant and his wife.

 3. The Immigration Judge also found as a fact that  the  appellant's  wife
    was working in the United Kingdom and that  she  had  an  income  which
    amounted to some �115 after tax, per week, at the date of the decision.
     She had also been able to amass a certain amount  by  way  of  savings
    which was, at the date of the decision, about �6,000.

 4. The Immigration Judge was asked by the Presenting Officer, on behalf of
    the Entry Clearance Officer, to say that under those circumstances  the
    appellant did not meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules.   The
    reason was that, although if one took sub-paragraph (v)  in  isolation,
    the appellant could meet the  maintenance  requirements  of  the  Rules
    because the income of his wife was more than would be  available  to  a
    couple on Income Support, her income was not sufficient to  enable  the
    parties to accommodate themselves if it were  not  the  fact  that  the
    sponsor was so generously providing accommodation for them.

 5. The Immigration Judge was asked to say that the requirements  for  sub-
    paragraphs (iv) and (v) should be taken together, that they  should  be
    taken in the sense adumbrated by the Tribunal in AM [2007] UKAIT 00058,
    and that therefore it was necessary  for  the  appellant  to  show  not
    merely that accommodation was available and that he and his wife  would
    be able maintain  themselves,  but  that  they  would  have  sufficient
    resources to be able to accommodate themselves should the need arise.

 6. The Immigration Judge rejected that argument.  He noted the  difference
    in wording between sub-paragraphs (iv) and (v) and he said:

        "In my judgement there is no justification for importing  into  the
        provisions [of sub-paragraph (iv)], a requirement that an applicant
        and/or a sponsor should in some way  fund  the  accommodation  that
        they occupy.  Subparagraph 281(iv)  requires  that  there  will  be
        adequate accommodation.  In my judgement, an applicant can  satisfy
        this requirement by establishing that he and his spouse  will  live
        with a relative, provided there is a  sufficient  expectation  that
        the  accommodation  will  continue  to  be  available   for   their
        occupation."

    It is for that reason, on the facts that he had found, that he  allowed
    the appeal, although we should indicate  that  he  also  observed  that
    there was no evidence that the appellant  himself  had  access  to  any
    employment.


 7. In the grounds for reconsideration, upon which Mr. Tarlow relies before
    us, the point is put as follows:

        "The Immigration Judge appears to have rejected the argument of the
        Presenting Officer regarding AM, without considering the import  of
        the free accommodation on the sponsor's  ability  to  maintain  the
        appellant.  While it is acknowledged that the sponsor  has  savings
        of six thousand pounds, there is no assessment by  the  Immigration
        Judge as to whether without  the  free  accommodation  the  sponsor
        would be able to maintain the appellant."

 8. Mr. Chaudhary has pointed out that the question before us today affects
    a considerable number of appellants, and it affects  also  the  general
    assumption that in cases of this nature accommodation will commonly  be
    provided by friends or, particularly, relatives  of  the  parties.   He
    reminds us that sub-paragraphs (iv) and (v) of para 281  are  expressed
    differently, and he suggests  that  the  intention  is  different.   He
    suggests that the emphasis  in  para  281(iv)  is  essentially  on  the
    "exclusively" requirement, that is to say that the parties need to have
    property available which they can call their own as home, even if is as
    little as their own bedroom in an otherwise shared house, as  explained
    by the Tribunal in KJ [2008] UKAIT 00006: but that in sub-para (v)  the
    emphasis is on the source of the funds available for maintenance.

 9. Access to accommodation in the United Kingdom is, as is well known,  an
    expensive matter.  Families  with  members  who  are  entirely  British
    citizens frequently find that it is necessary  for  adult  children  to
    continue to live at home until they can afford  to  live  somewhere  by
    themselves.  It is part  of  the  common  experience  of  mankind  that
    children, even adult children, continue to live with their  parents  or
    sometimes other relatives.

10. In one sense, as was pointed out in argument, it might make a  nonsense
    of the rules to say that for the day-to-day maintenance, which may well
    be relatively inexpensive, the parties should provide their own  funds,
    whereas for the most expensive part of their life, that is to say their
    rent and other accommodation costs, they are entitled to  rely  on  the
    beneficence of others.  Another way of looking at that is to  recognise
    that because accommodation is so expensive  as  an  element  in  living
    costs, it is reasonable to expect the parties to pay for  the  rest  of
    the living costs themselves and perhaps rely on  usual  traditions  and
    practice for housing.

11. Two matters appear to us to be important in attempting  to  assess  the
    competing arguments in this appeal.  The first  is  that  the  cost  of
    housing varies enormously around the United Kingdom.  If  parties  were
    required to show that they would have adequate accommodation  available
    to them from their own resources  the  answer  to  an  Entry  Clearance
    application would be different if the parties were thought to be  going
    to attempt to live in central London  from  the  answer  if  they  were
    thought to be going to attempt to live in a part of the  country  where
    housing is much cheaper.  It does not seem to us  that  that  can  have
    been intended. Further, and this is Mr. Chaudhary's point, there is  no
    doubt at all that the wording in sub-para (iv) is different  from  that
    found in sub-para (v).

12. It seems to us that what the rules require  is,  broadly  speaking,  as
    follows.  In order to meet the  maintenance  requirements  the  parties
    need to show that a certain amount of money will be available  to  them
    from their own work or resources.  That certain  amount  of  money  is,
    broadly speaking, what would be available to a similar family on Income
    Support, net of housing costs.

13. So far as accommodation is concerned they need to show that  they  will
    have a home that they will be able to call their own however that  home
    is provided.  The accommodation must be adequate, but the rule does not
    require anything about the source of it.  Both  sub-paragraphs  require
    certain predictions as to the future.  Both therefore require  evidence
    as to the stability of the arrangements proposed.  But we do not  think
    it would be right to import into the requirements of sub-para (iv),  in
    relation to accommodation, a requirement that is absent from that  sub-
    paragraph but is clearly present in sub-para (v).

14. It follows that,  like  the  question  of  availability  of  sufficient
    income, the availability of adequate accommodation is a matter for  the
    facts of the individual case.  The mere mention of an uncle  or  cousin
    who is prepared to accommodate the parties may well not persuade either
    an Entry Clearance Officer or an Immigration Judge.  But an Immigration
    Judge  who  is  persuaded  that  there  is  a  stable  arrangement  for
    accommodation which otherwise meets the requirements for  adequacy  and
    to exclusivity should not, in our view, dismiss an appeal simply on the
    basis that the accommodation is to be provided by another.  If there is
    reason for him to think that the arrangements for accommodation are not
    stable, that of course is an entirely different matter.

15. In the present case  the  Immigration  Judge  was  persuaded  that  the
    accommodation offer was a real and stable one.  It is a continuation of
    the arrangement presently enjoyed  by  the  appellant's  wife  herself.
    There was no doubt in his mind that the offer  by  the  owner  of  that
    accommodation to extend it to the appellant as well was an offer  which
    was both credible and  practical.   The  appellant  therefore  met  the
    requirements of sub-paragraphs (iv) and  (v)  of  Paragraph  281.   The
    Immigration Judge did not err  in  law  in  so  finding  and  we  order
    therefore that his determination shall stand.
