                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge D S Borsada, promulgated on  17th  September  2014,  following  a
    hearing at Birmingham Sheldon Court on  8th  September  2014.   In  the
    determination, the judge dismissed the appeals of Jianchun Chen and her
    daughter Xinyao Chen.  The Appellants  subsequently  applied  for,  and
    were granted, permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal, and thus  the
    matter comes before me.

The Appellants

 2. The Appellants are mother  and  daughter.   The  first  Appellant,  the
    mother, Jianchun Chen,  was  born  on  30th  March  1981.   The  second
    Appellant, the daughter, Xinyao Chen, was born on  19th  October  2001.
    Both are citizens of China.  They appealed against the decision of  the
    Respondent to refuse their application for leave to enter the UK as the
    partner and child respectively of the Sponsor, Yuehua  Gao,  a  British
    citizen, settled in the UK.

The Appellants' Claim

 3. In the refusal letter dated 20th September 2013,  the  applications  of
    both Appellants were initially refused on two grounds.  First, that the
    Sponsor Yuehua Gao, "not show earnings of �22,400 as required  for  the
    preceding year in order to meet the financial requirements  as  defined
    in paragraph E-ECP3.3.  Second, that the issue could not  be  satisfied
    that there was adequate accommodation available for both the Appellants
    without recourse to public funds.  The refusal letter also stated that

         "... no final determination has been  made  at  this  stage  as  to
         whether you meet the income threshold.  This is because of course I
         have not yet decided the outcome of the Secretary of State's appeal
         in a legal challenge to the income threshold requirement ..."

    Following  a  review  by  the  Entry  Clearance  Manager  subsequently,
    however, it was accepted that accommodation was indeed  available,  and
    so the only issue outstanding before the judge in the  appeal  was  the
    financial requirement.

 4. The judge held, however, that, "...  The Sponsor's income  is  probably
    sufficient to meet the  maintenance  requirements  of  the  Rules  ..."
    (paragraph 7), although it appeared that the pay slips provided by  the
    Sponsor, Yuehua Gao, the mother of the second Appellant, and  the  wife
    of the first Appellant, were for July and August  2013  which  predated
    the date of the application.  Although she submitted a P45 this did not
    show how much income was earned.  A P60 from the Sponsor for  the  year
    ending 5th April 2013 showed an income of  only  �15,600.   The  proper
    evidence had not been submitted  and  the  judge  observed  that,  "The
    failure to do so is entirely one of the Appellants' own making and  any
    perceived harshness in the outcome of the  decision  was  entirely  one
    that could have been avoided by them i.e. there is no need to  consider
    the case outside the Rules" (paragraph 7).  Nevertheless, the judge did
    go on to consider Article 8 of the ECHR but held, "It is  not  my  view
    that the appeal can succeed for that reason and this is even  accepting
    that the matter comes down to one of proportionality  in  the  decision
    making (Razgar)" (see paragraph 7).

 5. The appeals were dismissed.

Grounds of Application

 6. The grounds of application are  as  follows.   First,  that  the  judge
    failed to consider that the Sponsor, Yuehua Gao, had a young  daughter,
    namely, the second Appellant, Xinyao Chen, who was  a  minor,  born  on
    19th October 2001, who at the date of the decision by the ECO in  2013,
    was 12 years old.  The reasoning provided at paragraph  7  simply  does
    not deal with the position of the second Appellant,  Xinyao  Chen,  who
    should have been considered under freestanding Article 8 jurisprudence.
     Second, the Sponsor, Yuehua Gao, was eights  months  pregnant  at  the
    time of the decision and has now  given  birth  to  a  British  citizen
    child, and the fact that she was pregnant should have been  taken  into
    account under the principles of Beoku-Betts with respect to the Article
    8 rights of Yuehua Gao, the Sponsor, herself as the British citizen  in
    the United Kingdom.

 7. Second, the  judge  misdirected  himself  because  the  extent  of  the
    Appellants' compliance with the Immigration Rules was relevant  in  the
    assessment of proportionality: see Patel [2013] UKSC 72.

 8. On 19th November 2014, permission to appeal was granted on the  grounds
    that it was arguable that the best interest of the minor Appellant  had
    not been considered by the judge.

 9. On 5th December 2014, a Rule 24 response  was  entered  to  the  effect
    that, as the second child had not yet been born it was not  a  material
    consideration for the judge.  The judge was entitled to conclude as  he
    did in holding that the requirements of the  relevant  Rules  were  not
    met.

Submissions

10. At the hearing before me on 10th April  2015,  Mr  Pipe,  appearing  on
    behalf of the Appellants, relied upon his Grounds  of  Appeal  and  his
    skeleton argument.   He  submitted  that  the  Sponsor  had  earnt  the
    necessary amount of money for  the  financial  requirements  under  the
    Rules and this was accepted by the judge.  Therefore,  the  only  issue
    was in relation to Article 8.  Given that the  accommodation  had  been
    conceded as an issue by the Entry Clearance  Manager,  the  only  issue
    before the judge was in relation to the financial requirement.  Indeed,
    the judge began his analysis (at paragraph 7) with the words  that,  "I
    note that there were no other reasons under the Immigration Rules  that
    the Respondent considered had not been met and there  were  no  factual
    disputes ..." (paragraph 7).  Where the judge erred was in then  moving
    on to the consideration of the relevant issues before him  because  the
    use  of  the  words,  "turning  therefore  to  the  case  outside   the
    Immigration Rules and whether there should be such a  consideration  on
    Article 8 grounds  ..."  (paragraph  7)  did  not  lead  to  the  judge
    considering the "best interest" of the child, the second  Appellant  in
    this case.  Moreover, whereas the birth of  the  second  child  is  not
    directly relevant, what is relevant is the  pregnancy  of  the  Sponsor
    British citizen which was in its eighth  month,  as  this  was  clearly
    relevant to the Article 8 rights of the  Sponsor  herself.   A  British
    citizen child was then born to her.

11. Mr Pipe also drew attention to the case of Mostafa (Article 8 in  entry
    clearance) [2015] UKUT 00112, which makes it clear that the  extent  of
    compliance with the Immigration Rules is directly relevant to  the  way
    in which the Article 8 ECHR  balance  of  considerations  falls  to  be
    applied.  Mostafa,  submitted  Mr  Pipe,  builds  on  long  established
    authority because (at paragraph 16) reference is made to  the  case  of
    Shamin Box [2002] UKIAT 02212, and it is  said  that  this  "is  to  be
    followed and that the obligation imposed by Article 8 is to promote the
    family life of those affected by the decision".  Plainly, in this case,
    the Sponsor, Yuehua Gao,  was  affected  in  her  family  life  by  the
    decision in question.

12. Finally, as far as Section 117B(b) of the 2014 Act  is  concerned,  the
    balance of considerations  here  would  have  been  in  favour  of  the
    Appellants because there was no financial  dependency  on  anyone,  and
    certainly not the state, so that the public interest considerations did
    not militate against the Appellants.   Mr  Pipe  asked  me  to  make  a
    finding of an error of law and to proceed to remake the decision on the
    evidence before the original judge.

13. For his part, Mr Smart relied upon the Rule 24 response.  He  submitted
    that Section 55 of the BCIA was not relevant because the relevant child
    here is with the parent in China.  The unborn child was not relevant to
    any consideration under Article 8.  It did not go to  the  question  of
    proportionality.  The main question  was  how  near  to  achieving  the
    Immigration Rule the Appellants came.  They were not near achieving the
    requirements  of  the  Rules.   What  was  needed  for  the   financial
    requirement consideration was evidence of the claimed income  in  terms
    of "specified evidence"  and  this  was  not  forthcoming.   There  was
    nothing  preventing  the  Appellants  from  applying  again  with   the
    "specified evidence" in the correct format.

14. In reply, Mr Pipe made two points.  First, that the essence of  Article
    8 is that family life must be promoted and protected.  The Sponsor  was
    eight months pregnant.  This was relevant to the  family  life  of  the
    parties concerned.  Second,  and  even  more  importantly,  the  second
    Appellant child  was  not  considered  at  all  by  the  judge  in  the
    determination in relation  to  Article  8.   The  case  of  Beoku-Betts
    requires the decision maker to look at the rights of the  family  as  a
    whole.   There  was,  however,  an  additional  third  point,  in   the
    submission of  Mr  Pipe.   The  third  point  was  that  the  financial
    requirement was satisfied.

15. This is because if one looks at the Appellant's case, which is set  out
    at paragraph 4(1), it is made clear,  from  the  Appellants'  point  of
    view, that as the judge described in his words,

         "I was referred to all the evidence that was now available  and  to
         the Sponsor's employment history and this clearly demonstrated that
         in the two jobs that the Sponsor undertook  during  the  course  of
         2012 and 2013 she had in total earned more than  the  required  sum
         i.e. �23,200 and this was over the twelve month period prior to the
         date of the decision (see wages slips page 57 and 60  to  61).   It
         was notable that none of this information had  been  challenged  by
         the Respondent.  It was acknowledged that there  were  further  pay
         slips provided which were provided for a period after the  date  of
         decision and that these could not be taken into account".

16. Accordingly, the judge was satisfied that the  evidence  did  meet  the
    requirements of the Rules as far as financial standing  was  concerned.
    It is this that led the judge in his "findings of fact" to  state  that
    "the Sponsor's income is probably sufficient to  meet  the  maintenance
    requirements of the Rules" (see paragraph 7).  Given that this was  so,
    it was entirely wrong to then suggest that there was still a  remaining
    question of the evidence being presented in the "specified  form".   It
    was clear that the parties were  financially  independent.   The  judge
    accepted this as so.  Accordingly, the  constellation  of  these  facts
    should have gone to the proportionality of the decision with respect to
    Article 8.

Error of Law

17. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that I should set the decision aside and remake the decision
    (see Section 12(2) of TCEA 2007).  My reasons are as follows.  This  is
    a case where the Sponsor, Yuehua Gao, is a British citizen  settled  in
    the UK.  She is in a committed relationship with the  first  Appellant,
    Jianchun Chen.  She is also the mother of the second  Appellant  Xinyao
    Chen.  At the time of the hearing before the judge  below  the  Sponsor
    was expecting another child.  Pregnancy notes were put before the judge
    with further documentation, although these have not been referred to by
    the judge.  In point of fact,  however,  neither  has  there  been  any
    reference in the "findings of fact" to the second Appellant, the  child
    aged 12, in terms of her "best interest".  The  second  child  has  now
    been born and is also a British citizen.  Beoku-Betts establishes  that
    there is a right to respect for family life, and that family  life  has
    to be treated as a whole because the sum is larger  than  the  separate
    parts.  These are the basic facts.

18. It remains true, nevertheless, that at the time of the  application  by
    the Appellants to join the Sponsor, Yuehua Gao, there was  a  case  for
    saying that they could not  meet  the  financial  requirements  in  the
    Immigration Rules for the period of six months prior to the application
    because the Sponsor had not been in  employment  for  the  full  twelve
    months  preceding  the  application.   She  began  her  employment   in
    September 2012.  The application was submitted on 21st June 2013.   She
    had been employed by Xing Da Trading Interior Decorations Limited  from
    September 2012 to March 2013.   Her  gross  annual  salary  was  around
    �23,400.  Her gross annual salary from both employers where she worked,
    was above the threshold required under the Rules.  However,  she  could
    not submit pay slips prior to September 2012  because  she  only  began
    working from September 2012 onwards.  The issue of her  being  able  to
    meet the financial requirements of the Rules was the only issue  before
    the judge because accommodation was  conceded  by  the  time  that  the
    matter had been reviewed by the Entry Clearance Manager.

19. When the judge approached this matter, he did so by  recognising  that,
    "There  were  no  factual  disputes"  but  that,  interestingly,   "the
    Sponsor's  income  is  probably  sufficient  to  meet  the  maintenance
    requirements of the Rules" (paragraph 7).  However this  statement  was
    subject to what was said in the preceding paragraph  (at  paragraph  6)
    that "The failure to provide necessary documentary  evidence  with  the
    applications necessarily means that the applications  fail"  (paragraph
    6).  In this case, it was accepted that the Appellant could not produce
    the pay slips for the period of six months preceding  the  application.
    No  issue,  therefore,  arises  in  relation  to   the   judge   having
    misunderstood or misapplied the Immigration Rules.  The approach of the
    judge here was manifestly correct.

20. The judge, however, had to  then  move  on  to  consider  the  position
    outside the Immigration Rules.  He observed that, "Turning therefore to
    the case outside the Immigration Rules and whether there should be such
    a consideration on Article  8  grounds"  the  position  was  that  "The
    decision of the Respondent is a fair one in that the  Appellants  ought
    to have been  in  a  position  to  provide  the  necessary  documentary
    evidence with the applications and the requirements to do so  are  very
    clear" (paragraph 7).  It is here that the judge fell into  error.   To
    suggest  that  the  Article  8  claim  fails  simply  because  if   the
    application fails under the Rules, then a consideration  of  Article  8
    must  mirror  the  decision  made  under  the  Immigration  Rules,   is
    incorrect.  It is incorrect for two reasons.

21. First, the case of MM [2014] EWCA Civ 985,  saw Aikens LJ in the  Court
    of Appeal clarify that,

         "If a particular  person  is  outside  the  Rule  then  he  has  to
         demonstrate, as a preliminary to a consideration outside the  Rule,
         that he has an arguable case that there may  be  good  grounds  for
         granting leave to remain outside the Rules.  ....  If the applicant
         cannot satisfy the Rule, then there either is or  there  is  not  a
         further Article 8 claim" (paragraph 129).

22. In this case, the Rules,  upon  the  proper  construction,  are  not  a
    "complete code" for dealing with a person's Convention rights (as  they
    are in relation to deportation cases) which Aikens LJ also  made  clear
    (see paragraph 135).

23. Second, however, it was plain that in this case there was "an  arguable
    case that there may be  good  grounds  for  granting  leave  to  remain
    outside the Rules", and these good grounds  were  in  relation  to  the
    second Appellant, the child aged 12 years, who was  the  child  of  the
    British citizen sponsoring mother in the UK.  The failure of the  judge
    to give any consideration to this  child  in  terms  of  an  Article  8
    evaluation was an error of law.

24. Accordingly, there has been an error of law in the determination.

Remaking the Decision

25. I have remade the decision on the basis of the findings of the original
    judge, the evidence before him, and the submissions that I  have  heard
    today.

26. I am allowing this appeal for the following reasons.  First, Section 55
    of the BCIA 2009 imposes an obligation upon the responsible party,  and
    not least because there is statutory guidance issued under  Section  55
    which has to  be  taken  into  account,  that,  "An  action  concerning
    children ... undertaken by ... administrative  authorities"  must  have
    regard to Article 3 of the Convention on the Rights of the  Child  1989
    so  that  "the  best  interest  of  the  child  shall  be   a   primary
    consideration".  It is true that the Section 55 BCIA 2009 duty  applies
    only to children within the UK, but established cases now make it clear
    that the broader duty doubtless explains why the Secretary  of  State's
    IDI invites Entry Clearance Officers to consider the statutory guidance
    issued under Section 55: see Mundeba [2013] UKUT 88 and the early  case
    of T (Jamaica) [2011] UKUT 00483.

27. The case of Mundeba makes it clear that once  an  immigration  decision
    engages Article 8 rights, due regard must be had to the  Convention  on
    the Rights of  the  Child  1989.   The  child's  welfare  includes  her
    emotional needs.  The  reference  to  "other  considerations"  means  a
    reference to other aspects of the child's life (see  Mundeba).   It  is
    now well established that where the interests of the  child  are  under
    consideration appropriate enquiries need to be made in entry  clearance
    cases with regard to the age, and the care arrangements  of  the  child
    (see JO (Section 55 duty) Nigeria [2014]  UKUT  00517).   The  decision
    maker must be properly informed of the position of  the  child.   Being
    properly  informed  and  conducting  a   scrupulous   analysis   is   a
    prerequisite  of  identifying  the  child's  best  interest,  and  then
    balancing them with  the  other  essential  consideration.   Performing
    these duties  will  be  an  intensely  fact  sensitive  and  contextual
    exercise.

28. In this case, it is plain that a 12 year old girl must as a question of
    "best interest" be in an environment where she is looked after by  both
    her parents, and not least by her mother.  It is equally plain, that if
    she has a sibling, which she now has and who is also a British citizen,
    then the right to family life must imply a family that is able to  live
    together in the ordinary manner of things as is common place.  The case
    of Mundeba [2013] UKUT 88 is clear in stating that the focus in Section
    55 cases is on the circumstances of the child in the light of her  age,
    social background and development history.  This  requires  an  enquiry
    into whether there is

          a) evidence of neglect or abuse;

          b) there are unmet needs that should be catered for; and

          c) whether there are stable arrangements for the child's physical
             care.

29. Second, Section 55 BCIA also has a  bearing  on  the  consideration  of
    Article 8 rights.  This was made clear by Blake LJ when he stated that,
    "It is difficult to contemplate a scenario where a Section 55 duty  was
    material to an immigration decision and indicated a certain outcome but
    Article 8 did not" (see paragraph 29 of T (Jamaica) [2011] UKUT 00483).
     In this case, the second Appellant is a young girl  in  her  formative
    years of life.  She is being looked after by a  father  when  the  most
    appropriate person for her at that age is her mother.   The  mother  is
    clearly desperate to have her child reunite with her, just  as  she  is
    for her husband, the first Appellant, to be  reunited  with  her.   The
    Sponsor is a person who, on the express findings of the judge below, is
    able to meet the financial requirements, and has been able to cross the
    threshold, such that the Appellants would not be  a  charge  on  public
    funds when admitted, and there  is  a  clear  desire  on  the  part  of
    everyone to be  together  in  the  UK.   In  these  circumstances,  the
    requirements of Article  8  are  plainly  met.   This  is  so  for  the
    following reasons.

30. If one applies Lord Bingham's tabulation in Razgar (paragraph 17),  the
    following emerges.  First, it is plain that the continued exclusion  of
    the Appellants is an interference by a public  authority,  namely,  the
    Secretary of State, with the  exercise  of  the  Appellants'  right  to
    respect for their family  life.   This  family  life  is  qualitatively
    different with the one that the Appellants are currently enjoying in  a
    foreign country, as against one that they would enjoy when they are all
    reunited with the sponsoring wife and mother respectively, of  the  two
    Appellants.

31. Second, the interference here does have consequences of such gravity as
    to potentially engage the operation of Article 8 (bearing in mind  that
    this is a low threshold).  Third, and on the other  hand  however,  the
    interference is in accordance  with  the  law  because  the  Appellants
    cannot meet the Immigration Rules applicable.  Fourth, the interference
    is not necessary in a democratic society, because it is  not  necessary
    for the economic wellbeing of the country, or  for  the  prevention  of
    crime, or for the protection of the  rights  and  freedoms  of  others.
    There is no hint whatsoever of any wrongdoing or illegality by  any  of
    the parties concerned.  In fact, all the evidence is that  the  Sponsor
    is able to satisfy the one requirement that she had to  in  the  appeal
    before the judge below,  namely,  the  financial  requirement  test  by
    showing that funds are available for the purposes of their maintenance.
     Fifth, all in all, the interference here is not proportionate  to  the
    legitimate public end that is sought to be achieved.

32. It  is  well  established  that  the  material  question  engaging  the
    proportionality of an administrative decision that threatens to break a
    family is whether it is reasonable to expect the Appellants  to  remain
    separately from a Sponsor, which in this  case  means  a  12  year  old
    daughter from her British citizen mother, just as much as  it  means  a
    husband from his British citizen wife  in  the  UK,  who  is  now  with
    legitimate status in this country and is settled.  On the facts of this
    case, it is not reasonable.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  on
a point of law such that it  falls  to  be  set  aside.   I  set  aside  the
decision of the original judge.  I remake the  decision  as  follows.   This
appeal is allowed.

No anonymity order is made.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a whole fee award of any fee which  has  been  paid
or may be payable.
