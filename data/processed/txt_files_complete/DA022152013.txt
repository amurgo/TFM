                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The appellant before the Upper Tribunal is the Secretary of  State  for
    the Home Department.  We shall  refer  herein  to  Mr  Quarey  as  "the
    claimant".

 2. Before us is  an  appeal  by  the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department against a determination of the First-tier  Tribunal  (First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Talbot and Mr A Richardson JP  (non-legal  member))
    (hereinafter "the Panel") allowing an appeal against a decision of  the
    Secretary of State made on 29 October 2013 that Section 32(5) of the UK
    Borders Act 2007 applies to the claimant.

 3. For the reasons given below, we have reluctantly decided to dismiss the
    Secretary of State's appeal. Our task is to consider whether the  Panel
    erred in law on the basis alleged; there is otherwise no basis on which
    we can substitute our own decision on the facts. Whether we (or another
    tribunal) would have  allowed  the  appeal  is  only  relevant  to  our
    consideration of whether the perversity challenge is made out.

 4. The claimant, a national of Jamaica, has a poor immigration history  in
    the United Kingdom.  He originally arrived on 21 November 2001  as  the
    holder of a six-month visit visa. For  reasons  that  have  never  been
    satisfactorily explained, the claimant did not leave the United Kingdom
    in accordance with his leave, and has remained  here  unlawfully  since
    its expiry.

 5. He was convicted of possessing controlled drugs (cocaine and heroin) on
    2 November 2011 for which he received modest  fines  of  �30  and  �120
    respectively.  On 12 February 2013 he was convicted of possession of  a
    controlled drug (heroin) with intent to supply as well as  supplying  a
    controlled drug (crack cocaine) and received a sentence of  36  months'
    imprisonment for each, to run  concurrently.   The  sentencing  judge's
    remarks reveal that the claimant also admitted when arrested to dealing
    prohibited drugs for about a year prior to his arrest in October  2012.



 6. The claimant has two children in the United  Kingdom,  the  first  'N',
    born in May 2005 to his former partner, NP; the second, S, born in June
    2008 to the claimant's current partner, SR.   SR  also  has  a  British
    Citizen child born in 2001 to a previous  relationship  and  she  takes
    care of her nephew, JM, a child born in 2004.  There is no dispute that
    the claimant's relationship with SR is genuine and subsisting and  that
    he also has a close relationship with all of his children save  for  N.
    It is accepted by the Secretary of State  that  despite  SR  not  being
    settled in the United Kingdom there are insurmountable obstacles to her
    moving to Jamaica.

 7. The claimant has previously appeared before the First-tier, and  Upper,
    Tribunals in 2010  on  an  appeal  against  the  Secretary  of  State's
    decision refusing him leave to remain on Article 8 grounds.  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Drabu dismissed such appeal  in  a  determination  of  8
    April 2010, Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Sommerville finding no error in
    Judge Drabu's determination in his decision dated 20 January 2011.

Grounds

 8. We move on to the Secretary of State's challenge  now  before  us.   On
    analysis the twelve paragraphs of pleaded grounds resolve down  to  the
    following challenges:

      i) The Panel erred by failing to take lawful account of;

          a) "the Secretary of State's public interest policies" -  and  in
             particular the need to  deter  other  foreign  nationals  from
             committing criminal offences;

          b) the propensity of the claimant to reoffend and the  escalation
             in the seriousness of his offending; and

          c) the fact that the claimant had remained in the United  Kingdom
             illegally.

      i) The Panel failed to provide lawfully adequate reasons for  allowing
         the appeal;

     ii) The Panel's conclusion that there are very compelling  reasons  not
         to deport the claimant, is perverse

Discussion

 9. At the hearing Mr Walker's submissions focused on the  claimed  failure
    of the Panel to take cognisance of the fact that the claimant had  been
    dealing prohibited drugs for twelve  months  prior  to  his  arrest  in
    October 2012. This argument was also put on the alternative basis  that
    the Panel had failed to give adequate weight to  the  entirety  of  the
    claimant's offending history.  It was further observed that neither the
    NOMS 1 report, authored in June 2013, nor the OASys Report, authored in
    November 2013, took into account either  the  2011  conviction  or  the
    twelve months offending prior to the arrest in October  2012.   It  was
    accepted that absent success  on  these  grounds,  none  of  the  other
    pleaded grounds could be made out.

10. In a Rule  24  response  served,  without  apology,  well  outside  the
    timeframe provided for so doing by  the  directions  sent  out  to  the
    parties with the grant of permission, the  claimant  submits  that  the
    Panel "directed themselves appropriately on the law as well as  on  the
    facts", that it gave adequate reasons for its conclusions and that  its
    conclusions were open to it on the  available  evidence.  Mr  Kanu  was
    unable to add anything of substance at  the  hearing  to  that  already
    pleaded in the Rule 24 response.

Did the Panel Fail to Take into Account Relevant Matters?

11. It cannot be said, in our conclusion, that the Panel erred  by  failing
    to take lawful account of (i) the propensity of  the  claimant  to  re-
    offend (ii) the escalation thus far in the seriousness of his offending
    behaviour or (iii) the fact that he has, for the most part, remained in
    the United Kingdom unlawfully.

12. As to the first point, the Panel quoted directly from  the  conclusions
    in the  OASys  Report  [at  18],   accurately  recording  the  author's
    assessment of the risk of the claimant harming  others  (low)  and  the
    risk of the claimant reoffending (also low).

13. As we observed to the parties, the author of the OASys Report proceeded
    on an apparent failure to take into account the  claimant's  conviction
    in 2011. However, this failure was relied  upon  by  the  Secretary  of
    State, either in her decision letter or before the Panel, in support of
    a submission that the  Panel  ought  not  to  rely  upon  the  report's
    conclusions - neither did Mr Walker make such a submission  before  us,
    or seek to amend his grounds.

14. The Panel specifically returned  to  the  issue  of  the  risk  of  the
    claimant reoffending in paragraph 37 of  its  determination,  observing
    the fact of the  2011  conviction  and  a  2003  caution  in  the  same
    paragraph. It  lawfully  found  that  the  claimant  had  now  accepted
    responsibility for his offending behaviour that he  was  motivated  and
    capable of addressing this issue in the future.

15. Also in paragraph 37 of its determination the Panel took  into  account
    the claimant's "blemished" immigration history - and in particular  (i)
    that he had knowingly overstayed since the expiry of his visit visa six
    months after his arrival in the United Kingdom and  (ii)  that  he  had
    made no attempt to regularise his status in the  United  Kingdom  until
    after his arrest for immigration offences.

16. Turning then to the Panel's consideration of  the  public  interest  in
    deporting the claimant, again, we do not accept that the Panel erred in
    failing to take into account material matters.

17. In paragraph 33 of its determination the  Panel  directed  itself  that
    there was an element of deterrence in  deporting  non-British  citizens
    who have committed criminal offences -  citing  a  number  of  relevant
    authorities from the Court of Appeal on  exactly  this  point.   It  is
    difficult to understand in such circumstances how it  can  be  properly
    argued that the Panel did not have this matter in mind when  coming  to
    its conclusions.

18. The same can be said, we find, of the twelve months of offending  prior
    to the claimant's arrest in October 2012.  Although this aspect of  the
    claimant's history did not feature in  the  NOMS  1  report,  there  is
    reference to it, albeit obliquely, in the OASys Report, a document  the
    Panel took fully into account.  At page 9 the  report  identifies  that
    the claimant had "stated [that] he was making in the region of  �100  a
    week through selling drugs.  His partner works and his drug deals  were
    extra finances..."  It is apparent from this passage that the author of
    the report was well aware that the claimant had been selling prohibited
    drugs for a period of  time  prior  to  his  arrest  in  October  2012,
    although it does not specifically identify the length of such period.

19. Further, in paragraph 17 of its determination the Panel cited  verbatim
    from the criminal judge's  sentencing  remarks  of  12  February  2013,
    including a passage identifying the fact that  when  the  claimant  was
    interviewed by  the  Police  he  accepted  that  he  had  been  dealing
    prohibited drugs "for about a year" prior to his arrest on  26  October
    2012.

20. Although no further specific reference is made in the determination  to
    this particular feature of the claimant's offending history, we do  not
    accept that this is a matter that the Panel left out  of  account  when
    coming to its  conclusions.  Both  in  paragraphs  37  and  39  of  its
    determination the Panel took into  account  the  claimant's  "offending
    behaviour".  The use of this phrase, we find, must be taken to  include
    a consideration of the entirety  of  the  offending  behaviour  of  the
    claimant which is set out earlier in the determination - including  the
    convictions in 2011 and 2013, and the admission by the claimant that he
    had been dealing prohibited drugs for twelve months prior to his arrest
    in October 2012.

21. As to the weight to be attached to the  public  interest  in  deporting
    foreign criminals in general, Mr Walker submitted that it was  of  some
    importance that the Panel had failed to direct itself to  the  decision
    of the Court of Appeal in SS (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 550; a  decision
    in which the court made clear that very significant  weight  should  be
    attached to the public interest in deporting foreign criminals who  had
    been sentenced to a term of imprisonment of longer than twelve  months,
    given that Parliament had decreed that such persons should be deported.



22. Whilst it is correct that there was no reference to  this  decision  in
    the determination, this fact of itself is not an  error  that  requires
    the determination  to  be  set  aside  if  the  Panel  nevertheless  in
    substance apply the ratio of that decision.  We observe in this respect
    that the Panel did direct itself to the more  recent  decision  of  the
    Court of Appeal in MF (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 1192 and in  particular
    paragraphs 38 to 45 of that decision, which includes the following:

         "Great weight should be given to the public interest  in  deporting
         foreign criminals who do not satisfy paras 398 and 399 or 399A  ...
         [40]

         The general rule in the present context is that, in the case  of  a
         foreign prisoner to whom paras 399 and  399A  do  not  apply,  very
         compelling reasons will be required to outweigh the public interest
         in deportation.  These  compelling  reasons  are  the  'exceptional
         circumstances'." [43].

23. The Panel further referred to the decision in MF in paragraph 35 of its
    determination, and in paragraph 39 directed itself to the need for  the
    claimant to establish "exceptional circumstances".

24. Looking at the determination in the round we do  not  accept  that  the
    Panel erred in  failing  to  take  into  account  the  fact  that  very
    significant weight that must be attached to deporting foreign criminals
    who have been sentenced to a period of imprisonment in excess of twelve
    months and do not otherwise meet the requirements  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.

25. For these reasons we do not accept that it has  been  established  that
    the Panel failed to take into account relevant matters when coming into
    its conclusions.

Did the Panel give sufficient and adequate reasons for its conclusions?

26. Moving on to the second of  the  grounds;  at  the  hearing  Mr  Walker
    accepted that this, as well as the third ground, had at its  foundation
    a failure of the Panel to take into account a relevant factor.  We have
    found above, though that the Panel did not fail to  take  any  relevant
    matters into account.

27. In any event, in our conclusion the Panel gave sufficient and  adequate
    reasons  for  its  decision.  It  cannot  be  said   that,   when   the
    determination is read as a whole, the Secretary of State is  unable  to
    understand why the claimant was successful before the Panel.

28. The Panel made clear and careful findings of fact, which have not  been
    the subject of challenge before the Upper Tribunal.  It  also  lawfully
    took into account the weight to be attached to the public  interest  in
    deporting foreign criminals such as the claimant, paid full and  proper
    regard to the entirety of the claimant's offending history and set  out
    clearly the adverse effect on the claimant's children/stepchild, one of
    whom has special needs, of the claimant's deportation.

29. Looked at as a whole it cannot be said, in our view, that  the  reasons
    given by the Panel for allowing the appeal were legally inadequate.

Is the Panel's decision perverse?

30. With the reluctance expressed at the outset of this  determination,  we
    also conclude that although the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  is
    possibly not one that another Tribunal might reach on the  same  facts,
    it is plainly within the range of decisions that are capable  of  being
    lawfully made on those facts.  The test of perversity represents a very
    high hurdle (see Brooke LJ in R (Iran) and Others v  SSHD  [2005]  EWCA
    Civ 982 at paragraph 11). In order  to  be  perverse  or  irrational  a
    decision must be so devoid  of  any  plausible  justification  that  no
    reasonable body of persons could have reached it  (Bromley  LBC  v  GLC
    [1983] 1 AC 768, per Lord Diplock).

31. The enquiry for us is not whether the First-tier Tribunal  should  have
    come to a different conclusion but whether the  conclusion  it  reached
    was rationally open to it on all of the available evidence.  As we have
    identified above, we find that it was and  this  final  ground  too  is
    rejected

Decision

The determination of the First-tier Tribunal does not contain an error on  a
point of law and is to remain standing.
