                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. This is an appeal, by the , against the decision of the         First-
      tier Tribunal (Judge Stuart Taylor), sitting at  Taylor  House  on  20
      October 2014, to  under the Immigration Rules an appeal by  a  citizen
      of the Philippines, born 1974.

   2. The parties have helpfully agreed that the Home Office  appeal  should
      be allowed; but only to the  extent  that  the  decision  is  re-made,
      allowing the appellant's appeal under article 8, on the basis that, by
      the date of the hearing before the judge, both relevant children  (who
      have indefinite leave to remain here with their mother)  had  been  in
      this country for over


seven years, so satisfying the requirements of ss. 117B (6) and 117D (1)  of
the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, as inserted by  s.  19  of
the Immigration Act 2014.

Appeals  on above basis
