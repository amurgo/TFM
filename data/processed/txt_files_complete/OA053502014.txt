Representation:
Appellant   Mr Iqbal, Counsel, instructed by Denning Solicitors
Respondent  Mr Kotas (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a national of Pakistan and she applied an  EEA  family
    permit to join her son and EEA national daughter-in-law in  the  United
    Kingdom.

 2. The respondent refused her  application  on  March  10,  2014  and  the
    appellant appealed against that decision under  Regulation  26  of  the
    Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006 on April 17, 2014.

 3. The matter was heard by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Hussain on May
    20, 2015 and in a decision promulgated on June  3,  2015  the  Tribunal
    refused her appeal under the 2006 Regulations.

 4. The appellant applied  for  permission  to  appeal  on  June  17,  2015
    submitting the Tribunal had erred by conducting a hearing  as  an  oral
    hearing when a  paper  hearing  had  been  requested  and  secondly  by
    ignoring evidence that the appellant relied on her son and EEA national
    daughter-in-law for her essential needs.

 5. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Hollingsworth on August 13, 2015 on the basis that it was arguable  the
    Tribunal had applied the wrong burden/standard of proof.

 6. The First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  make  an  anonymity  direction  and
    pursuant to Rule 14 of The Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 I see no reason to make an order now.

    SUBMISSIONS

 7. Mr Iqbal did not pursue the first ground of appeal with any vigour  but
    indicated that this was a matter for myself to  determine.  He  further
    submitted that the Tribunal had taken the relevant date as the date  of
    application whereas the correct date  was  the  date  of  decision.  In
    support of his submission he referred to the fact that the Tribunal had
    noted when the statement had been signed by the appellant's  other  son
    (who had been living with the appellant at the time the application was
    made). However, he also submitted that that  at  that  date  there  was
    ample evidence contained within  a  large  bundle  of  documents  which
    demonstrated the appellant's son and daughter-in-law  were  responsible
    for her essential needs. The Tribunal has failed to  make  findings  on
    the fact that monies had been sent over a period of time and  Mr  Iqbal
    referred me to the fact that the application form made  it  clear  that
    the appellant's son and daughter-in-law had paid  for  the  appellant's
    accommodation and living expenses. Whatever interest her other son  had
    in the property the fact remained that her essential needs were met  by
    the UK based son. He submitted that there was a material error.

 8. Mr Kotas relied on the Rule 24 statement  dated  October  2,  2015  and
    submitted that the Tribunal had properly considered the evidence in its
    decision.  The submissions amounted  to  a  mere  disagreement  to  the
    evidence and as this had been dealt with on  the  papers,  despite  the
    reference to a presenting officer being present in  the  decision,  the
    Tribunal had been entitled to assess the documents  in  the  manner  it
    did.

    DISCUSSION AND FINDINGS

 9. Permission to appeal had been granted to the appellant on the basis  it
    was arguable that the Tribunal had erred in its approach to the  burden
    and standard of proof. Neither representative took this  issue  at  the
    hearing before me and I am satisfied that there was  no  merit  to  the
    point highlighted in the grant of permission to appeal.

10. On the front sheet of its decision the Tribunal referred to Ms Khan  as
    representing the Home Office. I have checked the court  record  on  the
    court file and there is no reference to Ms Khan making any  submissions
    whatsoever. It seems entirely possible that the matter remained in  the
    Tribunal's list of business for that day but neither the court file nor
    the respondent's own file suggested  any  submissions  had  been  made.
    There is no evidence of any unfairness and I dismiss the  first  ground
    of appeal.

11. The second issue raised related to the date that the tribunal  assessed
    this application on. Mr Iqbal referred me to  the  Tribunal's  decision
    and in particular paragraph [6] of the decision. In that paragraph  the
    Tribunal noted that the application form was  signed  on  February  19,
    2014 and further noted that the appellant's  other  son,  who  now  was
    married and living in Britain with a British wife, must have been there
    at the date the application form was signed. There is nothing  in  that
    paragraph which  suggests  that  the  Tribunal  treated  the  date  the
    application was submitted as the relevant date.

12. In any event, the evidence before the  Tribunal  was  unclear  in  that
    there was no evidence in any of the witness statements  that  suggested
    this son had migrated to the United  Kingdom  before  the  respondent's
    decision was made. The Tribunal was entitled to assume, in the  absence
    of any other evidence, that the appellant's son was still  living  with
    the appellant in Pakistan when the respondent  made  its  decision.  In
    fact, there was  evidence  within  the  documents  that  suggested  the
    appellant's son arrived in the United Kingdom after the application had
    been considered-a point confirmed in the grounds of appeal at paragraph
    [2] of the grounds. I am therefore satisfied that the Tribunal did  not
    make any error in relation to the date that it applied  when  assessing
    the evidence.

13. Mr Iqbal's strongest argument related to the Tribunal's approach to the
    financial evidence that had been submitted in the  appellant's  bundle.
    He submitted that  there  was  evidence  within  the  bundle  that  the
    tribunal had overlooked when assessing whether the appellant's son  and
    his  EEA  national  wife  had  been  responsible  for  the  appellant's
    essential needs.

14. This was a case that was dealt with on the papers and it is clear  from
    paragraph [2] of the Tribunal's decision that the  Tribunal  was  aware
    and had noted that regular monthly payments of ï¿½97 had been  sent  from
    the United Kingdom to the appellant in Pakistan.

15. However, the Tribunal placed weight on  the  fact  that  the  appellant
    continued to live with her eldest son and whilst funds had been sent to
    her the Tribunal had concluded that this did not  mean  the  UK  family
    were responsible for her essential needs.

16. Whilst no case law was referred to in the decision I feel it  would  be
    of assistance to set out the appropriate case law.

17. In Jia Migrationsverket Case C  -1/05  the  European  Court  considered
    "dependence" under Article 1(1)(d) of  Directive  73/148/EEC  and  said
    this was to be interpreted to the effect that "dependent on them" meant
    that members of the family of an EU  national  established  in  another
    member state within the meaning of Article 43 of the EC Treaty,  needed
    the material support of that EU national, or  his  or  her  spouse,  in
    order to meet their essential needs in the state  of  origin  of  those
    family members or the state from which they had come at the  time  when
    they applied to join the EU national.

18. In Moneke (EEA - OFMs) Nigeria [2011] UKUT 00341(IAC) at para [41]  the
    Tribunal accepted that the  definition  of  dependency  was  accurately
    captured by the current UKBA ECIs which read as follows at ch.5.12: "In
    determining if a family member or extended family member  is  dependent
    (i.e. financially dependent) on  the  relevant  EEA  national  for  the
    purposes  of  the  EEA  Regulations:  Financial  dependency  should  be
    interpreted as meaning that the person needs financial support from the
    EEA national or his/her spouse/civil partner in order to  meet  his/her
    essential needs - not in order to  have  a  certain  level  of  income.
    Provided a person would not be able to meet  his/her  essential  living
    needs without the financial support of the EEA national, s/he should be
    considered dependent on that national. In those circumstances, it  does
    not matter  that  the  applicant  may  in  addition  receive  financial
    support/income from other sources. There is no need  to  determine  the
    reasons for recourse to the  financial  support  provided  by  the  EEA
    national or to consider  whether  the  applicant  is  able  to  support
    him/herself by taking up paid employment. The person does not  need  to
    be living or have lived in an EEA state which the EEA national  sponsor
    also lives or has lived." At paragraph 42 the Tribunal went on  "We  of
    course accept (and as the ECIs reflect) that dependency does  not  have
    to be "necessary" in the sense of the Immigration Rules, that is to say
    an able bodied person who chooses to rely for his  essential  needs  on
    material support of the sponsor may be entitled to do  so  even  if  he
    could meet those needs from his or her economic activity."

19. In assessing whether a material error has occurred I have had regard to
    the fact that payments were sent for approximately 6  months  prior  to
    the date of application. Although there were regular  payments  I  must
    also have regard to the fact that  the  appellant  was  living  in  the
    family home and according to her son who at the date  of  decision  was
    living with his EEA national wife his brother was looking  after  their
    mother. Evidence of this can be found in paragraph  [7]  of  the  son's
    witness statement and paragraph [6] of the appellant's EEA daughter-in-
    law's statement that their brother/brother-in-law, Raja Nouman  Khalid,
    was caring for the appellant until he came to the United Kingdom.

20. In her own witness statement, the appellant also  stated  at  paragraph
    [3] that she was assisted by her son,  Raja  Nouman  Khalid,  until  he
    married and went to live in the United Kingdom.

21. In the circumstances, I am satisfied the Tribunal took account  of  the
    financial support but was entitled to  conclude  that  the  appellant's
    essential needs were being met  by  someone  other  than  her  son  and
    daughter-in-law  who  were  living  in  the  United  Kingdom  when  the
    respondent's decision was made.

22. The position may be different now and the  outcome  different  but  the
    Tribunal, as am I, was only concerned with the position as at the  date
    of decision.

23. I therefore find there has been no error of law.

    DECISION

24. There was no material error.

25. I uphold the original decision and dismiss the appeal.
