                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant, Aamir Saleem, came to  this  country  from  Pakistan  in
    1997 with a 'marriage visa', and  in  due  course  obtained  indefinite
    leave to remain here with his British wife.  Three children  were  born
    to the couple, who lived in Reading,  but  by  2007  the  marriage  was
    breaking up, and in 2008 Mr  Saleem  went  to  live  in  Middlesbrough.
    There is conflict in the evidence as to how much contact  he  had  with
    the children thereafter.  Mr Saleem says  that  he  would  go  down  to
    Reading every month to see the children, and that they and their mother
    stayed with him in Middlesbrough for four weeks in 2009.  On the  other
    hand, the three children told a Family Support Worker in  January  2012
    that they had not seen their father for several years.  At all  events,
    contact ceased in March 2010 when Mr Saleem was arrested  for  a  drugs
    offence.  He was later convicted of being knowingly  concerned  in  the
    supply of a Class B drug (not Class C, which was the impression  formed
    by the Criminal Casework Directorate  of  the  Home  Office),  and  was
    sentenced to 14 months' imprisonment.

2.   This sentence rendered Mr Saleem  liable  to  'automatic'  deportation,
    and in deciding whether one of the exceptions in section 33 of  the  UK
    Borders Act applied, the Criminal Casework Directorate sought the views
    of Mr Saleem's ex-wife (they  were   divorced  in  July  2011),  as  to
    whether the best interests of the children would be served  by  letting
    their father remain in the United Kingdom.  Their mother replied in  no
    uncertain terms that they would be  better  off  without  him.   Having
    ascertained that there had been an incident  of  domestic  violence  in
    2007, and that there were no current proceedings for contact,  the  CCD
    concluded that  Mr  Saleem's  deportation  would  indeed  not  put  the
    respondent in breach of her section 55 duty to  safeguard  and  promote
    the welfare of the children.

3.   A deportation order was duly made on 19th  July  2011,  and  an  appeal
    came before the First-tier Tribunal on 12th  December  2011.   A  panel
    comprising Judge Jhirad and  Ms  Padfield,  JP  dismissed  the  appeal,
    partly because the appellant was "estranged  from  wife  and  children,
    [and] there is no evidence that he has pursued contact with them in the
    past or had a meaningful relationship with them."  When  permission  to
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal was granted and  the  matter  came  before
    Upper Tribunal Judge Kopieczek, two pieces of evidence were highlighted
    which the First-tier Tribunal had overlooked.  In June 2010,  prior  to
    being informed that he was liable to  deportation,  the  appellant  had
    instructed Wilson & Co. to  initiate  contact  proceedings.   Secondly,
    although the panel had mentioned  the  supplementary  letter  from  the
    Border Agency of 7th December 2011, they  did  not  factor  into  their
    decision the information in that letter that  Mr  Saleem's  application
    for a contact order was to be heard by a Family Court in January  2012,
    just a few weeks after the deportation hearing scheduled  for  December
    2011.  That hearing had previously been adjourned in order to await the
    outcome of a Family Court hearing in November 2011, which the appellant
    was unable to attend because of a problem with the escort service.

4.   In the light of MS (Ivory Coast) and MH (Morocco), which disapprove  of
    determining  an  appeal  against  deportation  when  there  are  family
    proceedings pending, it was held that the First-tier Tribunal had erred
    in law by so doing, and that the decision on the appeal would  have  to
    be re-made by the  Upper  Tribunal.   Directions  were  given  for  the
    disclosure of all CAFCASS reports and of any orders made by the  County
    Court in the family proceedings.

5.   When the matter came before me, a CAFCASS report of  January  2012  was
    indeed made available, showing that a Family Support Worker had met the
    three children individually in December  2011  in  order  to  ascertain
    their wishes and feelings.  All three said that their  father  had  not
    bothered with them in the past, and that they  did  not  want  to  have
    contact with him.  The two older children could remember an incident of
    domestic violence.  In the light of this report, a Family Court Advisor
    recommended no direct  contact,  but  suggested  that  "the  Court  may
    consider it is in the children['s]  interest  to  receive  letters  and
    postcards from their father in order to maintain their identity as they
    get older."  In July 2013 another CAFCASS letter to the Court recounted
    a telephone call to Mr Saleem, who ascribed his ex-wife's hostility  to
    the fact that her brother had been married to Mr Saleem's  sister,  and
    the latter had divorced him.  This had caused difficulties with his own
    marriage.  But  despite  his  former  wife's  hostility,  his  son  had
    recently contacted him on a friend's mobile phone.  The contact  order,
    when it finally came on  27th  November  2013,  was  for  very  limited
    contact.  Mr Saleem would be allowed to write four letters per year  to
    each of the children, these communications to  be  monitored  by  their
    mother.

6.   Shortly afterwards, the  appeal  came  before  me,  and  I  heard  oral
    evidence from the appellant and his sister,  who  divorced  his  wife's
    brother and who has been living with the appellant in Middlesbrough for
    several years.  There was also a  recent  letter  from  Fulcrum,  a  GP
    service "supporting recovery from addiction".  The appellant  has  been
    taking heroin for many years, and a Recovery Support Worker  tells  how
    Mr Saleem  has  been  prescribed  Methadone,  doses  of  15  mls  being
    collected on a daily basis.  The appellant had missed three days  in  a
    row early in  December  2013,  which  caused  his  prescription  to  be
    cancelled.  But it had now resumed.  The Recovery  Support  Worker  was
    unable to say how long this prescriptive treatment would last.

7.   In his oral evidence, the appellant assured me  that  he  was  fighting
    his heroin addiction.  His doses of  Methadone  had  been  successively
    decreasing, and as soon as he was clear,  he  would  apply  for  direct
    contact with his children.  But he acknowledged that in a 'hair  strand
    analysis', he had tested positive for both Methadone  and  heroin.   He
    elaborated on the telephone contact which he had managed to  have  with
    his son when the latter went to Pakistan last year, contact  which  was
    confirmed in witness statements from  his  uncle  and  his  sister.   I
    allowed the appellant to address me at length about his  life  history.
    His parents, he said, had been killed in a family feud about land,  and
    this had caused him to make an asylum claim  in  May  2011,  which  was
    subsequently withdrawn.  He was enticed into taking drugs by his wife's
    brother, and this was the cause of all his troubles, because this man's
    drug-taking had caused the appellant's sister to divorce him, and  then
    the  appellant's  wife,  whose  brother  had  been  divorced   by   the
    appellant's sister, in turn divorced the appellant.  The appellant's ex-
    wife had tried to turn his children against him,  but  in  reality  his
    children did want to have contact with him.

8.   The appellant's sister, in her oral evidence, confirmed  this  account,
    saying that she had lived with the appellant  since  her  own  marriage
    broke  down  in  2008.   But  she  did  not  really  know   people   in
    Middlesbrough, just her uncle, and she would  be  very  lonely  if  the
    appellant were deported  to  Pakistan.   She  seemed  uncertain  as  to
    whether the appellant was still taking heroin, or just Methadone.

9.   In her closing submissions, Miss Rackstraw cautioned against  accepting
    all that the appellant had said.  His account of events in Pakistan had
    to be taken with a pinch of salt.  Before the  First-tier  Tribunal  he
    had claimed to have no brothers in Pakistan, but then admitted that  he
    had five.  He now claimed that the report of his children's wishes  and
    feelings, as recorded by a CAFCASS worker, did not truly  reflect  what
    they thought.  They had been put up to it  by  their  mother.   On  the
    contrary, argued Miss Rackstraw, the experienced CAFCASS  worker  would
    have been aware of this possibility, and would be well able  to  detect
    undue influence.  The appellant simply had no  family  life,  and  very
    limited private life in the United Kingdom, having been  employed  only
    for a few months in a pizzeria.

10.  Miss Rasoul handed up  what  purported  to  be  text  messages  to  the
    appellant from his son.  Despite an objection from  Miss  Rackstraw,  I
    admitted the document, which Miss Rasoul said was evidence  of  contact
    between father and son.  Direct contact was a distinct  possibility  in
    the future, and the appellant could be a positive force for good in his
    children's lives.  The allegation of domestic  violence  had  not  been
    followed up by the police, and it was notable that the appellant's drug
    addiction, which he was trying hard to kick, had not led him into other
    crimes than the one of supplying cannabis.  The Pre-Sentence Report had
    assessed him as being at low risk of harm, while the  Trial  Judge  had
    taken him to be a man of previous good  character.   There  was  family
    life between the appellant and his  sister,  and  every  likelihood  of
    meaningful family life between him and his children in the future.

Discussion

11.  Despite the best efforts of Miss Rasoul, the recent d�nouement  of  the
    Family Court proceedings has deprived the appellant of what would  have
    been the weightiest factor  going  onto  his  side  of  the  Article  8
    balance.  The appeal can only  succeed  under  Article  8  outside  the
    Rules, and the appellant cannot rely on his private life.  He has  only
    worked for a few months since coming here in 1997, and only  his  uncle
    and sister in Middlesbrough have come forward  to  support  him.   Miss
    Rasoul submits that the appellant enjoys family life with  his  sister,
    but for the  purposes  of  Article  8  there  must  be  an  element  of
    dependency going beyond the normal  ties  of  affection  between  adult
    siblings who are living under the same roof.  Such  unusual  dependency
    has not been established here.  Direct contact with  his  children  and
    meaningful participation in their upbringing would certainly have given
    the appellant a strong family life claim,  but  the  current  level  of
    contact authorised by the Court is too exiguous  to  amount  to  family
    life, while the prospects of the appellant getting direct  contact  are
    too uncertain to be placed in the proportionality  balance.   He  would
    need to be completely drug-free before applying  for  a  more  generous
    contact order, and the fact that he is still taking heroin as  well  as
    Methadone pushes the date when this is likely to happen  far  into  the
    future.  I can accept that there was  some  telephone  contact  between
    father and son in 2012, but that does not  mean  that  the  appellant's
    children were not telling the truth to the lady from  CAFCASS  who  was
    ascertaining their wishes and feelings.  As Miss Rackstraw submits, the
    CAFCASS interviewer would have been alert to the possibility  of  undue
    influence from the mother who had custody of the children, and who  was
    ill-disposed towards their father.

12.  Absent a finding that the  best  interests  of  the  children  will  be
    adversely affected by the appellant's removal, there is little  to  put
    on the appellant's side of the Article 8 balance.  On  the  other  side
    there is the public interest in deportation as a response  to  criminal
    activity, even when there is a low risk of re-offending.  For an appeal
    against deportation to succeed under Article 8 outside  the  Rules,  it
    has been  held  in  MF  (Nigeria)  [2013]  EWCA  Civ  1192  that  "very
    compelling reasons will be needed to outweigh the  public  interest  in
    deportation."  Such reasons are simply not  available  in  the  present
    case.


     DECISION

     The appeal is dismissed.
