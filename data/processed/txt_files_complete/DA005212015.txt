Representation:
For the appellant:  Edward Nicholson (counsel instructed by Jein)
For the respondent: Miss Julie Isherwood

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.     This is an appeal, by the , against the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Shazadi Beg), sitting at Taylor House on 12 April 2016,
    to  an EEA deportation  appeal by  a  citizen  of  Lithuania,  born  29
    December 1978. Permission was given on two grounds, as to  whether  the
    judge had

      a) been entitled on the evidence  before  her  to  conclude  that  the
         appellant had not established a permanent right of  residence  here
         under  reg.  15  of  the  Immigration  (European   Economic   Area)
         Regulations 2006 [the EEA Regulations]; and

      b) correctly considered the  principles  of  proportionality  set  out
         under reg. 21 (5).

 2. History   In 1997 the appellant had  received  a  sentence,  eventually
    reduced to 9� years' imprisonment on appeal, for an  offence  described
    in Lithuanian court papers  as  'intentional  murder  with  aggravating
    circumstances'. At some time after Lithuanian accession to  the  EU  in
    2004, he had been released on licence and come to this  country,  where
    he was by this time entitled to unrestricted access.

 3. That had however amounted  to  a  breach  of  the  appellant's  licence
    conditions, so according to him,  he  was  returned  in  2008  under  a
    European Arrest Warrant [EAW] to Lithuania to serve  the  remainder  of
    his sentence, till he was again released on licence on 5 May 2009. Then
    he had come back to this country again, on the  version  of  the  facts
    accepted by the judge in March 2010. The appellant said he was seen  on
    arrival by an immigration officer, and told he  was  no  longer  wanted
    under the EAW, as he had served his sentence.

 4. However, on 26 November 2014, the Home  Office  drew  up  a  notice  of
    intention to deport the appellant, though they were unable to serve  it
    till after police told them they had come across him on 30 March  2015.
    On the 31st the appellant was arrested and served  with  a  deportation
    order, which is the effective date of the decision under appeal. On  27
    April he was returned to Lithuania, according to him  voluntarily,  and
    filed this appeal from there on 22 May.

 5. Permanent residence    The appellant's claim to five years'  qualifying
    residence was supported, apart from his own evidence, only by copies of
    Revenue tax calculations for his self-employed  building  work  in  the
    years 2009 - 10, 2010 - 11, 2011 - 12, 2012 - 13, 2013 - 14 and 2014  -
    15. The judge's conclusions  on  this  evidence  are  set  out  at  her
    paragraph 14:

       I find however that there  is  no  credibility  documentary  evidence
       before me that throughout a five year period he was employed  in  the
       United Kingdom. The HM Revenue and Customs documents related  to  the
       appellant's   claimed   self-employment   without    supporting    or
       corroborative evidence of a continuous period  of  employment  for  a
       five year period.

 6. Mr Nicholson argued  that  the  judge  was  asking  herself  the  wrong
    question. An EEA citizen who has lived in the United  Kingdom  "...  in
    accordance with the Regulations for a continuous period of five  years"
    (see reg. 15 (1)) is  to  have  a  permanent  right  of  residence.  Mr
    Nicholson suggested that the judge's reference to  'employment'  showed
    she was looking for a continuity not required by the Regulations for  a
    self-employed person. That expression (see reg. 4 (1) (b)) simply means
    "a person who establishes himself in order to pursue activity as a self-
    employed person ...".

 7. I do not accept this argument. The judge had  just  referred  to  self-
    employment herself, and it is  perfectly  clear  that,  when  she  said
    'employment' in the next  line,  she  meant  'self-employment'.  Anyone
    reading her decision to make sense of it, rather  than  to  find  fault
    with it, can easily see that.

 8. The other reason why this challenge fails is that  the  judge  did  not
    reject the appellant's case on this point because of any  discontinuity
    between specific periods of work (to use  a  neutral  expression);  but
    because she was not satisfied on the evidence before her  that  he  was
    here on that basis for the necessary five years. So far as the duration
    of that period is concerned, it had to end on the effective date of the
    decision under appeal, which was 31 March 2015; so the judge needed  to
    be satisfied that the appellant  had  established  himself  here  as  a
    worker before the end of March 2010.





 9. That was the month in which, on the version of the  facts  accepted  by
    the judge, the  applicant  had  last  returned  to  this  country.  The
    supporting evidence to show that he had established himself here  as  a
    worker before the end of it is limited to a tax calculation [AB 62], of
    course based on evidence he had provided himself in his return, showing
    that he had made a profit from self-employment in the year to  5  April
    2010 of �4,370. Mr Nicholson made a forlorn suggestion that this  might
    have been based on previous earnings; but the appellant had  been  back
    in Lithuania since  2008,  and  the  calculation  itself,  taking  into
    account his personal allowance for the year 2009 - 10,  resulted  in  a
    figure of �1030 overpaid by him.

10. The obvious difficulty in  making  a  profit  of  over  �4,000  in  the
    appellant's first  month  back  in  this  country  as  a  self-employed
    building worker is enough to show why the judge was fully  entitled  to
    look for some more supporting evidence that he was established in self-
    employment during that time than was provided by the result of his  own
    tax return.

11. The judge was entitled on the evidence before her not  to  accept  that
    this appellant had acquired a permanent  right  of  residence  in  this
    country by the date of the decision under appeal, and so did  not  need
    to look for 'serious grounds of public policy' (see  reg.  21  (3))  to
    support it.

12. Proportionality However, there still needed to be  'grounds  of  public
    policy (see reg. 19 (1)), as the judge  recognized;  and  the  decision
    needed to be taken under the principles set out in reg. 21 (5):

       (a) the decision must comply with the principle of proportionality;

       (b) the decision must be based exclusively on the personal conduct of
         the person concerned;

       (c) the personal conduct of the person  concerned  must  represent  a
         genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one  of
         the fundamental interests of society;

       (d) matters isolated from the particulars of the case or which relate
         to  considerations  of  general  prevention  do  not  justify  the
         decision;

       (e) a person's previous criminal convictions  do  not  in  themselves
         justify the decision.

13. While the judge made a number of  findings  of  fact  relevant  to  the
    resolution of these points, she did not make an express finding on  any
    of them, except for (c). Her conclusions  were  as  follows  (paragraph
    23):

       In considering the evidence as a whole, I find that  the  seriousness
       of the offence, coupled with a lack  of  remorse  and  rehabilitation
       leads me to the conclusion that the appellant would pose  a  genuine,
       present and sufficiently serious threat to  the  interest  of  public
       policy affecting the fundamental interests of society  sufficient  to
       justify his expulsion.

14. The suggestion in the grounds of appeal (not by Mr Nicholson,  who  did
    not appear below) that the judge was motivated by questions of  general
    deterrence, excluded by sub-paragraphs (b) and (d), is not borne out by
    anything  in  her  decision  itself.  It  is  clear  from  the  judge's
    paragraphs 15  -  17  that  she  did  consider  the  facts  behind  the
    appellant's conviction, and his attitude to them  since,  and  was  not
    justifying the decision under appeal by the conviction alone,  contrary
    to sub-paragraph (e).

15. So far as proportionality itself (a) is concerned, the  judge  did  not
    mention the word anywhere in her conclusions; but  this  appellant  has
    separated from his partner in this country, has no family here, and, if
    she were entitled to decide that he represented the  required  genuine,
    present and sufficiently serious threat,  then  there  was  nothing  in
    whatever ordinary friendships he  may  have  to  make  his  deportation
    disproportionate to the legitimate purpose of .

16. The real question is whether the judge was entitled,  for  the  reasons
    she gave, to reach the conclusion she did on sub-paragraph (c). In  the
    absence of the appellant, she had to do  the  best  she  could  on  the
    material before her; but that made it doubly important to show that she
    had taken into account all  the  relevant  points  in  the  appellant's
    favour.

17. The judge was well entitled to make the observations she did about  the
    applicant seeming to minimize the offence, taken against the  statement
    of it as 'intentional murder with aggravating circumstances'; but those
    were made in the light of what he says about it in paragraph 4  of  his
    statement of 8 April 2016. In my view, before she went on  to  say  (at
    paragraph 15) "There also appears to be no remorse or  rehabilitation",
    she needed at least to consider what the  appellant  went  on  to  say:
    "This accident has completely changed my life. I was scared,  lost  and
    very sorry for what had happened to the person ...". It would of course
    been for her to decide whether or not  she  accepted  his  evidence  on
    this.

18. On rehabilitation, the judge took into account (paragraph 21) the  many
    years that had passed since the appellant's conviction; but she went on
    to say "Nevertheless there  is  no  evidence  before  me  that  he  has
    undergone a rehabilitation programme in Lithuania". While the appellant
    had of course absconded to  this  country  from  his  first  period  on
    licence there, he had paid the penalty for that on return by serving  a
    further  period  in  custody,  served,  according  to  him   (statement
    paragraph 13) in an open prison, followed by another  period  which  he
    spent on licence. The appellant himself describes that period as  being
    on probation: whether it included any supervision or reporting,  as  in
    this country, his statement  does  not  say.  It  is  also  not  clear,
    depending on when he came back here, whether he  served  out  the  full
    period of his licence.

19. However, in my view the judge needed closely to consider what,  if  any
    present risk this appellant presented, rather than to concentrate quite
    so much on his expressed attitude to past events, however serious. This
    was hard, without him before her; but I have  come  to  the  conclusion
    that her decision on the question of whether he  presented  a  genuine,
    present and sufficiently serious threat must be set aside and  re-made.
    For that to be done properly, the appellant had to be provided with  an
    opportunity to give oral evidence before me.

FRESH HEARING

20. This was arranged  by  way  of  a  web-cam  video-link  direct  to  the
    appellant  in  Lithuania:  he  identified  himself  by  producing   his
    passport. After confirming his  witness  statement  of  8  April  2016,
    obviously professionally taken, and read over to him  by  a  Lithuanian
    interpreter before he signed it, he gave further evidence, on which  he
    was cross-examined.

21. The only issue before me was whether  the  appellant  now  presented  a
    genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one  of  the
    fundamental interests of society, of course bearing in mind  the  other
    considerations in reg. 21 (5), set out at 12. I have to deal  with  the
    case without any of the material  usually  found  where  someone  faces
    removal or  exclusion  after  committing  a  serious  offence  in  this
    country. There are no remarks by the sentencing judge, nor  any  report
    from the National Offender Management Service [NOMS]. I  have  to  deal
    with the case against the appellant on the basis of the only Lithuanian
    document  available,  which  is  the  certificate  of  conviction,   in
    considerably longer form than is usual in this country: however it says
    nothing about the facts of the appellant's offences.

22. Briefly, the  convictions,  sentences  and  other  orders  against  the
    appellant were as follows, putting them into English terms  so  far  as
    necessary for clarity:

    24.06.1996      'hooliganism': 1 year's imprisonment, suspended  for  1
                 year
    03.03.1997      a drugs offence: 2� years' imprisonment, including  the
                 suspended sentence
    01.10.1997      'intentional murder with aggravating circumstances': 10
                 years' imprisonment, 11 including the suspended sentence
    13.01.1999      replaced on appeal  with  conviction  for  'intentional
                 murder'  (without  aggravating  circumstances):  8�  years'
                 imprisonment  substituted,  9�  including   the   suspended
                 sentence
    05.06.2003      released on licence for remaining  term  (just  over  3
                 years)
    07.12.2004      ordered to be returned to prison to serve remainder  of
                 sentence
    21.02.2008      returned, first to closed, and then to open prison
    05.05.2009      released from open prison for remaining term  (about  1
                 year 10 months 20 days, credit  being  given  for  13  days
                 served in this country awaiting removal to Lithuania).  The
                 terms of his licence required him to report twice a  month,
                 to keep a curfew from 2300  -  0600,  unless  required  for
                 work,  and  not  to  cross  district   boundaries   without
                 permission

23. The appellant's own account  of  the  incident  which  led  him  to  be
    convicted of murder appears at paragraph 4 of his statement:

       On  01  October  1997  I  was  sentenced  2  years  imprisonment  for
       manslaughter. I and my friends (other students) were on our way  home
       from the school. Everyone started arguing while walking home.  I  was
       defending my friend on the street and got involved into  an  argument
       that led to a fight. A guy who started the argument was a  friend  of
       mine too, and he fell on the ground and hit his head. It  was  winter
       and the road was covered with ice. We all got very scared and  called
       a taxi to take him home. We took him to my friends flat and I  called
       the ambulance and he was taken to hospital. Unfortunately  my  friend
       died in hospital. This accident has completely changed my life. I was
       scared, lost and very sorry for what had happened to  the  person.  I
       was in shock and could not understand what had  happened  and  why  I
       started fighting. I have tried to explain to the  boy's  parents  but
       they did not want to listen. I gave my sympathy many times.



24. The appellant's other convictions are of  very  much  less  importance,
    except so far as the one for 'hooliganism' in 1996  might  suggest  any
    continuing propensity for violence. He explains that on the basis  that
    a drunk had started touching him up in a lift, and so he had got into a
    fight with him. He says that, when he was first released on licence  in
    2003, he had not been able to find any work in Lithuania, so  had  come
    to this country in 2004, when  the  accession  arrangements  made  that
    possible. He had planned to go home monthly and sign on, but  ended  up
    working hard in the building industry here till arrested on the EAW for
    breaking the terms of his licence at the end of 2007.

25. The appellant says at paragraph 14 of his statement that he returned to
    this country on 2 April 2011, and there is nothing in the  Home  Office
    material to contradict this. It is  clear  from  the  Lithuanian  court
    orders that, assuming that date is right, the appellant did  not  leave
    Lithuania again this time till his licence had expired. He has not been
    convicted of any further offences,  either  in  Lithuania  or  in  this
    country.

26. In oral evidence, the appellant accepted that his final conviction  had
    been for intentional murder, not for  manslaughter:  "The  court  knows
    better, but I didn't intend to kill anyone. Only God  can  take  life".
    Cross-examined about his previous conviction for 'hooliganism', he said
    he had sworn to God never to hit anyone again, and regretted  what  had
    happened in 1996 - 97, which would  never  be  repeated.  He  had  been
    praying, and was living under the worry of what he  had  done.  He  had
    lost the chance of any higher education, as there had been  no  courses
    in prison which would take him beyond the level he had already reached.



27. Cross-examined about whether in fact  he  was  worried  about  his  own
    future, the appellant replied that his worries were about the young man
    who "... should have lived and had a family and enjoyed his  life,  but
    lost everything". As for why he had come here in 2004 in breach of  his
    licence, he was very sorry about breaking the law in Lithuania, but had
    found things very hard on his release.  The  appellant  explained  that
    licence  arrangements  in  Lithuania  made  no  provision  for   formal
    rehabilitation: the main thing was to keep to the terms of  the  order,
    get work and pay taxes, which he had done when finally released. He had
    also taken various vocational qualifications in construction.

28. Submissions     Miss Isherwood suggested that the appellant's  previous
    conviction for 'hooliganism' did show a propensity for violence on  his
    part. He didn't accept the fact of his conviction for murder, which  he
    had described in his statement  as  manslaughter,  despite  having  the
    Lithuanian court order to refer to. Then he had broken his  licence  by
    coming here, and not returned till  compelled  to  under  the  EAW.  Mr
    Nicholson had referred in his skeleton argument to  Straszewski  [2015]
    EWCA Civ 1245, and Miss Isherwood  pointed  out  that  both  the  cases
    decided there had involved persons with a permanent right of residence,
    where serious grounds of public policy were required for removal.


29. Law       In Straszewski , the Court of Appeal (Moore-Bick  LJ,  giving
    the only reasoned judgment) had referred at paragraph 16 to the opinion
    of the Advocate-General of the European Court of Justice in  Bouchereau
    [1978] QB 732, to the effect that it was  possible  that  past  conduct
    alone might constitute a  genuine,  present  and  sufficiently  serious
    threat; but while the requirement for such a threat was acknowledged in
    the European Court's decision,  Moore-Bick LJ went on  at  17  to  note
    that


      This seems to me to emphasise the need to look to  the  future  rather
      than the past in all but the most exceptional cases and  to  emphasise
      the importance of the right of free movement. I agree with Mr. Drabble
      Q.C. that one can detect in the decision an understandable element  of
      pragmatism in the recognition of the right to deport  those  who  have
      committed the most heinous  of  crimes  which  is  at  odds  with  the
      principles of the Directive.

30. Mr Nicholson submitted that, in  view  of  the  strictures  on  Marchon
    [1993] Imm AR 384 at the end of  paragraph  19  in  Straszewski  ,  the
    reservation for 'the most exceptional cases' had now  been  superseded.
    However it was repeated in similar words at 20,  giving  the  Court  of
    Appeal's concluded view on the law as it now stands:

       The  authorities  to  which  I  have  referred  support  the  general
       proposition that great importance is to be attached to the  right  of
       free movement which can be interfered with only in  cases  where  the
       offender represents a serious threat to some aspect of public  policy
       or public  security.  Save  in  exceptional  cases,  that  is  to  be
       determined solely by reference to the conduct  of  the  offender  (no
       doubt viewed in the  context  of  any  previous  offending)  and  the
       likelihood of re-offending. General considerations of deterrence  and
       public revulsion normally have no part to  play  in  the  matter.  In
       these respects the principles governing the  deportation  of  foreign
       criminals in general differ significantly from those which govern the
       deportation of EEA nationals who have acquired a permanent  right  of
       residence.

31. While that passage does refer  to  those  with  a  permanent  right  of
    residence, as with the appellants in Straszewski, where serious grounds
    of public policy are required, the principle itself must be the same in
    a case of this kind, where they need not be serious in  the  same  way.
    Other than in exceptional cases, the decision must be based  solely  on
    the conduct of the person concerned,  which  must  itself  represent  a
    genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat  to  society,  without
    taking into account deterrence or other general considerations, and not
    relying solely on a conviction against him.

32. Conclusions     While the Lithuanian court order says nothing about the
    facts behind the appellant's main offence, the ineluctable  element  of
    it, from his point of view, is that he  ended  with  a  conviction  for
    intentional murder against him. Intention to cause grievous bodily harm
    might, as in this country, have been enough, though there is  no  point
    in speculating about Lithuanian criminal law. What is certain  is  that
    some deliberate (in the sense of intended) act on the appellant's  part
    must have  been  necessary.  I  cannot  accept  the  submission  in  Mr
    Nicholson's skeleton  (not  renewed  in  oral  argument,  following  an
    indication from me) that the conviction should be treated as if it were
    capable of being reduced to manslaughter by reason of loss of  control,
    under the present criminal law of England and Wales.



33. On the other hand, it is open to me to accept the appellant's  evidence
    that the murder happened in the context of a spur of the  moment  fight
    between young men of similar ages. This was not challenged, and  I  see
    no reason not to do so. In those circumstances, I see no reason  either
    for dealing with this case as an exception to the general rule set  out
    in reg. 21 (5), and I have to answer the question that poses.

34. While the appellant has been unable to accept, from his  own  point  of
    view, the full facts behind his 1997 conviction for intentional murder,
    human nature, law-abiding as well as  criminal,  leads  us  to  take  a
    better view of our own actions than the truth might  justify.  He  does
    accept that the Lithuanian Court of Appeal's  decision  represents  the
    authoritative view on what happened. His statement of 8 April 2016  was
    clearly professionally  taken,  but  not  necessarily  by  someone  who
    realized  the  importance  of  the  difference   between   murder   and
    manslaughter in English law, though the distinction between  'incident'
    and 'accident' should have been  more  obvious.  The  Lithuanian  court
    order was put before Judge Beg at the same time, and there was  clearly
    no intention to mislead her  by  the  way  in  which  the  offence  was
    described.

35. As for propensity to violence, the appellant's own version of the facts
    behind his 1996 conviction for 'hooliganism' does suggest that  he  may
    have been ready to resort to his fists when  provoked;  but  I  do  not
    think it can indicate any inherent propensity to cause death or serious
    harm; nor does the drugs conviction.

36. While the appellant did break the  terms  of  his  licence  by  leaving
    Lithuania in 2004, he was clearly aware of the need  for  him  to  find
    work, in which he succeeded throughout his two stays in  this  country,
    till detained. After he was released once again in 2009,  he  kept  the
    terms of his licence by not leaving again till 2011,  and  had  clearly
    learnt his lesson about that.

37. It is clear from the Lithuanian court  order  that  the  terms  of  the
    licence required no  formal  rehabilitation:  while  that  might  be  a
    significant gap where the offence showed some inherent propensity which
    needed to be specifically addressed, I do not think it  can  reasonably
    be held against this appellant in a  case  where  he  has  been  in  no
    trouble for any kind of violence at all, in or out of prison, for  very
    nearly 20 years.

38. Returning to the appellant's attitude to his offence, in his  statement
    he certainly put a more favourable construction on it than the terms of
    his final conviction would justify. However,  he  has  always  accepted
    that he is responsible for causing someone's  death,  which  cannot  be
    excused. Significantly, it was in answer to cross-examination (see  27)
    that he expressed concern for the young man who "... should have  lived
    and had a family and enjoyed his life, but lost everything".  I  regard
    that sign of some empathy as both spontaneous and genuine.

39. In the circumstances, I regard  the  appellant's  two  decades  without
    resort to violence of any kind as a strong indication that his personal
    conduct does not now represent a  'genuine,  present  and  sufficiently
    serious threat' to society's fundamental interest in keeping the peace.
    It might have been otherwise in a murder  case  with,  for  example,  a
    sexual, political or ulterior criminal propensity; but there is nothing
    like that here.

40. The result is that this appeal is allowed: as the Court of Appeal  made
    clear in  Straszewski  (see  30),  the  result  would  have  been  very
    different in a case which did not involve an EEA citizen; but  that  is
    who I am dealing with.
