                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is a challenge by the Appellant against the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal (Judges Loke and Neville - "the panel"),  promulgated  on
    17 December 2018, in which it dismissed the Appellant's appeal  against
    the Respondent's decision of 14 February 2018.   This  refusal  was  in
    relation to a human rights claim made on 25 November 2016.  That  claim
    was predicated upon the Appellant's assertion that he  had  resided  in
    the United Kingdom on a continuous lawful basis for ten  years.   This,
    he said, would  make  it  disproportionate  to  remove  him  from  this
    country.  In refusing the claim the Respondent relied on  discrepancies
    in the Appellant's earnings as between those set out in an  application
    for further leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  1  (General)  Migrant  (the
    application having been made on 30 March 2011) and  those  declared  to
    HMRC at the relevant time. The discrepancies related in  particular  to
    claimed earnings from self-employment.  The Respondent  concluded  that
    the  discrepancies  were  on  account  of  dishonest  conduct  by   the
    Appellant.  In light of this, para. 322(5)  of  the  Immigration  Rules
    applied, with the consequence that  the  Appellant  could  not  succeed
    under the Rules, on the basis of suitability.  Further, there  were  no
    exceptional circumstances requiring a  grant  of  leave  on  Article  8
    grounds outside of the context of the Rules.

The panel's decision

 2. Having set out background to the appeal, at para. 16 of  its  decision,
    the panel said the following:

         "In the Tier 1 application of 30 March 2011, the appellant  claimed
         to have an income  of  �36,822.71.   These  earnings  comprised  of
         �6,425.71 from employment and �30,397.00 from self employment.  For
         the same period, the appellant  declared  �3,382.00  in  income  to
         HMRC.  Plainly this is a  substantial  difference.   The  appellant
         failed to pay any tax for 2010-2011, and failed to amend this until
         2016, a significant length of time later."

 3. The panel took the view  that  this  state  of  affairs  permitted  the
    Respondent to discharge the evidential burden of raising  an  issue  of
    deception against the Appellant.  The panel then turned to the question
    of whether the Appellant had provided an innocent explanation.  It made
    reference to the decision of Khan (Dishonesty,  tax  return,  paragraph
    322(5)) [2018]  UKUT  00384  (IAC)  (the  guidance  in  Khan  has  been
    approved, subject to one particular modification by the Court of Appeal
    in Balajigari [2019] WLR(D) 232).

 4. At para. 20 the panel  sets  out  its  reasons  for  finding  that  the
    Appellant had failed to provide an  innocent  explanation  such  as  to
    satisfy the minimum level of plausibility.  In the circumstances, it is
    appropriate to set these reasons out in full:

         "a)  The appellant had settled his accounts for 2010-2011.  This is
             clear from the fact that he submitted his accounts to the Home
             Office for the Tier 1 application.  Therefore  he  would  have
             been aware of his  earnings  and  have  expected  to  pay  tax
             thereon;

         b)   Aspire accountants have provided no documentation  to  explain
             or admit any error;

         c)   There  is  no  evidence  of  any  correspondence  between  the
             appellant and Aspire accountants, which  we  would  expect  to
             exist in  these  circumstances,  to  support  the  appellant's
             account that he had  confronted  Aspire  Accountants  when  he
             realised they had failed to submit his tax;

         d)   The  appellant  failed  to  take  any  action  against  Aspire
             accountants when a significant error was claimed to have  been
             discovered by him.  Given Aspire accountants completely failed
             to carry out the service they had been  paid  to  do  for  the
             Appellant, with severe consequences, we  would  have  expected
             the appellant to have taken some action.  At the very least we
             would have expected a complaint to have been made to  them  in
             writing.  The appellant's explanation for failing to complain,
             namely that he had no  proof  against  Aspire  accountants  is
             simply not correct.  The Appellant had the  accounts  prepared
             by  Aspire  accountants,  and  the  records  from  HMRC  which
             indicated there was no SA02 (sic) for the year 2010-2011;

         e)   The appellant has taken steps to make the amendment in his tax
             return, and we are aware that he is paying the required tax in
             instalments.  However, the amendment was not made until 2016;

         f)   The fact that the appellant was going through a busy period in
             his life in 2010-2011 may have excused his failure to remember
             that he had to pay tax in the short  term.   However,  in  our
             view this does not excuse his failure to recall his  liability
             for five years.  The appellant's tax liability  the  following
             year 2011-2012 was �1,500.00.  In that year he  only  declared
             �14,492.00 from employment, less than half the income received
             in 2010-2011.  If the failure to submit a tax return for 2010-
             2011 was simply an error, we would have expected the following
             tax  year's  liability  to  have  triggered  the   appellant's
             recollection that he had not paid any tax the preceding  year,
             despite having earned over  twice  as  much  income.   In  the
             circumstances (sic) do  not  find  his  explanation  for  this
             significant delay to be a satisfactory one."

 5. On the basis of these reasons the panel concluded  that  the  Appellant
    had been "deceitful and dishonest".  It also found that the  dishonesty
    related  to  the  Appellant's  dealings  with  HMRC  and  not  to   the
    Respondent.  It was said that the  Appellant's  conduct  engaged  para.
    322(5) of  the  Rules  and  this,  when  taken  in  the  context  of  a
    consideration of all other relevant factors including  the  Appellant's
    family life in the United Kingdom, led to the ultimate conclusion  that
    Article 8 would not be breached by the  refusal  of  the  human  rights
    claim.



The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

 6. The grounds of appeal are focused on  two  particular  points.   First,
    that when setting out what was said to be  a  material  aspect  of  its
    reasoning in para. 20(f), the panel confused the way in which tax  paid
    on earnings from employment with that in which it is paid  on  earnings
    from self-employment.  In respect of the former, tax  was  deducted  at
    source through PAYE, whilst in the latter  it  was  calculated  on  the
    basis of a tax return and was paid in one or  two  lump  sums  (usually
    January and July in any given year).  The grounds assert that the panel
    appeared to proceed under the misapprehension that the  nature  of  the
    payment of tax and liabilities was the same for both types of earnings.
     Second, it is said that the panel failed to consider a letter from the
    Appellant's new accountants which supported his case that he  had  been
    unaware of the failures of his previous accountants until  the  problem
    was uncovered by the new accountants in 2016.

 7. Permission to appeal on both grounds  was  granted  by  Upper  Tribunal
    Judge Clive Lane on 10 June 2019.



The hearing

 8. It is right to say that at the hearing before me there was a degree  of
    discussion and cogitation as to the precise meaning of para.  20(f)  of
    the panel's decision.  In summary, Mr Gajjar, in line with the  grounds
    of appeal, submitted that the panel had not compared like with like  as
    regards the source of the earnings and the  nature  of  the  manner  in
    which tax liabilities arising from employment and  self-employment  are
    paid.  He submitted that the confusion  was  material  as  para.  20(f)
    represented an important aspect of the panel's reasoning on the serious
    issue of the Appellant's dishonesty.  He also submitted that a  failure
    to consider the new accountants' letter was material in that it went to
    underpin the  Appellant's  assertion  that  whilst  he  may  have  been
    careless in the past, he had not practised deception.

 9. Ms Cunha  submitted  that  on  a  proper  reading  of  para.  20(f)  in
    conjunction with para. 20(a), the panel  was  essentially  saying  that
    because the Appellant had had to pay tax on the employed income in 2011-
    2012, he should have realised that he was due to pay  tax  on  earnings
    from the previous year where he had earned more  than  twice  as  much,
    albeit most of that emanating from self-employment.

10. At the end of the hearing I reserved my decision.



Decision on error of law

11. Not without a degree of hesitation, and having considered  the  panel's
    decision holistically, I conclude that it contains two material  errors
    of law.

12. The first relates to para. 20(f).  Whilst Ms Cunha's interpretation  of
    this important aspect of the panel's reasoning was not without merit, I
    have come to the conclusion that Mr Gajjar's reading of  it  is  to  be
    preferred.

13. The first point to make is that at the beginning of that  sub-paragraph
    the panel indicate that the Appellant's busy lifestyle at the  relevant
    time "may have excused his failure to remember that he had to  pay  tax
    in the short term".  What led to the  panel's  conclusion  against  the
    Appellant was his failure to have subsequently appreciated that he  had
    not paid any tax for the 2010-2011 tax year.  It is  correct  that  the
    Appellant had earned over twice as much in that  tax  year  as  in  the
    subsequent tax year of 2011-2012. However, there had been an  important
    (and undisputed) change in the Appellant's circumstances: he had  moved
    from having earnings derived largely  from  self-employment  with  some
    from employment in the previous tax year, to deriving  earnings  solely
    from employment in the next tax year.  It is the case that tax  due  on
    employed earnings is deducted at source through PAYE: thus, there is no
    tax return and  no  consequent  communication  from  HMRC  of  any  tax
    liability. It follows that the rationale that the employed earnings and
    the  tax  due  therefrom  should   have   triggered   the   Appellant's
    recollection  is  undermined.   In  short  terms,  the  panel  was  not
    comparing 'like with like' in terms of the nature of the  earnings  and
    how tax liabilities arising therefrom differed.

14.  I have of course considered paragraph 20(f)  in  the  context  of  the
    other reasons provided by the panel.  Paragraph 20(a) is relevant.   On
    the face of it, it provides a good reason for why the Appellant  should
    have realised that there would be tax payable for the earnings obtained
    in 2010-2011.  On the other hand,  this  point  needs  to  be  seen  in
    context of what the panel then said at the beginning of paragraph 20(f)
    in respect of the Appellant  being  busy  and  that  this  had  perhaps
    provided an excuse for a failure to remember to pay tax in  the  "short
    term".

15. The reasons set out in 20(b)-20(d) relate to the  Appellant's  original
    accountants Aspire Accountants. Those reasons have not been  challenged
    and they were clearly open to  the  panel  on  the  evidence  (or  more
    specifically the lack thereof).

16. In my view, if, as I find it does, paragraph 20(f)  contains  erroneous
    reasoning, and that  passage  were  to  be  excised  from  the  panel's
    findings as a whole,  it  cannot  be  said  that  the  outcome  on  the
    important issue of dishonesty would inevitably have been the same.  The
    omission of paragraph 20(f) could  have  made  a  material  difference.
    This is particularly so  in  view  of  the  fact  that  the  panel  was
    primarily concerned with the question  of  whether  the  Appellant  had
    provided an innocent  explanation,  satisfying  the  minimal  level  of
    plausibility.  In other words, the threshold was not especially high.

17. There is a material error of law here.

18. I turn to the issue of the letter from the Appellant's new accountants.
     This ground of challenge does not  carry  the  same  strength  as  the
    first. Nonetheless, it is the case that the panel did not consider this
    item of evidence.   On  its  face,  the  letter  indicates  that  these
    accountants had "uncovered" the error in relation to the tax return for
    2010-2011.  Whilst in no way decisive, it did lend some credence to the
    Appellant's assertion that whilst he may have  been  careless/negligent
    in respect of the 2010-2011 tax return, he may not have been dishonest.
     I also consider that the accountants' letter was potentially  relevant
    to the question of the delay between the  relevant  tax  year  and  the
    amendments made in 2016, with reference  to  what  the  panel  said  at
    paragraph 20(e) of its decision. This is an additional material error.

19. On the basis of the above, I conclude that the panel's decision must be
    set aside.



Disposal

20. In respect of the disposal of this appeal, Ms Cunha expressed the  view
    that this matter should be retained in the Upper  Tribunal  for  a  re-
    making decision to be made in due course.  Mr Gajjar submitted that  in
    view of the nature of the Appellant's case and any errors going to  the
    question of credibility (which of course incorporates dishonesty on the
    Appellant's part), this case  should  be  remitted  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

21. Remitting a case is very much the exception  to  the  presumption  that
    matters should be re-decided in the Upper Tribunal.  I have had  regard
    to paragraph 7.2 of the Practice Statement.  This is a case which in my
    view requires remittal to the First-tier Tribunal.

22. The question of the Appellant's  conduct  is  quintessentially  one  of
    credibility.  The errors I have identified go  to  the  heart  of  that
    issue.  The effect of the errors is that none of the  panel's  findings
    can stand. Therefore, what is now required is a wholesale revisiting of
    all  relevant  matters,  chief  amongst  them  the  question   of   the
    Appellant's alleged dishonesty. That requires fact-finding followed  by
    an assessment of his Article 8 case within the context of the Rules and
    without.
