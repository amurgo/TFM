                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Iran  born  in  1986.  He  appeals  with
    permission against the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge
    Bannerman) to dismiss his appeal on protection grounds.

    Basis of the Protection Claim

 2. When the Appellant arrived in the United Kingdom and claimed asylum  in
    April 2019 the basis of his claim was as follows.

 3. As a conscript in the Iranian army in 2008 the Appellant  was  given  a
    flash drive by a  friend  which  contained  irreverent  caricatures  of
    Iranian political leaders. On the day that the Appellant was  returning
    it to its owner he was approached by the Commander of the barracks. The
    Commander confiscated the drive. Nothing  happened  until  four  months
    later the Appellant was abducted by Ettelaat officers who  put  him  in
    the boot of a car and took him to an unknown place. He was interrogated
    and tortured over a three-week period. At one point the  owner  of  the
    flash drive was brought into the Appellant's  room  and  the  Appellant
    told his friend to confess to its ownership - he told him that  he  had
    "told everything". In the  meantime  the  Appellant's  family  home  in
    Tehran was raided. The Ettelaat found coins and artefacts from the time
    of the Shah. The Appellant was told that these things demonstrated that
    he was "pro-tyrant" - after that he  was  transferred  to  an  official
    detention  centre  and  the  torture  got  worse.  The  Appellant   was
    interrogated about whether he belonged to a political opposition group.
     The Ettelaat had also confiscated a 'Turksat' satellite receiver  from
    the Appellant's home, which they claimed was a "sender".  They  accused
    him of using this equipment to broadcast offensive  images  of  Iranian
    leaders.  The Appellant was released after the intervention of a family
    friend who had connections with  the  government.  He  was  sent  to  a
    barracks far from Tehran, near the Iraqi border, where  he  served  the
    remaining 6 months of his military service.  After this  the  Appellant
    was allowed to return home. This incident was  relied  upon  as  giving
    important background to the  risk  of  harm  currently  feared  by  the
    Appellant.

 4. Ten years later the Appellant was working in  central  Tehran,  selling
    tools. In June 2018 a series of demonstrations took place in the  area,
    with people protesting about the economic situation in  Iran.   Traders
    in  the  bazaar  closed  their  shops   and   started   to   join   the
    demonstrations.  The Appellant took  part,  and  took  footage  on  his
    mobile telephone.  Police  and  plain  clothes  officers  attacked  the
    protestors, trying to disperse the crowds by  beating  people  up.  The
    protests died  down  after  three  days  when  senior  members  of  the
    judiciary made an announcement  saying  that  anyone  caught  attending
    would be executed.

 5. In July 2018 the Appellant found that his laptop was malfunctioning. He
    had a friend who worked in IT and he asked him to have a  look  at  it.
    The friend identified that it wasn't  a  software  problem.  It  was  a
    hardware issue and he would need to take the computer to  someone  else
    for them to fix  it.  Shortly  after  this  the  Appellant  received  a
    telephone call from his friend who told him that his  laptop  had  been
    confiscated by the authorities. The Appellant knew that the footage  of
    the protests was on his laptop. He became afraid and  immediately  went
    into hiding. He was with a friend on a farm in Shahryar when  he  found
    out that his home in Tehran had been raided. His wife, and then  a  few
    days later his parents, were taken in for questioning.   The  Appellant
    spoke to members of his family who urged him to leave the  country.  An
    uncle made the arrangements and  he  left,  crossing  the  border  into
    Turkey.

 6. The basis of the Appellant's claim was therefore that he faced a  well-
    founded fear of persecution  in  Iran  for  reasons  of  his  political
    opinion. The footage of the protests found on  his  laptop  established
    that he had been on the demonstration.  In  light  of  the  Appellant's
    history as perceived by Iran's internal intelligence agency, there  was
    additionally a danger that he might be accused of holding  the  footage
    for the purpose of creating anti-state propaganda.

 7. The Respondent accepted that if all of this  was  true,  the  Appellant
    would face a real risk of serious harm if returned to Iran  today.  The
    claim was however refused on the grounds that the account  was  untrue.
    This was the matter in issue before the First-tier Tribunal.

    The Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

 8. The First-tier Tribunal concluded that it did not find the Appellant to
    be credible. At its �59 it said:

         "He was stumbling in his evidence  and  was  completely  unable  to
         explain why on the one hand he had said that had met his friend  in
         custody face to face from at first and then later said  he  hadn't.
         His evidence was confused and incredible. There was also the  issue
         at the screening  interview  of  saying  that  he  had  never  been
         effectively in custody and that  he  had  not  been  in  the  armed
         services, both of which he later turned completely around on"

 9. It went on to find, in respect of both of the incidents described, that
    they "simply didn't ring true".   The appeal was accordingly dismissed.

    Error of Law: Discussion and Findings

10. The Appellant was granted permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal by
    Upper Tribunal Judge Kamara on the 6th April 2020.  The  grounds  raise
    several points but this is in essence a reasons challenge.

11. I have summarised the Appellant's evidence as I have at �3-6  above  to
    illustrate two things.

12. First, that it is helpful, at the outset of any  protection  claim,  to
    understand what the basis of the claim is. Anyone reading this decision
    can understand the Appellant's claims, both about past events  in  Iran
    and about his future fears. The same cannot be said for the  reader  of
    the First-tier Tribunal  decision.  That  begins  by  setting  out  the
    Respondent's case, before going on to summarise what  I  assume  to  be
    evidence given under cross-examination.  Whilst it cannot be said  that
    this was a  structural  failing  amounting  to  an  error  of  law,  it
    certainly  makes  the  decision  very  difficult  to  read.   A   clear
    understanding of the Appellant's case - rather than the reasons that it
    has been refused - should be the starting point of any  decision.  This
    will assist the decision  maker  in  understanding  the  evidence,  the
    points made in favour and against, and in contextualising any issue  of
    law. Here it is alleged that the Tribunal  has  become  confused  about
    what the evidence actually was, and absent any defined summary  of  his
    case that is hard to gainsay.

13. The alleged confusion arises at paragraph 59 of the decision,  set  out
    at my �8 above. Although this is not identified in  the  decision,  the
    parties agree that the Tribunal must have been referring to the alleged
    incident when the Appellant was detained in 2008.  The  Tribunal  found
    that the Appellant was "completely unable to explain  why  on  the  one
    hand he had said that had met his friend in custody face to  face  from
    at first and then later said he hadn't". Mrs Johnrose submits that  the
    Tribunal  is  entirely  mistaken  in  finding  contradiction   in   the
    Appellant's evidence. The evidence given at  the  asylum  interview  on
    this point appears at Q94-98 of the  transcript.  The  Appellant  there
    describes how officers brought his  friend  (the  owner  of  the  flash
    drive) into the interrogation room and how he told his friend to  admit
    that the drive was his. Under  cross-examination  at  the  hearing  the
    Appellant was asked whether his friend  was  there  when  he  had  told
    officers that the drive belonged to him. The  Appellant  said  that  he
    was. The Appellant was then asked "did he ever admit  it  was  his"  to
    which the Appellant replied "I kept repeating this during  questioning.
    I never saw (my  friend)  again".   Mrs  Johnrose  submits,  with  good
    reason, that  the  evidence  given  by  the  Appellant  at  his  asylum
    interview, and at the hearing, was in fact the same. The Appellant  did
    not deny that he saw his friend whilst being held in detention - indeed
    he had confirmed that this was the case. At its highest all that can be
    said about his final response was that it was  not  an  answer  to  the
    question put: if the Appellant did not know whether his friend made any
    admissions, he should simply have said so.

14. The second reason that I have set out the evidence of the Appellant  as
    I have is in order to illustrate that even reduced to  its  most  basic
    elements, it is an  account  that  contains  significant  vignettes  of
    detail, for instance the confiscation of the  'pro-tyrant'  coins  from
    the time of the Shah. Such  details  are  of  little  assistance  to  a
    Tribunal in evaluating future risk, but they are  certainly  worthy  of
    some attention  when  it  comes  to  deciding  whether  this  story  is
    reasonably likely to be true.  There  is  no  such  evaluation  in  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal. The very brief findings consist of
    no more than the judge finding that the evidence did not have the "ring
    of truth" about it. That is not adequate reasoning.  Whilst  there  may
    not be error in the phrase itself, it is without more  meaningless.  If
    the judge meant to convey that he found the account  to  be  inherently
    implausible, either by reference to the country background material  or
    as a matter of logic, he should have said so and explained why.  As  it
    is the matters that are mentioned as weighing against the Appellant are
    left entirely unexplained. For instance,  the  Judge  finds  it  to  be
    "incredible" that the Appellant's friend would call  him  to  tell  him
    that the laptop had been confiscated. Neither  the  Appellant,  nor  I,
    have any idea why that might be "incredible".  That  is  a  conclusion,
    not reasoning.

15. The final point made by Mrs Johnrose is that the Tribunal has failed to
    take material evidence into account. At its �59 the Tribunal notes that
    the Appellant replied "no" when  asked  during  the  screening  process
    whether he had completed military service or ever been detained.  Those
    replies being at  variance  with  the  Appellant's  case  as  it  later
    emerged, the Tribunal drew adverse  inference  from  those  them.  Even
    taking into account the guidance in YL (rely on SEF) China [2004] UKIAT
    00145, that it was entitled to do.  What it was not entitled to do  was
    to completely ignore the Appellant's subsequent  explanations  for  the
    answers he gave, set out in his witness statement dated  the  29th  May
    2019, his asylum interview on the 7th August 2019 and in a letter  from
    those representing him on the 20th August 2019.   Where  claimants  are
    not read back screening interview  records,  and  where  they  have  no
    independent interpreter present, their subsequent  clarifications  must
    as a matter of fairness be taken into account.

16. I am accordingly satisfied that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal
    is flawed for material errors of law  and  I  set  it  aside.   In  the
    circumstances the parties agreed that the most just  disposal  at  this
    stage would be remittal for hearing de novo in the First-tier  Tribunal
    by any judge other than Bannerman.

    Anonymity Order

17. This appeal concerns a claim for protection.  Having had regard to Rule
    14 of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  and  the
    Presidential Guidance Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity Orders  I  therefore
    consider it appropriate to make an order in the following terms:

         "Unless and until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
         Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
         shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his
         family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
         Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
         direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"

    Decisions

18. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains material error of
    law and it is set aside.

19. The matter is remitted for hearing de novo in the  First-tier  Tribunal
    by a Judge other than Judge Bannerman.

20. There is an order for anonymity.
