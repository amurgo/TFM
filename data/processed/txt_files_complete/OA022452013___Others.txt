Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr M Karnik instructed by Binas Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr G Harrison, Senior Presenting Officer



                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellants,  who  are  mother  and  daughters,  have  been  granted
    permission to appeal the decision of First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Lever,
    who for reasons  given  in  his  determination  dated  1  October  2013
    dismissed their appeals against the Entry Clearance Officer's decisions
    dated 26 November 2012 refusing their applications  to  settle  in  the
    United Kingdom with the first appellant's  husband  Tony  Murinzi  (the
    sponsor) and three of their five children, the second, third and fourth
    appellants. The appellants are nationals of Rwanda where they live.

 2. The sponsor and first appellant have two  sons  living  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  As with their father, they were born in Rwanda and joined him
    here in December 2002. The eldest  was  born  in  March  1996  and  the
    younger in October 1998.  The sponsor had fled  the  country  in  April
    2001.  He was granted exceptional leave to remain that  year.   He  and
    his sons were granted indefinite leave to remain in  October  2008  and
    were naturalised as British citizens in October 2011.

 3. The first, second and third appellants were previously  in  the  United
    Kingdom between 2003 and 2005 when they were  administratively  removed
    to Rwanda.  The sisters were born in November 1994  and  October  1998.
    Their mother was born in August 1971.  The fourth appellant was born in
    the UK in January 2004.  The sponsor visited his family  in  Rwanda  in
    March 2012 for just over two weeks.

 4. The first appellant's application was refused under  paragraph  320(11)
    of the Rules on the basis of deception practised  previously  when  she
    applied for leave to remain in December  2003.   The  validity  of  the
    marriage  was  not  accepted  based  on  concerns  about  the  marriage
    certificate and furthermore it was not accepted that  the  relationship
    was genuine and  subsisting  or  that  the  parties  intended  to  live
    together permanently in the United Kingdom.

 5.  The  application  was  additionally  refused  with  reference  to  the
    financial requirements in Appendix FM based on a failure to submit  the
    required documentation to demonstrate the threshold  of  �24,800.   The
    Entry Clearance Officer was also concerned  that  there  would  not  be
    adequate accommodation without recourse to public funds.

 6. The third and fourth appellant's applications were rejected because the
    Entry Clearance Officer was not satisfied as to the relationship and it
    was not accepted that the financial requirements had been met.

 7. Although it is not a matter which appears to have  been  raised  before
    the First-tier Tribunal or indeed before  me,  the  second  appellant's
    application was refused with reference to paragraph 297 rather than the
    requirements in Appendix FM introduced  on  9  July  2012.   The  Entry
    Clearance Officer had found no trace of the applications by the  first,
    third and fourth appellants. He also noted the  timing  of  the  second
    appellant's application, three  days  before  her  18th  birthday.   He
    therefore refused it on the basis that there was no evidence  that  her
    mother was being admitted to the  United  Kingdom  for  settlement  and
    accordingly did not accept that the  provisions  of  paragraph  297  in
    respect of sole responsibility had been met nor that there was evidence
    of compassionate circumstances.   The  adequacy  of  accommodation  and
    financial provision was also rejected with reference  to  the  relevant
    subparagraphs of 297 and in addition Article 8.

 8. Paragraph 297 is under part 8  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   Paragraph
    A280(b) provides that inter alia paragraphs  297  to  230  continue  to
    apply to all  applications  made  on  or  after  9  July  2012.   These
    paragraphs apply in their current form unless an additional requirement
    by reference to Appendix FM  is  specified.   There  is  no  additional
    requirement in relation to paragraph 297.

 9. The error by the Entry Clearance Officer in applying paragraph 297  was
    that the second appellant was not seeking leave to enter in any of  the
    circumstances  in  paragraph  297(i).   Specifically  in   respect   of
    paragraph 297(i)(e), the sponsor has not had  sole  responsibility  for
    the second  appellant's  upbringing  or  that  there  are  serious  and
    compelling family or other considerations which make exclusion  of  the
    second appellant undesirable.

10. The grounds  of  appeal  relating  to  the  second  appellant  make  no
    reference to the nature of the decision but  I  do  not  consider  this
    aspect has any material bearing on the case.

11. A consequence of this aspect however  is  that  the  appeals  proceeded
    before the First-tier Tribunal Judge based on a misapprehension  as  to
    the funding  requirements  under  Appendix  FM.   The  first  appellant
    correctly indicated in her application she needed to  demonstrate  with
    reference to the three accompanying children an income  before  tax  by
    the sponsor of at least �27,200 a year and not the lesser sum  referred
    to in the decisions by the ECO relating to the other appellants.   Here
    again I do not consider anything material turns on this aspect;  it  is
    accepted that the appellants are unable to meet the requirements of the
    rules even based on the lower sum.  It is odd that the  point  was  not
    picked up but it has no bearing on my enquiry into whether  the  First-
    tier Tribunal erred in law.

12. In dismissing the appeals Judge Lever reached these conclusions:

      i) The case was not appropriate for refusal under paragraph 320(11).

     ii) The decision of the Administrative Court in  MM  [2013]  EWHC  1900
         does  not  provide  a  basis  for  the  Immigration  Rules  to   be
         disregarded.  This was the extent of the judge's findings under the
         Rules.

    iii) As to Article 8 -

          a) family life existed between the first  appellant  and  sponsor
             and between  him  and  the  appellant  children  and  the  two
             siblings living in the United Kingdom;

          b) the Entry Clearance Officer's decision did not interfere  with
             the current or previous family life of the parties  living  in
             separate countries for the previous twelve years;

          c) the decision interfered with the future and "more  integrated"
             family life if the only reasonable place to  enjoy  that  life
             was in the United Kingdom;

          d)  such  interference  was  lawful  and  by  implication  for  a
             legitimate aim;

          e) in the context of the proportionality exercise, there  was  no
             evidence as to  specific  difficulties  or  adversity  in  any
             aspects of the children's lives either in Rwanda or the United
             Kingdom;

          f) of the children in the United Kingdom, one  was  17  and  soon
             therefore to pass into adulthood;

          g) there were no "obvious fetters or bars" to the sponsor and the
             boys in the UK moving to Rwanda.  The bar  to  the  appellants
             moving to the United Kingdom was their  failure  to  meet  the
             Immigration Rules;

          h) no evidence had been provided to demonstrate that in acquiring
             British citizenship the parties had been forced to  relinquish
             their Rwandan nationalities;

          i) the sponsor had recently been in Rwanda and had not  expressed
             any concerns or worries regarding the situation for himself or
             family there;

          j) the natural inference was  that  the  best  interests  of  the
             children were to live with both parents, nothing indicating on
             balance that those best interests were served by  their  being
             together in the United Kingdom rather than in Rwanda;

          k) there was nothing inherently unreasonable in the  sponsor  and
             his sons if they were moving to Rwanda to unite the family.

     Thus with the above matters taken into account the judge decided  that
     the interference was proportionate.

13. The renewed grounds of application rely on the  grounds  raised  before
    the First-tier Tribunal.  The first was that it was necessary  for  the
    First-tier Tribunal to decide as a separate step whether  EX.1  of  the
    Immigration Rules applied and whether it was reasonable to  expect  the
    children to leave the United Kingdom.  The failure  to  do  so  was  an
    error.

14. The second ground argues that the Tribunal erred in its approach to the
    evaluation of proportionality as to what could reasonably  be  expected
    of British children under Article 8.  Reference  is  made  to  Campbell
    (exclusion; Zambrano) Jamaica [2013] UKUT  147  (IAC)  and  MA  and  SM
    (Zambrano: EU children outside EU) Iran [2013] UKUT  380.   The  latter
    cases cited were a specific reference to the concession  on  behalf  of
    the Secretary of State by  Mr  Deller.   It  is  also  argued  that  in
    assessing Article 8 the Tribunal had failed to recognise the  "European
    dimension" despite the  submissions  before  it.   The  further  ground
    advanced is that the Tribunal had failed to consider the relevance of R
    (MM) v SSHD [2013] EWHC 1990 (Admin) with reference  to  the  sponsor's
    employment earning �15,000 per year and savings in an account  of  some
    �17,500.

15. The renewed grounds raise again the application of  the  Administrative
    Court's decision in MM.  It is also argued that the treatment of the UK
    children's British citizenship by the Tribunal had been an  error  with
    reference to the judge's expectation that they should leave the  United
    Kingdom and the European Union in order to live together as  a  family.
    The concept of voluntary return can have no part to play where children
    are concerned.

16. I am grateful to the parties for their submissions. They  were  focused
    on the relevance of the British citizenship of the two sons  living  in
    the United Kingdom to the judge's findings that it would be  reasonable
    for them to  relocate  with  reference  to  the  Secretary  of  State's
    concession on this aspect.

17. I heard no submissions on the first ground regarding the application of
    EX.1.  This is misconceived.  In order to succeed under s.E-ECPT of  FM
    the first appellant  would  need  to  demonstrate  that  she  had  sole
    responsibility or that the parent with whom the child lives must not be
    the partner of the applicant.   EX.1  is  of  no  application  in  such
    circumstances.

18. It was the decision in MM coupled with the fact  of  the  split  family
    that led UTJ Goldstein to grant permission  to  appeal.  The  Court  of
    Appeal has overturned that decision and clarified in MM &  Ors,  R  (On
    the Application Of) v SSHD that  the  new  minimum  income  requirement
    provisions were capable of being compatible with Article  8  rights  of
    the UK partners and others if relevant. This  disposes  of  the  second
    ground.

19.  I  turn  to  the  third  ground  which  is  the   challenge   to   the
    proportionality exercise.  In my view the grounds conflate the Zambrano
    principles with the Article 8 considerations.  As was made clear in  MA
    and SM, such principles involve distinct different enquiries. There  is
    no question in this case that the two sons in the United  Kingdom  were
    compelled by the Entry Clearance Officer's decision to leave the United
    Kingdom with their primary carer who was himself  compelled  to  leave.
    They are all British citizens and under no such compulsion.

20. The proportionality enquiry is a separate one.  Having  regard  to  the
    facts of this case, I am persuaded that the judge erred when he  sought
    to resolve the tension between the family life of the parties  and  the
    public interest  in  maintaining  immigration  control  by  finding  it
    reasonable for the two sons  in  the  United  Kingdom  to  relocate  to
    Rwanda.  Although  their  recently  acquired  British  citizenship  has
    limited relevance, the fact of their physical presence  in  the  United
    Kingdom since 2002 makes it difficult to see how it is  reasonable  for
    them to return to a country which they have  only  visited  once  since
    they came to the United Kingdom at a young age.

21. The question I need to ask is whether the  error  is  material.  It  is
    evident from my reading of the determination that  the  judge  did  not
    find the proportionality exercise an easy one.  In my view the approach
    to proportionality must be through the reality of the  situation;  this
    family has lived apart except for a brief period since 2002.  The  only
    bar to reunification is an inability to meet the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  There  is  nothing  in  the  circumstances  of  the
    parties, taking account of the length of time they have been separated,
    to demonstrate that there is a compelling feature that could render the
    interference occasioned by the decisions under appeal disproportionate.
    The sons have flourished in the UK.  There  is  no  evidence  that  the
    children in Rwanda have needs that cannot be met by a  continuation  of
    the arrangements that have  prevailed  for  some  years.  There  is  no
    indication that their mother is unable to care for them.

22. The best interests of the children which are a  primary  consideration.
    They should be together as a family unit as found by  the  judge.  Such
    interests are of less  force  however  in  the  light  of  the  lengthy
    separation. The natural  desire  of  this  family  to  be  reunited  is
    understandable  but  best  interests  do   not   always   dictate   the
    proportionality outcome.  The appellants in this case have not shown  a
    compelling case for reunification notwithstanding an inability to  meet
    the requirements of the rules. As the financial  circumstances  of  the
    sponsor improve it will be open to the appellants to re-apply for entry
    clearance.

23. Although I am persuaded that the judge  erred  in  the  proportionality
    exercise I consider that on the evidence, there is no  realistic  basis
    on which the appeal could succeed. The decision dismissing the  appeals
    does not require to be set aside and therefore stands.

24. These appeals are dismissed.
