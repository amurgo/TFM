Anonymity
Rule 14: The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
Although an anonymity order was not made  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  as
this is a protection claim, it is appropriate to make  that  order.   Unless
and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise, the  Appellant  is  granted
anonymity. No report of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or  indirectly
identify him or any member of his family. This  direction  applies,  amongst
others, to both parties. Failure to comply with this  direction  could  lead
to contempt of court proceedings.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the decision  of  us  all.  The  section  dealing  with  the
       applicable burden and standard of proof  was  primarily  written  by
       Lane J and the remainder of the decision was written by  UTJ  Smith.
       The part of the decision setting out the submissions made concerning
       the facts of the case was drafted shortly after the hearing.


    BACKGROUND


    2. The Appellant appeals against  a  decision  of  First-Tier  Tribunal
       Judge A K Hussain promulgated on 1 February  2018  ("the  Decision")
       dismissing the Appellant's appeal against the Secretary  of  State's
       decision dated 5 December 2017 refusing his protection claim.


    3. The Appellant is a national of Iran born on 12 September  1999.   He
       claims to have arrived in the UK clandestinely in January 2017.   He
       claimed asylum on 7 January 2017.  At that time, he was a minor  but
       at the time of the Respondent's decision and the hearing before  the
       First-tier Tribunal he was aged eighteen.

    4.  The  Appellant's  claim  of  the  Iranian  authorities  stems  from
       association with his father who he says is a high-ranking member  of
       the Kurdish Democratic Party ("KDP").  He  says  that  his  father's
       name was disclosed to the authorities by a girl  who  worked  within
       the KDP and knew his father.  She disclosed his  father's  identity,
       the Appellant says, when  she  was  detained  and  tortured  by  the
       authorities.

    5. In addition to his father's role in the KDP, the Appellant says that
       his father was a smuggler of goods banned  in  Iran.   He  does  not
       claim  that  his  father  came  to  the  adverse  attention  of  the
       authorities on that account.  The Appellant says that he accompanied
       his father on at least ten smuggling trips but did not himself  come
       to the adverse attention of the authorities.

    6. The Judge did not accept that the Appellant's father is or ever  was
       a member of the KDP, that he was a  high-ranking  official  in  that
       party or that he was of adverse interest  from  the  authorities  on
       that account ([24] of the Decision).  The Judge rejected a claim  of
       any wider risk arising from the Appellant's illegal exit  from  Iran
       or his failed asylum claim.

    7. The Appellant seeks permission  to  appeal  on  three  grounds.   In
       summary form, those are that the Judge applied the wrong burden  and
       standard  of  proof,  that  the  Judge   ignored   the   Appellant's
       vulnerability as a child with regard  to  a  material  part  of  the
       evidence and that  the  Judge  failed  to  identify  the  background
       material on which reliance was placed  in  support  of  the  Judge's
       finding that the claim was inconsistent with the way  in  which  the
       Iranian authorities conduct themselves.

    8. Permission to  appeal  was  granted  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
       Birrell on 4 March 2018 in the following terms (so far as relevant):

            "...[3]    The grounds challenge that the Judge failed to  take
           into account the Appellants age in assessing the significance of
           the discrepancies between the various  accounts  he  gave.   The
           Judge identified in paragraph 1 the fact that the Appellant  was
           a minor at the  time  of  the  events  outlined,  the  Screening
           interview and the SEF but was  an  adult  at  the  time  of  his
           witness statement and the hearing and that he 'made  appropriate
           allowances' but it is  arguable  that  he  failed  to  make  any
           reference to the Appellant's age thereafter when  assessing  the
           evidence and therefore what 'allowances' he made.  There  is  no
           reference to specific background material  in  relation  to  the
           assessment of the activities of the Etalaat. There is less force
           in ground one but all grounds may be argued.
            [4]  The grounds disclose arguable errors of law."


    9. The matter comes before us to decide whether the Decision contains a
       material error of law and, if we so find, either to re-make the
       Decision ourselves or remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal to
       do so.

    DECISION AND REASONS


    Ground One: The Burden and Standard of Proof in Article 3 claims

   10. An appellant in a human rights appeal who asserts that  his  or  her
       removal from the United Kingdom would violate Article 3 of the  ECHR
       must establish that claim. In other words, the appellant  bears  the
       burden of proof.  The standard of proof requires  the  appellant  to
       show a "reasonable likelihood" or "real risk" of Article 3 harm.

   11. The Immigration Appeal Tribunal  so  held  in  Kacaj  (Article  3  -
       Standard of Proof - Non-State Actors) Albania*  [2001]  UKIAT  00018
       ("Kacaj").  At paragraph [12] of its  determination,  the  IAT  said
       that "the standard may be a relatively low one, but it  is  for  the
       applicant to establish his claim to that standard".

   12. Section 107(3) and (3A) of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum
       Act 2002 ("the 2002 Act") provides  that  practice  directions  made
       under section 23 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement  Act  2007
       may require the First-tier Tribunal and the Upper Tribunal to  treat
       a specified decision  of,  amongst  other  bodies,  the  Immigration
       Appeal Tribunal, as authoritative in respect of a particular matter.



   13. Practice Direction 12 of the Immigration and Asylum Chambers of  the
       First-tier Tribunal and the Upper Tribunal provides that a  reported
       determination of, inter alia, the IAT which is  "starred"  shall  be
       treated as authoritative in respect  of  the  matter  to  which  the
       "starring" relates, unless inconsistent with other authority that is
       binding on the Tribunal.

   14. It is undisputed that  Kacaj  is  "starred"  for  what  it  says  in
       paragraph 12 of the determination.  There is no  domestic  case  law
       that is inconsistent with Kacaj.  On the contrary, the higher courts
       consistently follow the same approach.  Thus,  for  example,  in  AM
       (Zimbabwe) and Another v Secretary of State for the Home  Department
       [2018] EWCA Civ 64, Sales LJ held:-

         "16.     It is common ground that where a foreign national seeks to
             rely upon Article 3 as an answer to an attempt by a  state  to
             remove him into another country, the overall legal  burden  is
             on him to show that Article 3 would be infringed in  his  case
             by showing that there are substantial  grounds  for  believing
             that he would face a real risk of being subject to torture  or
             to inhuman or degrading treatment in that other country ..."

   15. In the light of this, Mr Bedford  accepts,  as  he  must,  that  the
       Appellant has a burden to discharge. He submits, however, that  what
       he describes as  the  "standard  direction  on  appeal  against  the
       refusal of an international protection claim" needs modification  in
       order to take account of what he says is the "clear and  consistent"
       line that has emerged from the European Court of Human Rights in the
       past decade. In this regard, Mr Bedford places  particular  reliance
       upon the judgment of the Grand Chamber in JK  and  Others  v  Sweden
       (Application no. 59166/12) ("JK"), given on 23 August 2016.

   16. According to Mr Bedford, JK holds that the burden on applicants  for
       international protection is discharged  when  they  adduce  evidence
       which is "capable of proving" a real risk on return.  At this point,
       the burden  shifts  to  the  government  to  dispel  any  doubts  or
       uncertainty.

   17. Mr Bedford further submits that:-

         "Any new or modified direction in the Tribunal on  the  burden  and
         standard of proof must take account of the effect  of  the  Supreme
         Court decision in R (Kiarie); R (Byndloss) v SSHD ...  [2017]  UKSC
         42 at [54], [35] that for the purposes of section 82 [of  the  2002
         Act] any proposed appeal must  be  taken  to  be  arguable  in  the
         absence of a certificate that it is clearly unfounded."

   18. The "hard" form  of  Mr  Bedford's  submission  (to  adopt  his  own
       description) is, accordingly, that whenever the  respondent  decides
       not to certify  a  human  rights  claim  (at  least,  one  involving
       international  protection),  that  claim  must,  logically,  involve
       "evidence capable of proving" the appellant's case, with the  result
       that the ensuing appeal is one in which the  respondent  necessarily
       bears the burden of dispelling "any doubts about it".

   19. To use again Mr Bedford's terminology, the "softer" version  of  his
       submission acknowledges that, even where a claim is not certified as
       clearly unfounded, the appellant may, in certain circumstances, bear
       the burden of proof throughout.  However, as we understand  him,  Mr
       Bedford submits that an appellant whose case is not confined to  his
       or her own statements but  is  supported  by  documentary  or  other
       evidence,  has  discharged  the  burden,  so  that  it  is  for  the
       respondent to dispel any doubts or uncertainty.  Mr Bedford  relies,
       in this regard,  on  Article  4.5  of  the  Qualification  Directive
       (Council Directive 2004/83/AEC).

    Article 4(5) of the Qualification Directive

   20. Article 4 of the Directive provides as follows:-

         "Article 4


         Assessment of facts and circumstances


          1. Member States may consider it the duty  of  the  applicant  to
             submit as soon as possible all elements needed to substantiate
             the application for international protection.  In  cooperation
             with the applicant it is the  duty  of  the  Member  State  to
             assess the relevant elements of the application.


          2. The elements  referred  to  in  paragraph  1  consist  of  the
             applicant's  statements   and   all   documentation   at   the
             applicant's   disposal   regarding   the   applicant's    age,
             background, including that of  relevant  relatives,  identity,
             nationality(ies),  country(ies)  and  place(s)   of   previous
             residence,  previous  asylum  applications,   travel   routes,
             identity and travel documents and the reasons for applying for
             international protection.


          3. The assessment of an application for international  protection
             is to be carried out  on  an  individual  basis  and  includes
             taking into account:

               a) all relevant facts as they relate to the country of origin
                  at the time of  taking  a  decision  on  the  application;
                  including laws and regulations of the  country  of  origin
                  and the manner in which they are applied;


             (b) the relevant statements and documentation presented by the
                  applicant including information on whether  the  applicant
                  has been or may be subject to persecution or serious harm;


             (c) the individual position and personal circumstances of  the
                  applicant, including factors such  as  background,  gender
                  and age, so as to assess whether,  on  the  basis  of  the
                  applicant's personal circumstances, the acts to which  the
                  applicant has been or could be  exposed  would  amount  to
                  persecution or serious harm;


             (d) whether  the  applicant's  activities  since  leaving  the
                  country of origin were engaged in for  the  sole  or  main
                  purpose of creating the necessary conditions for  applying
                  for international protection,  so  as  to  assess  whether
                  these activities will expose the applicant to  persecution
                  or serious harm if returned to that country;


             (e) whether the applicant  could  reasonably  be  expected  to
                  avail himself of the protection of another  country  where
                  he could assert citizenship.


         4.  The  fact  that  an  applicant  has  already  been  subject  to
             persecution or serious harm  or  to  direct  threats  of  such
             persecution or such harm,  is  a  serious  indication  of  the
             applicant's well-founded fear of persecution or real  risk  of
             suffering serious harm,  unless  there  are  good  reasons  to
             consider that such persecution or serious  harm  will  not  be
             repeated.

         5. Where Member States apply the principle according to which it is
             the duty of the applicant to substantiate the application  for
             international protection and where aspects of the  applicant's
             statements are not supported by documentary or other evidence,
             those aspects shall not need confirmation, when the  following
             conditions are met:


             (a) the applicant has made a genuine  effort  to  substantiate
                  his application;


               b) all relevant elements, at the applicant's  disposal,  have
                  been submitted, and a satisfactory  explanation  regarding
                  any lack of other relevant elements has been given;

             (c)  the applicant's statements are found to be  coherent  and
                  plausible and do not run counter to available specific and
                  general information relevant to the applicant's case;


             (d)  the applicant has applied for international protection at
                  the earliest  possible  time,  unless  the  applicant  can
                  demonstrate good reason for not having done so; and


             (e)   the  general  credibility  of  the  applicant  has  been
                  established." (our emphasis)

   21. Article 4(5) is  given  direct  effect  in  the  United  Kingdom  by
       paragraph 399L of the Immigration Rules:-

         "339L    It is the duty of the person to  substantiate  the  asylum
                claim or establish that  they  are  a  person  eligible  for
                humanitarian protection or substantiate their  human  rights
                claim.  Where aspects of the  person's  statements  are  not
                supported by documentary or other  evidence,  those  aspects
                will  not  need  confirmation  when  all  of  the  following
                conditions are met:

                (i)    the person has made a genuine effort to  substantiate
                    their asylum claim or establish that they are  a  person
                    eligible for humanitarian protection or substantiate his
                    human rights claim;

                (ii)   all material factors at the  person's  disposal  have
                    been submitted, and a satisfactory explanation regarding
                    any lack of other relevant material has been given:

                (iii)  the person's statements are found to be coherent  and
                    plausible and do not run counter to  available  specific
                    and general information relevant to the person's case;

                (iv)   the person has made an  asylum  claim  or  sought  to
                    establish  that  [they  are]  a  person   eligible   for
                    humanitarian protection or made a human rights claim  at
                    the  earliest  possible  time,  unless  the  person  can
                    demonstrate good reason for not having done so; and

                (v)    the  general  credibility  of  the  person  has  been
                    established."

    The UNHCR Note on the Burden and Standard of Proof

   22. As we shall see, Article 4 was considered by the ECtHR  in  JK.   So
       too was the UNHCR Note on Burden and Standard of  Proof  in  Refugee
       Claims, where we find the following :-

         "6.      According to  general  legal  principles  of  the  law  of
             evidence, the burden of proof lies on the person who makes the
             assertion.  Thus, in refugee claims, it is the  applicant  who
             has  the  burden  of  establishing  the  veracity  of  his/her
             allegations and the accuracy of the facts on which the refugee
             claim is based.  The burden of  proof  is  discharged  by  the
             applicant rendering a truthful account of  facts  relevant  to
             the claim so that, based on the facts, a proper  decision  may
             be reached.  In view  of  the  particularities  of  a  refugee
             situation, the adjudicator shares the duty  to  ascertain  and
             evaluate all the relevant facts.  This is achieved, to a large
             extent, by the adjudicator being familiar with  the  objective
             situation in the country of origin concerned, being  aware  of
             relevant matters of common knowledge, guiding the applicant in
             providing the relevant information  and  adequately  verifying
             facts alleged which can be substantiated.

         ...

         10.       As  regards   supportive   evidence,   where   there   is
             corroborative  evidence  supporting  the  statements  of   the
             applicant, this would reinforce the veracity of the statements
             made.  On the other  hand,  given  the  special  situation  of
             asylum-seekers, they should not be  required  to  produce  all
             necessary evidence.  In particular, it  should  be  recognised
             that, often, asylum-seekers  would  have  fled  without  their
             personal documents.  Failure to produce  documentary  evidence
             to substantiate oral statements should, therefore, not prevent
             the  claim  from  being  accepted  if  such   statements   are
             consistent with known facts and the general credibility of the
             applicant is good.

         11.      In assessing the overall credibility  of  the  applicant's
             claim, the adjudicator should take into account  such  factors
             as the  reasonableness  of  the  facts  alleged,  the  overall
             consistency  and   coherence   of   the   applicant's   story,
             corroborative evidence adduced by the applicant in support  of
             his/her  statements,  consistency  with  common  knowledge  or
             generally known facts and the known situation in  the  country
             of origin.  Credibility is established where the applicant has
             presented  a  claim  which  is  coherent  and  plausible,  not
             contradicting generally known  facts,  and  therefore  is,  on
             balance, capable of being believed.

         12.      The term 'benefit of the doubt' is used in the context  of
             standard of proof relating to the factual assertions  made  by
             the applicant.  Given that in  refugee  claims,  there  is  no
             necessity for the applicant to  prove  all  facts  to  such  a
             standard that the adjudicator  is  fully  convinced  that  all
             factual assertions  are  true,  there  would  normally  be  an
             element of doubt in the mind of the adjudicator as regards the
             facts  asserted  by  the  applicant.   Where  the  adjudicator
             considers that the applicant's story is on the whole  coherent
             and plausible, any element of doubt should not  prejudice  the
             applicant's claim; that is, the applicant should be given  the
             'benefit of the doubt'."

     Strasbourg case law

   23. The first applicant in JK was a citizen of Iraq who claimed to be in
       need of international protection, but whose claim  was  rejected  by
       Sweden on the basis that he had not shown that he was at  real  risk
       of serious harm in Iraq, were he to be returned  there.   The  ECtHR
       referred to Saadi v Italy (Application no. 31201/06) as stating that
       the relevant standard of proof in Article 3 cases of  this  kind  is
       whether "substantial grounds have been shown for believing that  the
       person in question, if deported, would face a  real  risk  of  being
       subjected to treatment contrary to  Article  3  in  the  destination
       country".

   24. Paragraphs 91 to 98 of the judgment in JK need to be set out in full
       :-

         "91.     Regarding the burden of proof in expulsion  cases,  it  is
             the Court's well-established case-law that it is in  principle
             for the applicant to adduce evidence capable of  proving  that
             there are substantial  grounds  for  believing  that,  if  the
             measure complained of were to be implemented, he or she  would
             be exposed to a real risk  of  being  subjected  to  treatment
             contrary to  Article  3;  and  that  where  such  evidence  is
             adduced, it is for the Government to dispel any  doubts  about
             it (see F.G. v. Sweden, cited above, � 120;  Saadi  v.  Italy,
             cited above, � 129; NA. v. the United Kingdom, cited above,  �
             111; and R.C. v. Sweden, cited above, � 50).

         92.      According to the Court's  case-law,  it  is  incumbent  on
             persons who allege that their  expulsion  would  amount  to  a
             breach  of  Article  3  to  adduce,  to  the  greatest  extent
             practically possible, material and  information  allowing  the
             authorities of the Contracting State concerned, as well as the
             Court, to assess the risk a removal may entail  (see  Said  v.
             the Netherlands, no. 2345/02, � 49, ECHR 2005-VI).  The Court,
             however,  acknowledges  the   fact   that   with   regard   to
             applications for recognition of  refugee  status,  it  may  be
             difficult, if not impossible,  for  the  person  concerned  to
             supply evidence  within  a  short  time,  especially  if  such
             evidence must be obtained from the country from  which  he  or
             she claims to have  fled.   The  lack  of  direct  documentary
             evidence thus cannot be decisive per se (see Bahaddar  v.  the
             Netherlands, 19 February 1998,  �  45,  Reports  1998-I,  and,
             mutatis mutandis, Said, cited above, � 49).

         93.      Owing to the special  situation  in  which  asylum-seekers
             often find themselves, it is frequently necessary to give them
             the benefit of the doubt when  assessing  the  credibility  of
             their  statements  and  the  documents  submitted  in  support
             thereof. Yet when information is presented which gives  strong
             reasons  to  question  the  veracity  of  an   asylum-seeker's
             submissions,  the  individual  must  provide  a   satisfactory
             explanation for the alleged inaccuracies in those  submissions
             (see F.G. v. Sweden, cited above, � 113; Collins and Akaziebie
             v. Sweden (dec.), no. 23944/05, 8 March 2007;  and  S.H.H.  v.
             the United Kingdom, no. 60367/10,  �  71,  29  January  2013).
             Even if the applicant's account of  some  details  may  appear
             somewhat implausible, the Court has considered that this  does
             not necessarily detract from the overall  general  credibility
             of the applicant's claim (see Said, cited above,  �  53,  and,
             mutatis mutandis, N. v. Finland, no. 38885/02, �� 154-155,  26
             July 2005).


         94.      As a general rule, an  asylum-seeker  cannot  be  seen  as
             having discharged the burden of proof until he or she provides
             a substantiated account of an individual,  and  thus  a  real,
             risk of ill-treatment upon  deportation  that  is  capable  of
             distinguishing his or her situation from the general perils in
             the country of destination.


         95.      Moreover, although a number of individual factors may not,
             when considered separately, constitute a real risk,  the  same
             factors may give rise to a real risk when  taken  cumulatively
             and when considered in a situation  of  general  violence  and
             heightened security (see NA.  v.  the  United  Kingdom,  cited
             above, � 130).  The following elements may represent such risk
             factors: previous criminal record and/or arrest  warrant,  the
             age, gender and origin of a returnee, a previous record  as  a
             suspected or actual  member  of  a  persecuted  group,  and  a
             previous asylum claim submitted abroad (see NA. v. the  United
             Kingdom, cited above, �� 143-144 and 146).


         96.      The Court notes that it is the shared duty of  an  asylum-
             seeker  and  the  immigration  authorities  to  ascertain  and
             evaluate  all  relevant  facts  of  the  case  in  the  asylum
             proceedings.  Asylum-seekers are normally the only parties who
             are able to  provide  information  about  their  own  personal
             circumstances.   Therefore,   as   far   as   the   individual
             circumstances are concerned, the burden  of  proof  should  in
             principle lie on the applicants, who must submit, as  soon  as
             possible,  all   evidence   relating   to   their   individual
             circumstances that is needed to substantiate their application
             for  international  protection.   This  requirement  is   also
             expressed both in the UNHCR documents (see paragraph 6 of  the
             UNHCR Note on Burden and Standard of Proof in  Refugee  Claims
             and paragraph 196 of the  UNHCR  Handbook  and  Guidelines  on
             Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee  Status,  both
             referred to in paragraphs 53-54 above) and in Article 4 � 1 of
             the EU Qualification Directive, as well as in  the  subsequent
             case-law of the CJEU (see paragraphs 47 and 49-50 above).


         97.      However, the rules concerning the burden of  proof  should
             not render ineffective the applicants' rights protected  under
             Article 3 of the Convention.  It is  also  important  to  take
             into account all the difficulties which an  asylum-seeker  may
             encounter abroad when collecting evidence (see Bahaddar, cited
             above � 45, and, mutatis mutandis, Said, cited above,  �  49).
             Both the standards developed by the UNCHR (paragraph 12 of the
             Note  and  paragraph  196  of  the  Handbook,  both  cited  in
             paragraphs 53-54 above) and Article 4 � 5 of the Qualification
             Directive  recognise,  explicitly  or  implicitly,  that   the
             benefit of the  doubt  should  be  granted  in  favour  of  an
             individual seeking international protection.


         98.      The Court notes that, as far  as  the  evaluation  of  the
             general situation  in  a  specific  country  is  concerned,  a
             different approach  should  be  taken.   In  respect  of  such
             matters, the domestic  authorities  examining  a  request  for
             international protection have full access to information.  For
             this  reason,  the  general  situation  in  another   country,
             including the ability of its  public  authorities  to  provide
             protection,  has  to  be  established  proprio  motu  by   the
             competent  domestic  immigration  authorities  (see,   mutatis
             mutandis, H.L.R. v. France, cited above, �  37;  Hilal,  cited
             above, � 60; and Hirsi Jamaa and Others, cited above, �  116).
             A similar approach is advocated in paragraph 6 of  the  above-
             mentioned Note issued by the UNHCR,  according  to  which  the
             authorities adjudicating on an asylum claim have to take  "the
             objective situation in the country of origin  concerned"  into
             account proprio  motu.   Similarly,  Article  4  �  3  of  the
             Qualification Directive requires that "all relevant  facts  as
             they relate to the country of origin" are taken into account."

   25. At paragraph 102, the ECtHR considered the significance of past ill-
       treatment:-

         "102.    The court considers that the fact  of  past  ill-treatment
                provides a strong indication  of  a  future,  real  risk  of
                treatment contrary to  Article  3,  in  cases  in  which  an
                applicant has made a generally coherent and credible account
                of events that is consistent with information from  reliable
                and objective sources about the  general  situation  in  the
                country at issue.  In such circumstances, it will be for the
                government to dispel any doubts about that risk."

   26. At paragraph 106, having noted that the existence of a risk of  ill-
       treatment, so far as the  ECtHR  was  concerned,  must  be  assessed
       primarily with reference to the facts known or which ought  to  have
       been known to the Contracting State at the time  of  expulsion,  the
       court nevertheless noted that, since the applicants had not yet been
       deported, "the question whether they  would  face  a  real  risk  of
       persecution upon their return to Iraq must be examined in the  light
       of the present day situation".

   27. The ECtHR then embarked on that task.  It could see  "no  reason  to
       cast doubt on the [Swedish] Migration  Agency's  findings  that  the
       family have been exposed to the most serious forms of abuses ...  by
       Al-Qaeda from  2004  to  2008"  (paragraph  114).   The  applicants'
       account of what happened  between  2004  and  2010  was,  the  ECtHR
       considered, "generally coherent and credible" and  "consistent  with
       the relevant Country of Origin Information".  This meant that it was
       "therefore for the government to dispel any doubts about that  risk"
       (paragraphs 114, 115).

   28. Looking at the most  recent  objective  international  human  rights
       sources, the ECtHR considered that there were deficits in  both  the
       capacity and integrity  of  the  Iraqi  security  and  legal  system
       (paragraph 120) and that, overall, there was a real  risk  that  the
       Iraqi state would not be able to protect the applicants.

   29. That was the majority view of the ECtHR, reached  by  ten  votes  to
       seven.  Judge Ranzoni, in  a  dissenting  opinion,  considered  that
       paragraph 102 of the majority judgment lacked  sufficient  reasoning
       and diverged from Article 4.4 of the Qualification  Directive  in  a
       number of respects.

   30. RC v Sweden (Application no. 41827/07) is a judgment  of  the  third
       section of the ECtHR.  It  concerned  an  individual,  RC,  who  was
       present in Sweden  and  claimed  to  be  in  need  of  international
       protection from the authorities in Iran.  Before the First  Instance
       Migration Court in Sweden, the credibility of RC was examined.   Two
       of the three judges of that Court found RC's account was incredible;
       but one dissented from that conclusion.

   31. At paragraph 50 of  its  judgment,  the  ECtHR  noted  that  it  was
       "frequently necessary to give" asylum seekers the  "benefit  of  the
       doubt" when it comes to  assessing  credibility  of  statements  and
       documents; but that when there were "strong reasons to question  the
       veracity of an asylum  seeker's  submissions,  the  individual  must
       provide a satisfactory explanation for the alleged discrepancies".

   32. Beginning at paragraph 52, the ECtHR began  its  own  assessment  of
       RC's credibility.  It noted that one of the Migration  Court  judges
       had considered the applicant to have given  a  credible  account  of
       events.  The ECtHR found that a medical certificate put  before  the
       Migration Board gave a "rather strong indication to the  authorities
       that the applicant's scars and injuries may have been caused by ill-
       treatment or torture" and that, in the circumstances, it was for the
       Board "to dispel any doubts that might  have  persisted  as  to  the
       cause of such scarring".  The ECtHR held that the Board should  have
       "directed that an expert opinion be  obtained  as  to  the  probable
       cause of the applicant's scars".

   33. The court came to the conclusion that  the  applicant  had  given  a
       credible account and was at real risk if returned to Iran.

   34. In a dissenting opinion, Judge Fura said he was not  convinced  that
       the applicant had made out a prima facie case, even having regard to
       the  medical  certificate.   Judge  Fura  did  not  agree  that  the
       certificate meant the authorities should  have  directed  an  expert
       opinion to be obtained.  On the contrary, Judge Fura said he  "would
       be reluctant to give  any  specific  instructions  to  the  domestic
       authorities as to what procedural measure  to  take  and  even  less
       willing to advise on what conclusions to draw from certain  evidence
       introduced in a case where I have not had the benefit of seeing  the
       parties and in which the relevant events  took  place  a  long  time
       ago".

   35. In FG v Sweden (Application no. 43611/11), a judgment of  the  Grand
       Chamber given on 23 March 2016, the ECtHR had this  to  say  on  the
       burden of proof:-

         "120.    Regarding the burden of proof, the Court found in Saadi v.
             Italy (cited above, �� 129-32; see also, among others, Ouabour
             v. Belgium, no. 26417/10, � 65, 2 June 2015  and  Othman  (Abu
             Qatada) v. the United Kingdom, no. 8139/09, � 261,  ECHR  2012
             (extracts)), that it was in principle  for  the  applicant  to
             adduce evidence capable of proving that there were substantial
             grounds for believing that, if the measure complained of  were
             to be implemented, he would be exposed to a real risk of being
             subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3; and  that  where
             such evidence was adduced, it was for the Government to dispel
             any doubts raised by it (ibid., � 129). In order to  determine
             whether there is a  risk  of  ill-treatment,  the  Court  must
             examine the foreseeable consequences of sending the  applicant
             to the  destination  country,  bearing  in  mind  the  general
             situation there and his personal circumstances (ibid., � 130).
              Where the sources available describe a general situation,  an
             applicant's specific allegations in a particular case  require
             corroboration by other evidence  (ibid.,  �  131).   In  cases
             where an applicant alleges that he or she is  a  member  of  a
             group systematically exposed to a practice  of  ill-treatment,
             the Court considers that the protection of Article  3  of  the
             Convention enters into play when  the  applicant  establishes,
             where necessary on the basis of the  above-mentioned  sources,
             that there are serious reasons to believe in the existence  of
             the practice in question and in his or her membership  of  the
             group concerned (ibid., � 132)."

   36.  Applying  this  approach  to  the  facts  of  FG,  who  had  sought
       international  protection  in  Sweden  alleging  a   fear   of   the
       authorities in Iran (both as regards  alleged  political  activities
       and because of a sur place conversion to  Christianity),  the  ECtHR
       held that the Swedish authorities had not erred in  their  approach.
       FG's application was, accordingly, dismissed.

   37. In MA v Switzerland (Application no.  52589/13),  a  second  section
       judgment handed down on 18 November 2014, the ECtHR placed  emphasis
       on the fact  that  neither  the  Migration  Board  nor  the  Federal
       Administrative Court of Switzerland had challenged the  authenticity
       of a court summons, originating  in  Iran,  put  forward  by  MA  in
       connection with his protection claim.  Having carried  out  its  own
       analysis,  the  ECtHR  concluded  that  the  applicant  had  adduced
       evidence capable of proving that there were substantial grounds  for
       believing that, if expelled, he would be at real risk of  Article  3
       ill-treatment and that he "must be given the benefit  of  the  doubt
       with regard to the remaining uncertainties.  The government  on  the
       other hand have not dispelled any doubts that  the  applicant  would
       face such treatment" (paragraph 69).

   38. Judge Kj�lbro gave a dissenting opinion.  He said that an assessment
       of the credibility of a claimant's  account  "is  an  essential  and
       important element in the processing of asylum cases.   This  is,  in
       many cases, a difficult exercise in which many factors  have  to  be
       taken into account" (paragraph 2).

   39. At paragraph 4, Judge Kj�lbro said:

           "Owing to the risk of abuse of the asylum system and  fabricated
           stories from asylum seekers, who have  often  been  assisted  by
           professional  human  traffickers  deriving   profit   from   the
           desperate situation of vulnerable individuals, it is  legitimate
           for asylum authorities to submit the  account  given  by  asylum
           seekers to  a  thorough  examination  in  order  to  assess  the
           credibility of their statements.  In doing so it  is  important,
           amongst other things, to ascertain whether the account given  by
           the asylum seeker, in particular concerning the core elements of
           the motives for seeking asylum, is consistent and coherent."

   40. Judge Kj�lbro noted that the Migration Board had had the benefit  of
       seeing the applicant in person "which is  an  important  element  in
       assessing the reliability of an asylum seeker's motives"  (paragraph
       5).  The authorities in Switzerland considered  that  the  applicant
       had not  given  a  plausible  explanation  for  inconsistencies  and
       discrepancies.  Judge Kj�lbro considered that  the  majority  judges
       were "acting as  a  "fourth  instance"  in  its  assessment  of  the
       reliability of the applicant's statements" (paragraph 6).

   41. He also found that the  importance  attached  to  documents  by  the
       majority was problematic" in that:-

           "It is well-known in asylum cases that it is often easy  to  get
           hold of forged and fraudulently obtained official documents  ...
           If the account given by an asylum seeker is credible,  documents
           in support of the statement are often of  less  importance.   On
           the other hand, if the account given  by  an  asylum  seeker  is
           clearly unreliable, documents will frequently  be  incapable  of
           dispelling the doubts concerning its credibility." (paragraph 7)

   42. Judge Kj�lbro concluded by saying that, in his view,  having  regard
       to the "subsidiary role of the court", the majority had not given  a
       "sufficient basis for overturning the  assessment  of  the  domestic
       authorities as regards the credibility  of  the  applicant's  asylum
       story".

   43. In Paposhvili v Belgium (Application  no.  41738/10),  given  on  13
       December 2016, the Grand Chamber of the ECtHR examined the threshold
       in an Article 3 case, involving a claim by a person that  to  remove
       him from Belgium would lead to a real risk  of  serious  harm  as  a
       result of a deterioration  in  his  medical  condition,  where  that
       condition could not be said to be attributable to the authorities of
       the country to which he was proposed to be returned.

   44. We are not here concerned with that aspect of the judgment.  Rather,
       Mr Bedford draws attention to paragraphs 186 and 187, which  contain
       what, by now, can be seen to be standard  statements  of  the  ECtHR
       regarding the burden of proof :-

         "186.    In  the  context  of  these  procedures,  it  is  for  the
             applicants to adduce evidence capable  of  demonstrating  that
             there are substantial  grounds  for  believing  that,  if  the
             measure complained of were to be implemented,  they  would  be
             exposed to  a  real  risk  of  being  subjected  to  treatment
             contrary to Article 3 (see Saadi, cited above, � 129, and F.G.
             v. Sweden, cited above, � 120).  In this connection it  should
             be observed that a certain degree of speculation  is  inherent
             in the preventive purpose of Article 3 and that it  is  not  a
             matter of requiring the persons  concerned  to  provide  clear
             proof of their claim that they would be exposed to  proscribed
             treatment  (see,  in  particular,  Trabelsi  v.  Belgium,  no.
             140/10, � 130, ECHR 2014 (extracts)).

         187.     Where such evidence is adduced, it is for the  authorities
             of the returning State, in the context of domestic procedures,
             to dispel any doubts raised by it (see Saadi, cited  above,  �
             129, and F.G. v.  Sweden,  cited  above,  �  120).   The  risk
             alleged must be subjected to close scrutiny (see Saadi,  cited
             above, � 128; Sufi  and  Elmi  v.  the  United  Kingdom,  nos.
             8319/07 and 11449/07, � 214, 28 June  2011;  Hirsi  Jamaa  and
             Others, cited above, � 116; and Tarakhel, cited above, �  104)
             in the course of which the authorities in the returning  State
             must consider the foreseeable consequences of removal for  the
             individual concerned in the receiving State, in the  light  of
             the general situation  there  and  the  individual's  personal
             circumstances (see Vilvarajah and Others, cited above, �  108;
             El-Masri, cited above, � 213; and  Tarakhel,  cited  above,  �
             105).  The assessment  of  the  risk  as  defined  above  (see
             paragraphs 183-84)  must  therefore  take  into  consideration
             general  sources  such  as  reports  of   the   World   Health
             Organisation or of  reputable  non-governmental  organisations
             and  the  medical  certificates  concerning  the   person   in
             question."

   45. We have already observed that, in paragraph 16 of the  judgments  in
       AM (Zimbabwe), Sales LJ stated that the overall legal burden  is  on
       an applicant for international protection relying upon Article 3  to
       show that there are substantial grounds for  believing  that  person
       would face a real risk of being subjected to treatment  contrary  to
       that Article, in the event of  removal.   Sales  LJ  then  said  the
       following :-

         "In Paposhvili, at paras. [186] - [187] ... the  Grand  Chamber  of
         the ECtHR has given guidance how he may achieve that, by raising  a
         prima facie case of infringement of Article 3 which  then  cast  an
         evidential burden onto the defending  state  which  is  seeking  to
         expel him."

    Discussion

   46. It is trite law that the obligation of courts and tribunals  in  the
       United Kingdom is to "take into account any ... judgment,  decision,
       declaration or advisory opinion  of  the  European  Court  of  Human
       Rights ..." (section 2(1)(a)) of the Human Rights Act 1998).  United
       Kingdom courts and tribunals should, however, generally  follow  any
       clear and consistent approach of the ECtHR (particularly, of course,
       its Grand Chamber).  However, that will not be the position  if  and
       in so far as the domestic court or tribunal in question is bound  by
       the principle of stare decisis to follow the decision  of  a  higher
       court  or  tribunal,  even  though  this  may  be  contrary  to  the
       Strasbourg approach: Kay v London Borough of Lambert [2006] UKHL 10.

   47. It is quite clear from RC v Sweden (paragraph 50) and  FG  v  Sweden
       (paragraph 120) that JK v Sweden introduces no new approach  to  the
       issue of the burden of proof in Article 3 cases.  The requirement of
       a government to dispel doubts, where an applicant  adduces  evidence
       "capable  of  proving"  that  there  are  substantial  grounds   for
       believing expulsion would violate Article 3, has been a  feature  of
       the ECtHR jurisprudence for some considerable time.

   48. Whilst that means, of course, that Strasbourg has indeed  maintained
       a consistent approach over a significant period of time, Mr  Bedford
       must face the question of why, if his interpretation of the  ECtHR's
       approach is correct, the startling consequences for  United  Kingdom
       immigration law and, no doubt, much of the law of  other  EU  States
       have not been identified before now.

   49. The fact of the matter is, we find, that there is  no  justification
       for Mr Bedford's contention that evidence  "capable  of  proving"  a
       claim  constitutes  the  same  or  even  a  similar  threshold   for
       determining whether a claim is so lacking  in  substance  as  to  be
       clearly unfounded within the terms of section 94 of the 2002 Act.

   50.  In JK, the ECtHR  cited  (without  evident  disapproval)  both  the
       passages from the UNHCR guidance on the benefit of the doubt,  which
       we  have  set  out  above,  and  also  certain  provisions  of   the
       Qualification Directive  including,  importantly,  Article  4.   The
       UNHCR Note does not say the burden always shifts to  the  government
       in question except where the claim is, on any  view,  hopeless.   We
       shall have more to say on Article 4 of the  Qualification  Directive
       in a moment; but, for the present, we observe that Article  4.5,  on
       its face,  shares  nothing  in  common  with  Mr  Bedford's  primary
       submission.

   51. Accordingly, if Mr  Bedford's  primary  or  "hard"  submission  were
       right, we would expect to see the majority of the  ECtHR  explaining
       why they had seen fit to depart from both the UNHCR Note and Article
       4 of the Qualification Directive.  However, one looks  in  vain  for
       any such explanation.

   52.  It  is  manifest  from  the  ECtHR's  analysis  of   the   personal
       circumstances of the applicants in JK,  which  begins  at  paragraph
       112, that the applicants had,  according  to  the  majority  of  the
       court, produced strong  or  compelling  evidence  of  real  risk  on
       return.  In particular, emphasis was placed by the majority upon the
       findings of the Migration Agency that JK's family had  been  exposed
       to "the most serious forms of  abuses"  by  Al-Qaeda  and  that  the
       latter's  threats  had  continued  after  2008.   Furthermore,  JK's
       account was "consistent with relevant Country of Origin  information
       available from reliable and objective sources" (paragraph 114).

   53. It was on this basis that the majority of the  court  concluded,  at
       paragraph [115], that it was for the Swedish  Government  to  dispel
       any doubts about the risk to the applicants.  Even  so,  however,  a
       violation of Article 3 was found by only ten votes to seven.

   54. RC v  Sweden  was  not  a  Grand  Chamber  case.   In  reaching  its
       conclusion on credibility, the majority of the ECtHR  was  impressed
       by a medical report, which said that RC had been tortured.

   55. When national courts and tribunals are considering  cases  in  which
       the ECtHR decides to embark on its own fact-finding exercise, it  is
       important to ensure that the ECtHR's  factual  conclusions  are  not
       treated as general principles of human rights law and practice.

   56. Indeed, judicial conclusions of fact will often have little light to
       shed on those  general  principles,  for  the  simple  reason  that,
       whatever standard of proof is in play,  it  is  quite  possible  for
       different judges to reach different but  valid  conclusions  on  the
       same  evidence.  We  see  this  graphically  demonstrated   in   the
       dissenting judgments recorded above.

   57.  In RC, Judge Fura gave a strong dissenting opinion,  in  which  she
       disagreed with the  significance  placed  by  the  majority  on  the
       medical report.   In  MA  v  Switzerland,  Judge  Kj�lbro  explained
       cogently why he took issue with the  significance  afforded  by  the
       majority to the court summons from Iran.

   58. We are, of course, well aware of the status  of  minority  opinions.
       They  nevertheless  reinforce  the  point  that  different   judges,
       properly applying a particular standard of proof,  can  legitimately
       reach different conclusions on the evidence.

   59. It is, therefore, not possible to  find  support  for  Mr  Bedford's
       primary submission from the ways  in  which,  in  these  cases,  the
       members of the ECtHR have gone about their fact-finding  tasks.   In
       particular, there is nothing in the cases to suggest that the  court
       regards the threshold of "evidence capable of proving ..." as a  low
       one, let alone so low as to catch only cases that are bound to fail,
       on any rational view.

   60. We turn to the "softer" version of Mr Bedford's  submissions.   This
       involves an analysis of Article 4.5 of the Qualification  Directive.



   61. The first point to mention is one  which  we  have  already  touched
       upon; namely, that Article 4.5 is, on its face, wholly  inconsistent
       with Mr Bedford's "strong" version.  Mr  Bedford,  however,  submits
       that the effect of Article 4.5 is as follows.

   62. The provision applies only in cases where an  applicant's  statement
       is not "supported by documentary or other  evidence".   Article  4.5
       explains the circumstances in which the  absence  of  such  evidence
       can, in effect, be set to one side and the applicant's  claim  still
       accepted as satisfying the burden and  standard  of  proof.   Where,
       however, an applicant does have such documentary or other  evidence,
       in addition to his or her own statement, Mr Bedford submits that the
       corollary of Article 4.5 is the applicant  is  thereby  entitled  to
       succeed.

   63. We do not accept this interpretation.  Article  4.5  means  what  it
       says.  A person who, in respect of each  of  sub-paragraphs  (a)  to
       (e), has put forward a cogent claim should not fail, merely  because
       he or she does not have supporting documentation.   Nowhere  in  the
       Qualification Directive is there to be found any  statement  to  the
       effect that a person who has documentation which, on its  face,  may
       be said to be supportive  of  the  claim  (for  example,  an  arrest
       warrant or  witness  summons),  but  whose  claim  is  found  to  be
       problematic in other respects, has nevertheless made out their case,
       so that the burden of disproving it shifts to the government.

   64. Although it was not cited before us, we observe that in KS  (Benefit
       of the Doubt) [2014] UKUT 00552 (IAC), the Upper Tribunal held  that
       "the  ambit  of  Article  4(5)  is  limited   to   cases   of   non-
       corroboration/confirmation"  (paragraph  85).  We  agree  with  that
       finding.

   65.  Nothing we have said is intended  to  diminish  the  importance  of
       Article  4.5  in  the  circumstances  in  which  it  applies.  Those
       circumstances must, however, be kept in mind.  Article  4.5  has  no
       application outside them.

   66. In  Tanveer  Ahmed  [2002]  UKIAT*  00439,  the  Immigration  Appeal
       Tribunal in a "starred" decision, held that it  is  unnecessary  for
       the respondent to allege that a document relied on by an  individual
       is a forgery, in order to resist the submission  that  the  document
       must be given weight by the Tribunal.  Accordingly, as  set  out  in
       summary in paragraph 38 of the IAT's determination: "It  is  for  an
       individual claimant to show that a document on  which  he  seeks  to
       rely can be relied on".

   67. There is nothing in the Strasbourg case  law  or  the  Qualification
       Directive to call that statement into doubt.   What  the  Strasbourg
       case law does demonstrate is that, where a judicial  fact-finder  is
       satisfied that a document adduced by an  applicant  in  evidence  is
       reliable, then this may mean that the government in question will be
       required to show why the applicant is,  nevertheless,  not  at  real
       risk.   Depending  on  the  circumstances,  that  may  require   the
       government  to  make  its  own  enquiries  regarding  the  document.
       However, as can  be  seen  from  the  dissenting  judgments  in  the
       Strasbourg cases, there is, emphatically, no "bright line" rule that
       governs judicial fact-finding in this area.

   68. For the above reasons, we are satisfied that there is no  indication
       that the Judge applied the wrong burden and standard of proof.   The
       appropriate burden and standard of proof are as we have set  out  at
       [10] above.

    Ground Two: Consideration of the Appellant's Vulnerability


   69. The Appellant's ground two focusses on the Judge's reliance on the
       inconsistencies said to arise between the versions of the
       Appellant's claim. The Appellant's case is that the Judge failed to
       direct himself in accordance with the Joint Presidential Guidance
       Note No 2 of 2010 ("the Presidential Guidance") and the Court of
       Appeal's guidance in AM (Afghanistan) v Secretary of State for the
       Home Department [2017] EWCA Civ 1123 ("AM (Afghanistan)").   The
       Court of Appeal held at [30] in AM (Afghanistan) that a failure to
       follow the Presidential Guidance in a case to which it applies is
       likely to be a material error.


   70. Separately but in the same vein, the Appellant relies on the Court
       of Appeal's decision in JA (Afghanistan) v Secretary of State for
       the Home Department [2014] EWCA Civ 450 ("JA (Afghanistan)") as
       authority for the proposition that it is unfair to rely on the
       screening interview as read particularly where there is no
       independent check of the accuracy of the record.

   71. On the facts of the claim, the Appellant says that the Judge has not
       made allowances for his age when holding against him that he was
       unable to remember the name of the woman who disclosed his father's
       name to the authorities and who he recognised from seeing her on
       television.  Similarly, it is submitted that the Judge failed to
       take into account the Appellant's immaturity as reason for his
       failure to mention when first asked that his mother had been beaten
       when their home was raided, or when considering the Appellant's
       explanation for learning only later that his father's position was
       the source of the family's problems.

   72. The Judge sets out his reasons for disbelieving the Appellant at
       [11] to [23] of the Decision.

   73. In relation to the JA (Afghanistan) point, the Appellant points to
       what is said by the Judge about a discrepancy between the
       Appellant's description of his father's political allegiance during
       his screening interview and his substantive interview at [18] to
       [19] of the Decision.  It is said that the Judge did not take into
       account the Appellant's evidence that there was an error in the
       screening interview.  In any event, it is said that there is no
       obvious discrepancy between the Appellant's father being a senior
       KDP member and at the same time being involved in leafletting.

   74. In the course of his screening interview, the Appellant said that
       his father was in the "Kurdish Democratic Party".  However, in his
       statement of evidence form the Appellant said only that he was "not
       sure about his exact role but he was working for an opposition party
       who were Kurds" ([C.1.1]).  At [C.1.3] the Appellant said that his
       father was working for "the opposition party" when asked why he
       believed he was being targeted.

   75. The Appellant's substantive interview records the following
       exchange:

           "[Q82]      Do you know if your father was in a party at all?
           A:    I don't know which party it was but if you find out about
           the girl who was killed in Sardasht, my father was in the same
           party as she.
           [Q83] At your Screening Interview, you said that he was in the
           Kurdish Democratic Party.  Why are you now saying you don't know
           which party it was?
           A:    I didn't say Kurdish Democratic Party - I just said it was
           a Kurdish party."
   76. Contrary to the Appellant's case on this point now, the Appellant's
       witness statement says this:
           "[10] With regards to my father's involvement in politics, I
           have always maintained that he was a high-ranking official in
           the Kurdish Democratic Party in Iran however I am not sure what
           he did exactly for the party."
       The Appellant does not say that there is any error in the screening
       interview record, that he was misunderstood or offer any explanation
       for the discrepancy.  The error, according to the Appellant's
       account in his statement, is in the SEF form which was self-
       completed at a time when he was legally represented and what he said
       at the substantive interview, which interview he attended with a
       responsible adult.   This part of the second ground is therefore not
       made out on the evidence.


   77. As to the implausibility of a senior ranking party official carrying
       out leafletting, it is not necessarily inconsistent but was a
       finding which it was open to the Judge to make ([21] and [22] of the
       Decision).


   78. The Appellant accepts in his Counsel's skeleton argument for the
       hearing that there is a discrepancy between the Appellant's account
       as to the timing of the execution of the girl who gave up his
       father's name, the identity of the person who alerted the
       Appellant's father to the raid at the family home and how that came
       about.  The Appellant offered an explanation for the discrepancies
       but that was rejected.  In this regard, the Appellant relies on his
       ground one and what is said in JK.  He says that, even if the
       account is implausible in some of its detail, that does not
       necessarily detract from the Appellant's overall credibility (which
       is an unremarkable proposition).  Relying on his first ground,
       though, the Appellant says that having established a claim which is
       "capable of belief" overall, it was for the Respondent to dispel
       doubts about the real risk on return and that he has failed to do
       so.  We have already dealt with that submission above and have
       rejected it.

   79.  However, we are persuaded that the Judge has erred in his treatment
       of the Appellant's evidence in relation to other of the
       inconsistencies upon which reliance was placed.

   80. The Appellant was no longer a minor at the date of the First-tier
       Tribunal hearing.  As such, the Presidential Guidance was no longer
       directly relevant to his evidence on that occasion.  However, as the
       Court of Appeal observed at [18(a)] of its judgment in AM
       (Afghanistan) a Judge can also fall into error by failing properly
       to take into account an appellant's age when making adverse
       credibility findings reliant on inconsistencies in his various
       accounts.

   81. As we find above, the Judge was entitled to rely on certain
       inconsistencies, particularly in relation to the party for whom the
       Appellant's father worked.  In that regard, if the Appellant had
       first claimed not to know for whom his father worked but then said
       it was the KDP, that is an inconsistency which might be explained by
       his age.  Put another way, it is plausible that a child might not
       remember the detail of a claim when first asked, particularly if the
       child found the interview process daunting.  However, the converse
       is not easily explained in the same way.

   82. The inconsistencies regarding the delay in the authorities finding
       his family (14]), and the violence towards him and his mother when
       the authorities came ([16]) might possibly be embellishments
       undermining the Appellant's credibility.  However, they might be
       explained equally by the Appellant not remembering details of events
       when first asked due to his age at the time of interview.
       Similarly, it is plausible that the Appellant would not know details
       of what his father did for the organisation if he was a child as his
       parents would not necessarily have told him ([20]).


   83. Although the Judge notes at [1] of the Decision that the Appellant
       was a minor when he provided his evidence in the various interviews
       and in his SEF and that he has "made the appropriate allowances for
       this in the evidence he gave then" there is no indication thereafter
       that such allowances have been made or how the Appellant's age at
       that time has been factored into the credibility findings.

    Ground Three: Consideration of the Background Material

   84. We are also persuaded that there is merit in the Appellant's ground
       three.  At [11] of the Decision, the Judge finds as implausible that
       the Appellant would not be able to name the girl he saw on the
       television whose execution was there reported.  He found it
       implausible that a television broadcast would not identify the girl
       in both sound and script.  It is not clear on what he bases that
       finding.


   85. The Judge also relied heavily there and at [13] of the Decision on
       the fact that the authorities when they came for the Appellant's
       father brought with them court papers.  It is said that this is
       contrary to the "modus operandi" of the Iranian authorities.  No
       source is cited for that proposition.  Similarly, at [15] of the
       Decision, the Judge did not accept as plausible that the authorities
       would visit precisely at the time that the Appellant's father was
       absent from the home because they would use surveillance to ensure
       he was there.  Again, no material supportive of that finding is
       cited.  Even the most competent of authorities can make mistakes and
       simply because the authorities said to be targeting the Appellant's
       father may operate outside the law does not mean that they do not
       use the judicial process to prosecute opponents.

   86. For the above reasons, we are satisfied that the Decision contains
       material errors of law.  We therefore set aside the Decision.

   87. In relation to the  appropriate  forum  for  the  re-making  of  the
       decision, we have given careful consideration to the Joint  Practice
       Statement of the First-tier Tribunal and Upper  Tribunal  concerning
       the disposal of appeals in this Tribunal.  That reads as follows:
        "[7.2]   The Upper Tribunal is likely  on  each  such  occasion  to
        proceed to re-make the decision, instead of remitting the  case  to
        the First-tier Tribunal, unless the  Upper  Tribunal  is  satisfied
        that:-
                  a) the effect of the error has been to  deprive  a  party
                     before the First-tier Tribunal of a  fair  hearing  or
                     other opportunity for that party's case to be  put  to
                     and considered by the First-tier Tribunal; or
                  b) the nature or extent  of  any  judicial  fact  finding
                     which is necessary in order for the  decision  in  the
                     appeal to be re-made is such that,  having  regard  to
                     the overriding objective in rule 2, it is  appropriate
                     to remit the case to the First-tier Tribunal."

   88. Our reasons for setting aside the Decision concern the Judge's
       adverse credibility findings and, in particular, whether the Judge
       has made due allowance for the Appellant's age when considering his
       answers at interview.  For that reason, we have formed the view that
       the appeal should be remitted for credibility to be considered
       afresh.




    DECISION
    We are satisfied that the Decision contains material errors of law.  We
    set aside the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  A  K  Hussain
    promulgated on 1 February 2018. We remit the appeal to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal for re-hearing before a Judge other than Judge Hussain.
