Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Dolan, Counsel instructed by Genesis Law
Associates Ltd
For the Respondent:    Mr Tarlow, Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appellant's appeal against the decision of Judge James made
    following a hearing at Birmingham on 11th October 2017.

Background

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Zimbabwe  born  on  29th  May  1961.   He
    applied for entry clearance to come to the UK as the spouse  of  Connie
    Chasokela but was refused on 21st October 2016.

 3. The Entry Clearance Officer in the Explanatory Statement sets  out  the
    refusal in the following terms:-

         "In your application, you failed to disclose the following facts.

         In answer to Question 39 on your visa application form,  'Have  you
         ever been convicted of any  criminal  offence  in  the  UK  or  any
         country?' you have answered 'No'.

         I am satisfied that this statement is false as Home Office records,
         confirmed by fingerprint match, show  that  on  18/12/03  you  were
         convicted of failing to provide a specimen for  analysis  at  North
         Hertfordshire Magistrates Court and you were ordered to pay a  fine
         of �160, costs of �55 and your driving licence was endorsed.

         I therefore refuse your application under paragraph EC-P.1.1.(c) of
         Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.  (S-EC.2.2(b))"

 4. At the hearing before the judge the appellant  gave  evidence,  through
    the sponsor, that he did not believe that he  needed  to  disclose  the
    offence because he thought  that  it  was  spent.   His  representative
    however accepted that the  provisions  relating  to  spent  convictions
    contained in the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 were excluded for
    immigration purposes.

 5. The judge concluded that the appellant had indeed failed to disclose  a
    material fact.  At paragraph 22 of the decision he wrote:-

         "I find that in accordance with  the  language  of  the  Rules  the
         Respondent has made a proper determination and there is  no  basis,
         either under the Rules or on the basis of  fairness  under  general
         law to find that the decision is not in accordance with the law."

    He  then  conducted  a  Razgar  analysis  without  reference   to   the
    Immigration  Rules  and  concluded  that  any  interference  with   the
    appellant's family life was proportionate.   Family  life  between  the
    appellant and the sponsor could continue and it was open to him to make
    a further application with full  disclosure  of  the  criminal  offence
    which could be determined within 120 days at the most.

Grounds of Application

 6. The appellant sought permission to appeal and was granted permission by
    Judge Gibb on 9th January 2018.

The Hearing

 7. Mr Tarlow accepted that there was a material error  in  this  decision.
    Although the Immigration Rules are of  importance,  this  was  a  human
    rights appeal and there was no jurisdiction  to  consider  whether  the
    decision was in accordance with the Rules or  in  accordance  with  the
    law, or whether discretion ought to have been exercised differently.

 8. The judge appears to have restricted his consideration of the Rules  to
    a review when he stated that he was satisfied that the Entry  Clearance
    Officer had made a proper decision and had then used that conclusion as
    determinative of the proportionality assessment.   He  did  not  engage
    with the crux of this appeal which was whether the  proportionality  of
    the interference with the appellant's family life  was  established  in
    the respondent's favour.

 9. The judge appears to have decided that the appellant could not meet the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules and had used that as the starting
    point for the dismissal of the appeal on human rights grounds.  What he
    did not engage with was the fact  that  S-EC.2.1.  is  a  discretionary
    refusal. He did not decide whether  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  had
    properly exercised that discretion which would form the  basis  of  his
    proportionality decision.

10. Accordingly, the decision of Judge James is set aside.  He erred in law
    by failing to reach a decision on one of the matters which  was  before
    him.

11. Mr Tarlow, although he accepted that the judge had erred,  nevertheless
    argued that the appellant and sponsor had lived  apart  by  choice  for
    many years and were in a position to submit another application if they
    wished. Accordingly the decision to refuse was proportionate.

12. Mr Dolan submitted that the facts  of  the  original  offence  and  the
    reasons why it had not been disclosed were relevant to the question  of
    proportionality.  It was not correct to say that this was a couple  who
    had decided to live apart. The  appellant  had  left  the  UK  in  2006
    because his father had died  and  remained  in  Zimbabwe  for  business
    reasons.  He had however attempted to visit the UK since then  but  had
    been denied, and his wife had visited him  in  Zimbabwe.   All  of  the
    factors to be considered in Section 117B were in his favour.

Findings and Conclusions

13. The original refusal was based  on  paragraph  S-EC.2.2.  which  states
    that:-

         "Whether or not to the applicant's knowledge -

         (a)  false information,  representations  or  documents  have  been
             submitted in relation  to  the  application  (including  false
             information submitted to any person to obtain a document  used
             in support of the application); or

         (b)  there has  been  a  failure  to  disclose  material  facts  in
             relation to the application".

14.  It is not at issue that the appellant failed to  disclose  a  material
    fact, namely the 2003 conviction for failing to provide  a  sample  for
    which he received a fine and a licence endorsement.  It is not for  the
    Tribunal to substitute its discretion for that of the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer, but this provision is a discretionary refusal and it cannot be
    assumed that if the Immigration Rules were  directly  challengeable  in
    the Tribunal that this refusal would survive.

15. The starting point for the assessment of proportionality cannot be that
    the appellant cannot meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules.

16. There is no dispute to the fact that there is family life between  this
    husband and wife.  The original judge  was  satisfied  that  there  was
    family life between the  couple  and  accepted  that  the  sponsor  has
    visited the appellant regularly in Zimbabwe.  The appellant has made an
    application to join his wife here and this  decision  is  therefore  an
    interference with his ability to enjoy family life with her.

17. The real issue here is proportionality.  So far as Section 117B of  the
    2002  Act  is  concerned,  which   sets   out   the   public   interest
    considerations applicable in all cases, it is  not  disputed  that  the
    appellant speaks English and that he is  financially  independent.   No
    issues were raised by the original Entry Clearance Officer with respect
    to his maintenance.

18. The maintenance of effective  immigration  control  is  in  the  public
    interest. However, whilst it is indisputable that the appellant  failed
    to disclose a conviction there are a number of mitigating factors which
    would indicate that this is a case where discretion may well have  been
    exercised in his favour.  I was told that the offence  itself  occurred
    when the appellant was parked, asleep in the driving seat.   He  failed
    to provide a specimen for analysis and was fined.  The  offence  itself
    took place fifteen years ago.

19. The respondent's argument is not that there is a difficulty in relation
    to the conviction, the  difficulty  arises  as  a  consequence  of  the
    failure to disclose. However  the  original  judge  did  not  make  any
    adverse finding in relation to the appellant's honesty  or  his  belief
    that the conviction would have been spent.  The conviction itself is at
    the lowest possible end of the spectrum and took place many years  ago.



20. I accept that the appellant may well have believed that  it  was  spent
    and that his failure to disclose was as a consequence  of  an  innocent
    mistake.

21. I do not accept the respondent's argument that this  couple  have  been
    living apart for many years and there is no reason why they should  not
    continue to do so, or indeed make a fresh application.  The  fact  that
    this application has been made in itself indicates that they no  longer
    want to remain apart for  periods  of  time  and  only  continue  their
    married life through visits.  Whether another application could be made
    is not an answer to the question of whether this refusal amounts  to  a
    disproportionate interference with the appellant's right to family life
    with his wife.  In this case I am satisfied that  the  public  interest
    here is outweighed by the strength of the factors  in  the  appellant's
    favour.
