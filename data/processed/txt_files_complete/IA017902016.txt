                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals with permission against the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal dismissing his appeal against the  respondent's  decision
    to refuse him leave to remain in the United Kingdom as the spouse of  a
    person present and settled here.   On  1  April  2016,  the  respondent
    refused leave to remain on that basis, finding the  marriage  to  be  a
    marriage of convenience not entitling the applicant to  be  treated  as
    his  wife's  partner.   The  respondent  was  not  satisfied  that  the
    appellant and his wife intended  to  live  together  permanently.   The
    couple already had a child, who was 15 months old at the  date  of  the
    refusal letter.

Procedural history

 2. The decision of First-tier  Judge  Walker  in  September  2017  is  the
    Devaseelan starting  point.   Judge  Walker  found  that  although  the
    appellant and his wife knew  each  other  reasonably  well,  and  might
    indeed have been in a relationship 'at some stage' their  marriage  and
    their  asserted  relationship  was  not  subsisting  nor  genuine.   He
    dismissed the appeal.

 3. On 11 June 2018, DUTJ Lewis overturned that decision and  remitted  the
    appeal to the First-tier Tribunal for rehearing.  The  adverse  finding
    of fact regarding the marital relationship  was  not  impugned  in  the
    appeal and was preserved, although neither Judge Walker nor Judge Lewis
    went as far as to say that the marriage was a marriage of  convenience,
    nor that the child was not the appellant's child.

 4. Judge Lewis at [14]-[16] gave a very clear  direction  as  to  how  the
    Devaseelan starting point should be approached by the  Judge  rehearing
    the appeal:

         "14. ... It is pleaded, for example, that  the  [First-tier  Judge]
         has erred  in  failing  to  take  account  that  the  parties  live
         together, in failing to have regard to  the  documentary  evidence,
         and/or in failing to have regard to the fact that the couple had ad
         a child together.  It seems to me absolutely clear that  the  Judge
         had all of these matters well in mind.  He refers to the supporting
         evidence, and clearly had it in mind that there was a child.  I can
         find nothing in the challenge that undermines the findings  of  the
         First-tier Judge:   in  my  judgment  they  were  sustainably  made
         without error of law.

         15.  In my judgment those findings  should  stand  as  having  been
         sustainably made.  However, that does not mean to  say  that  those
         findings could not be revisited within the principles of Devaseelan
         on  a  rehearing:  they  should  stand  as  a  starting  point   to
         consideration of remaking the decision  in  the  appeal.   In  this
         context it is to be  noted  that  the  First-tier  Judge  expressed
         concerns about the absence of certain sorts of supporting evidence:
         it is open to the appellant, together with [his wife] if he or they
         wish to maintain they are indeed in a committed subsisting  genuine
         marital relationship to advance further evidence  in  support:  for
         example, one matter that the Judge expressed concerning  about  was
         the absence of independent witnesses and/or testimony from  members
         of [the wife's] family who might have reasonably been  expected  to
         be willing and able to give  evidence  as  to  the  nature  of  the
         relationship.

         16.  Accordingly, in upholding and preserving the findings  of  the
         First-tier  Judge  in  respect  of  the  relationship  between  the
         appellant and [his wife] I  do  not  preclude  the  appellant  from
         revisiting this matter  ...  on  the  basis  that  it  is  for  the
         appellant to advance evidence that would permit the next  Judge  to
         revisit the finding of Judge Walker pursuant  to  the  guidance  in
         Devaseelan.  Of course, if the appellant now wishes to  acknowledge
         and accept the findings of the Judge, he  will  no  doubt  wish  to
         shift the focus of his case to providing evidence as to the  nature
         and extent of his contact and relationship with his child."

First-tier Tribunal decision

 5. The appeal was reheard in the First-tier Tribunal by  First-tier  Judge
    Geraint Jones QC.  The appellant  was  unrepresented  and  appeared  in
    person.  There was no updated witness statement, but the appellant, his
    wife, and his cousin all gave oral evidence.

 6. By this stage, the parties had lost their joint accommodation  and  the
    appellant was living with a school friend.  The wife  was  living  with
    her sister, in Essex, where there was only room for her and the  child.
    The wife had converted to Islam.  The  wife  and  the  child  are  both
    British citizens. The appellant expressed doubt that his wife would  go
    to Bangladesh with him, but in her oral evidence she said that she  had
    not  yet  decided  the  point.   They  were  both  working  for   Tesco
    supermarkets and each earned about ï¿½600 a month.

 7. The evidence about the appellant's daughter was that she had been  born
    in January 2015 and was  now  attending  pre-school.   The  appellant's
    daughter appeared to be a normal, well-adjusted young child  who  lived
    with her mother and her aunt.  Judge Jones found that the appellant saw
    his daughter once every 10-14 days, for an unspecified period of  time,
    but that he did not make any, or any significant financial contribution
    to her welfare.  Judge Jones  held  that  it  was  'probable  that  the
    appellant's daughter recognises the appellant as her father',  but  was
    not satisfied that the couple and the child had lived together  as  one
    household for any significant period of time.

 8. Judge Jones found that the child's best interests were  being  properly
    served by living under the sole care and control  of  her  mother;  the
    child and the wife were British citizens and would not be  required  to
    leave the United Kingdom if the appellant were removed.  Contact  could
    be maintained by electronic means. He held that there was  no  imminent
    or even medium-term prospect  of  the  parties  resuming  cohabitation,
    partly because of their very low joint income.

 9. The appeal was dismissed, both within and outwith the Immigration Rules
    HC 395 (as amended). The appellant appealed to the Upper Tribunal.

Permission to appeal

10. There were six grounds of appeal.  The appellant contended  that  there
    were no negative credibility findings in relation to the appellant, his
    wife or his cousin, all of whom gave  oral  evidence;  that  the  Judge
    appeared  to  accept  that  the  appellant  was  seeing  his   daughter
    regularly,  although  not  living  with  her  and  that  it  would   be
    unreasonable for her to be expected to  relocate  to  Bangladesh  as  a
    British citizen child; that there were insufficient  findings  of  fact
    about the nature of the relationship  between  the  appellant  and  his
    daughter, relying on SR (subsisting  parental  relationship,  s117B(6))
    [2018] UKUT 334 (IAC); that the unchallenged  evidence  of  the  cousin
    about the couple's cohabitation had not been considered properly;  that
    MA (Pakistan) and others, R on the  application  of  v  Upper  Tribunal
    (Immigration and Asylum Chamber and another [2106] EWCA Civ 705 had not
    been properly applied; that the child's right to have direct in  person
    access and contact with her father had not  been  properly  considered;
    that the Judge raised issues on which the appellant, acting in  person,
    had not been given an opportunity to comment, that the Judge's findings
    lacked anxious scrutiny and  failed  to  take  account  of  photographs
    submitted.

11. Permission was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Owens:

         "2.  The appellant asserts that he has established  a  family  life
             with his British citizen daughter in the UK.  It  would  be  a
             disproportionate breach of Article 8 ECHR to remove  him  from
             the UK.

         3.   It is arguable  that  the  Judge  failed  properly  to  assess
             Article 8 ECHR outside the rules by failing to correctly apply
             section 117B(6) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act
             2002 to his findings of  fact  and  misapplying  an  incorrect
             test."

Upper Tribunal hearing

12. The appellant, his wife and their daughter were present  at  the  Upper
    Tribunal  hearing.   They  are  now  living  together,   having   found
    accommodation they can afford, it seems.

13. For the appellant, Mr Karim reminded me that despite  the  respondent's
    doubts about the genuine nature of their relationship, the  appellant's
    wife had appeared at every hearing  to  support  him.   The  First-tier
    Judge had overlooked her witness statement, in which she said they both
    contributed to financial commitments and to  their  daughter's  upkeep.
    They had cohabited until they lost their flat in September 2017, but as
    of 1 September 2019 they had finally been able  to  find  somewhere  to
    live together as a family and were now doing so.  He asked me to  allow
    the appeal outright.

14. For the respondent, Mr Melvin produced an out of time Rule 24 Reply  to
    the grant of permission to appeal, which I have treated as his skeleton
    argument.  Mr Melvin submitted that it  was  clear  from  Judge  Jones'
    decision that he was not satisfied that the appellant had a genuine and
    subsisting relationship with his wife  and  daughter,  and  that  Judge
    Jones had heard the oral evidence and his decision was sustainable.

15. Mr Melvin accepted that the appellant had  been  disadvantaged  by  not
    being represented.  He accepted that another Judge might have reached a
    different conclusion, and  that  the  decision  had  deficiencies,  but
    argued that they would not have  made  a  material  difference  to  the
    outcome of the appeal.

16. If I were to conclude that the decision was  unsound,  Mr  Melvin  said
    that the decision should be remade by the Upper Tribunal.  He would not
    ask to have the appellant or his wife tendered for cross-examination.

Analysis

17. A Tribunal should be slow to find a lack of  family  and  private  life
    between parent and minor child. I find that Judge Jones failed properly
    to consider the new evidence which was before him, but that he did find
    that she recognised him as her father and  that  they  saw  each  other
    every 10 to 14 days.  That is  more  than  sufficient  to  establish  a
    genuine and subsisting parental relationship.

18. I also find that Judge Jones failed to  evaluate  the  wife's  evidence
    that they bear the family expenses jointly, and that of the cousin that
    they were cohabiting until they lost their accommodation  in  September
    2017 and are now cohabiting again.

19. Under of Section 117 of the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
    2002 (as amended) at 117B(6):

         "117B(6)  In the case of a person who is not liable to  deportation
         the public interest does not require the person's removal where -

         (a)  the person has a genuine and subsisting parental  relationship
             with a qualifying child, and

         (b)  it would not be reasonable to expect the child  to  leave  the
             United Kingdom."

20. I am satisfied that the appellant has a genuine and subsisting parental
    relationship with his daughter, and I  take  account  of  Judge  Jones'
    finding of fact that it would not be reasonable to expect this child to
    leave the United Kingdom and go with her father to live in  Bangladesh.
    No MA (Pakistan) strong reasons for separating the appellant  from  his
    daughter have been shown.  The public interest  does  not  require  his
    removal.

21. Accordingly I set aside the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   I
    substitute a decision allowing this appeal.
