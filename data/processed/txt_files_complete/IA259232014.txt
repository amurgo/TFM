                            DECISION AND REASONS

    History of Appeal

 1. The Appellant, who was born on 27th April 1970, is  a  citizen  of  the
    United States of America. He married Milena Chomova on  10th  September
    2011. She is a national of the Slovak Republic, who  was  born  on  1st
    July 1976.  On 5th November 2013 he was granted entry clearance to  the
    United Kingdom as the family member of an EEA national and  he  entered
    the United Kingdom on 1st December 2013. He has  also  been  previously
    granted entry clearance in the same category  and  during  his  earlier
    period of leave on 19th September 2013, he was offered employment as  a
    Senior Manager: Quality Integration on a salary of ï¿½75,000  per  annum.
    He started this employment on 4th November 2013.

 2. On 2nd May 2014, the Appellant applied for a residence card to  confirm
    his right to reside in the United Kingdom. The Secretary of  State  for
    the Home Department refused his application on 12th June  2014  on  the
    basis that there was insufficient evidence to establish that  his  wife
    was an EEA national who was financially self-sufficient. The Respondent
    relied on the case of AG and others (EEA -  jobseeker,  self-sufficient
    person  -  proof)  Germany  [2007]  UKAIT  00075  and  noted  that  the
    Appellant's wife's only source of income appeared to be his salary.

 3. The Appellant appealed against this decision  and  in  a  determination
    with reasons, promulgated on 23rd September 2014,  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Colvin allowed his  appeal.  Firstly,  she  found  that,  as  the
    Appellant was working here on a legal basis, his income could be  taken
    into account to show that his wife was self-sufficient for the purposes
    of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 ("the  EEA
    Regulations"). In the alternative, she found that the  bank  statements
    submitted for the appeal established that the Appellant's  wife  was  a
    self-sufficient person for the purposes of the Regulations, even if the
    Appellant's income was disregarded.

 4. The Secretary of  State  for  the  Home  Department  appealed  on  26th
    September 2014 and First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Pooler  found  that  the
    grounds were arguable insofar as they focus on the Judge's finding that
    the Appellant's income from employment in the United Kingdom  could  be
    taken into account when finding that his EEA national spouse was  self-
    sufficient. But he also noted that the Judge had found in favour of the
    Appellant on the basis that she had otherwise found that the  Appellant
    met  the  requirements  of  Regulation  4  on  self-sufficiency.  As  a
    consequence, he found that the grounds did not demonstrate an  arguable
    and material error of law.

 5. On 20th November 2014 the Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department
    renewed her appeal to the Upper Tribunal. She said that  she  continued
    to rely on the grounds submitted to the First-tier  Tribunal  but  also
    asserted that the savings relied upon by First-tier Judge  Colvin  were
    inadequate to render the Appellant's wife self-sufficient and were,  in
    any event, the product of the Appellant's employment.  She  added  that
    it would be bizarre if the circularity argument which disqualifies  the
    Appellant and his EEA spouse from relying on his earnings did not  also
    apply to the savings that are the result of  those  earnings.  On  20th
    February  2015  Deputy  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Bruce  found  that  the
    Secretary of State for the Home Department's grounds were arguable.

    Error of Law Hearing

 6. The Appellant's counsel submitted a skeleton argument and the  case  of
    Alokpa C-86/12 at the start of the hearing.

 7. The Home Office Presenting Officer then made his submissions. He argued
    that guidance provided by the Home Office does not have the same  legal
    status as statute and that there was no evidence before the  First-Tier
    Tribunal paper hearing to show that the Appellant's wife was exercising
    a Treaty right.  He also asserted that their joint savings derived from
    the Appellant's husband's earnings.

 8. The Appellant's counsel then stated that the Appellant's wife  was  now
    working four hours a week and submitted evidence, which confirmed  that
    this was the case.  It also revealed that she had  been  working  since
    August 2014, which was prior to the First-tier Tribunal hearing.

 9. The Appellant's counsel then made his oral  submissions  and  confirmed
    that he was not arguing that AG and  Others  was  not  good  law.   But
    asserted that the Appellant could rely on the  joint  savings  he  held
    with his wife as they derived in part from her redundancy  payment  and
    in part from salary paid to the Appellant when he was working  lawfully
    in the United Kingdom.

10. He also relied on the fact that the evidence, which was  before  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Colvin, was sufficient to show that the Appellant's
    wife was self-sufficient.

11. In paragraph 14 of her determination with reasons  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Colvin said that she accepted that  it  was  reasonable  for  the
    Appellant to interpret the wording of the Guidance  note  for  applying
    for residence documentation as an EEA national or as the family  member
    of an EEA national issued by the Home Office on 1 January 2014 and  EEA
    application forms as permitting the income of the family member to show
    self-sufficiency.   At  the  error  of  law  hearing  the  Home  Office
    Presenting Officer correctly pointed out that guidance  does  not  have
    the force of statute. In addition, at paragraph 82 of AG and Others the
    Upper Tribunal found that it had to apply the EEA Regulations and  that
    the IDIs, which are comparable to the Guidance, are at most an  aid  to
    the construction of the Regulations.

12. Regulation 4(4) of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations
    2006 ("the EEA Regulations") does state that for the  purposes  of  the
    definition of a 'self-sufficient person' provided in  regulation  1(1)(
    c) "the resources of the person concerned and,  where  applicable,  any
    family members, are to be regarded as sufficient". However, I note that
    the phrase "where applicable" limits the utility of this statement.

13. Furthermore, I find that this subsection and also sub-section  4(2)(a),
    which again refers to the resources of an  applicant  and  his  family,
    must be viewed within the overall context of the  EEA  Regulations  and
    the Citizens' Directive.  When doing so, I have taken into account  the
    fact that at paragraph 72 of AG and Others  the  Upper  Tribunal  found
    that "both the Regulations and the Citizens' Directive make very  clear
    that the right to reside of family  members  is  dependent  upon  their
    being family members of a Union citizen who can establish  a  right  to
    reside in his or her own right". Then at paragraph  73  it  found  that
    "the right of residence of the family member is premised upon the Union
    citizen being able, separately, to satisfy  the  requirement  of  self-
    sufficiency".

14. Although there was discussion in the factual circumstances  of  AG  and
    Others about whether the relevant income was earned lawfully, this  did
    not mean that the Appellant and his wife could rely on  income  he  had
    lawfully earned if she was not exercising a right of free  movement  in
    the United Kingdom. Therefore, I find that  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Colvin  did  err  in  law  when  she  found  in  paragraph  15  of  her
    determination with reasons that "due to the fact that [her husband]  is
    legally working in the UK as the family  member  of  the  EEA  national
    under an EEA family permit his income [alone] may be taken into account
    in showing his wife's self-sufficiency under the [EEA] Regulations". As
    submitted by the Respondent in her grounds of appeal to the  First-tier
    Tribunal "the EEA national  sponsor  must  first  exercise  her  treaty
    rights to enable the appellant to derive his rights".

15. This approach was also adopted in Alokpa C-86/12 where the ECJ found at
    paragraph 25 that "it is clear from the case law of the Court that  the
    status of 'dependent' family member of a Union citizen holding a  right
    of residence is the result of a factual situation characterised by  the
    fact that material support for the family member  is  provided  by  the
    holder of the right of residence, so that, when the converse  situation
    occurs and the holder of the right of residence occurs and  the  holder
    of the right of residence is dependent on a third country national, the
    third country national cannot rely on being a 'dependent' relative..."

16. However, in paragraph 16 of her determination with  reasons  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Colvin also  found  that  "even  when  disregarding  the
    appellant's  income,  the  requirements  of  regulation  4   on   self-
    sufficiency are shown". She relied on the fact that there was a  Lloyds
    Joint Easy Saver which had a balance of ï¿½36,000 on 26th June  2014  and
    that there was also an ending  balance  of  US$5303  (or  approximately
    ï¿½3,255) in two joint accounts with Membership Savings and Desert Fusion
    Checking in May 2014.

17. These documents were contained in the very  extensive  bundle  prepared
    for the First-tier Tribunal hearing.  Annexe  12  contained  statements
    from Classic Vantage joint account held by the Appellant and  his  wife
    at Lloyds Bank. Sheet 43 of 49 shows ï¿½16,751.27 being paid  into  their
    joint account on 7th May 2014 and the statement entries  in  Annexe  11
    show this same sum being transferred on that same day into their  joint
    Lloyds Easy Saver account.  The same statement shows that no money  had
    been transferred out of that account by the time of the hearing  before
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Colvin.

18. The Appellant's own bank statements show payments in for his salary and
    travel expenses but do not show any payment out of  ï¿½16,751.27  or  any
    ability to pay such a sum into their joint account  on  7th  May  2014.
    The grounds of appeal, which  were  before  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Colvin also clearly state that the ï¿½16,751.27 derived from a redundancy
    package awarded to the Appellant's wife by DHL. In addition, there were
    statements showing that the Appellant and his wife held  joint  savings
    with the Desert Schools Federal Credit Union and  that  she  had  three
    additional bank accounts of her own in the Slovak Republic.

19. In the light of this evidence, it is clear  that  there  was  a  lawful
    basis for First-tier Tribunal Judge Colvin to find that the Appellant's
    wife was self-sufficient at the date of the paper hearing before  here.



    Conclusion

    1.    The  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge's  determination  with  reasons,
         promulgated on 23rd September 2014,  did  not  include  a  material
         error of law, as the evidence of the  joint  savings  and  accounts
         held by the Appellant and his wife confirmed that she had resources
         of her own, which indicated that she was  self-sufficient  for  the
         purposes of the EEA Regulations  at  the  date  of  the  First-tier
         Tribunal hearing.

      2. The Secretary of State for the  Home  Department's  appeal  to  the
         Upper Tribunal is dismissed.

      3. The First-tier Tribunal Judge's decision is upheld.
