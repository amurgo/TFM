                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Appellant against the decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge T R Smith promulgated on the 29th November 2018  whereby
    the judge dismissed the appellant's appeal against the decision of  the
    respondent to refuse the appellant's claims based on Article 8  of  the
    ECHR.

 2. I have considered whether or not it is appropriate to make an anonymity
    direction. Having considered all the circumstances I do not consider it
    necessary to do so.

 3. Leave to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was  granted  by  Upper  Tribunal
    Judge Kamara on 1st March 2019. Thus the case  appeared  before  me  to
    determine whether or not there was a  material  error  of  law  in  the
    decision.

    Factual background

 4. The appellant is a national of Iraq. Having entered the United  Kingdom
    the appellant was granted discretionary leave on 21 October 2011  valid
    until 20 October 2014.

 5. The appellant applied for his leave to be extended on 1  October  2014.
    That application was granted on 26 April 2015 until 25 April 2018.

 6. On 10 April 2018 the appellant made application for indefinite leave to
    remain in the United Kingdom on the basis of  his  having  completed  6
    years discretionary leave to remain.

 7. As part  of  the  documentation  in  support  of  his  application  the
    appellant had submitted a Life in the UK Test Pass Notification  Letter
    (the letter). It has to be noted  that  the  appellant  need  not  have
    submitted such a letter as it was not a requirement under the rules for
    the application made.

 8. The respondent refused the appellant's application by decision dated 18
    April 2018. The respondent had conducted enquiries into the letter  and
    was satisfied that the  letter  had  been  obtained  fraudulently.  The
    appellant's application was therefore refused under paragraph  322(1A).
    Paragraph 322 (1A) provides: -

         Grounds on which leave to remain and variation of leave to enter or
         remain in the United Kingdom are to be refused.

         (1A) where false representations have been made or false  documents
         or information have been submitted (whether or not material to  the
         application, and whether or not to the applicant's  knowledge),  or
         material  facts  have  not  been  disclosed  in  relation  to   the
         application or in order to obtain documents from the  Secretary  of
         State or a third-party required in support of the application.

 9. The appellant appealed against the decision. The appeal  was  heard  by
    Judge Smith on 8 November 2018. Judge Smith  dismissed  the  appeal  by
    decision promulgated on 29 November 2018.

10.  The  appellant's  representative  indicated  at  the  outset  of   the
    proceedings before me that he  had  not  had  sight  of  the  notes  of
    evidence  given  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  He  seemed  to  be
    suggesting that there may have been  some  confusion  in  some  of  the
    evidence. That appears to be  nothing  more  than  speculation  in  the
    absence of the record of the evidence. The judge has clearly noted down
    the material parts of the evidence before him,  carefully  setting  out
    the factual basis for the decision reached.

11. In seeking to challenge the  decision  of  Judge  Smith  the  appellant
    asserts that the judge has failed  to  give  anxious  scrutiny  to  the
    appellant's account; failed to consider the material  evidence  in  the
    round; and taken immaterial matters into consideration. The appellant's
    representative accepted in the circumstances that  the  issue  was  the
    credibility of the appellant's account.

12. The judge has  made  a  number  of  findings  to  the  benefit  of  the
    appellant, see paragraphs 33 to 39. The judge from paragraph 41 onwards
    sets out the evidence that had been presented to him. The  judge  notes
    in paragraph 41 that the appellant accepted that he had not  taken  the
    test at the test centre originally bought. The  circumstances  are  set
    out in paragraph 42 where the appellant was taken  to  another  centre.
    The appellant otherwise had admitted that on the day he had  paid  �350
    for intensive coaching of an hour and for the certificate.

13. In the decision the judge  noted  that  the  appellant  had  undertaken
    coaching sessions in order to prepare for the test. It  is  noted  that
    the appellant paid �300 a significant amount of money for the  coaching
    sessions and that those lessons could be unlimited until the  appellant
    pass the test. However on the day of the test the  appellant  had  paid
    �350 for a one hour intensive coaching session and the letter.

14. The judge then goes on to give reasons for finding that it was  obvious
    on the basis of the appellant's account  not  only  did  the  appellant
    believe he needed the letter but also that he knew that the  person  to
    whom he was paying the money was not  employed  by  Learn  Direct.  The
    judge has carefully looked  at  the  evidence  given  and  given  valid
    reasons for finding that the letter produced by the appellant  was  not
    genuine and that the appellant knew that it was not genuine. The  judge
    has concluded that the appellants claim to be the  innocent  victim  of
    fraud was not in the circumstances credible. The judge has given  valid
    reasons for finding the appellant knew that the letter was a fraud  and
    that what he was doing was dishonest.

15. The judge has given valid reasons for coming to the conclusion that  he
    has. There is no arguable error of law in the  decision.  The  decision
    therefore stands.

    Decision

16. I dismiss the appeal on all grounds.
