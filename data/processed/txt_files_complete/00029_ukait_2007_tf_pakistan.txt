A student who has been accepted on a course lasting for less than six
months and has a conditional offer for a (subsequent) course which would
extend the study to a period of more than six months has not been accepted
on a course of more than six months and therefore has no right of appeal
save on human rights or race discrimination grounds because of the
provisions of s.91 (1) (a).

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant, a citizen of Pakistan born on 25 April 1982, applied  on
    26 May 2005 for leave to enter the United Kingdom as a  student.  On  9
    June 2005 her  application  was  refused.    She  purported  to  appeal
    against that decision to the Tribunal  and  her  appeal  was  heard  at
    Hatton Cross on 28  April  2006  by  Immigration  Judge  Greasley.   He
    allowed the appellant's appeal.

2.   On 22 May 2006 reconsideration of the Immigration Judge's decision  was
    ordered under section 103A of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum
    Act 2002.  The reason for ordering  reconsideration  was  that  it  was
    arguable that the appellant had not been entitled to appeal against the
    refusal of entry clearance as the only course on  which  she  had  been
    unconditionally accepted would last for less than six months.

3.   Whilst in Pakistan, the appellant had undertaken a six month course  as
    a beautician.    The time came, however,  when  she  decided  that  she
    would like to pursue a course in the United Kingdom on child  care.  In
    her application form, the appellant stated at Box 9.2 that  she  wished
    to undertake 'English language course 4  July  -  26  August  05.  GCSE
    programme September 2005 one year'. These were to be undertaken at  New
    College Nottingham.

4.   Interviewed on 9 June 2005, the appellant told the respondent that  she
    would study in the United Kingdom a 'child care course'.  Asked  'Which
    subjects will the course cover?' she replied 'GCSE course'.

5.   The notice of refusal addressed to the appellant began by  telling  the
    appellant 'You have applied for entry clearance to the  United  Kingdom
    as a student for less than 6 months'.    The  notice  stated  that  the
    appellant had been unable satisfactorily to explain the  basic  content
    of her proposed course or the future benefits that  might  accrue  from
    it.  Her proposed course was regarded by the respondent as 'unrealistic
    because it is inconsistent with your previous pattern of study'.    The
    appellant had, furthermore, 'taken no preparatory steps for your course
    to ensure that these studies are appropriate'. Finally, the appellant's
    account of her 'personal, economic and  social  circumstances  and  how
    these studies will be used does not  satisfy  me,  on  the  balance  of
    probabilities,  that  you  intend  to  leave  the  United  Kingdom   on
    completion of you studies'.

6.    In  the  explanatory  statement,  the  respondent  asserted  that  the
appellant:

             'does not have a right of appeal as a student as defined under
             s.82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002.
             This is because the appellant submitted an  acceptance  letter
             from New College Nottingham dated 16  February  2005,  stating
             she had an unconditional offer for  enrolment  on  an  English
             language course with the duration for July 2005 - August 2005.
             However, the subsequent offer for a progression to  a  1  year
             GCSE course is conditional on completion of IELTS to level 5.5
             and reward (sic) of  a  satisfactory  progress  report.  Given
             this, we could only  assess  this  application  based  on  the
             initial course, which is less than 6  months.  Therefore  this
             application does not attract a full right of appeal and should
             be dismissed.'

7.   The Tribunal's attention has not been directed  to  the  letter  of  16
    February 2005. However, before the Immigration Judge there was a letter
    dated 24 June 2005  from  New  College  Nottingham,  which  appears  to
    reiterate the contents of the earlier letter. The  letter  of  24  June
    2005 stated:

             'We confirm that [the appellant] has an unconditional offer as
             a student on the English language course  starting  July  4th,
             2005 - August 26th 2005.  This is  a  weekday  course  and  it
             involves attendance for a minimum of 15 hours per week daytime
             study.





             The total fee for this course is �840 and the student has paid
             a deposit of �500 to guarantee a place on the course.


             The student has a conditional offer for progression on to  the
             GSCE programme starting 5 September 2005  for  one  year.   To
             progress the student must achieve the required IELTS level 5.5
             and obtain a satisfactory progress and attendance report.   On
             successful completion of the GSCE  programme  a  student  will
             progress to  the  Childcare  and  Education  Cache  Foundation
             Award.  The fees for this  course  are  �4,000.  However,  the
             student is eligible for the 'Country  Bursary'  therefore  the
             fee is reduced to �3,500 for each year.' (writer's emphases)

8.   A further letter of 9 March 2006 from New  College  Nottingham  was  in
    similar terms, albeit that it referred to the two courses starting on 3
    July 2006 and 4 September 2006  respectively.  At  the  reconsideration
    hearing, the Tribunal was also shown a  letter of 6  June  2006,  which
    was not before the Immigration Judge, but which purported to confirm on
    behalf of New College Nottingham 'that the one  month  initial  English
    Language Course,  is  a  preliminary  requirement  to  the  GCSE  study
    programme'.

9.   The Immigration Judge found as follows:

           '7.    Mr Gibbs [the Presenting Officer] indicated that  he  did
               not seek to challenge any of the evidence provided from  the
               sponsor.


           8.     However, he nonetheless asked me to consider the contents
               of the explanatory statement, issued on  14  November  2005,
               which indicated that a letter from New College in Nottingham
               dated 9 March 2006, said that appellant  was  placed  on  an
               unconditional  offer  (sic)  as  a  student  on  an  English
               language course for one month.  There was then a conditional
               offer for progression to a  GCSE  English  programme  course
               lasting one year.  Satisfactory progress in this would  then
               lead to enrolment on the Child Care and Education Foundation
               Award course.


           9.     Mr Gibbs submitted that the Entry Clearance  Officer  had
               taken the  view  that  the  initial  one  month  course  was
               separate to, and an additional requirement  of,  progression
               to the GSCE English course.  On this basis, given the course
               lasted less than six months, the Entry Clearance Officer had
               found that there was no available right  of  appeal  against
               this decision, given that the course was of  less  than  one
               year's duration and was accordingly excluded by operation of
               Section 89 of the 2002 Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum
               Act.


           10. Ms Taylor submitted  that  the  one  month  initial  English
               language course was clearly a preliminary requirement to the
               GCSE study and was not to be considered as  a  separate  one
               month course. This was simply  an  initial  hurdle  for  the
               appellant to clear, once the college was satisfied as to her
               proficiency in English.  Moreover, the appellant's interview
               albeit brief, had been conducted in English and there was no
               suggestion that she had had any difficulty understanding the
               questions.


           11.  Having heard the submissions in this appeal,  I  find  that
               the appeal must be upheld.  Given that Mr Gibbs did not seek
               to challenge  any  of  the  documentary  evidence  from  the
               appellant's  uncle,   in   relation   to   maintenance   and
               accommodation matters, those specific grounds of refusal set
               out in the certificate (sic) were not,  in  essence,  relied
               upon.


           12.  I find that the preliminary one month English course is, as
               Ms Taylor submits, a necessary precursor to the GCSE  course
               itself and is therefore not a stand alone course  of  study,
               but  rather,  a  well-recognised  lead-in  English  language
               course which  will  introduce  the  appellant  to  the  GCSE
               studies.


           13. I also find that the appellant was  able  to  speak  English
               during her interview, and there was no suggestion  that  she
               struggled with any other questions asked of her. I  find  it
               reasonably likely that the appellant  will,  in  any  event,
               successfully pass the initial one month course.


           14.  Having  considered  the  helpful  submissions   from   both
               representatives, accordingly  I  therefore  find  that  this
               appeal must be upheld under paragraph 57 of the  Immigration
               Rules.'


10.  The relevant provisions of the Immigration Rules are as follows:

       '57. The requirements to be met by a person seeking  leave  to  enter
           the United Kingdom as a student are that he:


           (i) has been accepted for a course  of  study  which  is  to  be
              provided  by  an  organisation  which  is  included  on   the
              Department for Education and Skills'  Register  of  Education
              and Training Providers, and is either ...


             ...


              (b) a bona fide private education institution which maintains
               satisfactory records of enrolment and attendance; [and]


           ...




           (ii) is able and intends to follow ...


           ...




                (b) a weekday full time course  involving  attendance  at  a
                  single  institution  for  a  minimum  of  fifteen   hours
                  organised daytime study per week of a single subject,  or
                  indirectly related subjects;
           ...


           (iv) intends to leave the United  Kingdom  at  the  end  of  his
              studies; and


           (v) does not intend to engage in business or to take employment,
              except  part-time  or  vacation   work  undertaken  with  the
              consent of the Secretary of State for  Employment;  and


           (vi) is able to meet the costs of his course  and  accommodation
              and the maintenance of himself  and  any  dependants  without
              taking employment or engaging in business or having  recourse
              to public funds.'

11.  Section 91(1) of the  Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002
    provides as follows:

           1)  A person may not appeal under section 82(1) against  refusal
              of entry clearance if he seeks it -


                 a) in order to follow a course of study for  which  he  has
                    been accepted and which will  not  last  more  than  six
                    months,


               (b)    in order to study but without  having  been  accepted
                    for a course, or


                 b) as the dependant of a person seeking entry clearance for
                    a purpose described in paragraph (a) or (b).'

12.  Section  91(2)  provides  that  section  91(1)  does  not  prevent  the
    bringing of an appeal on the grounds referred to  in  section  84(1)(b)
    and (c), namely, on racial discrimination or human rights grounds.

13.  At the reconsideration hearing Ms Taylor, who had also appeared  before
    the Immigration Judge, submitted that the Immigration Judge  had  taken
    as a preliminary issue the question whether there was a right of appeal
    and that she and the Presenting Officer had addressed  the  Immigration
    Judge on whether, as a matter of fact, he had to consider one course or
    two courses.   The Immigration Judge had, she said, concluded that  the
    English course and the GCSE  course  were,  in  effect,  one  composite
    course.   Ms Taylor drew the analogy of a  three  year  degree  course,
    where although one is accepted on to it, passing from the first to  the
    second year, and the second to the  third,  is  nevertheless  dependent
    upon obtaining a satisfactory standard at the end of the earlier of the
    years in question.

14.  However, it is plain that there is  more  to  section  91(1)  than  the
    issue of the duration of a course. The structure  of  section  91(1)(a)
    and (b) is such that, in order to have a right of appeal, a person must
    have  been accepted for a course of study and  that course must be  one
    that will last more than six months. If the only  course  for  which  a
    person has been accepted is one that lasts  six  months  or  less,  she
    cannot appeal against the refusal of entry clearance,  whether  or  not
    she has an aspiration to follow some other longer course for which  she
    has not been accepted. Acceptance on a course of more than  six  months
    is a prerequisite to being able  to  appeal,  subject  to  the  limited
    exceptions  in  section  91(2).  The  concentration   placed   by   the
    Immigration Judge on the issue of whether there were in  truth  one  or
    two courses led him to miss the point the respondent was making in  the
    explanatory statement. The respondent had not chosen to  focus  on  the
    IELTS English course for some capricious reason. He did so  because  he
    did not consider that the appellant had been  "accepted"  on  the  GCSE
    course.

15.  Given that the  issue  of  what  is  meant  by  "accepted"  in  section
    92(1)(a) and also, of course, paragraph 57(i) of HC 395  is  a  crucial
    one in this case, it is regrettable that at neither stage of the appeal
    process has either party drawn to the Tribunal's  attention  the  first
    footnote to paragraph 9.36 of Macdonald's Immigration Law and  Practice
    (6th Edition). This  states  that  'A  conditional  acceptance  may  be
    insufficient'.  Two cases cited are  stated  as  authorities  for  that
    proposition: Chinwo v Secretary of State for the Home Department [1985]
    Imm  AR  74  and  Youshani  [1984]  (3181).   Those  cases  dealt  with
    paragraphs 21 and 107 of the former HC 169.    Paragraph 21 required  a
    passenger seeking entry to study in the United Kingdom to  satisfy  the
    Entry Clearance Officer 'that he has been  accepted  for  a  course  of
    study  at  a  university,  a   polytechnic   or   further   educational
    establishment, in an  independent  school  or  any  bona  fide  private
    education institution'.  Paragraph 107 required a student  or  would-be
    student who applied for variation of leave for the purpose of study, to
    produce evidence 'that he is enrolled for a full-time course of daytime
    study which meets the requirements for admission as a student'.

16.  In Youshani the Immigration Appeal Tribunal had to  consider  the  case
    of a person who was intending to enter the College of Law. The IAT held
    that, whenever the point might be at which the appellant could be  said
    to be  'enrolled'  on  the  course  offered  by  the  College,  it  was
    definitely not at a time when he lacked a  'guaranteed'  place  on  the
    course  because  he  had  yet  to  give  the  College   his   completed
    'confirmation form'.

17.   In Chinwo, much of the IAT's determination is taken up with the  issue
    of whether there was any  difference  between  the  concepts  of  being
    accepted and being  enrolled.    The  Tribunal  declined  to  interpret
    'enrolled' more restrictively than 'accepted'. What is plain,  however,
    from the determination is that neither a conditional enrolment nor,  it
    would appear, a  conditional  acceptance  could  entitle  a  person  to
    succeed under paragraph 21 or paragraph 107.  At page 81, the  Tribunal
    held:

             'To make sense of the rule as applicable to students and would-
             be students, in our view the requirement of "enrolled" has  to
             be read as entitlement to a confirmed place on a course  which
             satisfies the rule.   An  offer  of  a  place,  subject  to  a
             condition to be performed prior to confirmation, would not  be
             satisfying the requirements.'

18.  At page 83, the Tribunal found that 'the rule can only  make  sense  if
    "enrolled" is taken to mean the holding of an  unconditional  confirmed
    place on a course'.

19.  In this Tribunal's view, the analogy sought to be  made  by  Ms  Taylor
    between the present case and that of a student progressing, subject  to
    satisfactory performance, from one year to the next of a degree  course
    is a false one.  On the facts of this case, the better analogy is  that
    of a person being given a conditional offer by a university,  dependent
    upon that person obtaining particular grades at 'A'  level.     On  any
    reading of the letter of 24 June 2005 from New College Nottingham,  the
    appellant's acceptance on the GCSE programme was  conditional;  indeed,
    the third paragraph expressly  refers  to  her  having  'a  conditional
    offer'.  The Immigration Judge should have looked at  the  two  courses
    for which the appellant had sought entry  to  the  United  Kingdom  and
    asked himself whether she had been 'accepted' on them for the  purposes
    of the Rules.  As a  matter  of  statutory  interpretation,  'accepted'
    should, the Tribunal finds, be given its ordinary meaning. It cannot be
    equated with holding 'a conditional offer'.  If  the  drafters  of  the
    Rules and the 2002 Act had intended to cover such a  case,  they  could
    easily  have  done  so.   Accordingly,  the  appellant  had  not   been
    'accepted' for the GCSE course.

20.  It might be said that, since 1985, the relevant  Rules  have  developed
    in such a way that a different interpretation should be now placed upon
    the word 'accepted' in paragraph 57(i) and, by extension, section 91(1)
    of the 2002 Act.  In all cases, the would-be student must show that  he
    or she  'is  able  and  intends  to  follow'  the  course  in  question
    (paragraph 57(ii)).   Ought,  therefore,  a  conditional  offer  to  be
    equated with acceptance for a  course  of  study,  with  the  issue  of
    whether the condition will be satisfied left to  be  dealt  with  under
    paragraph 57(ii)?  In the present case, the Immigration Judge might  be
    said to have adopted such a line, albeit unwittingly, in  finding  that
    it was 'reasonably likely  that  the  appellant  will,  in  any  event,
    successfully pass the initial one-month course'.

21.    Leaving  aside  what  appears   to   be   the   application   of   an
    inappropriately low standard of proof on the part  of  the  Immigration
    Judge, the Tribunal considers that the  answer  to  the  question  just
    posed must be in the negative.    Not only would such an interpretation
    fly in the face of the plain meaning of the  words  used  in  paragraph
    57(i); it  would  also  cast  judicial  fact-finders  in  the  role  of
    prognosticators on a wide range of matters.  To some extent, of course,
    this is already the result of paragraph 57(ii).  Nevertheless, it would
    require far clearer language than what  we  see  in  paragraph  57,  as
    currently drafted,  to  enable  judicial  fact-finders,  such  as  this
    Tribunal, to engage in speculation as to what grade a person  might  or
    might not achieve in an examination that has  still  to  be  taken,  or
    whether a prior  course  will  be  successfully  completed,  where  the
    education institution concerned has itself felt unable to  assume  that
    the candidate is so  gifted  as  to  make  it  unnecessary  to  require
    objective evidence of her ability, whether through passing examinations
    at a particular grade or completing prior courses. In this  regard,  it
    must be borne in mind that section 85(5)(b) of the  2002  Act  requires
    the Tribunal, in entry clearance cases such as this, to  consider  only
    the circumstances appertaining at the time of the decision to refuse.

22.  Finally, the Tribunal must deal with the  possible  argument  that,  if
    the IELTS course and the GCSE course were looked at  as  a  whole,  the
    appellant did, after all, both have a right of appeal and  satisfy  the
    requirement of paragraph 57(1), in that she had been 'accepted' for the
    English course, in the sense required by paragraph 19 above,  and  that
    course and the GCSE course, looked at together, would  last  more  than
    six months.  However, as we have already seen, the correspondence  from
    New College Nottingham does not present the two courses as a  composite
    one, with the IELTS acting merely as a  type  of  'foundation'  course.
    Scoring 5.5 in the IELTS examination, following the short IELTS English
    course, is, in reality, the condition precedent to being able to  start
    the GCSE course, just as obtaining two 'A' grades at 'A' Level  is  the
    condition precedent  to  starting  a  university  course,  following  a
    conditional offer in those terms.  But, even if the two courses were to
    be regarded as one, the appellant still  failed  to  satisfy  paragraph
    57(1) and fell within section 91(1) because she had not been  'accepted
    for' that course; only for part of it.

23.   Ms Harris asked whether the Tribunal would record that, in  the  event
    of the appeal being dismissed, there had  been  an  acceptance  by  the
    Presenting Officer at the hearing before the Immigration Judge that, on
    the evidence adduced by the appellant, she had shown that she satisfied
    the maintenance and accommodation aspects of the Rules.

24.  The determination of the Immigration Judge contains  a  material  error
    of law and the Tribunal accordingly substitutes for it  a  decision  of
    its own, dismissing the appellant's appeal for want of jurisdiction.
