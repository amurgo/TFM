               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr P Richardson
For the Respondent:    Mr T Lindsay


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is the appellant's  appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Taylor promulgated on 9 May  2019  dismissing  on  human
    rights grounds the appeal against the  decision  of  the  Secretary  of
    State dated 30 January  2019  to  refuse  the  application  made  on  8
    February 2018 for indefinite leave to  remain  on  the  basis  of  long
    residence.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Fisher granted permission  to  appeal  on  11
    June 2019 on the basis that the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  failed  to
    determine how the discretion under paragraph 322(5) should be exercised
    and that in turn infected the judge's approach to Article 8.  The judge
    granting permission  also  considered  it  arguable  that  the  judge's
    conclusions on Article 8 at paragraph 28 of the impugned  decision  was
    inadequate.  With respect to Judge Fisher, I disagree.

 3. At the outset, I have to decide whether or not there was  an  error  of
    law in the making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal, such that
    the decision of Judge Taylor should be set aside.  That requires me  to
    determine whether there was an error of law and, if so, whether it  was
    material.

 4. It is common ground that the appellant came to the  UK  in  2007  as  a
    student.  His leave was later extended to June of  2016  as  a  Tier  1
    General Migrant.  In June of 2016 he made an  application  for  further
    leave to remain refused in December 2017 with no right of appeal but  a
    right of administrative review which was exercised.  The  decision  was
    maintained after the administrative review on 28 January 2018,  on  the
    basis of the appellant's alleged dishonesty between declarations as  to
    HMRC and UKVI, either/or.  All that relates back to an application made
    in April 2011.  It is submitted that on the basis of admission provided
    in that application there were discrepancies between what the appellant
    had declared to HMRC as his income and the income which he declared  to
    UKVI in that application.  The  respondent's  position  is  either  the
    appellant under-declared his income to HMRC or over-inflated his income
    for the purposes of making an application.  The  respondent  considered
    all of that in 2017 and refused  the  application  on  that  basis  and
    maintained that refusal after administrative review.

 5. As a result of, whilst the appellant had valid  leave  between  October
    2007 and January 2018, a period of just over ten years, the  respondent
    refused the application on the basis of 276B(iii) and paragraph 322(5),
    the general grounds for refusal, because of his  dishonesty  in  either
    business and tax affairs or in the declarations made to UKVI and on the
    basis of the undesirability of permitting the person to remain  in  the
    UK in the light of his conduct, character or associations.

 6. The grounds cover three aspects:-

      1) whether the  discretion  was  properly  exercised,  either  by  the
         Secretary of State or by the judge in  considering  the  matter  on
         appeal in the impugned decision;

      2) whether Article 8 was properly considered; and

      3) whether the judge had properly decided whether the first stage  had
         been reached at all.

 7. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal was promulgated on 9  May  2019
    which was before the decision of the  Court  of  Appeal  in  Balajigari
    [2019] EWCA Civ 673.  In that case it was held  that  before  making  a
    decision based on dishonesty in such cases  as  a  discrepancy  between
    HMRC  and  UKVI  the  respondent  has  to  provide  the  appellant  the
    opportunity  to  put  his  innocent   explanation   forward   for   the
    discrepancy, and it was also held that administrative review was not  a
    sufficient remedy for that.  Very fairly, Mr Richardson anticipated  Mr
    Lindsay's submission that on the facts of this case that issue does not
    arise because at the time he made his application on  8  February  2018
    the appellant was fully aware of  the  allegation  of  discrepancy  and
    therefore, as Mr Richardson concedes, had the full opportunity  to  put
    his  explanation  for  any  discrepancy  to  the  respondent   in   the
    application to which this appeal relates, and of course that could also
    have been considered by the First-tier Tribunal Judge.

 8. Mr Richardson puts the appellant's case in a different way, not relying
    on that matter but relying on a suggestion that the judge had to make a
    decision, one way or the other, as to what it was  that  the  appellant
    had done, whether he had been dishonest  with  HMRC  or  he  had  over-
    inflated his income to UKVI.  With respect to Mr Richardson, I  do  not
    accept that argument, and as appears from the Balajigari case it  seems
    that the Secretary of State is entitled to say that it is  one  or  the
    other and it is not necessary for the respondent or the Tribunal  judge
    to make a definitive determination whether it was an over-inflation  or
    an under-declaration;  either the appellant was dishonest with HMRC, or
    he over-inflated his income to UKVI.  Either way, and it must be one of
    the two, the respondent was entitled  to  conclude  that  he  had  been
    dishonest and therefore that  brought  him  within  the  ambit  of  the
    application of paragraph 322(5) and, of course, 276B. I thus reject  as
    not sustainable the argument that the judge erred in  failing  to  make
    such a decision between HMRC and UKVI.  At paragraph 21 of the decision
    the judge made clear that  there  has  been  a  significant  difference
    between the income declared to HMRC and the declarations to UKVI.   The
    discrepancy amounted to over ï¿½29,000.  The judge  gave  cogent  reasons
    for concluding that this was no coincidence,  that  the  income  figure
    submitted for the immigration application would have scored  sufficient
    points under the Immigration Rules, whereas the tax return figure would
    not have.   The  judge  considered  the  appellant's  explanations  and
    rejected them giving cogent reasons for doing so.

 9. I have been referred by both representatives to paragraph 37(2) of  the
    Balajigari case in which the Court of Appeal  considered  three  points
    about the issue of dishonesty in the context of an earnings discrepancy
    case.  In that paragraph it was submitted that even  dishonest  conduct
    may not be sufficiently reprehensible to justify the use  of  paragraph
    322(5) in all cases and it was said  that  that  would  depend  on  the
    circumstances.  The Court of  Appeal  accepted  that  as  a  matter  of
    principle dishonest conduct will not always and in every case  reach  a
    sufficient level of seriousness, but in  the  context  of  an  earnings
    discrepancy case it is very hard to see, they said, how the  deliberate
    and dishonest submission of false earning figures, whether to  HMRC  or
    to the Home Office, would not do so.

10. Mr Lindsay relies on that extract from the Balajigari case  to  suggest
    that it is not necessary for the Secretary of State to make a  separate
    discretion  exercise,  but  I  accept  Mr  Richardson's  argument  that
    paragraph 37(2) relates to whether to apply paragraph  322(5)  at  all,
    which is how Mr Richardson explained the two  stages  that  had  to  be
    considered. First, whether 322(5) applies at all and, if it  does,  the
    second stage, because it is a presumption and there is discretion to be
    exercised whether to apply 322(5) to refuse the application. He rightly
    points out that the second stage is referred to  in  paragraph  38  and
    also in paragraph 39 of the Balajigari case. In  the  circumstances,  I
    must reject Mr Richardson's argument that  it  is  all  encompassed  in
    37(2). In paragraph 38 the Court of Appeal said:-

         "While we would not say that it would always be an error of law for
         a  decision-maker  to  fail  to  conduct  the  balancing   exercise
         explicitly, we agree  that  it  would  be  good  practice  for  the
         Secretary of State to incorporate it in his formal  decision-making
         process".

    In other words, a failure of good practice does not necessarily  amount
    to an error of law, as is clear the Court of Appeal was saying.

11. The argument put forward on behalf of the appellant  in  the  Court  of
    Appeal case was that the Secretary of State  must  separately  consider
    whether, notwithstanding the conclusion that it was undesirable for the
    appellant to have leave to remain that there were  factors  outweighing
    the presumption that leave should, for that reason, be refused.  It was
    submitted that at this stage the Secretary of State must consider  such
    factors as the welfare of any minor child who may be affected adversely
    by the decision, and any human rights issue which arise.  However,  the
    Court of Appeal whilst stating that that seemed correct  in  principle,
    stated:-

         "There will, though no doubt only exceptionally, be cases where the
         interests of children or others, or serious problems about  removal
         to their country of origin, mean that it would be wrong  to  refuse
         leave to remain (though not necessarily indefinite leave to remain)
         to migrants whose presence is undesirable".

    This case was of course an application for indefinite leave  to  remain
    on the basis of long residence.  I read that part of  the  decision  of
    Balajigari as  stating  that  only  really  where  there  were  factors
    exceptionally which would justify granting leave to  remain  could  the
    decision refusing leave on the basis of paragraph 322(5) be  challenged
    and they doubted whether it  could  be  challenged  in  relation  to  a
    decision to refuse indefinite leave to remain.

12. In this regard I note that at paragraph  28  the  judge  recorded  that
    there were no submissions by  the  appellant's  representative  at  the
    First-tier Tribunal in relation to  human  rights  outside  the  Rules,
    obviously, and within the Rules in relation  to  long  residence.   The
    judge said it was not submitted, nor is it clear, that  there  are  any
    exceptional circumstances in this case, and  indeed  any  compassionate
    factors which should be taken into account.  It follows from that  that
    no such factors were advanced by the appellant or  on  the  appellant's
    behalf.

13. This takes me to the third  point  of  Mr  Richardson's  argument.   He
    claims the judge erred in failing to  conduct  an  adequate  Article  8
    assessment, however where there were  no  submissions  in  relation  to
    Article 8, I do not see that that point can be pursued.  The  judge  is
    not obliged to decide Article 8 where a represented appellant  did  not
    pursue Article 8 ECHR outside the Rules at all. That brings me back  to
    the second stage, the exercise of discretion.  There was nothing on the
    facts of this case  advanced  on  the  appellant's  behalf  to  justify
    exercising the discretion to grant leave to remain indefinitely outside
    of, or in the light of, application of paragraph 322(5).

14. In the circumstances I am not satisfied that there was an error of  law
    by the First-tier Tribunal, but if there was an error of  law,  in  the
    light of the post-decision Court of Appeal decision of Balajigari, then
    I am satisfied it was not material to the outcome of the case, in other
    words, the  decision  would  have  been  exactly  the  same;  namely  a
    dismissal of the appeal.

Notice of Decision

15. The making of the decision the First-tier Tribunal did not involve  the
    making of a material error of law, such that the decision should be set
    aside.

                    I do not set aside the  decision  and  the  appeal  will
                    remain dismissed.

                    No anonymity direction is made.
