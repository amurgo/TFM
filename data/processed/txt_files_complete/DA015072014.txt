               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr. M Jaufurally
For the Respondent:    Mr. S Whitwell, HOPO

                          DECISION ON ERROR OF LAW


1.   The appellant appeals with leave against the decision of First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Chana dismissing his appeal against the decision of the
    respondent dated 3 July 2014 to issue a Deportation Order, pursuant to
    section 3(5)(a) of the Immigration Act 1971.  The respondent concluded,
    following his 14 convictions for 18 offences since 2000, and having
    assessed his character and conduct in the round, that the appellant's
    deportation would be conducive to the public good.

2.   The judge erred in law in applying the automatic deportation
    provisions under the UK Borders Act 2007 when it is clear from
    paragraph 1 above that this was not the basis of the respondent's
    decision to deport the appellant.

3.   The judge's decision is materially flawed and cannot stand.  I set
    aside the judge's decision.

4.   The appellant's appeal is remitted to Taylor House for rehearing by a
    First-tier Judge other than FtTJ Chana.
