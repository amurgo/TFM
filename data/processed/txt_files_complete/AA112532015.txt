Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Tufan
For the Respondent:    Ms Benitez


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department
    against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal allowing the appeal  of
    [IS] against the Secretary of State's decision to refuse him asylum  on
    account of his sexual orientation.  For the purposes of this  decision,
    I shall refer to the Secretary of State as "the Respondent" and to [IS]
    as "the Appellant" reflecting their positions as they were  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

 2. I have considered whether the Appellant requires the protection  of  an
    anonymity direction.  No anonymity direction  was  made  previously  in
    respect of him and no application was made before  me  for  one  to  be
    granted.  I do not consider it necessary therefore to make an anonymity
    direction.

Background

 3. The Appellant is  a  male  born  [  ]  1991  in  Bangladesh.  He  is  a
    homosexual. His claim is that in 2008 he was arrested in a  hotel  room
    after a police raid.  He was found with his  homosexual  partner.   The
    police also found alcohol and drugs (heroin) in the room.  Towards  the
    end of 2012, he was sentenced to four years imprisonment in respect  of
    the illicit sexual activity and the alcohol and heroin found.  By  this
    time however he had left Bangladesh and  entered  the  United  Kingdom.
    His family disowned him  but  his  claim  he  was  able  to  sell  some
    inherited family land to a brother and this realised  enough  money  to
    fund his trip to the UK.

 4. The Appellant arrived in the UK on 16th October 2010 in possession of a
    student visa which was valid until December 2012.  On 17th  April  2014
    he applied for an extension of the student visa. This  application  was
    refused by the Respondent on 19th March 2015.

 5. On 13th February 2015 therefore he claimed asylum on the grounds of his
    sexuality.  He also claimed that he had atheist  beliefs  and  did  not
    believe in Islam because it was against homosexuality.

 6. The Respondent refused the Appellant's claim on several counts.

       . She was not satisfied that the Appellant was homosexual as claimed;
         nor that he had  been  arrested  in  Bangladesh  as  claimed.   The
         Respondent considered that the Appellant had  not  shown  that  the
         documents he relied upon which included  a  newspaper  article  and
         various copy court documents following his arrest, were reliable.

       . She considered that the Appellant had provided  vague  and  limited
         details  concerning  his  experiences  in  the   UK   including   a
         relationship with a man called [AA] which lasted six months.

       . She noted that the Appellant had remained in Bangladesh for  almost
         a year following his claimed arrest and had provided  a  number  of
         inconsistent statements regarding family land which he said he  had
         sold in order to fund his entry to the UK.

       . There was a general credibility difficulty  for  the  Appellant  in
         that he entered the United Kingdom in 2010 as a  student  but  only
         claimed asylum in 2015 after his application for extension  of  his
         student visa was refused.

 7. Following the Respondent's refusal of his  application,  the  Appellant
    appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.

The FtT Hearing and Decision

 8. When the appeal came before the FtT, the judge identified at [40]  that
    he had to make a finding whether the Appellant is a homosexual. He also
    identified that once that assessment was made, he had to decide whether
    there was a real risk to the Appellant on account of his homosexuality,
    in returning to Bangladesh.

 9. The judge also identified that the Respondent did not accept

       . that the Appellant's homosexuality was made out [45] on  the  basis
         that the claimed conviction and arrest was for  drugs  and  alcohol
         offences rather than homosexuality. The provenance of the documents
         to support the conviction was doubtful.

       . that the Appellant's claim  was  a  credible.  He  had  delayed  in
         claiming asylum - his claim being made some four and a  half  years
         after he first entered the UK.

10. However after consideration of those matters,  the  judge  allowed  the
    appeal.

11. The Respondent sought permission to  appeal  the  FtTs  decision.   The
    grounds seeking permission took issue  with  the  judge's  analysis  at
    [46].  It was said he had wrongly reversed the  burden  of  proof  when
    dealing with the documentary evidence produced by the Appellant and had
    not had regard to the case law of Tanveer Ahmed IAT [2002] UKIAT 00439.
     It was further claimed that  the  FtT  had  not  given  sufficient  or
    adequate reason for accepting the Appellant's oral evidence and  failed
    to  give  proper  findings  on  whether  the  documents  produced  were
    reliable.

12. Permission was granted, the relevant parts of which are set out below:

         "The application for permission to appeal asserts that  the  burden
         of proof regarding documents is wrongly reversed  at  ï¿½46;  Tanveer
         Ahmed -v- SSHD (2002) UKIAT  00439  not  applied  relative  to  the
         appellant's core account that he had  been  taken  to  court  under
         arrest.

         It is arguable that he documentary evidence  of  court  proceedings
         have not been taken  in  the  round  as  required  by  the  starred
         determination of Tanveer Ahmed -v- SSHD (2002) UKIAT 00439."

    Thus the matter comes before me to decide whether  the  FTT's  decision
    discloses a material error of law requiring it to  set  aside  and  the
    decision re-made.

Error of Law Hearing

13. I heard submissions  from  both  representatives.   Mr  Tufan  for  the
    Respondent relied on  the  grounds  seeking  permission  but  helpfully
    indicated that there was no issue with the Appellant's  sexuality.   He
    submitted that the judge's findings on the  documentary  evidence  were
    unsustainable.  That evidence goes  to  the  core  of  the  Appellant's
    claim.  It is for the Appellant to show that  the  documents  could  be
    relied upon.  There is insufficient reasoning to show why the documents
    produced should be relied upon.

14. In addition, he submitted, the  judge  found  the  Appellant  to  be  a
    credible witness, but there must be a  large  question  mark  over  the
    Appellant's credibility under Section 8 of the Asylum  and  Immigration
    Act 2004.  It took the Appellant four and a half years, after  entering
    the UK, to claim asylum.  In these circumstances the  decision  of  the
    FTT is unsustainable.

15. Ms Benitez responded by relying on a skeleton argument.  The thrust  of
    her argument is that the Appellant is a homosexual and  this  fact  has
    now been accepted  by  the  Respondent.  Homosexuality  is  a  criminal
    offence in Bangladesh under S.377 of the  penal  code.   Whilst  it  is
    accepted that the section is seldom invoked,  it  is  used  to  harass,
    threaten  and  suppress  the  gay  community  in  Bangladesh.   Amnesty
    International has reported that it is unsafe for homosexuals to conduct
    themselves openly in that country.

Error of Law Consideration

16. The Secretary of State challenges the FtT's failure to  deal  with  the
    documentary evidence produced by the Appellant, in accordance with  the
    principles of Tanveer Ahmed.  At [44] the judge said

         "At base,  however,  I  accept  the  Appellant's  account;  nothing
         submitted from the Respondent  casts  doubt  upon  the  Appellant's
         credibility."

    Further at [46] the judge said

         "Given  my  findings  in  relation  to   the   Appellant's   sexual
         orientation, I proceed to look at what is likely to happen  to  the
         Appellant in the event of his return to Bangladesh.  The  Appellant
         has been convicted before a criminal court  in  Bangladesh.   There
         are scant details of that conviction.  However, the Appellant  gave
         an account of his arrest and subsequent  appearance  in  court.   I
         accept that account.  The  documents  submitted,  said  to  support
         that, are not the most impressive but they do not,  as  such,  cast
         doubt on the Appellant's account.  The  Respondent  submitted  that
         the conviction was for criminal conduct not solely related  to  the
         Appellant's sexual orientation.  I am of the  view  that  the  fact
         that other charges  feature  in  the  Appellant's  prosecution  and
         conviction is nothing to the point.   There  is  a  conviction  for
         conduct related to  his  sexual  orientation.   That  fact  is  not
         detracted from because  other  charges  featured  in  the  criminal
         process."

17. I am not persuaded that the judge has fallen  into  the  error  to  the
    extent that the decision must be set  aside  and  re-made.  i  give  my
    reasons for that finding.

18. It is clear from a  full  reading  of  the  decision,  that  the  judge
    conducted a lengthy oral hearing.  He has written an extremely detailed
    and thorough decision.  He identified at [40] what he was tasked to do.
     The core of this appeal rests on the Appellant's credibility.

19. The Respondent doubted that the Appellant was  homosexual  as  claimed.
    The judge devotes  three  substantive  paragraphs  from  [41]  to  [43]
    setting out why he reached a finding that he believed  the  Appellant's
    claim of homosexuality.  That finding is one which was  fully  reasoned
    and as Mr Tufan helpfully conceded, the Appellant's sexuality is not in
    issue now.  It is also clear from those paragraphs that  the  Appellant
    was cross-examined in detail by the Respondent.  Having  taken  account
    of all that evidence, the judge concluded, as he was  entitled  to  do,
    that the Appellant's story  was  a  credible  one.   There  is  nothing
    perverse in that reasoning.

20. Having established that the Appellant is a homosexual, the  judge  then
    directed himself to the question  of  whether  it  was  safe  for  this
    Appellant to return to Bangladesh.  He decided it was not.

21. Whilst the judge may be criticised for badly expressing himself at [44]
    the substance of  this  case  is  that  the  judge  believed  that  the
    Appellant had given a credible account of his circumstances leading  to
    his arrest and conviction [42]. Throughout his decision the judge makes
    findings that the Appellant's credibility is not in doubt.

22. So far as any risk on return is concerned the Respondent's position  is
    that although homosexual acts remain illegal in Bangladesh, in practice
    the law  is  rarely  enforced.   The  judge  found  otherwise  in  this
    Appellant's  case.   He  had  regard  to   the   extensive   background
    documentation which was produced, but in addition he took into  account
    the Appellant's history of his arrest/conviction.   The  judge  carried
    out a detailed analysis of that evidence and I find that, in substance,
    the judge's error in badly expressing himself as  regards  the  Tanveer
    Ahmed principle, simply does not vitiate his reasoning for  finding  as
    he does.  It follows therefore that this does not justify setting aside
    his decision.  It would be wholly disproportionate to do so.

23. In these circumstances, I dismiss the Secretary of State's  appeal  and
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands.


Notice of Decision

The Secretary of State's appeal is dismissed.  The decision  of  the  First-
tier Tribunal allowing  [IS]'s  appeal  against  the  Secretary  of  State's
refusal to grant him asylum, stands.

No anonymity direction is made.
