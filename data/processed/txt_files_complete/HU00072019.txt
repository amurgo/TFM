                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against a determination of First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    Cassel, promulgated on 25th March 2019, following a hearing  at  Taylor
    House on 7th March 2019.  In the determination, the judge  allowed  the
    appeal of the Appellant, whereupon the Respondent Secretary  of  State,
    subsequently applied for, and was granted, permission to appeal to  the
    Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Pakistan, and was  born  on  29th
    November 1981.  He appealed against  the  decision  of  the  Respondent
    dated 6th December 2018, refusing his application for indefinite  leave
    to remain in the United Kingdom on the basis of ten  years'  continuous
    long residence.  The basis of the  refusal  was  that  under  paragraph
    322(5) there was evidence of deceit committed by the Appellant with  HM
    Revenue & Customs, in relation to the Appellant's tax affairs, and that
    it was not conducive to the public good to allow him to remain  in  the
    United Kingdom.

The Judge's Findings

 3. The judge's findings are based upon two essential matters.  First,  the
    judge considered that as  far  as  the  Appellant's  tax  affairs  were
    concerned, it came to the Appellant's attention  prior  to  making  his
    application for indefinite leave to remain,  that  there  had  been  an
    error made by his accountant in the submission of his tax  returns  for
    2010 to 2011.  The Appellant explained that  this  had  been  rectified
    with the HMRC.  Significantly in this case, there was a letter (at page
    20 of the Appellant's bundle) from his accountant, Ashton Coopers & Co,
    in which his accountant acknowledged that the error had been made by  a
    member of their staff who had been  dealing  with  the  accounts  of  a
    different client who had a similar name to  the  Appellant.   In  these
    circumstances,  it  had  been  contended  before  the  judge  that  the
    Appellant could not be treated as one whose presence in the UK was  not
    conducive to the public good.

 4. Second, the judge noted how the Appellant had applied for leave on  5th
    July 2016 and that the Respondent had treated the application as  being
    out of time so that it was in breach of the Appellant's valid leave  by
    one day, but there was evidence before the  judge  of  posting  of  the
    application on 4th July 2016 (see paragraphs 4 to 5).

 5. The judge did not find either of the two matters  above  to  have  been
    against the Appellant.  His conclusion  was  that  both  the  Appellant
    sought advice  from  his  legal  representatives  obtaining  supporting
    documentation in or around March 2016.  The purpose of the legal advice
    was the assistance of an application  to  the  Respondent  for  further
    leave to remain:-

         "At that stage it came to light that an error had been made in  the
         accounts submitted to HM Revenue and  Customs  and  the  error  was
         rectified on the initiative of the Appellant.  There is no evidence
         whatsoever that points to  any  culpability  on  the  part  of  the
         Appellant  and  he  has  been  entirely  credible  and   consistent
         throughout" (paragraph 11).

 6. That dealt with the question of whether the Appellant had in fact  been
    guilty  of  dishonesty  in  violation  of  paragraph  322(5)   of   the
    Immigration Rules.




 7. Third, the additional matter was as to whether the Appellant had fallen
    foul of his married leave to remain by one day, and in this regard, the
    judge noted that "the application to the Respondent was  sent  in  time
    under the  provisions  of  Rule  34G(i)  and  there  was  no  break  in
    continuity in valid  leave.   I  find  that  the  Appellant  meets  the
    requirements of paragraph 276B" (see paragraph 11).

 8. The appeal was allowed.

Grounds of Application

 9. The grounds of application state that the judge has simply accepted  at
    face value what the Appellant had to say in relation to  incorrect  tax
    returns during 2010 to 2011, which were not  discovered  by  him  until
    many years later in 2016 when he made his  application  for  indefinite
    leave to remain.  This could not have been credible and did not  excuse
    the Appellant's liability for checking the tax returns before he signed
    them off.  In particular, the judge had failed to have  regard  to  the
    decision in Khan v. SSHD (Dishonesty,  tax  return,  paragraph  322(5))
    [2018] UKUT 384, which required  a  consideration  of  the  Appellant's
    motive and failure  to  act,  as  matters  that  the  Tribunal  had  to
    consider.

10. On 17th April 2019 permission to appeal was granted.

Submissions

11. At the hearing before me on 10th June 2019, Miss  Aboni,  appearing  on
    behalf  of  the  Secretary  of  State,  relied  upon  the  grounds   of
    application.  In particular, she  emphasised  the  importance  of  Khan
    [2018] UKUT 384, which the judge had not followed in this case.  It was
    not explained by the judge why the  Appellant  had  not  realised  this
    error earlier.  It was not explained why he had been able to sign off a
    tax return which was so  plainly  incorrect.   The  difference  in  the
    figures was quite stark.  It was the difference between some �45,000 as
    declared compared to �20,068.  There would have been an impact in terms
    of the amount of tax that the Appellant would have had to pay on  this.
    The matter ought to have been properly considered by the judge.  It was
    not.  The judge simply took at face value what  the  Appellant  stated.
    It was also a matter of complete irrelevance that the HMRC did not take
    further action against the Appellant.  Yet, the judge placed some value
    on that.

12. For his part, Mr  Hodgetts,  relied  upon  his  well-compiled  Rule  24
    response and skeleton argument.  He submitted that the case of Khan was
    not relied upon by the Presenting Officer.  It did not  modify  binding
    Court of Appeal authority on the duty to give reasons.   If  there  was
    reasons to challenge  then  the  party  making  the  challenge  had  to
    establish that each of the points now relied upon  were  raised  before
    the judge.  This was not the case when one looks at how the  Presenting
    Officer put his case (see the refusal letter at paragraph 9).   It  was
    not correct to say that the judge failed to  make  any  finding  as  to
    whether  the  accountant's  explanation  was  credible  or  not.    The
    accountant himself provided evidence of his error.  The  judge  had  in
    mind the accountant's letter and explanation (see  paragraph  4).   The
    judge took into account the documentary evidence  and  the  Appellant's
    oral evidence and statement (see paragraphs 8 and 11).  The  judge  had
    accepted the Appellant's oral evidence as credible and consistent  (see
    paragraph 11).  The Secretary of State today had made no  challenge  to
    the credibility findings of the judge in relation to the Appellant.  It
    was these circumstances that the judge  had  correctly  concluded  that
    "there is no evidence" of dishonesty or "culpability" on  the  part  of
    the Appellant.  That was a finding that the judge was entitled to  come
    to on the evidence before him.  Moreover, inaction on the part  of  the
    HMRC was not irrelevant, as contended by the Respondent today.

13. The Court of Appeal in Balajigari have now recently made it clear that,
    whilst it was not determinative and may have little weight, it  is  not
    irrelevant or even a neutral  factor,  that  the  HMRC  has  not  taken
    action.  It observed:-

         "If the Secretary of State adopts the 'minded to refuse'  procedure
         which we consider is necessary in this context, that will afford an
         applicant the opportunity to draw attention to  anything  relevant,
         for example what action HMRC decided to take  or  not  to  take  in
         respect of an inaccurate tax return" (paragraph 75).

14. That was the position here, submitted Mr Hodgetts.




15. In fact, in Balajigari [2019] EWCA Civ 673, the Court of Appeal had now
    confirmed (at paragraph 42) that discrepant amounts between  a  Tier  1
    application and HMRC returns do not in themselves justify a finding  of
    dishonesty.  They are only sufficient to establish a "suspicion" of the
    same.  In this case, that suspicion had been dispelled by the fact that
    Ashton Coopers, the accountants, had themselves in a  letter  (at  page
    20) apologised to the Appellant and given him a full  reimbursement  of
    fees paid for that year, and in mitigating their error,  also  did  not
    charge him for the accounts for 2015 to  2016  tax  year,  and  made  a
    detailed explanation of the error.  It was an error  committed  in  one
    year only.  Indeed, Ashton Cooper  were  referred  to  in  the  refusal
    letter itself as "reputable chartered accountants" (see  paragraph  6),
    and so if they had owned up to the fact that the error was by them,  it
    could hardly be said  that  this  in  itself  did  not  mean  that  the
    Secretary of State did not have to prove dishonesty on the part of  the
    Appellant.  The Secretary of State had failed to do so.

No Error of Law

16. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1)  of
    TCEA 2007) such that I should set aside the  decision  and  remake  the
    decision.  My reasons are as  follows.   This  is  a  case  where,  the
    Appellant was cross-examined by the Presenting Officer at the  hearing,
    and he had explained that his tax returns had been amended, following a
    mistake of his accountant, and an additional tax payment had been  made
    of some �7,567.20, which was paid on 10th June 2016 (see paragraph 8 of
    the determination).  This is a case where the judge had regard  to  the
    fact that an innocent explanation for an apparent dishonesty  had  been
    advanced (paragraph 9).

17. Most importantly, this is a case where  the  judge  was  clear  in  his
    findings that "There is no  evidence  whatsoever  that  points  to  any
    culpability on the part of the  Appellant  and  he  has  been  entirely
    credible and consistent throughout" (paragraph 11).  These conclusions,
    come in the wake of a full and frank admission of  culpability  on  the
    part of  the  Appellant's  own  accountants,  described  as  "reputable
    chartered accountants", by the name  of  Ashton  Coopers,  to  such  an
    extent that they  have  reimbursed  the  Appellant  of  his  fees,  and
    undertaken to do his accounts for the years 2015 to 2016 as well.

18. It is significant that they were the Appellant's accountants right from
    the outset, and the explanation that they have given is that they mixed
    up his name with somebody else of the same name.  That is not something
    which is beyond the bounds of all possibility.  It  is  something  that
    was accepted by the judge as having in this case taken place.

19. Ultimately, the threshold under paragraph 322(5) is a high one, and the
    Respondent Secretary of State failed to demonstrate that the  Appellant
    had actually been guilty of deceit and dishonesty, especially  when  an
    innocent explanation had been  provided  by  the  Appellant,  that  was
    backed up by documentary evidence from his accountants.   The  decision
    was one that was open to the judge to make.

Notice of Decision

20. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the  making  of
    an error on a point of law.  The decision shall stand.

21. No anonymity direction is made.
