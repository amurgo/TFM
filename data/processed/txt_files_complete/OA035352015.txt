Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms R Nagesh, of Counsel, instructed by Lawrence
Lupin Solicitors.
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. Upper Tribunal Judge Freeman (UTJ Freeman)  granted  the  appellant,  a
    national of Sudan born on 17 March 1992, permission to  appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal, on a limited point (as explained below), to challenge a
    decision of Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  Lagunju  (hereafter  the
    "judge") who, in a determination promulgated on 15 June 2016  following
    a hearing on 13 April 2016, dismissed her appeal under the  Immigration
    Rules (hereafter the "Rules") and on human rights grounds  against  the
    respondent's decision of 15 January 2015 to refuse her application  for
    entry clearance as the spouse of a person present and  settled  in  the
    United Kingdom, a Mr Abdullah Ahmadoun Mohammed Khair (the  "sponsor").
    The sponsor is a British citizen.

 2.  The  respondent  refused  the  appellant's  application   because   he
    considered that the appellant did not satisfy the following:

    i)      The  appellant  did  not  satisfy  the  English  language  test
        requirement, although she had submitted an  English  language  test
        certificate.

    ii)     The sponsor's gross annual income fell marginally short of  the
        required threshold of �18,600. The respondent calculated  that  the
        sponsor's gross annual income was �18,599.36, i.e. a  shortfall  of
        �0.64, on the respondent's calculation.

    iii)    The sponsor had submitted photocopies of his UK bank statements
        and not the originals as required by way of "specified  documents".
        It was not disputed  before  the  judge  or  me  that  this  was  a
        reference to the requirement to submit  "specified  documents"  set
        out in Appendix FM-SE of the Rules.

 3. There were therefore three issues before the judge.

The judge's decision

 4. I will now summarise the evidence before the judge and her treatment of
    the issues before her at paras 10-19 of her decision.

 5. The judge resolved the issue regarding the appellant's English language
    test certificate in the appellant's favour (para  10).  The  respondent
    has not challenged this finding.

 6. The judge had before her the sponsor's wage slips which showed that  he
    was paid on a fortnightly basis for a fortnight's work. The first  wage
    slip was dated 17 April 2014 for work done for a fortnight, the week in
    which the wage slip was issued being the  second  week.  The  following
    details appear on the wage slips:

             Date  of  wage  slip      Week  number              Gross   pay
Gross Pay to date
            17.04.2014              2        �    715.36 �      715.36
            02.05.2014              4        �    715.36 �   1,430.72
            16.05.2014              6        �    715.36 �   2,146.08
            30.05.2014              8        �    715.36 �   2,861.44
            13.06.2014            10         �    715.36 �   3,576.80
            27.06.2014            12         �    715.36 �   4,292.16
            11.07.2014            14         �    715.36 �   5,007.52
            25.07.2014            16         �    715.36 �   5,722.88
            08.08.2014            18         �    357.68 �   6,080.56
            22.08.2014            20         � 1,073.04  �   7,153.60  *
            05.09.2014            22         �    715.36 �   7,868.96
            19.09.2014            24         �    715.36 �   8,584.32
            03.10.2014            26         �    715.36 �   9,299.68
            17.10.2014            28         �    715.36 � 10,015.04
            31.10.2014            30         �    715.36 � 10,730.40

            * This wage slip shows that a deduction of  �250  was  made  and
             which is described as "Staff Advance Dedu".

 7. The judge also had some bank statements for the sponsor's account. This
    showed that there was a  payment  to  the  sponsor  of  �250  from  his
    employers on 15 August 2014. However, the appellant had not submitted a
    wage slip which related to this payment. This was put to the sponsor at
    the hearing before the judge but  the  sponsor  insisted  that  he  had
    provided all relevant wage slips to the appellant's representatives.

 8. The Presenting Officer who represented the respondent before the  judge
    relied, inter alia, on the issue of the "missing wage" slip,  i.e.  the
    wage slip relating to the payment of �250 on 15 August 2014. Ms Nagesh,
    who appeared for the appellant  before  the  judge,  confirmed  at  the
    hearing before  me  that  she  did  not  apply  to  the  judge  for  an
    adjournment in order to obtain evidence to deal with  the  respondent's
    contention that there was a missing wage slip.

 9. To the contrary, as para 17 of the judge's decision  (which  is  quoted
    below) demonstrates, Ms Nagesh contended  before  the  judge  that  the
    respondent should have exercised his discretion under para 245AA of the
    Rules by requesting the "missing wage" slip,  arguing  that  it  formed
    part of a sequence of documents.  The  judge  rejected  that  argument,
    finding that the respondent had correctly exercised her  discretion  as
    she considered it likely that the respondent had anticipated  that  the
    application would fail for other reasons, namely failing  to  meet  the
    financial  threshold  and  failing  to  provide   the   original   bank
    statements, as required by Appendix FM-SE.

10. In relation to Appendix FM-SE, the judge considered that the  appellant
    had failed to comply with Appendix FM-SE because she had  not  provided
    originals of the sponsor's bank statements (paras  14-15)  and  because
    she had failed to submit the "missing wage" slip. As stated above,  she
    rejected  Ms  Nagesh's  submission  that  the  respondent  should  have
    exercised the discretion under para 245AA (paras 16-17).

11. In relation to the minimum income threshold, the judge found (paras 12-
    13), in essence, that the sponsor's income fell slightly short  of  the
    threshold. She said that, as there was no "near  miss"  principle,  the
    shortfall could not  be  overlooked.  She  preferred  the  respondent's
    method of calculation and rejected the method suggested by Ms Nagesh to
    calculate the sponsor's income using the day rate of �51.10  multiplied
    by 365 days in the year. Her  consideration  of  the  income  threshold
    issue is at paras 12-13 of her decision.

12. The judge therefore concluded that the appellant  failed  to  meet  the
    requirements of Appendix FM and dismissed her appeal under the Rules.

13. At para 19, the judge said  that  she  was  satisfied  that  there  was
    nothing sufficiently compelling or exceptional about  this  case  which
    requires consideration outside the Rules following SSHD  v  SS  (Congo)
    and others [2015] EWCA Civ 387.

14. Paras 11-19 of the judge's decision read:


        "11.     In relation to the financial requirements under the rules,
             the  respondent  contends  that  the  sponsor's  income  falls
             beneath the required threshold. The appellant is to show  that
             the sponsor's gross income is at least �18,600.


        12.      According to the ECO's calculation, based on a fortnightly
             wage of �715.36, the sponsor's annual income is �18,599.36.  I
             note Mr Lewis also did  the  calculation  during  the  hearing
             using the sponsor's wage slips containing in  the  bundle;  he
             reached the same conclusion.


        13.      Counsel however in her skeleton argument  and  during  her
             submissions invited me to calculate the sponsor's income using
             the day rate of �51.10 multiplied by 365  days  in  the  year.
             However I find this cannot be correct as  the  appellant  does
             not claim that the sponsor works 365 days a year. Accordingly,
             I prefer the respondent's calculations based on the wage  slip
             evidence; I find it more  accurately  reflects  the  sponsor's
             income. In light of this, although I accept  it  is  extremely
             unfortunate given how close to  the  threshold  the  sponsor's
             income comes and the length of time the appellant has  had  to
             wait for her application to be considered,  the  fact  remains
             the appellant does not meet the requirements of the rules.  As
             there is no 'near miss' principle,  the  shortfall  cannot  be
             overlooked.


        14.      There is a further defect in the  appellant's  application
             however. In line with Appendix FM-SE the appellant is required
             to produce a  number  of  documents  to  prove  the  sponsor's
             income.  These  documents  must  include   six   months   bank
             statements in the sponsor's name, along  with  six  months  of
             corresponding wage slips. The  bank  statements  must  display
             regular income deposits which correspond with the amounts  and
             dates shown on the wage slips.


      15.   The appellant has provided the  sponsor's  bank  statements  and
             wage slips covering the period between April and October  2014
             showing his  fortnightly  wage  payments  from  his  employers
             Hedone Restaurant. I  note  the  respondent  in  the  decision
             letter challenges the bank statement  evidence  on  the  basis
             that originals were not provided; in order to meet  the  rules
             originals must be provided.


        16.      In addition to this the sponsor's bank statements  show  a
             payment of �250 from his employers on the  15th  August  2014,
             however  the  appellant  failed  to   provide   the   relevant
             corresponding wage slip covering the 15th August 2014 payment.
             When this matter was put to the sponsor, he insisted  that  he
             had provided  all  relevant  wage  slips  to  the  appellant's
             representatives. Unfortunately this wage slip was not provided
             with the application  as  required,  the  appellant  therefore
             fails to meet this requirement of the immigration rules.


        17.      Ms Nagesh however relied on paragraph 245AA of  the  rules
             in relation to this matter  and  argued  that  the  respondent
             should have exercised her discretion by requesting the missing
             wage slip as it formed part of a sequence of documents.  I  do
             not agree. I  find  the  respondent  correctly  exercised  her
             discretion; it is likely the respondent anticipated  that  the
             application would fail for other reasons,  namely  failing  to
             meet the financial threshold and failing to  provide  original
             bank statements, thus a request was not deemed necessary.


        18.      On careful consideration of the evidence before me, I find
             the appellant fails to meet all the requirements  of  Appendix
             FM of the rules, accordingly her appeal must  fail.


        19.       I  am  satisfied  that  there  is  nothing   sufficiently
             compelling or  exceptional  about  this  case  which  requires
             consideration outside the rules following SS (Congo) 2015."

The grounds that were before UTJ Freeman

15. UTJ Freeman limited the grant of permission, as explained below.  Under
    cover  of  a  letter  dated   30   December   2016,   the   appellant's
    representatives, Lawrence Lupin Solicitors, lodged an  application  for
    permission to amend the grounds which, effectively, seek to  renew  the
    application for permission on the grounds that had been refused and, in
    addition, seek a stay of the proceedings to await the judgment  of  the
    Supreme Court in MM (Lebanon) on the relationship  between  the  income
    threshold and Article 8.

16. In these circumstances, it is necessary to summarise the  grounds  that
    were before UTJ Freeman, the terms in which he granted permission,  the
    application for permission to amend the grounds and the application for
    a stay of the proceedings.

17. UTJ Freeman had two sets of grounds, the  grounds  in  support  of  the
    application to the FtT (the "original  grounds")  and  the  grounds  in
    support  of  the  application  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  (the  "renewed
    grounds"). The following is a summary of both:

    i)      The respondent had a discretion under para 245AA of  the  Rules
          and Appendix FM-SE to request  further  documents.  There  was  no
          evidence that the respondent had considered the exercise  of  that
          discretion. The failure to do so made the  decision  unlawful.  In
          any event, it was unreasonable to find  that  the  respondent  had
          exercised the discretion correctly, given the small  shortfall  in
          income and that copies of the bank statements  had  been  provided
          "in  good  faith".  The  respondent  should  have  exercised   the
          discretion and requested the original bank statements (para  9  of
          the original grounds).  The  judge  erred  in  assuming  that  the
          respondent had exercised his discretion. Furthermore, the Tribunal
          itself had a discretion to consider the original  bank  statements
          under rule 14(2) of the Tribunal Procedure  (First-tier  Tribunal)
          (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Rules 2014 (the "FtT Rules").

    ii)     The issue of the "missing wage slip" concerning the payment  in
          August 2014 was raised for the first time at the hearing.  If  the
          respondent had exercised the discretion under para 245AA, it could
          have been clarified that an advance payment  was  made  in  August
          2014 in cash, which the grounds contend was implicit from the wage
          slips which showed that an amount of �250 had been  deducted  from
          the wage slip for 22 August 2014 by way of a staff advance.

            A letter dated 29 June 2016 from  the  sponsor's  employer  was
          attached to the original  grounds  to  explain  that  the  sponsor
          received a cash advance of �250 in August 2014 and that no payslip
          was issued in respect of the cash advance at the time.  Obviously,
          this letter was not before the judge.

            The renewal grounds contend that, given that the "missing  wage
          slip" issue was raised for the first  time  at  the  hearing,  the
          appellant should be able to rely upon the explanation  that  there
          was in fact no missing wage slip and the letter dated 29 June 2016
          from the sponsor's employer.

    iii)    Regarding the income threshold, the judge  erred  in  rejecting
          the basis of calculation suggested by counsel on  the  appellant's
          behalf at the hearing. There was no guidance as to the appropriate
          way to calculate a sponsor's gross annual income. In  the  absence
          of such guidance, it is unreasonable to simply prefer  the  method
          used by the respondent. In addition, given that it was  identified
          at the hearing that there appeared to be a missing wage  slip,  it
          was further unreasonable to rely on  the  respondent's  method  of
          calculation because that this did not take account of the earnings
          in the "missing wage slip".

            In circumstances where the shortfall was small and  there  were
          two different methods of calculation, it was unreasonable  not  to
          take into account the letter from the employer  attesting  to  the
          sponsor's annual income and the sponsor's P60  for  the  tax  year
          2014/2015 which indicated a salary in excess of �18,600.

    iv)     The judge erred in dismissing the appeal under Article 8 on the
          basis that, pursuant to the  Court  of  Appeal's  judgment  in  SS
          (Congo) v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 387, there was nothing sufficiently
          compelling or exceptional about this case. She failed  to  address
          substantively or at all the balancing exercise required by Article
          8 in circumstances where the shortfall was �0.64.

Upper Tribunal Judge Freeman's decision

18. Judge Freeman limited the grant of permission  to  whether,  given  the
    small shortfall in the sponsor's earnings, the respondent ought to have
    considered exercising the discretion under para 245AA of the  Rules  to
    give the applicant  an  opportunity  to  submit  further  evidence.  He
    considered it arguable that "the missing wage  slip"  may  have  formed
    part of a series of documents in which one was  missing,  so  that  the
    person dealing with the application would have had a  discretion  under
    para 245AA(b)(i) to ask for it if they had noticed that it was missing.



19. Judge Freeman refused permission on the remaining grounds.

The application for  permission  to  amend  the  grounds  and  to  stay  the
proceedings

20. The amended grounds begin by referring to the fact that UTJ Freeman had
    granted permission limited to the issue of the "missing wage slip"  and
    stating that the sponsor's employer had confirmed  that  there  was  in
    fact no missing wage slip.

21. The amended grounds then state that the appellant sought  an  extension
    of time to lodge amended grounds "given the  unique  circumstances  and
    the interest in ensuring that all are  aware  of  the  correct  factual
    background to this case".

22. The amended grounds then proceed to advance the  same  grounds,  albeit
    couched in different terms. In addition, in relation to Article  8,  an
    application was made to stay the proceedings  in  order  to  await  the
    judgment of the Supreme Court in MM (Lebanon) as  to  the  relationship
    between the income threshold  and  Article  8  and  to  submit  further
    amended grounds in the light of the Supreme Court's judgment.

Submissions

23. I heard Ms Nagesh briefly at the hearing on the application for a  stay
    of the proceedings. I refused the application. I shall give my  reasons
    below.

24. At the hearing, Ms Nagesh addressed me on the grounds in support of the
    application for permission to amend the grounds. As the amended grounds
    were in effect the grounds upon which permission has been refused,  she
    (in effect) addressed me on the grounds upon which permission had  been
    refused without acknowledging that fact. She made a point, on more than
    one occasion, that it was the appellant's case before  the  judge  that
    the sponsor had provided all of his wage slips (cf the  first  sentence
    of para 17 of the judge's decision).

25. Ms Nagesh submitted that the judge should have placed little weight  on
    the discrepancy between the bank statements and the  wage  slips  since
    the issue of the "missing wage slip" was only raised  at  the  hearing.
    Alternatively, the judge should have allowed the  appellant  to  obtain
    further evidence, although she accepted she had not requested the judge
    for an adjournment. This was because it was disputed that the wage slip
    was missing. The judge was wrong to rely upon a missing wage slip  when
    there was in fact no missing wage slip.

26. Ms Nagesh submitted that  the  judge  had  incorrectly  calculated  the
    sponsor's gross annual income. There were wage slips in the appellant's
    bundle showing that for every period of  fortnight  in  the  period  of
    about six months preceding her application, save for one fortnight, the
    sponsor had earned �715.36 gross for the fortnight. Ms Nagesh submitted
    that it was unfair not to use the daily rate  of  the  sponsor's  gross
    earnings.

27. Various methods of calculation were canvassed at the hearing before me,
    as follows:

    i)      Ms Nagesh suggested the use of a daily rate, i.e. � 715.36 / 14
          days x 365 days = �18,650.46. The judge  rejected  this  basis  of
          calculation.

    ii)     Ms Nagesh  also  suggested  using  the  sponsor's  total  gross
          earnings over 6 � months (�10,729.80) and projecting this  over  a
          12-month period to produce �19,808.86, i.e. �10,729.80 / 6.5 x  12
          = �19,808.86.

    iii)    Mr Jarvis  suggested  the  respondent's  method  which  was  as
          follows: �715.36 for one fortnight x 26 fortnights for the year  =
          �18,599.36. This led to a short shortfall.

28. Mr Jarvis  submitted  that  the  respondent's  method  was  the  method
    provided for at para 13(a) of Appendix FM-SE. Para 13(a) of Appendix FM-
    SE, as at January 2015, provided as follows:

      "Calculating Gross Annual Income under Appendix FM

       13.     Based  on  evidence  that  meets  the  requirements  of  this
        Appendix, and can be taken  into  account  with  reference  to  the
        applicable provisions of Appendix FM,  gross  annual  income  under
        paragraphs E-ECP.3.1., E-LTRP.3.1., E-ECC.2.1. and E-LTRC.2.1. will
        be calculated in the following ways:


      (a)   Where the person is in salaried employment in  the  UK  at  the
                 date of application, has been  employed  by  their  current
                 employer for at least 6 months and has been paid throughout
                 the period of 6 months prior to the date of application  at
                 a level of gross annual salary which equals or exceeds  the
                 level relied upon in paragraph 13(a)(i), their gross annual
                 income will be (where paragraph 13(b) does not  apply)  the
                 total of:
            (i) The  level  of  gross  annual  salary  relied  upon  in  the
                     application;
            (ii) The gross amount of  any  specified  non-employment  income
                     (other than pension income) received by them or  their
                     partner  in  the  12  months  prior  to  the  date  of
                     application; and
            (iii) The gross annual income from a UK or foreign State pension
                     or  a  private  pension  received  by  them  or  their
                     partner.


      (b)   Where the person is in salaried employment in the UK at the date
                 of application and  has  been  employed  by  their  current
                 employer for less than 6 months (or at least 6  months  but
                 the person does not rely on paragraph 13(a)), ........"


      (My underlining)

29. Mr Jarvis also referred  me  to  para  51.1-5.1.4  of  the  Immigration
    Directorate Instructions ("IDIs") dated November 2014 entitled: "Family
    Members under Appendix FM and Appendix Armed Forces of the  Immigration
    Rules",  "Annex  FM  Section  FM  1.7:  Financial  Requirement",  which
    provide:


        "5. Salaried and non-salaried employment


        5.1. Category A: With current employer  for  6  months  or  more  -
        person residing in the UK


        5.1.1.   Where the applicant's partner  (and/or  the  applicant  if
             they are in the UK with permission to  work)  is  in  salaried
             employment at the date of application and has  been  with  the
             same employer for at least 6  months  prior  to  the  date  of
             application, they can count their gross annual salary  towards
             the financial requirement. In doing so  they  must  have  been
             paid throughout the period of 6 months prior to  the  date  of
             application at a level of gross annual salary which equals  or
             exceeds the level relied upon in the application.


        5.1.2.   Gross income from non-salaried employment will be  counted
             on the same basis as income from salaried employment where the
             person has been with the same employer for 6 months or more at
             the date of application.


        5.1.3.   Non-salaried employment includes that paid at an hourly or
             other rate (and the number and/or pattern of hours required to
             be worked may vary) or paid an amount which  varies  according
             to the work undertaken. Salaried employment includes that paid
             at a minimum fixed rate  (usually  annual)  which  is  usually
             subject to a contractual minimum number of hours to be worked.




        5.1.4.   The only difference in Category A between salaried and non-
             salaried employment is how gross annual salary  or  employment
             income is calculated:


           Where the person is in salaried employment - they must have been
             paid throughout the period of 6 months prior to  the  date  of
             application at a level of gross annual salary which equals  or
             exceeds the level relied upon in  the  application.  Therefore
             the figure used towards the requirement  will  be  the  lowest
             level of annual salary received during the 6 month period.


           Where the person is in non-salaried employment -  the  level  of
             gross annual employment income relied upon in the  application
             will be the annual equivalent of the  person's  average  gross
             monthly income from non-salaried employment in  the  6  months
             prior to the date of application (where  that  employment  was
             held throughout that period).


           To calculate this annualised average for non-salaried employment
             in Category A the following calculation should be used:


           (Total gross income from employment held throughout the 6  month
             period, divided by 6) multiplied by  12  =  Income  from  non-
             salaried employment that can be counted towards the  financial
             requirement."

30. Ms Nagesh submitted that the judge was wrong to find that the appellant
    did not satisfy the requirements of the Rules because originals of  the
    sponsor's bank statements had not been provided. The  respondent  ought
    to have requested the  originals  of  the  bank  statements  and  acted
    unlawfully in failing to consider whether to exercise his discretion to
    request the original bank statements. This was because the only  defect
    in the appellant's application was the fact that originals of the  bank
    statements had not been provided. Ms Nagesh submitted that there was no
    reason to suppose that the sponsor would have been  unable  to  produce
    the original bank statements, if they had been requested.

31. Mr Jarvis submitted that para 245AA of the Rules did not apply  in  the
    instant case. The relevant provision was in para D  of  Appendix  FM-SE
    which, as at January 2015, provided as follows (my underlining):


        "D.      (a) In deciding an application in relation to  which  this
             Appendix states that specified documents must be provided,  the
             Entry Clearance Officer or Secretary of State  ("the  decision-
             maker") will consider documents that have been  submitted  with
             the application, and will  only  consider  documents  submitted
             after the application where sub-paragraph (b) or (e) applies.


      (b)   If the applicant:
                    (i) Has submitted:
                       (aa)   A  sequence  of  documents  and  some  of  the
                                  documents  in  the  sequence   have   been
                                  omitted (e.g. if one bank statement from a
                                  series is missing);
      (bb)  A document in the wrong format (for example, if a letter is  not
                                  on letterhead paper as specified); or
      (cc)  A document that is a copy and not an original document; or
      (dd)   A  document  which  does  not  contain  all  of  the  specified
                                  information; or
                 (ii) Has not submitted a specified document,
                  the  decision-maker  may  contact  the  applicant  or  his
                 representative in writing or  otherwise,  and  request  the
                 document(s)  or  the  correct  version(s).   The   material
                 requested must be received at the address specified in  the
                 request within a  reasonable  timescale  specified  in  the
                 request.


      (c)   The decision-maker will not request documents where  he  or  she
                 does not anticipate that addressing the error  or  omission
                 referred to in sub-paragraph  (b)  will  lead  to  a  grant
                 because the application will be refused for other reasons.

      (d)   If the applicant has submitted:
                       (i) A document in the wrong format; or
                  (ii) A document  that  is  a  copy  and  not  an  original
                       document, or
            (iii) A document that does not  contain  all  of  the  specified
                       information,   but   the   missing   information   is
                       verifiable from:
                 (1) other documents submitted with the application,
            (2) the website of the organisation which issued  the  document,
                            or
            (3) the website of the appropriate regulatory body,


                  the application may be  granted  exceptionally,  providing
                 the decision-maker is satisfied  that  the  document(s)  is
                 genuine and that the applicant  meets  the  requirement  to
                 which the document relates. The decision-maker reserves the
                 right to request the specified original document(s) in  the
                 correct  format  in  all  cases  where  sub-paragraph   (b)
                 applies, and to refuse applications if this material is not
                 provided as set out in sub-paragraph (b).


       (e)  Where the decision-maker is satisfied  that  there  is  a  valid
                 reason why a specified document(s) cannot be supplied, e.g.
                 because it is not issued in a  particular  country  or  has
                 been permanently lost, he or she  may  exercise  discretion
                 not to apply the requirement  for  the  document(s)  or  to
                 request   alternative   or   additional   information    or
                 document(s) be submitted by the applicant.


      (f)   Before making a decision under Appendix FM or this Appendix, the
                 decision-maker  may  contact   the   applicant   or   their
                 representative in writing or otherwise to  request  further
                 information or documents. The material  requested  must  be
                 received at the address specified in the request  within  a
                 reasonable timescale specified in the request."


      (My underlining)

32. I reserved my decision on the application for permission to  amend  the
    grounds and any issue as to whether the judge had materially  erred  in
    law.

Assessment

33. I shall first give my reasons for  refusing  the  application  for  the
    proceedings to be stayed in order to await the judgment of the  Supreme
    Court in MM (Lebanon).

34. The issue the appellant seeks to rely upon in her application for  stay
    was not raised at the hearing before the judge. In any event, the issue
    before me is whether the judge had materially erred in law.  The  judge
    was bound by the judgment of the Court of Appeal in R (MM (Lebanon) and
    others) v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 985, as is the Upper  Tribunal.  I  took
    into account the overriding interest. In all of  the  circumstances,  I
    refused to exercise my discretion to stay the proceedings in the  Upper
    Tribunal.

35. Before I turn to the  remaining  issues,  I  will  make  the  following
    observations:

    i)      As can be seen from what I have said above, UTJ Freeman granted
        permission  on  a  limited  ground,  concerning  the  exercise   of
        discretion under para 245AA of the  Rules  and  the  issue  of  the
        "missing wage slip". Although it was the sponsor's evidence at  the
        hearing that he had given all of the wage slips to the  appellant's
        representatives, this does not mean that  it  was  the  appellant's
        case that there were  no  missing  wage  slips.  Whilst  Ms  Nagesh
        informed me that she did  not  apply  for  an  adjournment  at  the
        hearing before the judge because it was the appellant's  case  that
        there were no missing wage slips, it can be seen from  para  17  of
        the judge's decision that, to the contrary, Ms Nagesh  relied  upon
        para 245AA in relation to the  missing  wage  slips.  She  did  not
        submit to the judge that there were no missing wage slips.

    ii)     The fact that it was subsequently confirmed by the appellant or
        the sponsor with the sponsor's employer that there was in  fact  no
        missing wage slip and the fact that the missing wage slip issue was
        raised for  first time at the hearing before the  judge  were  then
        used as the springboard from which or  gateway  through  which  the
        appellant and those representing her have lodged an application  to
        renew  the  grounds  upon  which  permission  was  refused  and  an
        application for a  stay  of  the  proceedings,  dressed  up  as  an
        application to amend the grounds.

    iii)    The  failure  to  be  candid  in  making  the  application  and
        addressing the Upper Tribunal at the  hearing  does  no  credit  to
        those who have represented the appellant. Likewise the  attempt  to
        dress up what was in reality a renewed application  for  permission
        as an application  to  amend  the  grounds  "in  order  to  clarify
        matters" or in "the interest in ensuring that all are aware of  the
        correct factual background to this case".

36. Before I turn to the remaining issues, it should be remembered that, in
    relation to each issue  discussed  at  paras  37  to  58  below,  I  am
    considering whether the judge arguably material erred in law  in  order
    to decide whether to grant permission to amend the grounds.

The income threshold

37. I begin with the judge's finding that the appellant did not satisfy the
    income threshold because she had not  established  that  the  sponsor's
    gross annual income was �18,600.

38. Much reliance was placed in the grounds and amended grounds that  there
    was no guidance for calculating the gross annual income. This is simply
    wrong, because Mr Jarvis produced the guidance at  the  hearing  before
    me. Before I turn to the guidance, there  are  some  general  points  I
    should make which will no doubt seem obvious but which will explain the
    reason why the bases of calculation  used  by  the  appellant  and  her
    representatives produced results that are above  the  income  threshold
    whereas the respondent's basis of calculation does not.

39. As there are 52 weeks in a year, the number of weeks  in  a  month  are
    4.33333 (recurring). This must be properly factored into any attempt to
    calculate  the  sponsor's  gross  monthly  earnings  from   the   gross
    fortnightly earnings shown in his fortnightly wage slips.  Ms  Nagesh's
    second method of calculation does not.

40.  Ms Nagesh advanced two different bases of calculation as follows:

      i)    The use of a daily rate, i.e. � 715.36 / 14 days x 365  days  =
          �18,650.46.

    ii)     Taking the sponsor's total  gross  earnings  over  6  �  months
          (�10,729.80) and projecting this  over  a  12-month  period,  i.e.
          �10,729.80 / 6.5 = � 1,650.7384 x 12 = �19,808.86.

41. I have no hesitation in rejecting the first basis - i.e. the daily rate
    basis - for  the simple reason that it assumes that the sponsor  worked
    or works every single day of the 365 days in the  year,  whereas  there
    was no evidence before the judge that he worked every single day of the
    period of 14 days in the fortnights to which his  wage  slips  related.
    This is precisely the reason why the  judge  rejected  the  daily  rate
    basis suggested by Ms Nagesh.

42. There are three problems with the second method, the first works to the
    appellant's advantage, the second and third are each fatal to her case,
    as follows:

    i)      The wage  slips  show  that  the  sponsor's  earnings  for  the
        entirety of the period of 30 weeks covered by the  wage  slips  was
        not �10,729.80 but �10,730.40, i.e. slightly higher than the figure
        used by Ms Nagesh.

    ii)     The divisor that Ms Nagesh used - i.e. 6.5  for  6.5  months  -
        takes no account of the fact that there are in fact 28.166667  (the
        '6' is recurring) weeks in a period  of  6.5  months,  whereas  the
        figure she used (she used �10,729.80 but this should be  �10.730.40
        as shown by the wage slip for week 30)  represented  the  sponsor's
        earnings for 30 weeks. By dividing the sponsor's  earnings  by  6.5
        for 6.5 months, the  true  number  of  weeks  in  a  month  (4.3333
        recurring) is not taken into  account.  This  distorts  the  result
        obtained so that the small shortfall is plugged and it  produces  a
        small surplus instead. The gross monthly earnings  that  Ms  Nagesh
        obtains  using  her  second  method  (�  1,650.7384)  is  therefore
        artificially higher than it should be.

            The correct divisor is 30 (instead of 6.5) because the earnings
        of �10,730.40 were for 30 weeks. The correct  calculation  for  the
        gross monthly earnings is therefore as follows:   �10,730.40  /  30
        (for 30 weeks) x 4.33333 (because  there  are  4.3333  weeks  in  a
        month) = � 1,549.93. Projecting this over 12 months produces  gross
        annual earnings of �18,599.22, which  makes  the  shortfall  �0.78,
        slightly more than the shortfall of �0.64  obtained  by  using  the
        respondent's method of  calculation.  The  difference  between  the
        �0.78 shortfall and the �0.64 shortfall is due to the fact that  52
        weeks is not fully divisible by 12 months.

            Accordingly, the fairest way  to  calculate  the  gross  yearly
        income is to work in terms of the number of weeks in  a  year  from
        the gross  fortnightly  earnings.  That  is  essentially  what  the
        respondent did.

    iii)    It is not the case that there was no guidance  for  calculating
        the sponsor's gross income. There was such  guidance.  I  have  set
        this out at my paras 28 and 29 above.

            Para 5.1.4 of the IDIs makes it  clear  that:  (a)   where  the
        person is in salaried  employment,  the  figure  used  towards  the
        requirement will be the lowest  level  of  annual  salary  received
        during the 6 month period; (b)  the  method  of  using  a  person's
        average  gross  monthly  income  to  obtain  the   level   of   the
        individual's gross annual gross only applies to this who are in non-
        salaried employment.

            Thus, on the basis of para 5.1.4 of the IDIs, the  figure  that
        should have been used by the respondent is �357.68 (wage  slip  for
        week 18) which is the lowest level he  earned  in  a  period  of  a
        fortnight. Thus, having regard to  para  5.1.4  of  the  IDIs,  the
        respondent was generous in using the higher figure of  �715.36.  If
        the correct figure had been used, the calculation would  then  have
        been as follows: �357.68 / 2 (for 2 weeks) x 52 (for  52  weeks)  =
        �9,299.68, which falls short of the income threshold of �18,600  by
        �9,300.32, i.e. short by a long way. This is  the  figure  that  is
        arrived at by applying the IDIs.

    iv)     Even assuming that para 5.1.4. of the IDIs is objectionable  on
        the ground that it falls foul of the principle in R (Alvi)  v  SSHD
        [2012] UKSC 33, para 13(a) of Appendix FM-SE makes it  clear  that,
        where a person is in salaried  employment,  has  been  employed  by
        their current employer for six months and has been paid  throughout
        the period of 6 months prior to the date of application "at a level
        of gross salary which equals or exceeds the legal  relied  upon  in
        paragraph 13(a)(i)", their gross annual income will be the total of
        the level of gross annual salary relied upon in the appellant.

            If para 5.1.4 of the IDIs is not applied, the best method  that
        the appellant can hope for which produces the best result  for  her
        whilst taking proper account of the fact that the sponsor was  paid
        on a fortnightly basis and that it was necessary for the  six-month
        period of earnings to be calculated backwards from the date of  the
        appellant's application, is as follows:


                 Step 1 is to calculate the  gross  earnings  for  the  six
             months prior to the date of application
                 = Gross earnings as at the end  of  week  30  (�10,730.40)
             less the earnings for the first 4 weeks (i.e. less �715.36 x 2)


                 = �10,730.40 - �1,430.72
                       = � 9,299.68
                       This is therefore the gross earnings for 26 weeks.


                 Step 2 is to projecting the gross earnings  for  26  weeks
             over 52 weeks, by applying a multiplier of 2 as follows:
                       The gross annual earnings were therefore �9,299.68 x
        2 = �18,599.36.
                       This gives a shortfall of �0.64.


            This produces the same result as that  achieved  by  using  the
        respondent's method of calculation.

43. To be clear, I reject Ms  Nagesh's  suggested  methods  of  calculation
    because: (i) the first method assumes (in the absence of any  evidence)
    that the sponsor worked every single day of the 30 weeks to  which  his
    wage slips relate and every single day of the 365-days in the year; and
    (ii) the second method does not take into account the  true  number  of
    weeks in a month.

44. The grounds that were before UTJ Freeman argued (as  summarised  at  my
    para 17 iii) above)  that it was unreasonable for  the  judge  to  rely
    upon the respondent's method of calculation because  it  did  not  take
    into account the earnings in the missing wage slip.  This  argument  is
    simply not tenable, since it is stated at the same time that there  was
    in fact no missing wage slip. Thus, the judge did not arguably  err  by
    failing to take into account earnings of �250 to  correspond  with  the
    payment made in August 2014 because it is now known that there  was  no
    missing wage slip and that the earnings reflected by the  payment  made
    in August 2014 were already reflected in the wage slip for week 20.

45. Likewise, the arguments to the effect that there was unfairness in  the
    judge permitting the respondent to raise the missing wage slip issue is
    bereft of any substance. This issue has been used by the appellant  and
    those representing her as the means by way to re-argue the grounds upon
    which permission was refused.

46. Furthermore, it hardly behoves the appellant to complain that the judge
    should have adjourned the hearing and allow  the  appellant  to  obtain
    further evidence when no application was made by Ms Nagesh  as  Counsel
    on the appellant's behalf to request an adjournment. As the  judge  was
    not to know whether any such further evidence would be forthcoming, she
    was right not to adjourn of her volition.

47. I have considered whether  the  fact  that  the  judge  relied  upon  a
    discrepancy arising from what was thought to be a missing wage slip was
    arguably material to  the  outcome.  The  correct  calculation  of  the
    sponsor's gross earnings for the year does not arguably turn  upon  the
    payment of �250.00 in August 2014. The judge's finding that the minimum
    income threshold was not reached was not  in  any  way  linked  to  the
    August 2014 payment of �250. The judge's view that there was a  missing
    wage slip was only relevant to her finding that the appellant  had  not
    satisfied the requirements of Appendix FM-SE because not only  had  she
    not provided the originals of the bank statements, she had not provided
    this "missing wage slip".

48. I have therefore concluded that the judge did not arguably err  in  law
    in reaching her conclusion that  the  appellant  did  not  satisfy  the
    income threshold because she had not  established  that  the  sponsor's
    gross annual income was �18,600.

The discretion to request documents

49. I turn next to the issue of whether the judge arguably erred in law  in
    finding that the respondent had correctly exercised his  discretion  by
    failing to request the missing wage slip, an argument that was  in  the
    grounds that were before UTJ Freeman. This  argument  has  no  purchase
    since it is now known that there was no missing wage slip.

50. Next, I turn to the argument  in  the  grounds  that  were  before  UTJ
    Freeman that the respondent should have exercised the discretion  under
    para 245AA of the Rules and request original bank statements  from  the
    appellant.

51. In this regard, Mr Jarvis pointed out that the discretion  in  relation
    to the financial requirement is at para D of Appendix  FM-SE,  and  not
    para 245AA of the Rules.

52. The first point is that the mere  fact  that  the  respondent  has  not
    stated that the exercise of the discretion had been considered does not
    mean that it had not been considered.

53. Secondly, although para D (b) makes provision for the decision-maker to
    request a document that is a copy and not  an  original  and  makes  it
    clear that a decision-maker has a discretion to request  the  original,
    para D (c) of Appendix FM-SE states that the  decision-maker  will  not
    request documents where he or she does not anticipate  that  addressing
    the error or omission will  lead to the application  being  granted.  I
    have said above  that  the  judge  did  not  arguably  err  in  law  in
    concluding that the appellant did not  satisfy  the  income  threshold.
    Thus, even if (which I do  not  accept)  the  respondent  did  fail  to
    consider whether to exercise the discretion to ask  for  original  bank
    statements,  this  is  not  arguably  material  to  the  outcome.   The
    appellant's application could not succeed under the Rules  because  she
    did not meet the income threshold. The judge therefore did not arguably
    err in  rejecting  the  submission  that  the  respondent  should  have
    exercised the discretion and request the original bank statements.

54. The grounds that were before UTJ Freeman argued  that  the  FtT  had  a
    discretion to consider the original bank statements under rule 14(2) of
    the FtT Rules. Not only does this ignore the fact  that  the  appellant
    did not produce the original bank statements to the judge or, for  that
    matter, to me, Ms Nagesh preferring to rely upon  the  submission  that
    there was no reason to suppose that the sponsor would not  be  able  to
    produce the bank statements, the submission  simply  ignores  the  fact
    that only documents produced with the application could  be  considered
    by the decision-maker. Thus, only documents that were produced with the
    application are relevant to the substance of the decision  (s.85(4)  of
    the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002).

55. Accordingly, for all of the reasons given above, I have concluded  that
    the judge therefore did not arguably err in  rejecting  the  submission
    that the respondent should have exercised the discretion and  requested
    the original bank statements.

55.   The Article 8 grounds are unarguable. The  relevant  authority  is  SS
    (Congo), at paras 25-41. After considering the relevant principles  and
    submissions before it, the Court of Appeal concluded (at para 41) that,
    in entry clearance cases:

            "..., the appropriate general formulation for this  category  is
             that such cases will arise where an applicant for LTE can  show
             that compelling circumstances exist (which are not sufficiently
             recognised under the new Rules) to require the  grant  of  such
             leave."

56. I have considered the witness  statements  of  the  appellant  and  the
    sponsor. There was no evidence that  came  anywhere  close  to  showing
    compelling circumstances.  The sponsor is a  British  citizen.  He  was
    recognised a refugee in the United Kingdom. His passport  indicates  he
    was born in Sudan. The appellant and the sponsor met in Sudan when  the
    sponsor travelled to Sudan in January 2012. They were marred  in  Sudan
    in February 2013 and lived together there for  just  over  2  �  months
    before the sponsor returned to the United Kingdom. The sponsor  visited
    the appellant from 25 December 2015 until 11 January 2016.  Whilst they
    said that they missed each other, there was simply no explanation  why,
    in view of the fact that the sponsor, as a former refugee, had returned
    to visit and stay in Sudan on two occasions one of which was  for  just
    over 2 � months, they would not be able to enjoy family  life  together
    in Sudan. There was no evidence of compelling circumstances.

57. Accordingly, I have concluded that it  is  unarguable  that  the  judge
    erred in law in dismissing the Article 8 claim on the basis that  there
    was nothing sufficiently compelling  or  exceptional  about  this  case
    which required consideration outside the Rules pursuant to SS (Congo).

58. I therefore refuse the application for permission to amend the  grounds
    which was, in reality, an application to  re-new  the  application  for
    permission on the grounds that had been refused by UTJ Freeman.

59. I turn to the limited ground upon which UTJ Freeman granted permission,
    i.e. whether, given the small shortfall in the sponsor's earnings,  the
    respondent ought to have considered  exercising  the  discretion  under
    para 245AA of the Rules to give the applicant an opportunity to  submit
    further evidence on the basis that it was arguable  that  "the  missing
    wage slip" may have formed part of a series of documents in  which  one
    was missing, so that the person dealing with the application would have
    had a discretion under para 245AA(b)(i) to  ask  for  it  if  they  had
    noticed that it was missing.

60. Leaving aside the fact that the discretion to request documents was  in
    para D of the Appendix FM-SE and not para 245AA of the Rules, it is now
    known that there was in fact no missing  wage  slip.  The  ground  upon
    which permission was granted has therefore become moot.

61. The appellant's appeal to the Upper Tribunal  is  therefore  dismissed.
    There is no error of law in the decision of the judge.

62. The fact that it has taken two short paragraphs (paras 60-61)  to  deal
    with the limited ground upon which permission was granted and much more
    to deal with the application for permission to amend the grounds says a
    lot about the way in which this case has been handled.

      Decision

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law.      The  appellant's  appeal
    to the Upper Tribunal is therefore dismissed.
