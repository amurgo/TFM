                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS



    Introduction


    1.     The Appellant appealed with  permission  granted  by  First-tier
         Tribunal  Judge  VA  Osborne  on  27  November  2014  against   the
         determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge Boyd who  had  dismissed
         the Appellant's appeal against removal on human rights  (Article  8
         ECHR family life) grounds  in  a  determination  promulgated  on  9
         October 2014.


    2.     The Appellant is a national of Pakistan,  born  on  27  December
         1985.  It is not necessary to repeat his immigration history or the
         history of the preceding litigation in any detail which is set  out
         at [16] of Judge Boyd's determination.  In essence it was  held  in
         the Upper Tribunal that a previous First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  had
         failed to deal with the Article 8 ECHR claim  which  the  Appellant
         had raised in the context of his Tier 4 (General)  Student  Migrant
         appeal.  The appeal was remitted to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for
         that purpose.  The Appellant relied on his  family  life  with  his
         British wife and British child.  Judge Boyd found that Appendix  FM
         was not met, in terms of the requirement for entry clearance and in
         terms of the financial requirements.  Nor was EX.1  met.    It  was
         proportionate for the Appellant to return to Pakistan to seek entry
         clearance.


    3.     Permission to appeal was granted because it was considered  that
         it was arguable that the judge had erred in his assessment  of  the
         financial requirements of Appendix FM.  The Appellant's  son  as  a
         British Citizen was  excluded  from  the  calculation  and  so  the
         correct figure was �18,600, not �22,400.


    4.     Standard directions were made by the tribunal,  indicating  that
         the appeal would be reheard immediately if a material error of  law
         were found.  A rule 24 notice dated 10 December 2014  opposing  the
         appeal had been filed on the Respondent's behalf.


    Submissions - error of law


    5.     Miss Heidar for the Appellant relied on the grounds  of  onwards
         of appeal and the grant of permission to  appeal.   The  judge  had
         miscalculated the income requirement by including the British child
         in the calculation. The judge had not given sufficient attention to
         the components of section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration  and
         Asylum Act 2002.  The Appellant held a degree  and  spoke  English.
         The public interest did not require the Appellant's removal in view
         of his genuine and subsisting relationship with a child whom it was
         not reasonable to expect to leave the United Kingdom.


    6.     Mr Tarlow for the Respondent relied on the rule 24  notice.   He
         accepted that the  judge  had  erred  in  his  calculation  of  the
         financial requirements but that error was not material as it was an
         Article 8 ECHR claim, not  an  Appendix  FM  application.   In  any
         event, other parts of Appendix FM had not been satisfied, e.g., the
         specified documents.  Nor was section 117B(6) was satisfied as  the
         child did not have to leave the United Kingdom with the  Appellant.
         Alternative arrangements were possible, as the judge had found when
         considering EX.1.   The  judge  had  reached  a  properly  reasoned
         decision and there was no basis for interfering with it.


    7.     Miss Heidar  addressed  the  tribunal  briefly  in  reply.   The
         judge's approach was mistaken.  This was a situation where Appendix
         FM's conditions were inapplicable because it was an Article 8  ECHR
         claim.


    8.     The tribunal indicated at the conclusion of submissions that  it
         found no material error of law and reserved its determination which
         now follows.


    No material error of law finding


    9.     It was accepted by the Secretary of State  that  the  judge  had
         inadvertently  erred  in   his   calculation   of   the   financial
         requirements of Appendix FM.  That error was  immaterial,  as  this
         was an Article 8 ECHR claim, not an application under Appendix  FM.
          The relevance of Appendix FM to the Article  8  ECHR  family  life
         claim was whether it was possible for the Appellant to comply  with
         those provisions and, if so, whether it was reasonable for  him  to
         be expected to do so in all the circumstances.  The  judge's  error
         was in  the  Appellant's  favour,  in  that  the  judge  approached
         Appendix FM more stringently than was necessary.  By implication he
         found that it would be possible  for  the  Appellant  to  meet  the
         requirements in principle.


    10.    The judge's treatment of the evidence was more  than  sufficient
         and he set out his essential findings with clarity in a careful and
         well structured determination.  The judge applied section  117B  of
         the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and  plainly  paid
         close attention to it.  The judge was entitled  to  find  that  the
         Appellant's  marriage  had  been  arranged  when  the   Appellant's
         immigration  status  was  precarious  in  the  sense  that  he  had
         temporary leave only to be in the United Kingdom, which  leave  was
         on the point of expiry.  The judge was similarly entitled  to  find
         that British Citizen child who was very young and  adaptable  could
         live with his mother while his father obtained entry clearance from
         Pakistan or alternatively could leave the United Kingdom  and  live
         with his parents in Pakistan.  The decision as to whether the child
         should travel to Pakistan with his  parents  pending  his  father's
         obtaining entry clearance to  return  to  the  United  Kingdom  was
         obviously one for the Appellant and his wife to reach.   There were
         a number of possibilities open to them which in no way  could  harm
         the child.


    11.    The judge was entitled to find on the evidence before  him  that
         there   were   no   compelling,   compassionate   or    exceptional
         circumstances which might have required the Secretary of  State  to
         consider the exercise of discretion outside the  Immigration  Rules
         in the Appellant's favour.  On the contrary, the parties were  well
         aware  of  the  situation  when  the   marriage   was   contracted.
         Nevertheless the judge conducted a Razgar [2004] UKHL 27  analysis,
         giving proper reasons for finding that the Appellant's removal  was
         proportionate to the legitimate objective of  immigration  control.
         His conclusions were manifestly open to him.


    12.    The tribunal accordingly finds that there was no material  error
         of law in the determination and there is no basis  for  interfering
         with the judge's decision.
