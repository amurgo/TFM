                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction and Background

 1. The Appellant appeals against a determination of Judge  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Horvath (the judge) promulgated on 7th February 2014.

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of the United States  of  America  born  2nd
    June 1961 who applied for entry clearance to enable him  to  settle  in
    the United Kingdom with his spouse Helen Mark to whom I shall refer  as
    the Sponsor.

 3. The application was made on or about 11th March  2013.   The  Appellant
    explained in the  application  form  that  his  relationship  with  the
    Sponsor first began on 5th November 2012, and they first met in  person
    in the United Kingdom on 9th January 2013.  They lived together in  the
    United Kingdom from 9th January 2013, before travelling to  the  United
    States on 18th February 2013.  They married on 7th March 2013 and  were
    living together in the United States when  the  application  for  entry
    clearance was made.

 4. The Appellant explained that the Sponsor has two children, both British
    citizens, born 21st March 2001 and 7th April 2004 respectively.

 5. In relation to finance it  was  explained  that  the  Sponsor  received
    disability living allowance of �72.40 per week,  child  tax  credit  of
    �111.52 per week, incapacity benefit of �226.70 every  two  weeks,  and
    child benefit of �134.80  every  four  weeks.   The  Sponsor  lived  in
    private rented  accommodation  in  the  United  Kingdom,  and  received
    council tax benefit which paid the �900 per annum council tax in  full,
    and received housing benefit of �415.40 per calendar month whereas  the
    rent was �470 per month.

 6. The Appellant confirmed that he had employment  in  the  United  States
    which was internet based.

 7. The application was refused on 17th June 2013.  The Respondent referred
    to section E-ECP2.6, 2.7 and 2.10 of Appendix FM not accepting that the
    relationship  between  the  Appellant  and  Sponsor  was  genuine   and
    subsisting, nor that they had contracted a  valid  marriage,  nor  that
    they intended to live together permanently in the United Kingdom.

 8. In giving reasons the Respondent  noted  that  other  than  a  marriage
    certificate and a small number of photographs, the  Appellant  had  not
    submitted any supporting evidence to confirm the relationship.

 9. In relation to financial requirements, it was noted  that  the  Sponsor
    claimed to be exempt from meeting the financial requirements set out in
    section E-ECP3.1 because  she  received  Disability  Living  Allowance.
    Although the Sponsor's bank statements  had  been  submitted  to  prove
    this, there was no letter from the  Department  of  Work  and  Pensions
    (DWP) to confirm that the Sponsor was entitled to and was receiving DLA
    and this was a requirement of the Rules.

10. In addition there was in any event, even if the Sponsor was exempt from
    the financial requirements in E-ECP3.1, a requirement that the  parties
    must be able to maintain and accommodate themselves and any  dependants
    adequately in the United Kingdom without recourse to public funds.  The
    Sponsor's bank account on 23rd July 2012 was  �44.73  overdrawn,  which
    suggested that  the  Appellant  could  not  be  adequately  financially
    supported, particularly  as  the  Sponsor  also  had  two  children  to
    support.

11. In relation to accommodation the Appellant had  stated  that  he  would
    live  with  the  Sponsor  and  her   children   in   privately   rented
    accommodation but no tenancy agreement or other documentation had  been
    submitted to confirm the ownership of  the  property  or  that  he  had
    permission to move in.  The Respondent was therefore not satisfied that
    the Appellant would be  adequately  accommodated  without  recourse  to
    public funds as required by E-ECP3.4.

12. The Respondent considered whether the application raised  or  contained
    any exceptional circumstances consistent with the right to respect  for
    family life contained in Article 8 of the 1950 European  Convention  on
    Human Rights, which might warrant consideration of  a  grant  of  entry
    clearance outside the  requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   The
    Respondent decided that  no  exceptional  circumstances  existed  which
    would merit such consideration.

13. The Appellant appealed.  In summary he explained that the guidance  for
    entry clearance for spouses indicated that he only  had  to  provide  a
    marriage certificate and proof that the parties  to  the  marriage  had
    met.  This evidence was  supplied  and  the  Appellant  stated  he  was
    enclosing with the appeal form letters written to the Sponsor at  their
    joint address in the United States, insurance documents  showing  joint
    insurance, school records listing the Appellant as  the  stepfather  of
    the Sponsor's children, and an affidavit from  a  neighbour  confirming
    their cohabitation.

14. A letter from the DWP confirming the Sponsor to be in  receipt  of  DLA
    was said to be submitted with the appeal, and  it  was  contended  that
    because the Sponsor was  exempt  from  the  financial  requirements  of
    Appendix FM, there was no requirement that she must  still  prove  that
    she can adequately maintain the Appellant.

15. The Appellant requested that the Respondent consider his  finances  and
    pointed out that they had been keeping two residences over six  months,
    one in the United Kingdom and one in the United States.  The  Appellant
    worked for an American company which paid him approximately $30,000 per
    year, as evidenced by his tax returns.  His employment involves working
    through the internet, and would still be available to him if  he  lived
    in the United Kingdom.  He was able to undertake his employment when he
    was in the United Kingdom in January  2013.   The  Appellant  contended
    that he had savings of approximately �20,000 available.

16. The Appellant confirmed that he had lived at the Sponsor's  address  in
    the United Kingdom for six weeks in January  and  February  2013.   The
    Appellant requested that his appeal be determined  on  the  papers  and
    submitted to the Tribunal an undated letter to  be  considered  by  the
    judge determining the appeal, together with the documents  referred  to
    in the letter, numbered 1-17.

17. The appeal was determined on the papers, as requested by the Appellant,
    by the judge on 24th January 2014.  The judge found that he could  only
    take into account documents submitted with the  application  for  entry
    clearance and that  the  Respondent  had  not  had  an  opportunity  to
    consider the  documents  submitted  by  the  Appellant  direct  to  the
    Tribunal.  The judge therefore decided that  he  could  not  take  into
    account any documents  submitted  post-application,  and  he  therefore
    declined to consider the  Appellant's  documents  numbered  1-17.   The
    judge referred to these documents in paragraph 5 of  the  determination
    as being a bundle of papers in a blue file, and in paragraph 6 as being
    the Appellant's appeal bundle without an index  or  pagination  and  in
    loose form contained in a blue  folder.   The  documents  are  in  fact
    paginated 1-17, and the  index  is  contained  within  the  Appellant's
    undated letter.

18. The judge found insufficient evidence had been submitted to prove  that
    the Appellant and Sponsor had a genuine  and  subsisting  marriage  and
    intended to live permanently together in the United Kingdom.

19. In relation to the financial requirements the judge did not accept that
    it had been proved that the Sponsor was exempt from the requirements in
    E-ECP3.1 but  even  if  she  was,  it  had  not  been  proved  adequate
    maintenance was available.  In addition there was no tenancy  agreement
    for the accommodation, and as  the  Sponsor  was  entirely  reliant  on
    public funds, it could not be  said  that  adequate  accommodation  was
    available.

20. The judge found that in relation to the Appellant's  finances,  he  had
    not submitted satisfactory documentary evidence of his income or of his
    savings, with this application.

21. In relation to Article 8 of the 1950 European Convention, which relates
    to family life, the judge made no findings on this,  as  the  Appellant
    had raised no Article 8 issues.

22. The Appellant applied for permission to appeal  contending  in  summary
    that the Respondent did have knowledge of the evidence submitted by the
    Appellant to the Tribunal as a list of the evidence was attached to the
    appeal form though the documents could not be attached  to  the  appeal
    form which was lodged on line.  The Appellant contended that if it  was
    felt that the Respondent needed further time to consider the documents,
    the appeal could have been adjourned.

23. The Appellant pointed out the directions he received from the  Tribunal
    indicated that he only had to send evidence to the  Tribunal  which  he
    had done.  The Appellant pointed out that his evidence was indexed  and
    had a listing number on each piece of paper.  The  Appellant  contended
    that the judge had erred in refusing to consider documents numbered  1-
    17.

24. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Lambert in the following terms;

    1.   The Appellant seeks permission to appeal,  in  time,  against  the
         decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Horvath)  who,  in  a
         determination  promulgated  on  7  February  2014   dismissed   the
         Appellant's appeal against  the  Respondent's  decision  to  refuse
         entry clearance as a spouse under Appendix FM  of  the  Immigration
         Rules.  The Appellant had requested in the appeal notice that it be
         determined on the papers.

    2.   The grounds maintain that the judge should have had regard to  the
         financial documents submitted by the Appellant to the Tribunal  for
         the appeal and received on 20th January 2014.  This was within  the
         time limit given to the Appellant in the appeal notice.  The  judge
         at paragraph 15 of the determination  concluded  that  because  the
         Entry Clearance Officer had not had sight of  these  documents  and
         because of the wording of  Appendix  FM-SE  paragraph  D(a)  as  to
         specified evidence, the  judge  was  precluded  from  taking  those
         documents into account.  He concluded that he could  only  consider
         documents submitted with the application.   There  is  an  arguable
         error of law here, since the judge seems to be conflating the issue
         of what evidence could be considered by the Entry Clearance Officer
         in deciding the application, with that of the evidence  that  could
         be considered by a judge on appeal.

    3.   The judge concluded in paragraph 17 that the marriage had not been
         proved to be genuine.  The reasoning given is  arguably  inadequate
         and the observation that the parties had known  each  other  for  3
         months at the date of application is at odds with the evidence that
         the parties had known each other (via  Facebook  and  phone  calls)
         since 5.11.12 and therefore for just over  four  months  when  they
         married on 7.3.13.

    4.   Given the judge's acceptance of the receipt of  disability  living
         allowance by the Appellant as shown by her bank statements and  the
         fact that she has two children who  are  almost  certainly  British
         citizens, Article 8 was arguably a 'Robinson obvious' point in this
         appeal that should have been dealt with by the  judge  despite  the
         fact that it had not been raised by the Appellant.

    5.   There are therefore  arguable  errors  of  law  disclosed  by  the
         application.

25. The reference to the Appellant in paragraph 4 should be a reference  to
    the Sponsor.

26. Following the grant of permission, the  Respondent  lodged  a  response
    pursuant to rule 24 of The Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 contending that the First-tier Tribunal's  determination  did  not
    disclose a material error of law and should stand.

27. The Tribunal issued directions that there should be  a  hearing  before
    the Upper Tribunal to ascertain whether  the  First-tier  Tribunal  had
    erred such that the decision should be set aside.

The Upper Tribunal Hearing

Preliminary Issues

28. There was no attendance by or  on  behalf  of  the  Appellant.   I  was
    satisfied that proper notice of the hearing had been given  and  having
    considered rule 38 of the 2008 Procedure Rules, was satisfied  that  it
    was in the interests of justice to proceed with the  hearing.   I  took
    into account that the Appellant had written to the First-tier  Tribunal
    indicating that he was still resident in the United  States,  and  that
    the Sponsor had been given permission  to  live  with  him  while  they
    waited for the appeal to be heard.



Error of Law

29. Miss Everett did not rely upon the rule 24 response but  conceded  that
    the judge  had  materially  erred  by  not  considering  the  documents
    numbered 1-17 which had been submitted by the Appellant to the Tribunal
    in response to directions.

30. I decided, with respect to the judge, that he had materially  erred  by
    declining to take into account the documents submitted by the Appellant
    and I indicated to Miss Everett that the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal was set aside and that I would confirm my reasons in writing.

Re-making the Decision

31. Miss Everett advised me that in view of the evidence  contained  within
    the documents numbered 1-17, she conceded that the marriage between the
    Appellant and Sponsor is subsisting, and the evidence proves that  they
    are validly married and that they intend to live  permanently  together
    in the United Kingdom.

32. Miss Everett accepted that adequate accommodation for the parties would
    have been available at the date of refusal, having taken  into  account
    an email from the Sponsor's  landlord  which  is  document  13  in  the
    Appellant's bundle.

33. In relation to maintenance Miss Everett advised that  she  was  content
    for this to be left to  the  Tribunal  to  decide,  but  accepted  that
    evidence had been provided to prove that the Sponsor was in receipt  of
    DLA and therefore was exempt from the income and  savings  requirements
    set out in E-ECP3.1 of Appendix FM.

34. In relation to Article 8 Miss Everett had no submissions to  make  save
    to observe that this had not been raised by the Appellant as  a  ground
    of appeal before the First-tier Tribunal, and  the  evidence  indicated
    that the family were living together in the United States  of  America.
    Therefore Ms Everett submitted Article  8  was  not  before  the  Upper
    Tribunal, but if I decided otherwise, and  if  the  Appellant  did  not
    satisfy the Immigration Rules, refusal  of  entry  clearance  would  be
    proportionate and would not breach Article 8.

35. At the conclusion of oral submissions I reserved my decision.

My Conclusions and Reasons

36. I remind myself, that in relation to the Immigration Rules, the  burden
    of proof is on the Appellant, and the standard of proof  a  balance  of
    probabilities.

37. I also remind myself that as this is an appeal arising  from  an  entry
    clearance application, I must consider the  circumstances  appertaining
    at the  date  of  refusal,  that  being  17  June  2013,  and  not  the
    circumstances appertaining at the date of the hearing.  I  can  however
    take into account evidence arising after the date of refusal, if it  is
    relevant to the circumstances appertaining at the date of refusal.

38. I will set out firstly my  reasons  for  finding  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal erred in law such that the decision had to be set aside.

39. I respectfully take the view that the judge erred in  not  taking  into
    account the documents numbered 1-17 submitted to the  Tribunal  by  the
    Appellant in accordance with directions from the  Tribunal  dated  22nd
    November 2013, which stated that any further evidence must be submitted
    by 20th January 2014.

40. The First-tier Tribunal  (the  FTT)  confirm  in  paragraph  1  of  the
    determination that the documents were submitted by the  deadline  date.
    It is not absolutely clear why in paragraph 15 the FTT found  that  the
    Respondent was  not  afforded  the  opportunity  of  considering  those
    documents.  When documents are submitted in  a  paper  case  by  or  on
    behalf of an Appellant, the FTT  would  normally  make  the  Presenting
    Officers' Unit aware that the documents had  been  submitted,  so  that
    they could be inspected.  It appears to be the case that the  Secretary
    of State has taken a policy decision  not  to  engage  with  an  appeal
    decided on the papers, and therefore documents submitted on  behalf  of
    the Appellant are not inspected.

41. The FTT erred in finding in paragraph 15  of  the  determination,  that
    only those documents submitted with the application could be taken into
    account.  This would be the case, subject  to  certain  exceptions,  if
    this was an appeal  under  the  points-based  system  but  it  is  not.
    Section 85A of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002,  sets
    out the exceptions to the principle that the Tribunal can on an  appeal
    consider evidence about any matter which  it  thinks  relevant  to  the
    substance of the decision, including evidence which concerns  a  matter
    arising after the date of the decision.

42. As previously mentioned, in an entry clearance appeal, the Tribunal can
    only consider the circumstances appertaining at the  date  of  refusal,
    but  this  does  not  mean  that  the  documents  submitted  after  the
    application cannot be considered.

43.  The  documents  numbered  1-17,  contained  evidence   which   merited
    consideration, and should have been considered by the FTT.  Failure  to
    consider those documents amounted to a material error of law  which  is
    why the decision had to be set aside.

44. In re-making the decision I take into  account  the  concession  by  Ms
    Everett, in which it is accepted that the requirements of E-ECP2.6, 2.7
    and 2.10 are satisfied.  In other words it is accepted that the parties
    have a genuine and subsisting relationship, a valid marriage, and  they
    intend to live permanently together in the United Kingdom.

45. In my view this is a concession rightly made.  The  evidence  indicates
    that a valid marriage took place in the United States.  I do  not  find
    that any cogent reason was given by the Respondent for contending  that
    the marriage was not valid.  The parties lived together  prior  to  the
    marriage, in the United Kingdom, and after the marriage in  the  United
    States.  There is documentary evidence to confirm that they have  joint
    bank accounts, joint insurance, that they live together in  the  United
    States, and  that  in  relation  to  the  Sponsor's  daughter  who  was
    attending school in the United States, both the Appellant  and  Sponsor
    are listed as her parents.

46. In relation to accommodation, once again Ms Everett  conceded  that  at
    the date of refusal adequate accommodation was available.   The  reason
    given in the initial refusal notice for  not  accepting  that  adequate
    accommodation was available, was that no  tenancy  agreement  or  other
    documentation had been  submitted  to  confirm  the  ownership  of  the
    property or  that  the  Appellant  had  permission  to  move  in.   The
    Appellant has provided an email from the landlord of the property dated
    12th August 2013, confirming  that  the  property  was  leased  to  the
    Sponsor from December 2011 until August 2013 and that the rent was paid
    as agreed every calendar month.   The  Sponsor's  bank  account  proves
    payment of the rent.  The landlord confirms meeting  the  Appellant  in
    January 2013 and that he stayed with the Sponsor at the property  until
    the end of February 2013.

47. I am satisfied  that  adequate  accommodation  was  available  for  the
    parties at the date of refusal.

48. Turning to the financial requirements I am satisfied that  the  Sponsor
    received DLA.  This is referred to in E-ECP3.3(a)(i) of Appendix FM and
    means that the income and savings requirements set out  in  E-ECP3.1(a)
    and (b) need not be satisfied.  However E-ECP3.3(b) stipulates that;

    (b)  the applicant must provide evidence that their partner is able  to
         maintain  and  accommodate  themselves,  the  applicant   and   any
         dependants adequately in the UK without recourse to public funds.

49. There is still therefore a  requirement  of  adequate  maintenance  and
    accommodation without recourse to public funds.

50. There is also a requirement that specified evidence must be provided to
    prove that the Sponsor receives DLA.  This is set out in  paragraph  12
    of Appendix FM-SE, which requires that official documentation from  the
    DWP  confirming  the  entitlement  and  the  amount  received  must  be
    submitted, together with at least one personal bank  statement  in  the
    twelve month period prior to the date of application showing payment of
    the benefit or allowance into the person's account.

51. The Sponsor provided her bank statements covering a period between 23rd
    July 2012 and 1st August 2012, and 22nd  January  2013  to  22nd  March
    2013.  These statements showed weekly payments of DLA  of  �72.40.   In
    addition the Appellant submitted a letter from the DWP dated 8th  March
    2013 addressed to the Sponsor, confirming her entitlement to  DLA,  and
    the amount received.

52. I am therefore satisfied that the income and savings requirements in E-
    ECP3.1 need not be met in this case, but there must still  be  evidence
    that  adequate  maintenance  is  available.   In  my  view  this  means
    considering the adequacy of maintenance principles set out in the  case
    law which gave guidance on this issue  prior  to  the  changes  in  the
    Immigration Rules on 9th July 2012.

53. I have therefore taken into account the guidance given by the  Tribunal
    in KA and Others (Pakistan) [2006] UKAIT  00065.   The  requirement  of
    adequacy of maintenance is objective.  The level of  income  and  other
    benefits that would be available if the  parties  were  drawing  income
    support remains the yardstick.   The  parties  must  prove  that  after
    payment of accommodation costs, they have an income equivalent to  what
    would be received by a family in receipt of income support.

54. At the date of refusal a couple in  receipt  of  income  support  would
    receive �112.55 per week, and  �65.62  for  each  dependent  child.   A
    couple with two children would therefore receive �243.79 per week, with
    child benefit of approximately �33.70 giving a total weekly  income  of
    �277.49.

55. I find that on a weekly basis the Sponsor's income at the relevant time
    was �111.52 child tax credit, �72.40 DLA, �110.85  incapacity  benefit,
    and approximately �33.70 child benefit making a total  of  �328.47  per
    week.

56. I accept that the Sponsor received council tax  benefit  and  therefore
    did not have to make those payments, and that the monthly rent  on  her
    property is �470 per month.  The Sponsor received  housing  benefit  of
    �415.40 per month and therefore had to contribute �12.60  per  week  by
    way of rent.  If this amount is deducted from the figure of �328.47, it
    gives a weekly income of �315.87.

57. This figure exceeds what a family in receipt of  income  support  would
    receive, which was the figure of �277.49.  Therefore on that basis, the
    Sponsor's income is adequate to maintain the family of four.

58. This does not take into account the Appellant's income that  he  states
    he would continue to receive from his employment because his employment
    is internet based,  nor does  it  take  into  account  the  Appellant's
    savings, which the Appellant had  proved  by  submission  of  his  bank
    statements covering a period between 18th May 2013 and 19th  June  2013
    which showed a balance in his account of approximately $18,171.

59. For the reasons given above, I conclude that the issues raised  by  the
    Respondent in the refusal notice have  been  satisfactorily  addressed,
    the  Appellant  satisfies  the  requirements  of  Appendix  FM  of  the
    Immigration Rules, and on that basis the appeal is allowed.

60. I therefore do not consider it necessary to go on and consider  Article
    8 of the 1950 Convention, which in any event has not been  relied  upon
    as a ground of appeal by the Appellant.

Decision

The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contained an error of  law  and
was set aside.

I substitute a fresh decision.

The appeal is allowed under the Immigration Rules.



Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal made no anonymity  direction.   There  has  been  no
request for anonymity and the Upper Tribunal makes no anonymity order.

Fee Award

As the appeal is allowed I have considered whether to make a fee  award.   I
do not consider it appropriate.  The evidence which I found to be  relevant,
was not produced with the application  and  therefore  was  not  before  the
initial decision-maker.  There is therefore no fee award.
