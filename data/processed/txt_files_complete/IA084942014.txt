Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Fazal Begum, date of birth  12.4.31,  is  a  citizen  of
    Pakistan.

 2. This is her appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Mathews promulgated  27.6.14  allowing  her  appeal  against  the
    decision of the respondent, dated 22.1.14, to  refuse  her  application
    for leave to remain in the UK on grounds of  private  and  family  life
    outside the Immigration Rules.  The Judge heard the appeal on  17.6.14.



 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Osborne  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    21.8.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 24.10.14 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Mathews should be set aside.

 6. The relevant background to the appeal can be summarised as follows. The
    appellant came to the UK as a family  visitor  in  September  2003,  to
    visit and nurse her husband who had settled here  in  1993,  but  whose
    health was failing. She did not leave and thus  became  an  overstayer.
    The appellant made a number of applications for leave to remain, all of
    which were refused. In 2004 she twice applied to remain  as  a  spouse.
    Her husband died in 2007 and in 2009 she applied for  indefinite  leave
    to remain. Despite the several refusal decisions the appellant did  not
    return to Pakistan. Her own health began to fail in 2013  and  she  has
    received and continues to receive extensive NHS treatment to which  she
    was not entitled, including GP care and as a  hospital  inpatient.  She
    lives with her son and his family, on whom she is dependent, and claims
    to have no remaining family in Pakistan and no viable  home  to  return
    to.

 7. Judge Mathews purported to allow the appeal, but on the basis  that  as
    there had been a failure to consider the family life of  the  appellant
    the decision of the Secretary of State was not in accordance  with  the
    law and that it remained for the Secretary of State to  make  a  lawful
    decision.

 8. Thus though the appeal was allowed, the appellant has  appealed.  There
    has been no cross-appeal by the Secretary of  State  and  the  Rule  24
    response does not address any of the issues in the appeal.

 9. Quite apart from the other errors of law detailed below,  the  decision
    to allow the appeal on the basis that the refusal decision was  not  in
    accordance with the law was itself an error of law. Under section 86 of
    the 2002 Act the Tribunal is required to determine any matter raised as
    a ground of appeal. To fail to do  so  could  amount  to  a  breach  of
    section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.  The  judge  should  have  gone
    ahead to deal with the family life claim of the appellant.

10. The grounds of application for permission to  appeal  assert  that  the
    appeal did not depend on the exercise of any discretion, as at  �23  of
    the determination the judge made findings that should have enabled  the
    appeal to succeed under the Immigration Rules, in particular  paragraph
    276ADE(vi), or alternatively outside the Rules on the basis of  article
    8 family life. At �23 the judge found that the appellant no longer  has
    any family in Pakistan, her home is no longer habitable, and  that  she
    is not in contact with any friends in Pakistan.

11. In granting permission to appeal, Judge  Osborne  noted  that,  "In  an
    otherwise focused and succinct determination it is  arguable  that  the
    Judge having made the above-mentioned findings at [23] should have gone
    on to allow the appeal under the Immigration Rules.  As  this  arguable
    error of law has been identified, all the issues raised in the  grounds
    are arguable."

12. Having considered �23, I find that  the  judge  should  have  at  least
    considered paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules in relation to the
    existence of ties, including social, cultural and family with Pakistan.
    That was not addressed in the determination and the judge  simply  went
    on to find that the Secretary of  State  had  failed  to  consider  the
    appellant's claimed family life as a dependant of  her  adult  children
    and wider family settled in the UK. At �21 the  judge  found  that  the
    appellant's health had further deteriorated  and  that  she  could  not
    travel alone, live alone or live independently. At �25 the  judge  also
    suggested that the  appellant's  medical  condition  may  amount  to  a
    "central element of her private life."

13. Whilst the appellant  could  probably  not  meet  the  requirements  of
    Appendix FM, the judge of the First-tier Tribunal should have addressed
    paragraph 276ADE  before  going  on  to  consider  whether  there  were
    compelling circumstances not adequately recognised in  the  Immigration
    Rules such as to justify allowing the appeal on the grounds of  private
    and/or family life article 8 ECHR outside the Rules, on that basis that
    the decision of the Secretary of  State  produced  a  result  that  was
    unjustifiably harsh,  or  was  otherwise  disproportionate.  The  judge
    failed to tackle the issues by  applying  the  correct  law  and  legal
    approach to the findings apparently made.

14. It follows that the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  cannot  stand
    and must be set aside and remade, even though that will involve  rather
    different considerations now applicable, including section 117B of  the
    2002 Act.

15. When a decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside,  section
    12(2) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 requires either
    that the case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  with  directions,
    or it must be remade by the Upper Tribunal. The scheme of the Tribunals
    Court and Enforcement Act 2007 does not assign the function of  primary
    fact finding to the Upper Tribunal. Where a crucial issue at the  heart
    of an appeal is unresolved, as in this case, effectively there has  not
    been a valid determination of that issue. The errors of the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge vitiates all the findings of fact  and  the  conclusions
    from those facts so that there has not been a  valid  determination  of
    the issues in the appeal.

16. In all the circumstances, at the invitation and request of both parties
    to relist this appeal for a fresh hearing in the First-tier Tribunal, I
    do so on the basis that this is a case which falls squarely within  the
    Senior President's Practice Statement at paragraph 7.2. The  effect  of
    the error has been to deprive the appellant of a fair hearing and  that
    the nature or extent of any judicial fact finding  which  is  necessary
    for the decision in the appeal to  be  re-made  is  such  that,  having
    regard to the overriding objective in rule 2 to deal with cases  fairly
    and justly, including with the avoidance of delay, I find  that  it  is
    appropriate  to  remit  this  appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    determine the appeal afresh.

Conclusion & Decision

17. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making  of  an  error  on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set  aside,  remitted  to
    the First-tier Tribunal to be remade, with no facts preserved.

     I set aside the decision.

     I remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal to be made afresh.

Consequential Directions

18. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal at Stoke on Trent for
    hearing listed for 20.2.15.

19. No findings of fact are preserved  and  the  appeal  is  to  be  remade
    afresh.



Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.




Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The outcome of the appeal remains to be determined.
