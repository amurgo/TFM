Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr R Jesurum, Counsel, instructed by Everest Law
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a national of Nepal who was born in February 1983,  so
    he is currently 36 years old.  He is the son of an  ex-Ghurkha  soldier
    who served in the Ghurkha regiment from the ages of 21 to 28.  When  he
    left the service of the regiment at that time he was  not  entitled  to
    settle in the UK; that has now been recognised as an  "historic  wrong"
    and it is common ground that had the law at that time  been  as  it  is
    now, he would have been entitled to settle in the UK.  It has not  been
    disputed either by the respondent that had  he  done  so  his  children
    would have been born in the UK and  accordingly  this  appellant  would
    have been a British citizen or at the very least entitled to  permanent
    residence in this country.

 2. The appellant's mother died when he was 10 years  old  and  his  father
    remarried.  As is clear from the statement of his stepmother  which  is
    within the file, he is regarded by her as a child of  the  family,  and
    her statement is exceedingly supportive of him.

 3. In 2004 the appellant's father (who is the sponsor) had a stroke and it
    is the appellant's case, as set out in particular in  his  stepmother's
    statement (which does not appear to have been disputed at any  time  by
    or on behalf of the respondent) that the appellant himself  effectively
    put his life on hold in order to look after his father.  He would carry
    him when it was necessary for him to be taken for medical treatment and
    he also looked after his physical intimate needs.  This care  continued
    for very many years to beyond when in 2008 the  sponsor  had  a  second
    stroke.  He has clearly been very ill for many years, such that in  the
    stepmother's opinion (as set out at paragraph 9 of her statement)  "had
    it not been for [the appellant] it would have been impossible for us to
    keep him alive".  It appears that  somewhat  understandably  this  ill-
    health put a huge strain on the family's finances, such  that  in  2015
    the sponsor and his wife decided to come to the UK.  By so  doing  they
    were enabled to get the benefit of treatment  on  the  National  Health
    Service to which the sponsor was entitled by reason of his past service
    with the Ghurkha regiment but a consequence of their coming to  the  UK
    was that the appellant, being by that time over 30, was not  under  the
    policy then in force entitled to come to the UK  with  his  father  and
    stepmother under that policy.  Only the two children of the sponsor and
    his second wife were able to come with their parents.

 4. When they came to the UK the sponsor and his wife left  behind  between
    �1,500 and �2,000 for the use of the  appellant  and  his  siblings  in
    order to enable them to maintain themselves for a  year  or  two.   The
    sponsor also sends money from time to time whenever he  can  to  assist
    his son and his other children.

 5. The appellant has subsequently applied for leave to  enter  the  UK  to
    join the sponsor, as the adult  dependent  relative  of  an  ex-Ghurkha
    settled  in  the  United  Kingdom.   The  basis  of  the   application,
    consistent with current case law is that first  but  for  what  is  now
    regarded by the courts as the  "historic  injustice"  (whereby  Ghurkha
    members of the UK forces were not permitted to settle at the conclusion
    of their service) he would have, in his case, been born in the  UK  and
    therefore entitled to remain here and secondly there was  still  family
    life for Article 8 purposes between himself and  his  father,  the  ex-
    Ghurkha soldier.

 6. The application was refused essentially because the respondent did  not
    accept there was still family life between the appellant and his father
    and the appellant appealed as against this decision.

 7. This appeal was heard before First-tier Tribunal Judge Watson,  sitting
    at Birmingham on 31 July 2019 but in a decision and reasons promulgated
    some five days later on  5  August  2019  Judge  Watson  dismissed  the
    appeal.  The appellant now appeals against this decision, leave  having
    been granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Pickup on 29 October 2019.

 8. When setting out his reasons for granting permission to  appeal,  Judge
    Pickup stated as follows:

         "1.  It is arguable that the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  erred  in
             addressing  family  life  between  the   appellant   and   the
             sponsoring parents in the UK in this Ghurkha case and may have
             applied too strict a test, one primarily focused on  financial
             dependency.  The decision is  arguably  inadequately  reasoned
             with respect to the historical injustice  considerations.   It
             is also arguable that the judge had conflated the existence of
             family life with the issue of proportionality.

         2.   Whilst on the facts of this case the appellant may  ultimately
             struggle to succeed, there is  sufficient  basis  of  arguable
             error to justify a closer examination of the issues.  ..."

 9. Mr Jesurum in  his  submissions  took  the  Tribunal  through  all  the
    relevant case law in some considerable detail but it will  suffice  for
    the present purposes if I simply state that  it  is  clear  from  these
    decisions (the law being summarised in particular  in  the  2013  Upper
    Tribunal decision in Ghising and others (Ghurkas/BOCs: historic  wrong;
    weight) [2013] UKUT 561) that provided it can properly be said that but
    for the "historic injustice" a claimant would  have  been  entitled  to
    remain in the UK and also there was  still  family  life  between  that
    claimant and the ex-Ghurkha soldier, then absent  some  special  factor
    (such as for example a criminal record such as to make that  claimant's
    entry to the UK unsuitable) a claim to be allowed to join  his  or  her
    parent ought to succeed.

10. In this case, it is said first that the judge failed to appreciate that
    the "but for" test in this case was not disputed and secondly that  the
    judge did not adequately consider the issue of whether or not there was
    still  family  life  between  this  appellant  and  his  father  before
    determining that there was not.

11. So far as the first issue is concerned,  it  is  clear  that,  in  this
    particular case, that is not an  issue  which  the  respondent  has  in
    reality challenged.  Accordingly, the crucial issue  in  this  case  is
    whether or not there was, at the time of the application, for Article 8
    purposes, a family life between the appellant and his father which goes
    beyond the normal relationship to be found between an adult  child  and
    his parent (as discussed in the leading authority of Kugathas).

12. The judge, at paragraph 23 of her decision, sets out the question which
    she considers needs properly to be asked as "Has  the  appellant  shown
    family life, emotional and [my emphasis] financial dependence upon  the
    sponsor?".

13. On behalf of the appellant, Mr Jesurum submits that that is  the  wrong
    test, because it is not necessary for Article 8 purposes to  show  both
    emotional and financial dependence upon the sponsor; the issue  is  the
    closeness of the ties and "financial dependence"  is  not  a  necessary
    element before that can be established.

14. At paragraph 27 the judge found as follows:

         "I find that the appellant has not shown  that  he  is  financially
         dependent upon the sponsor for  all  [again  my  emphasis]  of  his
         living costs.  Some money has been left in Nepal and I accept  that
         the sponsor does what he can and that  it  will  have  assisted  in
         financial support but I do not find that  the  appellant  has  been
         significantly supported by his  father  in  the  recent  past  (ten
         years) nor is he now".

15. Again, Mr Jesurum submits that this is  the  wrong  test.   It  is  not
    necessary for a claimant to establish, in order to show that  there  is
    still family life in existence with his or her ex-Ghurkha parent,  that
    that parent provides all of the financial support necessary for his  or
    her living.

16. In my judgment, Mr Jesurum's submission is correct in this regard,  and
    if and to the extent  that  this  was  the  test  that  the  judge  was
    applying, it was, in the words of  DJ  Pickup,  when  setting  out  his
    reasons for granting permission "too strict a test".

17. The judge also finds at paragraph 31 that even if he is  "wrong  in  my
    assessment of the engagement of Article 8, I would  find  that  despite
    the historic wrong ... the decision  is  proportionate".   Again,  this
    aspect of the decision appears to be at odds  with  decided  authority,
    which is that if Article 8 is engaged in  a  case  where  but  for  the
    historic wrong a claimant would have been able either to come with  his
    or her parent to the UK or to have been born  here,  then  absent  some
    other feature which is not present in  this  case,  that  person  would
    expect to be allowed now to join his or her parent.

18. Mr Jesurum also challenges what is said towards the end of the decision
    by the judge that she "cannot look back and make assumptions  that  the
    appellant would have been born in the UK, ...." Because, as  he  notes,
    this  aspect  of  the  application  had  not  been  challenged  by  the
    respondent and nor on the facts could it be.

19. Mr Jesurum also submits that the final paragraph of the  decision  that
    "if Article 8 is engaged I find that the decision remains proportionate
    in all the circumstances of both the sponsor and the appellant for  the
    same reasons noted above" also is at odds with the  current  case  law,
    and in that I agree he is correct.

20. Notwithstanding what appears to have been errors within the decision as
    briefly discussed above, Mr Avery on behalf of the respondent,  submits
    that these errors are not material, because the judge did in any  event
    consider whether or not there was family  life  properly  to  be  found
    between the appellant  and  his  father  for  Article  8  purposes  and
    concluded that there was not.  Having found that the appellant had  not
    been "significantly supported by his father in  the  recent  past  (ten
    years) nor is he now" the judge then went on to find at paragraph 28 as
    follows:

          "I find that there are no emotional ties over and above those of a
         normal adult person of 30 who has lived with  parents  in  a  large
         family.  The appellant has shown no particular emotional dependence
         upon the sponsor".

21. The judge was  also  concerned  that  in  the  application  itself  the
    appellant's claim was significantly overstated; for example he  claimed
    to be living alone whereas in fact, as was clear from the evidence,  he
    had always lived with his three siblings.

22. Had the  judge  considered  fully  all  the  evidence  properly  before
    concluding that there were not emotional ties over and above  those  to
    be expected within a normal relationship between a parent  and  his  or
    her adult child, it may be that the errors, as discussed  above,  would
    not have been material, because if in the event  there  was  no  family
    life within Article 8 then notwithstanding the "historic injustice" the
    appellant would not have been entitled to join his father  in  the  UK.
    However, it is not clear from the decision that the judge  took  proper
    account of the very unusual features in this case and in particular the
    huge contribution made by the appellant to support his father for  very
    many years (between 2004 to 2015) and also  the  considerable  distress
    which  (according  to  the  evidence  of  his  stepmother)  his  father
    continues to suffer because  of  his  separation  from  the  appellant.
    Furthermore, the judge throughout her decision does refer to  the  need
    to show both "significant financial and emotional dependency" (repeated
    at paragraph 31) which is not the test.  Nor is  it  the  test  as  the
    judge also says at paragraph 31 that "public  interest  in  immigration
    control is such that  the  decision  is  proportionate",  as  discussed
    above.

23. Accordingly, although this decision is  perhaps  more  finely  balanced
    than some, nonetheless the errors identified above are, in the judgment
    of this Tribunal, material.

24. It follows that this decision will have to be remade  and  because  for
    logistical reasons it may not be  possible  for  the  rehearing  to  be
    before myself such that a transfer order  would  be  necessary,  it  is
    appropriate (because there will have to be  a  full  rehearing  on  the
    evidence) for the appeal to be remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal
    for rehearing by any judge other than First-tier Tribunal Judge Watson,
    and I will so order.



Notice of Decision

The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Watson is set aside as  containing
material errors of law and this appeal will be remitted back to  the  First-
tier Tribunal, sitting at Taylor House, for a complete  rehearing,  with  no
findings of fact retained.

No anonymity direction is made.
