For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

1.   This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Feeney promulgated on 8 January 2019 in which he dismissed  the  appeal
    of Mr Muhammad Yasir Anwar against a decision of the  Respondent  dated
    12 April 2016 to refuse an application under the EEA Regulations for  a
    residence card.

2.   The Appellant is a citizen of  Pakistan  born  on  19  June  1977.   He
    entered the  United  Kingdom  on  4  January  2009  pursuant  to  entry
    clearance as a visitor.  It is said that he has remained in the  United
    Kingdom since that time, having necessarily become an  overstayer  upon
    the expiry of the six months' leave to enter that he  would  have  been
    granted as a visitor.

3.   The Appellant was served with documents as  an  overstayer  on  1  July
    2014. On 31 July 2014 he  made  an  application  for  leave  to  remain
    relying on Article 8 of the ECHR.  The application was refused with  no
    right of appeal.

4.   More recently, the Appellant made an application for a  residence  card
    on 14 October 2015: it is this application and its refusal that are the
    subject of these proceedings.

5.   The Appellant's application for a  residence  card  was  based  on  his
    relationship with Mr [SA] (d.o.b. [~] 1962), a national of Germany.  Mr
    [A] is the Appellant's maternal cousin - a relationship that  seemingly
    has not ever been in dispute.

6.   The  exact  citizenship  or  nationality  history  of  Mr  [A]  is  not
    immediately apparent from the materials before the First-tier Tribunal.
     The application form completed by the  Appellant  in  support  of  his
    claim to be issued with a residence card indicates at section 2.10 that
    Mr [A] has never held any nationality other  than  German  nationality.
    The factual matrix of  the  case  suggests  that  that  was  erroneous.
    Indeed it is part of the Appellant's case that he was a member  of  the
    Mr [A]'s household in Pakistan when Mr [A] left  Pakistan  to  come  to
    Europe to work and to send remittances back to Pakistan.

7.   The identification documents that were provided in respect  of  Mr  [A]
    comprise a national identity card and a copy of  the  personal  details
    page of his passport: see for example the Appellant's bundle before the
    First-tier Tribunal at pages 20-22.  The national identity card - which
    it seems to me is not inevitably, without more, evidence of nationality
    rather than merely residence - appears to have  been  issued  in  March
    2014.   The  passport,  which  of  course  I  accept  is  evidence   of
    nationality, has an issue date of 7 March 2014.  Before me  Mr  Gajjar,
    having taken instructions from the Appellant, confirmed that  this  was
    Mr [A]'s first  German  passport.  It  follows  that  Mr  [A]  did  not
    seemingly acquire German nationality until in or about early 2014.

8.   As I have noted, such matters were  not  manifestly  clear  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal, but have been clarified to me for the purposes  of
    the proceedings before the Upper Tribunal.

9.   It is said that Mr [A] entered the  United  Kingdom  in  January  2015,
    taking employment in a convenience store shortly afterwards and thereby
    exercising his 'Treaty rights' as a worker.

10.  It was the Appellant's case that he began to live with Mr [A]  upon  Mr
    [A]'s arrival in the United Kingdom, and that he  has  remained  living
    with him both as a dependant and as a  member  of  his  household  ever
    since.

11.  The Appellant's application for a residence card was refused by way  of
    a Notice of Immigration Decision dated 12 April 2016 with reference  to
    regulation 8 of the Immigration (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations
    2006 for reasons set out  in  an  accompanying  'reasons  for  refusal'
    letter ('RFRL').

12.  The Appellant appealed to the IAC.

13.  Before the case reached Judge Feeney it had to, as it were,  'navigate'
    the effects of the Sala case law: the Appellant's appeal was  initially
    dealt with on the basis that there was no right of appeal for a  person
    claiming to be an 'extended family member'; a decision to  this  effect
    was then set aside, and in due course  the  matter  was  listed  before
    Judge Feeney on 30 November 2018.

14.  The appeal was dismissed for the reasons set out  in  the  decision  of
    Judge Feeney promulgated on 8 January 2019.

15.  The Appellant applied for permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal
    which was granted on 8 February 2019.

Consideration

16.  I turn first to a consideration  of  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge, before considering the grounds of appeal that  seek  to
    impugn the decision.

17.  At paragraph 4 the  Judge  set  out  the  provisions  of  regulation  8
    insofar as they were relevant.  It is helpful to repeat them here:

         "8(2)    A person satisfies the condition in this paragraph if  the
                person is a relative of an EEA national, his spouse  or  his
                civil partner and -

                (a)    the person is/was residing in a  country  other  than
                    the United Kingdom and is/was  dependent  upon  the  EEA
                    national or is a member of his household;

                (b)    the person satisfied the condition in  paragraph  (a)
                    and is accompanying  the  EEA  national  to  the  United
                    Kingdom or wishes to join him there; or

                (c)    the person satisfied the condition in paragraph  (a),
                    has joined the EEA national in the  United  Kingdom  and
                    continues to be dependent upon him or to be a member  of
                    his household."

18.  The Judge directed himself to the case of  Dauhoo  (EEA  Regulations  -
    reg 8(2)) [2012] UKUT 79 (see paragraph 5  of  the  decision),  and  in
    particular identified  the  four  possible  permutations  derived  from
    regulation 8 in which the regulation might be satisfied with respect to
    either prior dependency  or  prior  membership  of  the  household  and
    present dependency and/or present membership of the household.

19.  At paragraph 10 the Judge noted that Mr [A]  was  not  present  at  the
    hearing, being unable to attend because he had travelled to Pakistan in
    consequence of the recent demise of his mother.  It is noted that there
    was evidence of this circumstance. The Judge  consequently  raised  the
    question of an adjournment  with  the  Appellant's  representative  who
    responded by indicating his instructions were to proceed in the absence
    of the Mr [A]. The appeal proceeded accordingly.

20.  In the Decision of the First-tier Tribunal,  the  Judge  has  rehearsed
    the substance of the Respondent's case (paragraph  11)  before  setting
    out  the  substance  of  the  Appellant's  case   (paragraphs   12-14).
    Paragraph 12 deals in general terms with the Appellant's  circumstances
    after his arrival in the United Kingdom; it is  paragraphs  13  and  14
    that record the essence  of  the  case  in  respect  of  membership  of
    household and/or dependency:

         "13. [The Appellant] explained that prior to his arrival in the  UK
             he was living  with  the  sponsor's  wife  and  children  (the
             sponsor was working in Germany at the time).  He  moved  there
             at his mother's request, to look after  the  sponsor's  family
             while he was  working  in  Germany.   He  explained  that  the
             sponsor would send money to his wife and  then  the  sponsor's
             wife would give money to the appellant who would then bear the
             expenses of the family.

         14.  He also explained that the sponsor sent him money while he was
             in the UK.  He sent  the  appellant  ï¿½35  per  week.   As  the
             appellant did not have a bank account at the time, the sponsor
             would give money to his friends  who  came  to  visit  him  in
             Germany and they would then give this to  the  appellant  when
             they returned to the UK."

21.  I pause to  note  that  there  is  no  suggestion  in  the  grounds  of
    challenge to the Upper Tribunal that the First-tier Tribunal Judge  had
    misunderstood the essential basis of the Appellant's  case,  and  there
    was no suggestion that the First-tier Tribunal Judge had  misunderstood
    or failed to accurately record the substance of  the  Appellant's  oral
    evidence before the First-tier Tribunal.

22.  The Judge then proceeded to make findings  of  fact,  setting  out  his
    reasons in the process.

23.  At paragraph 16 the Judge expressly stated that he  accepted  that  the
    Appellant and the EEA national "are cousins".  However,  at  paragraphs
    17 and 18 the Judge rejected the claims of prior dependency  and  prior
    membership of Mr [A]'s  household.   These  particular  paragraphs  are
    germane to the outcome; accordingly I set them out in full here:

         "17. I reject that there was prior dependency in this case:

             a)   In Section 6  of  the  application  form,  the  appellant
                  claimed that he did not receive any money from the sponsor
                  or from other relatives or friends prior to his arrival in
                  the UK.   This  is  at  odds  with  what  he  now  claims,
                  specifically that the sponsor  transferred  money  to  his
                  wife who then gave it to the  appellant  to  use  to  look
                  after the family.

             b)   No documentary evidence has been provided  to  show  that
                  money was transferred to Pakistan in this way.

             c)   Even taken at its highest, the appellant was living  with
                  the sponsor's family to look after them; if  anything  the
                  sponsor was dependent on the appellant  to  care  for  his
                  family in his absence, not the other way round.

             d)   The appellant told me his mother asked him to go to  live
                  with his cousin to look after the family while the sponsor
                  was away.  This is inconsistent with his witness statement
                  which states that he and  his  cousin  lived  together  in
                  Pakistan prior to that.

             e)   There is limited explanation as to why he did not work or
                  why  he  was  unable  to  provide  for  himself  while  in
                  Pakistan.

             f)   I do not accept  that  the  sponsor  sent  money  to  the
                  appellant in the UK while he was in Germany.   Aside  from
                  the appellant's  own  evidence  and  the  content  of  his
                  sponsor's statement, there is limited  other  evidence  to
                  show that money was given to the appellant.  The appellant
                  explains that money was sent to him  from  his  uncle  via
                  friends.  There are no witness statements from friends  to
                  show  that  this  was  the  method  used.   There  is   no
                  explanation as to why money was not transferred  to  their
                  accounts instead.

             g)   He lived in accommodation rented by his friends and  even
                  if I were to accept that his uncle sent him ï¿½35  per  week
                  he does not adequately explain how he was able to meet the
                  costs of rent, utilities, travel and other expenses (aside
                  from food which he claims he  was  given  by  the  mosque)
                  during that time.  I have taken into account the  guidance
                  in Lim [2015] EWCA Civ 1383.  The issue  to  determine  is
                  whether the appellant was able to support himself or  not,
                  even if there  is  financial  support  given  by  the  EEA
                  sponsor.  For reasons set out above, I  am  not  satisfied
                  based on the evidence before me that the appellant is able
                  to show that he was dependent on his uncle  prior  to  his
                  arrival in the UK.

         18.  I do not accept that the appellant was part of  the  sponsor's
             household.  These are my reasons:

             a)   There is limited evidence to show that the appellant  was
                  living with the sponsor's family in Pakistan.  I note  the
                  contents of the sponsor's statement but  the  evidence  is
                  limited to an assertion that they were part  of  the  same
                  household in Pakistan.  The sponsor has  not  been  cross-
                  examined on his  evidence  and  no  adjournment  has  been
                  sought to give the respondent an opportunity to  test  his
                  evidence during the hearing.  No documentary evidence  has
                  been provided to support the claim.

             b)   In his application form the appellant claims he was not a
                  member of the sponsor's household before coming to the UK.



             c)   The appellant was resident here for 6 years prior to  the
                  sponsor's arrival.  He claims he  lived  with  friends  in
                  accommodation which they rented.  He could not be said  to
                  have been part of  the  sponsor's  household  during  this
                  time."

24.  The Judge otherwise accepted  that  the  Appellant  and  Mr  [A]  lived
    together in the United Kingdom: as such he did not  appear  to  dispute
    the claim that there was a current sharing of household,  or  that  the
    Appellant was dependent upon Mr [A] (in respect  of  whom  evidence  of
    income was filed before the First-tier Tribunal).

25.  The grounds of appeal - which were  ably  developed  before  me  by  Mr
    Gajjar - take issue in the first instance with the Judge's reference to
    Mr [A] being the uncle of the Appellant, rather than his cousin.

26.  I have already quoted above one such instance, from paragraph 17(g)  of
    the Decision.  There are two  further  instances  in  the  decision  at
    paragraphs 20 and 21.  It is submitted that this  is  indicative  of  a
    lack of attention to the facts and details of the case.

27.  It is further submitted that this circumstance needs to  be  considered
    alongside the Judge's apparent oversight of supporting documents  which
    were particularly germane to the question of whether the Appellant  was
    a member of Mr [A]'s household in Pakistan.  It is  argued  that  these
    two matters taken together  are  indicative  of  a  deficiency  in  the
    Judge's level of scrutiny of the facts and details  of  the  case  that
    effectively render the conclusions unsound, and vulnerable to being set
    aside on the basis of error of law.

28.  In respect of the oversight  of  supporting  documents,  the  Appellant
    emphasises in particular the final sentence of paragraph  18(a)  quoted
    above - "No documentary evidence  has  been  provided  to  support  the
    claim". Further to this, my attention was  directed  to  two  documents
    that appear at pages 25 and 26 of the  Appellant's  bundle  before  the
    First-tier  Tribunal.   These  photocopied  documents  are  essentially
    similar in nature:  they  are  electricity  bills  for  the  Faisalabad
    Electric Supply Company for the bill month  March  2006  and  the  bill
    month May 2006 respectively, and under the section 'Name  and  address'
    the names of both the Appellant and Mr [A] appear.

29.  The grounds also plead that the Judge erred in failing to  engage  with
    Article 8 of the ECHR.  That was not a matter to  which  any  reference
    was made in the grant of permission to appeal, and it is not  a  matter
    that has been pursued before me by Mr Gajjar.  It is of course the case
    that no such ground of appeal was available to the Appellant before the
    First-tier Tribunal. Accordingly I say nothing more on this point.

30.  I am not persuaded that there is any material substance  to  the  point
    raised in respect of the Judge's inadvertent reference to Mr [A] as  an
    uncle rather than a cousin.  It seems to me absolutely clear  from  the
    Decision read as a  whole  that  the  Judge  was  alert  to  the  exact
    relationship between the Appellant and Mr [A]: indeed he  is  overt  at
    paragraph 16 in stating the nature of that relationship.  In context it
    seems to me that the references to 'uncle' rather than 'cousin' are  to
    be seen as mere slips.  In any event it is difficult to see that it has
    made any material effect on the Judge's analysis of  other  aspects  of
    the evidence. Nor do I consider there is any basis for concluding  that
    such errors are indicative of a failure to  engage  properly  with  the
    material issues in the appeal.  Accordingly, whether taken in isolation
    or in combination with other points, I see no merit  in  this  line  of
    challenge.

31.  The Appellant's  challenge  in  respect  of  the  documentary  evidence
    having seemingly been overlooked, however, has more merit.

32.  Mr Avery on behalf of the Respondent appropriately points out that  the
    documents alone could not be determinative of the issue as  to  whether
    or not the Appellant was a member of Mr [A]'s  household  in  Pakistan.
    He  also  appropriately  points  out  that  the  documents   are   mere
    photocopies, and to that extent the weight to be accorded  them  should
    be considered diminished.  In contrast,  Mr  Gajjar  says  that  whilst
    there may be arguments as to the evidential weight to be accorded these
    documents, they should properly have been the subject  of  scrutiny  by
    the First-tier Tribunal.  I can  see  the  force  to  that  submission.
    However, it seems to me that this needs to be considered in  the  wider
    context of the appeal, and ultimately I  have  reached  the  conclusion
    that if there is an error in this regard it is not material, and  could
    not have made any difference to  the  outcome.   Accordingly,  even  if
    there were an error I would not be prepared to exercise the  discretion
    in section 12(2) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act  2007  to
    set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

33.  I shall expand upon this below. However, before doing  so  I  note  one
    further matter.

34.  During the course of discussion Mr Gajja took issue with  the  contents
    of paragraph 18(c) of the Decision in so far as it appeared to have  as
    its premise the  notion  that  the  Appellant  could  not  satisfy  the
    requirement in respect of prior membership of the  sponsor's  household
    because he had arrived in the United Kingdom some six years prior to Mr
    [A] and had therefore not  been  residing  in  Mr  [A]'s  household  in
    Pakistan for a considerable period prior to Mr [A] joining him  in  the
    United Kingdom. (This was not a matter expressly pleaded in the  rounds
    of appeal.)

35.  My attention was directed  to  the  case  of  Aladeselu  and  others  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2013]  EWCA  Civ  144,  in
    particular at paragraphs 48 and 49.  Those paragraphs indicate that  it
    is not a prerequisite that an applicant has either been a member of the
    EEA national's household immediately prior to their  being  in  the  UK
    together, or that the order of arrival is such that the applicant might
    not arrive before the EEA national. It was suggested  that  this  again
    undermined the Judge's findings in  respect  of  the  issue  of  'prior
    household'.

36.  However, in my judgement both of these matters - the oversight  of  the
    photocopies of utility bills, and the unpleaded criticism of  paragraph
    18(c) utility - are essentially immaterial because of what is  said  in
    the case of Moneke (EEA - OFMs) Nigeria [2011] UKUT 341 (IAC).

37.  Paragraph 2 of the headnote of Moneke states:

         "In either case the dependency or membership of the household  must
         be on a person who is an EEA national at the  material  time.   For
         this reason it is essential that tribunal judges establish when the
         sponsor acquired EEA nationality."

38.  The discussion referred to at the beginning of this decision  makes  it
    plain that the Mr [A] acquired his EEA nationality in early 2014.  This
    would have been approximately five years after  the  Appellant  entered
    the United Kingdom as a visitor.  It necessarily follows that  even  if
    the Judge is  wrong  in  his  finding  in  respect  of  'household'  in
    Pakistan, the Appellant would have  left  the  Mr  [A]'s  household  in
    Pakistan some five years prior to Mr [A] becoming an EEA national: thus
    it cannot be said that the Appellant was the member of a  household  of
    an  EEA  national  whilst  he  was  in  Pakistan.   This  is  adversely
    determinative of the issue in respect of  both  'prior  household'  and
    'prior dependency' in Pakistan.

39.  The issue of 'prior household' in the UK does not arise.

40.  So far as the possibility of there having been a 'prior dependency'  in
    the UK is concerned, I find that there is nothing in the challenge that
    touches upon the Judge's clear and cogent findings in this regard.

41.  In all such circumstances I conclude that the Judge has  made  entirely
    sustainable and well-reasoned findings in respect of  prior  dependency
    in relation  to  the  Appellant's  circumstances  in  the  UK  -  which
    necessarily covers the period of time from 2014 until 2015, that is  to
    say the time from when Mr [A] acquired nationality of an EEA state  and
    his entry to the United Kingdom.  The Judge's decision  is  not  to  be
    impugned in this regard.

42.  In all the circumstances the decision  to  refuse  the  appeal  on  the
    basis that the Appellant had failed to demonstrate  that  he  satisfied
    the requirements of the Regulations was the right decision.  Insofar as
    there may have  been  an  error  of  law,  I  decline  to  exercise  my
    discretion to set aside the decision. Accordingly the decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal stands.

43.  For completeness I note  that  the  Appellant  submitted  a  bundle  of
    documents constituting what was said to be new evidence.  Mr Gajjar did
    not suggest that I should admit such evidence into the proceedings  for
    the purpose of consideration of 'error of law'.  Nonetheless there  was
    brief  discussion  of  the  contents  of  those  documents.   Mr  Avery
    suggested at one point that  the  reference  in  the  Appellant's  most
    recent witness statement  of  4  March  2019  to  not  having  provided
    adequate documentary evidence was an admission of the deficiency of the
    materials before the  First-tier  Tribunal.   Mr  Gajjar  appropriately
    pointed out that this particular passage in the witness  statement  was
    no more than  the  Appellant  summarising  the  basis  of  the  Judge's
    decision and was not an  acknowledgment  of  any  shortcomings  in  the
    evidence filed.

44.  However, one other observation that might be made  in  respect  of  the
    witness statement is that it appears to advance a set of  circumstances
    with regard to the situation in Pakistan that is  discrepant  with  the
    Appellant's oral testimony as recorded in the Decision  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal.  As I have  noted  above,  there  was  no  challenge  or
    suggestion in the grounds of appeal that the Judge had misunderstood or
    misrecorded the  Appellant's  testimony.   The  Judge  noted  that  the
    Appellant's oral evidence was to the effect that  his  own  mother  had
    requested he join Mr [A]'s household in Pakistan after Mr [A] had  left
    for Germany in order that  he  might  look  after  Mr  [A]'s  wife  and
    children (paragraph 13).  However, in the latest witness statement  the
    Appellant claims that he joined Mr [A]'s household  at  the  age  of  5
    having been adopted by  his  aunt.   It  might  be  thought  that  that
    constitutes at least a second version  of  events  -  if  not  a  third
    bearing in mind the contents of the application form denied that he had
    been a member of the household at all.

45.  Be that as it  may,  this  is  not  a  matter  that  has  informed  the
    consideration herein of 'error of law'.  I only mention  it  lest  this
    matter goes any further, or in the event that the  Appellant  might  be
    minded to make further applications or representations.  In any  event,
    this is a matter that relates to the circumstances  prior  to  the  EEA
    sponsor's acquisition of citizenship, and  so  on  my  reasoning  would
    ultimately be immaterial.



Notice of Decision

46.  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained no material error  of
    law and accordingly stands.

47.  The Appellant's appeal remains dismissed.

48.  No anonymity direction is sought or made.



The above represents a corrected transcript of ex tempore reasons  given  at
the conclusion of the hearing.
