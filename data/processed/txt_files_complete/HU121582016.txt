                      ERROR OF LAW FINDING AND REASONS


     1. The appellant appeals with  permission  a  decision  of  First-Tier
        Tribunal Judge Grant promulgated on the 18 February 2019  in  which
        the Judge dismissed the appellant's appeal on human rights grounds.






Background


     2. The appellant is a female citizen of India born on 10 April 1986.
     3. The Judge noted that the  issue  in  the  appeal  was  whether  the
        appellant used a proxy test taker  for  an  English  language  test
        required for an application for leave to remain as a student  at  a
        new college after the registration of the original college attended
        by the appellant was cancelled [6].
     4. The Judge sets out the correct legal self-direction at [7] that the
        burden of proof is upon the respondent to establish that fraud  has
        taken place whereupon the burden shifts to the appellant to give an
        innocent explanation.
     5. The respondent's refusal contained the following reasoning:

             "In your application dated 1 June 2012 you submitted  a  TOEIC
             certificate from New London College. ETS has a record of  your
             speaking test. Using voice verification software, ETS is  able
             to detect when a single person is undertaking multiple  tests.
             ETS undertook a check of your test and confirmed to  the  SSHD
             that there was significant  evidence  to  conclude  that  your
             certificate was fraudulently obtained by the use  of  a  proxy
             test taker. Your scores from the test taken on 19 May 2012  at
             New London College have now been counselled  by  ETS.  On  the
             basis of the information provided to her by ETS, the  SSHD  is
             satisfied that your certificate was fraudulently obtained  and
             that you used deception in your application of 1 June 2012."

     6. The Judge records at  [12]  that  the  appellant  accepted  in  her
        evidence that her speaking test in fact took place on 19 June 2012.
        The appellant agreed  in  her  oral  evidence  that  she  made  the
        application for further leave as her college closed  and  could  no
        longer sponsor her studies and that she did not know when her  Visa
        expired. The application was made on 1 June 2012 with the  speaking
        test that formed part of the  application  not  being  taken  until
        after that date and the TOEIC  certificate  being  submitted  later
        [14].
     7. The Judge finds at [26] what is described as an  obvious  error  in
        the refusal letter which has mis-typed the date of the  first  test
        is 19th May as the appellant did not sit any test on 19 May but sat
        the test marked as questionable by ETS on 16 May 2012 with the rest
        of the test, the second test, after making her application  to  the
        respondent on 19 June 2012; which has been marked invalid  by  ETS.
        The test results received by the  appellant,  before  the  concerns
        regarding the validity of the same was discovered,  resulted  in  a
        grant of leave on 24 August 2012.
     8. The Judge had the benefit of considering  evidence  from  Operation
        Faï¿½ade which showed for the period covering the dates the appellant
        took her test 74% of the tests taken at  New  London  College  were
        invalid and 26% were questionable; none  were  valid.  The  College
        directors  home  addresses  were  searched  on  17  June  2014  and
        documents seized showing candidates names and the name of  a  proxy
        taker referred to as a 'pilot'. It is now known that  directors  of
        the company together with invigilators and others were involved  in
        fraud  and  have  been  convicted  and  sentenced  to  periods   of
        imprisonment.
     9. The Judge found there was cogent evidence before the Tribunal  that
        neither of the tests allegedly taken by the appellant were taken by
        her.
    10. The Judge considered the explanation provided by the appellant  but
        found the appellant had not given a satisfactory explanation before
        the  Tribunal.  Accordingly  the  Judge  upheld   the   respondents
        contention the appellant was not entitled to leave to remain  as  a
        spouse under Appendix FM because she could not meet the suitability
        criteria of the Immigration Rules.
    11. Thereafter, the Judge considered paragraph  276ADE  and  article  8
        ECHR outside the Rules. The Judge gives reasons why  it  was  found
        the appellant was unable to succeed on either basis.
    12. The appellant sought  permission  to  appeal  which  was  initially
        refused by another judge of the First-Tier Tribunal but renewed  to
        the Upper Tribunal.
    13. The appellant asserts the Judge failed to address the  conflict  in
        the evidence at [12] indicating the speaking test  was  sat  on  19
        June 2012 yet at [17] the Judge records  the  appellant's  evidence
        that a speaking test was in fact sat on 19 May 2012,  not  19  June
        2012. The grounds assert the Judge was at least  required  to  take
        that into account when assessing the actual date  of  the  speaking
        test. The grounds also assert the Judge erred in  interpreting  the
        'Look-up tool'. The grounds assert the only element  of  the  TOEIC
        test being analysed is the speaking element therefore, as the  test
        of May 2012 is marked as questionable it had been analysed  as  the
        speaking test. The grounds assert the Judge has erred in failing to
        note that the 'Look-up tool' has ETS's  analysis  of  the  speaking
        scores. The grounds assert it is not disputed the May 2012 test was
        marked as questionable which is the same test referred  to  in  the
        respondent's refusal letter indicating there was no evidence before
        the Judge categorising the May 2012 test as  invalid.  It  is  also
        submitted the Judge failed to adequately reason why the test of  19
        June 2012, that is marked as invalid, which was then taken was that
        of the appellant. The grounds assert this would mean the  appellant
        had taken two different speaking tests which  has  never  been  the
        respondent's case. The grounds also assert the Judge  has  provided
        insufficient evidence for finding the appellant had not  raised  an
        innocent explanation and that the Judge's reasons for rejecting the
        explanation are inadequate. The grounds assert at  [29]  the  Judge
        has unreasonably speculated and asserts the Judge appears  to  have
        placed a significantly higher burden upon the appellant. There  are
        no adverse credibility findings  made  following  cross-examination
        which  coupled  with  the  generic  concerns  in  the  respondent's
        evidence are said to be sufficient to surpass the minimum level  of
        plausibility.
    14. Permission to appeal was granted by a judge of the  Upper  Tribunal
        in the following terms:

             "The grounds seeking permission to appeal take issue with  the
             First-Tier Tribunal decision paragraph 25. It is arguable that
             the First-Tier Tribunal  Judge  did  not  clarify  or  resolve
             whether the appellant had taken two tests or one test,  either
             of which were the subject of investigation. In the context  of
             the appellants evidence it is arguable this issue should  have
             been resolved."

    15. The respondent filed a Rule 24 response  dated  21  June  2019  the
        relevant part of which is in the following terms:

             "3.  The Judge of the first Tier was aware of the  nature  and
                  ambit of the appeal and the respondent will submit that it
                  is unfair to criticise the Judge for having any  confusion
                  in this regard. Looking at the determination holistically,
                  it is respectfully submitted that  these  grounds  do  not
                  disclose the material arguable error  of  law.  There  was
                  simply no basis, on the evidence  before  the  FTJ,  which
                  could or should have resulted in  a  materially  different
                  outcome to the Appellants appeal. The FTJ did make a clear
                  finding on whether the Appellant had sat the  second  test
                  as below.


                      [26] There is an obvious error in the refusal  letter
                      which has mistyped the date of the first test as 19th
                      May. The appellant did not sit any test on 19 May she
                      sat the test marked as questionable by ETS on 16  May
                      2012. She sat the rest of the test  the  second  test
                      after making an application to  the  respondent,  and
                      this was taken on 19 June 2012 and  has  been  marked
                      invalid by ETS. She has confirmed. In  evidence  that
                      she  supplied  the  second  test   results   to   the
                      respondent once she had received it from  New  London
                      College. It resulted in a grant of leave on 24 August
                      2012.


             4.   The respondent will submit that there  is  no  basis  for
                  interfering with the decision of the FTJ  to  dismiss  the
                  Appellant's appeal. It was properly open  to  the  FTJ  to
                  conclude that the Appellant had failed  to  discharge  the
                  burden of proof to provide an  innocent  excuse  regarding
                  the allegation of fraud. The grounds in effect  amount  to
                  no more than a disagreement with the  decision  which  the
                  Judge was entitled to make  based  upon  the  evidence  no
                  arguable errors of law capable of having a material impact
                  upon the outcome of the appeal."


Error of law


    16. The grant of permission refers to [25] which is  in  the  following
        terms:

             "25.     The look up tool extract shows the test taken  on  16
                  May 2012 by the appellant has been marked as  questionable
                  by ETS. The test taken on 19 June  2012  has  been  marked
                  invalid. It is common knowledge  that  all  TOEIC  testing
                  exercises  have  four  components  namely  listening   and
                  reading examined on the first test date and  speaking  and
                  writing examined on the second test date.   The  appellant
                  has stated in evidence that she did  the  tests  over  two
                  separate days and this is reflected in  the  ETS  look  up
                  tool record. ETS do not know the  appellant  and  have  no
                  reason to single her out. The only interest  ETS  have  is
                  ensuring the integrity of the examination system for which
                  ETS was responsible at the relevant time."

    17. Mr Raza sought to rely upon the grounds of  appeal.  He  submitted,
        inter alia, the Look-up tool indicated  one  set  of  results  were
        questionable and the other invalid but  fails  to  give  sufficient
        clarity to ascertain which test was affected.
    18. Mr Raza submitted that in [17] the Judge records the evidence given
        in re-examination in the following terms:

             "17.     In re-examination Counsel for the appellant asked her
                  if she had submitted a  certificate  for  a  speaking  and
                  writing test on 19 May which she confirmed. In response to
                  a further question from Mr Raza she confirmed this was the
                  only speaking test she did with ETS and that she  did  not
                  sit any test on 19 June 2012 at New London College."

    19. Mr Raza submitted the respondent did not say  what  date  the  test
        relied upon had taken place and that as the 19th May test was  only
        marked as "questionable" this was the  only  speaking  test  taken,
        meaning the Judge erred in concluding that the test  taken  in  May
        2012 was not the speaking test.
    20. Mr Raza submitted that findings by the Judge in the alternative are
        factually wrong and that the Judge found against the appellant on a
        different model as there was  no  evidence  regarding  the  use  of
        deception.
    21. Mr Raza also raised the issue of  lack  of  passport  number  being
        included in the Look-up tool results in support of  his  contention
        that there was no connection between the appellant and the  invalid
        result. It was accepted the appellant had taken an English language
        test but claimed only one was taken and that the second test  which
        was declared invalid is not that of the appellant.  The  respondent
        could not prove this was as there was no link to a passport in  the
        Look-up tool.
    22. It is clear that two tests were taken, one marked  as  questionable
        and one as invalid. Even though the appellant in re-examination  in
        answer to a question from Mr Raza claimed she did not sit a test on
        19 June at New London College the Judge was  clearly  satisfied  on
        the basis of the evidence that the appellant had sat a second  test
        on that date. Specific references made to  the  appellant's  answer
        agreeing that her speaking test took place on 19 June 2012 at  [12]
        where the Judge writes:

             "12.     She explained the test was in two  parts  taken  over
                  two separate days and the speaking and writing tests  were
                  done later on. The appellant agreed that the speaking test
                  took place on 19 June 2012."

        and at [14] where the Judge writes:

             "14. The appellant has agreed in her oral  evidence  that  she
                  made this application because her college a closed and  it
                  could no longer  sponsor  her  studies  and  she  said  in
                  evidence that she did not  know  when  her  Visa  expired.
                  Nevertheless she made her application on 1 June  2012  and
                  the speaking test part of the application  was  not  taken
                  until after that date and therefore the TOEIC  certificate
                  was submitted later."

    23. Any conflict arising from the evidence appears to be as a result of
        the appellant giving contradictory answers; unless  the  answer  to
        the question given in re-examination is specific  confirmation  the
        test of 19 June 2012 was not sat at New London College.
    24. In any event, the Judge was required to resolve any conflict in the
        evidence and did so. The Judge makes a clear finding at [25  -  26]
        that the appellant sat the second  test  on  19  June  2012,  which
        included the speaking element, which is that that has been found to
        be invalid by ETS.
    25. Mr Raza's claim there would never be two tests sat by  a  candidate
        is not made out  and  no  authority  for  such  a  proposition  was
        provided.  It is known ETS have three options when a  person  takes
        an English language test for which ETS are the body responsible for
        assessing whether that person has  obtained  the  required  minimum
        level and hence passed the test. The first option, if the  required
        standard has been obtained and ETS are  satisfied  the  person  who
        took the test is the person entitled to the certificate, is that  a
        pass mark is given, and  the  requisite  certificate  issued.  This
        appears to be what happened in the  appellant's  case  until  later
        examination of the June 2012 speaking test  resulted  in  the  same
        being declared invalid.
    26. A declaration a test score is invalid is the second option  if  the
        evidence before ETS shows substantial evidence of invalidity,  such
        as the use a proxy test taker.
    27. The third option is for the test result to be marked "questionable"
        as indicated in the Look-up tool results for the test taken in  May
        2012. This in that case the test is neither valid nor  invalid  and
        the respondent ordinarily approaches the test taker to seek further
        information or give them the opportunity to  retake  the  test.  In
        that scenario it is plausible that a person may take  two  speaking
        tests the first of which is declared questionable  and  the  second
        assessed fresh without reference to the original  test  result.  In
        such a scenario it is plausible that the appellant would have taken
        the speaking element both in the first test taken in May 2012  that
        was declared questionable and in the second test  on  the  19  June
        2012, as found by the Judge, which was declared invalid.
    28. It is not made out when assessing the merits  and  in  finding  the
        respondent  had  discharge  the  evidential  burden  and  that  the
        appellant had failed to provide a  satisfactory  explanation,  that
        the Judge failed to take all relevant matters into  account.  There
        is clear reference in the decision to the appellant's claim to have
        only taken one test but also the weight of  evidence  available  to
        the Judge, including the Operation Faï¿½ade  report,  which  supports
        the Judge's conclusion the respondent had discharged the evidential
        burden upon him and that the explanation provided by the  appellant
        was  not  satisfactory.  It  was  not  disputed  the  Look-up  Tool
        confirmed the second test is invalid.
    29. Mr Raza's submission regarding the passport does  not  assist.  The
        Judge finds the appellant took the second English language test  on
        19 June 2012 which she  herself,  in  one  part  of  the  evidence,
        accepted  she  had.  The  Judge  also  specifically  refers  to   a
        submission in identical terms having been made  before  the  First-
        Tier Tribunal  at  [21]  which  was  rejected  by  the  Judge  when
        considering the evidence in the round. There was no arguable  doubt
        in the Judge's mind that the Look-up tool refers to tests taken  by
        the appellant  which  has  not  been  shown  to  be  an  irrational
        conclusion on the facts.
    30. Before the  Upper  Tribunal  Mr  Raza  was  asked  whether  he  had
        certificates with  him  as  the  Look-  up  tool  clearly  contains
        certificate numbers which might have enabled him to establish  that
        the certificates numbers on the Look-up  tool  did  not  relate  to
        those held by the appellant, but no such evidence was  forthcoming.
        It was not irrational for the Judge to conclude  that  the  Look-up
        tool relates to the tests taken by the appellant.
    31. It must be remembered in this appeal that the Judge had the benefit
        of seeing and hearing oral evidence being given and formed  a  view
        of weigh to be given to the elements of that evidence. Such  weight
        was a matter for the Judge and has not been shown to be irrational.
    32. The only basis on which it would be arguably possible  to  find  in
        the appellant's favour, on the basis of Mr Raza's  submissions,  is
        if sustainable findings made by the Judge are ignored in favour  of
        an insufficiently supported assertion regarding the second test and
        that  the  answer  in   re-examination   should   be   treated   as
        determinative without considering the evidence as a whole.
    33. This is a carefully considered determination in which the Judge was
        aware of the need to grapple with competing arguments.  It  is  not
        made out the Judge's conclusions fall outside the  range  of  those
        reasonably available to the  Judge  on  the  evidence.  Whilst  the
        appellant disagrees with  the  Judge's  conclusions  she  fails  to
        establish arguable legal error material to the decision to  dismiss
        the appeal sufficient to warrant the Upper Tribunal interfering any
        further in this decision.

Decision

    34. There is no material error of law in the Immigration Judge's
        decision. The determination shall stand.

   Anonymity.


    35. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules
        2005.


I make no such order pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008.
