For the Appellant:           Ms Warren, Counsel instructed by Duncan Lewis
& Co
For the Respondent:    Mr Bates, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Ethiopia date  of  birth  20th  November
    1982.   He appeals with  permission  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge A Kelly) to dismiss his appeal on human rights grounds.


 2. The Appellant seeks leave to enter the United Kingdom for  the  purpose
    of settlement with his wife and three British children. I note  at  the
    outset that he made his application as long ago  as  the  18th  January
    2012. At the  time  that  he  made  his  application  his  wife  was  a
    recognised refugee. She is now naturalised as a British citizen.



    Error of Law

 3. The First-tier Tribunal decision is dated 17th  March  2017.  In  brief
    summary the appeal is dismissed on the grounds that the Appellant could
    not meet the requirements of paragraph 319L of the  Immigration  Rules,
    since he had not at the date of the Respondent's  decision  passed  the
    relevant English  language  test  or  demonstrated  that  he  would  be
    adequately maintained without recourse to public funds  if  he  entered
    the United Kingdom.  The Tribunal went on  to  dismiss  the  appeal  on
    Article 8 grounds on the basis that it could not be satisfied that  the
    Sponsor and Appellant were in a genuine  and  subsisting  relationship.
    The  existence  of  three  children  did  not  persuade  the   Tribunal
    otherwise: "no DNA evidence has been provided to  establish  this  even
    though the genuineness of the relationship was questioned by the  Entry
    Clearance Manager's review of the 23rd May 2015".

 4. This matter first came before me as on the 30th July 2018 when Mr Bates
    for the  Respondent  conceded  that  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal was flawed for material error of law. He invited me to set the
    decision aside in its entirety. The parties agreed that the  First-tier
    Tribunal had erred in fact, and in  raising  new  grounds  for  refusal
    without giving the Appellant an opportunity to respond:  in  particular
    there was no foundation for the Tribunal's finding that this was not  a
    genuine relationship. There never had been an Entry Clearance Manager's
    review in this case. The Respondent accepted that this  was  a  genuine
    and subsisting relationship and had never suggested otherwise.   If the
    Tribunal had any doubts about the sincerity of the  Sponsor's  evidence
    (and indeed that of the Appellant) Counsel  should  have  been  put  on
    notice of that fact. The Appellant was not given an opportunity address
    the Tribunal's concerns.  I agree that those cumulative errors are such
    that the decision must be set aside in its entirety, since I cannot  be
    satisfied that the erroneous findings on relationship  did  not  colour
    the Judge's findings on other matters in issue.


 5. I would add that  the  Tribunal  further  erred  in  directing  itself,
    insofar as the English Language test was concerned, that  the  relevant
    date for its enquiry was the date of the ECO's  decision.  This  was  a
    human rights appeal under  s82  of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002 as amended  by  the  Immigration  Act  2014.   As  such
    s85A(2) of the 2002 Act had no application, since it had been  repealed
    on the 20th October  2014:  the  Tribunal  was  therefore  tasked  with
    determining whether,  at  the  date  of  the  appeal  before  it,   the
    Appellant should be granted entry clearance on Article 8 grounds.  This
    error was material because at  the  date  of  the  ECO's  decision  the
    Appellant had not passed the relevant test, whereas by the date of  the
    appeal he had. Since there is no  temporal  requirement  in  the  rules
    itself (see below) this was a matter which should have been resolved in
    the Appellant's favour.




    The Decision Re-Made


 6. Unfortunately -  very  unfortunately  given  the  already  unacceptable
    delays in this case - I was not able to proceed to remake the  decision
    in the appeal on the 30th July 2018. The matter has come back before me
    today for remaking.  At the hearing I was assisted by submissions  from
    Mr Bates and Ms Warren, and at the close I indicated that I would allow
    the appeal. I now give my reasons.

 7. The salient facts are best set out in chronological terms:

    2005   The Sponsor (S) arrives in the United Kingdom and claims asylum


    26.4.07            S is granted  five  years'  leave  to  remain  as  a
    refugee


    2008         S travels to Ethiopia and is introduced to A


    12.6.09            The couple are married in Ethiopia


    July 09            A applies for entry clearance


    29.7.09            A is refused entry clearance on the  ground  that  S
    was under 21
                 pursuant to paragraph 277 of HC395


    19.9.09             A  starts  work  in  the  Addis  Ababa  branch   of
    'Mustaqbal United
                 Kingdom Ltd', a money-transfer business


    19.9.10            The couple's first child is born in Manchester


    9.1.12       A applies for entry clearance under paragraph 319L


    23.01.12           A refused entry clearance on the ground that S  only
    has
                 'discretionary leave'  and  so  is  not  settled  for  the
    purposes of the
                 Immigration Rules


    3.8.12       S granted Indefinite Leave to Remain as a refugee


    8.1.13       The Respondent concedes, at First-tier  Tribunal  hearing,
    that the
                 ground for refusal was wrong, because at date of  decision
           (the
                 then operative date for determination of the appeal) S
                 was a refugee and so entitled to sponsor her husband's
                 application for entry clearance. The decision is withdrawn
    and
                 Tribunal is rendered functus officio


    31.1.14            Couple's second child is born in Manchester


    Feb 2014     S granted British nationality


    4.11.15            A is served with a  fresh  refusal  (dated  8.1.13).
    Reasons given are
                 that A has not passed his English Language test, nor
                 demonstrated that he will be maintained  without  recourse
    to
                 public funds


    9.6.16       A passes requisite English Language test


    29.3.15            Couple's third child is born in Manchester


    14.3.17            First-tier Tribunal Judge Kelly dismisses A's appeal


 8. The parties agree that the legal framework for the proper determination
    of this  appeal  is  as  follows.  Paragraph  317L,  the  part  of  the
    Immigration Rules relied upon  by  the  Appellant,  is  deemed  by  the
    Respondent to be a 'human  rights  claim'[1].   The  Appellant  further
    asserts that he wishes to be  reunited  with  his  family.  The  appeal
    before me is therefore a 'human rights appeal' and as such the relevant
    date for my enquiry is the date of today's hearing[2].    I must  first
    determine whether or not the Appellant qualifies  for  leave  to  enter
    under any relevant 'human rights' provision of the  Immigration  Rules,
    and if he does not, determine whether the decision to refuse  to  grant
    him entry clearance amounts to a disproportionate interference with, or
    lack of respect for, his Article 8 family life.








    The Immigration Rules


 9. I start then with the rule. Paragraph 319L reads:


         319L. The requirements to be met by a person seeking leave to enter
         the United Kingdom as the spouse or civil partner of a person with
         limited leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom as a refugee
         or beneficiary of humanitarian protection, are that:
         (i) (a) the applicant is married to or the civil partner of a
         person who has limited leave to enter or remain in the United
         Kingdom as a refugee or beneficiary of humanitarian protection
         granted such status under the immigration rules and the parties are
         married or have formed a civil partnership after the person granted
         asylum or humanitarian protection left the country of his former
         habitual residence in order to seek asylum or humanitarian
         protection; and
         (b) the applicant provides an original English language test
         certificate in speaking and listening from an English language test
         provider approved by the Secretary of State for these purposes,
         which clearly shows the applicant's name and the qualification
         obtained (which must meet or exceed level A1 of the Common European
         Framework of Reference)...
         (ii) the parties to the marriage or civil partnership have met; and
         (iii) each of the parties intends to live permanently with the
         other as his or her spouse or civil partner and the marriage or
         civil partnership is subsisting; and
         (iv) there will be adequate accommodation for the parties and any
         dependants without recourse to public funds in accommodation which
         they own or occupy exclusively; and
         (v) the parties will be able to maintain themselves and any
         dependants adequately without recourse to public funds; and
         (vi) the applicant holds a valid United Kingdom entry clearance for
         entry in this capacity.


10. I note that paragraph 319L,  unlike  other  parts  of  the  Immigration
    Rules, contains  no  temporal  restriction  on  when  the  requirements
    therein must be met. There  is,  for  instance,  no  reference  in  the
    opening  sentence  to  requirements  being  met   "at   the   date   of
    application".  The   provisions   in   respect   of   maintenance   and
    accommodation  are   forward   looking:   "there   will   be   adequate
    accommodation",  "the  parties  will  be  able...".    I  am  therefore
    satisfied  that  if  the  Appellant  can  show,  on  the   balance   of
    probabilities, that he meets all of the substantive requirements of the
    rule today (ie all but sub-paragraph (vi)) his appeal would fall to  be
    allowed on human rights grounds, since the Respondent  could  not  show
    the decision to maintain refusal to be proportionate.


11. Mr Bates submits that the Appellant today falls at  the  first  hurdle,
    since his wife is no longer in possession of limited leave to remain as
    a refugee: she is British.   That is correct. I have before me  a  copy
    of S's British passport showing it to have  been  issued  on  the  21st
    April 2014. Pursuant to the decision in ZN (Afghanistan) v Secretary of
    State for the Home Department [2010] UKSC 21 the fact that  she  was  a
    refugee is of no assistance to the Appellant  today.  The  requirements
    relating to  refugee  family  reunion  are  less  exacting  than  those
    relating  to  British  nationals  for  good  reason:  refugees   cannot
    reasonably be expected to immediately meet, for instance,  the  minimum
    income requirement set out in Appendix  FM  (at  E-LTRP.3.1.),  whereas
    persons who have been here long enough to acquire  British  nationality
    can.  It is for that good, and proportionate,  reason  that  the  rules
    differentiate between different  classes  of  sponsor.   The  Appellant
    cannot, as of today's hearing, show that he meets the  requirements  of
    319L(i)(a).

12. As to the second requirement, Mr Bates confirmed that the  test  taken,
    and passed by the Appellant on the 9th June 2016, is of  the  requisite
    standard, and that it was administrated by an approved  provider  under
    Appendix O of the Immigration Rules. As I note above, at  the  date  of
    the appeal before  Judge  Kelly,  this  certificate  was  determinative
    evidence  that  the  Appellant  met  the  requirements   of   paragraph
    319L(i)(b) as of that date. However the passing of time means that this
    certificate is no longer valid. Appendix O of the rules  provides  that
    such a certificate is only considered valid for two years from the date
    of issue. The certificate therefore expired in June of this year, and I
    am unable to find that the Appellant  meets  this  requirement,  albeit
    that he did so for the two year period in  which  the  certificate  was
    valid.

13. Mr Bates accepts that the requirements of 319L(iii) and (iv)  are  met:
    the parties have met  in  person,  intend  to  live  together  and  the
    marriage is genuine and subsisting.   It is further accepted that since
    the Appellant will be sharing a room with his wife, the requirements of
    319L(v) in respect of accommodation are also met: I note that the  file
    contains a letter from S's  landlord,  City  South  Manchester  Housing
    Trust, confirming that they consent to the Appellant joining his family
    and that this would not  result  in  any  overcrowding  in  this  three
    bedroom home.

14. As to maintenance, Mr Bates made no such concession but invited  me  to
    assess the evidence before me on the balance  of  probabilities.   That
    evidence indicates that the Appellant has worked for  the  same  money-
    transfer business since September 2009. The company is called Mustaqbal
    UK Ltd. He works in their Addis Ababa office.  In  his  letter  of  the
    13th February 2017 Mr  Mohamed  Adan,  Director  of  Mustaqbal  UK  Ltd
    confirms that his offer, originally made in 2015, holds good: he  would
    like to offer the Appellant a role in the company headquarters  in  the
    United Kingdom, and does so because of the Appellant's proven "ability,
    knowledge, responsibility, loyalty and  determination".   I  have  also
    been provided with  numerous  money  transfer  receipts  and  S's  bank
    statements, which support the evidence offered by Appellant  and  S  to
    the effect that he has been supporting his family in  this  country  by
    sending them money from Ethiopia  on  a  regular  basis.   As  of  16th
    November 2015  he  held  315,999  Ethiopian  Birr  in  savings  in  the
    Construction and Business Bank in Dire Dawa (on that date this  equated
    to approximately �10,886), and a further Birr  80,000  in  the  Wegagen
    Bank (�2440). I do not have  any  contemporaneous  evidence  about  the
    current level of savings held by the Appellant but I do  note  a  later
    statement, issued by the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia in  February  2017
    closes with a balance of Birr 131,132 (�4581.07). Whatever his  current
    balance shows, I am satisfied that the evidence as whole indicates that
    a) the Appellant has been employed since 2009 by Mustaqbal UK Ltd b) he
    has earned enough money to be able to send money to his family here and
    c) has also managed to save significant sums  during  that  period.   I
    place considerable weight on those factors in evaluating whether it  is
    more likely than not that the Appellant will be able to find employment
    when he comes to the United Kingdom. I am prepared to so  find.  Before
    me the Respondent made  no  specific  criticism  of  the  letters  from
    Mustaqbal UK Ltd  and  given  the  remaining  evidence  I  see  nothing
    inherently incredible or suspect in their indication that they would be
    willing to transfer the Appellant's role to one of their United Kingdom
    offices. In  making  this  assessment  I  have  taken  account  of  the
    Appellant's long experience with the company,  and  the  fact  that  he
    holds a number of qualifications, including an 'A' grade in the English
    language at 'General Secondary Education' level, and  various  diplomas
    including in IT skills.


15. The relevant provision of the rule relates only to maintenance  of  the
    Appellant himself: the rule contains no Appendix FM-style  requirements
    as to household income and Mr Bates  agreed  that  as  the  mother  and
    children are British they have their own entitlements to state support.
    I am satisfied that if the Appellant has been earning enough  in  Addis
    to support himself, his family in the United Kingdom and save,  on  the
    balance of probabilities it is likely that he will earn enough here  to
    be able to "adequately" maintain himself, that is  to  say  his  income
    will be greater than what his notional  entitlement  would  be  to  any
    state benefits.  I find that the requirements of 319L(v) would be met.

16. The Appellant has not been able to demonstrate that he meets all of the
    requirements of the rule, in particular those  at  319L(i).  He  cannot
    therefore succeed on 'human  rights  grounds'  with  reference  to  the
    rules.



    Article 8

17. Mr Bates accepts that the Appellant enjoys a family life with his  wife
    and children.   Since their marriage the Appellant and  his  wife  have
    maintained regular contact by telephone  and  other  'modern  means  of
    communication' such as internet-based video chats. The eldest child has
    been to Ethiopia to see his father on  two  occasions,  staying  for  2
    months in 2013 and with his siblings,  6  weeks  in  2017.  Like  their
    mother the children see the Appellant over 'video-chat' and speak  with
    him by telephone. A letter  from  the  eldest  child's  primary  school
    confirms that he speaks about his father  at  school,  and  offers  the
    collective opinion of teacher, classroom assistant and headteacher that
    it would be beneficial for him if his parents were to be  reunited.   I
    am satisfied, having regard to the relatively low standard required  to
    engage Article 8, that the decision to refuse entry  clearance  amounts
    to an interference - or lack of respect - such that the rights  are  in
    play.


18. Ms Warren accepted that the Respondent's  position  of  refusing  entry
    clearance to persons who do not qualify for leave to  enter  under  the
    Rules is rationally connected to the Article 8(2) aim of protecting the
    economy.

19. In my assessment of proportionality I must have regard  to  the  public
    interest in the maintenance of immigration  control,  and  I  recognise
    that the rules are framed to properly 'strike the balance' between  the
    rights of those already in the United Kingdom with those who would seek
    to come here. I bear in mind that it is in  the  public  interest  that
    persons who seek to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  are  financially
    independent and able to speak English, since such  persons  are  better
    able to integrate. In this case I am satisfied, for the reasons set out
    at  �14-15,  that  the  Appellant  is  financially  independent.  I  am
    satisfied that he and his family will not have any additional  recourse
    to public funds, should he come to this country: Rhuppiah  v  Secretary
    of State for the Home Department [2018] UKSC 58. I am further satisfied
    that the Appellant is able to speak English. Although  his  certificate
    has officially 'expired'  I  note  that  the  bundle  contains  various
    certificates in English language instruction dating from 2003 (when the
    Appellant achieved an 'A' grade at the equivalent of GCSE) to 2016,  as
    well as other diplomas in inter alia marketing, management and IT,  all
    apparently taught  in  English.  On  the  balance  of  probabilities  I
    consider it unlikely that he will have forgotten English if he has been
    able to speak it, to the basic level required, for  some  15  years.  I
    note that these factors cannot weigh in his favour:    it simply  means
    that I do not have to weigh these matters against him  in  the  overall
    balancing exercise.

20. I turn now to the reasons advanced by Ms Warren as to why, in the  very
    particular circumstances of the case, the decision to refuse  entry  is
    disproportionate, notwithstanding the Appellant's failure to  meet  the
    requirement of the rules.

21. This is a man who has been seeking entry clearance to join his wife  in
    this country for nine years. He was refused entry clearance in 2009  on
    - as far as I am aware - the sole  ground  that  at  the  date  of  the
    application the S was not yet 21 years  old.  The  rule  that  mandated
    refusal in those circumstances was subsequently struck from HC395 after
    the Supreme Court held the imposition of such a minimum age limit to be
    unlawful: Quila & Anr v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home  Department
    [2011] UKSC 45.  Had the opinion of the Supreme Court been available to
    the decision maker at that time there is every reason to  believe  that
    entry clearance would in fact have been granted.     In 2012  a  second
    refusal decision was premised on the  sole  reason  that  S  could  not
    sponsor the application because she had only discretionary leave.  That
    was, as the Respondent now fully accepts, an error of  fact.  S  was  a
    recognised refugee at the relevant time.  The  S  and  the  Appellant's
    representatives therefore headed towards his appeal hearing in  January
    2013 with high confidence, only to be stymied at the door of the  court
    when the ECO, recognising the error, withdrew the decision.  This  left
    the Tribunal, and the Appellant,  without  any  power  to  address  the
    decision.   There is  every  reason  to  believe  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal would have allowed that appeal that day, since the only matter
    in issue had to be resolved in the Appellant's favour.


22. By the time that the fresh refusal  decision  was  served  on  the  4th
    November 2015 the legal - and factual  -  landscape  had  changed.  The
    Appellant now had to pass a specified English language  test,  and  his
    wife had naturalised as a British citizen.  As  can  be  seen  from  my
    decision above, it is these factors which defeat the Applicant's  claim
    under the rules.  I recognise that failure to be a matter  to  which  I
    must attach significant weight in the balancing exercise.

23. There is however one other factual development  which  I  am  bound  to
    treat as a primary consideration. The Appellant is now father to  three
    British children, all of whom are growing  up  without  him.  Mr  Bates
    accepted without hesitation that it would be in their best interests to
    live with both their parents and I find  that  that  was  a  concession
    properly made.   I have before me a statement sworn on the  13th  April
    2017 by S's sister in the United Kingdom,  a  Ms  [LM].  Ms  [M]  makes
    various observations about the way that this case has been  dealt  with
    over the years but for the  purpose  of  this  decision,  the  relevant
    section of her statement relates to how her sister and her children are
    coping without the Appellant: "desperate" and "struggling" sum  it  up.
    The Appellant, for his part unsurprisingly states, in his statement  of
    the 13th February 2017, that he misses his family enormously.  He  just
    wants to be granted entry clearance so  that  he  can  work  to  better
    support his family, and live a normal life with his wife and  children.



24. In his submissions Mr Bates asked me to note that  this  'family  life'
    has, since its inception', always been enjoyed the  way  it  is  today.
    Wife  and  husband  married  knowing  that  they  lived  in   different
    countries. They decided to have children knowing that he was  still  in
    Ethiopia. The children have never known any different: their father has
    always been a distant figure at the end of a phone line.   He  accepted
    that this was not a matter logically capable of going  to  whether  the
    decision in fact betrayed a 'lack of respect' for this family life (the
    first Razgar question): such a submission would  be  inconsistent  with
    the fact that parliament has specifically identified Article 8  as  the
    sole ground of  appeal  in  entry  clearance  cases.  Rather  Mr  Bates
    submitted that it was a factor to be taken into  account  in  measuring
    the impact of continued separation on the individual family members: it
    was therefore relevant to the question of proportionality.

25. I have given that  matter  careful  consideration.  I  am  nevertheless
    satisfied that I must place substantial weight on the best interests of
    the children. The reality is that these British children have been born
    and grown up here. Their home, school  and  friends  are  here.  It  is
    inconceivable to S  that  she  would  uproot  the  children  from  this
    security to move to Ethiopia (assuming she would be given entry to that
    country).   The decision in this appeal means  that  they  will  either
    grow up with their father, or without him.  The family did  not  simply
    'choose' to live separately. The Appellant  made  his  application  for
    entry clearance as long ago as 2009, and has been doggedly pursuing his
    case since then. As the peculiar history of this case demonstrates, the
    Appellant has twice lost out, though no fault of his  own,  to  factors
    beyond his control. The factors I have identified at �21  above  cannot
    be characterised as 'near misses': it is more that  the  Appellant  hit
    the target but was denied his prize.  Today his claim under  the  Rules
    is defeated, in essence, by the fact that his wife  further  integrated
    herself in the United Kingdom by claiming the nationality to which  she
    was entitled (I say this, I  recognise,  assuming  that  the  Appellant
    could, if there were utility in him so doing, be able  to  provide  yet
    another English Language test certificate to go with his collection  in
    the bundle).  Against that background I am satisfied that it  would  be
    wholly disproportionate to expect the Appellant to re-take his test and
    make yet another application for entry clearance.  Even  assuming  that
    there was a provision under the Rules under which he could make such an
    application[3] it would mean yet further delay and more time  that  the
    children would be separated from their father -  separation  which  the
    Respondent properly recognises to be contrary to their best interests.


26. Having considered all of the factors identified above, and  recognising
    the   weight to be attached to public interest in refusing persons  who
    cannot meet the requirements of the rules, I am satisfied that  on  the
    particular facts of this unusual case it would be  disproportionate  to
    deny the Appellant entry clearance as a spouse. I therefore  allow  the
    appeal on human rights grounds.


    Decision


27. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains  errors  of  law  such
    that the decision is set aside.


28. The decision in the appeal is remade as follows: "the appeal is allowed
    on human rights grounds".

29. There is no order for anonymity.






                                                  Upper Tribunal Judge Bruce
                                                          19th November 2018


                           -----------------------
[1] "The applications listed in this section and made under the Immigration
Rules are human rights applications and the starting position is that there
is a right of appeal against refusal. The relevant applications are those
made under...part 8 of these Rules (family members) where... the sponsor is
present and settled in the UK or has refugee or humanitarian protection in
the United Kingdom" from the Respondent's published policy document Rights
of Appeal version 7.0
[2] This appeal has proceeded, since the day it was lodged in the First-
tier Tribunal, on the basis that the refusal decision was not served upon
the Appellant until the 4.11.15. A decision takes effect on the day upon
which it was served: R (on the application of Anufrijeva) v Secretary of
State for the Home Department [2003] UKHL 36.



[3] Mr Bates was unable to identify any provision which might be
applicable. I note that paragraph E-ECP.3.2 of Appendix FM sets out the
types of income that may be taken into account in determining whether an
applicant can meet the 'minimum income requirement' of �18,600. It does not
include the overseas earnings of the applicant.  Since S is primary carer
to three young children, and there is no prospect of her being able to earn
that money, it is difficult to see how the Appellant could now succeed
under the rules.
