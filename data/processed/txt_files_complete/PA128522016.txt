Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr R Henry Ti (Solicitor)
For the Respondent:    Mr T Wilding (Senior HOPO)


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Albania. He appealed to the First-
    tier Tribunal, against the decision of the  Respondent,  taken  on  8th
    June 2016, to reject his application for refugee  asylum  status  under
    the United Kingdom's obligations given the Refugee Convention, and  the
    European Convention on Human Rights.

 2. The Appellant's appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Mayall at
    Hatton  Cross  on  22nd  December  2016.   In  paragraph  64   of   his
    determination, the judge said this:-

         "Taking all of the matters above cumulatively I regret  that,  even
         applying the lower standard of proof set out above, i.e. that of  a
         real risk, I do not accept his claim that he had been threatened by
         persons whom his father had arrested, associates of  such  persons.
         I do not accept that he had been threatened by any organised  crime
         gang.  It follows that, if indeed he was threatened at all, he  has
         not disclosed any evidence suggesting who it  was  that  threatened
         him."

 3. In the Grounds of Appeal, it is suggested that such  a  conclusion  was
    irrational because the judge had  earlier  at  paragraph  58  expressly
    recorded that,

         "It is however abundantly clear from the documents, that the  first
         incident (the threatening with the axe) occurred during his  normal
         duties as a police officer.  According to his own report, and  that
         in the newspaper, he just happened by chance upon his assailant who
         proceeded to threaten him" (paragraph 58).

    The grounds to the Upper Tribunal also draw attention  to  the  Shekuli
    Panorama newspaper article which confirms reports of the attack.

 4. At the hearing before me, Mr Wilding, appearing as Senior  Home  Office
    Presenting Officer, on behalf of the  Respondent  Secretary  of  State,
    accepted that the nature of the attack made on the Appellant's  father,
    the targeting of his children, and the source of the  threats  made  to
    him had all been misinterpreted and misunderstood  by  the  judge,  and
    that there was a clear error of law, such that  no  findings  could  be
    preserved, and the matter had to be remitted  back  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal to be heard by a judge other than Judge Mayall.

My Consideration of Appeal

 5. A large part of the Appellant's claim is that he is  subjected  to  the
    "Kanun" in Albania.  At question 100 of his interview, when asked  what
    made him leave Albania, he had answered, "the  Kanun  says  up  to  17�
    years then after that anything can happen up to the killing.  They were
    using me to threaten me and my brother day after day,  that  my  father
    should stop chasing them".

 6. In relation to this, the judge  had  stated  at  paragraph  62  of  the
    determination that,

         "The Appellant's claim that he had been targeted since the  age  of
         12 years, was not credible, given that, even in his  own  evidence,
         at interview, he had said  that  traditionally,  under  Kanun  law,
         young males under the age of  17�  were  not  targeted  I  find  it
         surprising to say the least, that these criminals will be targeting
         such a young child."

 7. It is clear from what the Appellant said at question 100, however, that
    he had not at all indicated that young males under the age of 17�  were
    not targeted for harassment, for threats, or mild physical assaults.

 8. Moreover, in EH (Blood feuds) Albania CG [2012] UKUT 00348 it is  clear
    that children may well be subjected to ill-treatment in other ways.

 9. I have concluded that the  determination  cannot  stand  and  that  the
    appeal should be  remitted  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  hearing
    afresh.  It may well be that another  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  will
    reach a similar conclusion, but before doing so they will need to  make
    clear findings, and not misdirect  themselves  on  the  evidence,  with
    respect to the Appellant's circumstances, as well as to the case law.

10. The matter is remitted for a hearing afresh by a judge other than First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Mayall.

11. This appeal is allowed to the extent that it is remitted  back  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

12. An anonymity direction is made.



Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
