                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant, Xiumei Lin, born on 26 October 1977 is a female  citizen
    of China.  It is accepted that she is the wife of  a  British  citizen,
    Zhongqun Shi (the sponsor).  She applied for  entry  clearance  to  the
    United Kingdom as the sponsor's partner under Appendix FM of HC 395 (as
    amended).  By a decision dated 10 April 2014,  she  was  refused  entry
    clearance by the Entry Clearance Officer (Beijing) under  Section  EC-P
    of Appendix FM.  The appellant  appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge Morris) which considered the appeal on the papers and without  a
    hearing.  That appeal was dismissed in a  decision  promulgated  on  26
    March 2015.  The appellant now appeals, with permission, to  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 2. The application was refused under paragraph  EC-P1.1(c)  on  the  basis
    that a deposit certificate from the Bank of  China  provided  with  the
    application was not a genuine document.  There was no refusal of  entry
    clearance under paragraph 320.  The judge noted that the appellant  had
    remained living in Japan for seven years without permission  to  be  in
    that country and took that fact into account, as had  the  ECO  in  the
    original refusal.  In light  of  what  appeared  to  be  an  unreliable
    deposit certificate, the judge found that the appellant and sponsor did
    not meet the savings requirements (�62,500) nor the income  requirement
    (�18,600 per annum) provided for by Appendix FM.   The  judge  observed
    [18] that the burden of proof in the appeal was on the  appellant  save
    in relation to the allegations regarding the deposit certificate.   The
    judge was satisfied that the deposit  certificate  was  not  a  genuine
    document.  He relied upon a document verification report  (DVR).   This
    document is the product of enquiries made of a Ms Zhea, an  officer  of
    the Bank of China, Fuqing Branch.  Ms Zhea confirmed that the  sums  of
    money  which  the  deposit  certificate  indicated  were  held  in  the
    appellant's name did indeed "match those in [Bank of China's]  system."
    However, security features were not evident such as a  UV  reaction  to
    the "Bank of China" heading and logo  and  the  serial  number  on  the
    document should have been in relief.

 3. The appellant has pointed out that, in Counsel's skeleton  argument  to
    the First-tier Tribunal, it had been clearly submitted that the copy of
    the bank document which had been sent by the respondent to the Bank  of
    China was a scanned  copy  and  not  the  original  document.   In  the
    circumstances, it was hardly surprising that a scanned document did not
    reveal a watermark under UV light or, indeed, bear a serial  number  in
    relief.  Judge Morris states [18] he had taken fully into  account  the
    "forceful submissions" made by the appellant in the  skeleton  argument
    of her representatives but, apparently for the same reasons provided in
    the DVR, found the document to be false.  I find  that  the  judge  has
    failed to engage  properly  with  the  arguments  put  forward  by  the
    appellant.  In essence, the appellant argued that the  observations  of
    the Bank  of  China  official  were  entirely  accurate  but  were  not
    surprising given that the document that she had been asked to  consider
    was not an original but a photocopy of an original.  Significantly, the
    sums of money which the certificate indicated were in  the  appellant's
    account were confirmed by the Bank of China.  I  find  that  the  judge
    should have engaged properly  with  these  submissions  although  I  do
    acknowledge that this can be difficult when an appeal is decided on the
    papers without a hearing.  The judge has simply not  engaged  with  the
    appellant's arguments but has assumed [20] that the document was  false
    and that this fact (as  he  found  it)  coupled  with  the  appellant's
    immigration problems in Japan led him to  find  that  the  relationship
    between the appellant and sponsor was not genuine  or  subsisting.  The
    judge was in no position, in the light of the appellant's  submissions,
    simply to assume that the  document  submitted  by  the  appellant  was
    false.  He should have engaged with the acknowledged fact that it was a
    photocopy and not an original.  Under the circumstances,  I  set  aside
    the First-tier Tribunal decision and have re-made the decision.

 4. Having considered the documents in the respondent's bundle, it is clear
    that the  deposit  certificate  was  a  scanned  and  not  an  original
    document.  Applying the standard of the  balance  of  probabilities,  I
    find that the DVR does not undermine the  appellant's  contention  that
    the deposit certificate is a genuine document; the reasons outlined  in
    the DVR which led the ECO to reject the genuineness of the document can
    be explained by the reason of the fact that the document considered  by
    the Bank of China was not an original document.  As I have said, it  is
    particularly significant that the Bank did not dispute the  appellant's
    claimed deposit holdings; had that not been the case,  the  appellant's
    submission that the  deposit  certificate  was  a  copy  may  not  have
    assisted her at all.  If one accepts that the  deposit  certificate  is
    genuine, it is clear that the  savings  threshold  required  under  the
    Immigration Rules has been met by the  appellant.   The  birth  of  the
    appellant's and sponsor's child obviously postdates the ECO's  decision
    but, considering the evidence which  was  before  the  ECO  and  having
    proper regard  to  the  immigration  difficulties  encountered  by  the
    appellant in Japan, I find that the appellant and sponsor have been and
    continue to be engaged in a genuine  and  subsisting  relationship  and
    that they intend to live permanently together in  the  United  Kingdom.
    In the light of that finding, together with my finding as  regards  the
    financial requirements, I have re-made the  decision  by  allowing  the
    appeal against the ECO's decision dated 10 April 2014.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal promulgated on 26 March 2015 is  set
aside.  None of the findings of  fact  shall  stand.   I  have  re-made  the
decision  in  the  Upper  Tribunal.   The  appellant's  appeal  against  the
decision of the Entry Clearance Officer  dated  10  April  2014  is  allowed
under the Immigration Rules.

No anonymity direction is made.
