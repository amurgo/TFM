Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Forrest, instructed by Maguire Solicitors.
For the Respondent:    Mr Govan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a national of Turkey.  He appealed to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal against the refusal of the respondent on 16 May 2018 to  grant
    him protection under the Refugee Convention or the European  Convention
    on Human Rights.  His wife and two daughters  are  dependent  upon  his
    claim (he has another daughter still in Turkey).

 2. Judge Agnew dismissed his appeal.  He now appeals, with permission,  to
    this Tribunal.

 3. The basis of the appellant's claim is that he is a Kurdish  Alevi,  who
    after working in a number of places as a chef became Head Chef  of  the
    Sirincan restaurant, a famous restaurant in Izmir, some time apparently
    during 2016.  At least one of the owners of that restaurant, Mr Simsek,
    was thought to have been financing an organisation called  FETO.   That
    is the Turkish government's name, Fethullahist Terror Organisation, for
    an opposition movement inspired by the religious teachings of Fethullah
    Gï¿½len.  There was an attempted coup, thought to have been  inspired  by
    FETO, on 15 July 2016.  Apparently as a  result,  the  restaurant  came
    under suspicion. According to the appellant the restaurant was  run  by
    two senior members of FETO and they  were  currently  in  prison.   The
    appellant himself said that he was  detained  three  times  within  the
    space of two weeks, some two months after the coup.  He was beaten  and
    released only on condition he did not leave his house, and was told  to
    collect information for the authorities.  The  appellant  also  claimed
    that his wife had been sexually assaulted  by  three  people  whom  she
    believed to be policeman.   She  attributed  her  difficulties  to  her
    husband's link with the restaurant.  The appellant claimed  that  these
    events had caused him to leave Turkey.  He said that he had paid agents
    to arrange the departure of his wife and children,  and  then  himself.
    He said that he had arrived in the United  Kingdom  from  Turkey  on  5
    October 2017.

 4. At the hearing before Judge Agnew the appellant gave oral evidence.  He
    was cross-examined and further questions were asked by the judge.   His
    wife did not give oral evidence.  There  was  a  written  statement  by
    Professor W. Bowring which confirmed the  existence  and  fame  of  the
    restaurant,  and  gave  various  other  details  about  it.   Professor
    Bowring's statement also confirmed that  the  restaurant  was  seen  as
    linked with FETO.  Professor Bowring also  gave  some  details  of  the
    Turkish government's activities against FETO and made a number of other
    comments, including pointing out that those who had  been  arrested  or
    detained in the clampdown after 15 July 2015 might not have  been  very
    ready to talk about their experiences to others.

 5. The judge considered the evidence before her in a decision  running  to
    72 paragraphs.  She decided that the appellant's evidence was not to be
    believed.  He was vague and contradictory about almost all the dates of
    important events.  He could give no clear indication of when he started
    work at the restaurant, nor of when he stopped working there.  He could
    refer to  the  dates  of  his  detentions  and  ill-treatment  only  by
    reference to 16th July 2016.  He gave  names  for  the  owners  of  the
    restaurant which were different from those given by  Professor  Bowring
    in his expertise.    He  appeared  to  know  nothing  about  the  other
    personnel at the restaurant, despite claiming to be  Head  Chef  there.
    He was not aware of which of the owners of the restaurant, or how  many
    of them,  had  been  arrested  or  imprisoned.   He  could  provide  no
    explanation of why if he was troubled by being detained he had not left
    his employment at the restaurant and gone elsewhere; and there  was  no
    indication of any interest in him after the autumn of 2016, even though
    he had remained in Turkey, and apparently in Izmir, for  another  year.
    That there was no interest in him appeared to be confirmed by the  fact
    that he had left on his own passport.  His accounts of how he left were
    also contradictory: first he said he  paid  agents,  then  he  said  he
    transferred a car and a house to them.

 6. Because the judge did not consider the evidence was, or might  be,  the
    truth, she dismissed the appeals.  The grounds of appeal, in full, read
    as follows:

         "PARAGRAPH 33

         At the hearing  or  the  interview  the  appellant  was  not  asked
         specific dates of detention and  hence  this  information  was  not
         forthcoming.  Therefore to come to adverse conclusion was an  error
         in law.

         PARAGRAPH 41

         The 2 names given by the expert were not known and the Tribunal had
         the benefit of having the employment contract.  Even if the  owners
         have changed that  may  be  the  case  now  compared  to  when  the
         appellant was in Turkey.

         PARAGRAPH 45

         The IJ erred in law because it is not possible to know who else was
         arrested or not.

         PARAGRAPH 61

         The IJ erred here because the appellant had  said  that  the  deeds
         were transferred to the relevant parties."

 7. Permission was given by Judge Shaerf in a decision running to nearly  a
    full page, which expands on the grounds and explains why  it  might  be
    thought that the judge had misinterpreted or  misapplied  the  evidence
    before her.  Before us, Mr Forrest expanded on the grounds.

 8. We have considered the evidence with care,  and  in  the  light  of  Mr
    Forrest's submissions.   It seems to us that there is not the slightest
    reason to suppose that the appellant was telling the  truth  about  his
    experiences.  There is no doubt that the restaurant exists, nor, in the
    circumstances, is there much doubt that its Head Chef would  have  been
    of interest to the authorities.  The question is whether the  appellant
    had anything to do with the restaurant.   As the judge noted, there are
    numerous reasons to propose that he did not stop.

 9. Contrary to what has been asserted in the grounds, there was and is  no
    contract of employment in evidence.  The truth of the  matter  is  that
    although the appellant  knew  the  name  of  the  owner  who  had  been
    mentioned in press reports, he did not know the names of the other  two
    owners of the restaurant.  Indeed he claimed that they were  two  other
    people altogether.  Next, although he  claimed  to  be  Head  Chef,  he
    claimed also to be unaware of whether there had been any absences  from
    work that might be attributable  to  arrests  following  the  attempted
    coup.  Thirdly, he could, as we  have  already  noted,  give  no  clear
    evidence of when it  was  that  he  claimed  to  have  worked  for  the
    restaurant.  The judge noted that all he was able to say  in  terms  of
    the dates of his employment or his detentions was  that  they  were  so
    many months or weeks before or after 16 July 2016.

10. It seems to us in  the  highest  degree  likely  that  the  appellant's
    knowledge of the restaurant was limited to what  he  had  read  in  the
    press, and that that was why he was unable to expand with any  accuracy
    at all on details of the restaurant or of his alleged work at  it.   It
    is all very well to say that there are no details of how  many  of  the
    other staff there were arrested, or that they might not be prepared  to
    talk about their experiences, but the Head Chef would know which of his
    staff were present and which were not.  There is simply  no  reason  to
    suppose that Professor Bowring and the appellant were talking about the
    ownership of the restaurant at different times, nor is there any reason
    to suppose that the ownership of the  restaurant  had  changed  at  any
    relevant time: the position is simply that this  appellant's  knowledge
    of the restaurant where he claimed to work was minimal.

11. The final ground of appeal relates to the appellant's varying  accounts
    of his departure.  Again, he was unable to give any  clear  account  of
    how his departure had been arranged: as the judge noted, he  had  first
    said that he had paid agents, then he said he sold a house  and  a  car
    and gave them the money, then he said he gave his house and his car  to
    the agent, but did not sell them.  Then he said he had given his car to
    the agent.  As the judge noted, this evidence "casts  a  question  mark
    over  whether  illegal  agents  were  used  at  all,  rather  than  the
    possessions of the family [being] sold simply as they did not intend to
    return".

12. We do not regard this even as a case where a different judge might have
    taken a different view of the evidence.  In our judgment the judge  was
    amply entitled to reach the view she did about  the  evidence,  and  we
    think that any other judge, properly instructed, would have  reached  a
    similar view.  Certainly, there is nothing in  the  grounds  of  appeal
    which gives any reason to suppose that the judge erred in law.

13. For the foregoing reasons we dismiss this appeal.
