                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision  of  Judge
    Smith made following a hearing at Bradford on 24th July 2014.

Background

 2. The claimant is a citizen of Yemen born  on  25th  January  1983.   She
    applied to come to the UK as the spouse of a British  citizen  but  was
    refused on 22nd April 2014.

 3. The original refusal, on 6th October  2013,  was  on  the  basis  that,
    whilst  the  sponsor  was  exempt  from  meeting  the  requirements  of
    paragraph E-ECP.3.1, as he was in  receipt  of  carers  allowance,  the
    claimant had to show that there was evidence of suitable  accommodation
    and that she and her sponsor could maintain and accommodate  themselves
    and any dependants adequately in the  UK  without  recourse  to  public
    funds, and on the basis that  she  was  not  exempt  from  the  English
    language requirement and had not passed an English language test with a
    provider approved by UKBA.

 4. After the Entry Clearance Officer's decision the claimant gave birth to
    a child who is a British citizen.

 5. On 22nd April 2014 the application was reviewed.  The  Entry  Clearance
    Officer  said  that  he  was  satisfied   that   there   was   suitable
    accommodation available for the claimant and that  she  had  passed  an
    English language test at the required level with a provider approved by
    the Secretary of State.  However he maintained the refusal  because  he
    was not satisfied on the basis of the bank statement evidence  provided
    that the funds available to the claimant  would  be  adequate  for  her
    maintenance.  The application was therefore refused under paragraph EC-
    P.1.1(d) of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.

 6. The sole issue before the judge therefore was whether the claimant  had
    demonstrated that she was able to maintain herself  and  any  dependant
    adequately.

 7. The judge allowed the appeal  on  the  basis  that  there  had  been  a
    material error of law and remitted the case back to the Entry Clearance
    Officer with a direction that a decision be made as to whether  Section
    EX.1 of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules applies.

 8. The Secretary of State appealed on the grounds that it was  clear  from
    Appendix FM EX.(1)(a)(b) that  the  provisions  only  apply  to  people
    living in the UK and cannot apply in entry clearance cases.

 9. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge Campbell on 28th August 2014.

The Hearing

10. It was accepted by all parties that the judge had erred in law.  It  is
    clear from the wording of Section EX.1 that it only applies  where  the
    applicant has a genuine and subsisting  parental  relationship  with  a
    child who is in the UK.

11. Accordingly the judge erred in law and the decision  needs  to  be  re-
    made.



Submissions

12. Mr Hussain did not seek to argue that as at the date of  the  decision,
    the claimant met the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules.   However
    since that time there had been a significant change  in  circumstances.
    Not only was there a British child, but the sponsor  was  now  working.
    Since he was the full-time carer for his mother  ,he  could  only  work
    sixteen hours a week but he now did have a  job  which  paid  �104  per
    week.  A letter from  his  employer  and  contract  of  employment  was
    provided.

13. There was however another  difficulty.   The  claimant  had  taken  her
    English language test with a provider which was no longer recognised by
    the Secretary of State.  In order to re-take the test she would have to
    go to Egypt as there were no English testing facilities in  the  Yemen.
    The embassy there is closed. The child had no passport  and  could  not
    travel with her.  This application had been made in Abu Dhabi  but  the
    Emirates were no longer issuing visas to Yemeni citizens.

14. Mrs Pettersen made no further submissions  save  to  observe  that  the
    sponsor's earnings now exceeded the amount of income support  to  which
    he would be entitled.

Findings and Conclusions

15. Mr Hussain did not put his case on the basis that, as at  the  date  of
    decision, the rules were met.  Nor did he seek to argue that the appeal
    could be allowed on the basis of postdecision evidence.  He did however
    submit that that evidence should be taken into account when considering
    the claimant's Article 8 rights.

16. Clearly the birth of the child and the sponsor's recent employment were
    not  circumstances  appertaining  as  at  the  date  of  decision   nor
    reasonably foreseeable to the Entry Clearance Officer and cannot  avail
    the claimant in terms of the rules.

17. Family life is assumed between the British sponsor, his  wife  and  his
    daughter.  Refusal of entry clearance is  an  interference  with  their
    right to enjoy family life in any meaningful sense, but is lawful since
    the sponsor, as at the date of decision did not meet  the  requirements
    of the Immigration Rules, and in pursuit of a  legitimate  aim,  namely
    the maintenance of immigration control.

18. The usual answer to an entry clearance claim, such as this,  where  the
    facts have changed since the date of decision,  is  that  the  claimant
    should make a re-application.  However in this case, on  the  basis  of
    the information given to me by the sponsor, and verifiable by the Entry
    Clearance Officer, it seems that there are significant obstacles to the
    claimant making such a re-application.

19. She cannot do so in the Yemen, nor in Abu Dhabi.  Her previous  English
    language certificate is not recognised and she would have to  undertake
    a three month course and take an exam  in  Egypt.   That  would  entail
    separation from her young daughter who is not able to travel out of the
    Yemen since she has no passport or travel document.

20. I am satisfied, that if such an application were to be made, since  the
    sole issue is adequacy, on the basis of the present evidence, the rules
    could be met.  The amount of money earned by the sponsor  exceeds  that
    which he would be entitled to receive on income  support.  He  used  to
    receive �45.25 per week in income support and  now  has  an  income  of
    �104.  Before he managed to gain employment his  unchallenged  evidence
    was that he was able to send approximately �35 to �50 per month to  his
    wife and had saved money for his wife's air fare.

21. In Nagre (R on the application of) v SSHD [2013] EWHC 720  counsel  for
    the Secretary of State accepted that it was possible to envisage  cases
    where the Rules would not cover  every  conceivable  case  in  which  a
    foreign national might have a good claim  for  leave  to  remain  under
    Article 8.  It was acknowledged that  there  may  be  individual  cases
    where there are -

         "particularly  compelling  reasons  arising   from   the   specific
         circumstances why leave to remain should be granted  under  Article
         8, even  though  there  may  not  be  insurmountable  obstacles  or
         barriers  to  family  life  continuing  outside  the  UK,  in   the
         applicant's country of origin."

22. The extreme practical difficulties which the claimant faces  in  making
    another  application  for  entry  clearance  is  a  compelling   factor
    acknowledged by the Secretary of State in Nagre.

23. In this case there is a significant barrier to the sponsor joining  his
    wife in the Yemen because he is the sole carer for his  mother  in  the
    UK.

24. This is an application which, on its facts, would succeed and therefore
    the weight which the Secretary of State attached to the maintenance  of
    proper immigration control is diminished.

25. In these circumstances refusal of entry clearance  is  disproportionate
    and the appeal is allowed on Article 8 grounds.

Decision

26. The original judge erred in law.  His decision is set aside.  It is re-
    made as follows.  The appeal is dismissed under the  Immigration  Rules
    but allowed on Article 8 grounds.
