                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

       This is an appeal, by the , against the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Paul Brenells), sitting at Taylor House on  6  January,
    to  a wife's appeal by a citizen of Iran, born 7 August 1982. The judge
    did so on the following basis:

      a) the sponsor, though now a  British  citizen,  had  previously  been
         recognized as a refugee from Iran, so couldn't be expected to  live
         with his wife there, and there was no evidence that they  could  do
         so anywhere else, so her  continued  exclusion  from  this  country
         would be disproportionate to the legitimate purpose of ; and

      b) although the sponsor could only show an annual income  of  �16,300,
         falling short of the �18,600 required by the  Rules,  Blake  J  had
         taken the view in MM [2013] EWHC (Admin)1900  that  an  appropriate
         figure would have been about �13,400.

 2. Since the correctness or otherwise of MM  is presently under  expedited
    consideration by the Court of Appeal, I invited argument in  the  first
    place only on (a). The Home Office's challenge to the judge's  decision
    on that point is quite simply that he gave no consideration to the line
    of authorities, following MF (Nigeria)  [2013]  EWCA  Civ  1192,  which
    require  that  there  should  be  some  'exceptional'  or  'compelling'
    circumstances to justify  departing  from  the  Rules,  before  general
    consideration is given under article 8 of the  European  Convention  on
    Human Rights to the proportionality of  expulsion  or,  in  this  case,
    exclusion.

 3. Mr Slatter's case on that is that, taking the sponsor's  difficulty  in
    returning to Iran together with the Home Office's failure to  show  any
    other country where he and the appellant could live together as husband
    and wife, any consideration at all by the judge would have  been  bound
    to lead to a finding of 'exceptional'  or  'compelling'  circumstances.

 4. The difficulty with this submission is in the opening words of appendix
    FM to the Rules:

       GEN.1.1. This route is for those seeking to enter or remain in the UK
       on the basis of their family life with a  person  who  is  a  British
       Citizen, is settled in the UK, or is in the UK with limited leave  as
       a  refugee  or  person  granted  humanitarian  protection  (and   the
       applicant cannot seek leave to enter or remain in  the  UK  as  their
       family member under Part 11 of these rules).

 5. Part 11 relates to those eligible for leave to enter under the  Refugee
    Convention, and is no longer available to this appellant, now that  the
    sponsor is a British citizen. The words set out make it clear that  the
    funding and other requirements which follow are to apply to  dependants
    of persons here with limited leave as refugees,  just  as  they  do  to
    British citizens. In very many,  if  not  most  cases,  these  will  be
    spouses left behind in the sponsor's country of origin, from  which  he
    has been granted asylum, and where it may well  not  be  reasonable  to
    expect them to live together; but the funding requirements are still to
    apply.

 6. For this reason, I regard it  as  essential  that  there  should  be  a
    decision on the basis of the Court of  Appeal's  view  of  the  funding
    requirements, as  to  whether  the  individual  circumstances  of  this
    appellant's case are indeed 'exceptional' or 'compelling'. Since  there
    is not yet any indication of when that view will  become  available,  I
    shall deal with this appeal by ruling  that,  because  of  the  judge's
    failure to consider the question of whether there were circumstances of
    that kind, his decision was wrong in law and needs to be re-made.  This
    will take place following a hearing by another judge of the  First-tier
    Tribunal, on both points (a) and  (b),  by  which  time  the  Court  of
    Appeal's decision on appeal from MM  should be available.

Decision to be re-made following fresh hearing in First-tier  Tribunal,  not
    before Judge Brenells.
