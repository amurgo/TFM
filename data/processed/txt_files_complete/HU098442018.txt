Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms G Patel (Counsel)
For the Respondent:    Ms H Aboni (Senior HOPO)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Hawden-Beal, promulgated on 1st April 2019, following  a  hearing
    at Birmingham on 27th March 2019.   In  the  determination,  the  judge
    dismissed the appeal of the Appellant, whereupon the Appellant  applied
    for, and was granted, permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal,  and
    thus the matter comes before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Pakistan, and was  born  on  21st
    March 1989.  He appealed against the decision of the  Respondent  dated
    11th April 2018, refusing his application to remain in the  UK  on  the
    basis of his human rights, namely, that he has a partner, [AR],  and  a
    child.

The Basis of the Refusal

 3. The basis of the refusal, as set out in  the  refusal  letter  of  11th
    April  2018,  was  that  although  the  Appellant  had  satisfied   the
    suitability requirements  of  the  Rules,  he  had  not  satisfied  the
    eligibility requirements of Appendix  FM  for  leave  to  remain  as  a
    partner because he failed to supply documentary evidence to  show  that
    he was residing with his partner.  Moreover, he also failed to  provide
    evidence to show that they had been cohabiting for a  period  of  least
    two years prior to the date of the application.  Furthermore, he failed
    to meet the immigration status requirements of the  Rules  because  his
    visa expired in August 2016 and he  thereafter  became  an  overstayer.
    Finally, it was not accepted that  the  Appellant  had  a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship with his son, because  the  Appellant  was  not
    named as the father in the  son's  birth  certificate.   Moreover,  the
    Appellant had been subject to a restraining order made in favour of his
    son which expired in February 2018.

The Appellant's Claim

 4. The Appellant continued to insist that the basis of his claim was  that
    he is the parent of a British child and that  there  are  Family  Court
    proceedings pending for the Appellant to  establish  contact  with  his
    child.  This meant that to deny him permission to remain in the UK  was
    a disproportionate interference in his family and private life.

The Judge's Finding

 5. The judge, in a careful  and  comprehensive  determination,  noted  the
    Appellant's evidence given orally before her, that he could not  pursue
    contact proceedings from Pakistan if he was removed there.  He also did
    not know how long how long it would take to conclude  the  proceedings.
    He feared that  if  it  took  too  long  this  would  impact  upon  the
    relationship with his child.  He had  applied  to  go  on  a  parenting
    course which was due to start  on  14th  April  2019.   It  would  last
    fourteen weeks (see paragraph 7).

 6. In the meantime, the Appellant enjoyed indirect contact with his  child
    by virtue of an indirect contact order which was made in December 2018.
     This it does by sending gifts and money every month.  He had been sent
    pictures by his estranged wife and his family have given him  money  to
    buy things for the child.  He was told by the  court  to  pay  ï¿½40  per
    month.  He has been doing that at the end  of  each  month.   His  last
    payment was on 28th February 2019.  There is no other way of exercising
    indirect contact with his child.  He was waiting for a  direct  contact
    order from the court.  The judge observed that "he accepts that he  has
    not direct contact at the moment but says that he is just waiting to do
    the course and after six months he can make another application to  the
    court for direct contact" (paragraph 7).

 7. The judge came to the finding that "the Appellant does not have  direct
    access to his son.  He has still never seen him in the  flesh  and  has
    never spoken to him" (paragraph 26).  The judge  went  on  to  conclude
    that "the Appellant cannot even meet EX.1 because there is  no  genuine
    and subsisting parental relationship with his son ...." (paragraph 27).
     The judge concluded that "the Appellant cannot establish that  he  has
    any role in his child's life at this moment in time.   His  contact  by
    consent is indirect.  He has not been involved in  any  aspect  of  his
    son's upbringing" (paragraph 28).  The  judge  also  applied  the  five
    steps set out in Razgar (see paragraphs 22 to 25)  and  concluded  that
    the Appellant had lived in Pakistan for 24 years before he  came  here,
    spoke the language of that country, and had family there, such that  it
    would be possible for him to return  and  continue  with  his  indirect
    contact arrangements from that country.

 8. The appeal was dismissed.

Grounds of Application

 9. The grounds of application state that  the  Appellant  had  provided  a
    child arrangements order which confirmed that he was a liberty to apply
    for a further child arrangements order in order to have  direct  access
    to his son once he had completed a parenting  course.   The  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge erred in finding that the Appellant had no  prospect  of
    having direct access with his son in the future.  That  being  so,  the
    judge reached an erroneous decision.

10. It was stated that the  Appellant's  bundle  contained  a  letter  from
    Article 6 law, stating that  the  Family  Court,  by  order  dated  7th
    December 2018, had already granted the Appellant indirect contact  with
    his son.  It was open to the Appellant to make a fresh application  for
    a child arrangements order once the Appellant had demonstrated a degree
    of commitment to his son by way of a direct contact, and  once  he  had
    completed a parenting course at Rosehill Children's Centre in Derby.

11. On 13th May 2019 permission to appeal was granted by  the  Tribunal  on
    the basis that although the judge had referred at paragraph 38  of  her
    decision to the Family Court order, and although she had found that the
    indirect contact could continue from Pakistan, it was arguable that the
    judge did  not  give  full  consideration  to  the  proportionality  of
    expecting the Appellant to leave the UK when he had already applied  to
    complete the required parental course which could enable to seek direct
    contact with his child.

Submissions

12. At the hearing before me on 2nd September 2019, Ms Patel, appearing  on
    behalf of the Appellant, submitted that the  Appellant  had  started  a
    parental course now, which would finish in September 2019 (this month).
     This was not the same fourteen week course  which  she  was  going  to
    undertake, as set out in the Family Court order in December 2018, which
    was to be at the Rosehill Children's Centre in Derby.  It  was  another
    much shorter course of eight weeks.  Ms Patel submitted that she  would
    have to accept that at the end of the indirect contact order there  was
    still no guarantee that the Appellant would get a direct contact order.
     Nevertheless, the Appellant had set out to do his very best  in  terms
    of showing his commitment to his child.  The judge's failure to take it
    in into account was disproportionate.

13. For her part, Ms Aboni submitted that there was no error of law in  the
    judge's determination.  She had given adequate reasons  for  coming  to
    the conclusion that  the  appeal  could  not  succeed.   All  that  the
    Appellant had at present was indirect contact and this  could  continue
    from Pakistan.  The  Family  Court  had  in  mind  the  fact  that  the
    Appellant had an impending immigration court hearing, which may  result
    in the Appellant not being given leave to remain in this  country,  and
    this would then have an adverse impact on the child.

14. She referred me to a letter in  the  Appellant's  bundle  (at  page  6)
    written by Article 6 law, to the  effect  that  "indirect  contact  was
    offered for six months but this  was  not  put  in  the  order  as  the
    magistrates felt that if Mr Qudoos was removed from the  UK,  they  did
    not want to limit the indirect contact to six months only (sic)".

15. Secondly, and more importantly, submitted Ms  Aboni,  what  the  Family
    Court order back in December 2018 had  said  was  that  "the  applicant
    father has enrolled  himself  onto  a  parenting  course  which  is  to
    commence in January 2019 at the  Rosehill  Children's  Centre,  Derby".
    The Appellant, however, had done no such thing.  He  had  not  actually
    commenced the course in January 2019 at  all.   That  was  a  14-  week
    course.  He not been able to undertake that.  He  had  now  started  an
    eight week course which was to finish in September, and was  still  not
    completed.   Third, in those circumstances, one could  simply  not  say
    that there was a real prospect of direct contact  being  given  to  the
    Appellant to see his child.

16. In reply, Ms Patel submitted that if  the  Appellant  was  required  to
    persist with indirect contact arrangements from Pakistan, the resulting
    delay in his applying for entry clearance from that  country  would  be
    detrimental to the best interests of the child.  Second, the judge  had
    erred in law by referring (at paragraph 24) to whether the decision was
    justified "when it was made in April  2018",  given  that  in  a  human
    rights appeal such a this, the position has to be looked at as of  now.



No Error of Law

17. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1)  of
    TCEA 2017) such that I should set aside the decision.  My  reasons  are
    as follows.  First, Ms Aboni is entirely correct  in  saying  that  the
    Family Court order in December 2018 was  predicated  on  the  Appellant
    enrolling himself "onto a parenting course  which  is  to  commence  in
    January 2019 at Rosehill Children's Centre, Derby". The  Appellant  did
    not enrol himself and commenced that course on that occasion.  Instead,
    he has waited no less than six months before  starting  an  eight  week
    course which will finish at the end of September this month.

18. Second, the Family Court order was clear that "the father's application
    for parental responsibility is dismissed".

19. Third, the Family Court had made  it  quite  clear  that  "whether  the
    father has leave to remain in the UK" was "one of the factors that will
    have a bearing on the question of parental responsibility".

20. Fourth, these were matters that the judge properly took into account at
    the time of her decision.

21. Finally, the judge was absolutely clear  in  being  focused  upon  "his
    son's best interests" and observed that:

         "The Family Court did not order direct contact with  the  child  in
         December 2018.  The CAFCASS officer  clearly  wanted  a  degree  of
         commitment from the Appellant and for him to undertake a  parenting
         course before any direct contact would be considered and that would
         only be considered if a fresh application was made and  there  were
         no safeguarding concerns".

22. At the time of the appeal before the judge below the Appellant had  not
    completed a parenting course.  There had not been the required  "degree
    of commitment from the Appellant" which it was  necessary  for  him  to
    show.  Indeed, the judge ended by observing that "it  is  telling  that
    this was a final order and  not  an  interim  order  such  that  direct
    contact would automatically follow after a period of  indirect  contact
    as has been my experience of such orders in the past.

23. This  indicates  to  me  that  there  was  a  question  mark  over  the
    Appellant's commitment and there were safeguarding concerns at the time
    the order was  made  such  that  only  indirect  contact  was  ordered"
    (paragraph  37).   In  the  circumstances,  the  judge  did   not   act
    disproportionately in concluding that the Appellant  was  well-able  to
    continue with indirect contact arrangements from  Pakistan.   It  is  a
    feature of this appeal that, as the judge made clear, this is a  father
    who has had no direct contact with his child ever at all, never  having
    seen him in the flesh, and never even having spoken to  him  (paragraph
    26).

Notice of Decision

24. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the  making  of
    an error on a point of law.  The decision shall stand.

25. No anonymity direction is made.

26. This appeal is dismissed.
