      i). An appellant who can establish that he has a history that suggests
        he may have connections to international terrorism is at real  risk
        of being detained on arrival in Algeria, and investigated.

      ii).    It  is  reasonably  likely  that  when  the  suspicion  is  of
        international terrorism such a returnee will  be  passed  into  the
        hands of the Department du Rens�ignement de la Securit� ("DRS") for
        further interrogation.

   iii) The historic evidence about the DRS's propensity to use torture  as
        a means of interrogation, together with the continuing  absence  of
        any evidence of accountability  or  monitoring,  strongly  suggests
        that, in the absence of evidence to the  contrary,  the  DRS  still
        uses torture and other  serious  ill-treatment  in  its  places  of
        secret incommunicado detention.

    iv) In the light of the further report from Dr Seddon, and of  both  Y,
        BB and U v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2007] UKSIAC
        32/2005, and PP v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2007]
        UKSIAC 54/2006, the Tribunal sees no basis  for  doing  other  than
        confirming that HS (Terrorist suspect -  risk)  Algeria  CG  [2008]
        UKAIT 00048 (heard before the SIAC Cases) was correct and that  the
        risk categories set out therein do not require widening.

For the Appellant:     Ms C M Fielden, Counsel instructed by CLC Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Blundell, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a citizen of Algeria.  He  was  born  on  30  November
    1964.   He claims to have arrived in the United Kingdom on  13  October
    2003 using a false French passport and claimed asylum the same day.  He
    was accompanied by his wife and three other dependants.

2.   His application was refused.  An appeal was heard by Immigration  Judge
    Entwistle on 25 October 2005.  That appeal was dismissed, the appellant
    applied for a review and on 20 December 2005 Senior Immigration  Judge
    Jordan ordered reconsideration.

The Error of Law in the First Determination

3.   On 20 March 2007 Senior Immigration Judge Goldstein considered  whether
    there had been an error of law in the Immigration Judge's determination
    and concluded that there had, but only on one  discrete  and  important
    issue.  In giving his  reasons  for  making  that  finding  the  Senior
    Immigration Judge said:-

          "...there  was  before  the  Immigration  Judge  a  discrete   but
         important issue, as to whether the Appellant would  be  viewed  as
         having links with international  terrorists  or  would  indeed  be
         perceived as a terrorist, owing to the time that he spent  out  of
         Algeria  in  Pakistan,  Saudi  Arabia  and  the  Yemen  and  as  a
         consequence of the work that he undertook in those countries,  and
         thus be at real risk on return to Algeria.  As properly identified
         by  the  parties,  there  was  an  absence  of  findings  by   the
         Immigration Judge in relation to these matters. Thus and for  like
         reason, I agreed that the determination disclosed a material error
         of law. "


4.   We do  not  propose  to  summarise  again  the  general  basis  of  the
    appellant's claim to asylum but we do need to set out the  findings  at
    paragraph 20(i) to  (vii)  of  the  Immigration  Judge's  determination
    because Senior Immigration Judge Goldstein directed that  the  findings
    therein should stand.  The following is a summary of those findings:-

    20(i)         The appellant qualified as a teacher  in  1983  and  left
             Algeria for  the  first  time  in  September  1989,  going  to
             Pakistan for ten months.  He returned to Algeria in  1990  and
             regularly spoke out against the government at the mosque.   He
             visited France in December 1990  and  in  April/May  1991  for
             employment reasons.  In 1991 he claimed to have  heard  via  a
             cousin and a distant  relative  who  was  a  gendarme  that  a
             potential case was being opened against  him  in  common  with
             others who had previously been in Pakistan.   The  Immigration
             Judge  said  he  placed  little  weight  on  the   appellant's
             assertions that the Secret Service had a dossier, or file,  on
             him.  The appellant had not  claimed  he  was  ever  arrested,
             detained or tortured for any activity in Algeria or because he
             had lived abroad, particularly in Pakistan.


    20(ii)        When the appellant was out of  Algeria  it  was  for  the
             purpose  of  employment  and  economic  betterment.   He  left
             Algeria in 1991 for Saudi Arabia and then travelled  to  Yemen
             in September that year.  He worked in Yemen as a teacher until
             1993.  In 1993 he travelled to Saudi Arabia where  he  married
             in Jeddah in 1993, his mother having  arranged  the  marriage.
             The marriage was registered at the Algerian Embassy.  He  then
             went to Pakistan again until  September  1993  and  taught  in
             refugee camps.  That was followed by a teaching job  in  Yemen
             which he had until 1995.


    20(iii)   Having married, the appellant's wife returned to  Algeria  in
             1994 with "her son".  She remained there for two months.   She
             had  no  problems  on  arrival  but  claims   to   have   been
             interrogated when she  was  leaving  again.   The  Immigration
             Judge did not accept she would have left her  son  behind,  as
             she did, if she was aware that the authorities were interested
             in the appellant.  The Immigration Judge did not  accept  that
             when the appellant went to the Algerian Embassy  in  Yemen  in
             1994 to renew his passport he was told that he was wanted, but
             does seem to have  accepted  that  the  passport  renewal  was
             refused.


    20(iv)    The  appellant  had  never  joined  any  political  party  in
             Algeria, and in particular not FIS.


    20(v)         The Immigration Judge  did  not  accept  the  appellant's
             claimed reasons for his passport  not  being  renewed  in  the
             Yemen noting that the appellant's wife's passport was renewed.
              He concluded that the Algerian  authorities  had  no  adverse
             interest in the appellant at that time.


    20(vi)    The Immigration Judge recorded that, when the  appellant  was
             in Sierra Leone, the fact he had altered his old passport  was
             discovered.  He was refused another visa for the  country  and
             had no alternative but to leave.  He did not claim  asylum  in
             Sierra Leone.  He decided to travel to London but was stopped,
             when in transit, in the Netherlands because the alterations to
             his passport were noticed.  When he was refused permission  to
             continue his journey, he claimed asylum.  When his application
             was refused, his appeal  was dismissed and it was  made  clear
             by the Netherland's authorities that he would be  returned  to
             Algeria or Sierra Leone he  left,  on  13  October  2003,   to
             travel to the United Kingdom  using false documents.


    20(vii)   The Immigration Judge said  the  appellant  had  been  living
             outside Algeria for fourteen years at the time of the  appeal.
             He found no evidence to substantiate  a  fear  of  persecution
             when he left.  He noted that  the  appellant  had  produced  a
             third explanation for his passport not being renewed in Yemen.
              He first said it was because  some  documents  were  missing;
             second because he was wanted, his third explanation  was  that
             it was  because  there  was  a  Pakistan  stamp  in  it.   The
             Immigration Judge expressly said he did not believe  that  the
             appellant  had  been  told  he  was  wanted.   He  noted   the
             appellant's claim that he would not be safe  on  returning  to
             Algeria with a laissez passer.


    20(viii)  This sub-paragraph did not contain any findings of fact.


5.   Although there was no reference in the Immigration Judge's analysis  of
    the evidence, or his findings, to Dr Seddon's report,  it  clearly  was
    before him.  It is referred to in the list  of  evidence  at  paragraph
    9(iv)  and  there  is  a  passing  reference  to  it  in  the  recorded
    submissions of the Presenting Officer, but nothing else.

Our Approach

6.   We need to go behind some of the Immigration Judge's  findings  because
    much  of  the  argument  before  us  concerned  the  identity  of   the
    organisations that the appellant worked for  during  his  time  outside
    Algeria.  The Immigration Judge said no more  than  that  the  evidence
    about this was not disputed.  As our task  is  to  decide  whether  the
    places in which the appellant worked, and the organisations  he  worked
    for, together with his long absence from Algeria and a history  of  two
    failed asylum claims would be sufficient to put  him  at  risk,  it  is
    obviously important to consider the organisations.  Dr Seddon  included
    a curriculum vitae with each of his reports, and he  is  known  to  the
    Tribunal before which he has often given evidence.   We  accept  he  is
    qualified to give expert evidence on Algeria.  Dr Seddon  analysed  the
    appellant's employers at Section 2 of his report dated 18 October 2005.
     Dr Seddon said that, after undertaking his military service  which  he
    concluded in 1988 the appellant was unable to take up his previous  job
    as a primary school teacher and decided to go  to  Pakistan  to  assist
    with teaching Afghan refugees on the Afghan/Pakistan border.   He  went
    in September 1989 for ten months,  teaching  Arabic.   On  arrival,  he
    first  lived  in  Rawalpindi  near  Islamabad,  and   worked   for   an
    organisation called the "Social Reform Organisation", for seven months.
     That organisation is based in Kuwait.  He then went to Peshawar where,
    depending which account is accepted, he  worked  either  for  the  same
    organisation, or for the World Islamic  Relief  Organisation  which  is
    based in Jeddah in Saudi Arabia.

7.   Having been back to Algeria, and moved between  there  and  France  the
    appellant left again.  He went first to Mecca, and  then  in  September
    1991 to Yemen.  In Yemen he had a teaching job in a primary  school  in
    Ibb, and later one in Sana'a.  When his job in Yemen was terminated  in
    1993  he  went  back  to  Pakistan.    He  stayed  from  January  until
    September.  He taught for the  Tamir  Organisation,  again  in  refugee
    camps, staying in Peshawar.  There followed another  period  in  Yemen,
    until 1995, when he again obtained a  teaching  job.   Thereafter,  the
    appellant went to Sierra Leone, where he worked for the "Africa  Muslim
    Agency", based in Kuwait.

The Evidence before us

8.   On 5 February we heard  the  evidence  in  this  reconsideration.   The
    appellant did not give evidence, although he was present.  Despite what
    was said to Senior Immigration Judge Goldstein, we did not hear from Mr
    Boudjema Bounoua.   There was a witness present, Samir Touaiti, who had
    written a letter to the appellant's solicitor in which he said:-


        "I am writing to you as a witness for AF I knew him since 1993  and
         1994 when I met him in Yemen.  He worked  there  as  a  teacher  in
         primary schools. I believe that AF will be at risk in Algeria if he
         moved  there  because  he  worked  as  a  teacher  for   a   relief
         organisation in Pakistan and I will be happy  to  attend  the  full
         hearing who (sic) will take place on Thursday 5 February 2009 as  a
         witness."


9.   A copy of this letter had been sent to Mr Blundell,  who  said  he  did
    not wish to ask the witness any questions about the letter but  he  did
    want the Tribunal to know that, despite asking for further details from
    the appellant's solicitor, he had been unable to find any trace  of  Mr
    Touaiti and therefore had no idea who he is.  He had previously  warned
    Ms Fielden that he was going to say that but she did not  wish  to  ask
    the witness any questions.

10.  The bulk of the day was taken  up  by  evidence  from  Dr  Seddon.   Dr
    Seddon had produced three reports.  The first dated  18  October  2005,
    was before the Immigration Judge.  The second  was  an  updated  report
    dated  30  November  2006  which  post-dated  the  Immigration  Judge's
    hearing. The third was a report signed on 3  February  2009.   In  each
    report he sets out his credentials as an expert.  We accept that he  is
    well qualified to give expert evidence about Algeria.

     Dr Seddon's First Report

11.  In section two Dr Seddon set out the appellant's account,  not  all  of
    which was subsequently accepted by the Tribunal.  The third section  of
    the report contained Dr Seddon's comments about the reasons given  for
    refusing the appellant's claim.  An Appendix set  out  the  appellant's
    history and placed it in  the  context  of  political  developments  in
    Algeria and the significance of the areas where the appellant had been.
     In particular in paragraph 3.8 he dealt with  the  organisations  that
    the  appellant  worked  for.   He  said   that   the   "Social   Reform
    Organisation", which he believed was also referred to in the literature
    as "The Social Reform Society", is an Islamic  charitable  organisation
    based in Kuwait.  He said that  it  is  one  of  fifteen  organisations
    listed by the Russian Government as terrorist organisations.   He  said
    that Russian law enforcement bodies  first  became  interested  in  its
    activities in Moscow in 2002 and the authorities took  steps  to  close
    down the operation in spring 2003 although a Supreme Court hearing  was
    postponed due to the absence of the organisation's Moscow Director.

12.  Dr Seddon said he could not find details of the  World  Islamic  Relief
    Organisation  but  concluded   that   it   was   almost   certainly   a
    mistranslation and should have been the "International  Islamic  Relief
    Organisation" ("ILRO").  He said that is a well-known  Islamic  charity
    operating from Jeddah.  He said  that  the  Secretary  General  of  the
    Muslim  World  League  has  stated  publicly  that  the  ILRO  is   the
    "operational arm" of the Muslim World League, which, importantly,   was
    founded by the founders of Al Qaeda.  One  of  the  September  11  2001
    hijackers worked for the ILRO in the United States.

13.  The Tamir Organisation  is  also  an  Islamic  charitable  organisation
    based in Kuwait.  Dr Seddon said that it could easily be confused  with
    the Pakistani "Umma Tamir-e-Nau".  That organisation is listed  in  the
    United States Terrorist Exclusion List as a terrorist organisation.

14.  The African Muslim Agency, for  which  the  appellant  claims  to  have
    worked in Sierra Leone,  provides  relief  in  African  countries.   Dr
    Seddon said it is part of the Safa Group and is based in Virginia.   He
    described  the  Safa  Group  as  a  complex  coalition  of  overlapping
    companies registered in Northern Virginia and controlled by individuals
    who  have  shown  support  for  terrorists   and/or   terrorist   front
    organisations.

15.   In  the  Appendix,  Dr  Seddon  dealt  with  the   rise   in   Islamic
    fundamentalism and its connection with Afghanistan.  It  seemed  to  us
    from his later evidence that this was important explanatory evidence of
    the Algerians' attitude towards various Middle Eastern  countries.   He
    recorded how, as early as 1979 after Soviet troops entered Afghanistan,
    an organisation called Makhab al-Khidomat ("MAK"), translated  as  'the
    Office of Services', was established to support the many young  Muslims
    from the Arab world who were fighting with the Afghan  Mujahedeen.   He
    said that, during the 1980s, particularly the second  half,  many  such
    young men, including from Algeria, passed through the hands of the  MAK
    to fight with the Mujahedeen.  He estimated that there may have been as
    many as 15,000 to 25,000 Arab volunteers.  It was in  1986  that  Osama
    bin Laden set up his own training camp for Arabs  from  the  Gulf.   In
    1988 that was developed, with Egyptian colleagues, into Al Qaeda  which
    translates as "The Base".  It started  as  a  loose  network  of  Arabs
    committed  to  holy  war.   At  around  this  time  Saudi  Arabia  gave
    considerable financial and other  assistance  to  the  Mujahedeen,  and
    Osama bin  Laden  brought  considerable  resources  to  help  with  the
    Islamist opposition in Afghanistan.  Dr  Seddon  estimated  that  3,000
    Algerians were involved.

16.  During 1988 and 1991 Islamists, notably  the  Islamic  Salvation  Front
    ("FIS"), began to gain strength and  support  inside  Algeria.   Whilst
    some were attracted to fighting  in  Afghanistan,  others  remained  in
    Algeria to oppose the Algerian Government.  When the Russians  withdrew
    from Afghanistan in 1989/90 some of those who had been  fighting  there
    returned to Algeria and reinforced the Islamists who had  been  engaged
    in the armed struggle to overthrow the existing state.  Dr Seddon  said
    that it is significant that the appellant was in Pakistan during period
    1998  and  1999,  working  closely  with   Afghan   refugees   on   the
    Afghan/Pakistan border, for  a  Saudi-based  relief  organisation,  and
    furthermore that he returned to Algeria just as the Islamist opposition
    was becoming visibly stronger.

17.  By 1990 the Algerian authorities were becoming  increasingly  concerned
    about  the  strength  of  support  for  the   fundamentalist   Islamist
    opposition, which gained further ground  in  1991,  winning  the  first
    round of parliamentary elections in December.  The existing  government
    declared a state of emergency in February 1992 and cancelled the second
    round of elections, and banned Islamist groups.  This proved to be  the
    start of the major conflict between  the  armed  paramilitary  Islamist
    opposition groups and the Algerian Government.

18.  The report referred to Osama bin Laden's move to Saudi  Arabia  at  the
    end of the war against the Soviet troops in Afghanistan.  Whilst  there
    he began to organise to launch a jihad against the US military presence
    in Saudi Arabia.  He left for Sudan when the Saudi Government sought to
    arrest him.  The appellant was in Saudi Arabia at the time  when  Osama
    bin Laden was attempting to launch that struggle.

19.  When Osama bin Laden  went  to  Sudan,  the  appellant  moved  back  to
    Pakistan and the Afghan refugee camps.  Dr Seddon quoted  from  a  book
    "Afghan Wars" which described how charitable  organisations  mushroomed
    and that many were  involved  in  teaching  radical  or  fundamentalist
    versions of Sunni Islam to the displaced Afghan population in Pakistan.
     The author of the book considered that had led to the  development  of
    the Taliban.  Around 1993, the appellant said, the Algerian authorities
    asked the Pakistan Government to return all Algerians who were in  that
    part of Pakistan.  He said that one of the main reasons was the fear of
    large-scale radicalisation of those Algerians who remained in Pakistan,
    with the possibility of their involvement with emerging fundamentalists
    like the Taliban  and  their  later  return  to  Algeria  to  join  the
    paramilitary opposition.  At  paragraph  A1.15  it  is  said  that  the
    Algerians wanted their citizens from Pakistan extradited  and  returned
    so they could be dealt with on return and not allowed  to  filter  back
    unofficially and start covert operations.  The appellant  said  it  was
    learning of this that caused him to  move  to  Yemen  at  a  time  when
    fundamentalism was on the rise there.  It is unclear from that  section
    of the report  whether  Dr  Seddon  had  independent  evidence  of  the
    Algerian authorities asking for Algerians to be returned, or whether he
    was merely repeating the appellant's assertion.

20.  Dr Seddon referred to the Yemeni Government's increasing concern  about
    the extent of Saudi support for radical Islamist groups  and  of  Arabs
    returning from the Afghan conflict to work with  active  groups  within
    the country.  This was at the time when the appellant  was  living  and
    working in Yemen.  He gave  details  of  terrorist  activity  in  Yemen
    between 1996 and 1997.  He referred to an incident in which an Algerian
    who had been living in Britain, and five young  British  Muslims,  were
    arrested in connection with a plot to bomb the British  Consulate.   Dr
    Seddon suggested that, although the appellant had left Yemen  by  then,
    to the Algerian authorities the  significance  of  his  stay  there  is
    likely to be informed by their general perception of Yemen.

21.  The final part  of  the  Appendix  (A1.22  to  A1.34)  dealt  with  the
    security situation at that time in Algeria.  We do not  refer  to  that
    because matters have moved on considerably in the last three years.

Dr Seddon's Second and Third Reports

22.  Dr Seddon's second report was an updating  report.   It  dealt  largely
    with circumstances in Algeria, in particular the Charter for Peace  and
    National Reconciliation and the question  of  return  with  assurances.
    Again, things have moved on since 2006 and  there  is  little  in  that
    report which is now of current interest.  As with the first  report  we
    have read it in its entirety.  The changes in Algeria are  acknowledged
    in the third report (at paragraph 3.2).  Dr  Seddon  also  acknowledged
    the  Algerian  cases  decided  by  the  Special   Immigration   Appeals
    Commission and a recent Country Guidance Case HS (Terrorist  suspect  -
    risk) Algeria CG [2008] UKAIT 00048.  At Section 4 Dr Seddon  discussed
    the Charter for Peace and  National  Reconciliation,  highlighting  the
    fact that, not only did it provide for an  amnesty  for  many  Islamist
    militants, but also had the effect  of  making  it  difficult,  if  not
    impossible to challenge past human rights abuses  by  the  authorities.
    The precise terms of the Charter are not relevant to  this  appeal  but
    can be found in Y v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2006]
    UKSIAC 36/2004 ('Y').  Dr Seddon reported in paragraph 4.5  that  both
    Human Rights Watch and  Amnesty  International  argue  that  preventing
    investigation of past human rights abuses has given a  green  light  to
    those who committed them, to continue.

23.  In Section 5 Dr Seddon dealt with the  continuing  Algerian  commitment
    to fighting terrorism.  In paragraph 5.2 he reported that  security  in
    Algeria has been tightened  as  a  result  of  fears  by  the  Algerian
    Government,  and  the  United  States,  that  operations  by  extremist
    Islamist groups in Southern Algeria have  increased  in  recent  years.
    This is said to be notably at the hands of the Groupe Salafist pour  la
    Pr�dication et la Combat (Salafist  Cell  and  Combat  Party)  ("GSPC")
    which is now re-named Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb.  In 5.3 he cited
    a number of terrorist acts that occurred during 2007 and in 2008,  much
    of it claimed by Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb.  In paragraph 5.4  he
    said:-

        "The security forces in Algeria (and notably the DRS) continue,  as
         a result to implement a strategy of counter insurgency with  little
         regard for the law or for human rights.  The risk of being  subject
         to harassment and persecution by the security forces  on  suspicion
         of being in some way sympathetic to  or  involved  with  the  armed
         Islamic groups is still very real.   Those known to be,  and  those
         thought to be, associated with Islamist groups  have  in  the  past
         frequently and  often  indiscriminately  been  arrested,  detained,
         tortured and in some cases subject to extrajudicial execution.   An
         Amnesty International visit to  Algeria  from  6  to  25  May  2005
         referred to torture being defined as a criminal offence  and  to  a
         reduction in allegations of torture and ill-treatment by the police
         and gendarmerie.  But the AI  mission  did  receive  a  significant
         number of allegations of torture  and  ill-treatment  by  the  DRS.
         Torture included beatings and  the  'chiffon'  treatment.   The  AI
         mission noted that such torture generally  takes  place  in  secret
         locations impossible  for  the  detainee  to  locate.   Torture  is
         frequently not recorded by doctors examining detainees".


    He went on in paragraph 5.5 to refer to  Amnesty  International's  July
     2006 report on torture by the Algerian  military  security,  and  a  US
     State Department Report of 2006 which highlighted the activities of the
     Department du Rens�ignement de la Securit�  ("DRS")  and  the  impunity
     under which it operates.  Human Rights Watch described to  a  UN  Human
     Rights  Committee,  in  2007,  how  the  DRS  operations  were  "almost
     untouchable"; and legal safeguards were all but  routinely  disregarded
     by the DRS, according to Amnesty.  Dr Seddon then went on to make  some
     observations about the Tribunal's determination in HS  (Algeria)  which
     quoted from the same background material and  to  which  we  will  come
     separately in the course of considering the submissions.


24.  Dr Seddon observed that, unlike the appellants in the  SIAC  cases,  if
    this appellant were to be returned to Algeria he  would  not  have  the
    benefit of either general assurances or individual specific  assurances
    from the Algerian authorities or monitoring by the British Embassy.  Dr
    Seddon's report concluded that, with his apparent support  for  Islamic
    charities (because he has worked for them) and the fact  he  has  lived
    for a considerable time outside Algeria, both  in  Europe,  the  Middle
    East and West Africa in  a  context  where  he  could  have  had  ample
    opportunity to make contact with and associate with Islamic  militants;
    and that as he has sought asylum on more than one occasion, there is  a
    strong possibility that he will be detained.  If so  that  would  quite
    probably be 'garde a vue', when the appellant can be  held  for  up  to
    twelve days and during which  he  is  likely  to  be  ill-treated,  and
    possibly tortured.  Dr Seddon concluded, that the appellant would be at
    serious risk of ill-treatment and torture during such a long  prolonged
    period of detention.


Dr Seddon's Oral Evidence

25.  Dr Seddon started by telling us that it was generally accepted  that  a
    returnee without a passport to Algeria would travel on a laissez passer
    which would immediately identify him as a failed asylum seeker.  He had
    it from a variety of sources that it would be routine for such a person
    to be detained for longer than normal and, as the  appellant  had  been
    out of the country for a long time, travelled widely in the Middle East
    and was a failed asylum seeker, the authorities would be interested  to
    know where he had been and  why  he  had  claimed  asylum  twice.   His
    profile would strike them as unusual.  He thought that,  whilst  it  is
    not a matter of certainty, the immigration authorities would start  the
    questioning of the appellant but, in view of his  distinctive  profile,
    they would quickly bring in either the  Judicial  Police  or  DRS.   It
    would be one of  them  that  would  decide  if  further  detention  was
    appropriate.  He thought that in the appellant's case it would probably
    be the DRS, because there may be reasonable suspicion  of  illegitimate
    activity.  The DRS has a number of detention facilities.  He  said  DRS
    is the subject of much discussion, in particular about its relationship
    with the other security services.  He described the DRS as the harshest
    of the intelligence agencies and said it was under only limited control
    of the Justice Department.  Both Amnesty and Human  Rights  Watch  have
    researched the DRS and believe that it uses ill-treatment  and  torture
    as part of their interrogation methods.  He felt that  the  appellant's
    case depended to a large extent on the likelihood of detention  by  the
    DRS.   Asked  whether  detention  by  the  judicial  police  would   be
    acceptable, Dr Seddon thought that the problems were particularly  with
    the DRS.  Whereas the judiciary and the police  no  longer  operate  as
    independently as they once did, and although the conditions in  prisons
    are improving, it does not mean that torture does not continue to  some
    extent.  The fact that the appellant has been  travelling  abroad,  and
    had contact with Islamic charities, and has been in Sierra Leone meant,
    in Dr Seddon's view, that it would be thought more appropriate for  the
    DRS to investigate him  as  the  Judicial  Police  tend  to  deal  with
    internal  matters.   He  said  there  are  also  other   more   shadowy
    governmental, or paragraph-governmental, agencies that little is  known
    about.

26.  Dr Seddon ran through the organisations with which  the  appellant  had
    been associated but did  not  say  anything  beyond  what  was  in  his
    reports.  He added that what mattered was not whether the appellant had
    actually been involved  in  fundraising  for  terrorism  through  those
    organisations but simply the fact that he had worked  for  them.   That
    was significant because the Algerian authorities  would  want  to  know
    whether he had associated with terrorists.  He said that  some  of  the
    organisations actually had been involved with terrorist activities  and
    not just funding.  He suggested that claiming asylum twice  illustrated
    a possible fear of returning to Algeria.

27.  He was taken to his most recent report and asked whether  the  risk  on
    return to Algeria was greater now, than it would have been two or three
    years ago.  Dr Seddon said that in 2003,  2004  and  2005  things  were
    improving and the Algerians were getting on top of the Islamist threat.
     As a result the reasons for ill-treating people had begun  to  reduce.
    However, in 2007 GSPC made explicit links to Al Qaeda, and there was an
    upsurge in incidents within Algeria throughout 2007 and 2008.  That led
    to a different picture from that of three or four years ago.  He  said,
    whilst the United Kingdom had returned  some  high  profile  Algerians,
    that was through SIAC.  This case is different in  that  the  appellant
    has not been identified as a threat within the UK and therefore had not
    been given specific assurances by Algeria which would give a degree  of
    protection.  There is  no  suggestion  of  monitoring  by  the  British
    Embassy for the appellant.

28.   Dr  Seddon  was  shown  the  Amnesty  International  Report  for  2007
    (produced by the respondent) where it is said:-

        "There were persistent reports  of  torture  and  ill-treatment  of
         suspects detained by  the  authorities  and  accused  of  terrorism
         related activities and there were concerns  over  the  fairness  of
         trials and terrorism related and politically motivated cases."


    Under the heading "Violations in Counter  Terrorism"  the  report  said
     that torture continued  to  be  used  with  impunity,  with  persistent
     reports of torture and other ill-treatment of people in the custody  of
     the DRS.  He was also shown the 2008 report where the passage does  not
     appear and was asked if things had  improved.   He  said  that  he  had
     brought the situation up-to-date, from paragraph 5.5 of his most recent
     report.  He noted a reference, in the 2008 Amnesty  Report,  to  secret
     detention centres continuing to be used.  Asked whether the SIAC cases,
     Y, BB and U v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2007]  UKSIAC
     32/2005 and PP v Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department  [2007]
     UKSIAC 54/2006 (handed down on 2 November and 23 November respectively)
     made any difference to his views about the conclusions in  HS  Algeria,
     Dr  Seddon  said  those  were  all  cases  where  there  were  specific
     assurances by the Algerian Government, whereas the appellant would have
     none.  He said whilst he was  still  sceptical  that  deportation  with
     assurances and monitoring were the answer, undoubtedly those  that  did
     have the benefit of them were better off.  He felt that those cases did
     not show any change to the risks to this appellant.  Asked whether  the
     DRS was under control, or whether it  still  acted  with  impunity,  Dr
     Seddon said  that  the  evidence  appeared  to  be  that  it  is  still
     autonomous, that it has its own secret detention centres and that there
     is no external  monitoring.   He  said  Amnesty  continues  to  express
     concern.  There is a debate about whether the position of  the  DRS  is
     intentional or unintentional  within  the  structure  of  the  Algerian
     authorities  but,  whichever,  it  is  credible  to  say  that  it   is
     autonomous.


29.  Dr Seddon was cross-examined by Mr Blundell.   The  latter  started  by
    referring him to paragraph 3.7 of his first report.  There he had  said
    that there  was  corroborating  evidence  to  show  that  the  Algerian
    authorities had been particularly concerned  about  Algerian  nationals
    living and working in Pakistan since the emergence of Al Qaeda, and its
    recruitment and training of the "Afghan  Arabs".   He  was  asked  what
    evidence was referred to in the report which linked  to  that  comment.
    Dr Seddon said that, since 1990, Algeria has expressed concerns and the
    Algerian representatives in Peshawar were asked to  keep  tabs  on  the
    Algerians in Pakistan.  Dr Seddon said  there  had  been  a  series  of
    references in the press which he acknowledged he had not documented but
    which  showed  increasing  concerns  about  Algerians  returning   from
    Afghanistan  and  Chechnya  and  then  joining  Islamist  movements  in
    Algeria.  He said that,  over  the  period,  there  had  been  specific
    concerns about the involvement of Algerian nationals  in  international
    jihad especially in Chechnya.

30.  He was then taken to paragraph A.13.   There  he  said  there  were  an
    estimated 3,000 Algerian nationals who had been involved in Afghanistan
    and which the Algerian authorities had been keen to repatriate, and had
    requested Pakistan to help.  Asked if there was any evidence about  the
    results of that request, Dr Seddon did not  know.   Asked  whether  he
    thought it was relevant to know what had happened  to  those  returnees
    from Pakistan, Dr Seddon said that concerns were raised in  1991.   FIS
    were successful in the elections, and it was only when FIS looked  like
    coming to power that a state of emergency was declared.   He said  that
    was fifteen years ago, and we are now in a different period.   He  said
    that Algerian concerns are now about links to international dissent and
    international terrorism.  When it was put to him that there was  little
    international terrorism at the time that Pakistan was  being  asked  to
    assist, Dr Seddon said the Algerians  have  been  concerned  about  the
    international dimension for about fifteen years.  Pressed,  Dr   Seddon
    said that he had no evidence  about  when  the  3,000  went  back.   He
    emphasised that he did not say that there was no evidence, merely  that
    he did not have it.  He accepted that he probably  should  have  looked
    into the issue.

31.  He was then taken to paragraph 3.8 of the first  report  where  he  set
    out the information he had about the various  organisations  for  which
    the appellant had worked.  He was asked to what extent it could be said
    that these were organisations which had "gone bad" in later years,  and
    whether  they  could  have  been  innocuous  when  the  appellant   was
    associated with  them.   Dr  Seddon  said  that  evidence  about  their
    activities only becomes available once they appear on  the  radar.   No
    doubt the appellant would say that they were  legitimate  when  he  was
    working with them.  Dr Seddon said he was not  arguing  that  all  the
    organisations were funding  terrorism,   but,  in  2009,  the  Algerian
    authorities would find the appellant's  past   association  with  these
    organisations suspicious.  At least  some  of  them  were  involved  in
    terrorism even if others were legitimate.  It  was  in  2002  when  the
    Social Reform Society had been identified as a  terrorist  organisation
    but, he said, there would no doubt have been a  time  lag  between  the
    onset of their activity and their being identified.  He emphasised that
    it was not just one organisation, but all those for which the appellant
    worked, which appeared suspect.  There was nothing  to  say  that  they
    were involved when the appellant was with them.  For example, Al  Qaeda
    only emerged in 1993 and the appellant was in the area when  they  were
    in their emerging period.  He did not think that if the appellant  were
    to say that the organisations were legitimate when he was  working  for
    them that would be determinative because the Algerians  would  look  at
    what they know now.

32.  Mr Blundell put it to Dr Seddon  that  he  put  weight,  in  paragraphs
    3.10, 3.14 and 3.15 of his first report, on the  appellant's  assertion
    that he was  known  to  the  regime  and  on  a  blacklist.   Also,  at
    paragraphs 2.2 and 2.3 of the second report there is the assertion that
    the appellant believed the Algerian authorities considered him a threat
    to state security and that he was told he was wanted  by  the  Algerian
    authorities.  He was  reminded  that  those  assertions  had  not  been
    accepted by the Tribunal and asked whether  he  appreciated  that,  and
    whether it would have made a difference to the conclusions at  the  end
    of his second report.  Dr Seddon said it would have made no  difference
    to the broad conclusions.  He said there was evidence  to  suggest  the
    appellant had been under some sort of  surveillance,  for  example  his
    wife was detained and that was the same sort of evidence.  He said that
    his conclusions today about risk would not  materially  change  if  all
    that aspect was not credible. His  conclusion  was  that  the  risk  is
    because of the  appellant's  profile  and  not  because  he  was  being
    tracked.  His vulnerability from his association with the organisations
    and his seventeen year absence would be enough, in Dr Seddon's opinion,
    to create an unacceptable risk.

33.  It was put to Dr Seddon that it was  significant  that  there  were  no
    examples, in any report, of people having encountered adverse attention
    in circumstances similar to the appellant's.  Dr Seddon said he had not
    been able to find any evidence of individuals with a  similar  profile,
    despite looking.  When it was put to him that the appellant cannot have
    been unique, to have been working with charities in Pakistan, Dr Seddon
    said that what is unusual about the appellant is the  range  of  places
    and organisations, namely Pakistan, Yemen and Saudi  Arabia  (he  could
    have added Sierra Leone).  At the time there were Algerians in Pakistan
    and  Algerians  fighting  in  Afghanistan.   Mr  Blundell  asked  again
    whether, as Amnesty International, UNHCR and Human  Rights  Watch  have
    focused so much on human rights in Algeria, he would have  expected  to
    have seen published examples of  people  returning  after  working  for
    Islamic charities.  Dr Seddon said that he had found no such  reference
    in anything, including reports from Algerian NGOs, to a comparable case
    to that of the appellant.  He did not know whether he had  missed  them
    but he did not think so, but said that even NGOs do not see everything.
      He  emphasised  again  the  appellant's  persistent  and  distinctive
    profile.

34.  Mr Blundell asked Dr Seddon whether there was any evidence  to  support
    the assertions, in his paragraph 3.16, that those suspected of possible
    involvement with terrorist groups are treated harshly, that brutal ill-
    treatment  and  torture   of   political   detainees   continues,   and
    extrajudicial killings had not entirely ceased.   Dr Seddon  said  the
    evidence was referred to at paragraph A1.32 which was  a  reference  to
    Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International Reports,  both  for  2003,
    and from paragraph A1.25 to A1.32 there were other references.  He said
    the reports that he referred  to  cover  2001  to  2005.   Mr  Blundell
    suggested the reports were as old as 2002/2003, and  then  referred  to
    the SIAC case of Y where, at paragraph 341, it was  said  that  torture
    was markedly declining.  Asked whether he could associate himself  with
    the conclusions in Y, which was handed down  on  24 August  2006,   Dr
    Seddon said that the range of SIAC comments were  in  his  view  unduly
    optimistic, but he broadly agreed with it.  He said that  between  2003
    and 2006 there  had  been  a  general  feeling  of  optimism  that  the
    government was overcoming the threats from terrorism, although  it  was
    only right to say that there were continuing reports,  throughout  2006
    and 2007, and the Amnesty report of 2008, which said that  torture  was
    continuing.  He acknowledged that there has been pressure from  outside
    Algeria, not least by the UK Government, to improve  matters  but  that
    did not mean that abuses did not continue.  Even within  Algeria  there
    is discussion about the need for a continuing state of  emergency  but,
    certainly in 2005, things were improving.  He observed that  SIAC  were
    prepared to accept that there was insufficient  risk,  particularly  if
    assurances were given, but he still considered that was over confident.
     He reiterated that, since early 2007 there have been the new links  to
    Al Qaeda abroad, and an upsurge in bombings between 2007 and 2008.   He
    suggested that in those circumstances it was not surprising  that  some
    sections of the security forces continued to ill-treat  people,  albeit
    on a reduced scale, and albeit that they  were  more  accountable.   He
    also suggested that the introduction of the Charter has its darker side
    because it also provides immunity not  just  for  terrorists,  but  for
    security services.  [For details of the 'Charter' and the  'Ordonnance'
    see the SIAC judgement in Y]

35.  Dr Seddon was taken to the  US  State  Department  Report  on  Algeria
    (dated 11 March 2008) (at page 20  in  the  respondent's  bundle).   Mr
    Blundell suggested that it should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the
    Amnesty Report.  He asked whether the immunity that was  given  to  the
    security forces referred to what went on in the past, in the 1990s.  Dr
    Seddon accepted  that,  strictly,  the  Charter  referred  to  previous
    violations of human rights but said that the modification of the law in
    2006, to make torture unlawful,  did  not  mean  there  was  no  longer
    impunity in reality.  He acknowledged that progress had been made,  and
    he hoped that things were improving, but said that it was difficult for
    the political authorities  to  penetrate  some  aspects  of  the  state
    apparatus.   He  said  he  was  not  sure  if  the  DRS  was  a   rogue
    organisation, or whether it was deliberately allowed to operate outside
    the rule of law.  He acknowledged that, at least in  theory,  there  is
    now the possibility of redress for victims of torture.

36.  Dr Seddon was asked whether he had seen,  and  incorporated,  the  2007
    and 2008 Amnesty reports before he finished writing his  third  report.
    He said he had seen the 2007 report and should perhaps have included it
    although it said little different from the past.  Mr Blundell suggested
    that there was nothing similar to  the  2007  reference  to  persistent
    reports of torture in the 2008 report.  Dr Seddon said he thought  that
    what Mr Blundell produced was only a summary of the report. (He said it
    was too short to be the full report).  Nevertheless,  there  was  still
    reference to the ongoing use of secret detention.  It was  put  to  him
    that the 2008 report, and the examples given in support, did not  refer
    to torture and indeed one referred to a detainee  being  well  treated.
    Dr Seddon did not consider the latter reference to be of any assistance
    to the respondent.  He said that when read carefully  the  2008  report
    said the detainee's mother had been told by the  police  he  was  being
    well treated,  yet she had  no  idea  where  he  was  being  held.   He
    suggested  that  showed  there  was  still  a  problem  with  the  DRS.
    Mr Blundell suggested that, even if  the  reports  from  Amnesty  were
    summaries, there was no repeat of the words about continuing reports of
    torture in the 2008 version,  Dr Seddon replied that he did not read it
    the same way.  Although the situation was improving, he  said  the  DRS
    remains a real issue.  He referred to  the  November  2007  Country  of
    Origin  Information  Report  ("COIR"),  at  paragraph  8.09,  which  we
    observed refers to a 2006 Amnesty report.  (On the  first  day  of  the
    hearing the parties believed there was no 2008 COIR but that transpired
    to be wrong and it was produced at the adjourned hearing.)    Asked  if
    there were any reports in 2008, similar to the ones  to  which  he  had
    referred from 2007 in his report,  Dr  Seddon  said  that  he  had  not
    expressly referred to any. Those that he had  seen,  continued  to  say
    that torture continues to take place and, although  there  has  been  a
    slight shift in the language, it still continues.  Dr  Seddon  did  not
    think that UNHCR had produced a similar paper since its position  paper
    of 2004.  He had looked for one  because the UNHCR occupy a  privileged
    position and "are less prone to see problems where there are not  any".
    Asked what he meant by that, he said that the UNHCR are less  prone  to
    focus  on  human  rights  abuses,  and  their  reports  carry  a  wider
    perspective, than some others.  He accepted that "a lot  of  water  had
    gone under the bridge" since the UNHCR 2004 Position Paper.

37.   Asked  again  about  the  observations  by  SIAC,  that  torture   was
    declining, Dr Seddon said he had been persuaded that,  in  those  cases
    with  personal  assurances,  the  evidence  has  suggested  that  those
    returned to Algeria had not  been  ill-treated  or  tortured.   But  he
    emphasised this appellant would have no such  personal  assurance.   He
    said that even with assurances there was no  guarantee.   When  he  was
    reminded that the Tribunal does not deal in guaranteed safety, he  said
    that in his view SIAC's confidence was over optimistic although "so far
    so good".  He was reminded that the Commission in BB, paragraph 8,  had
    referred to his bleak conclusions about Algeria  and  Mr  Blundell  was
    asked whether he was  pessimistic.   Dr  Seddon  said  the  observation
    represented  differences  of  interpretation  of  trends  in   Algeria.
    Although he had to accept  that  SIAC  had  been  right  in  regard  to
    assurances, he did not think that his view was any more bleak than  was
    justified.  He said that progress is slow as  regards  improvements  in
    human rights.  He said that another expert (Hugh Roberts) had also been
    described as bleak by the commission. There was a  difference  in  view
    between the two of them and Messrs Layden and Oakden who gave  evidence
    to the Commission but who were involved in the returns process  as  FCO
    employees.   He did not think that the views were as far apart  as  was
    being suggested.

38.  Mr Blundell put to him the difference between this  appellant  and  HS.
    In HS it was perceived  that  the  British  security  services  had  an
    interest in him, whereas there was no evidence of such interest in  the
    appellant either here  or  in  Holland.   He  was  asked  if  that  was
    relevant.  Dr Seddon did not think  it  was,  because  the  cases  were
    different.  The appellant had not been identified in that  way  in  the
    United Kingdom  but  what  is  relevant  is  the  impression  that  the
    appellant will give when he  returns.   Dr Seddon  accepted  that  the
    Algerian authorities would be aware that the asylum system is abused on
    occasion.

39.  In relation to the passage of time since  the  appellant  was  involved
    with  organisations  outside  Algeria,  Dr  Seddon  was  asked  if  the
    involvement was now so remote that it would not be a  problem  for  the
    appellant.  Dr Seddon said it was the period of time that the appellant
    had been out of Algeria, as well as the fact he was in the Middle East.
     The Algerian authorities will want to know  what  he  has  been  doing
    since his time there.  They would be interested to know whether he  has
    maintained his  links  with  the  people  he  met.   It  was  also  not
    irrelevant that he had been backwards and forwards to Europe during the
    1990s.

40.  In re-examination Ms Fielden asked about the significance  of  Peshawar
    and what made the Algerians want the Pakistanis to keep special tabs on
    its citizens.  Dr Seddon said it was the area where Al Qaeda was  being
    established, it was known as the centre of links with Islamic  activity
    and was also the centre of the  Afghan  refugee  camps  that  had  been
    established in the 1980s.  Al Qaeda was set up to assist Arabs fighting
    in Afghanistan.  She asked whether the "water that had flowed under the
    bridge" since the 2004 UNHCR report meant that the appellant was better
    off.  Dr Seddon said that, if  anything,  he  was  probably  worse  off
    because of the rising concern about bombings in Algeria.

41.  Asked by the Tribunal, Dr Seddon said he did not have any evidence  one
    way or the other as to whether the ICRC now  have  access  to  the  DRS
    detention centres (see paragraph 204 of Y).  He did not think there was
    any evidence one way or the other.

Submissions

42.  Both Mr Blundell and Ms  Fielden  made  submissions.   In  addition  Ms
    Fielden submitted a skeleton argument  and  an  "addition  to  skeleton
    argument".  She produced two Amnesty International  reports  which  had
    been handed to her when she visited their offices.   She  had  not  had
    time to consider those reports and both parties were  given  two  weeks
    from the end of the hearing to put in written submissions about them.

Respondent's Submissions

43.  Mr Blundell started by looking at various Special  Immigration  Appeals
    Commission ("SIAC") decisions about  Algeria,  starting  with  Y.   The
    decision was handed down on 24 August 2006.  Mr Blundell  urged  us  to
    take note of the account of the background material that was before the
    Commission and referred to paragraphs 181  to  211,  all  of  which  he
    relied upon.  In particular he relied upon paragraph 341 in  which  the
    Commission said:-

         "The first important feature of the  background  material  is  the
         very large decline in the level of violence of the last few  years:
         the number of deaths is much reduced, and we infer that the same is
         also true of the number of acts of violence resulting  in  injuries
         short of death; terrorist activity  is  no  longer  experienced  in
         urban areas but is confined to the rural or mountainous areas of  a
         very large country; there  have  been  no  disappearances  for  two
         years, and we regard these politically motivated disappearances, on
         whichever side, as a signal of the level of terrorist activity  and
         the ferocity of the response, and their cessation as a sign of  the
         return of peace and stability.  The incidents of  torture  and  its
         severity  is  markedly  declining,  as  is  arbitrary  arrest   and
         detention.  The  response  of  the  security  forces  is  obviously
         affected by the level of the terrorist threat which it  is  dealing
         with thus, as Algeria emerges  from  a  decade  of  civil  war  and
         insurgency, the reducing  level  of  violence  reduces  the  abuses
         committed by the security forces.  The perceived justification  for
         them on both sides diminishes.  This is not a short term reduction.
          It is a settled direction for the evolution of  Algerian  politics
         which reflects war weariness, changes in the outlook of government,
         and a degree of military success against  groups  which  have  lost
         popular support through the atrocities which they  committed."  (Mr
         Blundell's emphasis)


    At paragraph 276  there  was  reference  to  the  evidence  before  the
    Commission as to the release of 2,025 people as a result of the Charter
    and Ordonnance provisions, a reference to 85 people who had surrendered
    themselves and "dozens"  who  had  returned  to  Algeria,  all  at  the
    beginning  of  2006.   Mr  Blundell  suggested  that  the  Charter  and
    Ordonnance (full particulars of which are in the Commission's judgment)
    had benefited the human rights situation generally in Algeria.


44.  He did, however, caution us that this decision  is  now  two  or  three
    years old.  He observed that he was going to criticise  Dr  Seddon  for
    relying on some sources which were two or three  years  old  and  asked
    rhetorically why, if so, he (Mr Blundell) should then be allowed to  do
    so.  The reason is, he said,  that  the  Commission's  view  about  the
    improving  human  rights  situation  in  Algeria  has  been  borne  out
    subsequently.  He observed that in HS Ms Webber, for that appellant was
    critical of the upbeat picture which Y  had  painted  but  Mr  Blundell
    asserted that the  predictions  in  Y  had  been  borne  out  over  the
    following years.

45.  Mr Blundell referred to paragraphs 212 to 218 of  Y  which  dealt  with
    the evidence from Dr Joff�, in particular the Commission considered  Dr
    Joff� to have a view that was too bleak  when  he  had  looked  at  the
    background situation in Algeria at the time.  A different  division  of
    the Commission made a similar observation about Dr  Seddon's  view,  in
    paragraph 8 of BB v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2006]
    UKSIAC 39/2005 (handed down 5 December 2006).  He had produced a report
    for the Commission, dated 13 November 2006, in which he considered that
    the Commission's conclusions in Y were erroneous.  The Commission said:-



        "The bleak conclusion which he draws that it is unsafe to return any
        person  alleged  to  have  been  involved  in  Islamist   extremist
        activities to Algeria - is belied by what has in fact occurred: the
        release of the 2,500  detainees,  including  persons  convicted  of
        terrorist offences committed within Algeria, under the Charter  and
        Ordonnance; the return, on 17 September 2006 of  Rabah  Kebir,  the
        head of the Executive Agency of FIS;  and the return of "I" and "V"
        of  which  more  later,  on  16  and  17  June  2006;  and  at  the
        intergovernmental level, the signature, on 11 July 2006 by the  UK
        and Algeria of  four  Conventions,  on  extradition,  judicial  co-
        operation in civil and  commercial  matters,  the  circulation  and
        readmission of persons and  mutual  legal  assistance  in  criminal
        matters; and President Bouteflika's acknowledgement  and  assurance
        of the Algerian Government's approval of the contents of the  Prime
        Minister's letter of the  same  date.   His  letter  contained  the
        following statement:


              'This exchange of letters underscores the absolute  commitment
             of our two governments to human rights and fundamental freedoms
             ...'


        By  longstanding  Diplomatic  Convention,  President   Bouteflika's
        acknowledgement and approval of a letter  containing  those  words,
        amounts to a commitment on the part of the Algerian  Government  to
        respect those rights."


46.  His next reference  was  to  G  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2007] UKSIAC 2/2005 (handed down on 8 February 2007) where,
    in paragraph 10, the Commission said:-

        "In fact, it has not  been  suggested  on  behalf  of  G  that  the
         relevant parts of the open  generic  ATSCA  judgment  were  or  are
         wrong, and so we  feel  free  to  adopt  them.   It  has  not  been
         suggested that the findings of fact in Y as to changes in  Algerian
         society and the political situation in Algeria were  mistaken,  and
         again we shall adopt them, although we have of course borne in mind
         the differences between G's case and  that  of  Y.   The  principal
         issue in BB was the same as that before us, namely the  reliability
         of the assurances that have been given to the UK Government by  the
         Algerian Government in relation to  G  and  persons  in  a  similar
         position whom the Home Secretary wishes to return to  Algeria.   It
         is of persuasive authority, but we have formed our own view on that
         issue".


    [It is of course the case that this appellant would be returned without
     any assurances]


    It is apparent from both that paragraph, and  paragraph  23,  that  the
    findings in Y were taken as the starting point in G  when  it  came  to
    studying the objective material.  Paragraph 23 of G contained a  number
    of references to paragraphs in Y which Mr Blundell also relied upon.


47.   In  G,  the  Commission  said  there  were  a  number  of   important
    propositions which were not in dispute.  They appear in  paragraph  26.
    The first is that changes in Algerian society have led to  a  reduction
    in torture and other ill-treatment of suspects and  detainees  although
    the Commission noted that:


         "According to an Amnesty International Report of July 2006,  which
         was not disputed, torture and other ill-treatment continued  to  be
         used systematically by the 'military security' (i.e. the DRS).  See
         too the UNHCR position of December 2004".


    Mr Blundell said it was his case that the reference to torture and ill-
     treatment was no longer an appropriate observation.  He  observed  that
     that reference in G was built on the Amnesty  International  Report  of
     2006 and the UNHCR position paper in 2004.  As to the latter, Dr Seddon
     accepted in evidence that a "lot of water had  gone  under  the  bridge
     since then".  Mr Blundell anticipated that Ms  Fielden  would  rely  on
     paragraph 26(d) of G in which it was said  to  be  common  ground  that
     Algerian citizens suspected of terrorism who are  returned  to  Algeria
     would, in the absence of assurances be at  real  risk  of  torture  and
     other ill-treatment.  He argued that this case was not similar to  that
     of G and that the appellant would not be at risk of torture if returned
     without an assurance.  He reminded us that the  personal  circumstances
     of G are to be found  at  paragraphs  11  to  17  of  the  Commission's
     judgment.  He referred in particular to paragraph 14 where it was said,
     "The closed material confirms our view that there is indeed  reasonable
     suspicion that [G] is an international terrorist within the meaning  of
     Section 21 of the ATCSA ...".


48.  Mr Blundell then turned to  U  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2007] UKSIAC SC 32 [2005] which was handed down on  14  May
    2007.  In paragraph 13 the Commission said that  it  was  adopting  the
    findings of the earlier  judgments  and   then  summarised  matters  as
    follows:


         "Algeria is making a  sincere,  broadly  supported  and  generally
         successful  attempt  to  transform   itself   from   a   war   torn
         authoritarian state to a normally functioning civil society; solemn
         diplomatic assurances given by the Algerian State  to  the  British
         Government about individual deportees are reliable and  can  safely
         be accepted".

    He argued that this decision is an important one because it came  after
    the Commission's earlier view had been tested by the return of a number
    of individuals.  Those individuals are referred to in paragraph  14  of
    the judgment and include reference to  "Q"  who  was  returned  without
    assurances.  The Tribunal observed that although Q  did  not  have  the
    benefit of an assurance he was returned very much at the same  time  as
    the others.  He went back to Algeria on 20 January 2007 and the others,
    with assurances, were K on 24  January,  H  on  26  January  and  P  on
    27 January.  In relation to Q, it was said at paragraph 15 of U:


        "He was detained by DRS  Officers.   On  26  January  2007  Amnesty
        International expressed publicly its concern that Q is at  risk  of
        torture."


    There is reference in paragraph 17 of U reporting that Q had heard  the
    screams of other  people  being  tortured,  but  in  paragraph  18  the
    Commission concluded that the statements from a former diplomat who had
    been involved in the  deportation  with  assurances  ("DWA")  programme
    painted a different picture from the evidence which the  appellant  had
    sought to adduce.  It concluded that Q, whilst in detention  was  well,
    but not happy about being detained, and that he had been  treated  with
    respect and not received any inhuman or degrading treatment.  There  is
    reference to the experience in detention of both V and U  who  reported
    that they had found their detention "very hard" but had  not  suggested
    they had been subjected to torture or ill-treatment.  One of  them  had
    subsequently enquired about obtaining a new Algerian passport.


49.  Mr Blundell considered that paragraph 37(ii) of U  was  important  when
    considering Dr Seddon's evidence.  There it is said that:

        "The Algerian State has fulfilled to the letter those parts of  its
         assurances to the British  Government  which  can  be  conclusively
         verified...".


    The Commission also said, at paragraph 37(iii):


         "It is necessary to obtain  such  assurances  in  relation  to  an
         individual deportee for his  safety  on  return  to  be  reasonably
         assured".


    Mr Blundell anticipated that Ms Fielden would rely on that and asked us
     to treat the assertion with a broad brush approach and look  at  it  in
     the context of the SIAC cases.

50.  He then referred to paragraph 40, in which the Commission said:-

        "It cannot sensibly be claimed that there is a  consistent  pattern
         of gross and systematic violation of  the  rights  which  could  be
         guaranteed by Article 3 if Algeria  were  a  Convention  State,  of
         prisoners detained pending trial for offences, including  terrorist
         offences".


    He argued that this was in line with the current evidence  and  broadly
     supported by Dr Seddon's evidence.

51.  The next authority was Y, BB and U, handed down  on  2  November  2007.
    Mr Blundell asserted that this was an important case, heard on remittal
    from the Court of Appeal.  He said it was not considered, so far as  he
    was able to tell, in HS, and concerned safety on  return.    He  argued
    that Dr Seddon had suggested that the DRS is  a  law  unto  itself  but
    mentioned that in paragraph 10 of Y, BB and U the Commission said:

         "We much prefer and accept the view of Mr Layden that he has  seen
         no evidence of lack of support  by  any  element  of  the  Algerian
         Executive, including  the  armed  forces,  for  the  reconciliation
         process."


    It is perhaps important to note, as Ms Fielden was to say  later,  that
     at paragraph 7 the Commission said:-


        "We accept that the Executive is the most powerful  element  within
         the Algerian Polity; that  the  armed  services  and  the  DRS  are
         independent political actors like, for  example,  the  military  in
         Turkey".


    Ms Fielden was  to  argue  that,  the  way  in  which  paragraph  7  is
     expressed, casts doubt as to whether the Commission was  including  the
     DRS as part of  the  armed  services  in  paragraph  10.   Mr  Blundell
     referred to the Commission's conclusions, at  paragraph  22,  that  the
     policy of peace and reconciliation and national consensus had been  put
     under strain but had held.  The Commission said the Algerian state  had
     not responded in an authoritarian or  lawless  manner.   Reported  ill-
     treatment, by the DRS, of persons in their custody  had  not  increased
     and that there had only been two instances that the Commission referred
     to.  He argued that this passage bore out that the Algerian  State  was
     no longer adopting a policy  of  biting  back  and  that,  despite  the
     fluctuations there, the state has not resorted  to  ill-treatment.   In
     paragraph 28 of Y, BB and U there is reference to there  being  nothing
     in Y's circumstances which would increase the risk of torture  or  ill-
     treatment  to  the  level  at  which  that  became  a  real  risk.   He
     acknowledged that there is  reference  to  risk  both  in  the  Amnesty
     International 2008 Report, and by Dr Seddon, but he reminded us that it
     was for us to assess the risk.  He argued that any risk was not a  real
     risk.

52.  Finally, in relation to the SIAC cases he referred to  PP  v  Secretary
    of State for the Home Department [2007] UKSIAC 54/2006, handed down  on
    23 November 2007.  He said this post-dated HS  and  still  followed  Y.
    The Commission  observed  that  neither  Counsel  before  it  made  any
    submissions in relation to the general situation in Algeria  which  had
    not already been considered by SIAC.  That showed that Y, BB and U  was
    still correct at that date.

53.  Mr Blundell then turned to HS and said that  it  is  a  decision  which
    should be treated with some caution.  He said that because he  regarded
    it as being based on some old material and reminded us that  Dr  Seddon
    had accepted that a lot of water had gone under the bridge  since  that
    older material was published. There was reference in paragraph  21,  to
    the 2004 UNHCR position paper.  There was reference at paragraph 22  to
    Dr Joff�'s report which had referred to the wide practice of torture of
    those suspected of membership of dissident groups; and  to  Dr Joff�'s
    view that, notwithstanding the proposals  by  President  Bouteflika  to
    introduce a spirit of national conciliation, there was still the  clear
    view that "throat cutters could not be forgiven,  i.e.  extremists  and
    those accused of contacts with terrorism".  Mr Blundell said this  went
    in the opposite direction from the decisions in SIAC by  whom  his  (Dr
    Joff�'s) assessment had been characterised as bleak.

54.  He argued that Ms Webber's  submissions  (in  HS)  had  been  generally
    accepted by the Tribunal.  She was recorded as having argued  that  "it
    was inherently unlikely that Algeria  would  liberalise  its  laws  and
    practices at a time when terrorism was  worsening".   He  argued  again
    that this went broadly contrary to the SIAC findings.  He  referred  to
    paragraph 123 in which there was  reference  to  the  DRS  acting  with
    uncontrolled brutality, which he argued appeared to have  been  reached
    without considering the broad improvements and the  amount  of  torture
    perpetrated by the  DRS.  He referred to Y, BB  and  U  (paragraph  22)
    where there were only the two identifiable examples  of  such  torture.
    He said that HS was unusual in a Country Guidance Case in that  it  did
    not have an index and so it was not possible to  see  the  age  of  the
    material that was considered.

55.  He also argued that there was  an  error  in  the  Tribunal's  approach
    because, at paragraphs 121 and 122 there are references  to  guarantees
    of safety.  He acknowledged that in  paragraph  122  of  HS  there  was
    reference to some evidence of ongoing malpractice by  the  DRS  but  he
    argued that, in reality,  that  did  not  result  in  a  real  risk  of
    prohibited ill-treatment to this appellant.  He argued  that  paragraph
    104 of HS contained the correct test; that is whether "his profile will
    cause the  Algerian  authorities  to  view  him  as  being  of  current
    operational value/interest".  Obviously, it is necessary, if the answer
    is yes, to ask if there is a real risk of ill-treatment.   Mr Blundell
    argued that the appellant's profile was nothing like  as  high  as  the
    profile of HS, which was detailed in paragraph 107.  The  appellant  in
    HS had been accused in the national press,  including  the  BBC,  of  a
    fraud:

        "which detectives feared  was  being  used  to  fund  international
         terrorism".


    That was not  the  case  here  and  he  argued  that  this  appellant's
     relationship with doubtful organisations was a great  deal  longer  ago
     than HS's possible involvement.

56.  He then turned to Dr Seddon's evidence.  He  said  Dr  Seddon  had  not
    given evidence at most  of  the  SIAC  hearings  or  HS.   Mr  Blundell
    accepted that he takes a proper interest in  Algeria  and  monitors  it
    closely.  He accepted that he was a proper expert and has been prepared
    to accept  the  shortcomings  in  his  report  put  to  him  in  cross-
    examination (ante).  But, he was described by SIAC in BB  as  having  a
    bleak approach and Mr Blundell asserted that he  is  pessimistic  about
    Algeria.  Dr Seddon readily accepted that he errs on  the  'down  side'
    when making his assessments.  Dr Seddon's acceptance that he  had  been
    corrected about the safety on return with assurances could be  said  to
    bear out that his earlier  pessimism  was  unfounded.   Dr  Seddon  had
    suggested that SIAC was unduly optimistic and over confident about  the
    future but accepted it now appears that they were realistic.

57.  Turning to  the  three  reports  which  were  before  us,  Mr  Blundell
    referred to paragraph 2.32 of the second report, where it  is  apparent
    that  Dr  Seddon  predicated  his  opinion  on  the  veracity  of   the
    appellant's account, whereas the cause as advanced by the appellant  is
    now different.  In the third report, he said Dr Seddon  suggested  that
    it is the appellant's links with the organisations abroad, and not  the
    fact that he claimed to have been told by the Algerian  authorities  in
    Yemen that he was a wanted man in  Algeria,   that  are  relevant.   In
    arguing that Dr Seddon had  accepted  his  shortcomings  during  cross-
    examination,  Mr  Blundell  mentioned  that  he  had  referred  to  the
    activities of the Arab militia (the Afghan Arabs) at paragraph  3.7  of
    his report and in his Annex at  1.3.   However,  when  asked  what  had
    happened to the 3,000 Algerians who were said to have been involved, he
    had to accept he had conducted no research into that, and also accepted
    that it was an important, and relevant, issue.  Mr Blundell argued that
    another shortcoming was the fact that the appellant's work for  Islamic
    charities was part of his profile but, when Dr  Seddon  was  asked  for
    examples of anyone else who had  worked  for  such  charities,  he  was
    unable to point to anyone who had had difficulties  as  a  result.   He
    said that he had checked and not found anything despite the  fact  that
    there were up to 3,000 Algerians in the area of Pakistan, and a flow of
    them returning, at around the time that Al Qaeda was being set up.

58.  His last point was that, in the third report, Dr Seddon  made  comments
    about impunity which he now accepted were incorrect.  In paragraphs 4.1
    to 4.5 he echoed the concerns of Amnesty International and Human Rights
    Watch about that.   But, when  he  was  referred  to  page  20  of  the
    objective evidence, part of the US State Department Report, he  had  to
    accept that there was now a legal provision for the punishment of those
    who perpetrate torture.  He also accepted that SIAC  had  spoken  of  a
    marked decline in that activity and accepted that was correct.  He  had
    not been able to find recent sources  reporting  widespread  persistent
    and systematic use of torture and, although the references in paragraph
    5.5 of his report refer to that, the section needs to be seen in  light
    of the fact he now accepts there is no evidence  of  its  continuation.
    When he was  being  cross-examined  he  was  referred  to  the  Amnesty
    International 2008 report.  It was put to him that that only said there
    was some risk that  those  in  DRS  detention  may  be  tortured.   His
    response was to say that there was no guarantee that they would not be.
     Mr Blundell asserted that that was not the correct test.  In  summary,
    he argued that the burden was on the appellant, who was unable to  show
    that he would be  of  current  operational  interest  to  the  Algerian
    Executive and that there was no evidence that his involvement with  the
    charities years ago would demonstrate any risk.  He  also  argued  that
    there was no evidence that the Dutch or the UK  authorities  had  shown
    any interest in those activities.  There is no evidence  to  show  that
    simply making an asylum claim abroad generates a real risk  of  serious
    ill-treatment.   Even  if  the  appellant  were  of  interest  to   the
    authorities, given the marked decline in torture and ill-treatment, and
    even if he was detained by the DRS, there is not a real  risk  that  he
    would be subject to serious ill-treatment.

Ms Fielden's Submissions

59.  In replying to  Mr  Blundell,  Ms  Fielden  dealt  first  with  to  his
    reference to Y  and  the  assertion  that  incidents  of  torture  were
    declining.  She referred to the date of Y, and said that Dr Seddon had
    made it clear when he was giving evidence that  there  was  an  air  of
    optimism in 2004 to 2006 because the Algerians thought  that  they  had
    control  of  terrorism,  and  therefore  conditions   were   improving.
    Mr Blundell had linked the Y finding to the observations that both  Dr
    Joff� and Dr Seddon had been said to be bleak but,  she  reminded  us,
    SIAC was focused on assurances.  Dr Seddon seems to have accepted that,
    in general, there has been positive progress by Algeria, and it  was  a
    welcome development that the assurances had so far protected those  who
    had returned.  She argued that Dr Seddon was  right  when  he  accepted
    that one can produce problems by being over sceptical,  but  said  that
    one can also get things wrong by being over optimistic.  He  was  bleak
    from the point of view of wishing to protect those who were  returning,
    and at a time when it was too soon to know whether the assurances would
    work.  Referring to paragraph 8 of BB, and the reference to the release
    of terrorists, Miss Fielden reminded us that Dr Seddon had  said  that
    Algeria was less concerned about indigenous  terrorists  now,  and  was
    more  concerned  with  people  who  were  involved   in   international
    terrorism.  Referring to the finding of the Commission in paragraph  23
    of G, that there had been important social, political and legal changes
    in Algeria, she reminded us  that  although  Y  had  been  the  correct
    starting point, conditions had reverted back to some  extent;  that  we
    were now in 2009 with all that had happened in international  terrorism
    since 2007.  Dr Seddon had said in his 2009 report that  matters  would
    probably be worse now, for the appellant, than they would have been two
    years ago.

60.  Turning to paragraph 26(b) of G she argued  that  the  reference  to  a
    reduction in torture was accepted by Dr Seddon,  but  his  concern  was
    that there is still  enough  for  there  to  be  a  real  risk  to  the
    appellant.  What  Dr  Seddon  said  is  that  the  appellant  would  be
    questioned by the authorities at the airport and it  would  rapidly  be
    realised that there had been an international aspect to his  activities
    and, that with his travels abroad, he would quickly be  transferred  to
    the DRS.  Dr Seddon had highlighted  the  secret  detention  facilities
    which were not accessible to external monitoring.

61.  She then turned to the 2004 UNHCR Report and the  fact  Dr  Seddon  had
    said a lot of water had gone under the bridge since then.  She asserted
    that the water ebbed and flowed.  Things had not only got better.   She
    was anxious to  remind  us  that  the  SIAC  cases  almost  exclusively
    involved  people  who  would  be  returning  with   assurances   and/or
    monitoring by the British Embassy but neither of those advantages  were
    open to this appellant.  Dr Seddon had not agreed with the  proposition
    that the appellant would be better off  without  an  assurance  on  the
    basis that meant he had a less high profile.  That is because it  would
    be necessary to interrogate the appellant in order to find out what  he
    had been doing, and  the  DRS  have  carte  blanche  if  there  are  no
    assurances.

62.  Turning to the reference in paragraph 14 of G, to someone perceived  as
    an international terrorist, Ms Fielden argued that it is  exactly  what
    the appellant is likely to be suspected of because  of  his  movements,
    and  the  organisations  and  people  he  had  worked  with,  and   the
    possibility that he had maintained links with them.  She argued that it
    was the suspicion of those links to international terrorism which would
    be in the mind of the authorities.  Referring to  paragraph  13  of  U,
    where it was suggested that Algeria is making sincere broadly supported
    and generally successful attempts to transform itself, she argued  that
    Dr Seddon accepted that, but his view was that the country had not  got
    to its destination yet.  She said that  what  really  matters  is  what
    would happen in practice, not what the country aspires to.  She  picked
    up the point that Q, who was returned without assurances, and  who  was
    referred to in U, was returned almost as part of  a  group.   The  fact
    that others who were returned at about the same  time  and  were  being
    watched, and did have the  protection  of  assurances,  may  well  have
    afforded Q some protection.

63.  Paragraph 17 of U gave  details  of  where  U  had  been  (Afghanistan,
    Switzerland, Greece and London).  She argued  that  the  appellant  had
    actually travelled more widely and had worked with some known suspected
    organisations.  She argued that the appellant's profile is  unique  and
    would ring alarm bells which would give rise to the authorities wanting
    to know if he had kept up his links.

64.  Referring to U, paragraph 40, where the Commission said that  it  could
    not sensibly be claimed that there is a pattern of gross and systematic
    violation of the rights of those prisoners detained pending trial,  she
    asserted that was not the appellant's case.  He would  not  necessarily
    be detained pending trial, his concern is what would happen to  him  at
    the preceding stage when investigations were being carried out.

65.  Returning to Y, BB and U, at paragraph 10, she questioned  whether  the
    Commission's acceptance of Mr Leydon's evidence did in  fact  refer  to
    the DRS.  She said that because of the point recorded in Mr  Blundell's
    submissions about the reference in paragraph, 7.  She reminded  us,  in
    relation to paragraph 22, that Dr Seddon's concerns  were  about  those
    viewed as being involved with  international  terrorism,  not  domestic
    terrorism, and it  is  international  terrorism  that  has  caused  the
    authorities tighten their security, seeking those who have links abroad
    in places such as Pakistan.

66.  Turning to the 2008 Amnesty International Report,  she  said  that  the
    report did not say there was no  longer  a  risk  of  ill-treatment  or
    torture, indeed it referred to an existing risk.   Dr  Seddon  accepted
    things were better, but said that they had not resolved completely.

67.  Dealing with HS, at paragraph 123, and the criticised observation  that
    the DRS has been known to act with "uncontrolled brutality",  she  said
    that showed the general improvement did not mean the appellant was  not
    at risk.  She accepted that refugee law does not  deal  in  guarantees,
    but suggested that the Tribunal in HS were saying that the  fact  there
    is no guarantee a person will be safe is the same as saying that  there
    is some risk.  The standard of proof then governs how that is assessed.
     Dealing with some of the alleged shortcomings in Dr Seddon's evidence,
    Ms Fielden said she did not understand why he was criticised about  the
    3,000 people who were said to have been with the Afghan Arabs.  At  the
    time that those 3,000 were identified Algeria had not really been aware
    of the rising problems.  It was only at the later  election,  when  the
    Islamists appeared to have won,  that  the  authorities  became  really
    concerned.  Referring to  Mr  Blundell's  description  of  Dr  Seddon's
    evidence having shortcomings, in the sense that there were no  examples
    of what had happened to those 3,000 people, she pointed out  that  this
    appellant had not just worked for one charity but several.   She  again
    emphasised his unique profile having worked for what she described as a
    "plethora of 'iffy' organisations".  Dr Seddon had  never  come  across
    anyone with an equivalent background to the  appellant.   She  referred
    then to the fact that there  is  now  legal  provision  making  torture
    illegal in Algeria.  She emphasised that that was of little concern  to
    the appellant because he was interested in  what  actually  happens  in
    practice.  She argued that it  is  not  unreasonable  to  suggest  that
    somebody was acting with impunity when the reality  is  that  they  can
    misbehave as long as "no one was looking".  She argued that Mr Blundell
    was wrong to say there was no reason why the appellant would be of  any
    operational interest now because his activities were so long  ago;  the
    authorities do not know whether he had maintained his earlier links and
    they do not know what he had been doing during his years in the  United
    Kingdom and Holland.  The fact that the charities for which  he  worked
    are fronts for terrorist organisations,  and  some  are  now  terrorist
    organisations themselves, is enough to flag up cause for concern by the
    authorities.  The fact there had been no interest by the Dutch  and  UK
    authorities (so far as we are aware) does not mean  the  Algerians  may
    not express an interest.

68.  In her skeleton Ms Fielden reminded us that the  appellant  had  worked
    for a number of Islamic organisations in countries regarded as  hotbeds
    of Islamic  radicalism  such  as  Pakistan,  Saudi  Arabia  and  Yemen.
    Although the organisations included schools, Afghan refugee  camps  and
    Islamic charities there is a general belief  that  those  organisations
    are conduits for funding of terrorist groups.  There was  reference  in
    Dr Seddon's reports to the precise identity of those organisations and
    what is thought about them, not by just Algeria.  Even the  appellant's
    journeys  to  France  were  at  a  time  when  Islamist   groups   were
    establishing themselves there.   When  he  was  in  Sierra  Leone,  the
    organisation the appellant was working for was an Islamic charity based
    in Kuwait.  To the  extent  that  the  evidence  was  accepted  by  the
    Immigration Judge, there  was  a  suggestion  that  the  appellant  had
    expressed anti-establishment views at the mosque in Algeria  before  he
    left in 1991.  She argued that his two asylum claims abroad could  only
    add to the Algerian authorities' suspicions.  The evidence was that the
    appellant's brother had been questioned about his whereabouts  and  was
    later shot dead by a  gendarme,  and  that  the  appellant's  wife  had
    problems leaving Algeria having returned there after they had  married.
    It is said she was asked about the appellant's whereabouts and  it  was
    suggested that he learned the Algerian authorities had a file on him.

69.  In her  skeleton  she  argued  that,  although  the  Immigration  Judge
    rejected the appellant's claim to have been wanted in Algeria,  he  did
    not actually reject the evidence that the Algerian Secret Service had a
    dossier about him.  The  skeleton  also  argued  that  the  appellant's
    wife's evidence was not expressly disbelieved save to the  extent  that
    the Immigration Judge found her account was  not  compatible  with  the
    appellant being wanted.  The skeleton asserts that Dr Seddon  had  said
    in his earlier report (which was before the Immigration Judge) that the
    evidence suggested (or even strongly indicated) that both the appellant
    and his wife had been blacklisted by the Algerian  authorities  because
    of their stay in Pakistan.  It did not appear the Immigration Judge had
    taken that into account.  The skeleton also argued that the Immigration
    Judge did not  make  any  finding  about  Dr  Seddon's  view  that  the
    appellant's motive for travelling was economic betterment.  Ms  Fielden
    asserted that the Immigration Judge did not  disbelieve  the  essential
    ingredients  of  the  appellant's  claim  and  concluded  her  skeleton
    argument by suggesting that with the  appellant's  particular  accepted
    history he would be viewed with great suspicion by the  authorities  on
    return, that he would at least be suspected of links with international
    terrorism and would therefore be at serious risk of  ill-treatment  and
    torture during interrogation and thereafter.

70.  In her "addition to the skeleton", prepared after the first day of  the
    hearing she again emphasised that the real risk is that  the  appellant
    will be questioned on arrival  in  Algeria.   Given  the  interrogation
    methods likely to be used he would reveal sufficient to warrant further
    detention.  Dr Seddon had thought it most likely that the DRS would  be
    involved because of their interest in matters other than internal ones.
     Much of the material in the addition to the skeleton was covered by Ms
    Fielden in her response to Mr Blundell's submissions.  She  dealt  with
    the difference in wording between the Amnesty International Reports  of
    2007 and 2008, in particular Dr Seddon's observation  that  the  later
    report refers to a woman being told by the Judicial Police that her son
    was being well treated by the DRS, and that in the next sentence it was
    said to be unclear where her son  was  being  held.   She  argued  that
    Dr Seddon's message is a simple one, things are improving  in  Algeria
    but have not improved to the extent that the DRS no  longer  uses  ill-
    treatment and torture to which there is a real risk the appellant  will
    be subject.  She argued that the fact there is  now  available  redress
    for those who suffer inhuman or degrading treatment  or  torture,  does
    not help because that redress would only happen after the event and was
    not much protection.

71.  Her skeleton dealt with the differences as Dr Seddon saw  them  between
    the facts in HS and the appellant.  He considered the factors were very
    different, because in HS press coverage identified HS  as  a  terrorist
    suspect, whereas in this case it was his long period abroad.  He was of
    the view that the appellant would not  be  treated  as  an  "old  case"
    because of the current international terrorist threat, and because  any
    maintained links would  be  highly  significant  in  the  eyes  of  the
    Algerian authorities.  She reminded us that  Peshawar  is  known  as  a
    centre of terrorist links and that is  where  the  appellant  had  been
    working.

72.  She reminded us that even if the organisations  were  benign  when  the
    appellant was working for them  that is not  particularly  relevant  if
    they have now become known for their terrorist activities.  Their names
    alone would be sufficient to cause interest in the appellant.

73.  The skeleton emphasised that the Immigration Judge did  not  appear  to
    have taken into account parts of Dr Seddon's earlier  report,  and  the
    suggestion that the appellant had  been  blacklisted  by  the  Algerian
    authorities.  Ms Fielden  suggested  that  undermined  the  Immigration
    Judge's conclusion about the interest of the  Algerian  authorities  in
    the past.  But the skeleton went on to say  that  it  was  Dr  Seddon's
    clear view that the risk on return does not so depend on  past  issues,
    because the risk would  be  triggered  by  his  detention  followed  by
    inevitable interrogation following disclosure of his suspicious history
    abroad.  She reminded us that Dr Seddon did not want  to  be  tied  too
    closely to the case of HS because there  are  differences  as  well  as
    similarities between the appellant and HS.  She emphasised  again  that
    the  appellant  had  not  only  worked  for  a  number  of   suspicious
    organisations but his work took him to a number  of  countries  all  of
    which were of special concern so far as terrorism was concerned, namely
    Pakistan, Yemen and Saudi Arabia.  She said it is perhaps  unsurprising
    that Dr Seddon had been able to find anybody with a similar background.
     He had observed that one does not hear about them until  they  surface
    in a court system.  He said that in his fifteen  years'  work  in  this
    area he has not come across anyone with a profile like  this  where  an
    appellant has worked for a series of charities in such  key  countries.
    Finally, the addition  to  the  skeleton  explained  that  the  Amnesty
    Reports produced at the hearing were complete reports. When she  called
    at Amnesty to make enquiries about them, Ms Fielden was  provided  with
    two further documents which we gave to both  parties  to  make  written
    submissions within two weeks from 12 February.

Submissions on Late Documents

74.  We received written submissions from both  sides  on  the  two  Amnesty
    documents produced by Ms Fielden at the final hearing.  The first  was
    Amnesty International's  "Submissions  to  the  UN  Universal  Periodic
    Review" and was dated 28 November 2007.  The other was  their  briefing
    to the Committee Against Torture dated 17  April  2008.   In  order  to
    assess these documents it is important to appreciate their purpose  and
    the period with which they dealt.  Mr Blundell had  analysed  that  and
    made the following submissions  about  the  documents.   We  adopt  his
    shorthand to describe the documents as the "AI submission" and the  "AI
    briefing".  The earlier document,  the  AI  submission,  was  Amnesty's
    input into a Universal Periodic Review carried out by the Human  Rights
    Council, a body set up by the UN General Assembly.  Mr Blundell pointed
    out in his submission that the  AI  submission  does  not  contain  any
    indication as to the period which it is  intended  to  cover.   He  had
    therefore obtained a fact  sheet  from  the  United  Nations  which  he
    submitted, and which dealt with the Universal  Periodic  Review.   That
    fact sheet showed that the process is carried out under the auspices of
    the Human Rights Council and looks at the human rights records  of  all
    192 Member States of the United Nations  once  every  four  years.   He
    submitted that the AI submission was not  specifically  directed  to  a
    particular reporting period and that it appeared, from the text of  the
    submissions,  that it had not sought to confine itself to any  specific
    period.  It included express references to a "body of  evidence"  about
    activities of the DRS in the 1990s.

75.  It is the case that the Universal Periodic  Review  was  set  up  by  a
    resolution of the  UN  General  Assembly  dated  March  2006  with  the
    intention that the human rights  records  of  every  country  would  be
    reviewed by 2011 with a review thereafter of  each  member  state  once
    every four years.  the AI submission  was  in  relation  to  the  first
    review.

76.  As to the  AI  briefing,  Mr  Blundell  submitted  that  this  document
    contained Amnesty's submissions to the Committee Against Torture  which
    was considering its third Period Report about Algeria.  Although the AI
    briefing itself does not refer to  the  period  covered  by  the  third
    Period Report, Mr Blundell had obtained a copy of it.  It  is  apparent
    that the report covers the period November 1996 to  January  2006.   He
    supposed that the AI briefing covered the  same  period  and  drew  our
    attention to the fact that it deals with enforced disappearances during
    the 1990s but also refers the reader to previous Amnesty  International
    reports for further information.  He asked  us  to  consider  that  the
    briefing summarised Amnesty's concerns throughout the reporting  period
    and was not simply a review of the current situation.   We  are  by  no
    means satisfied that his analysis of the period covered by the document
    is correct.  The copy of the third  Periodic  Report  produced  by  the
    Committee Against Torture, under the auspices of the United Nations, is
    dated 10 February 2006,  whereas  the  copy  of  the  Amnesty  briefing
    appears to have been embargoed until 17 April 2008.  The briefing paper
    cannot have been intended as input for the third Periodic Report.   The
    introduction to the AI briefing indicates that  it  was  submitted  for
    reconsideration by the Committee Against Torture during the  course  of
    its "fourth .... examination of Algeria's third Periodic  Report".   We
    take it therefore that the  briefing  was  intended  to  build  on  the
    committee's report and bring it more up-to-date.  That is apparent from
    the material in the AI briefing some, but by no  means  all  of  which,
    post dates the committee's report.  The case studies included in the AI
    briefing include a number of events in 2007, but also  deportations  to
    Algeria by the United Kingdom  since  2006,  including  Q  and  H.   Mr
    Blundell asked us to consider the documents as a summary  of  Amnesty's
    concerns throughout the reporting period rather than a  review  of  the
    current position.  In doing  so  he  reminded  us  that  references  to
    torture  being  "widespread  or  systematic"  in  DRS   detention   had
    disappeared from the 2008 Amnesty report, having been previously in the
    2007 report.

77.  He also produced the September 2008 COIR on Algeria but  did  not  wish
    to make any submissions on it.   He also confirmed that he did not wish
    to make any submissions following RB (Algeria) and OO (Jordan)  v  SSHD
    [2009] UKHL 10, which  was  handed  down  after  the  hearing  of  this
    reconsideration had been concluded.

78.  In her submissions Ms Fielden acknowledged that the Amnesty  submission
    referred to the level of violence having decreased by  comparison  with
    the 1990s, but drew our attention to the fact that it still  maintained
    that DRS continues to be  responsible  for  secret  detentions  and  to
    commit torture with impunity.  It said the barracks  used  by  DRS  for
    detentions are not inspected by bodies  independent  of  the  military.
    She referred to the fact that detainees are  often  forced  to  sign  a
    report containing a confession, which also contained a declaration that
    they had been well treated.  She said it is known  that  detainees  are
    threatened by DRS officials and told that they should not disclose  how
    they were treated.  She submitted that, even  if  they  do,  complaints
    about torture or ill treatment are not investigated and the perpetrator
    is not held accountable.  There was criticism in the submission at page
    2 of the Charter  adopted  in  2006,  which  declared  that  complaints
    against security forces would be inadmissible in court.   She  asserted
    that  the  result  has  been  to  confer  complete  immunity  for   the
    perpetrators of human rights abuses.  However, we do  not  accept  that
    the Charter has had that effect for all allegations.  The provision was
    regarded as a balance for the amnesty provided to citizens and,  it  is
    clear from paragraph 344 of  Y  v  SSHD,  that  the  immunity  for  the
    security services related to past acts.  The Commission in Y recognised
    the shortcomings of the Charter and explained some of the  reasons  for
    them.  Ms Fielden  asserted  that  the  report  suggested  there  is  a
    continued a risk of torture  and  other  ill-treatment  if  a  person's
    background is such that the security forces would wish to  interrogate.



79.  As to the Amnesty briefing, there is further reference to impunity  for
    past violations but Ms Fielden referred to  references  throughout  the
    report to  serious  human  rights  abuses  having  decreased,  save  in
    relation to counter-terrorism measures where torture and  ill-treatment
    continue to be committed.  She referred to the treatment of one  Ikhlef
    as an example of a conviction based solely on a statement  made  during
    incommunicado custody of the DRS.  The Ikhlef case was  dealt  with  at
    paragraph 313 of Y.  She emphasised that the report stressed,  at  page
    19, that the purpose of any torture or other ill-treatment was  largely
    to extract information or confessions  about  international  terrorism.
    She gave as an example of a  detainee  complaining  he  had  been  ill-
    treated and forced to sign an interrogation report, without reading it,
    that of Mohammed Benyamima (dealt with in Y at paragraph 309).

80.  In relation to Q, who was one of those deported  with  assurances  (and
    referred to in paragraphs 13 to 19 of U v SSHD),  the  report  suggests
    that Q, contrary to what had been recorded in U, had  been  ill-treated
    in DRS detention  and  that  there  had  been  no  investigation.   She
    summarised her submissions by saying the new  material  confirms  that,
    notwithstanding the general reduction in the level of torture and  ill-
    treatment of detainees, the DRS continues to be responsible for  secret
    detentions and continues to commit torture with impunity in the context
    of counter terrorism.

Conclusions

81.  In considering the appeal we have had  regard  to  the  fact  that  the
    burden of proof is on the  appellant  and  the  standard  of  proof  is
    'reasonable likelihood' or 'real risk'.

82.  We set out here a brief summary  of  the  appellant's  movements  since
    first leaving Algeria.  We  accept  the  unchallenged  evidence  of  Dr
    Seddon as to the identity and significance  of  the  organisations  and
    places the appellant worked for, and in.  They are as  follows.   After
    completing his military service the appellant, a schoolteacher,  claims
    to have gone to Pakistan to assist with teaching Afghan refugees on the
    Afghan/Pakistani border.  He was there for ten  months  from  September
    1989 teaching Arabic and living in Rawalpindi.  The  organisation  that
    he was employed by for some seven months, the Social Reform Society, is
    described as an Islamic charitable organisation based in Kuwait.  It is
    one of fifteen organisations listed by  the  Russian  Government  as  a
    terrorist  organisation,  albeit  that  the  Russians  did  not  become
    interested in the  organisation's  activities  in  Moscow  until  2002.
    Still in Pakistan, he then went to Peshawar when he either continued to
    work for the same organisation or the World Islamic Relief Organisation
    based in Jeddah.  The latter organisation is said to be the operational
    arm of the Muslim World League, an organisation founded by  the  people
    who later founded Al Qaeda.  One of the  September  11  2001  hijackers
    worked for that organisation in the United States.  The period when the
    appellant was in Pakistan was roughly when Al Qaeda was started, having
    emerged from the training camps for Arabs wishing  to  fight  with  the
    Mujahedeen.

83.  In 1991, having first been to Mecca, the appellant went to Yemen  where
    he taught in Ibb and then Sana'a.  Little is known  about  who  he  was
    working for in Yemen, only that he was there  until  1993  teaching  in
    primary schools.

84.  After travelling again to Saudi Arabia in April  1993,  he  married  an
    Algerian woman in Jeddah where he had remained for approximately  seven
    months.  According to Dr Seddon, it was during that period  that  Osama
    bin Laden, having returned to Saudi Arabia, was attempting to launch  a
    struggle against the US military presence.

85.  In 1993 the appellant returned with his wife to Pakistan in 1993  where
    he remained for nine months teaching in refugee  camps  for  the  Tamir
    organisation.  Dr Seddon described the Tamir organization as an Islamic
    charitable organisation based in Kuwait.  He said it  could  easily  be
    confused with a Pakistani organisation with a similar name and which is
    on  the  United  States'  Terrorist  Exclusion  list  as  a   terrorist
    organisation.  He did not say whether, in reality, there  is  any  link
    between the two organisations.  The appellant  went  back  to  Pakistan
    because his job in Yemen had been terminated in his  absence.   It  was
    during this period that it is said that the Government of  Algeria  had
    asked for all Algerians in the border  region  to  return  to  Algeria.
    Because of his concerns about that request the appellant went  back  to
    Yemen in September 1993 and remained there until  1995.   We  were  not
    told for whom the appellant was  working  in  Yemen  on  this  occasion
    either, but Dr Seddon observed that it  was  during  this  period  that
    Islamic fundamentalism was on the rise in Yemen.  The  appellant  again
    says that he was teaching.  At the end of that  period  the  appellant,
    having said that he had failed to obtain a  renewal  of  his  passport,
    forged a new expiry date in it and went to  Sierra  Leone.   There,  he
    worked for the Safa Group which was described by Dr Seddon as a complex
    coalition of overlapping companies registered in Northern Virginia  and
    controlled by known individuals who have shown support  for  terrorists
    and terrorist front organisations.  The appellant said  he  left  Yemen
    because residents who had been to Pakistan  were  being  arrested.   In
    Sierra Leone he worked for Africa  Muslims  Agency  doing  poor  relief
    work.  He left Sierra Leone in  1996  before  the  false  date  in  his
    passport was reached but was  arrested  in  Amsterdam  because  it  was
    noticed that he had tampered with the passport.  He then unsuccessfully
    claimed asylum, but, when he was faced with removal  to  either  Sierra
    Leone or Algeria in 2003, he came  to  the  United  Kingdom  and  again
    claimed asylum.

86.  During the period back in Algeria, after his first visit  to  Pakistan,
    the appellant travelled to France on more than one  occasion.   He  has
    mostly been out of Algeria since 1989, save for the brief  period  when
    he returned after the first Pakistan trip.  He has therefore  been  out
    of the country for nearly twenty years.

87.  The appellant claims that the reason for his travelling was  employment
    and economic betterment.  Dr Seddon has, as  we  have  recorded,  dealt
    with the increase in Islamic fundamentalism in Algeria throughout  this
    period and  more  recently  the  Algerian's  change  of  emphasis  from
    internal terrorism to international terrorism.

88.  Following the decision in IK v SSHD [2004] UKIAT 00312 we  must  assume
    that the appellant would not be expected to lie  when  he  returned  to
    Algeria and therefore that this history would quickly become  known  to
    the Algerian authorities.

89.  Dr Seddon has said that the Algerian authorities  would  be  interested
    to know, not only what the appellant had been doing in the Middle East,
    but also what he had been doing during his time in Holland and the  UK,
    and whether he had maintained any contact with those he had met in  the
    past.  It was Dr Seddon's  view  that  niceties  such  as  whether  the
    organisations for which the appellant worked, and which have since been
    identified with terrorism, were involved in those activities  when  the
    appellant worked for them would not assist him.  Dr Seddon's  argument,
    which we accept, is that his profile would give  rise  to  considerable
    suspicion and it was Dr Seddon's evidence that he had never come across
    anyone with such a profile before.

90.  We accept that the  appellant's  movements  would  give  rise  to  such
    suspicion upon his return to Algeria.  For all we know  they  may  have
    given rise  to  suspicion  in  the  United  Kingdom.   The  pattern  of
    movement, the timing in relation to  the  rise  of  fundamentalism  and
    terrorist  activity  is  marked.   We  accept  that  there   are   both
    similarities and differences between the appellant and the appellant in
    HS.   The main difference  is  that  there  has  not  been  any  public
    statement in the press about this appellant.  But, on the  other  hand,
    he would return on a laissez passer which the authorities in the United
    Kingdom would have had to obtain from the Algerian Embassy.  That would
    draw attention to him on return.  A returnee should not be expected  to
    lie (see, for example, IK  (Turkey)  [2004]  UKIAT  00312)  and  it  is
    unclear what the Algerian authorities know about the appellant. We know
    he visited the Algerian Embassy in Yemen to renew his passport and that
    he registered his marriage at the Embassy in Saudi Arabia.

91.  We cannot know what course would be taken by the authorities  when  the
    appellant returns to Algeria.  Dr Seddon has suggested that, of all the
    Algerian security forces, the DRS is the one most likely to be  brought
    in to investigate the appellant because of his international links  and
    the suspicion that they may be to international terrorism.   Whilst  we
    have no way of knowing  if  that  is  correct  we  accept  there  is  a
    reasonable likelihood that it is.

92.  There was some dispute at the hearing as to the  extent  to  which  the
    Immigration Judge had  accepted  that  the  appellant  was  "known"  or
    wanted" in Algeria.  The appellant had claimed to have been told that a
    case has been opened against him and others who had been in Pakistan as
    long ago as 1991.  The Immigration  Judge  did  not  expressly  make  a
    finding about that but said he placed little weight  on  the  assertion
    that there was a dossier or file on him.  He rejected  the  appellant's
    assertion that he had been told by the Algerian Embassy in Yemen,  when
    he went to renew his passport, that he was wanted.  He did not make  an
    express finding on whether the appellant's wife had  been  interrogated
    when she left Algeria, simply saying that he did not accept  she  would
    have left her son behind if she had been  aware  that  the  authorities
    were interested in the appellant.  He made no finding about Dr Seddon's
    view that the appellant may have been  blacklisted.   In  our  judgment
    that omission is not material in this appeal.  We say that because  the
    main thrust of his case now is  based  on  it  becoming  known  to  the
    Algerian authorities that he has been in the various countries that  he
    has, and his long absence from Algeria.  We find  that   is  sufficient
    for him to succeed for the reasons  which  follow.   If  there  were  a
    dossier on him, or if he was wanted, that could only add to  the  risk.
    In cross-examination Mr Blundell elicited the fact that Dr  Seddon  had
    no evidence to show that the Algerian authorities had been particularly
    concerned about Algerian nationals living and working in Pakistan since
    the emergence of Al Qaeda but we need to  remind  ourselves  that  that
    concern was the 1990s.  As Dr Seddon said, it was then in a  different
    context. Dr Seddon's answer to a number of particular criticisms  made
    by Mr Blundell was that it is the appellant's profile that would  cause
    him difficulties regardless, for example, of whether he had been  known
    to the regime or on a blacklist.  Dr Seddon did accept that he  had  no
    examples of people in circumstances similar  to  the  appellant  having
    encountered adverse attention.  He was able  to  answer  Mr  Blundell's
    observation, that there must be no shortage of people  who  had  worked
    with charities in Pakistan, by saying that  the  appellant  stands  out
    because of the range of places and organisations that he has worked  in
    and for.  He conceded that he had been  unable  to  find  reference  to
    anyone having difficulty  having  returned  from  working  for  Islamic
    charities in any reports from Amnesty, UNHCR,  Human  Rights  Watch  or
    Algerian  NGOs  but  again,  emphasised  the  appellant's   distinctive
    profile.

93.  The main question for us therefore is whether  there  is  a  real  risk
    (not just a possibility) that the  appellant  will  be  seriously  ill-
    treated whilst in the hands of the DRS.  It is his case  that  he  will
    be.  It was not his case that there  was  a  reasonable  likelihood  of
    mistreatment at the hands of any other part of the Algerian Security or
    judicial apparatus.

94.  The question of torture (and inhuman or degrading  treatment  or  other
    serious harm) has been the subject of  considerable  attention  in  the
    context of Algeria.  That is because a number of SIAC  cases,  and  the
    Court of Appeal, have considered  risks  to  returning  Algerians  with
    actual or suspected links to terrorism.  However, caution  is  required
    because the SIAC cases did not simply involve people  who  were  to  be
    returned with such links.  They were people who had what the respondent
    considered to be the  safeguards  of  memoranda  of  understanding  and
    monitoring by the British Embassy.  The question for SIAC was therefore
    whether, notwithstanding those apparent safeguards there  was  still  a
    real risk that the returnees would be seriously  mistreated.   To  that
    extent the SIAC cases were not focused on  the  risk  of  serious  ill-
    treatment in the hands of the DRS in the absence  of  such  safeguards.
    In the event, SIAC considered the safeguards were sufficient to protect
    the returnees.  We accept  that  Q  returned  without  safeguards,  but
    regard his case as  untypical  as  he  returned  at  a  time  when  the
    international spotlight was on the Algerian authorites because  of  the
    other returnees who featured in the SIAC cases and  who  did  have  the
    safeguards.

95.  In HS this Tribunal concluded  that  without  such  safeguards,  for  a
    person who was identified to the Algerian authorities as a  person  who
    may  have  links  to  terrorism,  there  would  be  a  real   risk   of
    mistreatment.  Mr Blundell sought to argue that HS should not be relied
    upon and that is something we deal with later.

96.  In relation to the risks to the appellant if he were to be returned  to
    Algeria and fall into the hands of the DRS, we did not  find  that  the
    evidence in Mr Touaiti's letter took the matter any further.  It is not
    known who he is.  Nor is it known upon what basis he believes that  the
    appellant would be at risk upon return  because  he  had  worked  as  a
    teacher for a relief organisation in Pakistan.

97.  The general thrust of Dr Seddon's evidence was that whilst he  accepted
    that incidents of torture and mistreatment of detainees generally  were
    much improved, he observed  that there had been a number  of  terrorist
    acts occurring in 2007 and 2008 which have caused the  security  forces
    (notably the DRS) to implement a state of counter insurgency which  has
    little regard for the law  and  for  human  rights.   He  said  he  was
    uncertain whether the DRS operated outside the law because they were 'a
    law unto themselves' or whether they had  the  tacit  approval  of  the
    authorities.  He said opinions vary.  We have not found the  wealth  of
    evidence which relates to periods  before  2007  to  be  of  particular
    assistance because of the changing  scene.   Much  of  that  change  is
    reflected by the observations of the Commission in Y v SSHD.  We accept
    that  in  the  past  the  DRS  has  had  a  formidable  reputation  for
    mistreating those who  fall  into  its  hands  in  secret  and  unknown
    locations.  The question is whether those activities still continue and
    whether there is a reasonable likelihood that  the  appellant  will  be
    subjected to serious ill-treatment now on return.  We accept  that,  to
    an extent, what has happened in the past informs  the  present  but  it
    cannot be assumed that things do not  change.   In  2007  Human  Rights
    Watch described to a UN Human Rights  Committee  how  it  regarded  DRS
    operations as "almost untouchable" and said that legal safeguards  were
    all but routinely disregarded according to Amnesty.

98.  In his oral evidence Dr Seddon  accepted  that  conditions  in  prisons
    were improving and that the judiciary and the police no longer  operate
    as independently (i.e. without proper scrutiny) as they once  did.   He
    did not consider that to mean that torture did not continue  to  happen
    to some extent.  Having said that things had been  improving  in  2003,
    2004 and 2005, as the Algerians got on  top  of  the  Islamist  threat,
    there had been the upsurge in the incidents in Algeria from  2007,  and
    the Amnesty report for 2007 referred to persistent reports  of  torture
    and ill-treatment of suspects detained by the authorities  and  accused
    of terrorism related activities.  He  had  to  accept  that  a  similar
    passage did not appear in the 2008 report although he did point to  the
    passage in  which  it  is  said  that  detention  in  secret  locations
    continues.

99.  Dr Seddon had thought that SIAC  had  been  unduly  optimistic  in  its
    assessment of conditions in Algeria and in particular where it observed
    in Y that torture was markedly declining.  But, he had to  agree  that,
    following the return of various SIAC  appellants,  the  Commission  had
    been proved generally right.  He acknowledged that his views  had  been
    described  as  bleak  by  the  Commission  (as  had  Dr  Joffe's),  but
    maintained that he was justified in taking a less  optimistic  view  of
    Algeria than the Commission had, especially following  the  upsurge  of
    bombings in 2007/2008.

100. We were struck by the paucity  of  evidence  about  the  way  in  which
    detainees in the hands of the DRS are treated.  There does  not  appear
    to be any up-to-date material.  The impression given is that there have
    been terrible problems for those detained by the DRS in  the  past  but
    that the general  situation  in  Algeria  (not  confined  to  DRS)  has
    improved markedly.  There has been the criminalisation of  torture  and
    an increased transparency.    The most recent evidence  appears  to  be
    the Amnesty  report  where  references  to  continuing  concerns  about
    torture were not expressly repeated in the 2008  report,  but  they  do
    report that the DRS continues to detain people incommunicado at  secret
    locations.   In other words, the evidence  is  not  that  serious  ill-
    treatment has stopped, it is that the evidence has gone silent  on  the
    issue.  The two more recent Amnesty reports are similar.  We treat them
    with some caution because, as Mr Blundell has pointed out,  it  is  not
    clear what period they cover, much of the evidence cited is  old.   The
    passage on secret detentions, and torture in the context of  the  fight
    against terrorism, in the Amnesty submission speaks of problems in  the
    1990s.  The Amnesty briefing has a section on  torture  facilities  and
    counter-terrorism measures and in particular the powers of the DRS.  It
    does not contain any current evidence as to its current activities.

101. When Mr Blundell came to consider the  SIAC  authorities  he  mentioned
    that in G (handed down 8 February 2007) the Commission  had  said  that
    according to Amnesty in 2006,  in  a  report  that  was  not  disputed,
    torture and ill-treatment continue to be  used  systematically  by  the
    DRS.  Mr Blundell  argued  that  that  was  no  longer  an  appropriate
    observation.  Furthermore, in  G  at  paragraph  26(d)  the  Commission
    accepted that Algerian citizens suspected of terrorism  would,  in  the
    absence of assurances, be at  real  risk  of  torture  and  other  ill-
    treatment.  We take it as showing that, as  late  as  8  February  2007
    there could have been no question of returning this appellant if  there
    were a real risk that he would be interrogated by the DRS.  Mr Blundell
    argued, but we do not accept,  that  the  appellant  would  be  treated
    differently from G because the Commission's judgment  in  G  said  that
    there was reasonable suspicion that G was an  international  terrorist.
    The appellant's case, as we have accepted, is that with his profile  he
    would be so suspected even though (we accept) he would  not  arrive  in
    Algeria with an adverse judgment  of  the  Special  Immigration  Appeal
    Commission on that issue.

102. When referring to U v SSHD Mr Blundell argued  that  the  decision  was
    important because it came  after  a  number  of  individuals  had  been
    returned to Algeria.  Those individuals,  K,  H  and  P  were  not  the
    subject of serious ill-treatment.  However, they cannot be compared  to
    the appellant because they all returned with assurances and  the  offer
    of monitoring from the British Embassy.  Q is different, because he did
    not have such assurances.  Q was returned at the  same  time  as  those
    others  but we do not  think  he  should  be  treated  as  an  ordinary
    returnee.  He may well have benefited from the period of  high  profile
    returns  when  the  spotlight  was  on  Algeria.   The  Commission,  at
    paragraphs 17 and 18, referred to what happened to Q and concluded that
    whilst he was in detention he had been treated  with  respect  and  not
    received any inhuman or degrading treatment.  We treat that finding  of
    the Commission with caution because Q is referred to in the  subsequent
    Amnesty briefing at page 8,  that document being prepared almost a year
    later than the judgment in U.   Q  was  sentenced  to  imprisonment  in
    November 2007 having, according to Amnesty, been tried in  an  Algerian
    Court and convicted of  belonging  to  a  terrorist  network  operating
    abroad.  Amnesty claim that his conviction was based  on  interrogation
    reports prepared by the DRS which he had been forced  to  sign  without
    knowing the content.   He and a co-accused both said they had been ill-
    treated by the DRS.  The co-accused, who made the same  assertions  was
    H, who did have  the  benefit  of  assurances.   The  information  from
    Amnesty is unsourced and we treat the allegations made by Q and H  with
    some circumspection but do note that the  convictions  came  some  time
    after the Commission's judgment.  There may have been evidence provided
    to Amnesty which was not available  to  the  Commission.   Mr Blundell
    considered that paragraph 37 of U was important because  it  said  that
    the Algerians had fulfilled to the letter the assurances given  to  the
    British Government.  We do not understand why Mr Blundell regarded that
    as significant because there  is  an  absence  of  assurances  in  this
    appeal.  The need for assurances  was  confirmed  in  paragraph  37(3),
    where the Commission  found  that  it  was  necessary  to  obtain  such
    assurances  for  an  individual  deportee's  safety  on  return  to  be
    reasonably assured.  Although Mr Blundell referred to paragraph  40  of
    U, in which the Commission had said, "It  cannot  sensibly  be  claimed
    that there is a consistent pattern of a gross and systematic  violation
    of the rights which would be guaranteed by Article 3 if Algeria were  a
    Convention state", that is  not  relevant  to  this  case  because  the
    observation related to prison conditions pending trial.  The  appellant
    does not rely on prison conditions in support of his claim, rather  the
    risk when he is being interrogated following arrival.

103. Y, BB and U was a remitted case from  the  Court  of  Appeal  and  came
    after the Tribunal's decision in HS.  The most important passage in the
    SIAC judgment, to which he referred was, in our judgement,  that  which
    said (in paragraph 22), "Reported ill-treatment, by the DRS, of persons
    in their custody had not increased."   It  then  said,  "There  are  no
    substantial grounds for believing the conditions generally  in  Algeria
    give rise to a real risk that any of the appellants will  be  subjected
    to treatment which would, if it were to occur in  a  Convention  State,
    put that State in breach of its obligations under Article 3  ...".   At
    first blush that appears to assist the respondent's case but it must be
    recalled that the appellants in Y, BB and U  all  had  the  benefit  of
    assurances and an offer of monitoring and that was the context that the
    Commission was considering their cases.  What was said in paragraph  22
    was  that  there  were  no  substantial  grounds  for  believing   that
    conditions generally in Algeria would give rise to a real risk that any
    of those appellants would be subject to such  treatment  when  returned
    with the benefit of assurances.

104. Mr Blundell's submission on PP was that by November 2007 the  situation
    remained unchanged.

105. We then turn to HS which Mr Blundell thought had been decided  without
    reference to Y, BB and U or PP.  His first main criticism is  that  the
    findings in HS went contrary to the general direction of the SIAC cases
    which demonstrated a general improvement.  Having now indicated that we
    do not share Mr  Blundell's  interpretation  of  the  two  most  recent
    Commission determinations, much of what he said  about HS has lost  its
    importance.  It is true to say that the Tribunal relied to some  extent
    on the UNHCR position paper at 2004 and that Dr Seddon had acknowledged
    a lot of water had gone under the bridge since then.  Before us he also
    said that the water both  ebbed  and  flowed.   Since  about  2007  the
    general situation in Algeria  has  deteriorated  as  a  result  of  the
    increase in terrorist activity.  There is no evidence  that  there  has
    been a continuing level of  general  improvement  for  those  who  find
    themselves in the hands of the DRS.

106. Mr Blundell's other criticism of the determination in  HS  is  that  it
    referred, in paragraph 121, to 'guaranteeing disinterest; and  ensuring
    disinterest'. Also that in paragraph 122 the Tribunal  said  there  was
    "no  guarantee  the  appellant  will  be  protected   from   any   such
    malpractice".   Mr Blundell argued that refugee law does  not  deal  in
    guarantees and the proper question was whether there would  be  a  real
    risk.  The respondent did not appeal the decision in HS  in  which  the
    appellant succeeded.  We interpret those observations in  HS  as  being
    the obverse of the 'real risk  coin'.  Of course something less than  a
    guarantee  would  be  a  risk,  less  than  a  real  risk.   When   the
    determination is read as a whole it is  clear  that  the  Tribunal  was
    considering real risk, or reasonable likelihood.

107. In summary, our judgement is this.   The appellant is a person  who  is
    reasonably likely to be suspected of links  to  terrorism  when  he  is
    returned, with a laissez passer, to Algeria, following  a  twenty  year
    absence.  The suspicion will arise simply from the places he  has  been
    in, and the organisations for which he has worked and he  will  not  be
    able to disguise that and hide it from the  authorities.   Consequently
    it is reasonably likely he will be referred to the DRS.

108. Historically, there is no doubt whatsoever that  the  DRS  have  had  a
    justified reputation  for  seriously  mistreating,  to  the  extent  of
    torturing and inflicting inhuman and degrading treatment, detainees  in
    secret detention centres.  We are not satisfied that any  of  the  SIAC
    appellants who have been returned with assurances, and who have largely
    been reasonably treated, are any sort of indicator about the way that a
    returnee without assurances  and  the  benefit  of  monitoring  by  the
    British Embassy would be treated.  At no time did  the  Commission  say
    that  it  will  be  safe  to  return  any  of  the  appellants  without
    assurances; it merely said that with  assurances  they  were  satisfied
    there was not a real risk they would be so mistreated.   Every  one  of
    the  appeals  has  been  decided  in  that  context.   In  the  earlier
    Commission cases it was expressly said that without assurances it would
    not be safe to return the appellant. The later cases have  simply  said
    that returning them with assurances continued to be safe.   We  do  not
    accept that the Amnesty  briefing  about  the  treatment  of  Q  and  H
    undermines that reasoning.  The report is  unsourced  and  we  have  no
    evidence as to the form of ill-treatment said to have been  handed  out
    to them.

109. Although the 2008 Amnesty Report did not  expressly  refer  to  torture
    continuing at the same rate as it had previously said, it did refer  to
    continuing incommunicado and secret detention.  We do not to  take  the
    absence of an express reference to torture (as opposed  to  a  positive
    reference to a cessation or reduction), to mean that it is now safe  to
    return the appellant when it would not have been  previously.   At  its
    highest the evidence about torture  has  gone  quiet  but  we  are  not
    persuaded  that  the  DRS  has  materially  changed.   We  accept  that
    conditions throughout the rest of the legal and  security  systems  may
    well have improved due to increased transparency  and  monitoring,  but
    there is still no evidence  that  the  DRS  has  opened  its  doors  to
    external  monitoring,  nor  that  it  has  become  accountable  in  any
    meaningful way.

110. If the language used in HS gave the impression that HS won  his  appeal
    because there was no guarantee of his safety then we do not  adopt  it.
    On the evidence which we have seen (and which was seen in HS), allowing
    for the passage of time and two subsequent SIAC cases, we are satisfied
    that there is a real risk that this  appellant  will  be  subjected  to
    inhuman or degrading treatment and/or torture at the hands of  the  DRS
    when he is returned to Algeria for the reasons we have given.

Summary

    i).  An appellant who can establish that he has a history that suggests
        he may have connections to international terrorism is at real  risk
        of being detained on arrival in Algeria, and investigated

    ii).  It  is  reasonably  likely  that  when  the   suspicion   is   of
        international terrorism such a returnee will  be  passed  into  the
        hands of the DRS for further interrogation.

    iii) The historic evidence about the DRS's propensity to use torture as
        a means of interrogation, together with the continuing  absence  of
        any evidence of  accountability  or  monitoring  strongly  suggests
        that, in the absence of evidence to the  contrary,  the  DRS  still
        uses torture and other  serious  ill-treatment  in  its  places  of
        secret incommunicado detention.

    Decision

    i)   The appeal is allowed on asylum grounds.

     ii) The appeal is allowed on Article 3 ECHR grounds.
