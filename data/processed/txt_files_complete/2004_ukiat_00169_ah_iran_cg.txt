Appearances:

For the appellant:           Miss W Lau, of Counsel, instructed by
                       Global Immigration Services
For the respondent:    Mr B O'Leary, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    The Appellant, a citizen of Iran, appeals with permission against the
      Determination  of  an  Adjudicator,  Mrs  D  E  Taylor,  sitting   in
      Manchester, in which she dismissed on asylum and human rights grounds
      the Appellant's Appeal against the decision of the Respondent  on  24
      June 2002 to give directions for the  Appellant's  removal  from  the
      United Kingdom.

2.    The Appellant claimed to be a member of a persecuted tribe  in  Iran,
      the Gashgai, and that the authorities in Iran wanted him  because  he
      had been involved in June 2000  in  a  confrontation  concerning  the
      confiscation of the family farm.  After firing started, the Appellant
      became very frightened and  ran  towards  the  mountains,  whence  he
      escaped to the United Kingdom.

3.    The Appellant told the Adjudicator  that  there  was  an  outstanding
      arrest warrant against him, issued in January 2002.  This  is  to  be
      found  (with  translation)  at  pages  42A-B   of   the   Appellant's
      Adjudicator bundle.

4.    The Adjudicator  decided  to  place  no  weight  upon  this  document
      because, although the Appellant said  that  there  were  two  earlier
      arrest warrants, these had not been produced before the  Adjudicator.
      Given the effluxion of time between the alleged incident in 2000  and
      the "warrant" which was dated January 2003, the Adjudicator  did  not
      consider that the "warrant" could be regarded as reliable (paragraphs
      17, 18 and 22 of the determination).

5.    The Adjudicator, at paragraphs 19 and 20, noted the fact  that  there
      was nothing in the objective  evidence  on  Iran  to  show  that  the
      Gashgai were persecuted  by  the  authorities.   Furthermore,  it  is
      apparent from those paragraphs that the Adjudicator considered it  as
      frankly strange that what little was said about the  Gashgai  was  to
      the effect that they were nomadic, whereas the Appellant had attended
      University and supposedly was in fear of the Authorities because they
      had tried to seize the family farm.

6.    At paragraph 22, the Adjudicator noted that there were  no  documents
      submitted relating to the confiscation of the land  which,  according
      to paragraph 21, was not after all confiscated by anyone in June 2000
      but had only been taken over "about a  year  ago".   The  Appellant's
      large family remained in Iran except for Ibrahim  who  had  left  the
      country three or four months ago.  The Adjudicator noted  that  there
      did not appear to be a link between Ibrahim's departure and the  loss
      of the family's land.

7.    The Adjudicator was not impressed by a letter from Homa Gashghai  who
      had written "to the Honourable Government of the United  Kingdom"  to
      certify that the Appellant "is one of the Gashgai's fighters" who was
      "arrested and tortured by the Islamic government of  Iran"  and  that
      "his family members are one of the most fighters  (sic)  families  in
      the tribe, who were fighting to regain  their  tribal  and  religious
      rights back".  Reference is made to battles during 1980 to 1982  when
      the tribe, was supposedly "tormented, arrested and prosecuted by  the
      Iranian government".

8.    Permission to appeal to  the  Tribunal  was  granted  on  two  bases.
      First, it was  asserted  that  the  earlier  arrest  warrants,  whose
      absence the Adjudicator noted, had now been obtained by the Appellant
      "through a fax machine".  Secondly, the Vice  President  who  granted
      permission was concerned that the Adjudicator had arguably  said  too
      little about the human rights aspects of the appeal.

9.    In order for the subsequent production of evidence to be relied  upon
      so as to overturn a determination which discloses no error of law, it
      must be shown that there is a reasonable explanation for the  failure
      of the Appellant to place that evidence before the  Adjudicator.   No
      such explanation has been given in the  present  case.   Ms  Lal,  on
      instructions, said that her client had told her that the  friend  who
      had sent the later "arrest warrant" from Iran to him  did  not  think
      that the earlier warning letters (as they are now described) would be
      important and that  it  was  only  necessary  to  submit  the  latest
      document.  Given, however, that the Appellant was by definition aware
      of the earlier documents, he plainly could and should have done  what
      he subsequently is supposed to have undertaken,  namely,  to  procure
      from Iran the earlier letters, so that all relevant evidence could be
      before the Adjudicator.

10.   In any event, the warning letters could not, in the  Tribunal's  view
      have  had  any  material  effect  upon  any  reasonable  Adjudicator,
      considering the evidence overall in  the  present  case.   These  two
      warning letters appear in substance to be of the  same  kind  as  the
      document  described  as  "an  arrest  warrant",  contained   in   the
      Adjudicator bundle.  The translation of  that  document  contains  no
      reference to anyone being authorised to arrest  the  Appellant.   The
      two new warning letters are respectively dated 9 February 2001 and  9
      August 2001.  They describe the Appellant as a "retired teacher" (the
      Appellant  being  born  in  1973).   They  supposedly   require   his
      attendance at Court on, respectively, 9 February and 9  August  2001.
      If  the  Authorities  were  genuinely  interested  in  pursuing   the
      Appellant, it frankly beggars belief that they would issue a sporadic
      series of "warning letters", only beginning some 7 months  after  the
      alleged incident in June 2000 and containing  no  follow  up  at  all
      during the year 2002.

11.   Ms Lal acknowledged that the absence of objective  evidence  to  show
      that the Gashgai are persecuted or even discriminated against by  the
      Iranian State was a difficulty  for  the  Appellant.   All  that  she
      herself had been able to find was a short  piece  from  "Iran  Today"
      which she had faxed to the  Tribunal.   This  describes  the  "Spring
      Migration of the Gashgai", which involved over 100 groups of  Gashgai
      migrating with their animals, following the coming of springtime.  Ms
      Lal submitted that evidence to support the Appellant's  assertion  of
      persecution on the grounds of ethnicity could be said to be supported
      by  the  comment  in  the  article  that  the  Gashgai  regarded  the
      correspondent's guide as not  to  be  trusted  "since  he  spoke  the
      language of the Gashgai (a variation  of  Turkish),  Farsee  and  the
      language of  the  foreigners  -  English!"   The  Tribunal  does  not
      consider that this passage can bear any such interpretation.

11.    Indeed,  in  a  country  as  closely  scrutinised  by  human  rights
      organisations and foreign observers as Iran, the absence of  anything
      to show that the Gashgai are suffering at the hands  of  the  Iranian
      authorities is, we consider, an indicator of the strongest kind  that
      the Gashgai are not suffering any such difficulties. The letter  from
      "Homa Gashgai", with its assertion that the Gashgai are  tortured  by
      the authorities and are fighting to regain lands and religious rights
      (see paragraph 7 above), is unsupported by any source and is  plainly
      an inept concoction.

12.   The Appellant's  account,  as  well  as  being  inherently  weak  and
      implausible, for the reasons identified by the  Adjudicator,  suffers
      accordingly  from  the  additional  problem  that  it   is   entirely
      unsupported by any objective evidence.

13.   The Adjudicator should, we consider, have  made  it  plain  that  her
      findings on the credibility of the  Appellant's  account  meant  that
      there was no real risk  to  him,  upon  return  to  Iran,  either  of
      persecution for a refugee Convention reason or of treatment  contrary
      to Article 3 of the ECHR.  Having said this, it is manifest that  the
      Adjudicator's findings of fact point inexorably to such a conclusion.



14.   This Appeal is dismissed.
