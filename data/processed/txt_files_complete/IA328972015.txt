                            DECISION AND REASONS


Introduction

1.   The appellant  is  Turkish  by  background  but  he  is  an  Australian
    national. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal against the
    refusal of leave to  remain  indefinitely,  based  on  his  five  years
    employment on a work permit. That decision was on 25 September 2015.

2.   The appellant's appeal was heard by Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Andonian (the Immigration Judge) on 14 November 2016.  The  Immigration
    Judge was satisfied that the appellant  met  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  In particular, the Immigration Judge was  satisfied
    that the appellant's net income, and indeed his gross income, was above
    the level that was required to satisfy paragraphs 134  to  135  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  Paragraph 134 of the  Immigration  Rules  allows  a
    person to be given leave to remain on an application where he has spent
    a continuous period of five years lawfully in the UK and for the  whole
    of that period he has been a work permit holder  or  a  highly  skilled
    migrant or  falls  within  certain  other  categories  of  person.   My
    attention was specifically drawn to sub-paragraph  (iv)  of  that  Rule
    which requires the applicant to provide certification from an  employer
    in  an  applicable  case,  that  the  appellant  has  paid  above   the
    appropriate rate for the job as is stated in the Codes of  Practice  in
    Appendix J.  In this case the Immigration Judge was satisfied that  the
    appellant was indeed paid at the appropriate rate to qualify under that
    provision.

3.   The respondent appealed the  original  decision,  principally,  because
    there was an arguable procedural unfairness in the way the  Immigration
    Judge had approached the case.  In particular, the respondent had  been
    faced with an 800-page bundle on  the  morning  of  the  hearing  with,
    depending on which version of  the  facts  you  read,  either  only  30
    minutes  or  only  45  minutes  to  prepare.   However,  there  was  an
    additional arguable error that was  raised  by  the  Immigration  Judge
    granted permission to appeal (Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Caroline
    Andrew) which related to the extent to which  the  appellant's  income,
    mortgage  and  car  finance  repayments  were  a  relevant  factor   in
    determining the outcome of the criteria being satisfied.

The hearing

4.   At the hearing before the Upper Tribunal,  Mr  Bramble  carried  out  a
    review of the file and as a result of that was able to go  through  the
    key documents in the case.  He identified that  there  was  a  document
    dated 11 August 2014 from the appellant's employer (Albe  Tekstil  -  a
    Turkish registered company) which  indicated  that  as  a  package  the
    appellant's salary, which was paid to the appellant was  on  a  monthly
    basis, amounted to �2,200.  The mortgage was paid by the company in the
    sum of �8,900 per annum and a  car  payment  made  of  �4,000,  but  in
    addition the appellant received a  weekly  sum  of  �125.   Mr  Bramble
    explained that although these figures were not very well  explained  or
    set out by the appellant's employer, when he  actually  carried  out  a
    proper analysis of the figures, this translated  to  an  actual  annual
    salary on his calculations of �45,800, as  had  been  set  out  in  the
    letter of 11 August 2014.  He was also  of  the  view  that  there  was
    nothing by way  of  the  definition  of  "certification"  in  paragraph
    134(iv) of the Immigration Rules which indicated that  a  letter  would
    not suffice as certification, and on that basis,  he  was  prepared  to
    accept that, although there was a procedural unfairness in the way  the
    Immigration Judge had approached  the  hearing  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, that procedural fairness was not causative  of  any  material
    error of law. As a result of Mr Bramble's realistic acceptance that any
    procedural unfairness did not affect the outcome, the ultimate decision
    was the correct decision for the Immigration Judge to have reached.

5.   I briefly called on Miss Daykin to respond.  She was content to  accept
    the representations made by Mr Bramble and to adopt his concession that
    the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  correct.  Ultimately,
    whatever procedural irregularities there may have  been,  the  decision
    was correct.

Conclusion

6.   I should say that I do not in any way intend to  endorse  the  practice
    of serving large bundles of documents on the day  of  contested  First-
    tier Tribunal hearings. Judges of the  First-tier  Tribunal  are  under
    significant pressure as to time and I am well aware how frustrating  it
    is for the parties and their representatives to  be  faced  with  large
    quantities of material  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  without  any
    proper opportunity parties or the judge to assimilate that material. In
    addition, it places the tribunal under significant pressure to conclude
    the hearing within the day allowed. However, I accept that in this case
    the information supplied before the First-tier Tribunal was  sufficient
    to discharge the civil standard of proving that the appellant satisfied
    the criteria of paragraph 134 of the Immigration Rules.

7.   I accept Mr Bramble's section on behalf of the  respondent  that  there
    was no material  error  of  law  in  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

Notice of Decision

8.   The decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge to allow the  appellant's
    appeal stands. The appeal to the Upper Tribunal by  the  respondent  is
    hereby dismissed.

5.   No anonymity direction is made.
