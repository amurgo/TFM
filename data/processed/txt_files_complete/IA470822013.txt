Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr D Eteko, Legal Representative of Iras & Co
For the Respondent:    Mr G Jack, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellant, a national of  C�te  d'Ivoire  (Ivory  Coast),  date  of
    birth 3 June 1979, appealed against the Respondent's decision dated  23
    October 2013 to refuse to vary leave to remain and to  make  a  removal
    decision under Section 47 of the Immigration,  Asylum  and  Nationality
    Act 2006.

2.   The appeal against that decision came before First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    L K Gibbs, who  on  10  April  2014  dismissed  the  appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules.  The judge also dismissed  an  application  for  the
    appeal to be considered under Article 8 of  the  ECHR  outside  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

3.   The basis of the challenge to the judge's decision was that  the  judge
    had not properly  identified  whether  or  not  the  case  fell  to  be
    considered outside of the Rules.  Permission to  appeal  that  decision
    was given by Upper Tribunal Judge Peter Lane on 2 July 2014 in which he
    stated:

         "1.  It is arguable that, on the  facts,  the  First-tier  Tribunal
             Judge erred in law in truncating her Article 8  assessment  in
             the way set out at [13] to [15] of the determination.  At this
             stage it cannot be  said  that  a  full-blown  proportionality
             assessment (if required) would have been bound to  favour  the
             Respondent; but the Appellant must be prepared to meet such an
             argument at the forthcoming hearing.  ..."

4.   Permission was therefore  granted  on  the  Appellant's  grounds.   The
    grounds assert as follows:

         "5.  It is submitted the FTJ erred in law as  she  failed  to  give
             adequate reasons as to why despite the Appellant's painstaking
             immigration history (9.5 years of lawful  immigration  in  the
             UK), a steady employment, a law-abiding person, seven years of
             contribution as a taxpayer, the overall  concerning  situation
             in the Appellant's country and the  very  fact  that  she  has
             never returned to her country since she arrived  in  2004  and
             that all her family have fled her country since the war  broke
             out in 2005, and despite showing sympathy  to  her  situation,
             her case could not have been assessed outside the Rules or was
             unlikely to merit a grant of leave outside the Rules (sic)."

5.   Paragraph 6 of the grounds made the following points:

         "The findings that the Appellant's child was a baby  and  would  be
         returning with her and that they will both return  to  her  country
         where she has spent the majority of her life was  not  an  adequate
         reason to justify that consideration of Article 8 on a freestanding
         basis was irrelevant (emphasis put on  Haleemudeen  v  SSHD  [2014]
         EWCA Civ 558)."

6.   The judge considered the Appellant's claim and it is not said that  the
    documents or the facts or matters recorded in the determination between
    paragraphs 6 and 9 contain  any  material  factual  omissions.   It  is
    accepted, for no  issue  was  taken,  that  the  judge  summarised  the
    submissions that had been made on behalf of the  Respondent  and  those
    made by Mr Eteko, who appeared there.   It  was  unsurprising  that  Mr
    Eteko correctly accepted then, as he did before me, that the  Appellant
    could not meet the requirements of paragraph 276ADE of the  Immigration
    Rules nor under Appendix FM.

7.   The judge therefore moved to the question of  whether  or  not  in  the
    light of the way it was expressed in Gulshan [2013] UKUT 640  (IAC)  it
    was appropriate to look at this matter outside of the  Rules.   As  has
    been identified through the cases of MF (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ  1192
    and Nagre [2013] EWHC Civ 720 there need to be clear circumstances that
    are not covered by the Rules and there needed to be  an  arguably  good
    case that such a claim could succeed. As it is  expressed  in  Gulshan,
    not only are there compelling circumstances not sufficiently recognised
    under the Rules but  also   the  consequences  for  an  individual  are
    unjustifiably harsh so that the decision is disproportionate.

8.   In the circumstances I find the position as  expressed  by  Mr  Justice
    Sales in Nagre of help insofar as the residual discretion  to  consider
    the requirements of Article 8 of the ECHR may arise and cannot be fully
    excluded. There needs to be sufficient evidence to be able to  properly
    assess proportionality if Article 8 is to be considered.

9.   In this case it is plain that whilst there are  considerations  of  the
    length of time the Appellant has been in the United Kingdom,  the  fact
    that she has acted in accordance with the law and has not  been  guilty
    of crime or other matters and indeed generally has played some part  in
    the society of those who live around here these are facts but they  are
    not anything other than that which might reasonably be  expected  of  a
    national in any event and as such they are not exceptional matters.

10.  Similarly the issue of the Appellant's 17,  18  month  year  old  child
    present in the UK with her is a  consideration  that  falls  under  the
    Rules in  terms  of  its  impact  on  the  Appellant  but  also  is  of
    materiality in the assessment under Section 55 BCIA 2009 of the  impact
    of removal upon the child bearing also  in  mind  the  decision  in  ZH
    (Tanzania) [reference to be added].

11.  There was unfortunately, bearing in mind the limited  evidence,  little
    of an exceptional case or of circumstances that demonstrated  that  the
    general issue of the removal of the child militated in  favour  of  the
    Appellant remaining.  In this case the child  is  very  young,  is  not
    going to school and has no particular ties of any  variety  other  than
    the connection with an uncle in the UK  and  plainly  as  a  matter  of
    approach the child's interests lie in being with their  mother.   Mr  D
    Eteko equated as a comparator the differences between what  life  might
    be like in  C�te  d'Ivoire  in  terms  of  education,  health,  working
    circumstances and care provided and simply said it was unarguable  that
    those matters would be different and would  be  better  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  Those may be matters that are  pertinent  to  proportionality
    but I do not find that they indicate the kind  of  circumstances  which
    are not covered by the Rules and by  the  broad  consideration  of  the
    Rules and inevitably the issue of the public interest.

12.  The judge found on the evidence,  such  as  it  was  before  her,  that
    however sympathetic she might be to them, that is the child, and to the
    Appellant, they did not amount to matters sufficient to  consider  this
    case under Article 8 outside of the Rules.  It has to be said that even
    on the evidence that was provided and confirmed to me by Mr  Eteko  the
    evidence was very bare and brief concerning anything  to  do  with  the
    child and the child's personal circumstances let alone  any  health  or
    other issues.  The Appellant's statement simply says virtually  nothing
    about the Appellant's private life in the UK and nothing about care  or
    other needs which are related to the child, H M E N E, date of birth 11
    October 2012.

13.  I conclude that the judge made no arguable material  error  of  law  in
    the consideration of the  matter.   The  original  Tribunal's  decision
    stands.
14.  Anonymity Order.
        The judge did not make  an  anonymity  order  but  in  view  of  the
    Presidential Statement in the First-tier Tribunal and the circumstances
    of this case involving a young child it seems to me that  an  anonymity
    order is to be made.
DIRECTION REGARDING ANONYMITY - RULE 45(4)(I) OF THE ASYLUM AND  IMMIGRATION
TRIBUNAL (PROCEDURE) RULES 2005
Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify her  or  any  member  of  her  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Respondent and to  the  Appellant.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

TO THE RESPONDENT FEE AWARD

In the circumstances of the appeal failing it is not appropriate to  make  a
fee award in this case.
