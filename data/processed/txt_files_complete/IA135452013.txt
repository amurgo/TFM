For the Respondent:    Mr T Wilding, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal by the Appellant, a  citizen  of  India  born  on  30
    August 1986, against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  C  H
    Bennett who, sitting  at  Taylor  House  on  7  March  2014  and  in  a
    determination subsequently promulgated on 19 March 2014, dismissed  the
    appeal of the Appellant against the decision of the Respondent dated 22
    April 2013, refusing the Appellant's combined application for leave  to
    remain in the UK as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant under  the  Points-
    Based System and for a Biometric Residence Permit.

2.   The brief immigration history of the Appellant is that on  22  February
    2009 he was granted leave to enter the UK as a student until 31 October
    2010.  On 21 October 2010 he was granted leave to remain as  a  Tier  1
    (Post-Study Work) Migrant until 21 October 2012.

3.   On 19 October 2012 he made the current application.

4.   It would be as well at this stage, to  set  out  below  the  First-tier
    Judge's summary as to the nature  of  the  application  insofar  as  is
    relevant to the present appeal that also sets out the basis upon  which
    the Respondent refused the Appellant's application, as follows:

         "2.  On 19 October 2012, Mr M applied for leave to remain as a Tier
             1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant under the Points-Based System.   What
             he  stated  in  his  application  form  and  the  accompanying
             documents was (in summary and  so  far  as  relevant)  to  the
             following effect.


             (a)  He was a managing director and sole shareholder in  Nexus
                  Marketing Solutions Limited ('the Company').


             (b)  He had a total of �50,000 available, held in a 'regulated
                  financial  institution'  and  'disposable  in  the  United
                  Kingdom'.  The funds were  held,  as  to  �30,000,  in  an
                  account with the Santander Bank and, as to the balance  of
                  �20,000, in an account with Lloyds TSB Bank.


             (c)  The Company had a contract with Tasri Limited  signed  by
                  both Mr M (on behalf of the Company) and by Tasri  Limited
                  on 1 October 2012.  Under that contract, Tasri Limited was
                  to  supply  'E-lites  Electronic  Cigarettes'  and   other
                  merchandise, as well as marketing material to be  used  in
                  connection with the sale of the electronic  cigarettes  to
                  the company.


             (d)  The 'SOC Code'  relating  to  his  position  as  managing
                  director of the Company (see page 34  of  the  application
                  form) was 1163, 'Retail and Wholesale Manager'.


         3.   To demonstrate the holding of the funds,  Mr  M  included  two
             statements, the one from Santander and the other from  Lloyds.
             The first, the Santander statement, shows that the funds  were
             held in an account in the name of  Harhar  Patel  (Mr  Patel).
             The closing balance, on 5 October 2012, was  �40,690.24.   The
             account with Lloyds was in Mr M's own name and was held at its
             East Ham High Street  branch.   After  credit  entries  on  10
             October 2012 of �2,500, 12 October 2012 of �1,500, 15  October
             2012 of �2,500 and on 17 October 2012 of �9,500,  the  closing
             balance on that day 17 October 2012 was �21,047.77.


         4.   On 22 April  2013  the  Secretary  of  State  refused  Mr  M's
             application.  She was not satisfied that the  requirements  of
             paragraph 245DD of  the  Immigration  Rules,  were  fulfilled.
             Specifically, she was not satisfied that Mr  M  qualified  for
             any points under Appendix A.  The matters which concerned  her
             were as follows:


             (a)  Mr M had not provided a current appointment  report  from
                  Companies  House  demonstrating  that,  within  the  three
                  months immediately prior to 19 October 2012,


                  (i)  the Company had been registered (as a new or existing
                      business), and


                  (ii) he (Mr M) was registered as a director,


             (b)  the evidence which Mr M had submitted, i.e. the  contract
                  between the Company and Tasri Limited indicated  that  the
                  company's  business  was  buying  and  selling  electronic
                  cigarettes - so that it was undertaking a retail  business
                  and therefore


                  (1)  his position as managing director was


                      (i)  not an occupation within the Codes  of  Practice
                           in  Appendix  J  appropriate  for  those  holding
                           National Qualifications  Framework  Qualification
                           at level 4 or above, but


                      (ii) an  occupation  within  the  Codes  of  Practice
                           appropriate   for   those   having   a   National
                           Qualifications Framework Qualification  at  level
                           3, and


                  (2)  the advertisement for the Company's business did  not
                      show Mr M's name (albeit that it showed the  name  of
                      the Company) and


             (c)  although Mr M had provided the two bank  statements,  the
                  one from Santander and the other from Lloyds,


                  (1)  the statement from Santander did not confirm that the
                      �30,000 held in that account was available to  Mr  M,
                      and


                  (2)  Mr  M  had  not  provided  a  letter  from  Santander
                      confirming the details required by paragraph 41-SD of
                      Appendix  A  (I   refer   below   to   the   specific
                      requirements of paragraph 41-SD).


         6.   On 8 May 2013 Mr M gave notice of appeal.  What he  stated  in
             the grounds of appeal was (in summary) that the  Secretary  of
             State's decision (singular) was


             (a)  not in accordance  with  the  Immigration  Rules  or  the
                  'guidance at the time of application', and


             (b)  unfair and unreasonable."


5.   At paragraph 10 of his determination,  the  First-tier  Judge  recorded
    that paragraph 245DD of the Immigration Rules set out the  requirements
    that an individual seeking leave to remain as a Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)
    Migrant had to satisfy if he was to be granted leave  to  remain.   The
    Judge continued:

         "The relevant requirement, in Mr M's case, is as set  out  in  sub-
         paragraph (b) namely that


             'the  applicant  must  have  a  minimum  of  75  points  under
             paragraphs 35 to 53 of Appendix A'".

6.   The Judge set out the  relevant  requirements  of  the  Rules  and  its
    appendices as at 22 April 2013 (the date of the Respondent's  decision)
    over paragraph 11 of his determination mindful of  the  fact  that  the
    Appellant's application was refused under paragraph 245DD and  Appendix
    A on the basis that from the documents provided, the Respondent was not
    satisfied that the Appellant was entitled to the award of 25 points for
    access to �50,000 of funds, for the reasons that the  Judge  summarised
    in paragraph 4 of his determination.

7.   At paragraphs 12 and 13 of the determination the Judge had  inter  alia
    this to say

         "12. It is for Mr M to satisfy me, on the balance of probabilities,
             of the factual basis for the proposition that he qualified for
             the 75 points under Appendix  A.   It  is  apparent  from  the
             provisions of Appendix A which I have set out above, that  his
             having access to the relevant funds (including the amount  and
             that he has permission to use  the  funds  to  invest  in  the
             company's business) may be proved only by  the  production  of
             the 'specified documents', i.e. those documents  specified  in
             paragraph  41-SD;  see  paragraph  41(a)   and   (b).    Those
             provisions do not permit proof by either the  giving  of  oral
             evidence or in any other manner than  the  production  of  the
             specified documents."


8.   At the outset of paragraph 13 of  his  determination,  the  Judge  made
    reference to the observations of Viscount  Sumner  in  Equitable  Trust
    Company of New York v Dawson Partners [1927] 27 Lloyd's L.R. 49  at  52
    that he considered to be apposite namely:

         "There is no room for documents which are almost the same or  which
         will do just as well".

9.   The Judge continued at paragraph 13 as follows:

         "Where the Rules specify the documents which must  be  produced  to
         demonstrate a particular fact, documents of the kind specified must
         be produced.  No other documents, even though they may  be  'almost
         the same', will do.  Nor is any other method of proof permitted".

10.  Over paragraphs 19 to 21 of his  determination,  the  First-tier  Judge
    reasoned the basis upon which he concluded that the Appellant  had  not
    established that he had access to �50,000 "in the manner  provided  for
    in Table 4  and  paragraphs  41  and  41-SD"  and  that  therefore  the
    Appellant did not qualify for the 75 points under paragraphs 35  to  53
    of Appendix A or for leave to remain under paragraph 245DD.

11.  At paragraph 22 of his determination, the Judge  pointed  out  that  he
    was mindful that on 22 April 2013 paragraph 245AA  of  the  Immigration
    Rules subheaded "Documents not submitted with  applications"  provided,
    so far as is material to the present appeal that:

         "(a) Where Part 6A or any appendices referred to in Part  6A  state
             that specified documents  must  be  provided,  the  UK  Border
             Agency will only consider documents that have  been  submitted
             with  the  application  and  will  only   consider   documents
             submitted after the application where they  are  submitted  in
             accordance with subparagraph (b).


         (b)  If the applicant has submitted:


             (i)  a sequence of documents and some of the documents in  the
                  sequence have been  omitted  (for  example,  if  one  bank
                  statement from a series is missing);


             (ii) a document in the wrong format;

             or


             (iii)    a document  that  is  a  copy  and  not  an  original
                  document,

             the  UK  Border  Agency  may  contact  the  applicant  or  his
             representative in writing, and request the correct  documents.
             The requested documents must be  received  by  the  UK  Border
             Agency at the  address  specified  in  the  request  within  7
             working days of the date of the request.


         (c)  The UK Border  Agency  will  not  request  documents  where  a
             specified document has not  been  submitted  (for  example  an
             English language certificate  is  missing)  or  where  the  UK
             Border Agency does not anticipate that addressing the omission
             or error referred to in subparagraph (b) will lead to a  grant
             because the application will be refused for other reasons.


         (d)  If the applicant has submitted a specified document:


             (i)  in the wrong format, or


             (ii) that is a copy and not an original document,


             the application may be granted exceptionally, providing the UK
             Border Agency is satisfied that the  specified  documents  are
             genuine and the applicant meets all  the  other  requirements.
             The UK  Border  Agency  reserves  the  right  to  request  the
             specified original documents in  the  correct  format  in  all
             cases where (b) applies and to refuse  applications  if  these
             documents are not provided as set out in (b)".


12.   The  First-tier  Judge  recorded  the   Appellant's   representative's
    submission that by virtue of subparagraph (b)(i) the  Respondent  ought
    to have made contact with the Appellant before deciding the application
    so as to give him  the  opportunity  to  correct  the  deficiency.   In
    response to that submission the Judge at paragraph 24 had this to say:

         "As to (b)(i) the Santander  statement  cannot,  realistically,  be
         categorised as  a  document  which  did  not  contain  all  of  the
         specified information.  It was a document of a different  class  or
         category.  As indicated above, paragraph 41-SD(a) provides for  the
         two categories of documents,  i.e.  those  identified  in  sub-sub-
         paragraph (i) and (ii) respectively.  Mr M's failure  to  submit  a
         letter falling  within  sub-paragraph  (a)(i)  cannot  properly  be
         categorised as the failure to provide 'some of the documents  in  a
         sequence' within paragraph 245AA(b)(i).  It was a simple failure to
         provide a 'specified document' of a particular class  or  category.
         There was no 'sequence'.  By virtue of paragraph 245AA(c) there was
         no duty to make contact with Mr M in relation to that omission."

13.  At paragraph 26 of his determination and in response to the  submission
    that the Rules themselves were unfair or involved procedural  fairness,
    the Judge had inter alia, this to say:

         "(The) contention that the  Rules  themselves  were  unfair  and/or
         involved procedural unfairness, either because they did not  permit
         the giving of oral evidence, particularly in a case  such  as  this
         where Santander had declined itself to vouch that the  monies  were
         available for Mr M's use, there is a very simple answer.  I have no
         jurisdiction to determine whether the provisions of the Immigration
         Rules are or are not fair.  If any challenge to their  fairness  is
         to be taken, the appropriate  means  of  doing  so  is  by  way  of
         judicial review.  But over and above that I  do  not  accept  (the)
         submission.  ...  The correct course, where an individual relies on
         funding from a third party, is to provide a letter within paragraph
         41-SD(a)(i) and the documents required by  sub-paragraph  (b)  i.e.
         the declaration from the third party and  a  letter  from  a  legal
         representative vouching the validity of the signature."

14.  In conclusion, the Judge for the reasons stated, expressed  himself  to
    be not satisfied that the Appellant  qualified  for  any  points  under
    Appendix A and agreed with the  Respondent's  decision  to  refuse  the
    application.

15.  The Judge at paragraph 30 of his  determination  continued  inter  alia
    that:

         "The decision to refuse (the Appellant's) application for leave  to
         remain was therefore correct and in accordance with the law and the
         Immigration Rules".

16.   In  granting  permission  to  appeal,  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Freeman
    considered it arguable that the letter provided in this case  did  come
    within the terms  of  paragraph  245AA  (a)  of  the  Rules  where  the
    necessary discretion arose under 245AA (b) (see above).

17.  Prior to the hearing of the appeal and by letter dated 3 July 2014  the
    Respondent served her Rule 24 response in  which  at  paragraph  3  the
    following was stated:

         "The grounds argue that the decision is not in accordance with  the
         law for failing to apply evidential flexibility.  It is clear  that
         evidential flexibility would not have applied, as this was  a  case
         where more than one concern  had  been  raised.   For  example,  no
         current appointment report from Companies House,  his  position  as
         managing director was considered to be  an  occupation  within  the
         Codes of  Practice  for  those  having  a  National  Qualifications
         Framework Qualification at Level 3, rather than level 4  or  above,
         and the bank  statements  did  not  confirm  that  the  funds  were
         available to the Appellant".

18.  In that regard the Respondent was no doubt referring to the  provisions
    of paragraph 245AA(c) (see above).

19.  This was indeed a matter that  concerned  the  Respondent  because  the
    Appellant had failed to  provide  a  Current  Appointment  Report  from
    Companies House demonstrating that, within the three months immediately
    prior to the date of application the company had been registered (as  a
    new or existing business) and that the Appellant was  registered  as  a
    director (see (d) (iii) of Table 4).

20.  Thus the appeal came before me on 12 August 2014  when  my  first  task
    was to decide whether or not the determination of the First-tier  Judge
    disclosed an error or errors on a point of law that may have materially
    affected the outcome of the appeal.

21.  In terms of the absence of a Current Appointment Report from  Companies
    House, Mr Ahmed submitted that a suitable document  had  been  provided
    (see D1 of the Respondent's bundle before the First-tier Judge)  headed
    "IN01 Incorporation Form" that he submitted provided all the  necessary
    information that would otherwise have been reflected in the  "specified
    document" and whilst  he  accepted  that  it  was  "not  the  specified
    document required" the Appellant had in his application  form  at  G.20
    "ticked the  box  confirming  that  the  specified  document  had  been
    supplied to demonstrate  the  Appellant's  current  registration  as  a
    director".

22.  Mr Ahmed submitted that  saying  that  the  Appellant  would  submit  a
    current report taken together with the fact that he  had  submitted  an
    IN01 form stating that he did apply  to  be  appointed  as  a  director
    "should have put the Respondent on notice  of  the  fact  that  it  was
    missing".

23.  Mr Ahmed notably repeated however that he accepted  "that  he  did  not
    meet the substantive requirement of the Rule".

24.  He thus relied on the provisions of 245AA(d)(i) namely that  it  was  a
    specified document "in the wrong format".

25.  Further, submitted Mr Ahmed, issue  was  taken  with  the  Respondent's
    decision as stated in the refusal letter, that the  Appellant  was  not
    working in an occupation that  appeared  on  the  list  of  occupations
    skilled to National Qualifications Framework Level 4 or  as  stated  in
    the Codes of Practice in Appendix J.  The basis of that conclusion  was
    that in the view of the Respondent, the job title did not appear on the
    list of occupations and in addition from the  evidence  that  had  been
    provided, it was clear to the Respondent that the Appellant was  buying
    and  selling  Electronic  Cigarettes.   This  was  therefore  a  retail
    business  which  was  shown  in  the  Codes  of  Practice  as  National
    Qualifications Framework 3 and not 4.

26.  Mr Ahmed submitted that this was a  misconception  of  the  Appellant's
    business.  It was a marketing name "Nexus Marketing Solutions Limited".
     In that regard further material including a business advertisement had
    been provided to the First-tier Judge at the hearing.

27.  Notably Mr Ahmed did however most fairly accept that he took "on  board
    that my present submissions are not on the point", bearing in mind that
    at paragraph 28 of  the  Judge's  determination,  he  had  referred  to
    Section 85A (4) (a) that prohibited him from considering  any  evidence
    that was not submitted "in support of and at the time  of  making,  the
    application, that the Appellant had made on 19 October 2012".

28.  As I pointed out to Mr. Ahmed,, the First-tier Judge  was  entitled  to
    consider only that evidence, namely the contract with Tasri Limited and
    it was on the basis of that contract, that the Judge was not  satisfied
    that "the business was anything other than the buying  and  selling  of
    electronic cigarettes".

29.  Notably Mr Ahmed again informed me that he "fully took  on  board  that
    my present submissions are not on the point".

30.  Mr Ahmed, who regrettably arrived  late  for  the  hearing  before  me,
    requested an adjournment for the purposes of preparing and submitting a
    draft of amended grounds upon which he would formally seek leave.

31.  That adjournment request was strenuously  opposed  by  Mr  Wilding  who
    maintained that having heard Mr Ahmed's  submissions  it  was  apparent
    that it did not take "this case any further".

32.  The Appellant's application had been refused for four  reasons  all  of
    which were  approved  by  the  First-tier  Judge  within  his  detailed
    determination.  Those four reasons were as follows:

         "1.  There was not a  current  appointment  report  from  Companies
             House - a matter that was accepted.


         2.   The Secretary of State had refused the application  under  the
             NQF 4 which was a requirement  of  Table  4(d)  (iv)  and  the
             Secretary  of  State  had  viewed  the  company  as  a  retail
             business.


         3.   The contract provided for  Tasri  Limited  did  not  show  the
             services provided.


         4.    The  documents  submitted  by  Santander  were  not  in   the
             Appellant's name and  the  bank  had  not  provided  a  letter
             confirming the details required by paragraph 41-SD of Appendix
             A".

33.  Mr Wilding continued that he had noted with  some  concern,  a  concern
    that I shared, Mr Ahmed's reference to the box ticked by the  Appellant
    at G.20 of the application form relating to a specified  document  that
    in the event did not exist at that time.  Above and beyond that, on the
    basis of the box ticked, it arguably amounted to a false representation
    in an application  form  that  raised  a  concern  as  to  whether  the
    Secretary of State should have refused the application under  paragraph
    322(1) of the Rules.

34.  Finally, submitted Mr Wilding, the appeal  had  "been  through  several
    eyes not least the permission to appeal grant of 17 June 2014".   There
    was no reasonable basis under which any such application to  amend  the
    grounds could not have been made in the months  preceding  the  hearing
    before me.  Mr Wilding maintained that "no joy  can  be  had  from  the
    service of such amended grounds".

35.  For like reason I informed Mr Ahmed that I was not satisfied  that  the
    appeal  could  not  be  justly  determined  without  there   being   an
    adjournment and I therefore refused his request.

36.  There was common ground  between  myself  and  the  parties,  that  UTJ
    Freeman had not granted permission to appeal in terms of the  challenge
    to the First-tier Judge's Article 8 ECHR findings.

37.  Having then proceeded with the hearing  and  my  consideration  of  the
    parties' further submissions, I reserved my determination.

Assessment

38.  I have had no difficulty in concluding that the  determination  of  the
    First-tier Judge did not disclose errors on a point of  law  not  least
    such as may have materially affected the outcome of the appeal.

39.  It is apparent  to  me  that  the  Rules  in  this  regard  are  clear.
    Paragraph 41-SD of Appendix A states that an  applicant  will  only  be
    considered to have access  to  funds  if  the  specified  documents  in
    paragraph 41-SD are provided.

40.  In that regard the Appellant had not  provided  a  Current  Appointment
    Report from Companies House as required.

41.  As I pointed out to Mr Ahmed in the course  of  his  submissions,  Form
    IN01 submitted with the Appellant's application clearly stated:

         "This is a summary of the information submitted to Companies  House
         on 27/08/2012.  This document does not indicate that the submission
         has been successful.  You will receive separate  notification  when
         the submission has been accepted or rejected" (Their emphasis).

42.  It is further apparent to me, as indeed it  was  to  the  Secretary  of
    State in refusing the Appellant's application, that the  document  that
    he submitted with his application was not (as he indicated  by  ticking
    box G.20 of his application form) the specified document required under
    the Rules, namely a Companies House Current Appointment Report, but was
    indeed something described as a summary of the information submitted to
    Companies House as regards Nexus Marketing  Solutions  Limited  (indeed
    incorrectly spelt at the heading of the form as "Solilutions").

43.  First and foremost I do not regard that  as  the  same  document  as  a
    Companies House Current Appointment Report but in a  different  format.
    I am reinforced in that conclusion by consideration of  the  fact  that
    the document produced does not include all the information included  in
    the CAR.  It does not, for example, include the date of appointment  as
    a director.  It follows that the document provided by the Appellant and
    upon which he relied, was not a document in the wrong format, it was  a
    different document.

44.  As was observed by Sullivan LJ in Alam and Others v Secretary of  State
    for the Home Department [2012] EWCA Civ 960, whilst a rigid application
    of the Rules may have in some cases, harsh results, that cannot operate
    to undermine a  procedure  designed  to  deal  with  large  numbers  of
    applications in a relatively efficient way.

45.  Of course that is  not  the  only  basis  upon  which  the  Appellant's
    application was rightly refused and his  appeal  subsequently  properly
    dismissed.

46.  I observed in the course of the hearing before me  that  Mr  Ahmed,  in
    taking issue with the finding that on the evidence  the  Appellant  had
    provided it was  clear  that  he  was  buying  and  selling  Electronic
    Cigarettes, drew my attention to an advertisement of the company in the
    bundle before the First-tier Judge at page 20.  Quite  apart  from  the
    fact that the Judge quite properly refused to  consider  this  evidence
    mindful of the provisions of Section 85A(4)(a) I  could  not  help  but
    observe, that contrary to Mr Ahmed's contention that  the  company  was
    wider-based, that the opening remarks of the advertisement stated inter
    alia:

         "Nexus Trading specialises in the distribution of  e-cigarettes  in
         the UK.  The company currently deals in  three  e-cigarette  brands
         namely  ...   Nexus  Trading  focuses  on   providing   specialised
         innovative and customer-centric solutions.  ...


         We are  the  choice  distributor  of  [the  three  companies  named
         therein] brands of e-cigarettes."

47.  So apart from the failure to provide a CAR  -  the  specified  document
    required by the Rules that Mr Ahmed (subject to  his  reliance  on  the
    provisions of paragraph 245AA(b)(ii)) accepted, the  Appellant  clearly
    failed to comply with the requirement of Table 4(d)(iv) because, on the
    evidence submitted with the Appellant's application, it was apparent to
    the Respondent that the company was "a retail  business  shown  in  the
    Codes of Practice as NQF 3 and not Level 4 or above as required."

48.  Further it was apparent that the contract provided for the company  did
    not show the services provided as required by the Rules.   In  addition
    the documents submitted by Santander Bank were not in  the  Appellant's
    name.  The bank had not provided a letter that the funds were available
    to the Appellant in compliance with the provisions of 41-SD(a)(i).

49.  Further and as the Judge rightly pointed out in terms at  paragraph  26
    of his determination, an entrepreneur has to invest the money  he  says
    he is going to invest.  If the money is not in his control  he  has  to
    show it will entirely be under his control and that is  why  either  he
    produces a letter stating it is available to him (paragraph  41-SD  (a)
    (i)) or there is a declaration from  the  banker  of  the  third  party
    together with  a  letter  from  a  legal  representative  vouching  the
    validity of the signature.  No such evidence was provided.

50.  As Mr Wilding  rightly  observed,  in  any  event,  if  the  money  was
    available for the Appellant to use why was it not transferred  to  him.
    It would then be in a bank account in his own name.

51.  As the  Judge  further  and  rightly  found  at  paragraph  26  of  his
    determination, evidential flexibility did not take  the  Appellant  any
    further.

52.   In  that  regard  I  had  drawn  the  parties'  attention  to  Durrani
    (Entrepreneurs: bank letters; evidential flexibility) [2014] UKUT 00295
    (IAC) that held inter alia that:

         "The question of whether a policy exists is one of fact.  There  is
         no evidence that some policy on evidential flexibility, independent
         and freestanding of paragraph 245AA, survived the  introduction  of
         that paragraph in the Immigration Rules".


53.  Upon my reading of the determination as a whole I find that  it  cannot
    even arguably be said that the First-tier Judge failed to take relevant
    material into account or that his decision was perverse  or  irrational
    in the Wednesbury sense. This  is  not  a  case  where  the  first-tier
    Judge's reasoning was such that the Tribunal were unable to  understand
    the thought processes that he employed in reaching his decision. I find
    that the Judge properly identified and recorded the matters critical to
    his decision on the material matters raised before him in  the  appeal.
    The findings that he made were clearly open to him on the evidence  and
    thus sustainable in law.

Conclusion

54.  The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law and  I  order  that  it  shall
    stand.


Signed                                  Date 20 August 2014
