Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr I Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms S Nowaparast of NLS Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. I make an anonymity order under  rule  14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (SI  2008/2698  as  amended)  in  order  to
    protect  the  anonymity  of  the  appellant's  children.   This   order
    prohibits the disclosure  directly  or  indirectly  (including  by  the
    parties) of the identity of any of the appellant.  Any  disclosure  and
    breach of this order may amount to a contempt  of  court.   This  order
    shall remain in force unless revoked or varied by a Tribunal or Court.

 2. Although this is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a decision
    of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  allowing  the  appellant's  appeal,  for
    convenience I will refer to the parties as  they  appeared  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

Introduction

 3. The appellant is a citizen of Somalia who was born on 5 April 1989.  He
    came to the United Kingdom in 2003, together with his mother,  when  he
    was 14 years old.  In February 2003,  the  appellant's  mother  claimed
    asylum with the appellant  as  her  dependant.   That  application  was
    refused in June 2003 and a subsequent appeal was dismissed.

 4. It appears from the Secretary of State's decision letter dated  23  May
    2014  that  the  appellant,  together  with  his  family,  was  granted
    indefinite leave to remain on 29 January 2008.

 5. Subsequent to that,  the  appellant  committed  a  number  of  criminal
    offences.  On 18 August 2008,  he  was  convicted  at  the  South  East
    Suffolk Magistrates' Court of burglary and ordered to pay  compensation
    of �538.  On 15 May 2010 at  the  Cardiff  Magistrates'  Court  he  was
    convicted of possession of class B drugs (cannabis) and fined �75.

 6. On 15 December 2010, the appellant was sentenced at the Crown Court for
    two offences of burglary and unlawful wounding for  which  he  received
    terms of imprisonment of twelve months and sixteen months  respectively
    to run consecutively.  The total sentence was, therefore,  one  of  two
    years and four months imprisonment.

 7. On 18 February 2010, the appellant was informed that he was  liable  to
    deportation under  the  automatic  deportation  provisions  of  the  UK
    Borders Act 2007.

 8. On 14 March 2011, the appellant made  an  application  for  asylum  and
    further submissions were made on  his  behalf  seeking  to  resist  his
    deportation.   Subsequently,  the  appellant   attended   a   screening
    interview on 2 June 2011.  On 29 September 2011, the appellant informed
    the Home Office that he did not wish to pursue his asylum claim.  On 10
    February 2012, his legal representatives indicated that he only  wished
    to pursue his case under Arts 2, 3 and 8 of the ECHR.  On  11  February
    2013, the appellant confirmed that he did not wish to claim asylum  but
    relied on Art 8.

 9. On 23 May 2014, the Secretary of State refused  the  appellant's  claim
    under Arts 2 and 3 of the ECHR and for  humanitarian  protection  under
    para 338C of the Immigration Rules (Statement of Changes in Immigration
    Rules, HC 395  as  amended).   In  addition,  the  Secretary  of  State
    concluded that the appellant could not succeed under paras 398, 399 and
    399A of the Rules  and  there  were  no  exceptional  circumstances  to
    justify the  grant  of  leave  outside  the  Rules.   Consequently  the
    Secretary of State made a decision that s.32(5) of the UK  Borders  Act
    2007 applied and that  the  appellant  was  subject  to  the  automatic
    deportation provision of the 2007 Act.  On 7 May  2014,  a  deportation
    order was made against the appellant.

The Appeal

10. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  In a  determination
    promulgated on 23 December 2014, Judge Britton allowed the  appellant's
    appeal on the basis that his deportation would  breach  Art  8  of  the
    ECHR.

11. The Secretary of  State  sought  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal.  The Secretary of State relied on three grounds.  First,  the
    judge had failed to apply para A362 of the Immigration Rules and  apply
    the amended Rules in effect from 28 July 2014 and in force at the  date
    of the hearing.  Secondly, the judge had wrongly applied s.117C of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  ("NIA  Act  2002"),  in
    particular 'Exception 2' in s.117C(5) in concluding that the effect  on
    the appellant's partner and children would be "unduly harsh" if he  was
    deported.  Thirdly, the judge had erred in law in  assessing  the  best
    interests of the appellant's children and in concluding that  it  would
    be unduly  harsh  to  expect  the  appellant's  wife  and  children  to
    integrate into Somali society and had failed to have sufficient  regard
    to the public interest.

12. On 19 January 2015, the First-tier Tribunal  (Judge  Chambers)  granted
    the Secretary of State permission to appeal.

13. The appeal first came before me on 2 June 2015.  In a decision dated 18
    June 2015, I found that the First-tier Tribunal's decision involved the
    making of an error of  law  and  the  judge's  decision  to  allow  the
    appellant's appeal under Art 8 could not stand.  I  set  that  decision
    aside and directed that the appeal be relisted for  a  resumed  hearing
    before me in order to remake the decision under Art 8 of the ECHR.

The Resumed Hearing

14. The resumed hearing was listed before me on 2 September 2015.

15. At that hearing, the appellant was again represented by  Ms  Nowaparast
    and the respondent by Mr Richards.

16. At the outset of the hearing, Mr Richards accepted  that  it  would  be
    "unduly harsh" for the appellant's wife and children to go  to  Somalia
    and live there.  He accepted, therefore, that  the  appellant  met  the
    requirement in para 399(a)(ii)(a) and 399(b)(ii).  Both Mr Richards and
    Ms Nowaparast accepted that the sole issue in the appeal was whether it
    was "unduly harsh" for the appellant's children to remain in the UK  if
    the appellant were deported (para 399(a)(ii)(b)) or it would be "unduly
    harsh" for his partner to remain in the UK if he  were  deported  (para
    399(b)(iii)).

17. On behalf of the appellant, Ms Nowaparast relied upon  the  appellant's
    witness statement dated 2 December 2014 and  the  oral  evidence  given
    before Judge Britton both by the appellant and his wife.  In  addition,
    the appellant and his wife gave brief oral evidence before me.

18. Further, Ms Nowaparast handed up to me a letter from the Department  of
    Works and Pensions  dated  27  February  2015  which  showed  that  the
    appellant received a carer's allowance as  the  primary  carer  of  his
    mother who lives  with  the  appellant,  his  wife  and  two  children.
    Finally, Ms Nowaparast handed up to me a bundle  of  medical  documents
    which showed that the appellant's wife is currently pregnant and  their
    baby is due in the beginning of October.

The Relevant Rules

19. Paragraph 398 of the Immigration Rules, so far as relevant, provides as
    follows:

         "Where a person claims that their deportation would be contrary  to
         the  UK's  obligations  under  Article  8  of  the   Human   Rights
         Convention, and

         ....

         (b)  the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to  the
             public good and in the public interest because they have  been
             convicted of an offence for which they have been sentenced  to
             a period of imprisonment of less than 4 years but at least  12
             months;

         ....

         the Secretary of  State  in  assessing  that  claim  will  consider
         whether paragraph 399 or 399A applies and,  if  it  does  not,  the
         public interest in deportation will only  be  outweighed  by  other
         factors where there are  very  compelling  circumstances  over  and
         above those described in paragraphs 399 and 399A."

20. In this appeal, the appellant  relies  upon  para  399(a)  and  (b)  in
    respect of his "genuine and subsisting" relationship with his  children
    in the UK and with his partner.  Paragraph 399 provides as follows:

         "399. This paragraph applies where paragraph 398 (b) or (c) applies
             if -

         (a)  the person has a genuine and subsisting parental  relationship
             with a child under the age of 18 years who is in the UK, and

             (i)  the child is a British Citizen; or

             (ii) the child has lived in the UK continuously for  at  least
                  the  7  years  immediately  preceding  the  date  of   the
                  immigration decision; and in either case

                  (a)  it would be unduly harsh for the child to live in the
                      country to which the person is to be deported; and

                  (b)  it would be unduly harsh for the child to  remain  in
                      the UK without the person who is to be deported; or

         (b)  the person has a genuine and subsisting  relationship  with  a
             partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen  or  settled
             in the UK, and

             (i)  the relationship was formed at a  time  when  the  person
                  (deportee) was in the UK lawfully  and  their  immigration
                  status was not precarious; and

             (ii) it would be unduly harsh for that partner to live in  the
                  country to which the person is to be deported, because  of
                  compelling circumstances over and above those described in
                  paragraph EX.2. of Appendix FM; and

             (iii)    it would be unduly harsh for that partner  to  remain
                  in the UK without the person who  is  to  be  deported.  "
                  (Emphasis added.)

21. As I have already indicated, it is para 399(a)(ii)(b) and  399(b)(iii),
    which I have emphasised above, which are relied upon by the appellant.

The Submissions

22. On behalf of the respondent, Mr Richards submitted that the  issue  was
    whether, if the appellant were deported, the fact that his partner  and
    children would remain in the UK would be "unduly harsh"  to  them.   He
    referred me, in particular, to the Upper  Tribunal's  decision  in  MAB
    (Paragraph 399:  "unduly harsh")  USA  [2015]  UKUT  00435  (IAC).   He
    submitted that the Upper Tribunal have decided that whether the  effect
    on a partner or children would be "unduly  harsh"  did  not  require  a
    balancing of the consequences to  them  against  the  public  interest.
    Rather, it required an assessment of whether the impact upon them would
    be "inordinately" harsh or "unusually large" or "excessive".  That test
    was, Mr Richards submitted, not to be equated with whether  the  impact
    would be 'uncomfortable', 'inconvenient' or 'challenging'.  Mr Richards
    submitted that no doubt life for the appellant's partner  and  children
    would be difficult and challenging in  his  absence.   He  acknowledged
    that the appellant's partner, as she had told me in her evidence, found
    life difficult and challenging when the appellant was in prison but she
    had clearly coped and he submitted that there was no reason to  believe
    she and the children could not do so  in  the  appellant's  absence  if
    deported to Somalia.

23. Mr Richards submitted that  on  the  evidence  the  appellant  was  not
    working at the present time and so there was no  financial  support  to
    the appellant's partner and children which would be missed.  He further
    submitted that there was no reason why the family could not  remain  in
    contact  using  modern  methods  of  communication,  for  example   the
    telephone and Skype.  He submitted that there was no objective evidence
    before the Tribunal that Skype was not accessible  in  Somalia  despite
    the appellant's evidence that he did not think that it was.

24. Mr Richards invited me to find that while the  appellant's  deportation
    would be unwelcome and challenging for his family, the consequences  to
    them did not cross the heightened threshold of being "unduly harsh".

25.  On  behalf  of  the  appellant,  Ms  Nowaparast  submitted  that   the
    consequences to the appellant's partner  and  children  did  cross  the
    threshold of being "unduly harsh".  She submitted that it  was  in  the
    children's best interests to be cared for by  both  their  parents  and
    that, at best, if the appellant were deported,  continued  contact  for
    the foreseeable future could only be over the  telephone  or  internet.
    She accepted there was no evidence that internet access was not readily
    available in Somalia.  She submitted that, in effect, deportation would
    remove all physical contact between  the  children  and  their  father.
    Visits to Somalia were practically impossible and she reminded me  that
    the Foreign and Commonwealth  Office  advised  against  all  travel  to
    Somalia by British citizens.  She submitted that  it  was  not  in  the
    children's best interest to  be  denied  physical  contact  with  their
    father.  Ms Nowaparast submitted that even if the  appellant's  partner
    had coped whilst he was in prison, the  situation  was  now  different.
    There were now two children -  one  nearly  5  and  one  2  -  and  the
    appellant's partner was about to give birth to their third child.   The
    level of support needed was stronger now than when the appellant was in
    prison.  She  submitted  that  the  appellant's  partner  had,  in  her
    evidence, emphasised how dependent she and the children were  upon  the
    appellant.  She also pointed out that the appellant's sister and mother
    lived with the family and that dependance also had  to  be  taken  into
    account.  She submitted that the  lack  of  physical  contact  was  not
    temporary and could be for an indefinite period and so the consequences
    of separation were "unduly harsh".

Discussion and Findings

26. The burden of proof  is  upon  the  appellant  to  establish  that  his
    deportation to Somalia would breach Art 8 and, therefore, that he falls
    within Exception 1 set out in s.33(2) of the UK Borders Act 2007.   The
    appellant must establish that breach on a balance of probabilities.

27. In applying Art  8,  I  must  adopt  the  two-stage  approach:   first,
    considering whether  the  appellant  can  succeed  under  the  relevant
    Immigration Rules, namely para 399; and secondly, if he cannot, whether
    he has established "very  compelling  circumstances"  over  and  above,
    those described in para 399 (see MF (Nigeria) v SSHD  [2013]  EWCA  Civ
    1192 and Singh and Khalid v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 74).   In  considering
    that second stage the Tribunal is  carrying  out  the  "proportionality
    assessment" under Art 8.2 and is  required  to  "have  regard"  to  the
    factors set out in ss.117B and 117C of the Nationality, Immigration and
    Asylum Act 2002 (as amended by the Immigration Act 2014).

28. The proper interpretation of the phrase "unduly harsh" was addressed by
    the Upper Tribunal in MAB.  The essential conclusions of the UT are set
    out in the headnote as follows:

         "1.  The phrase 'unduly harsh'  in  para  399  of  the  Rules  (and
             s.117C(5) of  the  2002  Act)  does  not  import  a  balancing
             exercise requiring the public interest to be  weighed  against
             the circumstances of the individual (whether child or  partner
             of the deportee).  The focus is solely upon an  evaluation  of
             the consequences and impact upon the individual concerned.

         2.   Whether the consequences of deportation will be 'unduly harsh'
             for  an  individual   involves   more   than   'uncomfortable,
             inconvenient, undesirable, unwelcome or merely  difficult  and
             challenging' consequences  and  imposes  a  considerably  more
             elevated or higher threshold.

         3.   The consequences for an individual will be 'harsh' if they are
             'severe' or 'bleak' and they will be 'unduly' so if  they  are
             'inordinately' or 'excessively' harsh taking into  account  of
             all the circumstances of the individual."

29. I turn now to the evidence and my factual findings.

30. The appellant is a citizen of Somalia who arrived in the  UK  with  his
    mother in 2003 when he was 14 years old.   On  14  November  2009,  the
    appellant married his wife, H.  They have two children, a son  who  was
    born on 5 December 2010 (aged 4) and a daughter  who  was  born  on  13
    March 2013 (aged 2).

31. I have set out earlier the  appellant's  criminal  record.   The  index
    offence for  which  he  is  subject  to  deportation  resulted  in  his
    conviction on 15 December 2010 at the Crown Court for two  offences  of
    burglary and  unlawful  wounding  for  which  he  received  consecutive
    sentences of  twelve  months  and  sixteen  months  respectively.   The
    appellant was released from prison in February 2012.

32. The appellant's wife and children  are  British  citizens.   They  have
    never been to Somalia.  The appellant's wife is currently pregnant with
    their third child which is due to be born in October of this year.

33. The appellant's parents and siblings all live in the UK.   His  parents
    are separated.  His father lives in London together with his  siblings,
    apart from his 15 year old sister.  The appellant's mother  lives  with
    the appellant, his wife and children.  She is disabled and he  receives
    carer's allowance as her primary carer.  Recently, the  appellant's  15
    year old sister came to live with the appellant and  his  family.   His
    sister attends school locally.

34. The appellant's evidence is that he is deeply sorry  for  his  actions.
    His wife stood by him when he was in prison.  The evidence  before  the
    judge, and given orally by the appellant before  me,  was  that  he  is
    employed as a driver for a Chinese  takeaway  and  also  works,  albeit
    intermittently, as a translator.  He told me that for  the  driving  he
    received �150 plus a carer's allowance of between �60 and �65 per week.
     When he was working as a translator, he was able to earn �25 an  hour.
    He told me that, apart from child benefits, neither  he  nor  his  wife
    were in receipt of public funds.

35. The appellant's wife, however, gave slightly different  evidence.   She
    told me that the appellant had worked but recently he had  ceased  work
    because he had hurt his hand.  She told me that she was in  receipt  of
    employment support allowance and he also received benefits.

36. Both the appellant and his wife gave evidence about the impact  of  the
    appellant being deported.   The  appellant  said  it  would  feel  like
    "someone had passed away" and would "destroy us in every meaning of the
    word".  He said that his family could not see  themselves  without  him
    and he could not see himself without them.  In  cross-examination,  the
    appellant said that he did not think it would be possible  to  keep  in
    contact by Skype from Mogadishu.

37. The appellant's wife gave clear, and at times emotional, evidence  that
    she  and  her  children  needed  the  support  of  the  appellant.   In
    particular, their son would be affected.  They had  been  together  for
    six years and she could not think of being without the appellant.   She
    said she did not get much support from her family and would not be able
    to cope without him.  In addition to their current children,  she  said
    that she was pregnant with their third child and  needed  his  help  in
    order to cope.  She said that the appellant  was  remorseful;  everyone
    made mistakes.  She said that the appellant was  her  "backbone".   She
    did not want her son to grow up without  a  father  who  needed  to  be
    there.  When asked in cross-examination about how she had coped  whilst
    the appellant was in prison, his wife said that  it  had  been  "really
    hard".  Her family had not really  been  there  for  her  and  she  did
    everything she could to go and see the appellant.

38. The genuineness of the relationship between the appellant and his  wife
    and between the appellant and  his  children  was  not  doubted  by  Mr
    Richards.  It is clear to me, having heard both the appellant  and  his
    wife give evidence, that their family relationships are deep and  rich.
    They form  a  family  unit  of  mutual  support  and  dependence.   The
    appellant is an integral part of the family providing  strong  parental
    support for his children and spousal support for his wife.

39. I found the appellant's wife to be a truthful and  compelling  witness.
    I accept her evidence in its totality.  Although there were differences
    between  her  evidence  and  the  appellant's  as  to  his  employment,
    accepting what she said,  I  find  that  the  appellant  is  no  longer
    employed but that is a recent event caused by  his  circumstances.   He
    has clearly until the recent past obtained  gainful  employment  and  I
    have no reason to doubt that he would do so in the  future  to  support
    his family.  Were he deported, the appellant's wife and children  would
    be deprived of the breadwinner of the family.

40. I also accept the evidence of the  appellant's  wife  (and  indeed  the
    appellant), that the effect of the  appellant's  deportation  would  be
    particularly devastating  to  his  children.   It  is  clearly,  in  my
    judgment, in the children's best interests to be  brought  up  by  both
    their caring parents.  The appellant has shown commitment to  his  wife
    and children since being released from prison in  February  2013,  over
    two and a half years  ago.   On  all  the  evidence  before  me,  I  am
    satisfied that during that time the appellant's son has formed a  close
    relationship and bond within the family with his father.  Likewise, his
    second child was born during this time and has, for the last two years,
    lived with the appellant as part of the family unit.  The effect of the
    appellant's deportation will, in my view, be to deprive  both  children
    of physical contact with their father for the foreseeable  future.   It
    is accepted by Mr Richards that  it  would  be  unduly  harsh  for  the
    appellant's wife and children to live in Somalia.  In my  judgment,  it
    would also be unreasonable (and beyond proper  expectation)  to  expect
    the appellant's wife and children to visit  the  appellant  in  Somalia
    given the situation in that country and  the  FCO's  advice,  which  Mr
    Richards did not challenge, advising British citizens not to travel  to
    Somalia.

41. The effect would, therefore, be if the appellant  were  deported,  that
    the children would  be  deprived  of  any  real  paternal  contact  and
    influence.  The appellant has committed no further offences since 2010,
    in particular,  since  his  release  in  February  2012.   It  was  not
    suggested  by  Mr  Richards  that  he  presented  any  real   risk   of
    reoffending.  His influence and support of both his children  and  wife
    is, in my judgment, positive and beneficial.  I accept that there is no
    evidence that the appellant would  not  be  able  to  keep  in  contact
    through modern electronic means, in particular Skype, with his wife and
    children.  Over a short period  of  time,  that  may  be  a  reasonable
    equivalent to direct physical contact with family members.  It is  not,
    however, a reasonable substitute for physical contact between a  father
    and child (or indeed husband and wife) over an extended period of  time
    such as would be the case if the appellant were deported.

42. In my judgment, any meaningful relationship between the  appellant  and
    his wife or the appellant and his children would be  destroyed  by  his
    deportation.  His wife would lose  his  support  both  emotionally  and
    financially in raising,  what  will  shortly  be,  a  family  of  three
    children.  The burden upon his wife will, no doubt, be added to by  the
    presence of her mother-in-law living in  the  house.   There  is  every
    likelihood that the appellant's wife would  become  her  carer  in  the
    appellant's absence.  The presence  of  the  appellant's  15  year  old
    sister is, in my view, less significant since I see no reason  why  she
    could not return to live with her father in London as she had  done  so
    until recently.

43. Applying the approach in MAB, I am satisfied that the impact  upon  the
    appellant's wife and his children if he were deported would be  "unduly
    harsh"  in  that  the  impact  upon  them  would  be  inordinately   or
    excessively harsh given the nature and longevity  of  the  interference
    with their ability to live as a family unit.

44. For these  reasons,  I  am  satisfied  that  the  appellant  meets  the
    requirements in paras 399(a) and 399(b).

45. On that basis, the appellant has established that his deportation would
    breach Art 8.

Decision

46. For the reasons given in my decision of 18 June 2015, the  decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal to allow the appellant's  appeal  under  Art  8
    involved the making of an error of law.  That  decision  has  been  set
    aside.

47. I remake the decision, allowing the appellant's appeal under Art  8  of
    the ECHR.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

No fee is payable and so I make no fee award.
