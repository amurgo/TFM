                            DECISION AND REASONS

Anonymity order
The Court of Appeal made an anonymity order in  this  appeal.     I continue
that order pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
Rules 2008: unless the Upper Tribunal  or  a  Court  directs  otherwise,  no
report of these  proceedings  or  any  form  of  publication  thereof  shall
identify the original appellant or his family members, whether  directly  or
indirectly. This order applies to, amongst others, all parties. Any  failure
to comply with this order could give rise to contempt of court proceedings.

 1. This appeal returns to the Upper Tribunal  from  the  Court  of  Appeal
    which in a judgment reported as NA (Pakistan) and others v Secretary of
    State for the Home Department [2016] EWCA Civ 662 allowed the Secretary
    of State's appeal against the decision of the  Upper  Tribunal  setting
    aside the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  dismissing  his  appeal
    against deportation and substituting a decision to allow the appeal  on
    Article 8 ECHR grounds,  with  reference  to  section  117C(6)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (as amended).

 2. The appellant has been found to be a citizen of Angola, though  he  now
    claims to be stateless.  He has never made a statelessness claim to the
    respondent.

Background

 3. The appellant came to the United Kingdom in 1989, age 7,  and  suffered
    abuse and neglect such that he was taken from the 'uncle'  who  brought
    him here and brought up in care.  He told Dr Joanne Lackenby,  who  has
    prepared psychological assessments throughout these  proceedings,  that
    as a teenager he carried a knife for protection.

 4. His first known offence was committed when he was  15.   The  appellant
    said he had retaliated to racial  abuse.   On  28  June  1998,  he  was
    sentenced to a 12-month supervision  order  and  �50  compensation  for
    possession of an article with a blade in a  public  place  and  assault
    occasioning actual bodily harm.

 5. On 10 September 1999, aged 17, the appellant was convicted  of  robbery
    and sentenced to a 2-year conditional discharge and  �100  compensation
    order, for taking a person's wallet and phone.  He denied  having  used
    force.

 6. On 20 July 2000, now age 18, the appellant was convicted  of  having  a
    bladed article in a public place, theft, and  assault  with  intent  to
    resist  arrest;  he  had  taken  someone's  wallet.   His   conditional
    discharge was revoked and he was sentenced  to  15-months  in  a  young
    offender institution.

 7. On 8 November 2002, with another defendant, the appellant was sentenced
    to 10 years imprisonment for aggravated burglary, while suffering  from
    crack cocaine use and withdrawal.  The appellant had a drug  habit  and
    had run out of supplies that morning; they wanted the money for  drugs.
    He and three other men had set out  to  rob  an  Asian  man  whom  they
    thought was a drug dealer who would have both drugs and money at  home.
    They entered his flat in London as trespassers, intending to burgle the
    flat and rob the owner.  They attempted to force him to tell them where
    the money was, in front of his wife and children.  Only one  other  man
    was tried with the appellant, the  other  two  were  not  traced.   The
    sentencing Judge treated them as equally culpable.

 8. The appellant was released on licence in 2008.  On 31 October 2015,  he
    committed an offence of robbery, entering a bookmakers with  two  other
    men.  They all left,  then  the  appellant  returned,  leapt  over  the
    counter shouting 'give me the fucking money' and  took  a  quantity  of
    money from the tills and a purse from a handbag, belonging to a  member
    of staff.  On his way out, he headbutted one of the other men, which he
    claimed not to remember but was clear on the closed circuit  television
    cameras.   He was under the influence of crack cocaine and alcohol.  He
    used the money to pay a loan shark  to  whom  he  owed  money.  He  was
    sentenced to 42 months (3 years 6 months) imprisonment  and  electronic
    tagging, both while on bail before the trial in April 2017,  and  after
    his release in August 2018.

 9. The appellant's accepted history is  set  out  in  the  NA  and  others
    decision at [64]-[69] (I have anonymised the names of his  partner  and
    the 'uncle' who brought him to the United Kingdom:

         "64. KJ is a national of Angola,  born  on  2  June  1982.  He  was
         brought to the UK in December 1990, aged 8, by a man [the  'uncle']
         who posed as his father. There was a report when KJ was aged 9 that
         [the 'uncle'] had abused him, and he was taken into foster care for
         a while. But he  was  then  returned  to  [the  'uncle'],  who  was
         believed to  be  his  father.  There  was  further  abuse  by  [the
         'uncle']. At the age of about 13 KJ was  taken  into  care.  On  12
         November 1997, at the age of 15, he was granted indefinite leave to
         remain.

         65.  From 1997 KJ started getting into trouble and began committing
         offences. In March 1998  he  was  convicted  of  possession  of  an
         article with a blade and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. In
         June 1998 he committed a robbery whilst on bail. On 20 July 2000 he
         was sentenced for an offence of having a bladed article, theft  and
         resisting arrest and sentenced to 15 months' detention in  a  young
         offenders' institution. On 7 November 2002 KJ was sentenced  to  10
         years' detention in a young  offenders'  institution  for  a  grave
         offence of aggravated burglary committed with three others, who had
         together entered a flat during the night, tied up the occupant  and
         assaulted him (one of them stabbing him) in an attempt to make  him
         divulge where money was kept. KJ was 19 at the  time  he  committed
         this offence. The length of KJ's sentence means that this is  again
         a case to which section 117C(6) applies.

         66.   While  in  detention,  KJ  began  a  relationship  with  [his
         partner], who visited him in prison from about the end of 2003.

         67.  On 11 December 2007, the Secretary of State made a deportation
         order in  respect  of  KJ.  KJ's  appeal  against  that  order  was
         dismissed on 12 November 2007. However, he was not deported at that
         stage because of difficulties in obtaining  a  travel  document  to
         send him to Angola.

         68.  In October 2008 KJ was released from immigration detention  on
         bail to reside at the home of [his partner's] mother. Initially  he
         reported in  accordance  with  his  bail  conditions,  but  fearing
         deportation in October 2010 he absconded.

         69.  In March 2013 [his  partner]  was  pregnant  by  KJ  and  KJ's
         solicitors wrote to the Secretary of State with representations and
         evidence and offering to report to the immigration  authorities  on
         condition that he was not detained. The evidence included a  report
         dated 15 September 2012 from a consultant  psychiatrist,  Professor
         Cornelius  Katona,  which  assessed  KJ  to   be   suffering   from
         depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder  (PTSD)  and
         to be at risk of suicide if returned  to  Angola.  KJ  was  sent  a
         reporting notice and on 25 March 2013 commenced reporting again. On
         31 March 2013 KJ's and [his partner]'s daughter was born."

10. On 12 September 2013, the Secretary of  State  refused  to  revoke  the
    deportation order.  The appellant appealed to the  First-tier  Tribunal
    which allowed his appeal, finding it probable that  the  appellant  had
    some relatives in Angola, but that since he had been  so  long  in  the
    United Kingdom, it could not be assumed that they would support him  to
    build a new life there.  The Upper Tribunal set aside the decision  for
    failure to refer to paragraphs 398 and 399A of  the  Immigration  Rules
    and proceeded to remake the decision.

11. The Upper Tribunal gave very great weight to the appellant's  offending
    history, which had attracted a sentence of 10  years'  detention  in  a
    Young Offenders' Institution.  The Tribunal found that it would not  be
    reasonable to expect the appellant's partner and their (elder) daughter
    to go with the appellant to Angola, but that those  factors  alone  did
    not outweigh  the  public  interest  in  his  deportation.   The  Upper
    Tribunal considered Exception 1 to section 117C and the Court of Appeal
    accepted that the Upper Tribunal had been entitled to find that he  had
    no familial ties in Angola of any materiality.

12. The Upper Tribunal allowed the appeal under  section  117C(6),  finding
    that there were very compelling circumstances which warranted  allowing
    his appeal against deportation.  The Secretary of State appealed to the
    Court of Appeal.

13. Meanwhile, on 30 June 2015, the couple had a second child, a  daughter;
    the appellant's partner (his fianc�e) was supporting the  whole  family
    but she was earning less on maternity leave, and going  through  a  job
    restructure.  She had fallen behind with rent and council tax  and  was
    receiving letters threatening eviction.  She tried to keep  the  matter
    from the appellant, but when he discovered a letter from  the  landlord
    threatening proceedings, the appellant was very upset,  partly  because
    he had not been told of the problems.

14. During 2015, the appellant attempted suicide again, going  out  in  his
    pyjamas, heading for a motorway  bridge.   The  police  found  him  and
    talked him into getting into a police car.  He broke down and said that
    his girlfriend would  be  better  off  without  him  as  he  could  not
    contribute to the family (he was  not  allowed  to  work)  and  he  had
    nothing to offer.  He was admitted to the local mental health unit  and
    assessed, then sent home.

15. On 31 October 2015,  the  appellant  committed  a  further  offence  of
    robbery, for which he was sentenced on  4  April  2017  to  42  months'
    imprisonment.  He served  16  months  of  that  sentence  before  being
    release in August 2018.

Court of Appeal judgment

16. The analysis of the Upper Tribunal's judgment in the  Court  of  Appeal
    continued:

         "76. ... He had no ties with Angola and no communication skills, so
         removal there would be to an alien environment without any  support
         system at all; and this had to be added to his  mental  state,  and
         the risk it would deteriorate, so that  he  would  be  at  risk  of
         depression,  worsening  symptoms  of  PTSD,  drug-taking  and  even
         committing suicide if deported, as explained  by  Professor  Katona
         and Ms Lackenby in their reports: paras. [43]-[51].

         77.   The  Tribunal  noted  that  counsel  for  KJ  canvassed   the
         possibility of an Article 3 ECHR claim against  deportation  by  KJ
         based on his risk  of  suicide,  but  did  not  develop  this.  The
         Tribunal noted that the Secretary of State in her  decision  letter
         of 12 September 2013 stated that  Angola  had  relevant  drugs  and
         medical treatment available, but dismissed this as an  answer:  "It
         is hard to see how a man with no language skills  and  no  familial
         ties in Angola could avail himself of the limited healthcare there"
         (para. [47]).

         78.  The Upper Tribunal correctly directed itself as  to  the  test
         applicable under section 117C(6). It also correctly recognised that
         the strength of KJ's claim to fall  within  Exception  1  could  in
         principle furnish grounds on which it might be said that there were
         "very compelling circumstances over and above  those  described  in
         Exceptions 1 and 2".

         79.  However, Mr Tam submits that the Tribunal erred in the  weight
         it placed upon the medical evidence  in  KJ's  case.  The  Tribunal
         ought to have considered  KJ's  case  based  on  Article  3  first,
         against the very high threshold required to be satisfied for such a
         claim to be made out, and should have found that KJ's case  clearly
         did not meet that test: see GS (India) v Secretary of State for the
         Home Department [2015] EWCA Civ 40 for a detailed recent discussion
         of the relevant  authorities.  The  Tribunal  ought  then  to  have
         addressed the question  whether  the  lesser  standard  of  medical
         treatment which might  be  available  in  Angola  impacted  in  any
         relevant way on his family life or private life  interests  in  the
         UK, bearing in mind that a similar rigorous standard  of  relevance
         of difference in medical treatment is applicable in the context  of
         a claim under Article 8 as it is in the context of  a  claim  under
         Article  3,  since  both  Articles  reflect  in  that  respect   an
         underlying principle

             "that  the  ECHR  does  not  impose  any  obligation  on   the
             contracting states to provide those liable to deportation with
             medical treatment lacking  in  their  'home  countries'.  This
             principle applies even where the consequence will be that  the
             deportee's life  will  be  significantly  shortened  ..."  (MM
             (Zimbabwe) [2012] EWCA Civ 279, [17]-[18] per  Moses  LJ;  see
             also GS (India)  at  [85]-[87]  per  Laws  LJ  and  [111]  per
             Underhill LJ).

         80.  In our judgment, this criticism of the Upper Tribunal judgment
         is made out. The Tribunal erred in law by failing to direct  itself
         properly regarding the stringency of the test to  be  applied  when
         considering  whether  a  difference  in  availability  of   medical
         treatment as between Angola and the UK could play  any  significant
         role in bolstering KJ's claim to have  the  deportation  order  set
         aside, let alone whether it could make any significant contribution
         to  establishing   that   there   were   other   "very   compelling
         circumstances" for the purposes of section 117C(6).

         81.  We therefore allow the appeal on this ground and remit  it  to
         the Upper Tribunal for the decision to be re-made. This  is  not  a
         case in which it can be said that KJ's appeal  against  deportation
         must necessarily succeed or must necessarily fail."

17. The appeal was remitted to the Upper Tribunal on that basis.

Upper Tribunal hearing 2018

18. Pursuant to the decision of the Court of Appeal in NA and  others,  the
    appeal was listed for hearing on 16 August 2018.  On 9 July  2018,  the
    appellant's then representatives, Legal Rights Partnership  solicitors,
    wrote to the Upper Tribunal, giving  paragraph  15(2A)  notice  of  his
    intention to rely on updated evidence, as the last First-tier  Tribunal
    decision in this appeal was in 2014 based on evidence  dating  back  to
    2013.

19. The appellant sought an adjournment because he wished to submit updated
    witness statements, an up-to-date  psychiatric  report  from  Professor
    Katona, an updated forensic psychologist's report from Joanne Lackenby,
    and an updated Independent Social Worker report from Judi Lyons, all of
    whom had previously provided expert reports  on  his  behalf  and  were
    willing to do so again.

20. On 10 July 2018, Upper Tribunal Judge Plimmer granted  an  adjournment,
    directing that the appellant file and serve all evidence relied upon in
    one comprehensive indexed and paginated bundle, by 27  September  2018,
    and a skeleton argument cross-referencing to that bundle no later  than
    7 days before the hearing. The appeal was to be relisted in  the  Upper
    Tribunal not before 10 October 2018.

21. The appellant was unable to comply with Judge Plimmer's directions.  On
    10 September 2018, Legal Rights Partnership wrote to  the  Tribunal  to
    say that they were no longer able to represent the appellant  on  legal
    aid as they had  withdrawn  from  the  legal  aid  contract,  but  were
    assisting the appellant in his adjournment application.  The  appellant
    did not have the money  to  pay  privately  but  would  make  strenuous
    efforts to find another legal aid solicitor, if time  was  allowed  for
    him to do so. They enclosed  a  statement  from  his  partner,  showing
    efforts made by her to contact legal aid solicitors on  17  July  2018,
    without success.

22. The appellant's partner in her statement said that he was  released  on
    licence in August 2018.  His sentence had allowed him to complete a lot
    of therapy and his mental health was noticeably  better,  according  to
    his partner, who has nothing but praise for the appellant's skills  and
    commitment as a father to  his  daughters.   He  takes  his  medication
    regularly, and goes to the gym which really  helps.   He  is  receiving
    support through MIND and on the waiting list for intensive  psychiatric
    counselling following his childhood trauma.  His daughters, who thought
    'daddy was away working' have been  delighted  to  have  him  home  and
    behavioural problems caused by his absence are  beginning  to  resolve.
    However, the appellant's partner also gave details of suicide  attempts
    by the appellant, one when he had taken all of his sleeping tablets and
    was referred to the mental health services, and another when he  walked
    in front of a car.

23. The adjournment was refused on 11 September 2018 and the  hearing  came
    before me as listed on  16  October  2018.  The  appellant  represented
    himself, with His partner assisting him  as  a  McKenzie  friend.   The
    appellant said that he was terrified at the prospect  of  dealing  with
    his appeal in person but did not apply for an adjournment as he had  no
    realistic hope of finding a legal aid solicitor  to  assist  him.   The
    appellant and his partner gave oral  evidence,  the  partner  remaining
    outside the hearing room while the appellant gave evidence.

Appellant's evidence

24. The appellant adopted his  prepared  statement,  which  stands  as  his
    evidence-in-chief.    In that statement, he  said  he  arrived  in  the
    United Kingdom when he was 7, but did not know who  his  parents  were.
    He received indefinite leave to remain when he was 15. He was unable to
    obtain British citizenship as the Angolan Embassy could not verify  his
    identity and provide him  with  a  birth  certificate  to  use  in  his
    application.

25. The appellant has been in the United Kingdom  for  most  of  his  life,
    having been born in 1982 and arrived here in 1989.  He is 36  now.   He
    was abused by his guardian (the 'uncle') as a  child  and  was  removed
    into the care of Tower Hamlets Social Services.   His  social  services
    files say he is Angolan, but he does not remember that.  He  no  longer
    speaks the language.

26. In 2007, the Secretary of State made a deportation order.  In 2008,  he
    was released on bail due to  the  inability  or  unwillingness  of  the
    Angolan authorities to provide him with a  travel  document:  his  bail
    conditions  included  residence  and   reporting   restrictions.    The
    appellant was not permitted to seek employment, claim benefits,  engage
    in studies or gain unpaid work.   He  had  to  sign  in  weekly  at  an
    immigration centre in Solihull.  He had no money to  make  the  80-mile
    round trip to Solihull every week but managed to comply, and to survive
    without income, with the help  of  his  partner  and  her  mother.  The
    appellant appealed against the deportation order.

27. The appellant began to have mental health and physical problems, losing
    weight, suffering anxiety and sleep problems. In 2009, he  visited  his
    general  medical  practitioner  and  was   given   tablets   and   some
    counselling. In 2011, the appellant was diagnosed  with  post-traumatic
    stress disorder following his childhood physical abuse and neglect. The
    counselling sessions later terminated, because  he  was  not  receiving
    benefits and ceased to qualify for them.

28. In 2013, the appellant and his partner had a baby daughter, who is  now
    5 years old.  The appellant looked after her while his partner  worked.



29. In 2014, the appellant won his appeal in the First-tier Tribunal, after
    a lengthy battle, but the respondent  appealed  out  of  time  and  the
    appellant attempted suicide. The  appeal  succeeded  again  before  the
    Upper Tribunal at the end of 2014, but the respondent appealed  to  the
    Court of Appeal.

30. The pregnancy and birth of his second child  kept  the  appellant  from
    further suicide attempts but he could not  come  to  terms  with  being
    unable to work and contribute financially to the household in which his
    partner and his young children lived.  He was starting to  wonder  what
    kind of a future he could give his children, if he  could  not  provide
    for them.   He wanted to be able to take his children on  holiday,  and
    more importantly, to give them the future he never had  himself.    The
    peer group with whom he had grown up were moving on with  their  lives.
    He felt British and it was a very  raw  wound  that  he  could  not  be
    naturalised.

31. The appellant has never been able to find lawful employment, no  matter
    how hard he  tried,  because  he  has  no  identity  documents  at  all
    (passport, birth certificate  or  identity  card).   In  fact,  without
    genuine photographic identity, the appellant claimed that he could  not
    even go into a public house (although, given the context of his  latest
    offence, it does appear that he manages to do so).

32. The Court of Appeal did not list the appeal for 18 months, during which
    time the appellant's state of mind deteriorated.  He felt  useless  and
    afraid, worrying because he still could not provide a good  quality  of
    life and a future for his children.  He was not  eating  properly,  and
    locked himself  away  at  home  for  6  months.   The  Angolan  Embassy
    continued to say that they would not issue him with travel documents as
    there was no evidence he was Angolan. The appellant felt  that  he  was
    not welcome there or anywhere.

33. His partner was trying to encourage him to do things, and  occasionally
    he did; she would give him pocket money, but when she was on  maternity
    leave, he felt he had to refuse it.  They received an  eviction  notice
    because there was a delay in increasing their housing benefit due to  a
    reduction  in  the  appellant's  partner's  income  while  she  was  on
    maternity leave.

34. Towards the end of  2015,  the  appellant  was  drinking  heavily.   In
    November 2015, the appellant went out for drinks with some people.   He
    had been offered cash in hand work by them, which he took, as it  would
    give him some money for Christmas.  After he had done the work, the man
    put off  paying  him.  The  appellant  was  feeling  really  angry  and
    frustrated.

35. At the public house, the appellant's employer pulled out a wallet which
    had 'wads of cash' in it and the appellant felt that was  very  unfair.
    Other people could behave badly but he had no way out of his situation.
     He felt 'fit to burst' and as if  the  pressure  of  the  Home  Office
    proceedings would never go away.

36. The appellant and his employer went on  from  the  public  house  to  a
    betting shop where the man began putting  a  lot  of  money  into  cash
    betting machines.  The appellant 'lost it'  and  started  fighting  the
    man, then jumped over the counter and stole money from the betting shop
    till.  He understood that the person would have been frightened by  his
    behaviour, though he did not use any violence.  The  appellant  regrets
    that behaviour.  He considers he was an idiot and that 'only  a  mental
    person would act in such manner'.  He had stayed out of trouble,  after
    his very serious offence in  2002,  for  15  years.   He  says  it  was
    entirely out of character and he could not believe what  he  had  done.
    He was arrested, and bailed pending trial till April 2017.

37. Towards the end of 2016, when the family's financial  difficulties  hit
    hardest, and while he was still on bail for his criminal  offence,  the
    appellant began drinking again and his partner  caught  him  trying  to
    take all the Prozac pills he had been prescribed.  He was  referred  to
    the mental health team and sectioned under  section  2  of  the  Mental
    Health Act 2918 for 3 weeks.   He  felt  'utterly  helpless,  hopeless,
    stressed and useless'.

38. The appellant says he is not a bad person and  has  never  intended  to
    hurt anyone.  He has no family except his partner and  their  children.
    He is taking steps to deal with his post-traumatic stress disorder  and
    on a waiting list for a psychologist.  He has  made  mistakes,  but  he
    asks for another chance and for forgiveness, which 'would  also  enable
    me to look at my past and turn all the negatives into positives which I
    know that with the support of my family and the mental  health  team  I
    can do'.

39. The appellant  was  then  cross-examined.   In  answer  to  Mr  Avery's
    questions, the appellant said he had no memory at all of  his  life  in
    Angola, if indeed that was where he lived before coming to  the  United
    Kingdom.  He could not remember any family links there,  nor  with  the
    'uncle' who brought him to the United Kingdom.  He thought the  'uncle'
    was just a person he travelled with.  The appellant could not  remember
    who the 'uncle'  was,  nor  what  his  role  was  in  relation  to  the
    appellant: he just knew he had to travel with this adult.  The  'uncle'
    had never told the appellant  anything  about  his  birth  family.  The
    'uncle' had not only abused the appellant himself, he had lent  him  to
    other family members who wanted to commit benefit fraud, so  that  they
    could claim for an extra child in the family.   The appellant had  been
    taken into care and his 'uncle' was deported, but he did  not  know  to
    which country his 'uncle' was removed.

40. The appellant's evidence  about  his  nationality  was  confusing,  and
    discrepant with statements he made earlier  that  he  lived  in  Angola
    before coming to the United Kingdom, and that his parents died when  he
    was very young.  Before me, the appellant said that he  did  not  think
    that he was an Angolan citizen; he had visited the Angolan Embassy  but
    without a birth certificate or any real memory of his early life,  they
    had been unable to confirm his citizenship.

41. The appellant said he had no idea where  he  might  be  from.   At  one
    point, the respondent had considered that he was likely to be a citizen
    of the Congo, but that had been retracted, and the appellant was  sure,
    at least, that he was not Congolese.  The suggestion had not come  from
    him. Documents on which he had travelled showed that he and the 'uncle'
    had flown to the United Kingdom from Zimbabwe, but  the  appellant  did
    not consider that this proved that he was from there.  He did not  know
    what language was spoken in Angola and  had  no  contact  with  anybody
    there since coming to the United Kingdom. The appellant  said  that  he
    was still confused as to where he was from, but that as you got  older,
    certain things became more clear to you; he had been trying  to  get  a
    document from the Angolan Embassy to have a sense of belonging.

42. Mr Avery put to the appellant the account of his history in his  latest
    psychiatric report, which was that his mother had died when he  was  an
    infant and he had been exposed to war as a child.  The  appellant  said
    he did not know why the doctor had recorded that as his history, as  he
    had not said it.  At least, he did not remember saying that,  but  when
    he saw the doctor, he was in a very low mood, stressed and anxious.  He
    was in a confused state of mind regarding where he came  from  when  he
    saw her.

43. The appellant said that he had no direct contact with his birth  family
    since coming to the United Kingdom, but  when  asked,  he  always  told
    people that his mother and father were dead, as a way of explaining why
    he had no direct family.  A lot of the information about where he  came
    from was not concrete, such as whether he had any parents elsewhere, or
    even the country he was supposed to come from.   There  was  a  lot  of
    confusion.  He understood that he was required to tell the truth to the
    Tribunal, but he said that he had never told the doctor that  he  lived
    with his mother in Angola or that she had died.

44. In relation to his mental  health,  the  appellant  said  he  had  been
    prescribed fluoxetine  (Prozac)  in  2009.   Fluoxetine  was  an  anti-
    anxiolytic medication which he understood was a treatment for  anxiety,
    depression, and calming moods.  He takes 40mg a day.  He also said that
    he was attending counselling sessions twice a week  at  Borough  North,
    and attends SMART and MIND.  All of  that  was  recent  and  there  was
    nothing in the bundle to support this part of his evidence.

45. The appellant had  finally  been  given  permission  to  work  and  was
    training with the Probation  Service  to  get  a  Constructions  Skills
    Certification Scheme (CSCS) card again, which he would have in the next
    week or two, after which he would be qualified to work  on  a  building
    site.  He would  shortly  be  having  a  practice  test  and  then  the
    Probation Service would book him a real one. He was also  renewing  his
    forklift truck driving  qualification.   He  had  obtained  both  these
    qualifications and numerous others in the  past,  but  they  are  time-
    limited and he was unable to use them before they expired,  because  he
    was not allowed to work.

46. The appellant's partner was also working, in a part time job for  MIND,
    working with drug addicts and so on,  in  Oxford.   He  said  that  she
    worked from 8 am - 5 pm, three days a week, but occasionally she  might
    work an extra day.  In the past,  before  he  was  imprisoned  for  his
    latest offence, the appellant had helped his partner by picking up  the
    children from school and looking after them.  If  his  partner  was  at
    work, he was the sole carer then, and he would give them their meals.

47. The younger child (now just 3 years old) went to nursery,  one  or  two
    days a week, but child care was not cheap.   The  older  child,  now  5
    years old, had been going to [~] primary school for one or  two  years.
    Because of his latest offence, the appellant had not  been  there  when
    they celebrated their birthdays; he sent cards  and  letters,  and  the
    children just thought he was working away from home.   Today,  as  both
    parents were at the hearing, his partner's mother had dropped them  off
    at school and nursery and would collect them, at least he thought  that
    was the arrangement.  His mother-in-law had a car, so  the  arrangement
    was convenient.  The appellant asked why  details  about  his  children
    were important:  was  Mr  Avery  suggesting  that  they  were  not  his
    children?  He loved his children dearly and coming from  his  difficult
    background, he considered them his biggest achievement.

Evidence of appellant's partner

48. The appellant's partner had waited outside during  his  evidence.   She
    adopted her statement of 9 September 2018 and asked that it be  treated
    as her evidence-in-chief. In that statement, she said that she had been
    in a relationship with the appellant for 12 years  (since  2006).   She
    gave details of attempts to contact legal aid solicitors  to  represent
    him at the hearing, which  reflect  the  parlous  state  of  legal  aid
    provision in the immigration sector.  I accept that the partner and the
    appellant have done everything they can to seek representation but that
    there is no firm willing to take him on.

49. The partner asserts that she  knows  the  appellant  is  no  danger  to
    anyone.  If he is allowed to work, he will  be  transformed.   When  he
    left custody  in  October  2008  following  his  10-year  sentence  for
    aggravated burglary in 2002, the appellant went to  live  with  her  in
    Oxford.  She has supported him for 10 years now, as he was released  on
    immigration bail with a restriction  order  which  prevented  him  from
    working, claiming benefits or accessing education.  He was required  to
    travel to Hounslow every week, a 100-mile round trip, to report  at  an
    immigration centre.

50. The partner was working and they had a very young baby, so she was  not
    able to support the appellant emotionally as much  as  she  would  have
    liked.  She also began to suffer depression and  anxiety  and  received
    treatment from  their  general  medical  practitioner.   The  appellant
    helped with childcare for the baby, as did his  partner's  mother:  she
    looked after the child when the appellant worked, or if the appellant's
    mental health meant he was not capable of taking care of the child.  He
    attempted suicide twice, once by taking all of his  Prozac  pills,  and
    once, after they heard about the appeal to  the  Court  of  Appeal,  by
    walking in front of a car.

51. Following the birth of their second child, the  partner  describes  the
    financial difficulties which she had  on  maternity  leave.   Sometimes
    they had to rely on  her  mother  for  food.   She  did  not  tell  the
    appellant what was happening until the landlord delivered a  notice  of
    eviction proceedings. The appellant was devastated, not  just  by  that
    news but because  she  had  not  shared  her  financial  and  emotional
    struggles with him. Communication had broken down between  the  couple,
    due to the strains on their relationship and the mental health problems
    each of them faced.

52. At this time, the appellant had anxiety, depression and  post-traumatic
    stress disorder, but was not taking his medication.   His  partner  had
    post-natal depression.  They were both desperate: it  was  during  this
    period that the appellant committed the second  offence.   His  partner
    was very angry and devastated, but in retrospect, she  thought  he  had
    done 'the only thing he knew how to do to survive'.  There was a  third
    suicide attempt in 2015 when the appellant left home at 10  pm  in  his
    pyjamas and was later found by  police  walking  towards  the  motorway
    bridge a few miles from home.  The police persuaded him to get in their
    car and took him off for psychiatric assessment.

53. The appellant's partner recognises that he has done wrong in his  life:
    she does not condone committing an offence,  under  any  circumstances.
    However, she says that he is not a bad person, and that  he  loves  his
    daughters dearly and is desperate to work and provide for them.

54. The appellant's mental health since returning home in August 2018 (just
    2 months before the hearing) seems better as he had access to a lot  of
    therapy during the sentence. The appellant  has  been  re-referred  for
    intensive psychological counselling but is likely to have to  wait  for
    up to 2 years.  In the meantime, he has signed up for some courses with
    MIND which will help him while he waits.

55. In everyday life, the appellant manages situations better.  He is  more
    settled, taking his medication every day and going to  the  gym,  which
    really helps.  She hopes that the matter will not drag on  for  another
    decade, as it affects not just the appellant but all  of  them  as  his
    family. The partner's statement concluded:

         "When my daughters were reconciled with their daddy, they  were  so
         happy, although they are still young and  thought  that  daddy  was
         working away for a while. Our youngest daughter, in particular, has
         been  much  happier  since  her  daddy  returned  home,  and   this
         difference has also been passed on by her nursery teachers  in  the
         last month.

         It would break their hearts if he were to be taken away from  them.
         He is an integral part of our family, we have  been  on  a  massive
         journey together and I honestly don't know what I would do  without
         him.  [The appellant] is an amazing man with so much  to  offer  in
         this life if only he would be given  the  opportunity  to  flourish
         without any restrictions. "

56. The partner was then tendered for cross-examination and was asked about
    the appellant's early life.  She said that he  did  not  remember  very
    much, but that she considered the fact of  his  mother's  death  to  be
    significant.  The appellant had always told her  that  he  was  in  the
    United Kingdom because his mother had died, and  he  had  spoken  about
    being in very hostile situations and hearing guns fired.  The appellant
    found it very difficult to speak about his childhood, as  it  triggered
    his post-traumatic stress disorder, but he had spoken to their  general
    medical practitioner and to Professor Katona about it.

57. After his mother's death, the appellant had been brought to the  United
    Kingdom by the 'uncle' who neglected and abused him, following which he
    grew up mainly in the care of Tower Hamlets Social Services.  There was
    a suggestion that the 'uncle' was a  relative  of  some  kind  but  the
    appellant had told her that he was not sure about that; he had  been  a
    young boy when brought to the United Kingdom.  Her own  experience  was
    that memories of family before the age of 8 were sketchy.  His  partner
    was certain the appellant had not contacted anyone in Angola since  she
    had known him. He did not have many friends or social contacts. She had
    been introduced to four people he knew, none  of  whom  were  Angolans.
    They included a friend, Judy, who had  been  a  great  support  to  the
    appellant and his partner.

58. Regarding the appellant's mental health, his partner confirmed that  he
    takes Prozac and sometimes a short course of diazepam.  Through the GP,
    the appellant attended Talking Space  Plus  and  Turning  Point  (which
    helps with substance abuse, a problem he had in the past).  He was on a
    2-year waiting list for counselling, which had been interrupted by  his
    latest sentence.  He was seeing his GP for some support but as  far  as
    counselling is concerned, he was not receiving any and  it  was  all  a
    question of waiting lists at present.

59. The appellant was not currently working, although he  wanted  to.   The
    appellant would remain on licence and under probation supervision until
    2020, the current conditions being that  he  report  to  the  Probation
    Officer, attend Turning Point and access support for his mental health.
    The appellant was actively looking for work and renewing his CSCS  Card
    and forklift licence.  Finding appropriate work was  difficult  as  the
    appellant  was  still  on  an  electronic  curfew  and  had   reporting
    requirements, which were quite expensive to meet as he had to travel to
    Solihull twice a week to sign in.  His partner felt that the  appellant
    was in a 'no win' situation.  The  appellant  had  asked  to  vary  the
    tagging requirements to give him more chance of  working  but  so  far,
    that had not been granted.

60. Two people had said they would employ him  once  he  had  his  forklift
    licence and CSCS card.  Construction work was a better option  for  the
    appellant, but the difficulty was the early morning starts, as  he  was
    not allowed to leave the house before 8 am under the electronic  curfew
    order. The appellant had been offered shift work  but  could  not  take
    that either, for the same reason.  In order to  come  to  the  Tribunal
    hearing, they had left home early and the appellant  had  breached  his
    electronic curfew, but would have to  deal  with  the  consequences  on
    their return home.

61. The partner said that she was the main carer for the  children.   Until
    recently, she had worked for 21 hours across 3 days a week, from 8 am -
    5 pm, and on a Tuesday, from 9 am - 2 pm because of school hours.   She
    had recently increased her hours to 28 hours  a  week  across  4  days.
    While she was at work, the children went to nursery  two  afternoons  a
    week, but when the appellant was imprisoned again, she had to put  both
    of them  into  childcare.   The  elder  child  had  started  school  in
    September 2017 and his partner took her in  early,  for  the  breakfast
    club at school, so  that  she  could  get  to  work  herself.   It  was
    inconvenient but the only real option. She worked as a substance misuse
    practitioner.  Her father lived in London, near where the appellant and
    a friend of his used to go to college, which was how they had met.

62. Asked about the appellant's reoffending, his partner said that  it  had
    been an extremely stressful period for them as a couple,  with  massive
    financial and personal hardship caused by her maternity  leave,  a  new
    baby,  and  the  appellant's  suicide  attempt.  It  had  been   almost
    inevitable that something would happen: the appellant was still on  the
    waiting list for counselling and she had been focusing on the baby  and
    their financial difficulties.

63. The partner said that she had been experiencing postnatal depression at
    the time.  Everything that could happen in a woman's life  happened  at
    once. She had been surprised and disappointed that  the  appellant  had
    chosen to reoffend, her understanding was that he  had  just  exploded.
    She had found it difficult as she was not used to being on her own with
    the children, she was used to having him around.  Their relationship at
    present was fine and she was enjoying having the appellant  back  home,
    despite the difficulties with his electronic curfew order.

Report of Dr Joanne Lackenby

64. Dr Lackenby is a chartered and registered forensic  psychologist.   Her
    report builds on a previous report, which would have  been  before  the
    Court of Appeal and the previous Tribunals.  She recorded  her  opinion
    in November 2013 that if  the  appellant's  appeal  were  unsuccessful,
    there was a significant risk of suicide and professional support  might
    be required when he was served with travel  documents.   The  appellant
    had expressed no current suicidal ideation but Dr  Lackenby  considered
    that his suicide risk would increase to very high, if  he  were  served
    with travel documents now.

65. Dr Lackenby had access to all the relevant documents and  reports,  and
    has been  involved  in  this  case  throughout.   She  interviewed  the
    appellant on  27  September  2018  at  his  home,  for  3  hours.   The
    appellant's partner was present some of the time, as  was  one  of  his
    young daughters.  Dr Lackenby had a discussion with the partner without
    the appellant for about half an hour, as well as with him.  The  report
    uses the HCR-20 violence risk assessment and the Structured  Assessment
    of Risk Factors.

66. The appellant told Dr Lackenby that he had relapsed  to  using  alcohol
    and drugs  while  in  prison.   He  remained  very  angry  against  the
    immigration system for the length of  time  the  proceedings  had  been
    going on, and the respondent being permitted to appeal out of time.

67. Dr Lackenby categorised certain factors as present and relevant  and/or
    absent and not relevant.  The  following  matters  in  the  appellant's
    history were treated as present and highly relevant  as  predictive  of
    future violence:

      a)  Serious  problems  with  violence  (robbery   conviction   as   an
         adolescent, aggravated burglary age 20, robbery age 34  and  fights
         in prison);

      b) Antisocial behaviour, based on the appellant having carried weapons
         in  his  adolescence  and  having  convictions  for  possession  of
         weapons, coupled with his association with antisocial peers and the
         use of drugs;

      c) Lack of any employment history.  The appellant has never had a  job
         apart from some limited casual employment, for  which  he  was  not
         paid, triggering the final offence.

      d) Relationship problems with his carers and peers  in  childhood  and
         adolescence.  He has a long-term stable and protective relationship
         with  his  partner,  but  when  she  was  unable  to  support   him
         emotionally and financially during their financial problems and her
         maternity leave, he returned to violent crime.

      e) Substance abuse.  The appellant had begun using drugs  and  alcohol
         when he was 12 years old (1994).  He regularly used  crack  cocaine
         before the 2002 offence, which was a significant antecedent in that
         offence.  He relapsed again into using alcohol and crack cocaine in
         2015 before the latest offence, to 'numb the pain of his problems'.
          He did not use crack cocaine at home or return home when under the
         influence, and was  adamant  that  he  would  not  use  around  his
         children.  As a result, he spent large amounts of  time  away  from
         the family home,  without  explanation,  concealing  his  drug  and
         alcohol use  from  his  partner.   Drug  and  alcohol  testing  and
         monitoring were conditions of his licence, with which so far he had
         complied;

      f) The appellant's mental  health  problems,  although  there  was  no
         suggestion of a personality disorder.

      g) Traumatic experiences:

             "[The appellant] reported a clear history of problems  arising
             from trauma.  His mother died when he was very young.  He  was
             trafficked to the United Kingdom when he was 7, by a  man  who
             claimed to be his  uncle.   He  struggled  to  integrate  into
             United Kingdom culture due to his inability to  speak  English
             and his restrictive and abusive home  life.   [The  appellant]
             was beaten, sexually abused, and neglected.  He was taken into
             care  where  he  had  difficulty  settling  and   integrating.
             ...Given [that the appellant] arrived in the United Kingdom as
             an unsupported  minor  who  was  then  subject  to  abuse  and
             neglect, it is a tragic but unsurprising consequence  that  he
             displays post-traumatic stress  disorder  symptomatology.   He
             was on a waiting list for  treatment  when  he  committed  the
             further offence in 2017."

68. Problems with violent attitudes are described as partially present  and
    of moderate relevance, while problems  with  treatment  or  supervision
    response are partially present but of low  relevance  to  the  risk  of
    violence.  The doctor then draws a series of distinctions  between  the
    support to which the appellant has access in  the  United  Kingdom  and
    that which she surmises he would not have in Angola.  It is  not  clear
    what her knowledge is of conditions in Angola, beyond  the  appellant's
    own account. She considers that if he were returned  to  Angola,  there
    would be a very high risk of suicide, or of his re-entering the  United
    Kingdom unlawfully, and  that  he  would  cope  poorly  away  from  his
    partner.

69. Gaining employment and an end to the immigration proceedings would help
    the appellant become more stable.  His formative life experiences  were
    as  a  child  trafficked  to  the  United  Kingdom  and  let  down  and
    unsupported by Tower Hamlets Social Services during his childhood.

70. Based on that analysis, and her  Structured  Assessment  of  Protective
    Factors (SAPROF), Dr Lackenby concluded that although the appellant did
    offend again while in a relationship with his partner, he had a  strong
    motivation to desist from crime and was likely to do so as long as  his
    relationship remained stable, his accommodation was stable, there  were
    no changes to his living  circumstances  and  no  return  to  substance
    misuse.

71. Dr Lackenby's opinion was that further  offending  and  violence  would
    become  an  imminent  risk  following  a  negative  decision  in  these
    proceedings,  financial  hardship,  breakdown  of   his   relationship,
    deterioration in the appellant's mental health, lack of  support  or  a
    relapse into drug or alcohol abuse.

Other new evidence

72. The appellant undertook the RESOLVE programme in prison, and  completed
    it on 14 December 2017, albeit with outstanding objectives.  The report
    notes that the appellant's sentence is due to end on  3  October  2020,
    though he was due for release, and was  released,  on  3  August  2018.
    They record that the appellant's sentence was for robbery committed  at
    a time when he  was  using  crack  cocaine,  cannabis  and  alcohol  in
    quantity.  I note that the appellant only mentioned the alcohol in  his
    latest statement.

73. The minutes of the appellant's Post Programme Progress Review  for  the
    HM  Prison  and  Probation  Services  RESOLVE  programmes   (Attitudes,
    Thinking and Behaviour) are dated 1  March  2018.   The  post-programme
    objectives identified to be completed following  the  review  concerned
    emotional  management  (rumination  worksheet);  interpersonal   skills
    (assertive  communication   worksheet);   and   impulsivity   (managing
    criticism or provocation worksheet). The review was good overall,  with
    the appellant being encouraged to practise  his  new  skills  and  stay
    motivated.

74. A report from the Prison Fellowship in the Sycamore Tree post-programme
    report is dated 14 February 2018, recording that he has made 'excellent
    progress towards victim awareness and his ability to  make  changes  to
    positively influence his and others' future'.  The course  had  'opened
    [his] eyes to the ripple crime causes, not just  affecting  one  victim
    but engulfing the families of both the  victim  and  the  offender  and
    impacting the wider community'.  He was remorseful and intended to make
    better choices in future.

75. An OASys assessment dated 27 September 2018, less than a  month  before
    the hearing, found the appellant still to present a medium risk to  the
    public in the community, but a low risk to children, known  adults  and
    staff.  There were concerns about breach of trust, because the  robbery
    offence was committed whilst on  immigration  bail,  and  his  previous
    offence of robbery in 1999 was committed while he was on bail.

76. The appellant had four adjudications while in prison: in April 2017, he
    was argumentative with staff and turned over a table tennis  table;  in
    June 2017 he fought  with  another  prisoner;  in  November  he  tested
    positive for the drug Spice, which he said was passive smoking from his
    cell mate; in January 2018 he fought again with a  cell  mate;  and  in
    June 2018, just two months before his release on licence, the appellant
    refused to provide his fingerprints to HOME OFFICE.

77. The appellant was required to make contact with Oxford Social  Services
    on release as he had self-reported near-daily  crack  cocaine  use  and
    daily consumption of 8-10  cans  of  strong  beer,  when  last  in  the
    community. Oxford Social Services would need to assess the  suitability
    of his involvement with his children, and any previous involvement with
    them. The appellant had a significant history of previous  offences  as
    set out above.  Regarding the most recent offence, the report says that
    the appellant went to the betting shop with two  other  men,  left  the
    shop, then ran back in and jumped over the counter  shouting  'give  me
    the fucking money'.  The cashier left, and the appellant took  a  purse
    from a staff member's handbag on a  seat  behind  the  counter,  and  a
    quantity of cash from the tills, and ran out of the shop.  One  of  his
    friends had already left; the closed circuit television cameras  showed
    the appellant head-butting the other one on his way out  of  the  shop,
    then running away.  The victim was a 49-year old  female  betting  shop
    manager.  The appellant had debts to 'loan sharks', was owed  money  by
    one of the men he entered the shop with, and was drinking 8-10 cans  of
    strong lager a day and spending about �200 a  week  on  crack  cocaine,
    which he took nearly every day.

Submissions

78. As the appellant was acting for himself, I explained that  there  would
    be an opportunity for both parties to say what they  wanted  about  the
    case.  I would invite Mr Avery to speak first and  then  the  appellant
    could tell me what he wanted me to  bear  in  mind  when  deciding  the
    appeal.

79. For the respondent, Mr Avery relied on section 117C of the 2002 Act and
    accepted that Exceptions 1 and 2 were met.  He invited me to find  that
    the appellant's evidence of his connections to Angola was  inconsistent
    and that he was not a credible witness in this respect.   His  evidence
    about his current life with his partner, to whom he is  engaged  to  be
    married, and their children, should also be treated with caution  where
    it diverged from other evidence on the same matters.

80. There was one up to date psychiatric report, to which Mr Avery asked me
    to have regard.   It recorded that the appellant  had  previously  been
    'sectioned', that is to say, compulsorily hospitalised  for  assessment
    and/or treatment pursuant to section 2 of the Mental Health  Act  1983.
    The evidence as  to  whether  the  appellant  was  currently  receiving
    counselling was discrepant as between  himself  and  his  partner.  The
    report indicated that the appellant was at risk of suicide if removed.

81. His offending history was serious (see section 117C(2)).   The  medical
    evidence was not particularly impressive, with a good  deal  about  the
    risk to the appellant but a lack overall rigour in  assessment  of  the
    asserted suicide risk.  Mr Avery submitted that  the  report  lacked  a
    proper diagnostic  approach  and  was  based  on  the  appellant's  own
    assertion that he would indeed commit suicide if returned to Angola.

82. Mr Avery asked me to find that the appellant was indeed  a  citizen  of
    Angola, as the Court of Appeal had found, and that  until  the  present
    hearing he had given fairly consistent accounts  to  that  effect.  The
    Tribunal should have regard to the assessment  of  risk  in  the  OASys
    report also.  The test in section 117C(6) was not met, on these  facts,
    and the appeal should be dismissed.

83. I then came to the appellant's submissions.  I read  him  section  117C
    and explained how it works.  The  appellant  spoke  about  his  claimed
    statelessness.   He  confirmed  that  while  in  prison  he  had   four
    adjudications, but said that the RESOLVE course had worked for him.  He
    had been bullied  and  did  not  cope  well  with  sharing  space  with
    strangers, but he had been taking steps to improve his  mental  health,
    filling in a diary and so on.  The authorities liked a person  to  open
    up while in prison.  The conclusion to the report said he  had  made  a
    lot of progress.

84. The appellant said that throughout the difficulties he had  experienced
    in the United Kingdom, he had tried to  change  his  life.   There  had
    always been people tugging him to left and right in his life, which had
    a major impact.  He felt trapped  in  his  own  situation  and  thought
    processes; he needed to  take  control  of  his  life.   The  appellant
    recognised that he  had  done  bad  things,  due  to  not  having  good
    guidance.  His social life was non-existent, as he was always at  home.
    He found it demoralising to rely on his  partner  and  needed  to  feel
    free.  He did not feel as though he had ever  been  free.   The  United
    Kingdom was his country and he had always tried.

85. The appellant said his family was all he had.  His second  offence  had
    taken place in very tense times and he needed  the  opportunity  and  a
    second chance.  He had always lived with a tag and a restriction but he
    had a good family and a lovely home to support him here now.

86. The appellant's partner asked to speak  on  his  behalf.   I  permitted
    that.  She said that his mental health was the compelling  factor.   It
    made him difficult to live with  and  managing  his  attempts  to  kill
    himself was really hard.  Sending him  back  to  Angola  would  not  be
    right.  The reports showed only a small part of the difficulties he had
    experienced related to his mental health.

87. I reserved my decision which I now give.  I have had regard to all  the
    evidence set out above and also to the submissions of both parties.   I
    recognise that it was not easy for the appellant to  represent  himself
    before me and I have approached  my  decision  with  anxious  scrutiny,
    bearing in mind that the appellant did not have the  benefit  of  legal
    representation.

Analysis

88. The first question is to establish the factual matrix.   The  Court  of
    Appeal treated the appellant as a citizen of Angola  and  it  is  clear
    that until his written and oral evidence at the Upper Tribunal hearing,
    the appellant's case was that he had been orphaned very young in Angola
    and trafficked to the United Kingdom with his 'uncle', following  which
    there is no dispute about the abuse which  he  unfortunately  suffered,
    nor that in due course he obtained indefinite leave to remain.

89. I accept  the  appellant's  evidence,  which  is  corroborated  in  the
    respondent's  documents,  that  there  have  been   serious   practical
    difficulties  in  his  obtaining  a  travel  document,   or   a   birth
    certificate, from the Angolan Embassy.   If  the  appellant  is  to  be
    removed it will be for the respondent to seek to  obtain  an  emergency
    travel document from Angola, without which he  cannot  in  practice  be
    removed.  That does not affect whether it  is  lawful  for  him  to  be
    removed.

90. The appellant  has  made  no  formal  statelessness  claim,  and  until
    recently he seems to have accepted that he was  Angolan,  and  that  he
    came here because his mother, or his parents, were dead.  The partner's
    oral evidence reflects that account  and  she  considers  it  to  be  a
    significant element in the problems he has experienced.

91. His assertions now  in  his  oral  evidence  that  he  cannot  remember
    anything about his parents, including whether they are dead or not  and
    whether he came from Angola originally, are not credible  even  to  the
    low standard required in international protection claims.   I  continue
    to treat him as a citizen of Angola.

92. The appellant has a  long  criminal  history,  beginning  in  1997  and
    continuing through to the offence on 31 October 2015.   It appears that
    he has made efforts while in prison to rehabilitate himself but that is
    very much a work in progress at this stage.  The index  offence  was  a
    very nasty robbery, committed when he was 19 years old.   I  note  that
    the latest offence was committed under the influence  of  both  alcohol
    and drugs, and that the appellant had been using drugs and alcohol  and
    staying away from his family home  until  he  was  sober,  successfully
    concealing what was happening from his wife and his two young children.
     Despite his assertion that without documents  he  could  not  go  into
    public houses, he was doing so and indeed that was where he  got  drunk
    in October 2015 before the betting shop offence.

93. I further note that the appellant does not mention the drug use in  his
    witness statement,  nor  in  his  oral  evidence  today,  and  that  he
    continued to use both alcohol and drugs,  and  had  four  adjudications
    while in prison, including one in June 2018, just a few  months  before
    this hearing, where he refused to provide his fingerprints to the  Home
    Office, even though he was almost due  for  release  on  licence.   The
    appellant's evidence was that he did not cope well with  sharing  space
    with strangers.

94. It is clear that there is  a  strong  bond  of  affection  between  the
    appellant and his  partner,  who  has  supported  him  financially  and
    emotionally for 10 years now.  I accept that the appellant has a  good,
    loving relationship with his children, although he has missed  part  of
    their lives while  serving  his  latest  sentence.   The  children  are
    healthy and his  partner  is  their  primary  carer,  assisted  by  the
    appellant when he is home and his mental health permits, and  otherwise
    by her mother.  The appellant is not their primary carer.

95. The evidence of Dr Lackenby is designed to show whether  the  appellant
    continues to present a risk of  violence  outside  prison.   He  has  a
    serious past history of violence and antisocial behaviour.  He  has  no
    employment history, even before his prison sentence  at  19.   He  used
    crack cocaine before the  2002  offence,  and  again  before  the  2015
    offence, and his licence  from  prison  requires  him  to  continue  to
    address this and his mental health.  He has  no  personality  disorder.
    Dr Lackenby considered that the appellant had a  strong  motivation  to
    desist from crime.

96. However, further offending and violence would become an  imminent  risk
    if the appellant's relationship with his partner was  compromised,  his
    mental health deteriorated, he suffered financial problems or  lack  of
    emotional support, or a relapse into drug or alcohol abuse.

97. I place less weight on Dr  Lackenby's  opinions  regarding  what  would
    happen in Angola.  She does not assert  any  country  expertise  there.
    She also appears to descend into the arena when finding that an adverse
    decision by this Tribunal would drive the  appellant  back  to  further
    offending and violence.  Dr Lackenby's opinion  suggests,  I  consider,
    that the appellant remains very unstable and that unless his life  goes
    perfectly, he is likely to descend back into crime and violence.

98. The appellant has mental health problems.  He  is  assessed  as  having
    post-traumatic  stress  disorder  and  depression,  as  well   as   the
    consequences of his past heavy drinking and cocaine use.  There  is  no
    evidence before me about what the medical facilities in Angola may  be.
     Dr Lackenby's report simply presumes that the appellant  will  receive
    no or inadequate treatment and that his suicide risk will  increase  on
    return to Angola.

99. I consider, therefore, whether the appellant's case is made  out  under
    section 117C of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  (as
    amended), so far as relevant to this appeal:

         "117C Article  8:  additional  considerations  in  cases  involving
         foreign criminals

         (1)   The  deportation  of  foreign  criminals  is  in  the  public
         interest.

         (2)  The more serious the offence committed by a foreign  criminal,
         the greater is the public interest in deportation of the  criminal.
         ...

         (4)  Exception 1 applies where-

             (a)  C has been lawfully resident in the  United  Kingdom  for
             most of C's life,

             (b)  C is socially and culturally  integrated  in  the  United
             Kingdom, and

             (c)   there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to   C's
             integration into the country to which  C  is  proposed  to  be
             deported.

         (5)  Exception 2 applies where  C  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
         relationship with a qualifying partner, or a genuine and subsisting
         parental relationship with a qualifying child, and  the  effect  of
         C's deportation on the partner or child would be unduly harsh.

         (6)  In the case of a foreign criminal who has been sentenced to  a
         period of imprisonment of at least four years, the public  interest
         requires   deportation   unless   there   are    very    compelling
         circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions  1  and
         2. ..."

100. In this case, the appellant committed a very serious offence when  just
    19.  He was sentenced to 10 years in  a  Young  Offenders  Institution.
    The respondent accepts, for the  purpose  of  these  proceedings,  that
    Exceptions 1 and 2 could be met on the facts.   The  question  then  is
    whether there are in this case, very compelling circumstances over  and
    above those described in Exceptions 1 and 2.  I remind  myself  of  the
    appellant's oral submissions, that he needed to feel free,  finding  it
    demoralising to rely on his partner financially and emotionally, but  I
    note that he continues to blame external circumstances for his actions.



101. This is not a question, as the  appellant  asked  me  to  consider,  of
    giving him a second chance.  The appellant  has  had  many  chances  to
    improve his behaviour and even giving full weight to  his  attempts  to
    improve himself  during  his  last  sentence,  I  take  account  of  Dr
    Lackenby's evidence as to the fragility of his present abstention  from
    crime and violence.

102. The question for the Upper Tribunal  which  will  be  determinative  of
    this appeal is whether there are 'very compelling  circumstances'  over
    and above those described in Exceptions 1 and 2.  For this purpose, his
    strong relationships with his partner and children  do  not  come  into
    account, as they fall within the Exceptions.  The partner submits  that
    the appellant's mental health is such a circumstance.

103. I am guided by the opinion of Lord Carnwath JSC (with whom  agreed)  in
    KO (Nigeria) v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2018]  UKSC
    53:

         "20. Turning to section 117C the structure is not entirely easy  to
         follow. It starts with the general rules (1)  that  deportation  of
         foreign criminals is in the public interest, and (2) that the  more
         serious the offence the greater that interest. There is however  no
         express indication as to how or at what stage of the process  those
         general rules are to be given effect. Instead, the remainder of the
         section  enacts  specific  rules  for  two  categories  of  foreign
         criminals, defined by reference to whether or not  their  sentences
         were of four years or more, and two precisely  defined  exceptions.
         For those sentenced to less than four years,  the  public  interest
         requires deportation unless exception 1 or  2  applies.  For  those
         sentenced to four years or more, deportation  is  required  "unless
         there are very  compelling  circumstances,  over  and  above  those
         described in Exceptions 1 and 2".

         21.  The difficult question is whether the specific rules allow any
         further room for balancing  of  the  relative  seriousness  of  the
         offence, beyond the difference  between  the  two  categories.  The
         general rule stated in subsection (2) might lead one to expect some
         such provision, but it could equally be read  as  no  more  than  a
         preamble to the more specific rules. Exception 1 seems to leave  no
         room for further balancing. It is precisely defined by reference to
         three factual issues: lawful residence in the UK for  most  of  C's
         life, social and  cultural  integration  into  the  UK,  and  "very
         significant obstacles" to integration into the country of  proposed
         deportation. None of these turns on the seriousness of the offence;
         but, for a sentence of less than four years, they  are  enough,  if
         they are met, to remove the public  interest  in  deportation.  For
         sentences of four years or more, however, it is not enough to  fall
         within the exception, unless there are in addition "very compelling
         circumstances"."

104. The circumstances relied upon by this appellant  are  not  such  as  to
    amount to very compelling circumstances, if one subtracts the  question
    whether there are very significant obstacles to  his  reintegration  in
    Angola, and whether it would be unduly harsh for his  partner,  or  his
    children.  There is simply no reliable evidence before  me  about  what
    mental health provision is like in Angola and  no  other  circumstances
    which could bring him within the super-exception in section 117C(6).

105. Accordingly, I  remake  the  decision  by  dismissing  the  appellant's
    appeal.

DECISION

106. For the foregoing reasons, my decision is as follows:

    The making of the previous decision involved the making of an error  on
    a point of law.

    I set aside the previous decision.  I remake the decision by dismissing
    the appeal.
