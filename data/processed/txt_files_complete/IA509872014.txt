                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is another  of  those  cases  which  is  the  fall  out  from  the
    examination which has been taking place now over a number of  years  of
    the way by which ETS process English language  test  certificates.   In
    this case the judge, First-tier Tribunal Judge Grice whose decision was
    promulgated on 29 July 2015, allowed the  appeal.   She  did  so  as  a
    result of making a number of findings of fact.

 2. I shall refer to Mrs Basnet as the appellant  as  she  was  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

 3. The appellant first entered the United Kingdom on 23  July  2010  as  a
    spouse and was granted a visa valid until 23 October  2012.   She  then
    made an application for an extension and  the  respondent  required  an
    English language test certificate.  On appeal, she was granted leave to
    remain until 11 December 2015.

 4. On the strength of that grant of leave, she left the United Kingdom and
    returned from Belgium  on  21  December  2012  having  accompanied  her
    husband on a trip.  She was stopped at the border by the  Border  Force
    Agency at Heathrow and at that stage confronted with the fact that  the
    English  language   certificate   had   been   fraudulently   obtained.
    Directions were made to cancel her leave to remain and for her removal.
     It was that process which precipitated the appeal.

 5. The issue for the judge to consider was whether the Secretary of  State
    had properly established that the English language test certificate had
    been obtained by fraud.  The appellant herself denied that a proxy test
    taker had been used and she gave detailed evidence about  how  she  had
    set about obtaining the test.   She  got,  in  fact,  a  bargain  price
    because she both took the ESOL test and also the TOEIC test.  She  gave
    evidence that she was provided with a  discounted  price  of  ï¿½400  for
    that.  She described how she went to the test centre  in  Watford;  she
    described what happened in the test; how many people were attending the
    test at the same time.  She described how she did the listening  module
    first.  She then went on to say that she repeated the test at  a  later
    stage and she successfully passed it.  In addition to that  she  passed
    her Life in the United Kingdom test in February 2015.

 6. In adding  greater  detail,  she  and  her  witness  spoke  about  what
    happened; described the journey to the test centre; the route that  was
    taken and the walk that was necessary from the Docklands Light  Railway
    Station.

 7. There was therefore a great deal of circumstantial evidence  which  the
    judge listened to  and  evaluated.   Clearly  the  judge  accepted  the
    evidence that was provided by the appellant and her witness.

 8. She considered the evidence that was provided by the  Home  Office  and
    that included the evidence of Matthew Harold, a senior caseworker,  and
    the references that were made to Peter Millington's  witness  statement
    as well as the witness evidence statement of Rebecca Collings.

 9. She weighed up therefore the competing claims and took into account the
    classification that had been provided by ETS that this test  result  in
    the appellant's case was "invalid".  Having  heard  that  evidence  she
    also considered the evidence that the ETS  system  was  not  foolproof,
    that there were false positives and finally concluded that the evidence
    provided by the Home  Office  was  generic  in  character,  whilst  the
    evidence provided by the appellant was direct and  credible.   On  that
    basis she allowed the appellant's appeal.

10. The grounds of appeal assert that the judge should have  attached  more
    weight to the classification of  this  test  result  as  being  invalid
    because that was the description provided by ETS where the  same  voice
    had been detected on multiple  tests.   However,  one  cannot  entirely
    disregard the fact that the evidence of Peter  Millington  and  Rebecca
    Collings has subsequently been questioned and that  there  was  in  the
    public domain by the early part of 2015 evidence from Dr Harrison  that
    the system was flawed.  That was material which the judge did not  have
    before her but which would certainly have  supported  her  conclusions.
    It will inevitably feature were there  to  be  any  rehearing  of  this
    appeal, or indeed any requirement on the part of the Secretary of State
    to make a fresh decision.

11. I am satisfied that the decision that was made by the Immigration Judge
    was one that was properly open to her on the basis of the material that
    was provided to her.  Consequently I dismiss the Secretary  of  State's
    appeal against that decision.

12. I have to say that her decision has recently  been  vindicated  by  the
    question  marks  that  have  been  placed  about  the  evidence  of  Mr
    Millington and Ms Collings.  No material error of law is found.

DECISION

     The decision of the First-tier Tribunal discloses no error on  a  point
    of law and shall stand as the lawful disposal of the appeal.

     No anonymity direction is made.
