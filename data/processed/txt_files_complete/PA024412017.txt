                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal against the decision of First-tier Tribunal  Judge  N
    M  Paul  dismissing  the  Appellant's  asylum  appeal  in  a   decision
    promulgated on 25 April 2017.

2.   The Appellant is a citizen of Afghanistan whose personal details are  a
    matter of record on file.  He claims to  have  arrived  in  the  United
    Kingdom clandestinely on 10 June 2016.  On 14 June 2016 he underwent an
    Islamic marriage ceremony with Z, a refugee in the UK to  whom  he  had
    been engaged whilst living in Afghanistan.

3.   The basis of Z's grant  of  refugee  status  is  founded  in  the  same
    circumstances upon which the  Appellant  advances  his  own  claim  for
    protection.  This is summarised starting at paragraph 2 of the Decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal Judge herein.  It is said that the Appellant
    and Z, who was a cousin of his, had  become  engaged  at  a  relatively
    young age but that in February 2015 Z's parents were approached by  one
    S.  S was a senior military commander and a political  figure  of  some
    considerable influence acquainted with Afghani war lords.  He was  also
    the commander of the police within Mazar-e-Sharif.   S  approached  the
    parents of Z indicating that he  wished  to  marry  her.   The  parents
    refused  this  request  and  in  consequence  Z's  father  was  beaten.
    Arrangements were thereafter made for Z to move to Kabul, and later  on
    indeed she left Afghanistan and made her way  to  the  United  Kingdom.
    After Z's departure the Appellant returned to his family home where  he
    was later attacked by S resulting in him  being  hospitalised  for  two
    weeks.  He then in effect went into hiding and in due course also  left
    Afghanistan. It should perhaps be briefly observed at this  stage  that
    the Appellant's history also includes a period of time pre-dating these
    events where he was present in Europe travelling between Turkey, Greece
    and Italy but then returning to Afghanistan.

4.   Z departed Afghanistan in 2015.  Details of her case  are  set  out  in
    the decision of First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Callender  Smith,  (Ref.No.
    AA/12055/2015), promulgated on 1 February 2016.  It may  be  seen  from
    that decision at paragraph 4 that Z's case was based on her  fear  that
    she would be  forced  to  marry  S  who  would  then  abuse  her.   The
    background to Z's case is set out at paragraph 10 of  the  decision  of
    Judge Callender Smith and includes references to the Appellant  herein.
    In particular it is noted that at the time of the approach by S she was
    already engaged to the Appellant.  It is also indicated that  following
    the assault on her father the Appellant was instrumental  in  escorting
    her to Kabul.  In the context  of  Z's  case  the  Secretary  of  State
    acknowledged that women in Afghanistan could form a  particular  social
    group.  The decision of Judge Callender  Smith  notes  that  a  country
    expert report was prepared by Dr  Antonio  Giustozzi  dated  1  January
    2016:  the  report  provided  particular  information  about   S,   his
    background position and influence.  The same report was included in the
    Appellant's bundle before the First-tier Tribunal in the instant  case.



5.   The Judge in Z's case made the following findings at paragraphs  27  to
    30:

         "27. On the documentary and oral evidence that  I  have  heard  and
             considered in this appeal I find the Appellant's  account  (as
             has the Respondent) cogent and credible.


         28.  The issue is not whether threats were issued to  her  and  her
             family by [S] but whether she is someone  who  can  return  to
             Afghanistan and live safely if she relocated to somewhere like
             Herat.


         29.  I note that her father was hospitalised having been beaten  up
             by [S] with the butt of his  gun  and  that  her  fianc�  [the
             Appellant herein] was directly threatened by [S] and in effect
             warned off continuing any relationship with the  Appellant  or
             assisting her in any way.


         30.  Central to this appeal is the issue of the power and the reach
             of [S] as a Police Commander with powerful political friends."

6.   The Judge then sets out something of the evidence that was  before  him
    with particular reference to  the  country  expert's  report  and  then
    states the following conclusions at paragraphs 38 to 40:

         "38. It is of note that at paragraph 10 of the expert report it  is
             stated  that  [S]  is  married  with  two  wives  but  "has  a
             reputation for harassing young girls and for forcing them into
             forced  marriages.   His  position  in  the  police  and   the
             protection  he  enjoys  from   Atta   prevent   families   and
             individuals from bringing him to justice."


         39.   [S]  is  clearly  a  thoroughly  unpleasant   and   dangerous
             individual and there is every reason why this  Appellant  fled
             from his attentions to seek safety and asylum in this country.


         40.  The final paragraph of the expert report confirms my view.  It
             is stated that [S] is one of the closest  associates  of  Atta
             Mohammed Noor, one of the main powerbrokers in Afghanistan and
             the dominant personality in the North.   Despite  having  been
             involved in criminal activities and in abuses  against  women,
             he  has  never  been  prosecuted  thanks  to   the   political
             protection he enjoys."


    On that basis the Judge concluded that Z was a refugee  as  defined  by
    Article 1A(2) of the 1951 Refugee Convention.


7.   The Judge additionally observed as follows at paragraphs 43 to 48:

         "43. I have found that [S] is someone  of  considerable  influence.
             He 'casts a long shadow' and - given his attacks on  both  the
             Appellant's father and fianc� -  is  unlikely  to  change  his
             attitudes or approaches in the future.


         44.  This leave the Appellant at significant risk if she returns to
             Afghanistan and makes the prospect of any kind  of  relocation
             unsafe for her because of the long reach  [S]  would  have  to
             find out where she might be.


         45.  He is someone who could use all the  intelligence  sources  of
             the state to find out about her whereabouts and to  cause  her
             further distress and potentially direct harm.


         46.  There is insufficient protection available to this  particular
             Appellant on return to Afghanistan.  The very person she fears
             on return is part of the state that she would need to turn  to
             for protection and, from the evidence I have seen, he  is  the
             person who would prevail  rather  than  anyone  else  in  this
             situation.


         47.  I note from the  Respondent's  2015  OGN  on  Afghanistan  (at
             3.2.9/3.2.10) that women with a male support  network  may  be
             able to relocate internally but  that  women  cannot  rely  on
             protection  from  the  Afghan  authorities  and  it  would  be
             unreasonable  to  expect  lone  women  and  female  heads   of
             household to relocate internally.


         48.  In the unusual circumstances of this appeal, the Appellant  is
             a lone woman.  Her father has been  unable  to  give  her  any
             protection - and  has  landed  up  in  hospital  as  a  result
             resisting [S] - and her fianc� is unlikely to wish to take  on
             the baleful power and influence of [S]."

8.   I pause to make  a  brief  observation  in  respect  of  paragraph  48.
    Although it is clear that the Judge in Z's case  ultimately  found  the
    Convention reason to be membership of a particular social  group  being
    'lone women', it is to be noted that with regard to the  assaults  that
    had taken place on Z's father and fianc�, such assaults were indicative
    of the fact that even if in the company of male  relatives  she  -  and
    they - were not safe from the attentions of S.

9.   The Appellant herein advances his claim against the background set  out
    in Z's case - although he gave some detail as to the circumstances  and
    events that befell him after Z had been  taken  to  Kabul  and  he  had
    returned to his family home.  This may be seen n his witness  statement
    dated 25 January 2017: see in particular at paragraphs 12, 17  and  18.
    At paragraph 12 he refers to his return to his home and being beaten by
    S with his men and warned that if they found that it was him  that  had
    helped Z to escape from Mazar-e-Sharif or Afghanistan they  would  kill
    him.  He describes thereafter going into places of hiding and  then  at
    paragraph 17 states that during that period S's men went  to  his  home
    looking for him and similarly, at paragraph 18, that there was  a  raid
    on his house and documents were sought with a view to  implicating  him
    in some criminal behaviour.

10.  The Respondent refused the Appellant's application for  protection  for
    reasons set out in the 'reasons for refusal' letter  ('RFRL')  dated  9
    February 2017.  At paragraphs 19 and 20  of  the  RFRL  the  Respondent
    asserted  that  the  Appellant's  claim  did  not  engage  the  Refugee
    Convention because there was an absence of Convention  reason  for  his
    feared persecution or feared harm.   This is repeated at paragraphs  46
    and 47 of the RFRL.

11.  So far  as  the  facts  were  concerned  the  Respondent  observes  the
    following at paragraph 24:

         "It is accepted, to the lower threshold and with the assistance  of
         the appeal determination of Immigration Judge Callender Smith dated
         01-02-2016 that [S] wanted to marry [Z]."

     Thereafter the Respondent makes reference to section 8  of  the  Asylum
    and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004 and  associated
    case law, before observing that the Appellant had not claimed asylum en
    route to the UK and indeed had  not  claimed  asylum  immediately  upon
    arrival.

12.  At paragraph 28 of the RFRL the Respondent restates that the  facts  as
    set out at paragraph 24 (quoted above) were accepted.  Nothing  further
    of substance is said about the facts underlying the  Appellant's  claim
    save that in respect of his subjective fear it is said at paragraph  30
    that "in light of the above conclusions it is  not  accepted  that  you
    have a genuine subjective fear on return to Afghanistan".

13.  The "above conclusions" in context can only mean the  adverse  'section
    8' consideration.  It is difficult to see in  circumstances  where  the
    Respondent accepted the essential  truth  of  Z's  case,  accepted  the
    relationship between Z and the Appellant, and where the  Appellant  had
    indicated that in addition to fleeing Afghanistan he was motivated by a
    wish to be with his fianc�e, that the failure to claim asylum en  route
    to the UK, or indeed to claim asylum until after he was married,  could
    have weighed so significantly heavy in  the  overall  balance  that  it
    destroyed any other aspects of the credibility of his claim.

14.  Be that as it may, the remainder of the RFRL  essentially  goes  on  to
    reject the Appellant's claim to have a well-founded fear of persecution
    by reference to sufficiency of  protection  or  alternatively  internal
    relocation.

15.  Nothing in the passages set out by the Respondent  under  the  headings
    of 'sufficiency  of  protection'  or  'internal  relocation'  expressly
    engages with the findings and reasonings of Judge  Callender  Smith  in
    respect of the hopelessness for Z of approaching  the  authorities  for
    protection, or the difficulties that she might experience in seeking to
    relocate.  Whilst necessarily Judge Callender Smith's findings were  in
    the context of Z's case, it is difficult to see how, provided with such
    findings, and in the light of the acceptance of some such  findings  at
    paragraph 24 of the  RFRL,  the  decision-maker  did  not  consider  it
    necessary or appropriate to descend to some sort of  consideration  and
    analysis so that the Appellant might have better understood  why  those
    favourable findings in Z's appeal were not considered to  be  of  great
    assistance to him in his own claim.

16.  Nonetheless, the  Respondent  accepted  the  fact  of  the  Appellant's
    relationship with Z, noted that Z was due to give birth to their  child
    in March 2017, (Z and the Appellant are indeed now  the  parents  of  a
    child), and at paragraph 54 indicated that in  such  circumstances  the
    Appellant would be granted discretionary leave to remain  by  reference
    to Article 8.  The covering  page  of  the  RFRL  identifies  that  the
    Appellant was granted 30 months' leave to remain to expire on 9  August
    2019.  I pause to note that this was not leave directly 'in line'  with
    the leave granted to his partner.

17.   Notwithstanding  the  grant  of  discretionary  leave  to  remain  the
    Appellant appealed against the refusal of protection to the IAC.

18.  The appeal was dismissed for reasons set out in the decision of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Paul promulgated on 25 April 2017.

19.  I do not propose to recite at length the Decision of  Judge  Paul  (see
    further below) but do make the  following  observation  in  respect  of
    paragraph 6.  It is apparent  that  the  Appellant  was  asked  by  the
    Respondent's representative to consider the  apparent  absence  of  any
    harm to family members.  The Judge records the following:

         "He then confirmed to [the Presenting Officer] that no  other  harm
         had come to her family since her departure, and that as far  as  he
         was aware  no  further  threats  had  been  made  to  either  their
         respective families since  he  had  been  in  the  United  Kingdom.
         However, he added that it would be a matter  of  'honour'  if  they
         were to come after them if they returned to Afghanistan."


20.  Much of the Judge's determination is a  recitation  of  the  background
    facts and the respective submissions: it is not until paragraphs 16 and
    17 that anything appears by way of specific reasoning on the  facts  of
    the particular case.  Indeed there is nothing beyond paragraphs 16  and
    17 that might be characterised as constituting reasoning with regard to
    the outcome of the appeal.  In those circumstances it is appropriate to
    quote those paragraphs in full:

         "16.  This  case  is  concerned  with  whether  the  appellant  can
             establish that he is a victim of persecution.  In my view,  he
             cannot.  He has not established that he is  a  member  of  any
             particular social group and is not able to rely  on  the  fact
             that, simply because he is married  to  his  spouse,  that  he
             becomes (by osmosis) entitled to protection on the basis  that
             she had been granted protections which, in any event, was only
             extended to her on the basis that she was a lone  woman.   The
             appellant's own history is an interesting one because, on  his
             own account, he had previously left Afghanistan and had  spent
             time in Europe before deciding to return to  Afghanistan.   He
             had a background working  for  an  oil  company  and,  in  his
             witness statement, alludes to the fact  that  there  had  been
             previous problems based on allegations of corruption which had
             caused  him  to  flee.   In  my  view,  the  appellant  is   a
             resourceful and experienced man and does not (in my view) fall
             to be treated as being linked to his wife in the same way that
             perhaps might be the case if he was  a  woman  in  traditional
             culture dependent upon the safety and sanctity provided  by  a
             husband.


         17.  This is not in any way to undermine the findings made  by  the
             previous decision in respect of his wife.  But it does involve
             considering the fact that there  has  been  no  continuing  of
             threats in relation to his or  his  wife's  family,  and  that
             whatever the position might have been in 2015,  it  is  highly
             unlikely that there would be  any  long-term  consequences  at
             this stage.  In any event, those findings were not germane  to
             the critical question as to whether  or  not  he  is  able  to
             establish on the facts that he has relied on that he qualifies
             for refugee protection."

21.  The Judge then concludes the decision by stating  that  the  appeal  is
    dismissed "on refugee grounds and humanitarian grounds".

22.  It may be seen from  paragraphs  16  and  17  whilst  there  is  direct
    consideration  of  Refugee  Convention  reasons,  there  is  no   finer
    consideration of issues of ECHR Articles  2  and  3  or  otherwise  the
    principles of humanitarian protection.

23.  The Appellant applied for permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal
    which was granted on 24 May 2017 by First-tier Tribunal Judge Cruthers.
     Judge Cruthers considered that it was  arguable  that  the  Judge  had
    taken in isolation a single paragraph from the decision in  Z's  appeal
    in respect of protection as a lone woman and had accordingly not  given
    full weight and consideration to the import of that decision.   It  was
    also considered  arguable  that  the  Judge  had  not  made  sufficient
    findings on the core asylum account of the Appellant.

24.  As I have indicated above, it is paragraphs 16 and 17 that contain  the
    entirety of the material reasoning in the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  Nothing else in the decision  is  present  by  way  of  case
    specific reasons.  With all due  respect  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge, even the well-informed reader has to work very hard to take much
    by way of understanding from these paragraphs.   In  my  judgment  they
    lack clarity.  There is no very obvious finding present in  respect  of
    the Appellant's history.  There is no very clear  engagement  with  the
    Convention reason issue as recorded at paragraph 12 of the decision  as
    having been argued on behalf of the  Appellant  by  his  representative
    with regard in particular to the case of K & Fornah [2006] UKHL 46.   I
    have already noted that there is no particular  alternative  engagement
    with issues in relation to the ECHR and humanitarian  protection.   The
    second half of paragraph 16 is not obviously  relevant  to  the  issues
    that were germane to the appeal - notwithstanding that  they  were,  in
    the Judge's inconclusive observation, "interesting".

25.  What sense might then be made of these passages?

26.  In the first instance it seems to me that the first half  of  paragraph
    16 and the final sentence in paragraph 17 appear to be  addressing  the
    issue of Convention reason.  I have  already  noted  that  it  was  the
    Respondent's case in the RFRL  that  the  Appellant's  appeal  did  not
    engage  the  Refugee   Convention.    In   contrast   the   Appellant's
    representative argued that it did by reference  to  the  case  of  K  &
    Fornah.  In my judgment the opening  half  of  paragraph  16  does  not
    engage adequately with those submissions and arguments  in  respect  of
    each of the parties to the appeal.  However if  the  appeal  rested  on
    this point alone I would likely not be minded  to  interfere  with  the
    decision in the appeal.  In  my  judgment,  albeit  that  there  is  an
    absence of clear reasoning,  the  Judge  has  reached  the  appropriate
    conclusion  in  respect  of  Refugee  Convention  reason.   I   invited
    submissions today in this regard and there is nothing pursuant to those
    submissions that persuades me that this is  a  case  that  engages  the
    Refugee Convention.

27.  It seems to me that the real  difficulty  for  the  Appellant  in  this
    regard is that he was not targeted whilst in Afghanistan  as  a  family
    member per se, but was targeted either or both because he  was  a  love
    rival of S, and S suspected him of assisting Z  to  escape  him.   This
    indeed is underscored by the fact that the risk that had eventuated  to
    the Appellant and resulted in his ill-treatment whilst  in  Afghanistan
    had occurred at a time when he was not married to Z and  therefore  was
    not a family member and could not be said to be a member  of  a  common
    particular social group with Z.  The current fear it  seems  to  me  is
    essentially the same fear that the Appellant had prior to his departure
    - and necessarily prior to his marriage to Z - which therefore  can  be
    seen not to be contingent upon the fact of marriage but instead to be a
    result of personal animosity on the part of S for the Appellant's  role
    in frustrating his sexual ambitions towards Z.  This is  essentially  a
    personal dispute.

28.  In my judgment the way in which the Appellant responds to  question  55
    in the asylum interview is instructive.  He is asked, "So if [S] wanted
    to marry your wife and she is no longer in AFG why would  he  still  be
    after you?", to which the Appellant replied, "I was involved  with  her
    escape.  Those commanders are those types of people and  cannot  accept
    to be shamed in society or cannot accept humiliation".  It seems to  me
    that that is echoed by the Appellant's answer to the Presenting Officer
    at the appeal hearing when he was asked why  there  would  still  be  a
    problem if his and Z's families were no longer being threatened, and he
    responded that it would be a matter of 'honour'.

29.  In my judgment the real reason for the Appellant being targeted is  the
    personal animosity that has arisen between him and S by reason of those
    past events which, as I say, do not relate directly to his now marriage
    to Z.  In my judgment the risk to the Appellant does not arise for  the
    same reason as the risk to Z in Convention terms, and  does  not  arise
    for any other Convention reason.

30.  Accordingly, in those circumstances, as I say, I would  not  be  minded
    to find the brief and  poorly-reasoned  treatment  in  respect  of  the
    Convention reason issue to be a material error  of  law.   That  leaves
    then the question of risk, the possibility of engagement of  Article  2
    or  3  of  the  ECHR,  and  the  establishment  of  an  entitlement  to
    humanitarian protection.

31.  I have already indicated - and indeed as is manifest from  any  reading
    of paragraphs 16 and 17 (quoted above) - that the Judge makes no  clear
    findings as to the narrative of the Appellant's account or indeed as to
    his credibility.  At best it might be said that the Judge proceeded  on
    the basis of an acceptance of the Appellant's narrative and credibility
    although this is not overt.  It might be said that in stating that  his
    conclusions at paragraph 16 did not "in any way undermine the  findings
    of the previous decision in respect of [Z]" the Judge was in  substance
    accepting that all of the findings made by Judge Callender Smith stood,
    and that there was no reason shown to depart from such findings.

32.  If that be the case - and as I say it does seem to lack any clarity  of
    reasoning - but if, generously, that be the case the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge essentially comes down to the  following  two
    matters: that there had been no continuing threats in relation  to  the
    Appellant's or Z's family; and that the passage of time since 2015 made
    it "highly unlikely that there would be any long term  consequences  at
    this stage".

33.  Mr Eaton urges on me the proposition that the Appellant  had  indicated
    continuing threats in relation to  him  whilst  he  was  in  hiding  in
    Afghanistan.  That may be so, but I suspect what the Judge had in  mind
    was the Appellant's answer already quoted above at paragraph 6  of  the
    Judge's decision that there had  been  no  threats  to  either  of  the
    families since the Appellant's own departure from Afghanistan.  However
    what that fails to do is to engage with the matter that  the  Appellant
    asserted both at question 55 in interview and  again  in  his  evidence
    before the Judge: that his reappearance in Afghanistan would mean  that
    as a matter of honour - which  might  encompass  notions  of  vengeance
    and/or to preserve status or standing - S would seek to visit  harm  on
    him again.  The Judge fails to engage with that aspect of the  case  or
    otherwise offer any reason as to why there would not be a risk in  this
    regard.  This is particularly pertinent in  circumstances  where  Judge
    Callender Smith had found at paragraph 43 of his decision  that  S  was
    unlikely to change his attitudes or approaches in  the  future.   To  a
    very large  extent  the  failure  to  engage  in  this  aspect  of  the
    Appellant's case also undermines the Judge's stated  finding  that  the
    passage of time rendered it highly unlikely that  there  would  be  any
    long term consequences.  Mr Armstrong acknowledged during the course of
    submissions that the Judge does not appear to have offered any  reasons
    in support of such a  finding.   Indeed  in  my  judgment  it  is  pure
    supposition, and moreover is supposition without any attempt to  engage
    in the assertion of the Appellant or the findings  of  Judge  Callender
    Smith. As I have observed, it  has  nowhere  been  suggested  that  the
    findings in Z's appeal should be deviated from in any material respect;
    indeed the Judge himself seems to acknowledge that those findings  were
    "not in any way to [be] undermine[d]".  If  that  is  the  case  it  is
    difficult to reconcile Judge  Paul's  ultimate  conclusions  with  such
    findings: certainly Judge Paul offers no such reasoned  reconciliation.



34.  For those reasons I do find a material error of law in the approach  of
    the First-tier Tribunal. The decision lacks clear  findings  and  clear
    reasons. The error is such that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal
    Judge must be set aside.

35.  I turn then to the issue  of  remaking  the  decision  in  the  appeal.
    After discussion with the representatives  I  am  content  that  it  is
    appropriate to remake  the  decision  in  the  appeal  without  further
    evidence.  The Respondent's case is clear with reference  to  the  RFRL
    and the observations made by Mr Armstrong  during  the  course  of  the
    hearing today.   Essentially,  without  necessarily  going  behind  the
    primary facts of the  Appellant's  narrative  account,  the  Respondent
    observes that the Appellant at no point sought to avail himself of  the
    protection of the authorities in Afghanistan; the Respondent also prays
    in aid in this regard - as per the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  -  the
    passage of time, and otherwise points generally to the availability  of
    state protection.  As  regards  the  Appellant,  Mr  Eaton  essentially
    relies in respect of risk on the  acceptance  -  or  an  invitation  to
    accept - the narrative account of the Appellant, the findings of  Judge
    Callender Smith based on  substantially  the  same  evidence  that  was
    before the Tribunal herein, the absence of any evidence to suggest  any
    material change in country situation since the expert report was  filed
    in Z's case, and moreover also directs my attention to the case  of  RQ
    [2008] UKAIT 00013 which is a country guidance  case  which  in  effect
    suggests that where a person has been individually  targeted  there  is
    not inevitably effective  state  protection  upon  relocation  even  in
    Kabul.

36.  I prefer the submissions on behalf of the Appellant.  It  seems  to  me
    that the findings of Judge Callender  Smith  may  be  adopted  for  the
    purposes of this appeal, albeit that such findings require to be viewed
    through the prism of  the  fact  that  I  am  looking  at  a  different
    Appellant. The findings so far as Z's history are concerned  have  been
    expressly accepted by the Respondent; as regards country situation  and
    the status and standing of S, nothing has been advanced to suggest  any
    material change of circumstance. Accordingly, in substance the findings
    of Judge Callender Smith provide very good  reasons  why,  just  as  it
    would not have been helpful for  Z  to  approach  the  authorities  for
    protection, it would not  have  been  to  the  Appellant's  benefit  to
    approach the authorities in Afghanistan for protection, and  would  not
    presently be of benefit - "[S] is the person who would  prevail  rather
    than anyone else".  Equally  the  findings  in  respect  of  the  'long
    shadow' of S and the lack of likelihood of him changing his  'attitudes
    or approach' apply equally to the Appellant's case.   In  my  judgement
    such a person who maintains a position or status through a  combination
    of force and threat, it may be  reasonably  inferred,  will  reasonably
    likely 'follow through' on any such threats lest he  be  considered  to
    display weakness otherwise. In those circumstances I find that there is
    a risk to the Appellant upon his return to Afghanistan of serious  harm
    such as to engage either or both Articles 2 and 3 of the ECHR  with  no
    prospect of availing himself of state protection or avoiding such  harm
    by internal relocation.

37.  For the reasons already indicated I do not accept that the  Appellant's
    case engages the Refugee Convention.

38.  In consequences I remake the  decision  by  allowing  the  appeal  with
    reference to Articles 2 and 3 of the ECHR and thereby pursuant  to  the
    principles of humanitarian protection.

Notice of Decision

39.  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal was flawed for  material  error
    of law and is set aside.

40.  I remake  the  decision  in  the  appeal.  The  appeal  is  allowed  on
    humanitarian protection grounds

41.  An anonymity direction is made, not least to provide  consistency  with
    the anonymity direction still in force in respect  of  the  Appellant's
    wife's appeal, and to maintain her anonymity.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.


The above represents a corrected transcript of ex tempore reasons  given  at
the conclusion of the hearing.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

A fee award would be appropriate but there is no fee paid so no award is  to
be made.
