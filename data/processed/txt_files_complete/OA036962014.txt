For the Appellant:     No appearance
For the Respondent:    Mr A McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Before the Upper Tribunal  the  Secretary  of  State  now  becomes  the
    appellant.  However, for the avoidance of confusion, I  shall  continue
    to refer to the parties as they were before the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. At the hearing before me there was no appearance by or on behalf of the
    appellant.  Notice of the hearing had been sent on 9th June 2015 to the
    appellant and the sponsor at their recorded  addresses  on  file.   The
    notices were not returned in the post.  Having  satisfied  myself  that
    notice of the hearing had been given to the relevant parties  and  that
    it was in the interests of justice to proceed with the hearing,  I  did
    so in the absence of the appellant and  sponsor  or  representation  on
    their behalf having regard to the provisions of  paragraph  38  of  the
    2008 Procedure Rules.

Background

 3. On 7th May 2015 Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Fisher gave permission
    to the respondent to appeal against the decision of Judge of the First-
    tier Tribunal P J M Hollingworth in which he allowed the appeal against
    the decision of  the  respondent  to  refuse  entry  clearance  to  the
    appellant as a partner under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.

Error on a point of law

 4.  In  granting  permission  Judge  Fisher  noted  that  the  grounds  of
    application by the respondent asserted that the judge erred in  law  by
    finding that the financial requirements of Appendix FM  were  met  even
    though, as the sponsor had commenced employment in July  2013  and  the
    application was made on 14th October 2013, he had  been  in  employment
    for less than six months before the date of application.  Although  the
    judge had decided that financial sufficiency had been shown at the date
    of refusal he had not explained how the requirements of Appendix FM-SE,
    particularly those set out in paragraphs 2(a)(ii) and (13)(b) had  been
    met.  Under those provisions the appellant had to show  twelve  months'
    salaried employment for the sponsor if employed by his current employer
    for less than six months and the calculation of annual income had to be
    the total of the gross annual salary from employment  at  the  date  of
    application plus any non-employment income received in the twelve month
    period to the date of application and  any  state  or  private  pension
    received by that person or his partner.

 5. At the hearing Mr McVeety confirmed that the respondent relied upon the
    grounds.  He emphasised that six months of employment  with  a  current
    employer had not been shown under the provisions of Appendix FM-SE from
    1st July 2013 when the sponsor commenced his employment to the date  of
    application on 10th October 2013 nor had 12  months  of  employment  to
    that date been shown.  The  appellant  could  not,  therefore,  succeed
    under the Rules although she had the option to make a fresh application
    bearing in mind that, according to the decision, the sponsor was  still
    in the employment taken up on 1st July 2013.

 6. Having considered the matter for a few moments I announced that  I  was
    satisfied that the decision showed an error on a point of law  and  now
    give my reasons for that conclusion.

 7. The decision  shows  that,  although  the  judge  calculated  that  the
    sponsor's pay at the date of hearing on 24th February 2015 was  greater
    than the annual income requirements set out in paragraph  E-ECP.3.1  of
    ï¿½18,600, that income  had  not  been  proved  in  accordance  with  the
    evidential requirements set out in Appendix FM-SE particularly  as,  at
    the date of application, the sponsor  had  not  been  employed  by  his
    current employer for more than six months.

 8. Although the terms of the respondent's refusal makes specific reference
    to the need to comply with Appendix FM-SE in addition to  Appendix  FM,
    the decision does not show that the judge gave consideration  to  those
    evidential  requirements.  He  erroneously  made  his  calculation   of
    adequacy of income based upon employment to the date of hearing and did
    not take  account  of  either  the  6  month  or  12  month  employment
    alternatives. Further, Appendix FM-SE makes the clear requirement  that
    the relevant date for calculation of income is the date of  application
    not the date of hearing or decision.  The judge therefore made an error
    such that the decision cannot stand and should be re-made.

Re-making the Decision

 9. Mr McVeety argued that the appeal had to be dismissed  because  of  the
    inability of the appellant to meet the requirements  of  the  Rules  in
    relation to income.  Although human rights issues  did  not  appear  to
    have been put to the judge at  the  hearing  they  were  certainly  not
    examined by him because of his decision under  the  Rules,  Mr  McVeety
    argued that the human rights claim had to be dismissed.

Conclusions

10. In immigration appeals the burden of proof is on the appellant and  the
    standard of proof is a balance of probabilities.  In  this  appeal  the
    relevant date for consideration of financial information  is  that  set
    out in Appendix FM-SE of the Rules and is the date of application.

11. It is evident that, at the date of application,  the  sponsor  had  not
    been in employment with his  current  employer  for  six  months.   The
    refusal decision of 16th October 2014 makes the  relevant  point  clear
    indicating that the sponsor had only produced payslips for July, August
    and September 2013 because he had  been  employed  for  less  than  six
    months with his current employer.  The documents provided also did  not
    reflect twelve months of earnings to the date of application.

12. The subsequent  documentation  produced  by  the  appellant  could  not
    overcome the difficulty highlighted by the decision.  The documentation
    provided at the hearing along with the oral evidence of the sponsor may
    well have shown income which, at the date of the hearing,  amounted  to
    more than the required amount in a twelve month  period  such  evidence
    could not be taken into consideration  because  of  the  provisions  of
    Appendix FM-SE.  Thus, the appeal  cannot  be  allowed  on  immigration
    grounds.

13. Human rights issues were not raised in the grounds of appeal before the
    First Tier Tribunal nor have the appellant or sponsor submitted further
    information which might relate  to  a  human  rights  claim,  with  the
    exception of information showing that the parties were in a  subsisting
    relationship.  The latter being a matter which was decided in favour of
    the appellant and has not been questioned by the respondent.

14. On the basis that the parties have not pursued a human rights claim and
    taking into consideration that a further application can  now  be  made
    which may meet the income threshold requirements of the Rules, I do not
    deal with that matter.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shows an error on a  point  of  law.
I set aside the decision and re-make it by dismissing the appeal.

Anonymity

Anonymity  was  not  requested  in  this  appeal  nor  do  I   consider   it
appropriate.
