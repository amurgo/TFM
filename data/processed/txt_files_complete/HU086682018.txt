Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr M Sarwar, Legal representative, Lexton Law
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr T Lindsay, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. By a decision promulgated on 25 November 2019 (a  copy  of  which  is
       attached) the Upper Tribunal set aside a decision of  the  First-tier
       Tribunal promulgated on 14 May 2019. We now re-make that decision.




A. Background

    2. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan who was born,  and  has  spent
       nearly all of her life, in the United Arab Emirates.  On 2 May  2016,
       whilst pregnant with her first (and only) child, she travelled to the
       UK from Dubai as a visitor with leave until 6 July 2016.

    3. On 4 July 2016 she applied for leave to remain in the UK on the basis
       that she was 30 weeks pregnant and had been advised that it  was  not
       safe for her to travel because of previous  miscarriages  ("the  2016
       application"). In the  2016  application  she  requested  six  months
       leave.

    4. On 6 September 2016 the appellant gave birth to her daughter, who  is
       a British citizen.

    5. The appellant's partner (who is her  child's  father)  is  a  British
       citizen who has two teenage sons (born in February 2003 and September
       2004) from a previous relationship.

    6. In January 2018 the appellant varied  her  application  in  order  to
       apply for leave to remain on the basis of her family  life  with  her
       partner and child ("the 2018 application").

    7. On 19 March 2018 the respondent refused the application on the  basis
       that:

        a. the appellant did not qualify  for  leave  as  a  partner  under
           Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules because  (i)  she  had  not
           provided evidence to show she had been living with  her  partner
           for at least two years and therefore she was not a "partner"  as
           defined in GEN.1.2. of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules; and
           (ii) she was in the UK as a visitor and therefore  by  operation
           of E-LTRP.2.1 of Appendix FM was  not  eligible  to  be  granted
           leave as a partner even if (which was accepted) there  would  be
           insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life  with  her   partner
           continuing outside the UK;

        b. she did not meet any of the private life routes to  leave  under
           paragraph 276ADE(1); and

        c. refusing leave  would  not  result  in  an  unjustifiably  harsh
           consequence that would breach Article 8 because, having  entered
           the UK as a visitor, she had no legitimate expectation of  being
           able to remain permanently;  and  her  daughter's  rights  as  a
           British citizen would not be denied by her removal  because  the
           child could remain in the UK with her father.

B. Scope of the Appeal and Issues in Dispute

    8. Mr Lindsay, in his skeleton argument, accepted that:

        a. there are insurmountable obstacles  to  the  appellant's  family
           life continuing outside of the UK; and

        b. it would not be reasonable or proportionate for the family  unit
           to be indefinitely separated.

    9. He stated that, on the facts of the case, the appellant  is  expected
       to leave the UK for only a limited period of time in order  to  apply
       for entry clearance to join her partner and that the  "narrow  issue"
       in the appeal is  whether  her  temporary  removal  from  the  UK  is
       proportionate. In his submissions, Mr Lindsay clarified  that  it  is
       the respondent's case that the appellant will be able  to  travel  to
       Pakistan in order to apply for entry clearance and  that  it  is  not
       contended that she would  be  able  to  return  to  the  United  Arab
       Emirates.

   10. The appellant's primary case is that respondent's assumption that she
       would be able to re-enter the UK from Pakistan  is  mistaken  as  she
       would be unable to satisfy the financial eligibility requirements for
       entry as a partner. Accordingly, she contends that her appeal  should
       be allowed because the consequence of her removal will be  permanent,
       or at least long-term, exclusion from the UK which the respondent has
       conceded is not reasonable or proportionate.

   11. In the alternative, the appellant argues that if (which she does  not
       accept) she would be able to re-enter the UK  after  only  a  limited
       period of time, her removal wound be disproportionate under article 8
       ECHR for three reasons.

   12. First, she argues that her removal would be disproportionate  because
       she meets the requirements of the Immigration Rules (both under para.
       276ADE(1)(vi)  and  Appendix  FM)  and  satisfying   the   Rules   is
       determinative of an article 8 appeal,  as  explained  by  the  Senior
       President of Tribunals (Sir Ernest Ryder) in  TZ  (Pakistan)  and  PG
       (India) v The Secretary of State for the Home Department [2018]  EWCA
       Civ 1109 at paragraph 34:

           "[W]here a  person  satisfies  the  Rules,  whether  or  not  by
           reference to an article 8 informed requirement, then  this  will
           be positively determinative of that person's article  8  appeal,
           provided their case engages article 8(1), for  the  very  reason
           that it would then be disproportionate for  that  person  to  be
           removed."

   13. Second, she submits that there is  a  principle,   derived  from  the
       House of Lords' judgment in Chikwamba v SSHD  [2008]  UKHL  40,  that
       there is no public interest in removing a person from the UK in order
       to make an entry clearance from  abroad  that  would  be  certain  to
       succeed (referred to by Mr Sarwar as the "Chikwamba principle").  The
       appellant's case is that as she would succeed in her application from
       outside the  UK  it  follows  that  she  falls  squarely  within  the
       Chikwamba principle and her appeal should be allowed on that basis.

   14. Third, she argues that it would  not  be  reasonable  to  expect  her
       daughter to leave the UK (even for a  temporary  period,  whilst  her
       application  for  entry  clearance  is  pending)  and  therefore,  in
       accordance with s117B(6) of the Nationality  Immigration  and  Asylum
       Act 2002 ("the 2002 Act"), the public interest does not  require  her
       removal.

   15. The appellant has advanced a further argument as to why it  would  be
       unlawful to remove her from the UK. This contention is  that  she  is
       entitled to a right of residence in order to avoid her daughter being
       deprived of the genuine enjoyment of the substance  of  her  European
       Union Citizenship rights in accordance with Ruiz  Zambrano  v  Office
       national de l'emploi (Case C-34/09) and Patel v  Secretary  of  State
       for the Home Department [2019] UKSC 59.

C. Evidence

  Evidence of the appellant

   16. The appellant adopted her witness statement dated 15 April 2019.

   17. In the statement she stated that she lives with her partner,  who  is
       her fianc�.

   18. She also stated that she is the main carer  for  their  daughter  and
       that her partner finds it difficult to undertake day-to-day care  for
       the child. She stated that if she were to  leave  the  UK  she  would
       bring her daughter with her as her  partner  would  not  be  able  to
       combine caring for her with his work commitments as well as the  care
       he provides for his  two  sons  (from  a  previous  relationship)  on
       weekends and during school holidays. In oral evidence, she  explained
       that her daughter started nursery in November 2019 and commented that
       this is going well.

   19. The appellant also stated in her statement that she was born in Dubai
       where she has lived most of her life. In oral  evidence,  she  stated
       that her mother died in 2012, she has three siblings  in  Dubai,  and
       her brother and father live in the UK.

   20. Both in her statement and orally the appellant stated  that  she  has
       only ever been to Pakistan on short visits (staying in hotels, rather
       than with family or friends) and that she does not  have  any  family
       members in Pakistan upon whom she could rely for support. She  stated
       that she had not even visited Pakistan until she was 15 years old and
       that she would find it very difficult to settle  and  integrate  into
       Pakistan.

   21. She stated that she cannot return to Dubai as she  does  not  have  a
       valid visa.

   22. She also stated that her partner "will not allow" her to  take  their
       daughter abroad.

   23. The appellant was asked by Mr Lindsay whether, when she stated in the
       2016 application that she only wished to  remain  in  the  UK  for  a
       further 6 months her intention, at that time, was to return to  Dubai
       or relocate to Pakistan. The appellant's response was that she  would
       have tried to return to Dubai but following the expiry of her visa at
       the end of 2016 this was no longer an option. She  also  stated  that
       because her father was now living in the UK she was unable  to  renew
       her visa to live in Dubai. She stated that she did not remember  when
       her father moved to the UK.

   24. When asked by Mr Lindsay why she did not leave the UK as she said she
       would in the 2016 application, she responded that she did not receive
       a response to her application from the Secretary of State.  She  also
       stated that her daughter had asthma, flu and respiratory problems and
       because of this her partner did not allow her to take the  child  out
       of the UK. She acknowledged that no  evidence  about  her  daughter's
       health had been submitted but said it must be in hospital records.

   25. In cross-examination, she said she could not  take  her  daughter  to
       Pakistan, even for a short time, because they would have  nowhere  to
       stay. She also stated that her daughter is well  settled  at  nursery
       and is too young to go to Pakistan with her. She added that  whenever
       the appellant had been to Pakistan she had fallen ill.

   26. She emphasised in her oral  evidence  that  she  would  be  alone  in
       Pakistan. In response to questions posed by Mr Lindsay about extended
       family, she stated  that  she  did  not  know  anyone  and  that  any
       connection to wider family she had in the past was via her mother who
       is deceased and she has no knowledge about any extended family.

   27. Mr Lindsay asked the appellant  about  her  Pakistani  identity  card
       which records a permanent address in Pakistan. Her response was  that
       the address was for a relative of her mother who is now deceased. She
       added, following a question posed by Mr Sarwar, that it is  necessary
       to have a permanent address to obtain an ID card from Pakistan.

   28. The appellant was asked about the reference to an uncle  in  Pakistan
       in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal. She stated that this  was
       a relative of her mother who is deceased. When asked to clarify,  she
       stated that the relative was deceased but she did not  know  when  he
       died or if he had children. She thought the address on her ID card is
       that of this deceased relative.

   29. She stated that she did not know if her partner (who is of  Pakistani
       heritage) had family in Pakistan and that they  had  never  discussed
       this.

   30. In response to questions about her partner's work, she said  that  he
       is a carpet fitter who works "on and off" earning  between  �200  and
       �300 a week.

   31. Mr Lindsay asked the appellant about the  2016  application  and  the
       2018 application. She stated that the forms  were  completed  on  her
       behalf by her solicitor.




  Evidence of the appellant's partner

   32. The appellant's partner adopted his witness statement dated 15  April
       2019.

   33. In his statement he stated that the appellant is the main  carer  for
       their daughter and that because of his work commitments he is  unable
       to look after her. He also stated that he would not be able  to  cope
       with looking after her.

   34. He stated that he and the appellant enjoy a family life with his  two
       sons from a previous marriage.

   35. He also stated that due to the  nature  of  his  work  and  financial
       commitment of supporting three children he would find it difficult to
       meet the financial requirements for his partner to be  granted  entry
       clearance.

   36. In oral evidence he stated that he is a carpet fitter on a zero hours
       contract earning �250-�300 a week "cash in hand". He stated  that  he
       was a carpet shop proprietor a number of years ago for a short period
       but it had not gone well. In response to questions about his  income,
       he said that he would not be able to earn �19,000 - �20,000, which he
       understood was the level required for his partner to be  admitted  to
       the UK. When asked why, in the 2018 application, it was said that  he
       earned  �1,600 a month after tax, his response was  that  his  income
       goes up and down and he can have some good and some bad  months;  but
       he does not earn near that amount and it is impossible to  do  so  in
       his line of work.

   37. He stated that all his family live in the UK and he does not have any
       extended family in Pakistan.

   38. He stated that his partner used to have an uncle in Pakistan but that
       he has now moved to the UK. He stated that his partner speaks to this
       uncle on the telephone now and then. He also stated that his  partner
       did not have any other extended family in Pakistan.  In  response  to
       Mr Lindsay pointing out that the appellant had  said  her  uncle  had
       died, he stated that this was probably a different uncle and that  he
       did not really know the details.

  Documentary evidence

   39. In the 2016 application form the appellant stated that her  place  of
       birth was Dubai. She stated that she was 30 weeks  pregnant  and  the
       purpose of the application was to obtain a further 6 months leave  in
       order to have her baby and recover fully before leaving the UK.

   40. In the 2018 application form she gave Pakistan as her place of birth.
       She stated that the relationship with her partner began in  2015  and
       that they began cohabiting in May 2016. She stated that  her  partner
       earned approximately �1,600  a  month  after  income  tax  and  other
       deductions.

   41. The appellant's daughter's birth certificate records  the  occupation
       of the appellant's partner as "carpet shop proprietor".

   42. On the birth certificate of  his  oldest  son  (born  in  1982),  the
       appellant's partner is described as a  "restaurant  proprietor".  The
       birth certificate of his younger son (born  in  2003)  describes  his
       occupation as "sales assistant".

   43. The appellant's identification card from Pakistan (issued in  January
       2010 and expiring in January 2020) records an address in Dubai as her
       present address and under the heading "permanent address" records  an
       address in Pakistan.

   44. The appellant submitted a letter from her daughter's nursery  stating
       that the child is progressing well and has developed friendships with
       peers; a letter from her GP confirming she  is  registered  with  the
       practice (along with her partner and child); a letter from  a  friend
       confirming a longstanding friendship; and a letter from  a  neighbour
       attesting to the good character of the appellant and her partner.

   45. The documentary evidence before us  regarding  timescales  for  entry
       clearance applications to join a family member in  the  UK  indicates
       that it takes up to 12 weeks  from  attending  the  visa  application
       centre appointment to receive a decision, or 30 days if the  priority
       service is paid for.

  Assessment of the evidence

   46. Mr Lindsay submitted that the appellant and her partner had sought to
       obscure and minimise their connection to Pakistan. He argued that the
       evidence pointed to the appellant having an uncle in Pakistan who  is
       sufficiently close to her that she was able to use  his  address  for
       her identification document. He maintained that the appellant and her
       partner gave contradictory evidence about the  uncle:  the  appellant
       stated that he is deceased whereas the evidence of  her  partner  was
       that the appellant speaks to him on the telephone.

   47. Mr Lindsay argued that it is not possible to conclude, based  on  the
       oral and other evidence, that the appellant  and  her  partner  would
       face difficulties meeting the financial eligibility  requirement  for
       entry clearance. He noted that in the 2018 application form the after
       tax income of the appellant's partner  was  recorded  as  �1,600  per
       month (a sum which is sufficient to meet  the  financial  eligibility
       requirements) and that on his  daughter's  birth  certificate  he  is
       described as a proprietor of a carpet shop. He submitted  that  there
       was no plausible explanation for the discrepancy between  the  income
       stated in the 2018 application  form  (�1,600  per  month)  and  that
       stated in oral evidence (�250 - �300 a week).

   48. Mr Sarwar argued that the evidence of the appellant and  her  partner
       about the appellant's uncle was not  inconsistent  as  the  appellant
       could have more than one uncle and her partner was not asked  if  any
       of the appellant's relatives had  died.  Mr  Sarwar  noted  that  the
       appellant's Pakistani ID card was issued whilst her mother was  still
       alive, which is consistent with her claim that her only contact  with
       extended family in Pakistan was via her mother.

   49. He argued that the evidence of the appellant and  her  partner  shows
       that neither have family ties in Pakistan and that there is no one in
       Pakistan who would be in a position to  provide  the  appellant  with
       support or accommodation. He highlighted that the appellant has lived
       her whole life in Dubai and has no experience of life in Pakistan.

   50. With respect to the  prospect  of  the  appellant  succeeding  in  an
       application for entry clearance, Mr Sarwar noted that the appellant's
       partner would need evidence, such as wage slips  and  self-assessment
       returns, to prove his income which would not be possible  given  that
       he works  "cash  in  hand".  He  noted  that  the  reference  to  the
       appellant's partner being a shop proprietor was  3.5  years  earlier,
       and the evidence was that the shop had not been successful. Mr Sarwar
       submitted that the evidence shows that if the  appellant  is  removed
       from the UK she will not be able to return.

   51. Mr Sarwar also submitted that the evidence shows that  the  appellant
       has not used deception and has "done  everything  through  the  front
       door". He argued that she had intended to return to  Dubai  to  apply
       for settlement but because of her child's health issues was forced to
       change her plans. He also contended that because of the delay by  the
       respondent the appellant has established roots in the UK and now  has
       a close relationship with her partner's two sons.

   52. We agree with Mr Lindsay's assessment of the evidence. It is apparent
       that rather than state matters in a straightforward way the appellant
       and her partner have sought to present their evidence in a  way  that
       they believe will assist them. An example of  this  is  the  evidence
       given about the appellant's partner's income. In the 2018 application
       form the appellant  stated  that  her  partner  earned  approximately
       �1,600  a  month  after  income  tax  and  other   deductions.   This
       corresponds to �19,200 before tax a year and would be  sufficient  to
       meet the financial eligibility requirements under  Appendix  FM.  The
       appellant stated in oral evidence that this form was completed  by  a
       solicitor on her behalf. She  would  have  been  aware  (through  her
       solicitor) of the importance of providing  accurate  information.  We
       note that at the time this form was completed the appellant is likely
       to have believed that it was in her interests for her partner to have
       an income that met the requirements under Appendix FM.  In  contrast,
       at the hearing before us, where we were told in  oral  evidence  that
       the appellant's partner earns �250-�300 per  week  (corresponding  to
       �13,000 - �15,600 per year), the appellant was seeking to convey  the
       opposite - that her partner's income did not meet the threshold under
       Appendix FM.

   53. We found  several  aspects  of  the  oral  evidence  problematic.  In
       particular:

        a. The appellant stated that she had never spoken  to  her  partner
           about whether he has any family in Pakistan (even though  he  is
           of Pakistani heritage). We find  it  wholly  unbelievable  that,
           faced with the possibility of being returned  to  Pakistan  with
           their daughter, the appellant and her  partner  would  not  have
           discussed whether the appellant's  partner  has  any  family  or
           friends in Pakistan who might be able to provide assistance.

        b. The appellant stated that she had no idea when her father  moved
           to the UK. We do not find it credible that she did not even know
           whether her father was already in the UK when she  came  to  the
           UK, given her claim to be entirely dependent upon  him  for  her
           right to reside in the United Arab Emirates.

        c. The appellant stated that she does not know  whether  her  uncle
           had any children. Even  if  she  only  heard  about  her  family
           through her mother and is not in contact with them  herself,  it
           is not plausible that she would not know if she has any cousins.

        d. The appellant claimed that when her family visited Pakistan from
           Dubai they would stay in hotels and not visit family;  and  that
           she has never met any extended family. However,  this  does  not
           stand with the  appellant's  acknowledgment  that  her  mother's
           brother lived in Pakistan, the evidence of her partner that  she
           speaks to her  uncle  on  the  telephone,  and  the  documentary
           evidence - in the form of  her  Pakistani  identity  document  -
           which gives an address that she accepted was probably his as her
           "permanent address".

        e. It is not credible that the appellant, if she genuinely intended
           to return to Dubai after her child was born (as  she  stated  in
           oral evidence),  would  not  have  taken  steps  to  ensure  she
           remained entitled to reside in  Dubai  before  her  United  Arab
           Emirates' visa expired at the end  of  2016.   Similarly,  given
           that she had no basis for believing she would be able to  remain
           in the UK, it is not plausible that, if moving to Pakistan would
           be as challenging as she claims, she would not have taken  steps
           to ensure that she would be able to return to Dubai in order  to
           avoid the risk of having to relocate to Pakistan.

   54. We also found that there was an inconsistency between the appellant's
       claim that she has never had contact with any family in Pakistan  and
       the evidence of her partner that she speaks on the telephone  to  her
       uncle who recently moved to the UK from Pakistan. We were  left  with
       the clear impression, following Mr Lindsay's cross-examination of the
       appellant, that she failed to mention her uncle  -  and  then  stated
       that he was deceased - as part of an attempt to minimise and downplay
       the extent of her ties to Pakistan. We  do  not  accept  Mr  Sarwar's
       attempt to suggest the appellant and  her  partner  might  have  been
       talking about different people.

   55.  In  addition,  we  found  the  evidence  about  the  income  of  the
       appellant's  partner  to  be  unreliable  not  only  because  of  the
       substantial  discrepancy  between  the  income  stated  on  the  2018
       application  form  and  the  oral  evidence  but  also  because   the
       appellant's partner contradicted himself by stating in answer to  one
       question from Mr Lindsay that he could earn �1,600 in  a  good  month
       and in response to another question that it would  be  impossible  to
       earn that much as a carpet fitter.

   56. We also noted that the  appellant's  evidence  about  her  daughter's
       health difficulties was not  corroborated  by  the  letter  from  the
       child's nursery, which describes her as healthy; or the  letter  from
       the appellant's GP practice, which includes  no  reference  to  there
       ever having been any health concerns. Likewise, there was no  medical
       or other evidence to corroborate the appellant's claim that  she  was
       warned not to travel when pregnant because of a miscarriage risk.

   57. For these reasons, we approach the witness evidence of the  appellant
       and her partner with a high  degree  of  caution.  Moreover,  we  are
       unable to rely on their oral evidence about the presence of family in
       Pakistan and the  earnings  of  the  appellant's  partner  as  it  is
       apparent to us that they have sought to portray these  matters  in  a
       way that they believe would be favourable to the appellant's claim.

D. Findings of Fact

   58. The appellant was born, and has lived most of her life, in the United
       Arab Emirates.

   59. The appellant is in a genuine and subsisting  relationship  with  her
       partner who is a British citizen. They have a  daughter,  born  on  6
       September 2016, who is a British citizen.

   60. The appellant lives with her partner and child as a family unit.  Her
       partner has two  (British  citizen)  teenage  sons  from  a  previous
       relationship  who  he  sees  regularly  (primarily  on  weekends  and
       holidays). The  appellant  has  developed  a  relationship  with  her
       partner's sons.

   61. The appellant travelled to the UK from the United  Arab  Emirates  in
       May 2016 (whilst pregnant with  the  child  of  her  British  citizen
       partner) as a visitor. Their relationship was subsisting at the time.
       The appellant claims that her intention was to return to  the  United
       Arab Emirates and  it  is  only  because  of  difficulties  with  the
       pregnancy, and then with her child's health, that she did not do  so.
       However, she did not adduce any medical evidence to support her claim
       to have been unable to return to  the  United  Arab  Emirates  either
       whilst pregnant or shortly after the child  was  born.  Nor  has  she
       explained why she did not return to Dubai prior to  her  United  Arab
       Emirates residency visa expiring in order to avoid a situation  where
       her only option, other than to remain in the UK, would be  to  return
       to Pakistan, where she claims she would be  without  any  support  or
       accommodation. We have no  doubt,  and  find  as  a  fact,  that  the
       appellant entered the UK with  the  intention  of  giving  birth  and
       remaining with her partner permanently. We also  find  that  she  had
       this intention when she completed the 2016 application form in  which
       she stated she only wished to remain in the  UK  for  a  further  six
       months.

   62. The appellant has never lived in Pakistan. However,  along  with  her
       immediate family, she has maintained a  connection  to  the  country,
       visiting on several occasions. We find it far more  likely  than  not
       that on those visits she stayed with family, rather than  in  hotels.
       We also find - in  the  absence  of  any  evidence  pointing  to  the
       contrary - that it is more likely than not that she is familiar  with
       the language, culture,  religion  and  societal  norms  of  Pakistan,
       having grown up in  a  Pakistani  family  and  within  the  Pakistani
       community in Dubai.

   63. For the reasons explained above,  the  evidence  we  heard  from  the
       appellant and her partner about the presence of (and her relationship
       with) extended family in Pakistan was not credible. We find  it  more
       likely than not that the appellant has - and maintains a relationship
       with - extended family in Pakistan.

   64. The appellant's partner works as a carpet fitter. He  works  under  a
       "zero hours contract" taking on work  when  available.  The  evidence
       indicates that he has  extensive  experience  in  the  field,  having
       previously been a carpet shop proprietor.  In  the  2018  application
       form the appellant indicated that her partner's income was at a level
       that  would  be  sufficient  to  meet   the   financial   eligibility
       requirements  under  Appendix  FM.  Her  (and  her  partner's)   oral
       evidence, however, was that his income is  substantially  below  that
       level and it would not be possible for him to meet the threshold.  We
       have explained above why we are unable to give any weight to the oral
       evidence we heard on this issue. We find it more likely than not that
       the  appellant's  partner's  current  income  meets   the   financial
       eligibility threshold but that even if it does  not  he  could  in  a
       short space of time increase his income (by, for example,  taking  on
       more carpet fitting work from different sources) in order to meet the
       threshold.

   65. Taking into consideration the time it is likely to  take  to  compile
       the necessary evidence for an entry clearance application, to  secure
       an appointment in Pakistan, and to  receive  the  decision  once  the
       application is made, we find that the appellant will be out of the UK
       (in Pakistan, awaiting a grant of entry clearance) for between 4  and
       9 months.

   66. The appellant is the  primary  carer  for  her  daughter.  Given  her
       partner's work commitments and the child's  young  age,  it  is  more
       likely than not that the appellant will bring her daughter  with  her
       to Pakistan if she is required to leave the UK.

   67. The appellant's daughter is a healthy child with no developmental  or
       other problems.

   68. There was no evidence to suggest that the appellant  has  any  health
       difficulties and therefore  we  find  that  she  does  not  have  any
       physical or mental health problems.

E. Analysis

  The respondent's concession that it would  be  disproportionate  for  the
  appellant to be removed unless she would be able to re-enter the UK

   69. The respondent has conceded that there are  insurmountable  obstacles
       to family life continuing outside the UK and that  it  would  not  be
       reasonable or proportionate for the appellant's  family  unit  to  be
       indefinitely separated. It follows, therefore, that if the  appellant
       would be  unable  to  re-enter  the  UK  after  her  removal  for  an
       indefinite (or lengthy) period her appeal would fall to be allowed on
       the basis of the respondent's concession.

   70. The appeal cannot, however, succeed on this  basis  because  we  have
       found that the appellant will be able to re-enter the UK within 4 - 9
       months of her removal, and therefore there will not be indefinite, or
       lengthy, separation.

  Entitlement to leave under the Immigration Rules

   71. Mr Sarwar argued that the appellant  satisfies  the  requirements  of
       para. EX.1(b) of Appendix FM (insurmountable obstacles to family life
       with a partner continuing outside the UK) and her  appeal  should  be
       allowed on this basis. Mr Lindsay argued,  in  response,  that  para.
       EX.1 is not freestanding and the appeal cannot succeed under Appendix
       FM because the appellant was a visitor in the UK when  she  made  her
       application.

   72. Mr Lindsay is plainly correct. It is  not  sufficient,  in  order  to
       satisfy the requirements of Appendix FM,  that  a  partner  of  a  UK
       citizen  is  able  to  show  that  there  would  be   "insurmountable
       obstacles" to the relationship continuing outside the UK. It is  also
       necessary  to  satisfy  certain  of  the   eligibility   requirements
       specified in paragraph E - LTRP, including that  the  applicant  must
       not be in the UK as a visitor (E-LTRP.2.1). The appellant  had  leave
       as a visitor when she submitted the 2016 application and  that  leave
       continued - and continues  -  by  operation  of  section  3C  of  the
       Immigration Act 1971.  She  therefore  does  not  satisfy  the  Rules
       because  she  does  not  meet  the  eligibility  immigration   status
       requirement at E-LTRP.2.1.

   73. Mr Sarwar also argued that because the appellant has never lived, and
       has no family or accommodation, in  Pakistan,  there  would  be  very
       significant obstacles to her integration in  Pakistan  and  therefore
       she  satisfies  the  requirements  of  para.  276ADE(1)(vi)  of   the
       Immigration Rules. Mr Lindsay argued  that  this  contention  has  no
       merit because under para. 276ADE(1) it is necessary to  look  at  the
       position at the  date  of  the  application  and  at  that  date  the
       appellant had only been in the UK for a very short period of time.

   74.  We  reject  the  argument  that  the   appellant   satisfies   para.
       276ADE(1)(vi) for two reasons. First, at the date of the  appellant's
       application (which, as submitted by Mr Lindsay, is the relevant date)
       the appellant would, by her own account, have been able to return  to
       the United Arab Emirates, a country in which she has lived nearly all
       her life and in which she has close family. Clearly,  she  would  not
       face very significant obstacles  integrating  into  the  United  Arab
       Emirates.

   75. Second, and in any event, there are not very significant obstacles to
       the appellant integrating into Pakistan. In Kamara v SSHD [2016] EWCA
       Civ 813 Sales LJ explained that the concept of integration is a broad
       one.  He stated:

           "The idea of integration calls for a broad  evaluative  judgment
           to be made as to whether the individual will  be  enough  of  an
           insider in terms of understanding how life  in  the  society  in
           that other country is carried on and a capacity  to  participate
           in it so as to have a  reasonable  opportunity  to  be  accepted
           there, to be able to operate on a  day  by  day  basis  in  that
           society and to build up within a reasonable time  a  variety  of
           human  relationships  to  give  substance  to  the  individual's
           private or family life".

   76. Although  the  appellant  has  never  lived  in  Pakistan  and  would
       consequently  face  some  difficulties  and  challenges  establishing
       herself in the country, she is familiar with the  language,  culture,
       religion and societal  norms  of  Pakistan,  having  grown  up  in  a
       Pakistani family and within the Pakistani  community  in  Dubai.  She
       also has maintained a connection with extended  family  in  Pakistan,
       including family members whose address she has used for her  identity
       card and with whom  she  has  stayed  on  family  visits.  Given  her
       background  and  family  connections,  we  are  satisfied  that   the
       appellant would be an insider in Pakistan,  in  the  sense  that  she
       would have an understanding as to how life  is  carried  on  and  the
       ability to integrate and be accepted. The difficulties and challenges
       she would face integrating fall a  long  way  short  of  being  "very
       significant obstacles".

   77.  It was not argued before us that the assessment of very  significant
       obstacles under para. 276ADE(1)(vi)  should  take  into  account  the
       length of time the appellant would be outside of the UK.  It  is  not
       necessary for us to consider this issue - and therefore we do not  do
       so - because, on the facts of this appeal, there would  not  be  very
       significant  obstacles  to  integration  in  Pakistan   whether   the
       appellant remained there permanently or for a short period.




  Public  interest  and  proportionality  of  removing  the  appellant   in
  circumstances where she will be granted entry clearance to  re-enter  the
  UK within several months of her removal ('the Chikwamba principle')

   78. The appellant, relying on what has been referred to by the parties as
       the Chikwamba principle, argues that (a) there is no public  interest
       in requiring her to leave the UK merely in order to make a successful
       application for entry clearance; and (b)  because there is no  public
       interest in her removal  it  is  not  necessary  for  her  show  that
       temporary separation would be disproportionate or would give rise  to
       any kind of unusual hardship.

   79. To support these contentions, the appellant relies on a  passage  (at
       para. 44) in Chikwamba v SSHD [2008] UKHL 40 where Lord Brown stated:

           "[I]t seems to me that only comparatively rarely,  certainly  in
           family cases involving children, should an article 8  appeal  be
           dismissed on the basis that it would be proportionate  and  more
           appropriate for the appellant to apply for leave from abroad."

   80. This is said to be reinforced by R (Agyarko) v SSHD [2017]  UKSC  11,
       where Lord Reed stated at para. 51 that:

           "Whether the applicant is in the UK unlawfully, or  is  entitled
           to remain in the UK only temporarily, however, the  significance
           of this consideration depends on what the outcome of immigration
           control might otherwise be. For example, if an  applicant  would
           otherwise be automatically deported as a foreign criminal,  then
           the weight of the public interest in his  or  her  removal  will
           generally be very  considerable.  If,  on  the  other  hand,  an
           applicant-even if residing in the  UK  unlawfully-was  otherwise
           certain to be granted leave to enter, at least if an application
           were made from outside the UK, then there  might  be  no  public
           interest in his or her removal. The point is illustrated by  the
           decision  in  Chikwamba  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
           Department." (Emphasis added).

   81. Mr Lindsay argued in response that there is a public interest in  the
       appellant's  (temporary)  removal  from  the  UK.  He  described  the
       applicable public interests as being the maintenance of an  effective
       system of immigration control, the promotion of public confidence  in
       the immigration system, and deterrence  of  others  from  seeking  to
       enter or remain without appropriate leave.

   82. In addition, he argued that  it  was  for  the  appellant  to  submit
       evidence to show that temporary removal would be disproportionate and
       she had not demonstrated that the nature and extent of any disruption
       to her family life would interfere disproportionately with her rights
       under article 8.

   83. Neither Chikwamba nor  Agyarko  support  the  contention  that  there
       cannot be a public interest in removing a  person  from  the  UK  who
       would succeed in an entry clearance application. In Agyarko,  a  case
       in which the Chikwamba principle was not at issue, it  is  only  said
       that that there "might" be no public interest in the removal of  such
       a person.

   84. The appellant in Chikwamba was a failed asylum seeker  from  Zimbabwe
       whose  removal  was  temporarily  suspended  because  of  the   harsh
       conditions in Zimbabwe. Whilst in the UK she married  a  national  of
       Zimbabwe who had been granted asylum and they had a daughter. Shortly
       after her daughter was born, the suspension on removals  to  Zimbabwe
       was lifted. It was accepted that the appellant would succeed were she
       to make an application for entry  clearance  from  Zimbabwe  but  the
       respondent's policy nonetheless required  her  removal.  Lord  Brown,
       allowing the appellant's appeal, concluded at paragraph 46:

           "Is it really to be  said  that  effective  immigration  control
           requires that the claimant and her child must first travel  back
           (perhaps at the taxpayers' expense) to Zimbabwe,  a  country  to
           which the enforced return  of  failed  asylum  seekers  remained
           suspended for more than two years after the claimant's  marriage
           and where conditions are 'harsh  and  unpalatable',  and  remain
           there for some months obtaining entry clearance, before  finally
           she can return (at her own expense) to  the  United  Kingdom  to
           resume her family life which meantime  will  have  been  gravely
           disrupted? Surely one has only to ask the question to  recognise
           the right answer."

   85. If, as the appellant claims, the  principle  of  Chikwamba  is  that,
       irrespective of individual circumstances, there is no public interest
       in requiring a person to leave the UK  simply  in  order  to  make  a
       successful application  for  entry  clearance,  then  the  individual
       circumstances  of  an  appellant  (including  issues  such   as   the
       difficulties they might face on return) would be irrelevant.  All  an
       appellant would need to show is that he or she would succeed  in  the
       application from abroad as that would be sufficient to establish that
       there is no public interest in  removal  (and  therefore  removal  is
       disproportionate).  The  difficulty  with  this   interpretation   of
       Chikwamba is that it does not explain why Lord  Brown  engaged  in  a
       detailed consideration of the individual and particular circumstances
       of the appellant (specifically, that the conditions in Zimbabwe  were
       "harsh and unpalatable", her husband could not accompany her and  she
       would need to bring to Zimbabwe - or be separated from - her  child).
       These factors, which form part of Lord Brown's reasoning  to  support
       his  conclusion  that  there  was  not  a  public  interest  in   the
       appellant's removal, would have been irrelevant if all that  mattered
       was that the appellant would be granted entry clearance.

   86. The appellant's interpretation of Chikwamba also ignores the analysis
       of Lord Brown at paragraphs 41-42 where he made clear  that  in  some
       cases there will be a public interest in removing (and it will not be
       disproportionate to remove) a person from the  UK  even  though  they
       will be granted entry clearance when applying from abroad.  He  noted
       that the appellant in R (Ekinci) v SSHD [2003] EWCA Civ 79 (a  person
       with an appalling immigration history who would only be  required  to
       travel to Germany for one month for a decision  on  his  application)
       was such a person. In addition, he  identified  factors  relevant  to
       both  whether  there  is  public  interest  in  removal  (a  person's
       immigration  history)  and  whether  temporary   removal   would   be
       disproportionate  (the  prospective  length  and  degree  of   family
       disruption,  and  the  circumstances  in  the  country  of  temporary
       return).

   87. The Court of Appeal, when interpreting Chikwamba, has been clear that
       the case does not stand for the proposition that it is sufficient, in
       order to resist removal under article 8 ECHR,  for  an  appellant  to
       show that he or she would succeed in an entry clearance  application.
       In Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  v  Hayat  (Pakistan)
       [2012] EWCA Civ 1054, for example, the Court of Appeal upheld a First-
       tier Tribunal decision that  removal  would  be  proportionate,  even
       though an entry clearance application would succeed. Elias  LJ  found
       at para. 52 that the individual  circumstances  of  the  case  (where
       separation would be short, family life could continue outside the UK,
       the appellant had no legitimate expectation of a right to remain, and
       the consequences of separation would be far less serious than that in
       Chikwamba) were such that "there were cogent factors  justifying  the
       conclusion  that  Article  8  was  not  infringed  by  requiring  the
       appellant to return to Pakistan."

   88. Mr Lindsay drew our attention  to  a  more  recent  Court  of  Appeal
       judgment in which the Chikwamba principle was considered: Kaur, R (on
       the application of) v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home  Department
       [2018] EWCA Civ 1423. The appellant's argument raising the  Chikwamba
       principle was not ultimately decided by the Court but the  nature  of
       the principle was discussed. Holroyde LJ  noted  that  the  facts  in
       Chikwamba were "stark". At paragraph 45 he stated:

           "I have quoted in paragraph 26 above the passage in  which  Lord
           Reed (at paragraph 51 of his judgment in  Agyarko)  referred  to
           Chikwamba. It is relevant to note that  he  there  spoke  of  an
           applicant who was "certain to be granted leave to enter"  if  an
           application were made from outside the UK, and said that in such
           a case there  might  be  no  public  interest  in  removing  the
           applicant. That, in my view, is  a  clear  indication  that  the
           Chikwamba principle will require a fact-specific  assessment  in
           each case, will only apply in a very clear case, and  even  then
           will not necessarily result in a grant of leave to remain."

   89. The Upper Tribunal considered the Chikwamba principle in  R  (on  the
       application of Chen) v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department)
       (Appendix FM - Chikwamba - temporary  separation  -  proportionality)
       IJR [2015] UKUT 00189 (IAC). Upper Tribunal Gill observed  that  Lord
       Brown was not laying down a legal test when he suggested in Chikwamba
       that requiring a claimant to make an application for entry  clearance
       would  only  "comparatively  rarely"  be  proportionate  in  a   case
       involving children, and  that  in  all  cases  it  will  be  for  the
       individual to demonstrate, through evidence, and based on his or  her
       individual   circumstances,   that   temporary   removal   would   be
       disproportionate.

   90. Chikwamba pre-dates Part 5A of the Nationality Immigration and Asylum
       Act 2002 ("the 2002 Act"), which was inserted by the Immigration  Act
       2014. Section 117A(2) of the  2002  Act  provides  that  a  court  or
       tribunal, when considering "the public interest question," must  have
       regard to the considerations listed in  section  117B  (and  117C  in
       cases concerning the deportation of foreign criminals, which  is  not
       relevant to this appeal). The "public interest question"  is  defined
       as "the question of whether an interference with a person's right  to
       respect for private and family life is justified under article 8(2)".
        There is no exception in Part 5A of the 2002 Act (or elsewhere)  for
       cases in which an appellant, following removal, will  succeed  in  an
       application for entry clearance.  Accordingly,  an  appellant  in  an
       Article 8 human rights appeal who argues  that  there  is  no  public
       interest in removal because after leaving the UK he or  she  will  be
       granted entry clearance must, in  all  cases,  address  the  relevant
       considerations in Part 5A of the 2002 Act including section  117B(1),
       which stipulates  that  "the  maintenance  of  effective  immigration
       controls is in the public interest". Reliance on Chikwamba  does  not
       obviate the need to do this.

   91. In the light of the foregoing analysis, we approach  the  appellant's
       Chikwamba argument as follows.

   92. The first question to be addressed is whether her  temporary  removal
       from the UK is a sufficient interference with her (and her  family's)
       family life to even engage article  8(1).  If  article  8(1)  is  not
       engaged then the proportionality of removal under article 8(2) -  and
       therefore the Chikwamba principle - does not arise.

   93. We did not hear argument on this point and both parties proceeded  on
       the basis that article 8 is engaged. In this case, where one  of  the
       consequences of  temporary  removal  will  be  that  the  appellant's
       daughter is separated from her father for several months, we  are  in
       no doubt that article 8(1)  is  engaged.  However,  even  though  the
       threshold to engage article 8(1) is not high (see AG (Eritrea) [2007]
       EWCA Civ 801 and KD (Sri Lanka) [2007] EWCA  Civ  1384),  it  is  not
       difficult to envisage cases (for example, where there would not be  a
       significant impediment to an  appellant's  partner  accompanying  the
       appellant to his or her country for a short period) in which  article
       8 would not be engaged.

   94. The second question is whether an  application  for  entry  clearance
       from abroad will be granted. If the appellant  will  not  be  granted
       entry clearance the Chikwamba principle is not relevant.  A  tribunal
       must determine this for itself based on the evidence before  it,  the
       burden being on the appellant: see Chen at 39. In this case, we  have
       found, for the reasons explained  above,  that,  on  the  balance  of
       probabilities, the appellant will be granted entry clearance  if  she
       makes an application from Pakistan to join her partner.

   95. The third question is whether there  is  a  public  interest  in  the
       appellant being required to leave the UK in order  to  undertake  the
       step of applying for entry clearance; and  if  so,  how  much  weight
       should be attached to that public interest.

   96. In some cases, the fact that a person will be able to re-enter the UK
       means that there will be no public interest at  all  in  his  or  her
       removal. By way of example, in Parveen v The Secretary of  State  for
       the Home Department [2018] EWCA Civ 932 the appellant had entered the
       country lawfully and genuinely on a  spouse  visa  and  had  remained
       married to her husband and resident in the UK ever since but had not,
       thirteen years earlier, made an application for leave.  Underhill  LJ
       observed at para. 28:

           "It is hard to see how it could be right to insist on the  empty
           but disruptive formality of leaving  the  country  in  order  to
           correct  a  venial  administrative  error  made  thirteen  years
           previously".

   97. If there is no public interest in a person's removal then it will  be
       disproportionate for him or her to be removed and no further analysis
       under Article 8 is required. On the other hand, if there is at  least
       some degree of public interest in a person being temporarily  removed
       then it will be necessary to evaluate how much weight is to be  given
       to that public interest  so  that  this  can  be  factored  into  the
       proportionality assessment under article 8(2).

   98. We have found that the appellant (a) entered the UK as a visitor even
       though her real intention was to remain in the UK with  her  partner;
       and (b) remained in the UK despite stating in  the  2016  application
       that she would leave after 6 months. We agree with Mr  Lindsay  that,
       in the light of this immigration history, the public interest in  the
       appellant's removal from the UK is strong; and the strength  of  that
       public interest is not significantly diminished because she  will  be
       able  to  re-enter  the  UK.  The  integrity  of,  and  the  public's
       confidence in, the U.K.'s  immigration  system  is  undermined  if  a
       person is able to circumvent it, as the appellant has attempted to do
       by entering the UK as a  visitor  with  the  intention  of  remaining
       permanently. Requiring the  appellant,  in  these  circumstances,  to
       leave the UK in order to make a valid entry clearance application  as
       a partner, far from being merely a disruptive formality,  serves  the
       important public interest of the maintenance of effective immigration
       controls.

   99. The fourth question is whether the interference with the  appellant's
       (and her family's) right to respect for their private and family life
       arising from her being required to  leave  the  UK  for  a  temporary
       period  is  justified   under   article   8(2).   This   requires   a
       proportionality  evaluation  (i.e.  a  balance  of  public   interest
       factors) where consideration is given to all material  considerations
       including (in particular) those enumerated in  section  117B  of  the
       2002 Act.

  100. The evidence before the Tribunal  indicates  that  temporary  removal
       will result in a substantial interference with the appellant's family
       life. Most significantly, the appellant's daughter will be  separated
       from her father (who will not be able to accompany her because of his
       work commitments and  responsibilities  for  his  sons)  for  several
       months. In  addition,  the  appellant  will  be  separated  from  her
       partner, and  will  have  to  reside  in  a  country  she  has  never
       previously lived in. That said, there is no reason the appellant will
       not be able to live comfortably (her partner  can  provide  her  with
       financial support during her temporary period outside of the UK)  and
       she will be living in a culture with which she  is  familiar  and  in
       proximity to extended family.

  101. A primary, but not determinative, consideration is the best interests
       of the appellant's daughter. It is not in the child's best  interests
       to be separated from father,  or  from  her  step-brothers.  Although
       removal will be temporary, we have found that it may  take  up  to  9
       months for the appellant to be in a  position  to  re-enter  the  UK,
       which is a substantial period of time for a young child. On the other
       hand, the child is healthy, and because of her young age  there  will
       not be any significant disruption to her education (she is in nursery
       and has not yet started school). In  addition,  she  would  have  the
       benefit  of  experiencing  life  in  the  country  of  her   mother's
       nationality. Weighing these factors, whilst we consider that it would
       be in the child's best interests to not have to relocate to  Pakistan
       without her father, we are equally of the  view  that  she  will  not
       suffer any detriment by doing so, given the temporary nature  of  the
       separation.

  102. We apply the considerations in section 117B as follows:

        a. Section 117B(1)  provides  that  the  maintenance  of  effective
           immigration controls is in the public interest. For the  reasons
           we have set out above, this factor weighs heavily in  favour  of
           removal.

        b. Following Rhuppiah v SSHD [2018] UKSC 58 at para. 57,  we  treat
           sections  117B(2)  (ability  to  speak  English)   and   117B(3)
           (financial independence) as neutral factors, as the  appellant's
           partner earns a sufficient income for the family  to  not  be  a
           burden on the state and, although  we  were  not  provided  with
           evidence on this point and the appellant gave  evidence  through
           an interpreter, we  are  prepared  to  accept  that  she  speaks
           English.

        c. Section 117B(4) is not applicable because the appellant has  not
           been in the UK unlawfully.

        d. Section 117B(5) (little weight to  a  private  life  established
           when a person's immigration status is precarious) does not apply
           to the appellant's relationship with her partner because (a) the
           relationship engages her family, rather than private, life;  and
           (b) it was established before she came to the UK; ie  not  at  a
           time when her immigration status was precarious.

        e. Section 117B(6) (no public interest in removal  where  it  would
           not be reasonable to expect a qualifying child to leave the UK )
           does not apply because, for the reasons set out below, we reject
           the argument that it is not reasonable to expect the appellant's
           child to leave the UK.

  103. Adopting the balance sheet approach recommended  by  Lord  Thomas  in
       Hesham Ali (Iraq) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016]
       UKSC 60 we find as follows.

  104. Weighing on the appellant's side of the balance sheet is that:

        a. The appellant's daughter will be separated from her father  (and
           the appellant from her partner) for up to 9 months.  This  is  a
           substantial period of time, particularly for the daughter.

        b. It is in the best  interests  of  the  appellant's  daughter  to
           remain in the UK  with  both  parents  rather  than  temporarily
           reside in Pakistan with just the appellant.

        c. The appellant will face some challenges setting herself  up  and
           organising her life in Pakistan, given that she  has  not  lived
           there previously.

  105. Weighing on the other side of the balance sheet is that  even  though
       the appellant's removal will be followed by her re-entry,  there  is,
       for the reasons explained above, nonetheless a strong public interest
       in her being required to leave the UK in order  to  comply  with  the
       requirement to obtain valid entry clearance as a partner.

  106. Balancing the factors weighing for  and  against  the  appellant,  we
       reach the firm conclusion that her removal, in order to make an entry
       clearance application from Pakistan, is proportionate.

  Section 117B(6) of the Nationality Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  and
  the reasonableness of expecting the appellant's daughter to leave the UK

  107. Section 117B(6) of the 2002 Act provides that:

           '(6)   In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation,
           the public interest does not require the person's removal where-

                 a)  the  person  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
                    relationship with a qualifying child, and

                 b) it would not be reasonable to expect the child to  leave
                    the United Kingdom.'

  108. Section 117B(6) of the 2002 Act is a self-contained  provision,  such
       that where the conditions specified therein are satisfied the  public
       interest does not require the person's removal. See MA  (Pakistan)  &
       Ors v Upper Tribunal [2016] EWCA Civ 705.

  109. The respondent accepts that the  appellant  meets  the  condition  in
       117B(6)(a).  The  respondent  also  accepts  that  it  would  not  be
       reasonable to  expect  the  appellant's  daughter  to  leave  the  UK
       indefinitely. However, the respondent argues that  the  condition  in
       section 117B(6)(b) is not met  because  it  would  be  reasonable  to
       expect the appellant's daughter to leave the  UK  temporarily  whilst
       her mother makes an application for entry clearance from Pakistan.

  110. Section 117B(6)(b) requires a court or tribunal to  assume  that  the
       child in question will leave the UK: Secretary of State for the  Home
       Department v AB (Jamaica) & Anor  [2019]  EWCA  Civ  661  and  JG  (s
       117B(6): "reasonable to leave" UK) Turkey [2019]  UKUT  00072  (IAC).
       However, once that assumption has been made, the  court  or  tribunal
       must move from the hypothetical to  the  real:  paragraph  19  of  KO
       (Nigeria) & Ors v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2018]
       UKSC 53. The length of time a child is likely to be outside the UK is
       part of the real world factual circumstances in which  a  child  will
       find herself and is relevant to deciding, for the purpose of  section
       117B(6)(b), whether it would be unreasonable to expect the  child  to
       leave the UK.

  111. A court or tribunal must base its analysis of reasonableness  on  the
       facts as they are (having assumed, for the purpose of this  analysis,
       that the child will leave the UK with his or her parent or  parents).
       The  "real  world"  context  includes  consideration  of   everything
       relating to the child, both in the UK and country of return, such  as
       whether he or she will be leaving  the  UK  with  both  or  just  one
       parent; how removal will affect his or  her  education,  health,  and
       relationships with family and friends;  and  the  conditions  in  the
       country of return. The conduct and immigration history of the child's
       parent(s), however, is not relevant. See KO at paras. 16 - 18.

  112. The "real world" circumstances  in  the  country  of  return  may  be
       significantly different if a  child  will  be  outside  the  UK  only
       temporarily rather than indefinitely. For example, when a child  will
       be leaving the UK  indefinitely  the  availability  and  adequacy  of
       education in the destination country  might  be  highly  relevant  to
       whether it is a reasonable to expect the child to  relocate  to  that
       country. On the other hand, if the child will be leaving the  UK  for
       only a few months, it is the disruption to his or  her  education  in
       the UK that is likely to be more significant than the availability of
       suitable education in the country of return.

  113. Both parties agreed that the length of time a child will  be  outside
       the UK is part of the real world factual  circumstances  in  which  a
       child will find herself and we were not presented  with  (and  cannot
       conceive of) any good  reason  why  this  should  not  be  the  case.
       Accordingly, whether it would be reasonable to expect the appellant's
       daughter to leave the UK is to  be  assessed  on  the  basis  of  our
       finding of fact that she will be outside the UK, with the  appellant,
       for 4 - 9 months.

  114. Mr Sarwar argued that it  would  not  be  reasonable  to  expect  the
       appellant's daughter to leave the UK for even a short period  because
       she would be without her father and step-siblings; would be unable to
       access the UK education and health system, and would  face  emotional
       turmoil from being uprooted. In addition, he submitted that she would
       face a challenging environment in Pakistan because the appellant  has
       never lived there and would not have  family  or  other  support.  Mr
       Sarwar relied on the respondent's policy as set out in  the  document
       titled Family Policy: family life (as a partner or  parent),  private
       life and exceptional  circumstances  dated  10  December  2019  which
       states at page 50 that the respondent "would not  normally  expect  a
       qualifying child to leave the UK".

  115. Mr Lindsay argued that it is not  unreasonable  for  the  appellant's
       daughter to be separated from her father and step siblings for only a
       short period and that there would not be a significant disruption  to
       her education (as she has  not  yet  started  school)  or  healthcare
       provision (as the evidence is that she is healthy). He also submitted
       that the circumstances in  Pakistan  would  not  be  harsh;  and  the
       appellant's daughter would be with her primary carer, in the  country
       of her mother's nationality where extended family live.

  116. We do not accept Mr Sarwar's contention that the appellant's daughter
       will face emotional turmoil as a result of spending up to nine months
       in Pakistan. She is a young child who will be with her mother (who is
       her primary carer)  in  the  country  of  her  mother's  citizenship.
       Although the appellant has not lived in  Pakistan,  she  is  familiar
       with the  culture,  environment,  societal  norms  and  has  extended
       family. The evidence does not  indicate  that  Pakistan  would  be  a
       difficult or harsh environment for the appellant's child. She has not
       yet started school, so there will be no disruption to her  education.
       Nor is there a reason to believe that spending a period  of  time  in
       Pakistan will be detrimental to her health as there  is  no  evidence
       before us that she has any medical problems.

  117. The appellant's daughter will be separated from her father  and  step
       siblings. However, the separation  will  only  be  temporary,  during
       which time she will be able to remain in contact  with  them  through
       telephone, skype and other means of  communication  (and  her  father
       could visit her). As we have explained above, whilst we consider that
       it would be in her best interests to not have to relocate to Pakistan
       without her father, we are equally of the  view  that  she  will  not
       suffer any detriment by doing  so,  given   her  young  age  and  the
       temporary nature of the separation. Although  the  daughter  will  be
       temporarily removed from nursery school,  there  is  no  evidence  to
       justify the conclusion that this will  have  any  materially  adverse
       effect on her education and general development. Taking all of  these
       factors into consideration, we are satisfied that  it  would  not  be
       unreasonable to expect the appellant's daughter to leave the UK for a
       temporary period whilst her mother applies for entry clearance.

  The principle in Ruiz Zambrano v Office national  de  l'emploi  (Case  C-
  34/09) and the appellant's entitlement to a right of residence  to  avoid
  her daughter being deprived of the genuine enjoyment of the substance  of
  her European Union citizenship rights

  118. Article 20 of the Treaty on the Functioning  of  the  European  Union
       ("TFEU")  precludes  national  measures  which  have  the  effect  of
       depriving citizens of the European Union of the genuine enjoyment  of
       the substance of the rights conferred by virtue of  their  status  as
       citizens of the Union. This was applied in Zambrano to  mean  that  a
       parent of a child who is a British  citizen  (and  therefore  also  a
       European Union citizen)  is  entitled  to  a  (derivative)  right  of
       residence to avoid the child being compelled to leave  the  territory
       of the European Union as a result of his or her parent being required
       to leave.

  119. The scope of the concept of "being compelled" to leave  the  European
       Union was recently  considered  by  the  Supreme  Court  in  Patel  v
       Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department  [2019]  UKSC  59.  At
       paragraph 30 Lady Arden stated:

           "The overarching question is whether the son would be  compelled
           to leave by reason of his relationship of  dependency  with  his
           father. In answering that question, the  court  is  required  to
           take account, "in the best interests of the child concerned,  of
           all the specific circumstances, including the age of the  child,
           the child's physical and emotional development,  the  extent  of
           his emotional ties both to the Union citizen parent and  to  the
           third-country national parent, and the  risks  which  separation
           from the latter  might  entail  for  that  child's  equilibrium"
           (Chavez-Vilchez, para 71). The test  of  compulsion  is  thus  a
           practical test to be applied to the actual facts and  not  to  a
           theoretical set of facts.  As  explained  in  para  28  of  this
           judgment, on the FTT's findings, the son would be  compelled  to
           leave with his father, who  was  his  primary  carer.  That  was
           sufficient compulsion for the purposes  of  the  Zambrano  test.
           There  is  an  obvious  difference  between  this  situation  of
           compulsion on the child and impermissible reliance on the  right
           to respect for family life or on the desirability of keeping the
           family together as a ground for obtaining a derivative residence
           card. It follows that the Court of Appeal was wrong in this case
           to bring the question of the mother's choice into the assessment
           of compulsion." (Emphasis added).

  120. The appellant and her partner could  choose  for  their  daughter  to
       remain in the UK with her father whilst the appellant leaves the  UK.
       The Court of Appeal in Patel found  that  the  existence  of  such  a
       choice meant that there was no question of compulsion: see  para.  75
       of Patel v SSHD [2017] EWCA Civ 2028.  The  Supreme  Court,  however,
       concluded to the contrary, finding that there is compulsion, for  the
       purposes of the Zambrano test, where, in practice and  based  on  the
       actual facts, the child will in  fact  leave  the  territory  of  the
       Union.

  121. We have found, as a fact, that the appellant is the primary carer  of
       her daughter and that if she is required to leave  the  UK  she  will
       take her daughter with her. Accordingly, applying the  interpretation
       of the Zambrano test in Patel, we find that the appellant's  daughter
       will be compelled to leave the UK as a result of her  mother  leaving
       the UK.

  122. In Zambrano, as well as the subsequent CJEU  cases  interpreting  and
       developing the derivative right of residence described  therein,  the
       children in question faced indefinite exclusion from the territory of
       the Union. In these cases, it followed  inextricably  (and  therefore
       was not in dispute) that the children, if compelled to leave the  UK,
       would be deprived of the genuine enjoyment of the substance of  Union
       citizenship rights protected by Article 20 TFEU.

  123. However, in this appeal, in contrast, the appellant and her  daughter
       will be outside the Union (in Pakistan) for only a  temporary  period
       (of up to 9 months).  Whilst in  Pakistan  the  appellant's  daughter
       will be deprived of the enjoyment  of  the  substance  of  her  Union
       citizenship rights. The deprivation she will face, however,  is  only
       theoretical because if  she  were  to  remain  in  the  UK  for  this
       temporary period it is extremely unlikely  that,  as  a  young  child
       attending nursery, she would engage in any activities (such as moving
       within the Union) where her  rights  as  a  Union  citizen  would  be
       relevant. The question to resolve, therefore, is whether it is enough
       that she will be temporarily deprived of the genuine enjoyment of her
       rights as a citizen of the Union in a theoretical sense.

  124. As far as we are aware this question has not been considered  in  any
       European or UK cases. However, in Patel,  the  Supreme  Court,  after
       considering the CJEU's Zambrano  jurisprudence,  concluded  that  the
       test of compulsion is "a practical test to be applied to  the  actual
       facts and not  to  a  theoretical  set  of  facts".  Given  that  the
       assessment of whether a child will be compelled to  leave  the  Union
       for the purposes of Article 20 TFEU must be based on the actual facts
       (rather than any hypothetical or theoretical scenarios),  it  follows
       that the assessment  of  whether  a  child,  as  a  result  of  being
       compelled to leave the territory of  the  European  Union,  will   be
       deprived of his or her genuine enjoyment of the rights  conferred  by
       Article 20 TFEU in accordance with Zambrano falls to be  assessed  by
       considering the actual facts (including how long a child is likely to
       be outside the territory  of  the  Union),  rather  than  theoretical
       possibilities.

  125. Accordingly, we find that it is not  contrary  to  the  principle  in
       Zambrano for the appellant's daughter to be compelled to leave the UK
       with the appellant because she and the appellant will re-enter the UK
       several months later and any loss of enjoyment of  the  substance  of
       her Union citizenship rights (which will be limited to that temporary
       period) will only be theoretical.
