For the Appellant:     Miss Smith, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr G Harrison, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 28th February 1987.  The
    Appellant had applied on 24th December 2013 for leave to remain in  the
    United Kingdom as the spouse of Muhammad Awan.   That  application  was
    refused by the Secretary of State on 25th February 2014.  The Appellant
    appealed and the appeal came before Immigration Judge  Ransley  sitting
    in Manchester on 12th August 2014.  In a determination  promulgated  on
    20th August 2014 the Appellant's appeal was dismissed  both  under  the
    Immigration Rules and on human rights grounds.

 2. On 3rd September 2014 the Appellant lodged Grounds  of  Appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal.  On 6th October  2014  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Cox
    noted that the judge's findings were unchallenged as to what he  called
    the devious conduct of the Appellant and Sponsor husband vis ï¿½ vis  the
    UK immigration  regime  and  the  unsurprising  conclusion  that  Judge
    Ransley took a robust view on the proportionality issue.   Nevertheless
    Judge Cox acknowledged that the Appellant and her husband had a British
    citizen child and raised an important and arguable issue  by  reference
    to Section 117B(6) of Part 5A of the 2002 Act brought into force by the
    Immigration Act of 2014 along with the authority of Sanade.

 3. On 16th October 2014 the Secretary of State responded to the Grounds of
    Appeal under Rule 24.  That response noted that  whilst  the  Appellant
    may be in  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental  relationship  with  a
    qualifying child where it would not be reasonable to expect that  child
    to have to leave the UK but that is not a determining factor  and  that
    there are many other factors under Section 117B which are also relevant
    when  considering  the  public   interest   in   particular   financial
    independence.  The response contended that the fact that the  Appellant
    has a British citizen child did not mean that the public  interest  was
    overridden.

 4. On that basis the matter came first before me on 16th December 2014 for
    the specific purpose of determining whether or not  there  had  been  a
    material error of law.  At that hearing a letter had been lodged by the
    Appellant's previously instructed solicitors indicating that it was not
    their  intention  to  attend  the  hearing.   The  Appellant   appeared
    considerably distressed by this and indicated she had no idea why  they
    were not present.  In such circumstances I granted  an  adjournment  to
    enable the solicitors to advise why they were not  in  attendance,  and
    for the Appellant to obtain representation.

 5. It is on that basis that the appeal now comes back before  me.   It  is
    disappointing  to  note  that  the  Appellant's  previously  instructed
    solicitors Khirri of West Bromwich have completely ignored the  court's
    direction to provide an  explanation  for  their  previous  failure  to
    attend.  The Appellant now  appears  by  her  instructed  Counsel  Miss
    Smith, Miss Smith attending pursuant to the provisions of direct access
    to the bar.

Submissions/Discussions

 6. Miss Smith submits that there  is  a  material  error  of  law  in  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge in her  analysis  of  Section
    117B(6) of the Immigration Rules and the judge's failure to follow  the
    authority of Sanade and Others (British children - Zambrano  -  Dereci)
    [2012] UKUT 00048 (IAC).  She points out that this is not a deportation
    case and the Secretary of State accepts that the conditions therein are
    satisfied.  This is a case where the judge has failed  to  address  the
    appropriate issues and that there is consequently a material  error  of
    law that I should set aside the decision and remake it in favour of the
    Appellant.

 7. In response Mr Harrison indicates that it is  not  as  simple  as  that
    because of the fact that paragraphs 117B(6)(a) and (b)  are  joined  by
    the word "and".  Miss Smith responds that Sanade is a complete response
    to that submission.  Mr Harrison points out that it is not the position
    of the Secretary of State that they are requiring the  child  to  leave
    the country merely the Appellant and that the First-tier Tribunal Judge
    noted that the Appellant and her husband were  involved  in  a  factual
    account which the judge found  untruthful.   He  points  out  that  the
    child's father who is in the UK is a British citizen and that  this  is
    not a Chikwamba situation where if the mother was required to leave she
    would automatically get back in bearing in mind the financial  position
    of the parties.  He does no more than make these submissions and leaves
    it to the court to determine the issues further.

The Law

 8.  Areas  of  legislative  interpretation,  failure  to  follow   binding
    authority or to distinguish it with adequate reasons, ignoring material
    considerations  by  taking  into  account  immaterial   considerations,
    reaching irrational conclusions  on  fact  or  evaluation  or  to  give
    legally inadequate reasons for the decision and procedural  unfairness,
    constitute errors of law.

 9. It is not an arguable error of law for an Immigration Judge to give too
    little weight or too much weight to a factor, unless  irrationality  is
    alleged.  Nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge to fail to
    deal with every  factual  issue  of  argument.   Disagreement  with  an
    Immigration Judge's factual conclusion, his appraisal of  the  evidence
    or assessment of credibility, or his evaluation of risk does  not  give
    rise to an error of law.  Unless an Immigration Judge's  assessment  of
    proportionality is arguable as being  completely  wrong,  there  is  no
    error of law, nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge not to
    have regard to evidence of events arising after his decision or for him
    to have taken  no  account  of  evidence  which  was  not  before  him.
    Rationality is a very high threshold and a conclusion is not irrational
    just because some alternative explanation has been rejected or  can  be
    said to be possible.  Nor is it necessary to  consider  every  possible
    alternative  inference  consistent   with   truthfulness   because   an
    Immigration Judge concludes that the story is untrue.  If  a  point  of
    evidence of significance has been ignored or misunderstood, that  is  a
    failure to take into account a material consideration.

The Relevant Statute and Case Law

10. It would be helpful within this determination to set out  the  relevant
    statutory authority and case guidance upon which  the  submissions  are
    made.  Section 117B(6) to the Immigration Rules states:

         (6)  In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation,  the
             public interest does not require the person's removal where-

             (a)   the  person  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting   parental
                  relationship with a qualifying child, and

             (b)  it would not be reasonable to expect the child  to  leave
                  the United Kingdom.

11. Sanade and Others (British children - Zambrano -  Dereci)  [2012]  UKUT
    0048 (IAC) is authoritative guidance extending the principles  set  out
    in Zambrano.  Zambrano makes it clear that where the  child  or  indeed
    the remaining spouse is a British citizen and therefore  a  citizen  of
    the European Union, as a matter of EU law it is not possible to require
    the family as a unit to relocate outside of the European Union  or  for
    the Secretary of State to submit that it would be reasonable  for  them
    to do so.  Where in the context of Article 8 one parent  of  a  British
    citizen child is also a British citizen the removal of the other parent
    does not mean that either the child or the  remaining  parent  will  be
    required to leave  thereby  infringing  the  Zambrano  principle.   The
    critical question is whether the child is dependent on the parent being
    removed for the exercise of his Union right of  residence  and  whether
    removal of that parent will deprive the child of the effective exercise
    of residence in the United Kingdom or elsewhere in the Union.

Findings

12. The submissions put forward by Miss Smith are persuasive.  The judge at
    first instance has at paragraph 51 and 52 failed to take  into  account
    provisions in Sanade and the law as it now stands  applying  both  that
    authority and Section 117B.  I am not persuaded by the submissions made
    by Mr Harrison although I acknowledge that  this  is  not  a  Chikwamba
    situation.  There is consequently an error of law in  the  decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge.  I set aside the decision.

The Remaking of the Decision

13. I again heard further submissions from both legal  representatives.   I
    am satisfied that the Appellant must succeed in her appeal despite  the
    concerns expressed by the First-tier Tribunal Judge as to her  account.
    Paragraph 95 of Sanade is good law.  It states that where  a  child  or
    indeed the remaining spouse  is  a  British  citizen  and  therefore  a
    citizen of the European Union it is not possible  to  require  them  to
    relocate outside of the European Union  or  submit  that  it  would  be
    reasonable for them to do so.  Consequently in  this  case  it  is  not
    reasonable nor is it in any way expected  that  the  Appellant's  child
    should leave the UK.  However we are dealing with a child who is 1 year
    old.  It is not  reasonable  in  such  circumstances  to  separate  the
    Appellant from her child.  I acknowledge that there is a father who  is
    a British citizen but I do not consider it reasonable or appropriate to
    separate the child from  his  mother.   On  that  basis  following  the
    principles in Sanade the Appellant's appeal must succeed.

14. It is further appropriate to briefly address the issue under  paragraph
    117B(6).  That paragraph would appear to apply in this instant case and
    it postdates Sanade.  This  Appellant  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    parental  relationship  with  a  qualifying  child  so   the   question
    consequently arises due to the use of the word "and" linking (a) to (b)
    as to whether it would be reasonable to expect the child to  leave  the
    United Kingdom in these  circumstances.   For  all  the  above  reasons
    particularly bearing in mind the protection given to the  child  by  EU
    law as confirmed in Sanade, the  age  of  the  child  and  thereby  the
    relationship of the child to  her  mother  it  would  not  in  all  the
    circumstances of this matter be reasonable  to  expect  her  to  leave.
    This is a matter to  which  I  have  to  give  due  consideration  when
    applying  117B  when  taking   into   account   the   public   interest
    considerations.   In  such  circumstances  the  Appellant's  appeal  is
    allowed under the Immigration Rules.

and is set aside.  The decision is remade allowing  the  Appellant's  appeal
under the Immigration Rules.
