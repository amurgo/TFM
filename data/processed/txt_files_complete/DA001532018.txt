Representation:

For the Appellant:     Miss A Everett, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Z Malik, instructed by Iras & Co, Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State appeals with permission against the decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge M B Hussain promulgated on 4 September  2018,
    allowing Mr [L]'s appeal against a decision made on 19 February 2018 to
    deport him. I refer to Mr [L] as the appellant as  he  was  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of France born on 7 August 1976.  He entered
    the United Kingdom in, it is said, 2000 and worked as  a  self-employed
    barber.  On 14 June 2005 the  appellant  was  convicted  upon  his  own
    guilty plea to a conspiracy  to  defraud,  that  fraud  being  directed
    against the Department of Work and Pensions, central clearing banks and
    other financial institutions.  The conspiracy involved the stealing  of
    items of mail, in some cases whole bags of mail which were then scoured
    for financial instruments and onward passage.  The appellant and one of
    his co-conspirators worked in the barber's shop which became  a  centre
    for the receipt of the stolen property,  that  is  cheques  and  credit
    cards and stolen money orders.  The sentencing judge concluded that the
    sums involved amounted to several hundred thousands of pounds.  He  was
    sentenced to three years' imprisonment for fraud and a  further  twelve
    months' imprisonment for being in the knowing possession  for  a  false
    Angolan passport.  There was also a recommendation for deportation.

 3. It is relevant to note at this point that the appellant  was  convicted
    in the name Jo�o Didi Ndofula, an Angolan national.

 4. On 4 October 2006 the appellant was served with a notice of decision to
    make a deportation order in that  identity  and  he  lodged  an  appeal
    against that decision on 9 October 2006.  Although detained at the  end
    of his custodial sentence  on  19  November  2006,  the  appellant  was
    released later that month; his appeal was dismissed on 7 February 2007.

 5. On 23 March 2007 a deportation order was signed against  the  appellant
    in the identity Jo�o Didi Ndofula and served  on  11  April  2007.   He
    stopped complying with conditions of his release and was declared to be
    an absconder on 29 July 2008.

 6. The appellant was next encountered by the Secretary of State during  an
    enforcement visit on 8 December 2017, at which point  it  became  clear
    that the appellant was married to a citizen of Democratic  Republic  of
    Congo ("DRC") who has indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom.
    They have two British citizen children.  Submissions were made in which
    he explained his true identity and evidence of that was provided.

 7. After considering representations made to him, the Secretary  of  State
    accepted that the appellant's true identity is  Didier  [L],  a  French
    citizen and the previous deportation order in his assumed identity  was
    revoked.  The Secretary of State  then  concluded  that  the  appellant
    should be deported pursuant to the Immigration (European Economic Area)
    Regulations 2016, on the basis that he had  not  acquired  a  permanent
    right of residence under those Regulations.

 8. The  Secretary  of  State  of  State  concluded  that  the  appellant's
    behaviour was a threat to the fundamental interests of society as:-

      i) He had used a false identity and nationality in  order  to  deceive
         the immigration authorities, preventing the Immigration Rules being
         enforced in his case.

     ii) He had been deceitful about his true identity and been convicted of
         conspiracy to defraud, using false instruments and was a person who
         had used deceit to exploit public services in the  past  and  there
         was a threat that he could do so in the future.

    iii) He had been convicted of offences which are serious and his conduct
         was likely to cause public offence.

 9. The Secretary of State also noted that the appellant had  continued  to
    reside in the United Kingdom after his offence and during his  decision
    process under a false identity to deceive the immigration  authorities.
    It was noted that he had used the identity for a significant period and
    that it was deemed that he would still pose a threat of repeating  this
    offending in the future.

10. On this basis and having taken into account the sentencing remarks, the
    Secretary of State concluded that the appellant  has  a  propensity  to
    reoffend and represents a genuine,  present  and  sufficiently  serious
    threat to the public to justify  his  deportation  on  the  grounds  of
    public policy.

11. In addressing  proportionality,  the  Secretary  of  State  noted  that
    although he might have developed ties here, he had been convicted  here
    of a serious criminal offence for which he had received  a  substantial
    custodial sentence; that he was not socially and culturally  integrated
    into the United Kingdom and given his blatant  disregard  for  criminal
    immigration in the United Kingdom  but  there  is  no  reason  why  his
    rehabilitation could not be undertaken in France and that the  decision
    to deport was proportionate.

12. The Secretary of State also considered, pursuant to Article  8  of  the
    European  Convention  on  Human  Rights,  that  his   deportation   was
    proportionate.  In doing so it was  accepted  that  the  appellant  has
    three biological children living in the United  Kingdom  but  that  his
    wife could relocate with the two younger children  to  France  or  that
    they could remain here and remain in contact with him by modern methods
    of communication.

13. The  Secretary  of  State  then  certified  the  decision  pursuant  to
    Regulation 33 and the appellant was later removed but returned  to  the
    United Kingdom to participate in his appeal as indeed  he  returned  to
    participate in the appeal before me.

14. The judge heard evidence from the appellant  and  his  wife  which  was
    taken into account along with a number of  documents  relating  to  the
    position of the appellant's wife and  children.   The  judge  concluded
    that:-

      i) the Secretary of State  had  shown  that  the  appellant  had  been
         convicted of a serious offence and that more than  one  fundamental
         interest had been affected by this action and that it could not  be
         ignored that the appellant was sentenced to return to prison for no
         less than four years, had assumed another's identity  and  that  it
         was not a wish that he reveal his true identity;

     ii) the Secretary of State had  not  demonstrated  that  the  appellant
         represents a genuine present threat to the fundamental interests of
         society since there was no indication that since his conviction  he
         had been the subject of adverse interest by  the  police  or:  "Has
         acted in any other manner that  is  not  conducive  to  the  public
         good", the Secretary of  State's  representative  being  unable  to
         point to evidence indicating a propensity to reoffend;

    iii) the Secretary of State had not proved that the appellant  had  used
         deceit to exploit public services  and  that  his  case  was  based
         entirely on the appellant's previous criminal conviction,  contrary
         to Regulation 27(5)(e);

     iv) the appellant has a family life with his partner and  two  children
         and that he has a close relationship with his child from a previous
         marriage whom he sees regularly;

      v) the older child of the current relationship has a  serious  hearing
         problem and requires to be taught at a specialist deaf  school  and
         that for her to make progress it is essential that she has  support
         from the whole family;

     vi) it was  not  reasonable  to  expect  the  child  to  interrupt  the
         continuity of her treatment regime to go to a different country  to
         enjoy a family life with her father there nor was it reasonable  to
         expect family life  to  be  maintained  by  the  appellant  through
         "modern means of communication"; and accordingly, the decision  was
         not proportionate;

    vii) the Secretary of State sought permission to appeal on  the  grounds
         that the judge had erred by misdirecting himself in  law,  that  he
         had failed properly to consider the judge's sentencing  remarks  in
         respect  of  the  appellant's  convictions   which   detailed   the
         appellant's involvement and the conspiracy to defraud directed  the
         DWP resulting  in  benefit  payments  being  stolen  from  intended
         recipients, noted to be an aggravating factor; and accordingly, the
         judge had erred in  finding  the  appellant  had  not  presented  a
         genuine presence and sufficiently serious threat to the public;

   viii) the judge had erred in not taking into account the  fact  that  the
         appellant used a false identity  and  had  not  revealed  his  true
         identity until January 2018, a factor of which the sentencing judge
         would not have been aware and, the judge  had  not  taken  properly
         into  account  as  adverse  conduct  when  assessing  whether   the
         appellant presents  a  genuine  present  and  sufficiently  serious
         threat, the appellant's adverse conduct when using a false identity
         and not  ending  until  January  2018,  matters  which  are  highly
         relevant to the public  interest  assessment;  and  the  judge  had
         failed to have regard to Schedule 1  of  the  2016  Regulations  as
         required to do.

15.  On  3  October  2018,  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Robertson  granted
    permission noting that it was arguable that the  judge  had  not  taken
    into account the appellant's conduct in absconding and  using  a  false
    identity in assessing whether the appellant represents  a  genuine  and
    present threat, and the continued use of a false identity until  fairly
    recently indicating fraudulent conduct.

16. As Miss Everett submitted, the issue here  is  not  so  much  that  the
    appellant had persisted in using a false, Angolan identity  but  rather
    that he had adopted that identity and had then shed it when  it  suited
    him and had made no attempt, until he came to the attention of the Home
    Office, to regularise  his  position  or  to  explain  the  error  over
    identity.

17. Mr Malik submitted that this was not sufficient to show either  on  its
    own or  in  connection  with  the  other  matters  that  the  appellant
    represented a genuine presence and sufficiently serious threat  to  the
    public interest; and, in  the  alternative,  that  any  error  was  not
    material given the overwhelming factors in support of the removal being
    seen to be disproportionate.

18. What the appellant did was to use the fact that he had  been  convicted
    in a false identity  to  avoid  the  consequences  of  that  by  simply
    slipping back into his true identity.   First  there  was  no  evidence
    before the judge that he  had  committed  a  crime.   He  continued  to
    benefit from the confusion over his identity and avoided deportation as
    a result.  The judge was therefore incorrect in stating  [that  he  had
    acted in a manner which is not conducive to the public good].   On  the
    contrary, his actions were such as to allow him to continue to live  in
    the United Kingdom, contrary to the  decisions  taken  against  him,  a
    course of action which had continued until he was discovered.

19. Accordingly, I was satisfied that the decision did involve  the  making
    of an error of law and set it aside   I then heard  evidence  from  the
    appellant who adopted his former witness statement.

20. The appellant was asked why he had not revealed his true identity  when
    convicted.  He said that although he was amongst a group of people  who
    were arrested and that the arresting officers had said  that  "we  know
    who you are" and attributed the identity of Mr Ndofula to him as he was
    living at the address which that man had lived.  He said  that  he  had
    tried to tell them that his true identity was Didier [L].  He said that
    he had tried to give his true identity but thought that  it  would  all
    come out once he had been fingerprinted which would reveal  his  proper
    identity.  This, however, did not occur.

21. Asked why on his release he had not said anything he said that the main
    reason was he was ashamed and that he felt it could not go  on  in  the
    false identity which is why he stopped reporting.  He said that he  had
    spoken to his lawyer who had taken a statement from him but that matter
    had not been progressed.  He said that he had given his proper identity
    when arrested in 2017.  He said that he had not been  able  to  provide
    evidence of his French identity in 2005.

22. In cross-examination he said that his solicitor did know  of  his  true
    identity they did anything about it.  He  said  he  had  not  told  the
    judge.  He said that he could easily have proved his identity  but  had
    not done, that he had told the police nothing had  happened.   He  said
    that, as he had said earlier, he was waiting for  his  identity  to  be
    found out from fingerprints.

23. The appellant said that since his  release  he  had  on  occasion  when
    applying for jobs had to declare whether he had  had  convictions.   He
    had said that he had but that he had not been pressed for  any  details
    of this as to the nature of the conviction.  It was  put  to  him  that
    this was difficult to believe as was his claim not to have been able to
    prove his proper identity.

24. Asked why he absconded that he could not go on using a false  identity.
    Tt was put to him he could have contacted  the  French  authorities  to
    obtain confirmation of his identity; he said he had asked his solicitor
    to do so.

25. The appellant said that he was being supported by his older brother  in
    France but he was not using as he had been waiting for this appeal.  He
    said that the children speak a few words of French and that he and  his
    wife normally speak to each other in English.

26. I then heard submissions and reserved my decision.

    The Law

27. Regulation 27 of the EEA Regulations provides as follows:-

    27.-(1)  In  this  regulation,  a  "relevant  decision"  means  an  EEA
         decision taken on the grounds of public policy, public security  or
         public health.

         (2)  A relevant decision may not be taken to serve economic ends.

         (3)  A relevant decision may not be taken in respect  of  a  person
         with a right of permanent residence under regulation 15  except  on
         serious grounds of public policy and public security.

         (4)  A relevant decision may not  be  taken  except  on  imperative
         grounds of public security in respect of an EEA national who-

             (a)  has resided in the United Kingdom for a continuous period
             of at least ten years prior to the relevant decision; or

             (b)  is under the age of 18, unless the relevant  decision  is
             in the best interests of the person concerned, as provided for
             in the Convention on the Rights of the Child  adopted  by  the
             General Assembly of the United Nations on 20th November 1989

         (5)  The public policy and  public  security  requirements  of  the
         United Kingdom include restricting rights  otherwise  conferred  by
         these Regulations in order to protect the fundamental interests  of
         society, and where a relevant  decision  is  taken  on  grounds  of
         public policy  or   public  security  it  must  also  be  taken  in
         accordance with the following principles-

             (a)   the  decision  must  comply  with   the   principle   of
             proportionality;

             (b)  the decision must be based exclusively  on  the  personal
             conduct of the person concerned;

             (c)   the  personal  conduct  of  the  person  concerned  must
             represent a genuine, present and sufficiently  serious  threat
             affecting one of the fundamental interests of society;

             (d)  matters isolated from the  particulars  of  the  case  or
             which relate to considerations of general  prevention  do  not
             justify the decision;

             (e)  a  person's  previous  criminal  convictions  do  not  in
             themselves justify the decision.

             (f)  the decision may be taken on preventative  grounds,  even
             in the absence of a previous criminal conviction, provided the
             grounds are specific to the person.

         ...

         (8)  A court or Tribunal considering whether  the  requirements  of
         this regulation are met must (in particular)  have  regard  to  the
         considerations contained in Schedule 1  (considerations  of  public
         policy, public security and the fundamental  interests  of  society
         etc.).

28. It is important to note Dumliauskas [2015] EWCA Civ 145 at [40]

         I have to say that I have considerable  difficulty  with  what  was
         said by the Advocate General in relation to rehabilitation. In  the
         first place, it had no, or very little, relevance to the  questions
         referred to the Court, which concerned the meaning  of  "imperative
         grounds of public security". Secondly, it is only  if  there  is  a
         risk of reoffending that the power to expel arises [emphasis added]
         It is illogical, therefore, to require the competent authority  "to
         take account of factors showing that the decision adopted (i.e., to
         expel) is such as to prevent the risk of re-offending", when it  is
         that very risk that gives rise to the power to make that  decision.
         Secondly, in general "the conditions  of  [a  criminal's]  release"
         will be applicable and enforceable only  in  the  Member  State  in
         which he has been convicted and doubtless imprisoned. ...

29. The sentence highlighted is confirmed at paragraph [55].

30. In MC the Upper Tribunal held as follows:-

         1.   Essa rehabilitation principles are specific to decisions taken
             on public policy, public security and  public  health  grounds
             under regulation 21 of the 2006 EEA Regulations.

         2.   It is only if the personal conduct of the person concerned  is
             found to represent a genuine, present and sufficiently serious
             threat affecting one of the fundamental interests  of  society
             (regulation 21(5)(c)) that it  becomes  relevant  to  consider
             whether the decision is proportionate taking into account  all
             the considerations identified in regulation 21(5)-(6).

         3.   There is no specific reference in the expulsion provisions  of
             either Directive 2004/38/EC or the  2006  EEA  Regulations  to
             rehabilitation, but it has been seen by the Court  of  Justice
             as an aspect of integration,  which  is  one  of  the  factors
             referred to in Article 28(1) and regulation 21(6) (Essa (2013)
             at [23]).

         4.   Rehabilitation is not an issue to be addressed  in  every  EEA
             deportation or removal decision taken under regulation 21;  it
             will not be  relevant,  for  example,  if  rehabilitation  has
             already been completed (Essa (2013) at [32]-[33]).

         5.   ...

31. The core issue in this case  is  whether  the  appellant  represents  a
    genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one  of  the
    fundamental interests of society.  It  is  common  ground  between  the
    parties that he is not entitled to any  enhanced  level  of  protection
    pursuant to reg 27 (4).

32. The appellant has been inconsistent about the circumstances in which he
    came to be known as Mr Ndofula.  In his witness statement signed  on  6
    June 2018 he said:

         "Fear of the future consequences of my acts [before] I rather  gave
         the details of my friend Mr Joao Didi Ndofula when I  was  arrested
         as at that time he had already left the country."

33. That is in direct contrast to the account given that it was the  police
    who attributed the name to him.  But I can accept that in the heat of a
    raid there may have been a mistake as to identity, but the  explanation
    as to  how  the  appellant  did  not  put  this  right  is  lacking  in
    credibility. The appellant is a French citizen.  He  has  not  provided
    any credible explanation as to why if there were difficulties over  his
    true identity, he could not for example contact the French Embassy.  As
    he himself accepted, he was able to get  the  relevant  documents  with
    ease after his release.  There is no documentary evidence  that  he  in
    fact did tell the police of his  true  identity  and  I  note  that  he
    maintained the false identity throughout the deportation  hearings  and
    appeals which followed his release.  He did not stop using the identity
    when  released;  he  persisted  in  using  it  until  the  end  of  the
    deportation process. I conclude that the appellant has simply  lied  in
    an attempt to absolve himself from any responsibility for  what  is  on
    any view an entirely discreditable course of action.

34. I find that the appellant has tried to evade the  consequences  of  his
    serious offending and that the reason he did not give his true identity
    was that this would have resulted in a  conviction  in  his  name  and,
    possibly, attempts to remove him in his true identity.

35. That the appellant has persisted in this lie is, I consider, conduct of
    such a nature as to cast doubt on whether he has in fact rehabilitated.
    He was able to avoid some of the consequences of his offending. He cast
    off his old identity over 10 years ago and resumed his  true  identity,
    but there is no evidence of any further criminal offending for a period
    of now 12 years.

36. Taking that into account and the length of time  since  the  offending,
    and applying schedule 1 of the 2016 Regulations,  I  am  not  satisfied
    that the appellant does present a  genuine,  present  and  sufficiently
    serious  threat  to  the  interests  of  society.  In   reaching   that
    conclusion, I conclude that despite my concerns as to his truthfulness,
    there is no genuine in the sense of real risk that the appellant  is  a
    threat to any of the issues set out in  Schedule  1,  Paragraph  7,  or
    otherwise. While he may have done so  in  the  past,  there  is  simply
    insufficient evidence that he now presents such  a  threat,  given  the
    lack of evidence of criminal behaviour.  The  appellant's  conduct  may
    cause offence in that he has through failing to tell  the  truth  about
    his identity, managed to avoid  deportation  and  has  undermined  both
    immigration control and has also sought to undermine the  integrity  of
    the  criminal  justice  system.  I  accept,  nonetheless,  that   those
    activities took place some time  ago  and  there  has  been  no  repeat
    offending. Whether or not the appellant could now be prosecuted for his
    actions and deception during the criminal proceedings is not  a  matter
    for me.

37.  Further,  and  in  the  alternative,  I  am  not  satisfied  that  his
    deportation is proportionate.  In doing so  I  take  into  account  the
    provisions of Schedule 1 of the 2016 Regulations which at  paragraph  5
    provides as follows:-

         "The removal from the United Kingdom of  an  EEA  national  or  the
         family member of an EEA national who is able to provide substantive
         evidence of  not  demonstrating  a  threat  (for  example,  through
         demonstrating that the EEA national or the family member of an  EEA
         national has successfully reformed or rehabilitated) is less likely
         to be proportionate."

38. In assessing proportionality, I bear in mind that there are a number of
    serious factors which add weight to the public interest in  this  case.
    First there is the persistence in the conduct referred to  above  which
    included maintaining a false identity through  court  proceedings.   He
    failed  to  tell  the  truth  about  his  identity,  managed  to  avoid
    deportation, undermined immigration control and the  integrity  of  the
    criminal justice system. I accept, nonetheless, that  those  activities
    took place some time ago and there has been no repeat offending.

39. I accept that the appellant has a family life with his current wife and
    their two children; he also has a family  life  with  his  son  from  a
    previous relationship.   Those  are  significant  ties  to  the  United
    Kingdom and there is no indication that he will  be  able  to  maintain
    those ties were he to leave.

40. Of particular and significant importance of the facts of this  case  is
    the position of his older daughter.  As noted by Judge Hussain she  has
    a significant  and  serious  hearing  problem  such  that  she  is  now
    effectively deaf.  She requires intensive specialised learning and  she
    has been brought up in an English language medium.  There is nothing to
    suggest that she is being taught in  anything  other  than  an  English
    environment and will be taught, if appropriate, to lip read in  English
    and to use British sign language.  The material before me suggests this
    is intensive therapy which will need to continue for a number of  years
    and is integral to her  ability  to  function  fully  as  a  member  of
    society.

41. There would be inevitably a significant and serious disruption to  that
    progress were she to live in France.  I accept that she does not  speak
    French and she would, assuming that an appropriate  school  were  found
    for her in France, face the difficulty of not being dead but having  no
    knowledge of French. I accept that she  would  fact  significant  as  a
    result and that any progress she had made in lip reading would be as to
    nothing and she would have to learn French sign language from scratch.

42. In addition, the child would be taken away from her normal surroundings
    and it needs to be borne in mind that she is a British citizen.

43. I have no doubt the effects on  the  child  would,  in  the  particular
    circumstances of this case and the sensitive  stage  of  her  education
    upon which she has just embarked, be harsh.  She could not be  expected
    to leave the United Kingdom to live in France; that would simply not be
    in her best interests and indeed would be highly detrimental  to  them.
    Equally, were she to remain in the United Kingdom and be separated from
    her father, it is difficult to  see  how  any  meaningful  relationship
    could be continued given her disability.  I accept the evidence that in
    her circumstances and in light of the nature of her  disability,  being
    hugged  and  tactile  contact  with  her  father  as  part   of   their
    relationship is of significantly greater importance.

44. Taking all of these factors into account and bearing in mind fully  the
    weight to be attached to the factors as set out in Schedule 1, I  found
    that on the particular  facts  of  this  case,  in  particular  on  the
    relationship  with  his  daughter,  that  deportation  would   not   be
    proportionate and I therefore allow  the  appeal  albeit  with  reasons
    different from that reached by the First-tier Tribunal.

Summary of Conclusions

 1. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law and I set it aside.

 2. I remake the decision by allowing  the  appeal  under  the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016
