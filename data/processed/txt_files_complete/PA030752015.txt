                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1.  The  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department   (hereafter
         'Appellant') appeals against the decision of Judge  of  the  First-
         tier Tribunal Chambers  (hereafter  'judge')  who,  in  a  decision
         promulgated on 31 January 2017, allowed the appeal of VH (hereafter
         'Respondent') against the Appellant's decision of 10 November  2015
         refusing her protection and human rights claim.



Background

      2. This appeal has a lengthy procedural history. The Respondent  is  a
         female national of Vietnam born in 1974. She is married with  three
         adult children. She arrived in the UK around 6 January 2009 and was
         encountered  by  the  UK  authorities.  She  claimed  asylum  in  a
         different name  on  18  January  2009.  Checks  revealed  that  the
         Respondent had previously claimed asylum in Germany and this  claim
         had been refused on 17 October 2006. The Respondent was  registered
         as an absconder on 1 February 2009.

      3. On 30 May 2014 the Respondent was arrested by police  for  cannabis
         cultivation. On 8 October 2014 she was  convicted  after  a  guilty
         plea and, on 15 December 2014,  she  was  sentenced  to  18  months
         imprisonment. On 27 January 2015 the Respondent was served  with  a
         Decision to Deport.  On  the  same  day  she  signed  a  disclaimer
         indicating  that  she  wished  to  leave  the  UK  without  lodging
         representations against her deportation.  Upon  completion  of  her
         criminal  sentence  she  was  detained,  in  February  2015,  under
         immigration powers. The Appellant signed a deportation order on  13
         February 2015.

      4. The Respondent was referred  to  the  National  Referral  Mechanism
         (NRM) as a potential Victim of Trafficking (VOT) on 2  March  2015.
         She made an application for asylum on 1 April 2015.

      5. I briefly summarise the core elements  of  the  asylum  claim.  The
         Respondent and her family were struggling financially  in  Vietnam.
         Her husband suffered from some mental health problems and had  been
         abusive to the Respondent. �20,000 was paid to agents to facilitate
         the Respondent's travel to the UK  to  enable  her  to  work  in  a
         restaurant. �6,000 remains outstanding and the agents are harassing
         the Respondents family for this sum. It took the Respondent 3 years
         to reach the UK.  She  and  the  agent  travelled  through  several
         countries and arrived in Germany in June  2006  where  she  claimed
         asylum on  instruction  from  the  agents.  The  Respondent  always
         remained under the instruction of the agents.  The  Respondent  was
         forced to work in a brothel in  Germany.  She  was  then  taken  to
         France and was forced to have sex with  a  group  of  men.  On  one
         occasion she was punched in the jaw and  had  acid  thrown  at  her
         head. On arrival in the UK the Respondent was too  scared  to  tell
         the police the truth and, on being released in January  2006,  felt
         she had no choice but to follow the two male agents  who  had  also
         been released. The Respondent was initially locked in a  house  and
         forced to have sex with 3 male occupants. She was later passed from
         one family to another to work as  a  nanny.  She  was  taken  to  a
         brothel at the  end  of  2012  and  escaped  3  months  later.  The
         Respondent eventually met a man, NT, who offered her a cleaning job
         in a house and to  look  after  some  plants.  The  Respondent  was
         arrested for cultivating cannabis and was persuaded by NT to  plead
         guilty to get a shorter sentence.

      6. On 8 May 2015  the  Appellant,  in  her  capacity  as  a  Competent
         Authority, decided there were no reasonable grounds to suspect  the
         Respondent was a VOT. On 15 May 2015 the Respondent requested  that
         she be removed to Vietnam under the Facilitated Returns Scheme.

      7. Following a request from the  Respondent's  previous  solicitors  a
         preliminary report was obtained from Elizabeth Flint, a  consultant
         with expertise in human trafficking.  This  report,  dated  18  May
         2015, concluded that the Respondent was a potential VOT. A Rule  35
         report by Dr Rebecca Ward issued on 30 June 2015 indicated that the
         Respondent may be a VOT.

      8. A report dated 7 September 2015 authored  by  Dr  Laura  Kemmis,  a
         Registered Clinical Psychologist,  concluded  that  the  Respondent
         fulfilled the criteria  for  both  Post-Traumatic  Stress  Disorder
         (PTSD)  and  Major  Depressive  Disorder.  The  Appellant,  as  the
         Competent Authority, issued a further negative  Reasonable  Grounds
         decision on  16  September  2015.  The  Respondent  challenged  the
         Competent Authority's decision in judicial review proceedings.

      9.  On  10  November  2015  the  Appellant  refused  the  Respondent's
         protection and  human  rights  application.  In  her  decision  the
         Appellant noted several inconsistencies and implausibilities in the
         various accounts given by the Respondent. These included the length
         of time the Respondent spent in France and Germany,  the  order  in
         which different incidents occurred, the Respondent's description of
         her escape from a brothel in  the  UK,  the  Respondent's  repeated
         requests to be returned to Vietnam, and differing accounts  of  the
         Respondent's relationship with a man called 'Older brother' or  NT.
         The discrepancies "strongly suggested" to the  Appellant  that  the
         Respondent  had  been  dishonest  in  her  account.  The  Appellant
         rejected the Respondent's claim that her husband and members of her
         village would have any reason to suspect or believe that she worked
         as a prostitute. The Appellant rejected the Respondent's claimed to
         have been trafficked in the past.

     10. The Appellant also rejected the Respondent's claim that  she  would
         be at real risk of being trafficked  if  returned  to  Vietnam.  In
         reaching this conclusion the Appellant relied on extracts from  the
         Vietnam COI  report  (9  August  2013),  the  US  State  Department
         Trafficking in Persons Report 2013 and the UN Inter-Agency  Project
         on  Human  Trafficking  website,  accessed  on  4  July  2013.  The
         Appellant concluded that support and protection  from  governmental
         and NGO sources in Vietnam was generally available to VOTs and that
         the Respondent could, in any event, avail herself of  the  internal
         relocation  alternative.  The   Appellant   considered   that   the
         Respondent could seek protection from the authorities and  shelters
         provided by the government and other organisations.  The  Appellant
         considered the Respondent's  claim  to  be  a  victim  of  domestic
         violence. The Appellant acknowledged the Respondent's claim in  her
         asylum interview that her husband was an invalid who was  currently
         cared for by his parents and the absence of  any  plausible  reason
         given by the Respondent as to why her husband would commit  violent
         acts against her in the future. The Appellant considered that there
         were adequate shelters  and  assistance  available  in  Vietnam  to
         victims of domestic violence.

     11. The Respondent  appealed  the  Appellant's  decision  refusing  her
         protection and  human  rights  claim  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
         pursuant to s.82 of the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
         2002 (the 2002 Act).

     12. The  First-tier  Tribunal  allowed  the  Respondent's  appeal.  The
         Appellant obtained permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal. In a
         decision promulgated on 18 July 2017 the Upper  Tribunal  concluded
         that the First-tier Tribunal judge's decision involved  the  making
         of an error on a point of law and set that decision aside, although
         retaining the finding that the Respondent was a VOT  and  that  she
         suffered from PTSD as a result of her adverse life experiences.

     13. The Upper Tribunal remade the decision on 8 March 2018,  dismissing
         the Respondent's appeal. In a decision sealed on 2 January 2019 the
         Court of Appeal granted the Respondent  permission  to  appeal  the
         Upper  Tribunal's  remade  decision.  the  Respondent  subsequently
         sought to amend her grounds to  additionally  challenge  the  Upper
         Tribunal's 'error of law' decision of  18  July  2017.  During  the
         course of proceedings in the Court of Appeal the Official Solicitor
         became the Respondent's litigation friend on the basis that she was
         a protected party who lacked the capacity to understand and conduct
         the proceedings.

     14. In a consent order sealed by the Court of Appeal on 5 July 2019  it
         was ordered that the appeal be allowed  and  the  Upper  Tribunal's
         decisions of 8 March 2018 and 18 July 2017 be set aside. The appeal
         was remitted to the Upper Tribunal to determine whether the  First-
         tier Tribunal, in its decision of 30 January 2017, made an error on
         point of law. An accompanying Statement of Reasons  indicated  that
         the parties agreed that the Upper Tribunal gave inadequate  reasons
         for finding that the First-tier Tribunal's decision  was  wrong  in
         law. The Appellant however maintained that the judge's decision was
         wrong in law for  the  reasons  set  out  in  the  application  for
         permission to appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal.  The  Statement  of
         Reasons noted that  the  Competent  Authority  had  recognised  the
         Respondent as a VOT in  a  Conclusive  Grounds  decision  dated  13
         September 2018.

     15. In directions dated 5  August  the  Vice  President  of  the  Upper
         Tribunal appointed  the  Official  Solicitor  as  the  Respondent's
         Litigation Friend in respect of proceedings in the  Upper  Tribunal
         and directed that the first substantive hearing  before  the  Upper
         Tribunal  be  limited  to  the  question  whether  s12(2)  of   the
         Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 applies to the appeal.

     16. Thus the issue I  have  to  determine  is  whether  the  First-tier
         Tribunal judge's decision allowing the Respondent's appeal involved
         the making of an error on a point of law requiring  it  to  be  set
         aside.





The decision of the First-tier Tribunal

     17. Based on the medical evidence and the state of her mental heath the
         Respondent  did  not  give  oral  evidence  before  the  First-tier
         Tribunal. The  Respondent  produced  a  bundle  of  documents  that
         included, inter alia-alia, written statements dated 27 January 2016
         and 2 August 2016, a country expert report by Mark Sidel  dated  23
         May 2016, a psychological report by Dr Sarah  Whittaker-Howe  dated
         30 October 2016, a psychiatric report by Dr Ruth Sagovsky dated  17
         April 2016, and a Trafficking Indicator report of  Elizabeth  Flint
         dated 4 April 2016. The Appellant's bundle  contained,  inter-alia,
         the Sentencing Remarks, The preliminary report by Elizabeth  Flint,
         the Deportation Order  and  Reasons  for  Deportation  letter,  the
         Respondent's Screening  Interview  record  and  substantive  asylum
         interview record, her Statement of Facts and Grounds dated 15  July
         2015 prepared for the judicial review proceedings,  the  psychology
         report of Dr Laura Kemmis, and a Response to a  Country  of  Origin
         Information (COI)  Request  dated  3  June  2015  relating  to  the
         availability of medical treatment for VOTs in Vietnam.

     18. The judge's note of the hearing refers to  the  Presenting  Officer
         reliance on the Reasons for Refusal Letter and expressly  indicated
         that the Respondent's credibility remained in issue.

     19. The judge accurately directed himself in accordance with the burden
         and standard of proof in the context  of  a  protection  and  human
         rights appeal,  and  indicated  that  he  was  applying  the  Joint
         Presidential Guidance on vulnerable witnesses.

     20. In  the  section  of  his  decision  headed  'Findings'  the  judge
         summarised the medical  reports  from  Dr  Laura  Kemmis,  Dr  Ruth
         Sagovsky and Dr Sarah Whittaker-Howe.  Dr  Kemmis  found  that  the
         Respondent was suffering from both  PTSD  and  a  Major  Depressive
         Disorder. Dr Kemmis rejected the possibility  that  the  Respondent
         may be failing or exaggerating her symptoms.  She  considered  that
         the  Respondent's  PTSD  and  associated  memory   problems   would
         significantly have impacted upon her ability to understand and give
         a comprehensive account. Dr Sagovsky concluded that the  Respondent
         suffered  from  PTSD,  depression  and  cognitive  impairment.   Dr
         Sagovsky thought it unlikely that the Respondent was  feigning  her
         difficulties. Dr Whittaker-Howe agreed that the Respondent met  the
         criteria for complex PTSD and that this impacted upon  her  ability
         to   participate   in    the    proceedings.    The    Respondent's
         autobiographical memory was impaired and she was likely to  provide
         inconsistencies or lack of  details  during  recall/testimony.  The
         Respondent had pronounced concentration difficulties.

     21. At [19] the judge summarised the Respondent's general  account  "of
         being sold to agents who transported her from Vietnam to France and
         forced her into prostitution."

     22. At [20] the  judge  described  how  the  Appellant  attributed  the
         inconsistencies in the Respondent's account to dishonesty "...  and
         not the sort of bewilderment and misunderstanding that  it  is  now
         contended for on the basis of the expert medical reports."  In  the
         following paragraphs  the  judge  noted  the  Presenting  Officer's
         acceptance that the Respondent was  suffering  from  complex  PTSD.
         Although the Presenting Officer submitted that factors  other  than
         those relating to being trafficked could have  contributed  to  her
         condition he did not identify any factors. The judge noted that the
         Competent Authority made its decision in the absence of much of the
         medical evidence made available to the Tribunal.  The  judge  noted
         that, by the time of the asylum interview, there was evidence  that
         the Respondent was vulnerable and had been diagnosed  as  suffering
         from PTSD. At  [28]  the  judge  briefly  summarised  some  of  the
         credibility concerns arising  from  the  Respondent's  accounts  as
         identified in the Reasons for Refusal Letter.

     23. At [29] the judge, in reliance on the country report from  Dr  Mark
         Sidel and "the objective evidence", noted that there was  extensive
         trafficking/smuggling of Vietnamese into the UK  "at  the  material
         time." At [30] the judge stated that the Respondent's  province  of
         origin had experienced extensive human trafficking and that it  had
         been identified by the British  government  as  being  one  of  the
         provinces which  many  victims  were  trafficked  to  the  UK.  The
         Respondent's account of the operation of traffickers  in  her  area
         and the means by which  people  were  trafficked  to  the  UK  were
         generally confirmed by the "objective  information."  At  [33]  and
         [34] the judge found there was no  evidence  to  suggest  that  the
         Respondent's cognitive problems resulted from anything  other  than
         severe PTSD and no other causes were identified by the Appellant to
         counter the Respondent's claimed ill-treatment during the course of
         her 3-year journey to the UK. At [34] the judge stated,

             "On the basis of the evidence presented there is no other life
             experience that can be identified as being  causative  of  the
             [Respondent's] problems.  What  triggered  the  [Respondent's]
             trauma are, according to the medical findings, concerns  about
             being picked up by men again and  the  cycle  of  exploitation
             beginning again."

     24. At [36] the judge found that the Respondent's general  account  was
         supported by the objective  evidence.  The  judge  found  that  the
         Respondent was trafficked to the UK.

     25. At [37] and [38] the judge stated,

             "It  is  necessary  to  consider  whether  if   returned   the
             [Respondent] faces a real risk of being harmed further by  her
             traffickers or of being re-trafficked by them or  others.  The
             objective  evidence  shows  that  a  number  of   victims   of
             trafficking have been re-victimised upon  return  to  Vietnam.
             They are particularly  vulnerable.  Objective  evidence  shows
             that victims of trafficking from criminal networks in  Vietnam
             usually cannot rely on the police for protection and  support.
             Vietnam  uses  a  national  identification  card  system.  The
             [Respondent] would be re-integrated into  that  system.  As  a
             Vietnamese resident she would be required to produce  national
             identification in order  to  obtain  services.  She  would  be
             traceable. The residential permit system requires registration
             for residence. This, in turn would lead to the  [Respondent's]
             identification.  The  [Respondent]   could   not   reasonably,
             relocate.

             Trafficked  victims  face  stigmatisation  in   Vietnam.   The
             [Respondent] subjectively fears that  she  will  be  shown  by
             [sic] her community due to the shame of what has  occurred  to
             her since leaving Vietnam."

     26. Having found that the Respondent was a refugee  the  judge  allowed
         the asylum appeal.

The challenge to the judge's decision

     27. The grounds of appeal contended that the judge misdirected  himself
         in law by failing to adequately consider the Competent  Authority's
         reasonable grounds decision and by failing to give adequate reasons
         for preferring the evidence of the Respondent's expert witnesses on
         the issue of trafficking. The grounds additionally  contended  that
         the judge erred in law by failing to  consider  alternative  causes
         for the PTSD diagnosis. Neither grounds were advanced by Mr  Clarke
         at the hearing  on  21  August  2019.  It  was  accepted  that  the
         Respondent was a VOT and that the judge had  been  entitled  to  so
         find.

     28. The remaining grounds of appeal, upon which  Mr  Clarke  did  rely,
         relate to the absence of any consideration  by  the  judge  of  the
         extent to which the Respondent's family members would  be  able  to
         provide her with support and thereby reduce  the  likelihood  of  a
         risk of being ill-treated  by  her  traffickers  or  of  being  re-
         trafficked, and the adequacy of the reasons given by the  judge  in
         support of his findings that the Vietnamese  authorities  would  be
         unable to provide the Respondent with a sufficiency  of  protection
         and that the internal relocation alternative was not  available  to
         her.

     29. According to Mr Clarke most of the reasons given by the  judge  for
         concluding that the Respondent faced a real risk of harm  from  her
         traffickers or of being re-trafficked were contained  in  [37]  and
         [38]. In neither paragraph was there any specific reference to  the
         Respondent's family members. The judge failed to make  any  factual
         findings in respect of the Respondent's personal circumstances  and
         there was  no  assessment  of  her  relationship  with  her  family
         members. There was, as a consequence, no finding in relation to any
         support network that may be available to the Respondent that  could
         reduce the likelihood of her being targeted by  traffickers  or  of
         being re-trafficked.

     30. With respect to the grounds relating to the adequacy of the judge's
         reasons in respect of the sufficiency of  protection  and  internal
         relocation issues, both the grounds and Mr  Clarke  relied  on  the
         reported case of Nguyen (Anti-Trafficking Convention:  respondent's
         duties) [2015] UKUT 00170 (IAC). This was not  a  Country  Guidance
         decision and does not appear to have been cited to  the  First-tier
         Tribunal judge or in  the  Reasons  for  Refusal  Letter  dated  10
         November 2015. It nevertheless suggested that Vietnam was  a  large
         country with a large population and that, in respect of Ms  Nguyen,
         the chances of her coming across here traffickers was  slight.  The
         Tribunal also found there was evidence to support the  SSHD's  view
         that  there  was  a  sufficiency  of  protection  provided  by  the
         Vietnamese authorities. Mr Clarke submitted that the  judge  failed
         to  give  adequate  reasons  for  finding   that   the   Vietnamese
         authorities  were  unable  to  provide  the   Respondent   with   a
         sufficiency of protection. Nor was there any finding in respect  of
         the reach and influence of the traffickers.

     31. Ms Meredith submitted that the judge's findings at  [37]  and  [38]
         had to be considered in the context of, and with reference to,  his
         previous findings, particularly those relating  to  the  Respondent
         being a VOT. The judge  had  previously  referred  to  the  country
         expert report at [29] and [30] and had  given  sustainable  reasons
         for concluding that the authorities in Vietnam were unlikely to  be
         able to protect the Respondent from her traffickers. The  Appellant
         had never submitted that the Respondent's family would be  able  to
         support her against the traffickers. Her written  evidence  in  any
         event suggested that her family had  now  turned  against  her  and
         would be unwilling to offer her any support. Even if the judge made
         no specific findings in respect of the  Respondent's  family,  this
         could not have made any material difference as the  expert  medical
         and country evidence was so strong and the Respondent's account was
         that her husband was an invalid and had been abusive  towards  her.
         it was submitted that Nguyen was determined on its  own  facts  and
         was not a CG case.

     32. I reserved my decision.

Discussion

     33. There was no application by Mr  Clarke  to  amend  the  grounds  of
         appeal. The 'error of law' hearing proceeded on the basis that  the
         judge had been entitled to find the Respondent was a VOT. The judge
         attached significant weight to the medical reports which, in  turn,
         established that the Respondent's medical condition was  likely  to
         have significantly impacted on her ability to understand and give a
         comprehensive account and that her concentration  difficulties  and
         memory problems were capable of accounting for the  inconsistencies
         identified by the Appellant. The Respondent consistently maintained
         that she had been accompanied by traffickers from Vietnam and  that
         she still owed around �6,000 to the traffickers. This  indicates  a
         situation of debt bondage. She  consistently  maintained  that  her
         family  were  struggling  financially  and  that  her  husband  was
         incapable of working. The judge recorded the evidence from Dr  Mark
         Sidel  to  the  effect  that  the  Respondent's  account  of  being
         trafficked was consistent with other instances of trafficking  from
         Vietnam and that the Respondent's  province  in  Vietnam  had  been
         identified as one that experienced extensive human trafficking.  At
         [36] the judge specifically found  that  the  Respondent's  general
         account was supported by the objective evidence before him. At  the
         beginning  of  [37]  the  judge  then  asked  himself  whether  the
         Respondent would be at risk of further harm in  Vietnam  "...  from
         her traffickers." It follows that the judge's conclusion at the end
         of that paragraph - that the Respondent was trafficked to  the  UK,
         must necessarily include an  acceptance  that  the  Respondent  was
         trafficked from Vietnam. The  judge's  finding  at  [30]  that  the
         Respondent's account of the operation of  the  traffickers  in  her
         area had  been  confirmed  by  the  objective  evidence  must  also
         necessitate, taken in conjunction  with  the  acceptance  that  she
         feared being re-trafficked and the  consistency  of  her  claim  to
         still  owe  money  to  the  traffickers,  an  acceptance  that  the
         Respondent was in a situation of debt bondage.

     34. The judge did not make any  specific  finding  in  respect  of  the
         Respondent's relationship  with  her  family  in  Vietnam.  In  her
         various accounts the Respondent claimed to  maintain  some  contact
         with her immediate family. She claimed in her asylum interview that
         her husband was an invalid and was being cared for by his  parents.
         In her supplementary statement dated 2 August 2016 she claimed that
         although her family do not know what  she  has  gone  through,  her
         husband keeps telling her that she went  to  the  UK  to  become  a
         prostitute and that he was very abusive to her about this, and even
         turned her children against her. She claimed her husband was always
         abusive to her (a claim made in her earlier statement) and that  he
         would harm her if she returned. The judge did not however make  any
         specific finding of fact in respect of these particular assertions.



     35. It is not apparent from either the Reasons for  Refusal  Letter  or
         the judge's decision that the Appellant  ever  suggested  that  the
         Respondent's family could support her against a risk of  being  re-
         trafficked. The grounds of appeal do not explain, even  in  general
         terms,  how  the  presence  of  family  members  could   constitute
         protection against traffickers. The Refugee Convention  anticipates
         protection being provided by the state, not by family members.  The
         pivotal issue is whether  the  state  is  capable  of  providing  a
         sufficiency of protection to the Respondent in her home area.  Even
         if the judge were to reject  the  Respondent's  claimed  antagonism
         from her immediate family members, it is difficult to determine how
         those family members could have protected her  from  the  continued
         adverse interest  of  traffickers.  The  Respondent  became  a  VOT
         because she and her family were in a vulnerable position. There  is
         nothing in the evidence to suggest her family have any influence or
         power; the very fact that she was trafficked suggests the opposite.
         Even if her family were entirely supportive of  her,  it  would  be
         wholly unreasonable to expect them to stand up to traffickers  who,
         on the evidence accepted  by  the  judge,  act  in  a  vicious  and
         organised manner. It follows that  the  failure  by  the  judge  to
         consider whether the Respondent's family could  support  her  could
         have no material bearing in determining whether  she  was  at  risk
         from traffickers in her home area.

     36. At the beginning of [37] the judge properly asked  himself  whether
         the Respondent faced a real risk of being  further  harmed  by  her
         traffickers or of being re-trafficked by them or others. The  judge
         referred to 'objective evidence' showing that a number of VOTs  had
         been re-victimised on return to  Vietnam,  and  that  VOTs  usually
         cannot rely on the police for protection and support. The reference
         to 'objective evidence' must include the expert country report from
         Dr Sidel as there is marked  similarity  in  language  between  the
         content of his report and the judge's findings  at  both  [37]  and
         [38]. It is clear that the judge was relying on the  expert  report
         in reaching his conclusions on the existence of  a  sufficiency  of
         protection. Dr Sidel acknowledged the existence of some trafficking
         programs in Vietnam but stated that  the  services  and  facilities
         available for returned VOTs to Vietnam were relatively minimal  and
         shelters were underfunded and insufficient to meet the  demands  of
         the  trafficked   population.   He   additionally   discussed   the
         involvement  of  corrupt  officials   in   identifying   VOTs   for
         trafficking and smuggling networks. There has been no challenge  at
         any stage to the standing of Dr Sidel as an expert. Also before the
         judge  were  the  a  number  of  background  human  rights  reports
         including a June 2015 Joint Report  by  the  Vietnam  Committee  on
         Human Rights and  the  International  Federation  of  Human  Rights
         relating to Violations of Rights of Women in Vietnam,  and  the  US
         State Department Trafficking in Persons Reports for 2014 and  2016,
         all of which supported the conclusions  of  Dr  Sidel.  Whilst  the
         judge did not identify each report it is sufficiently clear that he
         had regard to the expert and background  evidence  adduced  by  the
         Respondent. The judge's conclusion that the Respondent was at  real
         risk of harm by her  traffickers  or  of  being  re-trafficked  was
         supported by the evidence upon which he relied.

     37. The grounds contend that  the  judge  should  have  considered  the
         reported case of Nguyen. On the facts of that case  Ms  Nguyen  had
         been persuaded by her employer to  go  to  Hungary  where  she  was
         locked up and raped and thereafter forced to be a  prostitute.  She
         managed to escape and entered the United Kingdom where she had  two
         children and eventually claimed asylum. She feared  that  the  gang
         who had arranged for her to travel would target her for money,  she
         claimed to be a vulnerable person, and claimed  that  she  and  her
         children would not be safe. Having referred  to  relevant  extracts
         from the US State  Department  Trafficking  in  Persons  Report  on
         Vietnam of 2010, the relevant  COIR  report  and  a  Freedom  House
         Report of 2011 the Tribunal noted that Vietnam was a large  country
         of some 90 million people with a number of large cities. Ms  Nguyen
         was not a person of any adverse interest to the government and  the
         chance of her coming across her traffickers was  said  to  be  very
         slight. On the facts of that case the Tribunal were  not  satisfied
         that Ms Nguyen had demonstrated that she faced a real risk of  ill-
         treatment  on  return  to  Vietnam  on  account  of  her   previous
         experience as a victim of trafficking or  otherwise.  The  Tribunal
         were satisfied that the background evidence they considered,  which
         did not include any expert report, did not establish that Ms Nguyen
         would be at risk of a breach of Article 3 or that even if she was a
         member of a  particular  social  group  of  trafficked  women  from
         Vietnam she should face a real risk of harm  on  that  account.  At
         paragraph 52 the Tribunal held,

             "It is speculative and no more to suggest that she would  face
             a real risk of coming across her previous traffickers or  that
             as a woman in the circumstances in which she would return  she
             faced a real risk of being trafficked by someone else.  We  do
             not understand it to have been suggested  that  she  would  be
             unable  to  make  contact  again  with  her   brothers,   born
             respectively in 1989 and 1991, or  with  her  sister  born  in
             1993. There is evidence, in the US State Department Report  of
             2010, referred to  in  paragraph  50  above,  to  support  the
             respondent's conclusion in the decision letter that there is a
             sufficiency of  protection  provided  by  the  authorities  in
             Vietnam. Accordingly we find that she has  not  shown  a  real
             risk on return to Vietnam of persecution or a  breach  of  her
             human rights."

     38. As already mentioned, Nguyen is not a CG  case.  The  decision  was
         reported to give guidance  on  the  duties  owed  to  a  victim  of
         historic  trafficking  in  a  country  to  which  they   were   not
         trafficked. There was no expert report before  that  Tribunal.  Nor
         was any reference made to Nguyen in either the Reasons for  Refusal
         Letter or by the Presenting  Officer  at  the  First-tier  Tribunal
         hearing. The conclusion reached in Nguyen very much depended on its
         own particular facts. Whilst some features were similar it  is  not
         clear whether Ms Nguyen was in a position of debt bondage  and  her
         mental health condition was nowhere near as severe as that  of  the
         Respondent. I am not persuaded that  the  judge  erred  in  law  in
         failing to consider a decision  that  was  not  designated  Country
         Guidance, which was not brought to  his  attention,  and  in  which
         there was no detailed expert report assessing the availability of a
         sufficiency of protection in the VOT's home area. As pointed out by
         the  judge  at  [30],  the  British  government  has   specifically
         identified the Respondent's home province as one  from  which  many
         victims  are  trafficked  to  the  UK.  This,  coupled   with   the
         unchallenged standing of Dr Sidel, suggests  that  this  particular
         Respondent would not have  been  provided  with  a  sufficiency  of
         protection in her home area. The judge was rationally  entitled  to
         rely on the conclusions of a country expert in making his findings.

     39. Nor do I find that the judge erred in law  in  concluding  that  it
         would not be reasonable to expect the Respondent to relocate within
         Vietnam. The judge supported his conclusion  by  reference  to  the
         national identification card system in Vietnam and  the  likelihood
         that the Respondent would, if returned,  have  to  be  reintegrated
         into that system  in  order  to  obtain  services.  The  judge  was
         entitled on the evidence before him to conclude that the Respondent
         would be traceable by a trafficking  gang  to  whom  she  owed  the
         equivalent of �6,000. Dr Sidel referred to the  underfunded  nature
         of shelters in Vietnam and their insufficiency to meet the  demands
         of the trafficked population and found that corruptible authorities
         would be able to identify her through official records and mandated
         systems. These findings must be considered in the  context  of  the
         Respondent's serious mental health condition. The judge was acutely
         aware of the Respondent's complex PTSD  and  her  Major  Depressive
         Disorder and found her to be a traumatised individual. The  judge's
         conclusion in respect of the availability  of  internal  relocation
         was one rationally open to him on the evidence before him  and  for
         the reasons given. I find there is no error of  law  requiring  the
         decision to be set aside.
