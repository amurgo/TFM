                                   Between

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                   Appellant

                            Memorandum of Hearing

1.   The Appellant is  referred  to  as  the  Secretary  of  State  and  the
    Respondent is referred to as the Claimant.

2.   The Claimant, a national of Pakistan,  date  of  birth  4  March  1988,
    appealed against a decision of the Secretary of State to refuse a  Tier
    4 PBS visa on 4 October 2013.

3.   At a hearing the matter came before First-tier Tribunal Judge  Boardman
    on 24 November 2014.  The judge was unaware that the Claimant had  left
    the UK on or about 16 September 2014  and  had  signed  a  form  IS.101
    confirming the withdrawal of his appeal.  In ignorance of  that  matter
    the judge proceeded to hear and allow the appeal. There was  no  appeal
    for  the  Original  Tribunal  to  determine:  The  appeal  having  been
    abandoned by operation of law (Section 104(4) NIAA 2002 as amended  and
    as saved by the Immigration Act 2014 (T&SP) commencement Order  No.  3)
    The Original Tribunal's decision was a nullity. The grant of permission
    by First-tier Tribunal judge Ford, on 24 January 2015, was a nullity.

4.   The fee award made by the judge is also a nullity

5.   In those circumstances  there  was  no  appeal  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal on 24 November 2014 and there is no decision to appeal.



Signed        Date 26 March 2015
