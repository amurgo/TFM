Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr D. Fadina of Fadina & Associates
For the Respondent:    Mr E. Tufan, Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the re-making of the decision in Mr Smith's  appeal  to  the
       Tribunal, the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  having  been  set
       aside by the decision I made that it contained an error on  a  point
       of law.  A copy of that decision is annexed to this determination.


Introduction and Immigration history

    2. The appellant was born on 7 March 1990. He is a citizen of Barbados,
       now aged 27. He arrived in the United Kingdom to join his mother who
       had the benefit of a work permit. On his arrival on 26 July 2002, he
       was aged 12. He  was  granted  successive  periods  of  leave  as  a
       dependent child until 7 December 2012.  By that time he was aged 22.


    3. I can properly disregard any other offending save his conviction  on
       7 June 2010 at Wood Green Crown Court for conspiracy to rob.  On  22
       December 2010, when he was 20, he received a sentence of three years
       custody in a Young Offender Institution. Unfortunately, at the  time
       of his sentencing, his partner (to whom I shall refer  as  'Marilyn'
       without, I hope, showing any disrespect), was  pregnant  with  their
       daughter M who was born in  the  United  Kingdom  on  4  June  2011.
       Both Marilyn and M are British citizens.


    4. The appellant was released on 20 January 2012. He has not reoffended
       since.


    5. Various applications then followed for indefinite leave to remain on
       the  basis  of  his  long  residence  which  were  unsuccessful  and
       eventually prompted the respondent to commence proceedings to deport
       the appellant. On 21 August 2014 a deportation order was made by the
       Secretary of State under the provisions of section 32(5) of  the  UK
       Borders Act 2007.  The appeal process was commenced by his notice of
       1 September 2014.


    6. His appeal has had an unfortunate history.


    7. The first appeal was allowed on 17 January 2015  by  the  First-tier
       Tribunal but was found to have been vitiated  by  an  error  of  law
       principally due to a lack of adequate reasoning. It  was  thus  that
       the matter came before the First-tier Tribunal for a second time  on
       31 March 2016 which resulted in the second successful  determination
       promulgated  on  11  May  2016.  Regrettably,  I  found   out   that
       determination was also tainted by legal error such that it  required
       me to re-make the decision.


    8. For the purposes of this hearing I had  the  benefit  of  a  witness
       statement  signed  by  the  appellant  in  which  he  described  his
       background. The appellant's father and mother divorced when he was 5
       years old and he grew up without any knowledge  of  his  father.  He
       completed his secondary education in 2006 and obtained a Diploma  in
       Sport Science in 2008. He completed  the  first  stage  of  his  BSc
       course.  Upon discharge from custody in  2012,  the  appellant  took
       steps to complete his degree.  He  did  this  successfully  and  was
       awarded a BSc in Sports Science from Greenwich University in 2013.

    9. He describes how his mother is now a  British  citizen  as  are  his
       brother and sister. All  our  present  and  settled  in  the  United
       Kingdom. He states that he does not  have  any  known  relatives  in
       Barbados and is unaware of the whereabouts of his biological father.

   10. In the course of his evidence to me,  the  appellant  described  the
       relationship he developed with his daughter and her mother.  He  has
       known Marilyn for about 12 years during which time he described  the
       relationship as being 'on-and-off'.  M was born  whilst  he  was  in
       prison but Marilyn started bringing her to prison twice a  month  on
       play-day visits in a cr�che setting. There were also other visits so
       that, in total, Marilyn visited about  three  times  a  month.  That
       continued until his release  in  January  2012.  Upon  release,  the
       appellant was  living  with  his  mother  but  seeing  his  daughter
       regularly, perhaps two or three times a week. The distance was a few
       minutes by  car,  perhaps  15  or  20  minutes  walking.  Often  the
       arrangement was informal when the appellant would just 'pop  in'  to
       see his daughter.

   11. There was, unhappily, a breakdown in the relationship in the  course
       of 2012.  In his evidence to me, he described how Marilyn would  not
       allow him to see his daughter as much as he wanted. This resulted in
       court proceedings to recommence contact.  Initially,  the  appellant
       had the benefit of a contact order provided  in  August  2012  which
       permitted contact to take place in a contact  centre.  It  is  clear
       that the parties took steps to improve their  relationship  and  now
       maintain a good relationship with each other.  They agreed that this
       limited contact was over-restrictive. At page 35 of the bundle there
       is a contact order dated 4 October 2013 in which the appellant might
       have such contact as the parents might  agree,  a  clear  indication
       that their relationship had improved to the extent  that  they  were
       able to make mature and sensible decisions in relation to M's future
       without further interventions in Court.


   Marilyn's studies

   12. Marilyn is currently studying at Birmingham  University  for  a  BSc
       (Hons) in Dental and Oral Science, [p.22]. She wishes  to  pursue  a
       career as a dental hygienist and therapist. The course  has  reached
       the end of its first year but there are still two further years.  It
       will end in 2019.


   M's medical condition

   13. M, now aged 5, has a congenital ptosis of her left eye.  She is self-
       conscious and sensitive to the reaction of those around her.  She is
       in need of support  and  encouragement.   She  has  a  squint.   She
       receives support at school on the basis of  her  visual  impairment.
       Ptosis is a drooping or falling of the upper eyelid, commonly due to
       a defect in the muscle which raises the  eyelids.   M  has  had  two
       operations already, one in 2012 and the second in 2015. She  is  due
       to have a further operation at Great Ormond Street  Hospital.   This
       was described by Marilyn as permanent corrective surgery.


   14. M is under the care of the Moorfields Eye Hospital.  In reading  the
       papers that have been submitted in support of this appeal I noted  a
       letter from her counsellor within Moorfields who stated this;

     M has definitely made progress, she comes across as more confident, her
           home-schoolbook shows that she's managing her behaviour well and
           she has a mantra when she is struggling e.g. "I can do it" or "I
           tried".  Having  said  that,  she   seems   to   be   struggling
           emotionally; for example,  during  the  last  two  sessions  she
           didn't play in the same way that she has previously, instead she
           spent a lot of time pulling the toys apart and although she said
           "I tried" when she wasn't able to complete tasks,  there  was  a
           sense of frustration and anger with herself. Also, the fact that
           she wet herself during the session is an indication of a lack of
           containment.
     My concern  is  that  M  could  be  internalising  her  feelings  while
           seemingly doing okay on the surface."

   15. There are also letters making reference to a referral to the  speech
       and language therapy  service,  an  assessment  by  the  Educational
       Psychologist and that she would benefit from regular counselling and
       play therapy sessions.


   16. Mrs Marshall, the appellant's mother, described M as having  complex
       needs.  She had been slow developmentally. She is visually impaired.
       Her speech development was poor. She benefits from a team around her
       to care for her needs.


   17. Mrs Marshall spoke of M being extremely  close  to  her  father.  He
       provides her, she said, with much-needed reassurance.


The appellant's role in family life with Marilyn and M

   18. Currently, the appellant  spends  time  with  his  daughter  between
       Sunday evening and Wednesday, often staying overnight  with  Marilyn
       because she has to leave the home so early on Monday morning.

   19. Marilyn described in warm terms the contribution that has been  made
       by the appellant. She accepted that upon his release there had  been
       a breakdown in their relationship. She was very angry  that  he  was
       not around when she was pregnant. She described herself as 'shutting
       down'. Tension arose after his release. She spoke intelligently that
       his anger had got in the  way  of  them  communicating  as  parents.
       However,  since  2014  the  couple  have  been  seeing  each   other
       regularly. She spoke of the 'massive part' he had played over  those
       years. She told me that the appellant sees M almost every  day  and,
       of course, between Sunday evenings and Wednesday.

   20. Marilyn commutes to  Birmingham  five  days  a  week  from  Dagenham
       leaving at 5.30 a.m. in the morning. Her  parents  provide  help  as
       well on Thursday and Friday. In order to do so, she stays  overnight
       with them but both her mother and father work.

   21. She told me that she wanted to marry the appellant but they are  not
       living together. In particular, she described the  difficulties  for
       him as he does not work.  There have been disagreements. The routine
       of daily  commuting  is  extraordinarily  expensive,  costing  about
       �1,000 a month, most of which appears to be provided by loans.

   22. More positively, once her degree course is ended in 2019 she will be
       able  to  be  registered  as  a  hygienist   without   any   further
       qualifications. It is her intention to work  as  a  hygienist  in  a
       dental surgery.

   23. I was impressed by her engaging personality. She  is  clearly  hard-
       working and ambitious for herself. She struck me as being  committed
       to  doing  the  best  she  could  for  M.   She  gave  her  evidence
       confidently and with an appropriate degree of humour. She struck  me
       as being realistic.

Mrs Marshall

   24. The appellant's mother also gave evidence. It was  readily  apparent
       that Mrs Marshall took immediate steps to re-establish a useful life
       for the appellant after his release from prison. He had  called  her
       whilst in prison to arrange a return to  university  which  she  had
       succeeded in doing, albeit this  required  him  to  wait  until  the
       following academic year to resume his studies. She described how  he
       was very angry and this had changed his  personality.  There  is  no
       suggestion that this is currently a difficulty.  She  described  how
       secure he was in the relationship he had with his sister and younger
       brother. She was an impressive witness;  articulate,  sensitive  and
       perceptive. It was no surprise to me when, later  in  her  evidence,
       she described herself as acting as  a  Head  Teacher  in  a  Primary
       School.


   25. She provided a  certain  degree  of  insight  into  the  appellant's
       troubled youth. It was her view that he felt insecure because of the
       presence of her second husband within the family. Matters came to  a
       head when her husband, not the appellant's father, hit him and  this
       resulted in her  request  for  social  services  to  intervene.  The
       turbulence of this period has resulted, she feels, in the  appellant
       understanding that he would not like a repetition of  this  for  his
       daughter. Her evidence was that the relationship over the last three
       years has been very settled. She clearly hopes  that  the  three  of
       them would continue as a family unit.

The statutory provisions and the Immigration Rules


   26. The appellant is a foreign criminal, according to the definition set
       out in s.117D of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act,  2002,
       as inserted by s. 19 of the Immigration Act 2014 in that he has been
       sentenced by a United Kingdom court to a period of  imprisonment  of
       at least 12 months and references to a person who has been sentenced
       to a period of imprisonment include a person who  is  sentenced  to
       detention at an institution for young offenders.


   27. Paragraph 3(o) of the  Immigration  Act  2014  (Commencement  No  1,
       Transitory (sic) and Savings Provisions)  Order  2014  (SI  1820  of
       2014) provided that 28 July 2014 was the day appointed  for  section
       19 of the 2014 Act to come into force.


   28. Sections 117A-C provide, where material:


      117A Application of this Part
      (1)  This Part applies where  a  court  or  tribunal  is  required  to
      determine whether a decision made under the Immigration Acts-
      (a)  breaches a person's right to respect for private and family  life
      under Article 8, and
      (b)  as a result would be unlawful under section 6 of the Human Rights
      Act 1998.
      (2)  In  considering  the  public  interest  question,  the  court  or
      tribunal must (in particular) have regard-
      (a) in all cases, to the considerations listed in section 117B, and
      (b) in cases concerning the deportation of foreign criminals,  to  the
      considerations listed in section 117C.
      (3)  In subsection (2),  "the  public  interest  question"  means  the
      question of whether an interference with a person's right  to  respect
      for private and family life is justified under Article 8(2).


      117B Article 8: public interest considerations applicable in all cases
      (1)The maintenance of effective immigration controls is in the  public
      interest.
      (2) It is in the public interest, and in particular in  the  interests
      of the economic well-being of the United  Kingdom,  that  persons  who
      seek to enter or remain in  the  United  Kingdom  are  able  to  speak
      English, because persons who can speak English-
      (a) are less of a burden on taxpayers, and
      (b) are better able to integrate into society.
      (3) It is in the public interest, and in particular in  the  interests
      of the economic well-being of the United  Kingdom,  that  persons  who
      seek to  enter  or  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  are  financially
      independent, because such persons-
      (a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and
      (b) are better able to integrate into society.
      (4) Little weight should be given to-
      (a) a private life, or
      (b)  a  relationship  formed  with  a  qualifying  partner,  that   is
      established by a person at a time when the person  is  in  the  United
      Kingdom unlawfully.
      (5) Little weight should be given to a private life established  by  a
      person at a time when the person's immigration status is precarious.
      (6) In the case of a person who is  not  liable  to  deportation,  the
      public interest does not require the person's removal where-
      (a) the person has a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with
      a qualifying child, and
      (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave the United
      Kingdom.

      117C Article 8 additional considerations in  cases  involving  foreign
      criminals.
      (1) The deportation of foreign criminals is in the public interest.
      (2) The more serious the offence committed by a foreign criminal,  the
      greater is the public interest in deportation of the criminal.
      (3) In the case of a foreign criminal ("C") who has not been sentenced
      to a period of imprisonment of four years or more, the public interest
      requires C's deportation unless Exception 1 or Exception 2 applies.
      (4) Exception 1 applies where-
      (a) C has been lawfully resident in the United Kingdom for most of C's
      life,
      (b) C is socially and culturally integrated in the United Kingdom, and
      (c) there would be very significant obstacles to C's integration  into
      the country to which C is proposed to be deported.
      (5)  Exception  2  applies  where  C  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
      relationship with a qualifying partner, or a  genuine  and  subsisting
      parental relationship with a qualifying child, and the effect  of  C's
      deportation on the partner or child would be unduly harsh.


      (7) The considerations in subsections (1) to (6) are to be taken  into
      account where a court or tribunal is considering a decision to  deport
      a foreign criminal only to the extent that the reason for the decision
      was the offence or offences for which the criminal has been convicted.

   29. This is the derivation of the 'unduly harsh' test.


   30.  The  Immigration  Rules  were  similarly  amended  to  reflect  the
       introduction of the new provisions in Part 5 of the 2002 Act:

      397. A deportation order will not be  made  if  the  person's  removal
      pursuant to the order would be contrary to the UK's obligations  under
      the  Refugee  Convention  or  the  Human  Rights   Convention.   Where
      deportation would not be contrary to these obligations, it  will  only
      be  in  exceptional  circumstances  that  the   public   interest   in
      deportation is outweighed.


      398. Where a person claims that their deportation would be contrary to
      the UK's obligations under Article 8 of the Human  Rights  Convention,
      and (a) the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to  the
      public good [and in  the  public  interest]  because  they  have  been
      convicted of an offence for which they have been sentenced to a period
      of imprisonment of at least four years; (b)  the  deportation  of  the
      person from the UK is conducive to the public good [and in the  public
      interest] because they have been convicted of  an  offence  for  which
      they have been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of  less  than  4
      years but at least 12 months; or (c) the  deportation  of  the  person
      from the UK is conducive  to  the  public  good  [and  in  the  public
      interest] because, in the  view  of  the  Secretary  of  State,  their
      offending has caused serious harm or they are  a  persistent  offender
      who shows a particular disregard for the law, the Secretary  of  State
      in assessing that claim will consider whether paragraph  399  or  399A
      applies and, if it does not, [the public interest in deportation  will
      only be outweighed by other factors where there  are  very  compelling
      circumstances over and above those described  in  paragraphs  399  and
      399A.]


      399. This paragraph applies where paragraph 398(b) or (c) applies if -
      (a) the person has a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with
      a child under the age of 18 years who is in the UK and (i)  the  child
      is a  British  citizen;  or  (ii)  the  child  has  lived  in  the  UK
      continuously for at least the seven years  immediately  preceding  the
      date of the immigration decision; and in either case (a) [it would  be
      unduly harsh for the child to live in the country to which the  person
      is to be deported]; and (b) [it would be unduly harsh for the child to
      remain in the UK without the person who is to be deported]; or (b) the
      person has a genuine and subsisting relationship with a partner who is
      in the UK and is a British citizen, [or] settled in the UK,  [(i)  the
      relationship was formed at a time when the person  (deportee)  was  in
      the UK lawfully and their immigration status was not  precarious;  and
      (ii) it would be unduly harsh for that partner to live in the  country
      to  which  the  person  is  to  be  deported  because  of   compelling
      circumstances over and above those  described  in  paragraph  EX.2  of
      Appendix FM; and (iii) it would be unduly harsh for  that  partner  to
      remain in the UK without the person who is to be deported].


      399A. This paragraph applies where paragraph 398(b) or (c) applies  if
      - [(a) the person has been lawfully resident in the UK for most of his
      life; and (b) he is socially and culturally integrated in the UK;  and
      (c) there would be very significant obstacles to his integration  into
      the country to which it is proposed he is deported].


   31. The Statement of Changes in the Immigration Rules HC 532 took effect
       on 28 July 2014 and applies  to  all  ECHR  Article  8  claims  from
       foreign criminals which are to be decided on or after that date. The
       changes in the 2014 Rules are set out above.

Analysis

   32. It is plain that ss 117A-D of the 2002  Act  (directed  towards  the
       judiciary) and the Immigration Rules (directed towards all  decision
       makers) were designed to operate in tandem with each  other  and  to
       operate as a scheme that operated in conjunction with each other and
       not disjunctively.


   33. The expression 'unduly harsh' has been authoritatively determined by
       the Court of Appeal in MM to  which  I  shall  return.   It  remains
       important, however,  to  realise  that  these  are  ordinary  words,
       commonly used, and they should bear their  ordinary  meaning.   They
       should not become encrusted with  unnecessary  amounts  of  judicial
       interpretation.  Simple examples may  afford  a  good  insight  into
       their ordinary meaning.  It is unduly harsh to  sentence  a  man  to
       life imprisonment for  shoplifting.   It  is  not  unduly  harsh  to
       sentence a man to life imprisonment for murder.  In the  former  the
       sentence is disproportionate and unreasonable; in the latter  it  is
       not.  Hence, in the former it is unduly harsh; in the latter, it may
       be harsh but it is not unduly harsh.  To separate a child  from  her
       father when he is sentenced to life imprisonment for shop-lifting is
       unduly harsh as a necessary consequence of the same being so for the
       father.  To separate a child from her father when he is sentenced to
       life imprisonment for murder is harsh, but for the same reasons, not
       unduly harsh.  The consequences for the child; her sense of loss and
       of separation; the deprivation of  the  support  and  daily  comfort
       afforded by her father; the harshness: all may well be the same  for
       the child, but in the former case, it will be unduly harsh  and,  in
       the latter, not so.


   34. Into this already complex mix, there must be a consideration of  the
       particular effect upon the child.  It must be taken as  a  given  in
       such a situation, that there will be harshness  in  any  separation.
       In the words  of  countless  psychological  reports  describing  the
       effect upon a child of  a  potential  separation,  it  may  well  be
       'devastating' but that is not enough to  prevent  the  father  being
       imprisoned or imprisonment would never be the proportionate sentence
       for a man convicted who has a young child.  I have,  however,  found
       it to be unduly harsh when the  child's  mother  has  mental  health
       difficulties  and  the  father  is  the  sole  effective  carer  and
       separation is likely to lead to the  child  being  placed  in  care.
       This proves little save that these cases are fact-sensitive.


   35. A further ingredient into a proper assessment is paying  due  regard
       to the law.  In the context  of  this  type  of  case,  the  law  is
       contained in statute and the statutory criteria  developed  for  the
       assessment of the public interest.  Unless  it  is  struck  down  as
       unlawful, if statute draws a bright line between a person  sentenced
       to 12 months imprisonment but less than 4 years,  a  decision  maker
       must respect that distinction.  Care should be taken not to misapply
       an unduly harsh test in order  to  defeat  the  will  of  Parliament
       because the decision maker considers a sentence of  imprisonment  of
       12 months is too low a threshold.  There is a greater risk  of  this
       now happening as the Secretary of  State,  through  Parliament,  has
       expressed with increasing clarity  what  is  considered  to  be  the
       public interest.


   36. None of this, of course, permits  a  violation  of  an  individual's
       human  rights  but  neither  can  the  proportionality  balance   be
       artificially re-adjusted if the public  interest  threshold  is  set
       high by the misapplication of an unduly harsh test in  circumstances
       when it cannot properly be said that the relevant  consequences  are
       unduly harsh.


   37. It was these considerations  that  prompted  me  to  set  aside  the
       decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge on  the  material  that  I
       then had before me.  He was an  appellant  who  was  not  a  British
       citizen and who  had  no  substantive  right  to  remain  under  the
       Immigration Rules.  He had committed a very serious offence - a gang
       robbery of a petrol-filling station netting �14,000 cash - for which
       he had been sentenced, aged 19, to spend  three  years  in  a  Young
       Offender Institution.  He had been in the United  Kingdom  since  he
       was 12.  He was the father of M but did not live with his mother, to
       whom he was  not  married  but  had  substantial  contact  with  his
       daughter.  That brief summary of the basic facts lead me to question
       how the First-tier Tribunal Judge might properly  conclude  that  it
       was unduly harsh on any of the participants  -  the  appellant,  his
       daughter or her mother.


   38. I have now had the opportunity of considering  this  appeal  in  far
       greater depth and hearing the oral evidence  of  the  appellant,  Ms
       President and the appellant's mother  as  well  as  looking  at  the
       documentary evidence, including medical  evidence  affecting  M.   I
       shall now consider that material in greater detail.


   39. I can now so well understand how the First-tier Tribunal Judge  came
       to the conclusion that she did.  I felt great sympathy for all those
       concerned.  The appellant's efforts to turn himself around, the  low
       risk he presents of  further  offending,  his  pleasant  manner;  Ms
       President, expressing in simple terms,  why  she  did  not  want  to
       marry; the effort she is putting into developing her career and  the
       complex arrangements necessary whilst, for the next  two  years  she
       tries to manage  her  degree  course  and  the  responsibilities  of
       looking after M.  The bond that exists between the appellant  and  M
       and the emotional and physical support and care she is  provided  by
       him. Were sympathy sufficient, the appeal would succeed  as  it  has
       done before.  However, whilst in the course of  the  hearing  I  was
       engaged in the process of  sympathising  with  the  participants,  I
       struggled in the course of the hearing to see how the situation  was
       unduly harsh.


   40. First, I was concerned that, in most circumstances,  the  commission
       of such a serious offence  by  a  non-national  who  was  liable  to
       deportation renders removal proportionate.  The fact  that  such  an
       appellant might be a married man living with his wife  and  children
       would not, normally, prevent his removal.  That is the common effect
       of  deportation.   Was  the  appellant's   situation   substantially
       different, albeit he was not married to his partner and  they  lived
       in separate accommodation, although spending much time together.   M
       has a medical condition but it is not life-threatening and  will  be
       managed.  No-one is suggesting that she will be forced to leave  the
       United Kingdom and the unequivocal evidence of her  mother  is  that
       she will not do so.  Their support-network is  United  Kingdom-based
       and M is under the care of one of the greatest  Children's  Hospital
       in the world.


   41. Second, the circumstances of this case generate sympathy,  in  part,
       by the fact that  those  concerned  are  well-educated,  articulate,
       competent and engaging. I do not suggest they are wealthy  but  they
       live in a world of values  and  aspirations,  shared  by  many  and,
       regarded by society, as  commendable.   I  would  wish  to  distance
       myself from reaching a conclusion that  the  consequences  for  them
       will be unduly harsh but would not be for  a  family  poor-educated,
       operating on the fringe of society, who may well feel the same sense
       of impending loss but cannot as well articulate it.


   42. In the course of argument, I suggested whether society might benefit
       more by this appellant remaining in the United Kingdom; his  getting
       a job; for her, the completion of her studies and obtaining work  in
       the health service; securing the couple's partnership, bringing up M
       together, paying taxes and living the  roseate  life  of  a  nuclear
       family.  Compare this with  the  disadvantages  of  being  a  single
       mother.   However, the same applies in almost all  such  cases  and,
       importantly, it  fails  to  take  into  account  the  importance  of
       reflecting  the  public  interest  in  the  treatment   of   foreign
       criminals: Parliament has to  a  significant  degree  abandoned  the
       model of preserving family life at all costs and has elected a model
       which is harsher even to the point of hitting the public  purse  but
       such a course is permissible by operation of statute, providing,  of
       course, it is not unduly  harsh,  unreasonable  or  disproportionate
       resulting in a violation of the human rights of those affected.

MM (Uganda) & Anor v Secretary of State for the Home Department as  part  of
the analysis

   43. In MM (Uganda) & Anor v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department
       [2016] EWCA Civ 617 (20 April 2016), Laws LJ with  whom  the  others
       agreed gave the judgment of  the  Court.   The  Upper  Tribunal  had
       stated at the outset of its determination that the  question  to  be
       decided was the proper construction of the phrase "unduly harsh"  in
       section 117C of the 2003 Act and  paragraph  399  of  the  Rules  as
       amended:
          ...In particular, when carrying out an assessment  as  to  whether
         the impact upon a qualifying child or partner will be unduly harsh,
         should that assessment  be  informed  by  the  seriousness  of  the
         offence committed by the foreign criminal facing deportation or  is
         that assessment focused entirely upon the impact upon the  innocent
         family member, with no reference whatsoever to the  seriousness  of
         the offence?
   44. The view that the assessment should altogether leave out of  account
       the gravity of the foreign criminal's offence was taken by the Upper
       Tribunal in MAB (USA) [2015] UKUT 435. The  Upper  Tribunal  in  KMO
       (section 117 - unduly harsh) Nigeria [2015] UKUT 00543 (IAC) however
       disagreed, giving full reasons  (paragraphs  8  to  23).  The  Upper
       Tribunal concluded in KMO:
          46. ... As I do not adopt the MAB approach, the claimant  has  not
         established that the impact of deportation upon his children  would
         be unduly harsh and so paragraph 399 does not  apply.  It  has  not
         been suggested  that  para  399A  applies.  Therefore,  the  public
         interest in his  deportation  will  only  be  outweighed  by  other
         factors where there are  very  compelling  circumstances  over  and
         above those described on para 399. The only such matter  identified
         that has not already been had regard to is that  the  claimant  has
         now lived in the United Kingdom for  a  very  long  time,  some  28
         years. But that period of stay has  been  unlawful  from  start  to
         finish and so little weight  can  be  given  to  any  private  life
         established  and  there  is  nothing  that  comes  even  close   to
         displacing the public interest arguments.
   45. Law LJ stated that the phrase 'unduly harsh' plainly meant the  same
       in section 117C(5) as in Rule 399. 'Unduly harsh'  was  an  ordinary
       English expression but, as so often, coloured by  its  context.  The
       context emphasised two factors,  (1)  the  public  interest  in  the
       removal of foreign criminals and (2) the need  for  a  proportionate
       assessment of any interference with  Article  8  rights.  The  Upper
       Tribunal's approach in MAB ignored the combination of these  factors
       notwithstanding the fact that the public interest in the removal  of
       foreign criminals was expressly vouched by Parliament in s.  117C(1)
       and more particularly, s. 117C(2) that:
          The more serious the offence committed by a foreign criminal,  the
         greater is the public interest in deportation of the criminal.
   46. This  steered  tribunals  and  the  court  towards  a  proportionate
       assessment  of  the  criminal's  deportation  in  any  given   case.
       Accordingly the more pressing the public interest  in  his  removal,
       the harder it would be to show that  the  effect  on  his  child  or
       partner would be unduly harsh. However the term 'unduly' must not be
       mistaken for 'excessive' which imports a different idea:


         What is due or undue depends on all the circumstances, not  merely
         the impact on the child or  partner  in  the  given  case.  In  the
         present  context  relevant  circumstances  certainly  include   the
         criminal's immigration and criminal history.


   47. For these reasons the Court of Appeal concluded in paragraph 25 that
       MAB was wrongly decided by  the  Tribunal.  The  expression  'unduly
       harsh' in section 117C(5) and Rule 399(a) and (b) requires regard to
       be had to all the circumstances including the criminal's immigration
       and criminal history.

Conclusion


   48. As I have already pointed out, the circumstances of this family are,
       as they are in every case, unique but the  broad  summary  of  their
       situation is not significantly different from many others.  They are
       a family unit which will suffer the effects of  but  if  this  alone
       were the criteria for a prohibition against  removal,  most  foreign
       criminals would be entitled to remain by reason  only  of  having  a
       family in the United Kingdom that cannot reasonably travel with them
       to the offender's destination.  I accept that the appellant has  not
       be-offended since his original conviction.  The risk of re-offending
       is a relevant criterion but, taken alone or out of context, fails to
       recognise that the public interest is not simply a  risk  limitation
       exercise but encompasses a wider public interest that, according  to
       the statute and the rules, emphasises the weight to be  accorded  to
       removal when offences are committed that are  particularly  serious.
       I also accept that the conviction took  place  when  the  appellant,
       although an adult, was significantly younger and less mature.  There
       is no evidence that he continues to keep  company  with  his  fellow
       offenders.  Nevertheless, the offence was so serious as to  merit  a
       substantial period in detention. These considerations also play into
       the significance of the time  that  has  passed  since  the  offence
       itself.  However, this has not been occasioned by culpability on the
       part of the Secretary of State in pursuing the appellant's  removal.
       The delay has been the result of the  time  taken  to  consider  the
       appellant's applications for further leave to remain, the associated
       appeals and the need to re-make the decisions.


   49. The conclusion I have reached, and I do so conscious of  the  effect
       that this will have on the  family,  is  that  the  removal  of  the
       appellant is the proportionate outcome of the commission of a single
       serious offence.  It cannot be  said  that  this  is  unduly  harsh,
       unreasonable or disproportionate  notwithstanding  the  effect  that
       this has on all  of  the  individuals  intimately  involved  in  the
       outcome of this appeal and, in particular, his daughter M.   Rather,
       it  is  the  recognition  that  certain  types  of  behaviour   have
       consequences  both  for  the  individual  and  his  family.    Those
       consequences  cannot  be  avoided  unless  the  severity  of   those
       consequences - their harshness - bears no proportion to  the  nature
       of the offending and  thereby  becomes  unduly  harsh.   The  public
       interest in removing a non-national who commits a  serious  offence,
       as reflected in the material that we have about it,  is  legitimate;
       its effect is inevitably harsh but cannot properly be classified  as
       unduly harsh.  In essence, the  effect  is  both  proportionate  and
       reasonable.   This takes into account  the  effect  upon  M  and  Ms
       President and, indeed, upon the appellant's mother.  It  also  takes
       into  account  the  appellant's  conduct  since  this  offence   was
       committed and the consequent effect this has on the public  interest
       in his removal.

DECISION

 1. I allow the appeal of the Secretary of State against  the  decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal.
 2. The First-tier Tribunal made a material error on a point of law  and  I
    set it aside.
 3. I re-make the decision, dismissing the appeal of Mr Smith  against  the
    decision of the Secretary of State to  decide  to  make  a  deportation
    order.

                                                 JUDGE OF THE UPPER TRIBUNAL
                                                               7 August 2017
                                  Appendix


                     REASONS FOR FINDING AN ERROR OF LAW


 1. This is the first stage of an appeal made by the Secretary of State  in
    a case where the respondent is Mr Smith.  I shall refer to Mr Smith  as
    the appellant as he was in the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The Secretary of State seeks to appeal on the basis that the First-tier
    Tribunal Judge erred in permitting  the  applicant  to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom on human rights grounds.  It is not necessary for me  to
    say any more than what I  said  in  January  of  2017  when  I  granted
    permission.  What I  had  in  mind  was  often  the  facts  speak  more
    eloquently than a recital of legal principles  and  in  this  case  the
    appellant was  the  driver  of  a  switch  vehicle  which  he  and  his
    associates had agreed to use in a robbery which targeted  a  BP  garage
    and which netted �14,000.  He was sentenced to three years in custody.

 3. There is obviously a clear case for the public interest being  operated
    in favour of his removal notwithstanding the fact that he had  remained
    in the United Kingdom for the previous ten years.  At that  time  there
    was before the judge evidence that the appellant did not live with  the
    mother OF his daughter, who was then aged 4.  The daughter  was  looked
    after principally by the mother and the judge went on to find that  the
    parents  were  not  in  a  subsisting  relationship  although  it   was
    apparently the case that there was an order made in  the  County  Court
    that the appellant should have contact rights with his daughter.

 4.  In  those  circumstances  it  might  be  difficult  to  see  how   the
    circumstances of this case were of a type which permitted the operation
    of Article 8 to render the appellant's removal unlawful.   The  judge's
    approach to the question of the proportionality balance  was  that  the
    appellant had submitted that it would be unduly harsh for his  daughter
    to live in Barbados and  the  judge  considered  that  the  appellant's
    daughter, as a British citizen, was somebody who could not be  required
    to leave the United Kingdom and that the application should be  treated
    on the basis that the daughter should remain in the United Kingdom.

 5. It was in the best interests of the appellant's  daughter  for  her  to
    remain in the care of her mother and not to be removed.  That  was  the
    basis on which the First-tier Tribunal Judge moved on  to  conclude  as
    the next step that the circumstances were such that this prevented  the
    appellant from being removed.  In fact, the  latter  step  was  a  non-
    sequitur; it does not follow from the former.  I am bound to say that I
    do not understand the basis upon which the judge reached the conclusion
    he did.  The judge's reasoning would only hold good if, in every  case,
    the presence of a British child in the  United  Kingdom  prevented  the
    removal of the child's parent.  For this reason I find that there was a
    material error of law.

 6. That does not of course conclude the consideration of this case because
    there will be an opportunity for  the  appellant  to  advance  whatever
    additional material he might wish to do so  in  order  to  say  why  he
    should not be removed.  In  particular  he  referred  to  some  medical
    considerations and the need for continuous therapy.

 7. He also submitted that the mother is studying dentistry  at  Birmingham
    University as a result of which  the  father,  with  assistance,  looks
    after the child full-time and there  is  also  consideration  that  the
    couple will be moving in to live  together.   Those  were  not  matters
    which were before the judge, who dealt with the matter on a  very  much
    more limited basis.  In these circumstances I am not  going  to  remake
    the decision this afternoon but I am going to find  that  there  was  a
    material error of law and that the matter will have to be remade.
