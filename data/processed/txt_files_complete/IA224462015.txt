                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Appellant's  appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge R H Walters promulgated on 18th July 2016 in which Judge
    Walters dismissed the Appellant's appeal  both  under  the  Immigration
    Rules and on human rights grounds.

 2. The Appellant has now sought to appeal against that  decision  for  the
    reasons set out within the Grounds of  Appeal.   Those  grounds  are  a
    matter of record and therefore I do not intend to repeat them  verbatim
    here. However, in summary within the  first  Ground  of  Appeal  it  is
    argued that the judge has misdirected himself in law in  terms  of  his
    findings at paragraph 41 that the Appellant had not been  living  in  a
    relationship akin to marriage with Ms Ayoola, as he remained married to
    Mrs Adenuga.  It is argued that the judge erred in that regard and  the
    fact that someone can be in a relationship akin to  marriage,  even  if
    they are not actually divorced and that all that is  required  is  that
    the previous relationship of the Applicant and their  previous  partner
    has permanently broken down.

 3. Within the second Ground of Appeal the judge's findings in  respect  of
    paragraph 276ADE are challenged as to whether or not the Appellant  had
    been continuously resident in the UK for at least twenty  years  for  a
    period between 1st April 1995 and 1st April 2015.  It is argued  within
    the Grounds of  Appeal  that  the  judge  had  not  accepted  that  the
    Appellant had lived continuously in the UK  for  that  period.   It  is
    stated the Tribunal had  not  accepted  that  the  witnesses  who  gave
    evidence  in  support  had  been  seeing  the  Appellant   sufficiently
    regularly over the period to be able to support a finding that  he  had
    been in the UK since the 1990s.  A schedule of documentary evidence was
    attached to show the gaps in the period of time when the Appellant  had
    been out of the UK and it is argued that the  Tribunal  has  failed  to
    give any or any adequate reasons as to why the evidence of  Mr  Olowoyo
    was not accepted, who said that he had seen the  Appellant  on  average
    every two weeks.

 4. Within the third Ground of Appeal it is argued that there is  a  flawed
    assessment under Article 8 of the ECHR on the basis that the judge  has
    not considered whether or not it is proportionate to expect  Ms  Ayoola
    to accompany  the  Appellant  to  Nigeria  or  whether  or  not  it  is
    reasonable in fact to require him to  make  an  application  for  entry
    clearance from Nigeria as a spouse/fiancï¿½ of Ms  Ayoola,  once  he  has
    divorced Mrs Adenuga. It is argued there was no consideration as to the
    effect that would have on Ms Ayoola.

 5. In the fourth Ground of Appeal it is argued  that  the  judge  made  an
    erroneous finding in regards to paragraph 322 of the Immigration  Rules
    regarding a previous finding from Deputy Upper Tribunal  Judge  Parkes.
    The Appellant has previously submitted false  documents  in  connection
    with an immigration application and the judge's finding under paragraph
    322 still applied to the  present  appeal  such  that  the  Appellant's
    application should have been refused.

 6. Permission to appeal in  this  case  had  been  granted  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Farrelly on 25th July 2017 who found that there  was  an
    arguable error  of  law  in  relation  to  the  judge's  conclusion  at
    paragraph 41 that the Appellant was  not  in  a  relationship  akin  to
    marriage as he remained married to another person.  He goes on  to  say
    that the challenge to the  judge's  findings  regarding  the  20  years
    residence was arguable.

 7. I am also grateful to the oral submissions of Ms  Heybroek  of  Counsel
    and  also  the  oral  submissions  of  Mr  Tufan,  Senior  Home  Office
    Presenting Officer on behalf of the Secretary of State.

 8. In respect of the first Ground of Appeal, looking at  the  decision  of
    the  Learned  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  at  paragraph  41  he  found
    specifically that the Appellant had not been living in  a  relationship
    akin to marriage with Ms Ayoola as he remained married to Mrs  Adenuga.
    In his findings previously the judge  stated  that  the  Appellant  had
    first met Ms Ayoola in 1998 in his oral evidence when he was here on  a
    visit visa and subsequently returned to Nigeria, but Ms  Ayoola  became
    pregnant and then he returned to the UK after a short period in Nigeria
    and stated that he had lost contact with Ms Ayoola until they met again
    in 1989, by which time  she  had  already  given  birth  to  their  son
    Solomon.  That is at paragraph 32 of the judgment.

 9. The judge went on to note in paragraph 33 that on 26th October 1990 the
    Appellant had married Mrs Adenuga  in  the  Hackney  Marriage  Registry
    Office and that he and Mrs Adenuga had  actually  then  separated  some
    time in 1995 and goes on to find that in 1999  the  Appellant  reunited
    with Ms Ayoola and moved in with her at [         ], having lived  with
    her and their child S in those premises and  all  three  of  them  then
    moved to [               ], which was then said  to  be  their  present
    address.  The judge noted that the present application was made on  1st
    April 2015 and the Appellant had to prove that he  had  lived  with  Ms
    Ayoola in a relationship akin to marriage between 1st  April  2013  and
    1st April 2015.  The judge at paragraph 38 found that  medical  records
    for the relevant period showed that the Appellant  was  residing  at  [
          ] and there being also copies  of  medical  records  showing  the
    Appellant's address from 2012 said to be shown as [                  ].
     He also noted there was said to be a letter regarding an NHS eye  test
    sent to him at [             ].  From  that  documentary  evidence  the
    judge accepted that  during  this  period  he  had  been  living  at  [
                ].

10. However, the judge went on to make his finding at paragraph 41  he  did
    not accept that he had been living with Ms  Ayoola  in  a  relationship
    akin to marriage because  he  remained  married  to  Mrs  Adenuga.   In
    paragraph 42 he stated that  the  Appellant's  evidence  was  that  Mrs
    Adenuga and their child are now at some unknown place  in  Nigeria,  so
    the Appellant cannot therefore divorce her.

11. In that regard Mr Tufan  quite  correctly  conceded  that  the  Judge's
    finding that the appellant had to be divorced before he could be  in  a
    relationship akin to marriage with another woman is wrong.  I find that
    someone can be living in a relationship akin to marriage even  if  they
    remained married.  Ultimately, as Ms Heybroek argues, the ultimate test
    is whether or not the relationship  with  their  previous  partner  had
    broken down irretrievably during that period.  In this case  we  had  a
    situation whereby on the findings of the judge  himself  the  Appellant
    and Mrs Adenuga with whom he is married separated sometime in 1995.  He
    was actually reunited with Ms Ayoola back in 1999  and  seems  to  have
    lived, on his case, with her, since 1999.  His case was that as far  as
    his wife was concerned she was now at some unknown address in  Nigeria,
    but certainly he was not in a relationship with her.  Mr Tufan has  not
    been able to point me to any known case in which  it  has  been  argued
    that you have to be divorced before you can be in a  relationship  akin
    to marriage.

12. In terms of materiality that links in also with the  fourth  Ground  of
    Appeal in which it is argued that at paragraph 77 the judge found  that
    paragraph 322 of the Immigration Rules still  applied  because  of  the
    finding of DUT J Parkes that the  Appellant  had  previously  submitted
    false documents in connection with an immigration application.  It  was
    argued by Ms Heybroek  Counsel  in  fact  that  was  not  part  of  the
    reasoning relied upon by the Secretary of State in the  refusal  notice
    and in that regard Mr Tufan accepts that it was not  actually  part  of
    the decision of the Secretary of State. He seeks to argue that in terms
    of materiality the judge had  accepted  that  the  Appellant  had  been
    living in a relationship akin to marriage with Ms Ayoola  but  then  in
    fact  had  gone  on  to  consider  the  suitability   and   eligibility
    requirements for leave to remain as  a  partner.   In  that  regard  he
    referred me to the provisions of the suitability requirements for leave
    to remain under paragraph 4.2 as to  whether  the  applicant  had  made
    false representations or failed to disclose any material facts  in  the
    previous application for leave to enter or variation of leave  or  your
    previous human rights claim or did so  in  order  to  obtain  from  the
    Secretary of State or third party  documents  required  to  support  an
    application or claim, whether or not the claim was successful.

13. In that regard, the Appellant will then still need to show that he  met
    the requirements of the Immigration Rules and obviously in that  regard
    there may be a consideration as to whether or  not  the  Appellant  did
    meet the requirements of the Rules in that regard, given  the  previous
    findings of Upper Tribunal Judge Parkes  he  had  previously  submitted
    false documents.  As Mr Tufan submits, whether not the Rules are met is
    a relevant consideration in a human rights appeal.  There  still  would
    have to be a consideration as to whether or  not  there  would  be  any
    compelling or exceptional circumstances such as to justify leave  being
    granted outside of the Rules.  The judge actually has not  gone  on  to
    consider whether the suitability requirements were met  or  whether  in
    fact that was challenged within the refusal notice by the Secretary  of
    State.  It was not seemingly challenged within the  refusal  notice  as
    being a reason for refusal.

14. The Judge has clearly used his finding that the appellant and Ms Ayoola
    were not partners as the appellant was not divorced from his  wife,  as
    being his reasoning as to why the Immigration Rules were  not  met  and
    has also seemingly come to the view that basically the Appellant should
    be returning back to his home country to make an application for  leave
    to enter once he had become divorced.  Clearly again  that  is  on  the
    misapprehension as to the basis of the fact that she does not  need  to
    be divorc3ed in order to be a partner and in a durable relationship.

15. In those circumstances I cannot say that the decision of the  judge  in
    respect of Article 8 would necessarily have been the same had the judge
    properly considered whether or not the relationship that  he  had  with
    his partner was a durable  relationship  and  a  relationship  akin  to
    marriage such as to mean that they were partners for  the  purposes  of
    the Immigration Rules and also whether that has affected  his  findings
    both in terms of consideration of the Rules and  also  outside  of  the
    Rules.  I therefore do find that the  judge's  error  in  paragraph  41
    regarding the fact that he is not in a relationship  akin  to  marriage
    with Ms Ayoola as he remains married to Mrs Adenuga is a material error
    of law.

16. In respect of the second Ground of Appeal  regarding  the  findings  of
    paragraph 276ADE although it is argued in that regard  by  Ms  Heybroek
    and also within the Grounds of Appeal that the judge has not adequately
    or at all given reasons as to why the evidence of Mr Olowoyo should  be
    rejected when one looks at the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge.  In that regard the judge referred to the evidence of Mr Olowoyo
    at paragraph 52 of  the  judgment  and  said  that  he  had  known  the
    Appellant for 24 years, that they had first met  in  a  restaurant  and
    that they see each other once every two weeks on average.  He had never
    been to the Appellant's home.  He first met Ms Ayoola about six  months
    previously.

17. In that regard the judge then went on to find in respect of not only Ms
    Ayoola but the other witnesses as well, that could not say any of these
    witnesses could be regarded as close friends of the  Appellant  and  Ms
    Ayoola and that none appeared  to  be  aware  the  Appellant  had  been
    married and lived with Mrs Adenuga for about five years and nor did any
    of the witnesses appear to have any clear idea how long Ms  Ayoola  was
    married to Mr Bramble, her previous partner.  The judge  at  paragraphs
    60 and 61 then said in 61, "if they were in such constant contact  with
    the Appellant as they alleged, I could not comprehend how they could be
    ignorant to these matters".  He went on at paragraph 62:

         "In  conclusion,  I  did  not   find   that   the   Appellant   has
         satisfactorily proved that he has lived continuously in the UK  for
         at least 20 years.  I  accept  that  he  has  provided  documentary
         evidence which proves that he was present in the  UK  for  some  of
         that  period,  but  it  is  not  sufficient  to  prove   continuous
         residence."

18. In that regard I find that in fact the judge has given clear,  adequate
    and sufficient reasons for rejecting  the  evidence  of  the  witnesses
    regarding the extent to which they, both  Ms  Ayoola  and  Mrs  Adenuga
    could say that the Appellant has been continuously present  in  the  UK
    for a period of twenty years.  The judge has adequately dealt with that
    issue.  I therefore do not accept that Ground of Appeal.

19. However, for the reasons that I previously enunciated, I do  find  that
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge does contain  a  material
    error of law and that the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Walters
    should be set aside.

    Notice of Decision

    The decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Walters  does  contain  a
    material error of law and is set aside with no  preserved  findings  of
    fact.  The matter I find should be  remitted  back  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal for re-hearing before any First-tier Tribunal Judge other than
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Walters.

    No anonymity direction was made  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  no
    application for any  anonymity  order  has  been  made  before  me.   I
    therefore do not make any anonymity direction in this case.
