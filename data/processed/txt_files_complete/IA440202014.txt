Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr P Nath, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr J Waithe, Counsel instructed by Malik Law
Chambers
      Solicitors (Bethnal Green Road)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The application for permission to appeal was made by the  Secretary  of
    State but nonetheless for the purposes of this decision I will refer to
    Mrs Mohammed as the  appellant  and  the  Secretary  of  State  as  the
    respondent.

 2. An application for permission to appeal was granted to the Secretary of
    State against the decision of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Cohen  dated
    25th January 2016 in which he allowed the appeal  of  Mrs  Mohammed,  a
    citizen of India born on 28th September 1980 against  the  decision  of
    the Secretary of State dated 21st October 2014 to refuse  to  vary  her
    leave to remain in the United Kingdom  and  to  give  directions  under
    Section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 for  her
    removal from the UK.  The appellant had entered the United  Kingdom  on
    26th April 2010 as  a  work  permit  dependant.   Her  application  was
    considered under paragraph 284 but was rejected on the basis  that  she
    had  failed  under  paragraph  284(ix)(a)  to  provide  an  appropriate
    original English language test certificate.  She had  provided  an  EMD
    entry level certificate in ESOL which was not a certificate accepted by
    the Secretary of State as specified in Appendix O.

 3. The application was also refused under FM  R-LTRP1.1(d)  on  the  basis
    that the applicant had no child.  Nowhere in the  application  did  the
    appellant refer to the fact that she had a child and the matter was not
    considered under paragraph EX.1.  Her application was refused under  D-
    LTRP.1.3.

 4. Her application was also refused under paragraph 276ADE(1).

 5. When  the  matter  came  before  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Cohen  he
    identified  at  paragraph  3  the  provisions  under  Appendix  FM  and
    paragraph 276ADE whereby the application had  been  refused  but  noted
    that the appellant had not shown  any  evidence  that  there  were  any
    children from a relationship who were under the age of 18 in the UK who
    were British citizens.

 6. The judge noted at paragraph 4  that  the  appellant's  solicitors  had
    referred to the child in the UK as having indefinite  leave  to  remain
    and at paragraph 20 identified that the appellant's child was a British
    citizen.  The judge allowed the appeal outside the Rules on  the  basis
    of Article 8.

 7. The challenge to the judge's determination arose  first  on  the  basis
    that there was a material error of fact as the judge  at  paragraph  20
    found that the appellant's daughter was British and made the assessment
    on Article 8 grounds in the light of this finding.  Secondly he  failed
    to give adequate reasons  as  to  the  public  interest  regarding  the
    retention of a passport of the  appellant  and  for  finding  that  the
    decision was Wednesbury unreasonable  and  thirdly  that  there  was  a
    material misdirection in law at paragraph 23  on  the  basis  that  the
    judge  disclosed  an  error  of  approach  to  Section  117B   of   the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act by suggesting  contrary  to  AM
    (S.117B) Malawi [2015] UKUT 0260 (IAC) that  the  appellant  derived  a
    positive benefit in the Article 8 assessment from  the  fact  that  the
    family were self-supporting and paying tax in the UK.   It  was  argued
    that the reliance  on  Chikwamba  v  SSHD.  [2008]  UKHL  40  was  also
    misplaced.

 8. It is clear that the judge did make an error in assuming that the child
    was a British citizen.  Nowhere was  there  evidence  to  that  effect.
    This finding was factored into  the  Article  8  assessment  in  error.
    Further reliance on the case of Chikwamba was in error.  It  was  clear
    from the application of the Immigration Rules that the appellant  could
    not comply with the production of an appropriate English language test.
     There was indeed  no  indication  that  the  applicant  therefore  had
    complied with the relevant Immigration Rules and there was no  analysis
    of EX.1.  There was  no  indication  that  the  application  for  entry
    clearance at the date of the hearing was bound to succeed.

 9. The judge also materially misdirected himself in law in his approach to
    Section 117 and contrary to AM (S.117B) Malawi [2015] UKUT  0260  (IAC)
    [.  The decision of Judge Cohen was set aside and set for a hearing  to
    remake the decision before me.

10. At the resumed hearing on 6th January 2017 it was clear that despite  a
    direction to serve further evidence, issued in the  previous  error  of
    law decision dated 6th September 2016, no  further  evidence  had  been
    submitted to the Upper Tribunal in compliance with the direction.   The
    court was adjourned  temporarily  whilst  enquiries  were  made  as  to
    whether a further bundle had indeed been submitted  by  the  solicitors
    and it transpired the only further  piece  of  evidence  on  which  the
    solicitors intended to rely was in fact forwarded to  the  Home  Office
    and related to the birth certificate of a further  child  born  to  the
    appellant and her naturalised British husband on  12th  November  2016.
    It was evident that this child has a British citizen passport issued on
    9th December 2016.

11. The documentary evidence before  me  was  that  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal in a bundle submitted to the  Tribunal  on  5th  January  2016
    containing pages 1 to 127.  Also before me was a bundle from  the  Home
    Office which included the decision of the Secretary of State dated 18th
    October 2014.   That  decision  was  based  on  the  premise  that  the
    appellant could not fulfil the requirements of the Immigration Rules as
    the appellant had failed to  submit  an  appropriate  English  language
    certificate and  further  consideration  under  the  Immigration  Rules
    confirmed that the appellant had no children in the UK and did not meet
    the requirements of EX.1.(a).  At the hearing before me  Mr  Waithe  of
    Counsel confirmed that he was not relying on the Immigration Rules  and
    the matter was to be considered with a respect to Article 8  only.   Mr
    Nath concurred.

12. I reiterate that there was no further evidence before me, save for  the
    birth certificate of the second child and the oral  testimony  of  both
    the appellant and her sponsor  husband,  both  of  whom  adopted  their
    witness statements of January 2016.  The  appellant  gave  evidence  in
    Tamil through the assistance of an interpreter and confirmed  that  she
    came together with her daughter to the UK in  2010  on  a  work  permit
    visa.  Her daughter was being educated at the South Park Primary School
    and had made progress there.

13. Under cross-examination she confirmed her husband was still employed by
    O2 at Greenwich working as a chef.  She confirmed that before  she  was
    living at a friend's house but was now living at  7  Wellwood  Road  in
    Ilford where they paid �850 per month for  a  one  bedroom  flat.   Her
    second child was a British  citizen  child  and  her  first  child  had
    indefinite leave to remain.   The  appellant  confirmed  that  she  had
    family in India in the form of her mother and that she  then  confirmed
    that she had a sister also in India.  When asked whether she could live
    with her sister and mother she stated that  she  could  not,  and  when
    asked to explain, she stated that because her husband and  family  were
    in the UK.  She confirmed that if her husband and family were with them
    that would be acceptable.

14. She was asked why she could not make an application for entry clearance
    to return to the UK and she stated because her daughter and  baby  were
    here and she did not wish to be separated from her husband.   She  said
    she could not manage and that her child had breathing problems.

15. The sponsor husband also gave evidence and confirmed that  he  had  now
    obtained British citizenship and produced a passport for  both  himself
    and his second child.  When  asked  as  to  the  impact  on  him  of  a
    temporary separation with his  wife  he  stated  that  there  would  be
    pressure on him and that the cost was very expensive.  He  had  already
    paid solicitors.   His  daughter  was  at  school  and  his  child  had
    breathing problems.  He confirmed that he had lots of friends in the UK
    but no family and that they married in 2006.

16. He had confirmed that he was employed as a chef in O2 and that  now  he
    earned �34,000 a year working  for  38  hours  per  week.   The  family
    receive no benefits and he no longer  sent  money  to  India.   He  was
    planning to buy a house but because of the cost of legal  fees  he  had
    been forced to abandon that hope for the time being.

17. He confirmed that he had a father and mother and siblings and that  his
    father and mother and some of the siblings remained in India.

18. He then stated that his child was in hospital  (in fact the  child  had
    been brought into court and then looked after outside by a friend)  and
    he stated that the child was going to have surgery  but  it  transpired
    the child was going to have an endoscopy.  At first the husband sponsor
    stated that he and his wife had never lived with the wife and sister in
    India and then stated that in fact they had lived together.

19. Mr Nath made submissions to the effect that a temporary separation  was
    reasonable whilst the wife returned to India to  make  an  application.
    There were various considerations under  Section  117.   There  was  no
    reason why the appellant could not return and make an application  from
    abroad.  There was no independent evidence of the health conditions  of
    either the sponsor or the child.  There has been ample time for further
    evidence  to  be  presented  to  the  Tribunal   by   the   appellant's
    representatives and it was for them  to  provide  such  evidence.   The
    appellant could return to India and make an  application  from  abroad.
    There was no documentary evidence as to the claimed  condition  of  the
    child, no documentary evidence as  to  any  medical  condition  of  the
    sponsor husband.  This was merely an attempt at  circumvention  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

20. Mr Waithe submitted that it would  not  be  reasonable  to  expect  the
    appellant to leave the United Kingdom and it would be an  unjustifiable
    interference with her family life.  The cost and  the  length  of  time
    would be a relevant consideration.   This  was  a  wife  of  a  British
    citizen.  The first child had indefinite leave to remain and  had  been
    in the UK for some time.  It would not  be  reasonable  to  expect  the
    hearing to cope with a job and two children  on  his  own  and  it  was
    disproportionate.

Conclusions

21. No further evidence was presented despite my instruction  that  further
    information should be supplied.  Both representatives agreed  that  the
    matter was for consideration in  relation  to  Article  8  outside  the
    Immigration Rules.   Following Singh v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ  74  it  is
    necessary to consider all of  the  circumstances  in  relation  to  any
    Article 8 assessment.  The birth of the  second  child  was  not  given
    consideration by the Secretary of State; nor indeed  the  existence  of
    the first child as she was not declared on the application form.  Since
    the application, the partner  and  father  of  the  children  has  been
    naturalised as British.

22. As such I have proceeded to make an assessment of Article 8 outside the
    Rules the various five stage test in  Razgar  v  SSHD  [2004]  UKHL  27
    should  be  applied.   There  is  no  doubt  that  the  appellant   has
    established a family life with her sponsor and children  and  that  her
    removal would constitute an interference  of  such  gravity  to  engage
    Article 8. Her husband sponsor is now a  naturalised  British  citizen,
    her older child has indefinite leave to remain and  the  younger  child
    born in November and who is just a few months old was  granted  British
    citizenship in December 2016.  The decision, however, by the  Secretary
    of State taken in 2014 under the Immigration Rules was lawful and for a
    legitimate aim, that is, the  protection  of  rights  and  freedoms  of
    others through immigration control.

23. I turn to the proportionality assessment. It is useful to set  out  the
    background and relevant immigration rules which, following SS  Congo  v
    SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 317 must feature in such an assessment; the  rules
    set out the position of the Secretary of State  and  according  to  the
    Secretary of State the balance to be struck. The refusal letter of  the
    Secretary of State had rejected  the  appellant's  application  on  the
    basis that she had failed to  provide  the  relevant  English  language
    certificate further to paragraph 284(ix)(b) and she  had  not  provided
    evidence to show she had an academic  qualification  recognised  by  UK
    NARIC equivalent to the standard of a Bachelors or  Masters  Degree  or
    PhD in the UK which was taught in English.  She did not qualify for any
    of the exemptions and  therefore  did  not  meet  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 284(ix).

24. In refusing the application  consideration  was  nonetheless  given  to
    family life under Article 8 and in particular Appendix FM EX.1. of  the
    Rules.  The requirements of Appendix FM R-LTRP.1.1.(d) are that:

      i) the applicant must not fall for refusal  under  S-LTR:  Suitability
         leave to remain; and

     ii) the applicant meets the requirements  of  paragraphs  E-LTRPT.1.2.-
         1.12. and E-LTRPT.2.1.; and

    iii) paragraph EX.1. applies.

25. Paragraph EX.1. applies if:

          i) (i) the  applicant  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
             relationship with a child who -

             (a) is under the age of 18 years, or was under the age  of  18
                  years when the applicant was first granted  leave  on  the
                  basis that this paragraph applied;

             (b) is in the UK;

             (c) is a British citizen or has lived in the  UK  continuously
                  for at least the seven  years  immediately  preceding  the
                  date of the application; and

         (ii)     it would not be reasonable to expect the  child  to  leave
             the UK; or

     ii) the applicant has a genuine  and  subsisting  relationship  with  a
         partner who is in the UK and is a British citizen settled in the UK
         or in the UK with refugee leave  or  humanitarian  protection,  and
         there are insurmountable obstacles to family life with that partner
         continuing outside the UK.

 1. Mr Waithe did not argue that there were insurmountable obstacles to the
    sponsor husband relocating with the appellant, and Mr  Waithe  did  not
    contend that the appellant could comply  with  the  Immigration  Rules,
    that is R-LTRP; the appellant and her partner are in the UK and she has
    made a valid application for leave to remain as a partner. She does not
    fall for refusal under the suitability requirements.   She  also  meets
    the requirements of E-LTRP 1.2 -2.12 and E-LTRP.2.1.  The question  now
    after the birth of the British citizen child is whether paragraph  EX.1
    applies. I have set out EX.1 above for clarity.

 2. Further to EX.1 (b) the appellant does have a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship with a partner who is in the UK and is a British  citizen,
    settled in the UK.   Would there now  be  insurmountable  obstacles  to
    family life with that partner continuing outside the UK?

 3. EX.2 states that for the purposes of paragraph EX.1.(b) 'insurmountable
    obstacles' means the very significant difficulties which would be faced
    not just by the appellant but also by their partner in continuing their
    family life outside the UK and which could not  be  overcome  or  would
    entail very serious hardship  for  the  applicant  or  their  partner..
    Further to  Sanade (British children - Zambrano - Dereci)  [2012]  UKUT
    00048 (IAC),  'where the child or indeed  the  remaining  spouse  is  a
    British citizen and therefore a citizen of the European  Union,  it  is
    not possible to require them to relocate outside of the European  Union
    or to submit that it would be reasonable for them to do so'.   That  is
    not the same as finding 'insurmountable obstacles'.  This is  a  family
    who have hitherto lived in  India  and  although  I  accept  they  have
    employment and children in the UK it is not clear that they would  face
    very serious hardship should they relocate. As stated in ZH Tanzania

         'The fact of British citizenship does not  trump  everything  else.
         But it will hardly ever be less than a very significant and weighty
         factor against moving children who  have  that  status  to  another
         country with a parent who has no right to remain  here,  especially
         if the effect of doing this is that they will inevitably lose those
         benefits and advantages for the rest of their childhood'.

 4.  Even  thought  the  nature  of  the  child's  British  and  indeed  EU
    citizenship may be weighty I cannot classify it as  an  'insurmountable
    obstacle'.  There is no bar to the family's entry to  India  and  there
    was no evidence the family  will  face  serious  hardship  there.   The
    Secretary of State's Immigration Directorate Instructions  August  2015
    analyses the approach to be taken  to  'insurmountable  obstacles'  and
    sets out as follows

          'When  assessing  an  application  under  paragraph  EX.1.(b)  and
         determining  whether  there  are  "insurmountable  obstacles",  the
         decision maker should have regard to the  individual  circumstances
         of the applicant and their partner, based on  all  the  information
         that has been provided.

         The assessment of whether there are "insurmountable obstacles" is a
         different and more stringent assessment than whether  it  would  be
         "reasonable  to  expect"  the  applicant's  partner  to  join  them
         overseas. For example, a British Citizen partner who has  lived  in
         the UK all their life, has friends and family here, works here  and
         speaks only English may not wish to  uproot  and  relocate  halfway
         across the world, and it may be very difficult for them to  do  so,
         but a significant degree of  hardship  or  inconvenience  does  not
         amount to an insurmountable  obstacle.  ECHR  Article  8  does  not
         oblige the UK to accept the choice of a couple as to which  country
         they would prefer to reside in'.

    The assessment of whether family life can continue overseas, under  the
    immigration rules, does not depend upon the  test  of  'reasonableness'
    but on the 'insurmountable obstacles' test or very serious hardship.  I
    do not accept that is made  out  with  respect  to  the  partner.   The
    British or EU citizenship of the father or the younger  child  are  not
    'insurmountable obstacles'.  There is no obligation on the UK to accept
    the choice of a couple as to where they wish to reside.  It is open  to
    the father to remain in the UK with his children or  remove  to  India.
    There is no requirement for the children to depart as it is open to the
    appellant to return to India to make an entry clearance application  to
    return.  There was no submission that EX.1  (a)  should  apply  to  the
    partner route.

 5. Nor can the applicant comply with the requirements for limited leave to
    remain as a parent, which was not considered by the Secretary of  State
    because the applicant on her application form did not declare that  she
    had a child with the sponsor. Under R-LTRPT the requirements for  leave
    to remain as a parent are as follows:

    (d)    (i)   the applicant must  not  fall  for  refusal  under  S-LTR:
             Suitability leave to remain; and

      (ii) the applicant meets the requirements of paragraphs  E-LTRPT.2.2-
             2.4. and E-LTRPT.3.1-3.2.; and

      (iii)      paragraph EX.1. applies.

 6. Under paragraph E-LTRPT.2.2. the older child has not lived  in  the  UK
    continuously for at  least  seven  years  preceding  the  date  of  the
    application.  The application was made  on  17th  April  2014  and  the
    applicant confirmed that she entered with the older child in 2010.   In
    respect of the British citizen child, further to E-LTRPT.2.3. either:

      i) the applicant must have sole parental responsibility for the  child
         or the child normally lives with the applicant and not their  other
         parent (who is a British Citizen or settled in  the  UK),  and  the
         applicant must not be eligible to apply for leave to  remain  as  a
         partner under this Appendix; or

     ii) the parent or carer with whom the child normally lives must be-

          i) a British Citizen in the UK or settled in the UK;

         ii) not the partner of the applicant (which here includes a person
             who has been in a relationship with  the  applicant  for  less
             than two years prior to the date of application); and

        iii) the applicant must not be  eligible  to  apply  for  leave  to
             remain as a partner under this Appendix.

    The appellant does not have sole responsibility for the British citizen
    child as the father is a British citizen in the UK and she is also  the
    partner of the applicant; further the applicant is  eligible  to  apply
    for leave to remain as a partner under the Appendix.

 7. These are the requirements that must be fulfilled prior to EX.1.  being
    applied.  EX.1 (a) is in relation to a child, and does not apply as the
    father is able to remain in the UK to care for the child.

 8. It was not argued before  me  by  the  appellant's  counsel  that  that
    Paragraph 276ADE applied.

 9. As can be seen from the oral evidence the husband at one point told  me
    that the younger child was hospitalised but it was clear that the child
    was outside the hearing room.  The husband stated that the child needed
    surgery and then  stated  an  endoscopy  was  needed.   No  documentary
    evidence to that effect was provided.  Both the husband and  wife  have
    relatives  in  India  and  the  husband,  despite  an  initial  denial,
    confirmed that he had previously lived in India  with  the  appellant's
    mother and sister.  This, once again, was  a  change  in  his  evidence
    because immediately prior to that statement he maintained that  he  had
    never lived with them.  I asked specifically why  the  appellant  could
    not return on a temporary basis to make an entry clearance  application
    and the husband stated that he had high blood pressure, there would  be
    too much pressure on him and it would be expensive for the  family.   I
    do not consider that those are good reasons.

10. Having made an analysis under the Immigration Rules and  which  I  take
    into account as setting out the position  of  the  Secretary  of  State
    under Article 8.  I have taken into account the rights of the  husband,
    but am not persuaded that it would be disproportionate for a  temporary
    separation to occur whilst his wife complied with the Immigration Rules
    which must apply to the appellant as to everyone else.   Article  8  is
    not designed to circumvent the Immigration Rules.

11. I must, however, as a primary consideration consider the best interests
    of the  children  and  I  take  into  account  Azimi-Moayed  (decisions
    affecting children onward appeals) [2013] UKUT  197  (IAC).   The  best
    interests of the children are to remain with  their  mother  and  their
    father in one family unit.  I take into account that the elder child is
    at school and is entitled to remain at her school without interruption.
     The younger child is being cared for by the mother at home  and  is  a
    British citizen. That said, there is no expectation that  either  child
    would be required to leave the UK. Although I was told by  the  parents
    that the younger child had health issues that was not supported by  any
    documentary evidence.  It may open to the family, if the mother wishes,
    to take the smaller child with her to  India  whilst  she  applies  for
    entry clearance to return whilst the child is small.  The child  is  so
    young that  it  is  unlikely  that  he  would  even  be  aware  of  his
    surroundings.   I do accept however that it is  common  sense  that  to
    remove a very young child of this age on a long flight would not be  in
    the child's best interests. There was  no  indication  that  the  older
    child had  any  special  needs  or  health  issues  at  all.   She  has
    Indefinite Leave to Remain and has been in school in the UK since  2010
    when she entered the UK. She is said to be progressing and  settled  at
    her primary school. Removal from school would no doubt be a  disruptive
    event. The best interests of the children are a primary factor but  not
    an overriding factor and I must take  into  account  the  wider  public
    interest considerations.

12. The father maintained that he would find it very difficult to  continue
    to maintain the older child's attendance at school and although  it  is
    possible that the father could take charge as any single  parent  might
    be expected to do, I accept it would, aside from work, be difficult for
    him.  If the parents do not wish the younger child  to  be  removed  it
    would also be difficult for the father to care for the younger child. I
    considered the possibility that the younger  child  may  accompany  the
    mother to India for the period of her application but concluded that it
    would not be in the child's best interests.

13. I am also enjoined to take into account Section 117B of the Nationality
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002

         "117B Article 8: public interest considerations applicable  in  all
                cases:

         (1)      The maintenance of effective immigration  controls  is  in
             the public interest.

         (2)      It is in the public interest, and  in  particular  in  the
             interests of the economic well-being of  the  United  Kingdom,
             that persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom
             are able to speak  English,  because  persons  who  can  speak
             English -

            (a)   are less of a burden on taxpayers, and

            (b)   are better able to integrate into society.

         (3)      It is in the public interest, and  in  particular  in  the
             interests of the economic well-being of  the  United  Kingdom,
             that persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom
             are financially independent, because such persons -

            (a)   are not a burden on taxpayers, and

            (b)   are better able to integrate into society.

         (4)      Little weight should be given to-

            (a)   a private life, or

            (b)   a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,  that  is
                  established by a person at a time when the  person  is  in
                  the United Kingdom unlawfully.

         (5)       Little  weight  should  be  given  to  a   private   life
             established  by  a  person  at  a  time  when   the   person's
             immigration status is precarious.

         (6)      In the case of a person who is not liable to  deportation,
             the public interest does  not  require  the  person's  removal
             where-

             (a)    the  person  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting   parental
                  relationship with a qualifying child, and

            (b)   it would not be reasonable to expect the  child  to  leave
                  the United Kingdom."

14. I note that the appellant's sponsor is working and providing  financial
    support for the family.  That, however, is a neutral factor AM (S 117B)
    Malawi [2015] UKUT 0260 (IAC).  The appellant was able  to  produce  an
    entry level certificate in English but  it  was  not  accepted  by  the
    Secretary of State, and she made use of an interpreter  at  court;  her
    English, on the face of it, is limited.  As a policy consideration this
    has been found to be a  very  important  matter  for  integration  into
    British society and I do not dismiss it lightly and it is a factor that
    weighs against the appellant.

15. I take into account Section 117B(5), that little weight should be given
    to a private life that is established by a person at a  time  when  the
    person's immigration status is precarious.  The appellant entered as  a
    work permit dependent and her leave has  always  been  precarious.   In
    relation to her private life the appellant has always  known  that  her
    immigration  status  was  precarious.   Similarly  following  Rajendran
    (S117B- family life)  [2016]  UKUT  138  precariousness  is  a  concept
    relevant to family life as well as private  life.      The  mother  has
    also developed her family life in the full knowledge  that  her  status
    was precarious Deelah and others (section 117B  -  ambit)  [2015]  UKUT
    00515 (IAC).  She made her application for leave to remain in  2014.  I
    do not disregard the family life but place on it limited weight in  the
    circumstances.

16. The mother confirmed that she has a mother and sister in India that she
    previously lived with and with whom no doubt she can stay whilst she is
    making the application and there is clearly  a  legitimate  and  proper
    route for the appellant to follow, but I  cannot  predict  (and  should
    not) the success or otherwise of an entry clearance  application;   the
    appellant produced no evidence as to the possible length of  time  such
    an application would take. The reasons given to me for objecting to the
    temporary separation were the cost, the indeterminate length of time an
    entry clearance application would take, and the pressure on the father.



17. Although her leave  has  been  precarious,  I  nonetheless,  take  into
    account the fact that the mother entered the UK lawfully and has always
    had lawful residence and has now has a British citizen  husband  and  a
    British citizen child. As such this case can be distinguished  from  EV
    Philippines [2014] EWCA Civ 874 where neither parent had  lawful  leave
    to remain.  I turn to Section 117(6) of the Nationality Immigration and
    Asylum Act 2002 which identifies as follows

         117(6)   In the case of a person who is not liable to  deportation,
         the public interest does not require the person's removal where-

         (a) the person has a genuine and subsisting  parental  relationship
         with a qualifying child, and

         (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the  child  to  leave  the
         United Kingdom.

18. I accept that the appellant has a genuine and  subsisting  relationship
    with a qualifying child.  The older child is not the  qualifying  child
    because she has not lived in the UK for seven years or  more;  but  the
    younger child  born  subsequent  to  the  application,  does  fall  for
    consideration under Section 117B(6)(b). Although there is,  however  no
    expectation that this child would have  to  leave  the  United  Kingdom
    because her father is a British citizen and has parental responsibility
    I am not persuaded that he could continue to care for this  very  young
    child whilst the mother returns to make an entry clearance application.
     In effect, the practical reality is that the child would have to leave
    the UK.

19. To my mind the countervailing considerations  of  the  children's  best
    interests raised outweigh, just,  the  legitimate  public  interest  of
    immigration control.    The reality is that a very young child who is a
    British citizen will be removed from the UK, or will be separated  from
    his mother, as will the older child  who  is  settled  at  school.  The
    mother will also  be  separated  from  her  children  and  her  husband
    although the difficulties for  the  adults  are  not  uppermost  in  my
    balancing exercise.  As the Home  Office  Guidance  states  it  is  not
    reasonable to require the removal of a British citizen child  from  the
    UK and insistence that  the  mother  remove,  even  temporarily,  would
    entail the younger child's removal.  As the mother is the primary carer
    of the younger child, the practical reality is that the child  will  be
    required to leave the UK for an unquantifiable period of time.

20. I have as indicated above my findings in relation  to  the  Immigration
    Rules and weighed the various factors against the best interests of the
    children.    I  have  also  taken  into  account  Section  117B.   When
    considering  Section  117B(6)  I  have  had   regard   to   the   wider
    considerations following MA Pakistan v SSHD [2016] EWCA  Civ  705.  The
    ultimate question is set out in Huang v SSHD [2007] UKHL 11

         'In an article 8 case where this question is reached, the  ultimate
         question for the appellate immigration  authority  is  whether  the
         refusal of leave to enter or remain,  in  circumstances  where  the
         life of the family cannot reasonably  be  expected  to  be  enjoyed
         elsewhere, taking full account of all  considerations  weighing  in
         favour of the refusal, prejudices the family life of the  applicant
         in a manner sufficiently serious to  amount  to  a  breach  of  the
         fundamental right protected by article 8. If  the  answer  to  this
         question is affirmative, the refusal is unlawful and the  authority
         must so decide. It is not necessary that the appellate  immigration
         authority, directing itself  along  the  lines  indicated  in  this
         opinion, need ask in addition whether the  case  meets  a  test  of
         exceptionality'.

21. For the reasons given above I am persuaded that  the  expectation  that
    the appellant should  return  to  India  to  make  an  entry  clearance
    application prejudices the family life of the applicant's children in a
    manner sufficiently serious to amount to a disproportionate  breach  of
    the children's fundamental right protected by Article 8  Beoku-Betts  v
    SSHD [2008] UKHL 39.  As set out in R (on the application  of  Chen)  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department (Appendix FM -  Chikwamba  -
    temporary separation - proportionality) (IJR) it  is  easier  in  cases
    relating  to  children  to  show  that  a   temporary   separation   is
    disproportionate.  On the evidence before me I am  therefore  persuaded
    that even temporary separation is  disproportionate  and  I  allow  the
    appellant's appeal.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

application to the Secretary of State and  the  ultimate  appeal  I  am  not
persuaded that a fee award should be made.
