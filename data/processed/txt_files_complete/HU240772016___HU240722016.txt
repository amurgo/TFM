                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellants:    Mr S Winter, Advocate, instructed by Katani & Co,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr A Govan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This decision follows on from:

      i) The ECO's decisions, both dated 10  October  2016,  refusing  entry
         clearance.

     ii) The appellants' grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.

    iii) The decision of FtT Judge P A  Grant-Hutchison,  promulgated  on  7
         February 2018.

     iv) The appellants'  grounds  of  appeal  to  the  UT,  stated  in  the
         application for permission to appeal filed on 23 February 2018.

      v) The grant of permission by FtT Judge Robertson, dated 8 March 2018.

     vi) The UT's directions, issued with the grant of permission.

    vii) The respondent's rule 24 response, dated 20 April 2018.

   viii) The UT's further directions, issued on 2 November 2018.

     ix) The  appellants'  applications  for  permission  to  lodge  further
         documents.

 2. The question identified in the directions issued on 2 November 2018 was
    whether the judge was entitled  to  say  at  [13]  that  there  was  "a
    singular lack of evidence" that the appellants are the children to whom
    the sponsor previously referred.

 3. The judge at [13] went on to say that there was no evidential  link  to
    DNA testing, agreeing with the submission recorded  at  [10  (b)]  that
    there was "no chain of evidence".

 4. The judge granting permission thought that without specification of the
    missing link, arguably that finding was not adequately reasoned.

 5. It so happens that Mr Govan was also the presenting officer in the FtT.
     He clarified that his submission was based on the declaration form for
    DNA testing of the first appellant (page  19  of  the  appellants'  2nd
    inventory of productions in the FtT).  This form  includes  a  list  of
    identification documents which might be produced.  None of the boxes is
    ticked.

 6. That was a point the respondent was  entitled  to  make.   However,  Mr
    Winter pointed to evidence before the FtT, but  not  mentioned  in  the
    decision, by which it might have been found that the appellants are the
    children previously referred to by the sponsor.

 7. I found at the hearing on 15 February 2019 that  the  judge  failed  to
    explain why (more likely than not) the evidence (as a  whole)  did  not
    make out the case.  That was an error of  law  by  which  the  decision
    required to be set side and remade.

 8. Mr Winter asked for a further hearing to  be  fixed,  with  a  view  to
    bringing further evidence.

 9. Mr Govan did not oppose that course.

10. The further hearing was fixed for 25 April 2019.

11. Having considered further evidence produced,  the  respondent  conceded
    that the appeal should be allowed.

12. The decision of the FtT is set aside, and the appeal of both appellants
    is allowed on human rights grounds (article 8).

13. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
