Representation:

For the appellant:     Ms A Watterson, instructed by Mondair Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr C Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Balwinder Kaur, date of birth 24.10.74, is a citizen  of
    India.

 2. This is her appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Cox promulgated on 9.9.14,  dismissing  his  appeal  against  the
    decision of the respondent, dated 4.7.13, to refuse entry clearance  to
    the United Kingdom  as  a  partner  pursuant  to  Appendix  FM  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  The Judge heard the appeal on 20.8.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Pullig  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    14.11.13.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 11.12.14 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Cox should be set aside.

 6. The application was made on the basis of the appellant's marriage to Mr
    Jasvir Singh on 11.3.10. Mr Singh is an Indian national with indefinite
    leave to remain in the UK.

 7. The application was refused by the Entry Clearance Officer  because  it
    was not accepted that the appellant and the sponsor were in  a  genuine
    and subsisting relationship, or that they  intended  to  live  together
    permanently in the UK. Specifically, the Entry  Clearance  Officer  did
    not accept that the marriage was valid, as the name of the  husband  as
    shown on the certificate was incorrect. The certificate was in the name
    Jasbir Singh. However, he renounced this name in  2004,  some  6  years
    before the marriage. His residence permit states his name to be  Jasvir
    Singh Sahota. In interview prior to decision  the  appellant  confirmed
    this as her husband's name and stated that he had never been  known  by
    any other name.

 8. From �17 of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge Cox addressed
    the issue of validity of marriage. Judge Cox found that as a result  of
    the statutory  declaration  of  26.1.04  the  sponsor  "absolutely  and
    entirely renounced relinquished and abandoned the  use  of  his  former
    name of Jasvir Singh.  Thus  Judge  Cox  found  that  the  sponsor  was
    required from that date forward to use the name  Jasvir  Singh  Sahota.
    However, the certificate showed Jasbir  Singh.  Judge  Cox  noted  that
    there was no evidence before her that a marriage can be  valid  if  the
    certificate records the name of the bridgroom  incorrectly.  There  was
    thus insufficient evidence that the marriage was valid.

 9. Judge Cox went on, nevertheless, from �24 to consider the  evidence  of
    the nature of the relationship between the appellant  and  the  sponsor
    and concluded at �42 that there was no satisfactory evidence  that  the
    appellant is in a genuine and subsisting relationship with the sponsor.
    The judge found that the Rules were not met and that the  decision  did
    not infringe article 8 ECHR.

10. In essence the grounds of application for permission to appeal refer to
    �19 of the decision,  where  the  judge  deals  with  the  question  of
    validity of marriage in the light of  the  change  of  the  appellant's
    name. It is submitted that the judge applied too  high  a  standard  of
    proof and ignored the evidence submitted by the  appellant  as  to  the
    validity of the marriage.  A  second  ground  asserts  that  the  judge
    overlooked evidence demonstrating a genuine relationship.

11. In granting permission to appeal,  Judge  Pullig  found  merit  in  the
    grounds as a whole. "I find  that  the  judge's  decision  contains  an
    arguable error of law and I grant permission."

12. For the reasons set out herein, I find that the decision of  Judge  Cox
    did not disclose any material error of law and does not require  to  be
    set aside. In particular, I find  that  the  appellant  has  failed  to
    adequately address the issue of validity of marriage,  raised  both  in
    the refusal decision and in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

13. Ms  Watterson  accepted  that  the  burden  was  on  the  appellant  to
    demonstrate that she  meets  the  requirements  of  the  Rules  and  in
    particular, that marriage was valid, the issue having  been  raised  by
    the Entry Clearance  Officer.  Ms  Watterson  relied  on  the  detailed
    explanation in the sponsor's witness statement of August 2014  and  the
    statement of solicitor Boota Singh Mondair, dated 12.8.14.

14. At �22 of his witness statement, Mr Singh explained that  he  has  been
    unconsciously using different variations of  his  name  and  said  that
    Jasvir and Jabir are often interchanged and that Singh  is  a  standard
    surname given to all Sikh males and  the  actual  surname  (Sahota)  is
    commonly dropped or added. Mr Mondair's statement is to similar effect,
    that the variations in v and b and the use of Singh is commonplace.

15. However, none of this evidence addressed the issue raised by the  Entry
    Clearance Officer and addressed by the First-tier Tribunal  Judge.  The
    judge accepted that the appellant and  the  sponsor  were  the  persons
    married, as their photograph is shown on the certificate. That was  not
    the issue. The issue is whether the  marriage  can  be  valid  when  an
    incorrect name is recorded for one of the parties. On the face  of  the
    record, the  marriage  certificate,  the  name  of  the  bridegroom  is
    incorrect. Judge Cox pointed out that the appellant had  not  addressed
    this by adduce satisfactory evidence that the marriage would  still  be
    regarded as valid notwithstanding the formal  error  of  name.  As  the
    judge  pointed  out  at  �20,  bare  assertions  by   the   appellant's
    representative as to the law in India is insufficient  to  resolve  the
    issue. The judge noted the significant period of time  there  had  been
    since the refusal decision for the appellant  to  address  this  issue.
    There must be an answer in law, but  the  appellant  failed  to  adduce
    evidence to resolve the issue one way or another. It is  all  the  more
    surprising that even now, the appellant had not adduced any  admissible
    evidence to resolve the  issue  in  law  as  to  whether  a  defect  in
    formality such as an incorrect name recorded for one of the parties  to
    a marriage in India has  any  legal  effect  on  the  validity  of  the
    marriage. It did not seem to me that Ms Watterson appreciated the point
    at issue, as most of her submissions were addressed to proving that the
    marriage was genuine and subsisting.

16. Section 85A of the 2002 restricts the Tribunal to considering only  the
    circumstances appertaining at the date of decision. However, I  accept,
    to the limited extent it can assist the appellant,  that  post-decision
    telephone evidence  is  potentially  relevant  to  the  nature  of  the
    relationship between the appellant and the sponsor as at  the  date  of
    decision. To that extent there is a minor error at �37  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal decision and I also accept the argument that on a reading
    of the telephone evidence the apparent contact is  more  frequent  than
    the judge appears to have accepted. However, when read with �38, it  is
    clear that even if the frequency of calls  is  accepted,  it  does  not
    demonstrate that contact was between the  appellant  and  the  sponsor;
    calls can be made for many purposes and to others on that number. Thus,
    taken at its highest, the telephone evidence can carry little weight in
    support of the appellant's case.

17. Considering the evidence as a whole, including that of the interview at
    �27 onwards, I am satisfied that the outcome of the appeal  would  have
    been the same, regardless of the judge's  treatment  of  the  telephone
    evidence. After reviewing the answers given in the marriage  interview,
    the judge reached the conclusion at �34 that the interview demonstrated
    a  rehearsed  account  prepared  for  the  purpose  of  establishing  a
    relationship but was not evidence of the claimed relationship.  At  �35
    the judge also found that the appellant's interview was not  consistent
    with a person  in  a  genuine  and  subsisting  relationship  with  the
    sponsor. It is somewhat surprising that there was no witness  statement
    from the appellant. Cogent reasons have been given  for  reaching  that
    conclusion, on an assessment of the interview record as a whole. In the
    circumstances, I find that the judge's conclusion as to the  nature  of
    the relationship was one to which she was  entitled  to  come  and  for
    which adequate reasoning has been provided. There is no material  error
    of law in this respect.

18. In the light of those findings of fact, it is  inconceivable  that  the
    claim could succeed outside the  Immigration  Rules  on  the  basis  of
    private and/or family life under article 8 ECHR. There was insufficient
    evidence that there  was  a  valid  marriage  and  the  judge  was  not
    satisfied that the appellant  had  discharged  the  burden  on  her  to
    demonstrate that this was a genuine and  subsisting  relationship.  Any
    family life in such circumstances does not  engage  the  protection  of
    article 8 ECHR.

19. It follows that the dismissal of the appeal on  immigration  and  human
    rights grounds was entirely justified.

Conclusion & Decision:

20. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: the appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
