Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms N Nnamani of Counsel instructed by Samuel Louis
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Beg promulgated on 14 February 2018 dismissing  the  appeal  against  a
    decision of the Respondent dated 7 August  2016  refusing  to  grant  a
    permanent residence card under the EEA Regulations.


2.   The Appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born on 2 November 1971.   It  is
    unnecessary for present  purposes  to  rehearse  his  full  immigration
    history: suffice to say that pursuant to an application made in October
    2010 he was granted a residence card  from  7  February  2011  until  7
    February 2016 on the basis of his relationship with his  then  wife  Ms
    Roxanna  Astanilze  Schotsborg  (d.o.b.  1962),  a  national   of   the
    Netherlands.

3.   The Appellant applied for a permanent  residence  card  on  5  February
    2016.  He made his application on the basis  of  a  retained  right  of
    residence following divorce.  He was married to  Ms  Schotsborg  on  19
    April 2008; he has indicated that divorce proceedings were commenced on
    1 October 2015; a decree nisi was pronounced on 15 February 2016, and a
    decree absolute - a copy of which is to be found in  the  documents  on
    file - was pronounced on 30 March 2016.


4.   The Respondent refused  the  application  for  reasons  set  out  in  a
    'reasons for refusal' letter ('RFRL') dated 7 August 2016.


5.   The Appellant appealed to the IAC.


6.   The appeal was dismissed for reasons set out in the Decision of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Beg promulgated on 14 February 2018.


7.   The Appellant applied for permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal
    which was refused in the first instance by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Page, but subsequently granted by Upper Tribunal Judge  Lindsley  on  6
    November 2018.  Judge Lindsley also extended time  in  respect  of  the
    application for permission to appeal.


8.   I am grateful to  the  helpful  manner  in  which  the  representatives
    before me  have  dealt  with  the  issues  in  the  appeal  today.   In
    particular Ms Nnamani guided the Tribunal through the various documents
    in the Appellant's bundle before the First-tier Tribunal  pertinent  to
    the issues underpinning the Appellant's challenge,  and  Mr  Jarvis  in
    turn helpfully and realistically acknowledged the  difficulties  to  be
    found in the First-tier Tribunal's decision in consequence of  scrutiny
    of the documents.


9.   The primary focus  of  the  Respondent's  decision,  and  in  turn  the
    primary focus of proceedings before the First-tier  Tribunal,  was  the
    issue of whether or not Ms Schotsborg was exercising Treaty  rights  at
    the relevant time.  Before the First-tier  Tribunal  the  date  focused
    upon was the date of  the  divorce  -  i.e.  the  date  of  the  decree
    absolute, 30 March 2016.  It is now common ground before me pursuant to
    the decision in Baigazieva [2018] EWCA Civ 1088  that  the  appropriate
    date for  focus  is  in  fact  the  date  of  commencement  of  divorce
    proceedings.


10.  Irrespective of the relevant date, before the First-tier  Tribunal  the
    Appellant relied upon documentary evidence in respect  of  the  claimed
    economic activity of his ex-wife filed in his appeal bundle.  There was
    no direct evidence from Ms  Schotsborg  either  by  way  of  a  witness
    statement or by her attendance at the hearing to  give  oral  evidence.
    The First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  sets  out  her  consideration  of  the
    documents at paragraphs 12 and 13 of the Decision, and concluded  on  a
    balance of probabilities that there was no credible  evidence  that  Ms
    Schotsborg was working - and therefore a 'qualified person' - up to the
    date of divorce on 30 March 2016.


11.  However it is  now  acknowledged  by  Mr  Jarvis  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's analysis appears to overlook,  or  disregard,  a  number  of
    documents that are relevant - and indeed are relevant whether the focus
    is on either the  date  of  divorce  or  the  commencement  of  divorce
    proceedings given that both dates fall within the tax year  from  April
    2015 to April 2016.


12.  The first pertinent document to which Ms Nnamani directed my  attention
    is a calculation result for  2015/2016  (page  60  of  the  Appellant's
    bundle).  It is said that this document emanates from the HMRC, and  it
    can be seen  to  bear  a  unique  reference  number  and  the  national
    insurance number of Ms Schotsborg.  On its face it shows Ms  Schotsborg
    declared income of approximately �12,400 by way of  profit  from  self-
    employment, and indicates her tax  liability  in  consequence  and  her
    national insurance contributions.


13.  The information shown on this first document is  supported  by  a  HMRC
    self-assessment statement dated 1 December 2016 (page 81).  This  shows
    an outstanding tax payment due  to  the  revenue.  Also  shown  is  the
    balancing payment due for the year 2015/2016 - �900.26.  A further copy
    of this document endorsed with a post office receipt  stamp  indicating
    the payment of �900.26 on 1 February 2017 is reproduced at page  83  of
    the bundle.


14.  Necessarily it is said that these documents on their face show that  Ms
    Schotsborg not only submitted a tax calculation, but paid tax owed  for
    the tax year 2015/2016.  There is yet further evidence of these matters
    by way of an HMRC document dated 10 September 2017 showing a charge  of
    �45 for 'late payment' (page 69), together with a post  office  receipt
    for the payment of �45 (page 82).


15.  Because these pertinent documents were not addressed by the  Judge,  Mr
    Jarvis acknowledged that the analysis of the  First-tier  Tribunal  was
    deficient to an extent that amounted to a material error of law.


16.  There was a further issue before the First-tier Tribunal in respect  of
    the Appellant's own circumstances and whether, with  reference  to  the
    Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations, he was a person  who,
    although not an EEA national, would, if he were an EEA national,  be  a
    worker, a self-employed person, or self-sufficient  person  within  the
    meaning of the Regulations.


17.  In this  regard  again  Mr  Jarvis  acknowledged  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal appeared to have erred in stating in  substance  that  it  was
    necessary for the Appellant to demonstrate that he had been working  as
    a self-employed person for a continuous period of five years  -  "I  do
    not find that  there  is  sufficient  evidence...to  confirm  that  the
    appellant has been working as a self-employed person for  a  continuous
    period of five tears" (paragraph 14).  That was  not  the  requirement.
    It was only necessary that the Appellant demonstrate that he  had  been
    so working from the point of the breakdown of the marital relationship.
     Accordingly Mr Jarvis did not seek to suggest that the  error  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal in respect of the ex-wife's economic activity could
    be 'saved' by the Judge's alternative adverse conclusion  expressed  at
    paragraph 14.


18.  In the circumstances it was common ground before me that  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal required  to  be  set  aside.  Moreover,  in
    circumstances  where  the  exploration  of  the  Appellant's   economic
    activity by the First-tier Tribunal appeared so very  limited,  it  was
    also common ground that remaking of the decision in the appeal was most
    appropriately to be undertaken before the First-tier Tribunal with  all
    issues - although in light of the matters set out above it may be  that
    the First-tier Tribunal will require little more by way  of  persuasion
    in respect of Ms Schotsborg's exercise of Treaty rights.  Be that as it
    may, there will require to  be  some  more  careful  consideration  and
    evaluation of the Appellant's circumstances.  It is of course a  matter
    for the Appellant whether or not he wishes to file any further evidence
    in this regard; there is no need  for  particular  directions  in  this
    regard - I anticipate standard directions will be issued in due  course
    by the First-tier Tribunal.


Notice of Decision

19.  The decision is that the First-tier Tribunal's decision  is  set  aside
    for material error of law.


20.  The decision in the appeal  is  to  be  remade  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal by any Judge other than First-tier Tribunal Judge Beg.


21.  No anonymity direction is sought or made.
