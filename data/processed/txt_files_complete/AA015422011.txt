Representation:

For the Appellant: Mr Samra of Harbens Singh & Co
For the Respondent: Mr Smart, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1. The appellant, born on 11 November  1991,  is  a  citizen  of  Iraq.   He
   appeals on asylum, humanitarian protection and human rights and grounds.

Background

2. This appeal has a long history. It comes before me  as  a  remittal  from
   the Court of Appeal following a Consent Order and  Statement  of  Reasons
   made on 20 August 2012.

3. The Statement of Reasons from the Court of Appeal is comprehensive as  to
   the history of the case so it is expedient to set it out in full here:


     1. The appellant is a national of Iraq (born 11.11.92) who arrived  in
        the UK on 19.11.07 illegally  and  claimed  asylum  aged  15.   His
        asylum application was rejected but as  a  minor,  he  was  granted
        discretionary leave to remain until 10.5.09 (when he would be  17�)
        in  accordance  with  the  Secretary  of  State's  policies.    The
        appellant appealed against the refusal of  asylum  but  his  asylum
        appeal was dismissed by the  Asylum  and  Immigration  Tribunal  on
        23.12.08 (p. 49-62).  On 18.12.09 he applied for Further  Leave  to
        Remain as an adult.  This was refused on 27.1.11 (p. 33-42) and the
        appellant appealed.

     2. At the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal (FTT) on 8.3.11,  the
        appellant raised the fact for the first time that  he  had  entered
        into an Islamic marriage with [MB] in support  of  an  Art  8  ECHR
        claim.  MB was born in Bangladesh and still had  family  there  but
        was now  a  British  citizen.   The  FTT  rejected  his  appeal  by
        determination dated 14 March 2011 noting that the relationship  had
        been entered  into  when  the  parties  were  fully  aware  of  his
        precarious status in this country.  The  appellant  would  have  to
        return to Iraq to seek entry clearance as a spouse if he  satisfied
        the requirements of the Immigration Rules, he would be  successful.
        Removal was proportionate (para 33, p. 31).

     3. The appellant made an application for  reconsideration,  which  was
        ordered on Article 8 ECHR grounds.  Reconsideration  was  heard  by
        Deputy Upper Tribunal  Judge  (DUTJ)  Parkes  who  noted  that  the
        appellant did not satisfy the Immigration  Rules  for  leave  as  a
        spouse or fianc� because of  the  requirement  that  he  should  be
        maintained and accommodated without recourse to public funds  (para
        21).  He went on to express doubt  over  whether  the  relationship
        between the appellant and MB was "as strong as had been  suggested"
        and whether it could "necessarily be  regarded  as  being  durable"
        (para 25).

     4. DUTJ Parkes noted that the evidence showed that the appellant could
        live in Iraq safely.  He observed: "It has been found that it would
        not be reasonable to expect her [MB] to live in Iraq and I  do  not
        disturb that finding" (para 29).  However,  he  concluded  that  it
        would be "reasonable and proportionate" to expect the appellant  to
        return to Iraq to seek re-entry to the UK as a  spouse/fianc�  with
        the support of his partner (para 31).

     5. The DUTJ went on to consider the  alternative  possibility  of  the
        couple living in Bangladesh, noting that the appellant  could  live
        there, where he would have to work.  He noted  that  MB  had  spent
        much of her life in Bangladesh, had a  mother  there  who  owned  a
        house (para 27) and that it was not suggested that the couple could
        not live there.  At paragraph 23, DUTJ Parkes found that:  "23  ...
        It is clear that she [MB] can live in Bangladesh and the  appellant
        appears to be able to do so too.  There is no evidence to show that
        it is not possible or for that matter unreasonable."  He went on at
        paragraph 30 to find that the appellant's partner could  return  to
        Bangladesh with the appellant and at paragraph 32 that  she  had  a
        choice of where she lived and conducted their relationship.

     6. Permission to appeal was granted by the Court  of  Appeal  (Lewison
        LJ) on two grounds:

        i)  whether  the  Upper  Tribunal  was  wrong   to   consider   the
           proportionality of the  Appellant's  removal  to  Iraq,  on  the
           assumption that the Appellant could relocate  with  his  British
           citizen partner to her place of birth, Bangladesh.

       ii) whether the Upper Tribunal erred  in  relying  implicitly  on  a
           Country  Guidance  Iraq  case  to  assess  the  safety  of   the
           Appellant's return to Iraq when that Country Guidance  case  has
           subsequently been set aside on appeal.

     7. The Respondent considers that in the  particular  circumstances  of
        this case, there is merit in the appellant's  first  appeal  ground
        that in the  light  of  MB's  status  as  a  British  citizen,  the
        proportionality of the appellant's removal  should  not  take  into
        account the possibility that  his  partner  MB  could  relocate  to
        Bangladesh with him.  This is in  the  light  of  recent  case  law
        stressing the importance of citizenship, particularly ZH (Tanzania)
        v Secretary of State [2011] UKSC 4 paras 20,  30-32,  47)  and  the
        Upper Tribunal case  of  Sanade  and  others  (British  children  -
        Zambrano - Dereci) India  [2012]  UKUT  00048  (IAC)  in  which  Mr
        Justice Blake stated (at para 95):

           "95.  This means that where the child or  indeed  the  remaining
           spouse is a British citizen  and  therefore  a  citizen  of  the
           European Union, it is not possible to require them  to  relocate
           outside of the European Union or to  submit  that  it  would  be
           reasonable for them to do so.  The case serves to emphasise  the
           importance of nationality already identified in the decision  of
           the Supreme Court in ZH (Tanzania).  If  interference  with  the
           family life is to be justified, it can only be on the basis that
           the  conduct  of  the  person  to  be  removed  gives  rise   to
           considerations of such weight as to justify separation."

     8. As the appellant's partner is a British citizen,  the  parties  are
        agreed  that  it  was   not   appropriate,   when   assessing   the
        proportionality of the appellant's removal, to contend that it  was
        reasonable for the family to maintain  family  life  by  relocating
        outside the European Union when  that  family  included  a  British
        citizen.  In the circumstances, the parties  are  agreed  that  the
        matter should be remitted to the Tribunal in  order  to  reconsider
        proportionality under Article 8 ECHR disregarding  the  possibility
        of  the  appellant  and  his  British  citizen  partner  relocating
        themselves in Bangladesh.

     9. The parties also agree that the matter should be  remitted  to  the
        Upper Tribunal in order that the "risk on return" assessment of the
        appellant's asylum  and  Humanitarian  Protection  appeals  may  be
        reconsidered in light  of  the  current  case  law  and  background
        material."


4. Various events then intervened which prevented the matter  being  finally
   determined until it came before me over a year after  the  Consent  Order
   and Statement of Reasons agreed before the Court of Appeal.

5. Firstly, the appellant's previous solicitors were intervened on  the  day
   of the first listed hearing.

6. Secondly, the matter proceeded for some time on the  incorrect  basis  of
   trying to establish whether the appellant could return to Bangladesh with
   his partner or whether the partner could be expected to  return  to  Iraq
   with the appellant.

7. At a For Mention hearing on 1 August 2013 I put it to  the  parties  that
   [8] and [9] of the Statement of Reasons were clear and that  it  was  not
   open to the respondent to argue  that  the  partner  should  relocate  to
   either Bangladesh or Iraq in order to exercise her family life  with  the
   appellant. She had conceded before the Court of Appeal  at  [8]  that  MB
   could not be expected to leave the European Union in  order  to  continue
   her family life with the appellant. At a further  hearing  on  15  August
   2013 Mr Smart confirmed that the respondent accepted that MB could not be
   expected to go to either Iraq or Bangladesh  in  order  to  continue  her
   family life with the appellant.

8. The matter was therefore listed for full hearing before me on  3  October
   2013 in order to decide:

      a. the appellant's asylum, Article 3 ECHR and humanitarian  protection
      claims against current case law and background material


      b. whether the decision requiring the  appellant  to  return  to  Iraq
      breached the rights of the appellant and his partner under  Article  8
      of the ECHR, it being accepted that the partner could not be  expected
      to relocate with the appellant to either Bangladesh or Iraq.

Asylum, Humanitarian Protection and Article 3 of the ECHR

9. The parties agreed that the facts concerning the appellant's  history  in
   Iraq are  no  longer  in  dispute.   They  are  the  facts  as  found  by
   Immigration Judge Dubicka and Senior Immigration Judge  Renton  in  their
   determination dated 14 December 2008.  They are as follows.

10. The appellant was born on 11 November 1991.  He is Iraqi and comes  from
   the town of Rahimawa in the area of Kirkuk. The  appellant's  mother  was
   killed in a suicide bomb explosion  in  2005  whilst  shopping  in  town.
   Three letters were sent to his home in 2005.  The sender  and  nature  of
   the contents are unknown to the appellant.  The  appellant's  father  was
   killed in a suicide bomb explosion in 2006.  After his father was  killed
   he went to live with his maternal uncle near Kirkuk.  He was sent out  of
   Iraq by his uncle because of  his  trauma  following  the  death  of  his
   parents and the very high level of violence across Iraq at that time.

11. Mr Samra conceded for the appellant that he could  not  show  a  Refugee
   Convention reason for any harm that might arise on  return  to  Iraq.   I
   therefore dismissed the appellant's asylum claim.

12. Mr Samra did not challenge the finding of the Upper Tribunal in the  new
   country guidance case of HM and others (Article 15(c)) Iraq  [2012]  UKUT
   00409 (IAC) that the degree of indiscriminate violence characterising the
   current armed conflict taking place in the five central  governorates  in
   Iraq including Kirkuk is not  at  such  a  high  level  that  substantial
   grounds are shown for believing that any civilian  returned  there  would
   solely on account of his presence there face a real risk of being subject
   to threat.

13. Mr Samra conceded, given the agreed history, that nothing  distinguished
   this appellant in such a way as to raise the level of individual risk  to
   him were he to return to Iraq beyond that set out in HM and others.

14. I found that  the  appellant  could  not  show  that  he  qualified  for
   Humanitarian Protection under Article 15(c) of the Refugee  Qualification
   Directive 2004/83/EC or that he qualified for protection under Article  3
   of the ECHR.  I dismissed the appeal on those grounds also.

Article 8 of the ECHR

15. Article 8 of the ECHR states that:
      " 1.  Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family
          life, his home and his correspondence.
       2.   There shall be no interference by a public authority with the
          exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the
          law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of
          national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the
          country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the
          protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the
          rights and freedoms of others."
16. The parties were in agreement that the first four Razgar questions  were
   answered in the appellant's favour and  that  the  issue  before  me  was
   proportionality.

17. It was contended for the respondent, however, that the  family  life  of
   the appellant and his partner was not as strong as they  claimed.  It  is
   therefore expedient to indicate at the outset of the Article 8 assessment
   the facts as I find them to be concerning the family and private life  of
   the appellant and MB.

18. The basic facts are not in dispute. The couple met at college  in  2009.
   They formed a relationship and started  living  together  at  some  point
   after that. They underwent an Islamic marriage on 14 October 2010.   They
   applied for a certificate of approval to  undergo  a  civil  marriage  in
   February 2011. They were informed in June 2011 that they did not  need  a
   certificate to  marry.  They  did  not  marry  but  have  remained  in  a
   relationship.

19.  Mr  Smart  maintained  that  the  evidence,  from  the   appellant   in
   particular, was  inconsistent as to  when  the  couple  started  to  live
   together. Further, the couple  had  not  married  even  though  they  had
   appeared to want to do so in 2011 and could have done so at any time from
   June 2011 onwards. Both of these matters, he  submitted,  indicated  that
   that the relationship is not as serious as the couple claim it to be.

20. Mr Smart also submitted that the appellant had not shown himself  to  be
   a credible witness in previous proceedings and that this  also  indicated
   that his family life was not as he  claimed.  He  was  not  found  wholly
   credible by Judges Dubicka and Renton  in  his  asylum  appeal  in  2008.
   Further, in his evidence to Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Parkes  in  2011,
   he stated that he had left his Iraqi passport at home that day.   At  the
   hearing before me the appellant denied ever owning an Iraqi passport.

21. I will deal with those  submissions  in  reverse  order.  The  appellant
   stated in his  screening  interview  that  he  has  never  had  an  Iraqi
   passport. The only source of contradictory evidence is in the  record  of
   his evidence before Judge Parkes. When cross-examined on the point before
   me his evidence was quite clear; he has never had an Iraqi  passport.  He
   had an ID card and had given it to his solicitors and thought it had been
   sent to the respondent.

22. MB was asked if the appellant had an Iraqi passport. Her  response  made
   it clear that there was confusion about what document she was being asked
   to comment on.  She initially thought  she  was  being  asked  about  the
   appellant's identity document issued by the respondent.  When  the  point
   was clarified, she stated that she had never seen an Iraqi  passport  for
   the appellant.

23. These parts of the evidence suggested to me that the same confusion  had
   occurred before of Judge Parkes. I did not find that  the  appellant  had
   given  unreliable  evidence  about  having  been  issued  with  an  Iraqi
   passport.

24. Secondly, the appellant was found mainly credible in his  asylum  claim.
   It was  only his evidence about the contents of  the  letters  that  were
   sent to his home in 2005 that was found not  reliable.  It  was  accepted
   that the letters were sent, however. I did not consider that the  limited
   adverse credibility  finding  in  the  asylum  claim  was  sufficient  to
   undermine to any significant extent the substantial  evidence  before  me
   regarding the appellant's family and private life.

25. Thirdly, the appellant and MB gave entirely consistent  evidence  as  to
   why they have not had a civil marriage. They want to wait until they  can
   afford a ceremony including a proper wedding dress for MB,  a  video  and
   photographs for the future and so on. That is a very ordinary desire  for
   many couples.  It is the tradition in the backgrounds of both appellants.



26. Further, I also had before me a report dated 25 April 2013  of  Mr  Mark
   Burtenshaw of Worcestershire County Council  Social  Services  Department
   who is the personal adviser to the appellant.  He has known the appellant
   since he came to the UK. Mr Burtenshaw attended many of the  hearings  in
   this matter, including the For Mention hearings on 1 August and 15 August
   2013 before me, but was unable to attend the substantive  hearing  as  he
   was on leave. It was not suggested to me that his report  was  unreliable
   as a result. I bore in mind that it was not tested, however, but given Mr
   Burtenshaw's professional standing and the consistency of  what  he  said
   with the other evidence, I found I  was  able  to  place  weight  on  his
   report.

27. Amongst other matters, it was his view that the appellant  and  MB  were
   in a serious relationship and were "very traditional and conservative  in
   terms of what they want from their relationship in the future"  and  that
   "they would like to find employment, start saving towards a recognised UK
   wedding".    His evidence was  therefore  consistent  with  that  of  the
   appellant and MB.

28. It was my conclusion that the fact that the appellant and  MB  have  not
   yet had a civil marriage was not something  which  suggested  that  their
   relationship is not serious.

29. Fourthly, there is no doubt  that  the  appellant  has  given  different
   dates across his various accounts as to when he  and  MB  started  living
   together. In his evidence before me he stated that at present  they  live
   in a flat together and also lived in a flat together prior to this,  that
   period of cohabitation in these two flats amounting to approximately  two
   years.  Prior to that they had separate accommodation, his given  to  him
   by NASS, MB's given to her by Social Services.  Her accommodation was  in
   a hostel where there was a requirement that she stay there for  at  least
   five nights a week.  She had therefore stayed there during the  week  and
   spent the weekends with the appellant.  He came to see her at the  hostel
   during the week.

30. MB gave identical evidence on this issue.

31. In their evidence the appellant and MB referred to the  period  of  time
   when they had separate accommodation but were spending weekends  together
   and seeing each other during the week as "living together".   My  reading
   of their evidence was that they  meant  by  this  that  they  were  in  a
   committed relationship and spending as much time together as their living
   arrangements at the time allowed. I found that to  be  a  straightforward
   explanation for much of the variation in the dates given by the appellant
   for when they began living together. It was not at all my impression that
   the different dates given for  when  they  started  living  together  was
   intended to mislead or exaggerate the strength of their relationship.

32. I also had corroborative evidence from Mr  Burtenshaw  on  this  matter.
   The information he provided in his report was that he  met  MB  in  2010,
   that the couple have been together ever since  and  that  MB  has  almost
   always been with the appellant when he has visited him. Since 2011 he had
   been visiting them in joint accommodation. He stated that:

            "It is my opinion that S and  MB  have  a  healthy,  happy  and
           loving relationship based on mutual trust and love -  I  do  not
           have  any  concerns  regarding  its  legitimacy  based   on   my
           experiences with the couple".

33. It was my conclusion that the evidence showed that appellant and MB  are
   in a committed relationship. They have been in that relationship for four
   years, have been married according to their religion for three years  and
   cohabited for at least two years.

34. It was additionally my view that the backgrounds of  the  appellant  and
   MB have led to them being a particularly  close  and  mutually  dependent
   couple.

35. It is accepted that the appellant  lost  both  his  parents  in  violent
   circumstances at a young age and suffered trauma as a result.

36. Ms Begum's consistent and unchallenged evidence was she was  brought  to
   the UK when very young by her  father.  When  her  father  died  she  was
   approximately aged 7.  Thereafter she lived with distant relatives.   She
   was brought up in  a  very  traditional  manner  in  keeping  with  their
   Bangladeshi heritage.  When she became a teenager she was very restricted
   and became depressed, beginning to self-harm at approximately the age  of
   15.  I was shown a photograph of extensive cutting scars on  both  of  Ms
   Begum's forearms and there was no dispute from the Home Office that those
   injuries arose from self-harm as  an  expression  of  her  mental  health
   problems.

37. Ms Begum also explained how, as she approached adulthood, she  was  told
   by her distant relatives that she had to marry somebody from  Bangladesh.
   By then she knew her own mind and knew that this was not what she wanted.
    She objected. She had limited freedom but,  when  she  could,  began  to
   leave the home for extended periods, not letting her relatives know where
   she was. On occasions they called  the  police  and  eventually,  on  the
   intervention of the police and Children's Social Services, she  was  able
   to leave home and was  placed  in  a  hostel.   This  was  when  she  was
   approximately 17 years old.

38. MB stated that she continued to self-harm and has taken overdoses.   She
   explained that, as a result, she is only given a prescription of her anti-
   depressant medication one month at a time by her GP rather than  a  three
   month prescription. She continues to see the Community Mental Health Team
   (CMHT) but less so than before as a result of feeling stronger because of
   her relationship with the appellant.

39. The appellant confirmed MB's evidence, stating that  he  has  talked  to
   the professionals involved in her care who encourage him to  continue  to
   support her, calming her down when she is distressed, helping her to rest
   and so on. It was his view that she had improved, not having  self-harmed
   for five months prior to the hearing.

40. I had a letter dated 23  August  2013  before  me  from  MB's  Community
   Psychiatric Nurse, Ms Cecilia White. Her letter is brief so I can set  it
   out in full:

        "This is to inform you that Mrs Begum is  known  to  mental  health
        services since  2012.   She  has  a  diagnosis  of  depression  and
        anxiety.

        She has been  treated  and  there  has  been  progress.   Her  life
        circumstances play a big role in her condition.  She will need time
        and special concessions to improve her  language  skills  and  have
        access to training and education to then access the job market with
        some advantage.  Without this option, MB will remain vulnerable  to
        predators, poverty and depravation and will continue to  depend  on
        mental health services and social security.

        MB is enthusiastic about  improving  herself.   She  just  needs  a
        little bit of help at this time.

        I will be most grateful for your sympathetic attention and guidance
        to MB."

41. As with the evidence of Mr Burtenshaw, that of Ms White was  not  tested
   before me and I bore that  in  mind  when  weighing  her  letter.  Again,
   though, it is entirely consistent with that of the appellant and  MB.  It
   is also consistent with that of Mr Burtenshaw. His opinion was that:

        "MB would really struggle if [the appellant] was  forced  to  leave
        the UK and she would be again left alone in  the  UK,  particularly
        vulnerable  in  how  she  is  viewed  within  the  community  after
        cohabiting and being married (Islamic) to [the appellant].  I think
        she will feel very isolated and would be liable to being ostracised
        or possibly exploited."

42.  In summary,  the  appellant  and  MB  both  have  traumatic  histories,
   similar in the significant matter of losing their parents at a young age,
   and it did not surprise me at all that, given their histories, they  have
   formed a relationship of more than usual   strength  and  dependency  for
   young people of their age.

Proportionality

43. The respondent accepts that it is not reasonable to expect Ms  Begum  to
   live on a permanent basis in Iraq. That must be right, not  only  because
   she is British and therefore an EEA citizen,  but  because  of  her  long
   residence here and particular vulnerability as set out above.

44. However, it was argued for the respondent it was  reasonable  to  expect
   the appellant to return to Iraq to seek  entry  clearance.  The  evidence
   provided concerning waiting times for such entry  clearance  applications
   indicated that the separation would be between three to six months at the
   most.  It was also suggested  that,  in  the  alternative,  MB  could  be
   expected to visit  the  appellant  in  Iraq  whilst  he  made  his  entry
   clearance application.

45. In general terms, the respondent's argument is not objectionable but  it
   did not appear to me that  it  was  sustainable  in  light  of  the  very
   particular facts of this case.

46. The panel who decided the appellant's asylum claim  found  that  he  was
   traumatised by the  violent  deaths  of  his  parents  and  disturbed  at
   thoughts of return to Iraq. The professional  view  of  MB  is  that  she
   remains a vulnerable young person who needs support. She  self-harmed  as
   recently as five months prior to the hearing. She continues to  be  under
   the care of a CMHT. It was not suggested that she  could  access  similar
   support in Iraq if she accompanied the appellant whilst he  sought  entry
   clearance.

47. The appellant and  M  are  still  very  young  and  not  experienced  in
   independent living, even in the UK.

48. Iraq is not in a state  of  indiscriminate  violence  to  a  level  that
   allows for  humanitarian  protection  or  Article  3  claims  but  it  is
   difficult to see it as a beneficial environment for MB even for  a  short
   period given her difficulties.  The appellant will be returned to Baghdad
   and his home area is Kirkuk. The respondent's  "Iraq  Bulletin:  Security
   Situation Update" dated 13 August 2013 states at 4.04 that:

        "However, insecurity in Iraq has prevailed in recent years. The IBC
        paper, 'The War in Iraq: 10 years and  counting',  dated  19  March
        2013 characterised the conflict in  Iraq  as  '...  entrenched  and
        pervasive, with a clear beginning but no foreseeable end, and  very
        much a part of the present in Iraq.' Whilst according to the  UNCHR
        Eligibility Guidelines 2012, 'bombings, shootings and assassination
        by armed groups continued  on  a  daily  basis  to  impact  on  the
        civilian population, with violence  occurring  'mostly  in  central
        Iraq'. Baghdad, Ninewa and in particular Mosul, were identified  as
        the most violent  places,  followed  by  Kirkuk,  Al-Anbar,  Babel,
        Diyala and Salah Al-Din (my emphasis)'

49. Put simply, it did not appear to me proportionate for MB to go  to  Iraq
   with the appellant even for a limited period.

50. I did not accept that the estimate of a three to six  month  period  for
   the entry clearance application to be decided could not be taken  at  its
   highest, in any event. Mr Samra pointed  out  that  decisions  on  spouse
   entry clearance applications have been suspended following  the  decision
   of Blake LJ in MM which is currently under appeal in the Court of Appeal.



51. The lack of certainty as to how long  the  entry  clearance  application
   would take, whether M was waiting in the UK or went to Iraq, appeared  to
   me to be significant  in  this  case  as  a  result  of  MB's  particular
   vulnerability and the other factors I have set  out  above.  Even  if  MB
   remains in the UK whilst the entry  clearance  application  is  made,  Mr
   Burtenshaw referred to her struggling in the absence of the appellant and
   becoming "particularly vulnerable".

52. There is the additional matter that the appellant has  been  in  the  UK
   with lawful leave since November 2007, very nearly 6 years, and that  the
   relationship with MB was formed whilst he had  leave.  Theirs  is  not  a
   relationship formed in the "precarious" circumstances  often  seen  where
   one party is an illegal entrant or overstayer who has never been  in  the
   UK lawfully.

53. I should indicate that it did not appear  to  me  that  the  appellant's
   private life was sufficient to amount to  a  significant  factor  in  the
   proportionality  assessment.  He  has  not  been  here  long  enough   or
   established a private life of sufficient significance for that to be so.

54. In making the assessment set out above, I have borne in  mind  all  that
   weighs in favour of the respondent's  decision  being  proportionate.  In
   particular,  the  appellant  cannot  meet  the   Immigration   Rules   on
   maintenance grounds. He  has never worked or maintained  himself,  having
   been reliant on public funds since his  arrival.  This  is  a  factor  of
   direct relevance and significance  to  the  economic  well-being  of  the
   country and I have given it significant weight. His  discretionary  leave
   did not give him any expectation of being able to settle here.

55. It remained the case, because of the very  particular  circumstances  of
   this couple set out above, that I did  not  find  that  the  interference
   would arise from the appellant's return to Iraq, even  if  just  to  seek
   entry clearance, was proportionate to the legitimate  end  sought  to  be
   achieved.

56. I would merely add that it was not argued that I should  apply  the  new
   Immigration Rules to this appeal. Given my findings, however, it appeared
   to me that the appellant met them. Paragraph EX.1 provides that if:

      (b)   the applicant has a genuine and subsisting relationship  with  a
      partner who is in the UK and is a British citizen, settled in  the  UK
      or in the UK with refugee leave or humanitarian protection, and  there
      are  insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life  with  that   partner
      continuing outside the UK...

the application should succeed under the  Immigration  Rules  on  Article  8
grounds.

57.  The  respondent's  position  in  this  matter   is   that   there   are
   insurmountable obstacles to MB returning to Iraq with the appellant. That
   is why I was not required to assess whether expecting her to  do  so  was
   reasonable or proportionate.

58. I should also add that the case was heard before  the  guidance  of  the
   Court of Appeal in MF v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 1192 was handed down  but  I
   do not read  that  case  as  making  any  substantive  difference  to  my
   assessment.

59. In summary, it is my conclusion that the respondent's  decision,  albeit
   promoting an effective immigration system and thereby the  economic  good
   of the UK, and notwithstanding the significant weight that must be  given
   to that in the assessment, amounted to  a  disproportionate  interference
   with the family and private life of the appellant and  MB  and  that  the
   appeal must therefore be allowed under Article 8 of the ECHR.
Decision

60. The appeal  on  asylum,  Humanitarian  protection  and  Article  3  ECHR
   grounds is dismissed.

61. The appeal under Article 8 of the ECHR is allowed.
