                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is an appeal by the Appellant against the decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Devittie (Judge Devittie),  promulgated  on  3  November
    2014, in which he dismissed the Appellant's  appeal.  That  appeal  was
    against the Respondent's decision, dated 21 February 2014, to refuse to
    vary her leave to remain and to remove  her  from  the  United  Kingdom
    under section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

 2. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Levin  on
    6 January 2015.

Anonymity

 3. No direction has been made previously, and we see  no  reason  for  one
    now.

Background

 4.  Appellant is a national of Jamaica, born on 12 December 1991. She came
    to the United Kingdom on 6 August 2000 as a visitor and has  been  here
    ever since. On 5 February 2010 she was granted Discretionary  Leave  to
    Remain as a dependent on her mother, Ms Charmaine  Scott.  In  February
    2013, prior to the expiry of that leave, the Appellant applied  for  an
    extension. This  application  was  based  on  Article  8  grounds.  The
    Respondent refused the application  on  the  basis  that  in  2012  the
    Appellant had been convicted  of  travelling  on  the  railway  without
    paying a fare and in 2014 she was  convicted  of  criminal  damage.  In
    addition, she had failed to disclose the 2012 conviction  in  her  2013
    application form. Therefore, when considering Paragraph 276ADE  of  the
    Immigration Rules, the Appellant  failed  to  satisfy  the  suitability
    requirements and so did not meet sub-paragraph (i) of Paragraph 276ADE.
    Other  than  this,  the  Appellant  would  have   satisfied   Paragraph
    276ADE(v).

 5. The Appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.

The hearing before Judge Devittie

 6. The judge found that the Appellant had in fact arrived  in  the  United
    Kingdom in 2000 at the age  of  eight.  He  found  that  she  was  well
    integrated into life here. He also found that she has family members in
    Jamaica (see paragraph 16). In paragraph 17 the  judge  concluded  that
    the Appellant's criminality itself did not justify  a  conclusion  that
    her presence in the United Kingdom was  not  conducive  to  the  public
    good.

 7. In paragraph 10 Judge Devittie did not believe that the  Appellant  had
    not known about her 2012 conviction  when  completing  the  application
    form in 2013. As a result, he concluded that the  Appellant  could  not
    succeed  under  Paragraph  276ADE(v)   because   of   the   suitability
    requirement in Paragraph 276ADE(i). Relying on his finding in paragraph
    10, the judge went on in paragraph 18 to conclude that the  Appellant's
    deception in concealing the conviction weighed so heavily  against  her
    that it tipped the scales in the  Respondent's  favour  when  assessing
    proportionality outside of the Immigration Rules.

The grounds of appeal

 8. In essence, the grounds argue that the judge placed excessive weight on
    the 2012 conviction issue and failed to take proper account of the fact
    that in all other respects the Appellant satisfied Paragraph 276ADE.



Procedural history of the appeal in the Upper Tribunal

 9. The appeal was initially listed  before  Deputy  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Zucker on 17 April 2015. He heard some evidence and submissions on  the
    error  of  law  issue  but  then  adjourned  the  matter  for   further
    information to be obtained. On 12 June  2015  he  again  adjourned  the
    case, it seems for the same reason as  previously.  On  17  July  Judge
    Zucker was unable to hear the appeal due to  unforeseen  circumstances.
    We obtained a transfer order from the Resident Upper Tribunal Judge (on
    file), and could therefore proceed to hear the  case  ourselves.  There
    was no objection to this from Ms Fijiwala.

The hearing before us

10. The Appellant was unrepresented at the hearing before us. The nature of
    the proceedings and the issues were all explained to the Appellant  and
    her mother at the outset.

11. Ms Fijiwala provided the Appellant and us with a  print  out  from  the
    Police  National  Computer  (on  file).  The  Appellant  was  given  an
    opportunity to look through  this,  but  she  was  content  to  proceed
    without a break.

12. There was no dispute that the 2014 conviction for criminal  damage  had
    been overturned on 30 October 2014 (evidence of this is on file).

13. Ms Fijiwala accepted that there was a material  error  of  law  in  the
    judge's decision. This was because  he  had  failed  to  have  adequate
    regard to the Appellant's explanation as to the non-disclosure  of  the
    2012  conviction.  Paragraph  4  of  the  decision  stated   that   the
    explanation emanated from a witness statement when in fact it had  been
    included in grounds  of  appeal.  Paragraph  4  also  stated  that  the
    explanation was that the Appellant was unaware of the  2012  conviction
    until the Respondent's decision on her 2013 application  was  received.
    This too was wrong. In fact the Appellant  had  stated  that  she  only
    became aware of it during proceedings for criminal  damage  in  January
    2014.

Decision on error of law

14. It is clear to us that Judge Devittie erred in his consideration of the
    Appellant's evidence. Ms Fijiwala has quite rightly recognised this. In
    making findings on the core issue of the  non-disclosure  of  the  2012
    conviction, the judge firstly stated that there had been no explanation
    offered by the Appellant at all  (paragraph  10).  This  is  of  course
    wrong; she had done so in the  grounds  of  appeal  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal. Second, and in apparent contradiction to what he  later  said
    in paragraph 10, at paragraph 4 the  judge  stated  tat  there  was  an
    explanation, but wrongly attributed this to a witness statement when in
    fact it came  from  the  grounds.  Third,  the  judge  then  failed  to
    accurately state what the explanation was. On such a core matter (being
    in fact the sole issue on which the appeal turned), these  inaccuracies
    amount to an error of law, and this error is obviously material to  the
    outcome of the appeal.

15. We therefore set aside Judge Devittie's decision.

Re-make decision

16. It was appropriate for us  to  go  and  re-make  the  decision  without
    adjourning the appeal  yet  again.  Neither  party  sought  to  suggest
    otherwise.

The evidence

17. We have an appeal bundle  from  the  Respondent,  including:  the  2013
    application  form;  statements  from  the  Appellant  and  her  mother;
    passport extracts; and the reasons for refusal letter.  The  notice  of
    appeal is on file. We have the PNC print  out  provided  to  us  My  Ms
    Fijiwala. We have also taken account of the note of  hearing  taken  by
    Judge Zucker on 17 April 2015.

18. We heard oral evidence from the Appellant. She  told  us,  as  she  had
    Judge Zucker on 17 April, that she was unaware of the  2012  conviction
    when  the  2013  application   form   was   completed   by   her   then
    representatives. They had read out questions from the form to  her  and
    she had given truthful  answers.  She  was  first  aware  of  the  2012
    conviction during the prosecution for criminal damage in January  2014.
    She had not paid  a  fine  of  �140.  The  2012  conviction  was  being
    challenged. The  Appellant  had  been  living  at  her  mother's  house
    throughout the relevant period.

19. The Appellant's mother also told us that no fine had been paid.

20. There were no questions from Ms Fijiwala.

Submissions

21. Ms Fijiwala relied on the original  reasons  for  refusal  letter.  She
    submitted that because the PNC print out  did  not  show  a  subsequent
    conviction for a failure to pay the �140 fine for the fare evasion, the
    Appellant must have paid that fine. It followed,  she  submitted,  that
    the Appellant was aware of the conviction  at  the  time  of  the  2013
    application.  There  was  no  evidence  of  a  challenge  to  the  2012
    conviction. Judge Devittie had found that the  Appellant  had  ties  in
    Jamaica, and these findings were relied on. We  should  take  the  2012
    conviction into account as well as the  failure  to  disclose  it.  The
    decisions in SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA  Civ  387  and  AM  (s117B)  Malawi
    [2015] UKUT 0260 (IAC) were relied on. The pending prosecutions  stated
    in the PNC document were relevant.

22. The Appellant's mother responded on her  daughter's  behalf  by  saying
    that there were no ties with the father, that the  Appellant  had  been
    abused in Jamaica, and that there are emotional ties here.

Burden and standard of proof

23. The burden of proving facts relied on in  respect  of  the  suitability
    requirements  under  Section  S-LTR  of  Appendix  FM  rests  with  the
    Respondent. In respect of all other matters the burden  lies  with  the
    Appellant. The standard of proof in all matters is that of a balance of
    probabilities.

Findings of fact

24. There has never been a dispute about when the Appellant arrived in  the
    United Kingdom and we find that she in fact came here on 6 August 2000.
    In absence of any evidence or suggestion to the contrary, we also  find
    that she has remained here ever since.

25. We find that the Appellant was in fact unaware of the  2012  conviction
    when the 2013 application form  was  completed.  First,  we  found  the
    Appellant to be a credible witness. Her explanation of  being  ignorant
    of the conviction has been consistently provided in  written  and  oral
    evidence, beginning with  the  grounds  of  appeal  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, through the witness statements, and in oral evidence to Judge
    Zucker and then before us. The Appellant was not cross-examined  by  Ms
    Fijiwala.

26. Second, it is not inherently improbable that the  Appellant  would  not
    have known about the conviction. Administrative inefficiencies  or  the
    non-receipt or delivery of post are possible explanations.  Whist  this
    is speculation, the fact of ignorance of the conviction is not:  it  is
    direct evidence from the Appellant.

27. Third, the absence of any subsequent conviction for non-payment of  the
    �140 fine (which we accept  was  imposed)  does  not  lead  by  way  of
    sufficiently strong inference to the conclusion that the fine must have
    been  paid  and  therefore  the  Appellant  was  always  aware  of  the
    conviction itself. There is no positive evidence  from  the  Respondent
    that a fine was in fact paid. It is well-known that payment of fines is
    not always followed up by the relevant agencies in a timely manner,  or
    at all. We also take account of, and accept,  the  oral  evidence  from
    both the Appellant and her mother that no fine was ever paid. This oral
    evidence was not the subject of cross-examination.

28. In light of the above, we find that the Respondent has failed to  prove
    the facts necessary  to  show  that  deception  was  practised  by  the
    Appellant in respect of  the  2013  application  form.  We  would  have
    reached  the  same  conclusion  if  the  burden  had  rested  with  the
    Appellant.

29. We find that the conviction of fare evasion on 20  February  2012  does
    not  constitute  any  form  of  serious  offending  behaviour  by   the
    Appellant. Indeed, it was very much at the lower end of  the  offending
    spectrum. We also accept that the Appellant's expression of remorse for
    the fare evasion is  genuine.  In  light  of  the  overturning  of  the
    conviction for criminal damage, there are no other convictions  against
    the Appellant. We find that there is no material risk  of  re-offending
    or a risk to the public at large. We place no material  weight  on  the
    evidence of pending prosecutions contained in the PNC print out,  there
    being no additional evidence from the Respondent whatsoever to indicate
    the nature or background of the alleged offences.

30. On the evidence before us we find that the  Appellant  has  significant
    ties in the United Kingdom, not least of which involve her  mother.  We
    accept that a close bond exists between them.  Further,  the  Appellant
    has studied here and acquired skills which will assist her  in  finding
    employment.

Conclusions on Paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules

31. As we have set aside Judge Devittie's decision, we are considering  the
    Appellant's Article 8 claim afresh.  In  the  first  instance  this  of
    course entails an application of the facts to  the  Immigration  Rules,
    and in particular Paragraph 276ADE.

32. The Respondent relies on the two factors in Section S-LTR.1.6  and  2.2
    of Appendix FM. As at the date of decision these read:

           S-LTR.1.1. The applicant will be refused limited leave to remain
           on grounds of suitability if any of paragraphs S- LTR.1.2. to
           1.7. apply.

           ...

           S-LTR.1.6. The presence of the applicant in the UK is not
           conducive to the public good because their conduct (including
           convictions which do not fall within paragraphs S-LTR.1.3. to
           1.5.), character, associations, or other reasons, make it
           undesirable to allow them to remain in the UK.

           S-LTR.2.1. The applicant will normally be refused on grounds of
           suitability if any of paragraphs S-LTR.2.2. to 2.4. apply

           ...

           S-LTR.2.2. Whether or not to the applicant's knowledge -

           (a) false information, representations or documents have been
           submitted in relation to the application (including false
           information submitted to any person to obtain a document used in
           support of the application); or

           (b) there has been a failure to disclose material facts in
           relation to the application.

33. In respect of Section S-LTR.1.6, a mandatory ground, we  conclude  that
    in light of our findings of  fact  it  has  not  been  shown  that  the
    Appellant's presence on the United Kingdom  is  not  conducive  to  the
    public good. This basis of refusal does not apply to the Appellant.

34. In respect of Section S-LTR.2.2, there  was  as  a  matter  of  fact  a
    failure to disclose the 2012 conviction.  However,  this  ground  is  a
    discretionary one, and we are entitled to substitute our  own  exercise
    of discretion for that of the Respondent.

35. We have found that the Appellant was unaware of the conviction when the
    application form was completed. There was no deception by the Appellant
    and this clearly counts significantly in her favour.  In  addition,  we
    take account of the absence of any other  convictions,  the  relatively
    minor nature of the 2012 offence, the genuine  remorse  in  respect  of
    that matter, and the very significant amount of time the Appellant  has
    spent in the United Kingdom, together with the ties  that  have  flowed
    from this.

36. Taking all relevant matters into account, we conclude that  in  respect
    of  S-LTR.2.2(a)  and  (b),  discretion  should  be  exercised  in  the
    Appellant's favour. We therefore substitute our discretion for that  of
    the Respondent.

37. Finally, on the facts, sub-paragraph (v) of Paragraph 276ADE is clearly
    satisfied: the Appellant is aged between eighteen and twenty  five  and
    has lived continuously in this country for more than half of her life.

38. Therefore, the Appellant's appeal succeeds under  Paragraph  267ADE  of
    the Immigration Rules. There is no need to consider the Article 8 claim
    outside of the Rules.

Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error of on a point of law.

We set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

We re-make the decision by allowing the appeal under the Immigration Rules.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As we have allowed the appeal  and  because  a  fee  has  been  paid  or  is
payable, we have considered making a fee award and have decided to  make  no
award. Although the Appellant  has  succeeded  in  her  appeal,  the  matter
required further evidence and  the  exercise  of  discretion  by  the  Upper
Tribunal.
