For the Appellant:     Mr Antwi-Bosiako of R Spio Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms Isherwood, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. On 12 September 2019, I issued a decision in which I concluded that the
    First-tier Tribunal  (Judge  Juss)  had  erred  materially  in  law  in
    dismissing the appellant's appeal against the respondent's refusal of a
    Permanent Residence Card.  I do not propose to rehearse the reasons why
    I came to that conclusion.  It suffices for present purposes to  record
    that I set the decision of the FtT aside and directed that  the  appeal
    should be remade in the Upper Tribunal de novo.

Background

 2. The appellant's date of entry to the UK is unclear.  In her application
    for a Permanent Residence Card, she stated that she had met  a  Belgian
    national named Benjamin Ofosy Asante at a party in London on 1 February
    2008.  A relationship had developed and  they  married  (by  proxy,  in
    Ghana)  on  20  February  2010.   They  cohabited  at  an  address   in
    Hertfordshire from 14 February 2009 to 1  September  2011  and  at  the
    appellant's address in Borehamwood thereafter.  They separated and were
    eventually divorced by the pronouncement of a Decree  Absolute  at  the
    Family Court at Watford on 5 August 2015.

 3. The appellant was granted a Residence Card as Mr Asante's family member
    on 12 January 2011.  That card was valid for  the  required  five  year
    period.  On 6 June 2018, she applied  for  a  PRC.   She  provided  the
    details above and stated that the sponsor had worked in  the  UK  since
    2009 and that she had been employed at  all  material  times.   It  was
    submitted that she was entitled to PR and to  a  card  confirming  that
    right.

The Respondent's Decision

 4. The respondent refused the application  on  23  August  2018.   It  was
    accepted that the appellant's marriage to Mr Asante was dissolved on  5
    August 2015.  It was accepted that they had been married for more  than
    three years and that for at least one year they had lived in the United
    Kingdom.  It was also accepted that  the  appellant  had  herself  been
    working in the UK at the date on which the marriage was terminated.  It
    was not accepted, however, that Mr Asante had  been  exercising  Treaty
    Rights when the divorce proceedings were initiated (which was  said  to
    be in June 2015).  Evidence had been submitted to show that  he  worked
    at a restaurant called Taste of  Africa  but  interdepartmental  checks
    disclosed no evidence of any such work.   An HMRC print out  which  had
    been submitted with the application  referred  to  an  employer  called
    Atlas Cleaning but the record showed no end date for  that  employment.
    The interdepartmental  checks  confirmed  that  the  sponsor  exercised
    Treaty Rights from 2010 or 2011 to 30 November 2014 but  there  was  no
    record of economic activity thereafter.  It was not  accepted,  in  the
    circumstances, that the EA national had been exercising  Treaty  Rights
    in June 2015, at which point divorce proceedings  were  initiated.   It
    was not accepted that the appellant had  retained  a  right  to  reside
    under regulation 10, or  that  she  had  acquired  a  right  to  reside
    permanently in the UK thereafter, under regulation 15(1)(f).

Documentary Evidence

 5. In addition to the bundles which were filed and served for the  hearing
    before the First-tier Tribunal, the respondent relied  upon  a  witness
    statement made by Ian Lewis of HMRC on 11 October 2019, detailing  that
    department's records of Mr Asante's economic  activity  in  the  United
    Kingdom from 2009-2017.

Oral Evidence

 6. The appellant confirmed before me that she  had  made  a  statement  in
    March 2019 and that she was aware of its contents, which were true.  Mr
    Antwi-Bosiako asked the appellant whether her husband had been  earning
    money from work at Atlas Cleaning Services in 2011 and 2014.  She  said
    that he was.  She also stated that he had been receiving earnings  from
    a company called Iridium despite what was said in the HMRC documents.

 7. Cross-examined by Ms Isherwood, the appellant stated that she had  last
    seen her husband four years ago.  She corrected herself to say that she
    had not seen him physically at that point but had spoken to him on  the
    telephone.  He had moved out of their property  when  the  relationship
    broke down and she had not seen him after that point in 2015.  She  was
    unable to give an exact date although she  thought  that  it  had  been
    around February that  year.   They  had  separated  acrimoniously  (she
    confirmed to me that she understood the meaning of that word).  It  had
    been  difficult  from  2013  onwards.   Although  they  had   separated
    acrimoniously, the appellant's ex-husband had agreed to help  her  with
    documents to support her claim under  the  EEA  Regulations  through  a
    friend, although there was no evidence from the friend to confirm  this
    role.

 8. Ms Isherwood asked the appellant how she knew  if  her  ex-husband  was
    working in the UK from 2013 onwards.  She said  that  they  were  still
    using the same address and that  the  person  her  husband  was  seeing
    (romantically) used to come to that address, so she (the appellant) had
    moved out for a while so that the situation could calm down  a  little.
    Ms Isherwood suggested to the appellant that she could not  have  known
    if her ex-husband was working or not if she was not  even  living  with
    him.  The appellant stated that she had just  moved  out  for  a  short
    period.  The appellant stated that she had moved out in August 2014 and
    she had done so because her ex-husband was violent  towards  her.   She
    had moved out for  only  two  weeks  and  had  returned  in  August  or
    September that year.  She had returned to the  house  and  had  seen  a
    payslip although she had not seen the detail on that document.  She was
    not aware of any reason why her husband had not been working.  She said
    that his employer had failed to notify HMRC of her husband's  earnings.
    It was clear to her that he had been working; he had in fact been doing
    jobs in the day and at night-time. He used to work at Asda and then  at
    his security job.  Sometimes he did not even come home.  She was unable
    to state what roles her husband had been undertaking beyond 2015 as  he
    had moved out at that point.  Ms  Isherwood  noted  that  HMRC  records
    appeared to show that Mr Asante was working for Asda until 22 May  2012
    but she maintained that he was still working for Asda when  they  lived
    together.  She then changed her evidence to say that she would not know
    who he was working for because she was 'getting the silent  treatment'.
    He had definitely been working for Asda in 2013, however, because  they
    would go shopping there are would go to the canteen together.  She  did
    not know where he was working in 2014 and in 2015  their  communication
    had broken down.

 9. I asked the appellant to clarify her evidence  about  the  document  to
    which Ms Isherwood had referred, which tended to suggest that  her  ex-
    husband had stopped working for Asda in 2012.  She  said  that  he  was
    definitely working as a security guard at that time  and  that  he  had
    definitely been working at Asda in 2013.

10. There was no re-examination from Mr Antwi-Bosiako.

Submissions

11. In submissions, Ms Isherwood said that the appellant  had  not  been  a
    credible witness.  She had a clear lack  of  knowledge  about  her  ex-
    husband's economic activity.  There was no evidence  to  show  that  Mr
    Asante's employers had been at fault in failing to  pay  his  tax.  The
    evidence showed quite clearly that Mr Asante was not in receipt  of  an
    income between  2013  and  2014.   There  was  no  possibility  of  the
    appellant retaining a right to reside in the UK.

12. Mr Antwi-Bosiako submitted that the appellant had been  forthright  and
    honest and that her evidence should  be  accepted  insofar  as  it  was
    suggested that her ex-husband had been working day and night  in  2013.
    The appellant's evidence should be preferred to the records retained by
    Asda Stores and communicated to HMRC  in  relation  to  his  employment
    there.  There were clear inaccuracies in the history given by HMRC.  It
    was open to the Tribunal to accept the appellant's evidence.  If it was
    found by the Tribunal that the evidence did not show economic  activity
    throughout the requisite  period,  such  gaps  were  permitted  by  the
    Directive  and  the  Regulations.   Mr  Antwi-Bosiako  submitted   that
    regulation 3 or regulation 5(4) could come to the  appellant's  aid  in
    this respect.  It would also be open to the Tribunal to  conclude  that
    he was a jobseeker during any gap.  I  suggested  to  Mr  Antwi-Bosiako
    that none of these exceptions appeared  to  apply  to  the  appellant's
    case.  He accepted that none applied 'on the letter of the Regulations'
    but he was trying, he said, to draw analogies.  In any event, Mr Antwi-
    Bosiako submitted that there was some documentary evidence to show that
    the appellant's ex-husband was working in 2015.   There  were  payslips
    which appeared in the bundle.  If these were accepted, they were highly
    material to the question of whether the appellant had retained a  right
    to reside in the UK upon divorce.

13. I reserved my decision.



Analysis

14. It is for the appellant to establish on the civil standard that she  is
    entitled either to a retained right to reside in the United Kingdom  or
    that she has a right to reside in this country  permanently  under  the
    Citizens Directive.

15. The concern which prompted me to set aside the decision of  the  First-
    tier was that it had failed to consider  whether  the  appellant's  ex-
    husband had acquired the right to reside permanently in  the  UK  under
    regulation 15(1)(a), since any such  conclusion  would  potentially  be
    material to the appellant's own position.  Regulation 15(1)(a) provides
    that "an EEA  national  who  has  resided  in  the  United  Kingdom  in
    accordance with these Regulations  for  a  continuous  period  of  five
    years" shall  acquire  the  right  to  reside  in  the  United  Kingdom
    permanently.

16. HMRC's records of Mr Asante's economic activity in the  United  Kingdom
    are presented as a table in Mr Lewis's witness statement.   That  table
    is as follows:

17. There is also a letter containing HMRC records in respect of Mr Asante.
     That letter, dated 11 February 2015, was submitted in support  of  the
    original application.  It provides a little more detail in  respect  of
    the years 2010 to 2014.  It also provides the following data in respect
    of the tax year ending 5 April 2009:

Employer |Reference  |Start date |End date |Pay |Tax  |Tax code  |  |Crystal
Services Ltd |961/9912802  |11/02/2009  |11/02/2009  |�480  |�0.00  |603L  |
|E901 Realisations Ltd |419/EZ63691  |23/02/2009  |02/12/2009  |�979  |�0.00
|603L | |Mitie Cleaning (South West) Ltd |034/M2246 |15/02/2009  |27/03/2009
|�690 |�0.00 |603LX | |Adecco  UK  Ltd  |951/AD220  |20/12/2008  |27/02/2009
|�177 |�35.40 |BRX | |These tables show that the appellant's ex-husband  was
18. economically active in the United Kingdom  from  20  December  2008  to
    April 2013.  It suggests that he was not economically  active  in  this
    country beyond April 2013, from which point he is not recorded to  have
    earned any money  or  paid  any  tax.   There  was  no  basis  for  the
    respondent to conclude, as she did in the letter of  refusal,  that  Mr
    Asante exercised Treaty Rights in the United Kingdom until 30  November
    2014.  That error appears to have arisen, as  I  noted  in  my  earlier
    decision, from the fact that the expanded version of the table above  -
    which was submitted in support of the  original  application  -  states
    that the end date of Mr Asante's employment with Iridium 2005  Ltd  was
    stated to be "30/11/2014".  He is not recorded to have earned any money
    for that company, however, and merely being registered with an employer
    will not suffice.

19. The appellant submits that the HMRC records do  not  reflect  the  true
    position.  She submits that her ex-husband continued  working  in  this
    country, at least until the point at which they separated in 2015.   If
    that is established to be the case, it would show that he had  acquired
    Permanent Residence on 20 December 2013.

20. The evidential basis upon  which  Mr  Antwi-Bosiako  submits  that  the
    appellant's ex-husband worked beyond the point suggested  by  the  HMRC
    records is as  follows.   There  is  a  letter  from  a  restaurant  in
    Nottingham called Taste of Africa, enclosing copies  of  payslips  from
    April 2015 to November 2015.  These show, or purportedly show, that  Mr
    Asante earned �816 in each of these months, for 96  hours  of  work  at
    �8.50 per hour.  The payslips show his National  Insurance  number  and
    give sums on which tax and NI was payable.  In respect  of  the  period
    between April 2013 and April 2015, however,  there  is  no  documentary
    evidence of economic activity on the part  of  Mr  Asante.   Mr  Antwi-
    Bosiako is dependent, for this period, on  the  oral  evidence  of  the
    appellant alone.

21. In respect of the period between April 2013 and April 2015, my  finding
    is as follows.  In circumstances  in  which  HMRC  have  no  record  of
    economic  activity  beyond  that  point,  I  do  not  accept  that  the
    appellant's oral evidence suffices to discharge the burden  of  proving
    that her ex-husband was economically active in this period.   She  said
    that he would always go out to work until they split up in 2015 but the
    documentary evidence before me simply does not support that  assertion.
    Her evidence of where he worked and who he worked for was rather vague.
     That is perhaps unsurprising if, as she maintains, their  relationship
    was strained between 2013 and 2015,  but  the  burden  remains  on  the
    appellant and she has  provided  no  proper  basis  -  whether  in  her
    documentary evidence or her  oral  evidence  -  on  which  to  found  a
    conclusion that Mr Asante remained economically active beyond the  end-
    point noted in the HMRC material.   Whilst  I  am  content  to  accept,
    therefore, that he was economically active between 20 December 2008 and
    the end of the tax year in 2013, that leaves him  some  months  shy  of
    accruing the five years residence in accordance  with  the  regulations
    which is required.

22. Undeterred, Mr Antwi-Bosiako submitted that there were various means by
    which he could nevertheless show that the appellant's ex-husband should
    be taken to have continued exercising his Treaty Rights in  the  United
    Kingdom up to and including 20 December 2013, at which point  he  would
    have acquired a right to reside permanently in the  UK.   He  submitted
    that Mr Asante was a jobseeker during between April 2013  and  December
    2013.  Leaving to one side the fact that this submission  was  contrary
    to his primary case and the evidence given  by  his  client,  the  fact
    remains that there is no evidence to show either that  he  was  seeking
    work during that time, or that he was registered as such,  or  that  he
    had a genuine chance  of  being  engaged  during  that  time.   On  the
    evidence before me, he was not conceivably a jobseeker as defined.

23. Mr Antwi-Bosiako  also  submitted  that  regulation  3  (Continuity  of
    Residence) somehow applied in order to bridge this eight-month gap.  As
    I suggested to him at the hearing, however,  that  regulation  concerns
    temporary absences from the UK, not absence  of  evidence  of  economic
    activity.   Mr  Antwi-Bosiako  then  went  to  regulation  5(4),  which
    concerns those who are working in  another  EEA  state.   There  is  no
    evidence in this case that Mr Asante  ever  left  the  UK  to  work  in
    another EEA state and that  submission  is  directly  contrary  to  the
    appellant's account.  Recognising the problems with these  submissions,
    Mr  Antwi-Bosiako  accepted  that  none  of  these  provisions  applied
    directly.  He submitted that they apply by analogy to  the  appellant's
    circumstances, however.  That cannot be right.  The Directive  and  the
    Regulations contain a scheme of rights and protections which  apply  to
    individuals in the circumstances therein described.  There is no  vague
    penumbra of the kind relied upon by Mr Antwi-Bosiako, and he was unable
    to develop this submission with reference to any domestic authority  or
    jurisprudence from the CJEU.

24. Drawing these threads together, I come to the clear conclusion that the
    appellant cannot establish that her  ex-husband  acquired  a  right  to
    reside permanently in the UK between 2008 and 2013.  The importance  of
    that finding is that the appellant cannot establish, as  was  submitted
    by Mr Antwi-Bosiako, that she acquired a right to reside permanently in
    the UK under regulation 15(1)(b).  That is because she cannot show that
    she resided in the UK with an  EEA  national  in  accordance  with  the
    Regulations for a continuous period of five  years.   They  married  in
    February 2010 and lived together in  the  UK  in  accordance  with  the
    Regulations until the end of the tax year in 2013 but she did  not,  on
    the facts as I have found them, continue to accrue qualifying residence
    beyond that point.  Insofar  as  the  appellant  relied  on  regulation
    15(1)(b), therefore, her appeal must be dismissed.

25. That leaves the submission that  the  appellant  retained  a  right  to
    reside in the UK under regulation  10(5)  upon  divorce  and  that  she
    qualified for permanent residence as a result  of  regulation  15(1(f).
    It has been accepted throughout that regulation 10(6) is satisfied.  It
    is clear that the appellant herself is a  hard-working  woman  who  has
    made a contribution to the UK  economy.   The  material  questions  are
    instead those posed by regulation 10(5)(a) and (b) of the  Regulations,
    read alonside Baigazieva [2018] EWCA Civ 1088; [2018] Imm AR 1221.

26. It is therefore necessary to consider the appellant's evidence that her
    ex-husband was working in 2015.   To  recap,  it  is  said  that  their
    relationship broke down at the start of that year (possibly  February),
    the petition for divorce was presented on 6 March 2015 and the marriage
    was divorced by the pronouncement of a  decree  absolute  on  5  August
    2015.  There is no adequate evidence, as I have already  explained,  to
    show that the appellant's ex-husband was economically active  in  March
    2015.  The HMRC records show no economic activity at that  point.   The
    appellant's own evidence is vague and unsatisfactory on the point.  The
    evidence from Taste of Africa restaurant  purportedly  shows  that  the
    appellant's ex-husband was paid for work in the months  April  2015  to
    December 2015, and not before.  I conclude, therefore, that  Mr  Asante
    was not economically active and was not a qualified person  in  the  UK
    when divorce proceedings were initiated.

27. Nor do I accept, in any event, that the records from  Taste  of  Africa
    restaurant in Nottingham suffice to establish  on  the  civil  standard
    that Mr Asante was working in 2015.  There is no  record  of  any  such
    employment held by HMRC.  There is merely a  bare  assertion  that  his
    employment was not reported to HMRC and that no tax or NI was  paid  in
    respect of his employment but that is a serious allegation against  the
    claimed employer and there is nothing before me to  show  that  it  has
    been put to the claimed employer or raised with  HMRC.   The  appellant
    maintains that she was able to secure this  evidence  by  engaging  the
    assistance of a mutual friend  but  there  is  no  evidence  from  that
    person, confirming the provenance of  the  payslips  and  the  covering
    letter.  The letter and the payslips stand alone and are at  odds  with
    the records kept by HMRC.  For all of these reasons, I do not  consider
    the documents from Taste of Africa restaurant to be  reliable  evidence
    that Mr Asante was working in the United Kingdom in 2015, at any  point
    during the divorce proceedings between him and the appellant.

28. It follows that Mr Asante was not a qualified person and  that  he  and
    the appellant were not residing in the  United  Kingdom  in  accordance
    with the Regulations at any point in  2015.   She  did  not,  in  those
    circumstances, retain a right to reside in the UK upon her divorce from
    him.  She cannot satisfy regulation 10(5) and she cannot, as a  result,
    satisfy regulation 15(1)(f).

29. In the circumstances, I come to the clear conclusion that the appellant
    does not have a retained right to reside in the UK or a right to reside
    permanently in the UK.  Her appeal will be dismissed accordingly.
