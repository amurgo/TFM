Representation:
For the Appellants:    Miss A Patyna, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr L Tarlow, HOPO


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellants have been granted permission to appeal the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Jerromes to dismiss their appeals against the
    decision of the respondent refusing to grant them leave  to  remain  on
    Article 8 family and/or private life.

2.   The appellants are all nationals of Sri Lanka.  The  first  and  second
    appellants are married and have two children.  Their eldest child, [S],
    was born on [ ] 2009 and is now 7 years old.  Their youngest child  [J]
    was born on [ ] 2013 in the United  Kingdom.   Both  children  are  Sri
    Lankan nationals.

3.   The first appellant entered the UK on 6 May 2010  as  a  student.   The
    second appellant and third appellant [S] entered the UK on the same day
    as her dependants.

4.   The first appellant completed her course of study and on 31 March  2014
    she was awarded a Graduate Diploma in Healthcare Management.  When  [J]
    was born the  first  appellant  had  no  opportunity  to  continue  her
    studies.

5.   The second appellant is employed at Tesco Express  as  a  team  leader.
    He has worked there since 12 October 2012.  His income  is  �1,100  per
    month.  They pay �600 rent per month and are in receipt of tax  credit.



6.   [J] has been diagnosed with "exceptional medical  conditions"  and  has
    had surgeries and course of treatments.  These were highlighted by  the
    judge at paragraphs 20 to 26.  Because of [J]'s medical conditions,  it
    is likely that as he gets older, the gap between him and his peers will
    widen.  It was said that if the family return to Sri  Lanka,  "all  the
    medical proceedings will be disrupted causing  adverse  effect  to  the
    development of the child".  At the hearing, the  second  appellant  was
    asked if he had made enquiries about suitable facilities in Sri  Lanka;
    he replied that he had spoken to a doctor and facilities were available
    but some needed to be paid for.  He also said that [J] was not  on  any
    medication.  The second appellant confirmed that with the exception  of
    the genes test, the issue was not whether facilities were available but
    whether they could pay for the facilities.

7.    The  first  appellant  was  asked  under  cross-examination  if  [J]'s
    conditions were life threatening and she accepted that they  were  not.
    She said she was worried about how people will look at [J] in Sri Lanka
    and it will upset and ruin her and the children.  The second  appellant
    said he has not told anyone at home about [J] because of  the  negative
    way people in Sri Lanka think about such things.  He knows this because
    a member of his sister-in-law's family has a disabled 13-year-old  son.



8.   Submissions were made on behalf of  the  appellants  that  it  was  not
    reasonable to expect [S] to leave the UK as it is in her best interests
    to remain in the UK.  She is attending school and is  doing  well  with
    excellent  attendance.   In  May  2017  [S]  will  have   been   living
    continuously in the UK for seven years.  She has spent  over  half  her
    life here, including the "better part of  her  formative  years".   Her
    education, hobbies and friendships will all be severely disrupted;  she
    does not speak or write Sinhalese.  They cannot imagine [S] being  able
    to reintegrate into Sri Lankan society.  If  they  moved  back  to  Sri
    Lanka they would be in a tremendously difficult financial situation  as
    they would not be able  to  support  themselves  and  this  is  a  life
    threatening factor for [J].

9.   The judge heard evidence from Ms Anne Marie Brooks who is  employed  at
    the  Archbishop  Lanfranc  Academy   Nursery   in   Croydon   as   Team
    Leader/Special Educational Needs Co-ordinator.  She  has  worked  there
    for nine years.  She gave evidence that  [J]  has  been  attending  the
    nursery since 6 September 2016.  She stated that  due  to  his  complex
    medical issues and individual needs he is eligible for High Level Needs
    Funding.  She also said that [J] has an individual educational plan and
    has professional keyworkers  working  alongside  his  parents  and  the
    nursery to ensure he receives the specialist care that  he  needs.   Ms
    Brooks said she has done some research about facilities  in  Sri  Lanka
    and has come across a UNICEF report.  From this  she  understands  that
    there are some specialist centres but the tendency is to integrate  SEN
    children into mainstream schools and she fears that  [J]  would  become
    lost in the system.  She said that [J]'s needs  would  increase  as  he
    gets older and the gap widens  between  him  and  his  peers.   He  may
    develop behaviour problems due to his frustration  with  difficulty  in
    communicating.

10.  There was a significant volume of documentation in  relation  to  [J]'s
    various  medical  issues  before  the  judge.   The  judge  listed  the
    documents at paragraphs 41 and 42.  These included letters from various
    medical professionals.

11.   At  paragraph  43  the  judge  accepted  the  appellants'  immigration
    history.  She also accepted in light  of  the  respondent's  assertions
    that Sri Lanka has a functioning education system  which  the  children
    would be able to enter.  In light of  Ms  Brooks'  evidence  the  judge
    accepted that with regard to [J] there are some specialist centres  but
    the tendency is to integrate SEN children into mainstream schools.  The
    judge also accepted that [J]  undoubtedly  suffers  from  a  number  of
    medical  conditions  which  are  comprehensively   rehearsed   in   the
    supporting documents from various medical professionals.

12.  In conclusion the judge found that Sri Lanka has  a  healthcare  system
    capable of assisting and providing treatment for [J]'s  conditions  and
    suitable medical treatment is available.  She accepted that his medical
    care would initially be disrupted but found that provision is available
    in Sri Lanka, albeit at a cost.  She did  not  accept  that  on  return
    there was a risk of a decline in his condition(s) which would result in
    intense suffering or a significant reduction in his life expectancy.

13.  The judge found that the appellants still have family  and  other  ties
    in Sri Lanka.  The first appellant has four  brothers  and  a  paternal
    uncle in Sri Lanka and they have returned to Sri Lanka on at least  two
    occasions, most recently in 2013 to attend a wedding.  She  found  also
    that as the second appellant previously worked as a chef in  Sri  Lanka
    for about ten years, and in the absence of any supporting evidence, the
    judge found that there was no reason to conclude he would be unable  to
    find work on return to Sri Lanka either as a chef  or  similar  to  his
    current role with Tesco.

14.  The judge accepted on the evidence that in  Sri  Lanka  there  is  some
    stigmatisation  of  people  with  disabilities  and  that   this   will
    exacerbate the appellants' difficulties in adjusting  to  life  in  Sri
    Lanka.  She did not accept that the level of stigmatisation will be  so
    severe as to ruin their lives, as is set out by the first appellant.

15.  The appellants have not challenged any of the above findings.

16.  Their challenge is to the judge's finding that although it would be  in
    the best interests of [S] and [J] to remain in the UK, it would not  be
    unreasonable to expect them to leave the UK.

17.  The judge, relying on Azimi-Moayed and others, held at paragraph  50(v)
    that at 3 and 7 years old, [J] and [S] remain largely reliant on  their
    parents and their world  is  still  very  much  focused  on  them.   At
    paragraph 50.3, weighing up all the factors that were before  her,  the
    judge  held  that  relocation  to  Sri  Lanka  would  not  involve  any
    separation of family life and limited disruption to their private  life
    given their young age.  She went on to say:

         "However, it must be in [J]'s best interests to remain  in  the  UK
         given the significant professional support he is receiving  in  the
         UK and the disruption (although not cessation) of that  support  if
         he relocates to Sri Lanka.  It is also (marginally) in  [S]'s  best
         interests to remain in the UK in view of the fact that she has been
         here six years and has established a limited degree of private life
         and her first language is English."

18.  The judge went on to say at paragraph 51 that whilst  having  concluded
    that it is in the children's best interests to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom, in determining whether or not it is reasonable to  expect  the
    children to leave the UK, she  must  also  consider  the  wider  public
    interest factors.

19.   She  considered  that  the  first  and  second  appellants  have  been
    overstayers since 22 September 2014.  However, they have  made  efforts
    albeit belatedly to regularise their immigration status and this is not
    therefore a factor which weighs heavily.  She noted that  [S]  and  [J]
    have been educated at public expense.  [J] is being treated by the  NHS
    at  public  expense.   The  second  appellant  has  in  the  main  been
    supporting his family but they have had recourse to public  funds  (tax
    credits) and it is reasonable to assume they will continue  to  do  so.
    She noted that there were no issues with regard to the first or  second
    appellant's character.  Both the  first  and  second  appellants  speak
    fluent English.  Having weighed up all the above factors, the judge was
    satisfied that it would be reasonable for both [J] and [S] to go to Sri
    Lanka.  The fact that [J] is in receipt  of  high  level  care  from  a
    number of medical professionals in the UK, does not outweigh the public
    interest factors as adequate  care  is  available  in  Sri  Lanka.   It
    follows that it would also be reasonable for [S] to go to Sri Lanka.

20.  The judge concluded by saying that  the  decision  does  not  interfere
    with the family life of the appellants as they will be returning  as  a
    family unit.  She accepted however that the  decision  interferes  with
    their private life given the length of time that they have been in  the
    UK.  She accepted that the interference with their private life is more
    than merely technical or  academic  and  Article  8  is  engaged.   Her
    decision however is in accordance with the law  and  in  pursuit  of  a
    legitimate aim that there should be a  system  of  immigration  control
    which is enforced  is  necessary  in  a  well-ordered  society  in  the
    interests of all.  Based on an overall consideration of the facts,  the
    judge  was  satisfied  that  the  decision  is  proportionate  to   the
    legitimate aims pursued and does not breach the Article 8 rights of the
    appellants and/or [J] for reasons given at paragraphs 54 and 55.   That
    the appellants have failed to demonstrate that [J] is likely to  suffer
    degrading and inhuman treatment likely to reach the very high threshold
    in Article 3 if he returned to Sri Lanka.  Although [S] has now been in
    the UK for seven years, and is a qualifying child, and  has  a  genuine
    and  subsisting  relationship  with  her  parents,  it  would  not   be
    unreasonable to expect [S] to leave the UK.

21.  The judge further found that the appellants have failed to  demonstrate
    that [J] is likely to suffer degrading and inhuman treatment likely  to
    reach the very high threshold in Article 3 if returned  to  Sri  Lanka.
    He is not critically ill and close to death.  There is  no  risk  of  a
    decline in his condition which would result in intense suffering  or  a
    significant reduction in life expectancy.  There  is  adequate  medical
    care available in Sri Lanka.

22.  The judge accepted at paragraph 55 that life on  return  to  Sri  Lanka
    may be hard against that he is mandated to weigh the  very  significant
    burden arising from [J]'s treatment and  the  cost  of  educating  both
    children.

23.  Miss Patyna relied on "Counsel's note" which she had prepared  for  the
    hearing.  She said the sole ground of appeal is that the judge erred in
    her assessment  of  whether  it  would  be  reasonable  for  the  third
    appellant ([S]) to be removed from the UK in the context where she is a
    qualifying child within the meaning of Section 117B of the Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 ("highlight the 2002 Act").  She argued
    that the judge failed to have regard to the authority of MA  (Pakistan)
    v SSHD [2016] EWCA Civ 705 and consequently  failed  to  recognise  the
    weight to be attached to the seven year period of  [S]'s  residence  in
    the UK, and treat it as a starting point to leave being granted  unless
    there are strong reasons to the contrary.

24.  Miss Patyna accepted that the seven-year Rule was acknowledged  by  the
    judge when she said at paragraph 50.2(v) that the seven-year  threshold
    in Appendix FM recognises that over time children  start  to  put  down
    roots and integrate into life in the UK.  At 3 and 7 years old, [J] and
    [S] remain largely reliant on their parents and their  world  is  still
    very much focused on them.  Miss Patyna  submitted  that  this  finding
    fell short of the requirements at paragraph 46 of MA  (Pakistan)  where
    the Court of Appeal held that after such a period  of  time  the  child
    would  have  put  down  roots  and  developed  social,   cultural   and
    educational links in the UK  such  that  it  is  likely  to  be  highly
    disruptive if the child is required to leave  the  UK.   She  submitted
    that there was no further recognition by the judge of  the  seven  year
    period being a powerful factor against removal and/or a starting  point
    for leave to be granted in the absence of strong  reasons.   The  judge
    failed to recognise the strength of the ties and roots  developed  over
    that period.

25.  Miss Patyna submitted that the judge's  comment  about  the  seven-year
    period is immediately diluted by her reference to  Azimi-Moayed  [2013]
    UKUT 00197 (IAC) which predates MA.  She said this is followed  by  the
    judge's failure to draw a proper distinction between  the  position  of
    [S] who has been in the UK for seven years and [J] who has not but  the
    judge then finds that both children's world is  very  much  focused  on
    their parents.  Miss Patyna submitted that it must be incorrect to  say
    that because the younger child has to go then the first  child  has  to
    also go.  It was  incumbent  upon  the  judge  to  differentiate  [S]'s
    position from that of [J] because she is a qualifying child.

26.  Miss Patyna said  that  the  judge  said  there  were  public  interest
    factors but did not  say  that  they  were  strong  and  powerful.   At
    paragraph 51.1(i) the  judge  considered  that  the  first  and  second
    appellants have been overstayers since 22 September 2014 but that  they
    had made efforts  rather  belatedly  to  regularise  their  immigration
    status.  However the judge found that  this  was  not  a  factor  which
    weighed heavily against them.  The judge said the children  were  being
    educated at public expense and that [J] was being treated by the NHS at
    public expense.  Miss Patyna  said  that  these  factors  were  not  so
    powerful.  The seven year Rule recognises the educational links and the
    fact that they would be publicly educated in any event.  She  submitted
    that the reasons given by the judge were not powerful enough.

27.  Mr Tarlow submitted that the seven-year Rule  is  not  a  determinative
    factor.  It is merely a factor of some weight.  He submitted  that  the
    grounds were a disagreement with the reasoned and valid  findings  made
    by the judge.  The judge carefully took into  account  the  educational
    needs and medical evidence.  At paragraph 54.3 the judge said the first
    and second appellants have put  down  roots  in  the  UK  in  the  full
    knowledge that their stay here is at best precarious and little  weight
    should be given to private life established when a person is in the  UK
    unlawfully or  their  immigration  status  is  precarious.   Mr  Tarlow
    submitted that taken as a whole,  the  determination  was  sound.   The
    judge has balanced the needs of the family,  in  particular  the  child
    with medical issues, against the public interest  and  has  come  to  a
    conclusion that is open to her to make.  He submitted that  the  public
    interest outweighs the interests of the family.

Findings

28.  I accept that the judge did not make reference to MA (Pakistan) in  her
    decision.  However, I was not persuaded that the judge made an error of
    law as I found that her approach was not  dissimilar  to  the  approach
    adopted by the Court of Appeal in MA (Pakistan).

29.  I have highlighted  the  evidence  that  the  judge  accepted  and  her
    findings.  The judge's finding that it would be in the  best  interests
    of  the  children  to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  has  not  been
    challenged.  It is the judge's finding that it is not unreasonable  for
    the whole family including [S] and [J] to go to Sri Lanka that has  led
    to this challenge by the appellants.   In  reaching  her  findings  the
    judge considered the wider public interest factors.  She  listed  these
    factors at paragraph 51.1.  The judge did not place too much weight  on
    the immigration status of the first and second  appellants.   She  said
    that [S] and [J] have been educated at public expense.  Whilst I accept
    Miss Patyna's submission that a child who has  been  here  seven  years
    would be receiving an education in the UK, I agree with the judge  that
    the education would be at public expense.   I note that  the  Court  of
    Appeal said at paragraph 46 that after such a period  the  child  would
    have put down roots and  developed  social,  cultural  and  educational
    links in the UK such that it is likely to be highly disruptive  if  the
    child is required to leave the UK.  Nevertheless, the Court  of  Appeal
    went on to say that this may be less so  when  the  children  are  very
    young because the focus of their lives will be on their  families,  but
    the disruption becomes more serious as they get  older.   I  find  that
    this part of the judgement resonates with the judge's finding that at 3
    and 7 years old, [J] and [S] remain largely reliant  on  their  parents
    and their world is still very much focused on them.

29.  I accept that children being educated at public  expense  is  a  factor
    common to most cases involving the seven year Rule, and should  not  on
    its own be treated as powerful/significant  to  outweigh  the  starting
    point that leave should be granted.  However, this  was  not  the  only
    wider public interest factor that was considered by the judge.

30.  I was not persuaded  by  Miss  Patyna's  submission  that  the  judge's
    reasoning that [J]'s medical care at public  expense  is  a  factor  in
    favour of removal (and  to  be  taken  account  in  the  assessment  of
    reasonableness of [S]'s removal) is an  approach  that  is  unfair  and
    discriminatory in respect of [S]'s position.  It was open to the  judge
    to take this evidence into account when considering  the  wider  public
    interest factors.  Just as the judge was entitled to take into  account
    that the family has had recourse to public funds when  Section  117B(3)
    requires that those seeking to remain  under  article  8  of  the  ECHR
    should be financially independent and are not a burden on the taxpayer.

31.  I was not persuaded by Miss Patyna's submission that the  judge  failed
    to distinguish between [S]'s position and [J]'s position.  I find  that
    the judge dealt with each child separately.  The judge  held  that  [S]
    has lived in the UK for seven years and is a qualified child; that  her
    parents have a genuine and subsisting relationship with [S].    I  note
    that there was not much evidence about [S], other than her age,  length
    of residence and education in the UK.  There  was  much  more  evidence
    about [J].  I find that the judge may not have devoted a  paragraph  or
    two to considering only [S]'s circumstances, but I find that  this  was
    not an error because on the limited evidence in respect of [S], I  find
    that the judge's findings were sustainable.  In any event, the argument
    that because [S] she has lived in the UK continuously for  seven  years
    and that it would be unreasonable to disrupt  her  life  here  and  her
    education raises [S]'s position to  that  of  being  the  determinative
    factor, it is not.  It is a factor to be  taken  into  account  in  the
    wholistic consideration of this appeal.

32.  I find that the  judge  balanced  the  needs  of  the  family  and  the
    children against the public interest and came to a conclusion that  was
    open to her to make.
