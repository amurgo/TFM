                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent



                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan and appeals against  a  decision
    of the respondent dated 31 December 2015 to refuse to issue a residence
    card as confirmation of a right of  residence  as  an  extended  family
    member of an EEA national.

 2. In a decision promulgated on 5 April 2017 a  judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal  ("FtT)  dismissed  the  appeal  for  want  of   jurisdiction,
    concluding that in the light of Sala (EFMs:  Right  of  Appeal)  [2016]
    UKUT 00411 (IAC) the FtT did not  have  jurisdiction  to  consider  the
    appeal.

 3. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal  has  been  granted,  and  a
    hearing date of 21 December 2017 has been fixed. However,  the  parties
    are agreed that in the light of the decision of the Court of Appeal  in
    Khan v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017] EWCA Civ 1755,
    which found that Sala was  wrongly  decided,  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge  ("FtJ")  erred  in  law  in  concluding  that  the  FtT  had  no
    jurisdiction to consider the appeal.

 4. In the circumstances, and in the light of Khan, I am satisfied that the
    FtJ erred in law, that her decision should be set aside  and  that  the
    appeal be remitted to the FtT for a hearing de novo.  Plainly  the  FtJ
    was unaware of the decision in Khan, and applied  the  law  as  it  was
    thought to be at the time she considered the matter.



    Decision

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    on a point of law. Its decision is set aside and the appeal remitted to
    the First-tier Tribunal for a hearing de novo before a judge other than
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Herlihy.
