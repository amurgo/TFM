                       (ANONYMITY DIRECTION NOT MADE)
                                                                 Respondents


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms A Everett
For the Respondents:   In person


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is the appeal of the Secretary of State but I will  refer  to  the
    original  appellants  as  the  appellants  herein.   The  first   named
    appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born  on  30  April  1983,  and  the
    second named appellant is her daughter who was born on 3 June 2009.   A
    reference to the appellant is a reference to the first named appellant.

2.   The appellant arrived in April 2007 as a Tier 4 Student  Migrant.   She
    applied on 12 April 2014 for leave as a Tier 4  (General)  Student  but
    this application was refused on 1 May 2014 on the following ground:

         "(a) Miss Tajuddin failed to meet  the  requirements  of  paragraph
             245ZX  (d)  because  she  was  not  awarded  10   points   for
             Maintenance (Funds).  This is because she was required to show
             that she was in possession of �3,603.16 for a  consecutive  28
             day period.

         (b)  She submitted her bank statements and  the  closing  date  was
             1/04/2014 and therefore the 28 day period ran from  05/03/2014
             to 01/04/2014.  However on 07/03/2014 she only  had  �3,285.73
             in her account and she has therefore not demonstrated she  has
             the required funds available".

3.   The appellants appealed against the decision  and  their  appeals  came
    before a First-tier  Judge  on  12  January  2015  with  the  appellant
    appearing in person before him as she did before me.

4.   The judge reached his conclusions in a commendably brief  determination
    as follows:

         "8.  Miss Tajuddin relied on her bank statement ending  11th  April
             2014 which shows that she had sufficient funds in her  account
             for in excess of a consecutive 28 day period from  10th  March
             to 11th April 2014 which pre dates her application (dated 12th
             April 2014).  The Appellant  also  relied  on  her  notice  of
             appeal which states she sent in an earlier bank  statement  in
             error and it is clear that  she  meets  the  requirements  and
             should be awarded the 10 points for Maintenance (Funds).

         9.   The Respondent relied on the Home Office bundle and the letter
             of refusal.

         10.  I heard oral evidence from Miss Tajuddin and submissions  from
             her and Mr Lumb.

         11.  Miss Tajuddin conceded that she had not produced  the  correct
             bank statements with her application, but one  ending  on  1st
             April which did not have the correct amount in her account  28
             days preceding the end date of the  statement.   However,  she
             did have 28  consecutive  days  worth  of  accounts  with  the
             correct amount which pre-dated her application but had sent an
             earlier account in error.

         12.  The Respondent's case is that Miss Tajuddin  did  not  provide
             the correct statements and therefore does not qualify for  the
             points as set out in the reason for refusal letter.

         Findings

         13.  Miss Tajuddin made her application on 12/04/2014.

         14.   With  her  application  Miss  Tajuddin  provided   statements
             covering a 28 day period from 05/03/2014  to  01/04/2014.   On
             07/03/2014 the amount in her account fell to �3,285.73 and was
             therefore lower than the required amount  of  �3,603.16  which
             covers �2,000 living costs for herself,  �1,200  living  costs
             for  her  dependant,  the   second   Appellant   and   �403.16
             outstanding course fees.

         15.   With  her  appeal  she  submitted  her  later  original  bank
             statement  which  ended  11/04/2014,   which   pre-dates   her
             application and they clearly show the required amount  in  her
             account  for  a  consecutive  32  day  period  prior  to   her
             application.  The lowest figure  is  �3,610.89  on  31/03/2014
             rising to �4,610.89 on 10/04/2014.

         16.  I find that Miss Tajuddin did have  the  required  maintenance
             funds in her account for a consecutive 28 day period prior  to
             her application on 12/04/2014.  I  therefore  find  that  this
             constitutes an exceptional case as the case falls within 245AA
             and that Miss Tajuddin has  established  that  she  meets  the
             maintenance requirements.

         17.  Given that  I  have  found  that  the  application  should  be
             exceptionally granted and the specified documents are  genuine
             and Miss Tajuddin meets all the other requirements, I did  not
             need to go on to consider  whether  there  is  any  evidential
             flexibility".

5.   The appeal was allowed.  The Secretary of State applied for  permission
    to appeal.  The application for permission was refused  by  the  First-
    tier Tribunal.  However the application was renewed and on 23 May  2015
    Upper Tribunal Judge Chalkley granted permission.  Reliance was  placed
    by the respondent on the case of Han v Secretary of State  [2014]  EWHC
    4606 (Admin) and in particular paragraphs 12 to  15  of  that  decision
    which it is convenient to set out here:

         "12. In submissions on behalf of the claimant, Mr Mold advances two
             grounds.  The first is the failure to apply  paragraph  245AA.
             He contends that this was a case of a document that was in the
             wrong format, consequently  the  applicant  should  have  been
             requested to submit it in the right format, in other words,  a
             bank statement which would have  finished  its  entries  on  3
             September such that the applicant could have demonstrated that
             she had the requisite �7,200 in the account.   He  quotes  the
             decision of Simler J in R (on  the  application  of  Patel)  v
             Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2014]  EWHC  1861
             admin, that 'format' means the way something  is  arranged  or
             set out.  In Mr Mold's submission the bank  statement  was  in
             the wrong format in that it was dated 9 September.  If it  had
             been set out differently, the  Immigration  Rules  would  have
             been  satisfied.   The  applicant  could  quite  easily   have
             obtained a further statement to satisfy the rules.

         13.  In my view this argument goes nowhere.  To my mind this  is  a
             document which was not in the wrong format.  The fact is  that
             it did not contain the correct information.  It had to contain
             information demonstrating that the applicant had at  the  date
             of the statement, 9 September, that  she  had  �7,200  in  her
             account.  Unfortunately she had paid the rent, as we now know,
             which reduced the balance below.  But the fact is that  giving
             paragraph 245AA its  natural  and  ordinary  meaning,  and  in
             circumstances where a rigid  application  of  the  immigration
             rules is necessary -- a  point  underlined  by  the  Court  of
             Appeal in Miah v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department
             [2012] EWCA Civ 261 -- this ground fails; see  in  addition  R
             (on the application of Gu) v Secretary of State for  the  Home
             Department [2014] EWHC 1634 at paragraphs 23 and 24.

         14.  Mr Mold's second point  is  that  the  evidential  flexibility
             policy should have been applied in this case.  If applied  the
             policy would have led to the Secretary of State requiring  the
             claimant to request a bank statement which showed the  balance
             available up to 3  September.   Because  the  application  was
             late, the requirement  that  the  applicant  have  �7,200  was
             triggered.  This was an otherwise compliant application -- the
             only gap being the full amount was not in the account  on  9th
             September.  It was apparent, in Mr Mold's submission, that the
             missing document could be obtained.

         15.  In my view the evidential flexibility policy does not apply in
             this sort of situation.   It  is  designed  to  address  minor
             errors and omissions.  The basic point is that  there  was  no
             omission or minor error here.   The  fact  is  that  the  bank
             statement did not contain the requisite information".

6.   Ms Everett submitted that the appellant had mistakenly not sent in  the
    bank statement with her application.  The First-tier Judge had erred in
    finding that paragraph 245AA applied.  The omitted document was not one
    of a series and there was no issue  with  the  formatting.   There  was
    nothing exceptional about the circumstances.  The determination  should
    be remade in the Secretary of State's favour.

7.   The appellant submitted that she had the  requisite  funds  which  were
    present in the bank and the missing part formed part of a sequence.

8.   Ms Everett submitted that the appellant  could  not  benefit  from  her
    mistake under the Rules.  The decision maker would not have  been  able
    to anticipate that a further document was to be produced.  There was no
    error or omission in the documents submitted.  On those  documents  the
    funds had gone below the required limit.  The correct course  would  be
    to make a fresh application.

9.   At the conclusion of the submissions I reserved my  decision.  However,
    it turned out that on the day of the  hearing  the  Supreme  Court  had
    given its judgment in Mandalia v Secretary of State [2015] UKSC  59.  I
    issued the following directions:

         "1.  On the day of the hearing the Supreme Court gave its  judgment
         in the case of Mandalia  v  Secretary  of  State  [2015]  UKSC  59.
         Understandably neither party was in a position to make  submissions
         in relation to that case. However, in the interests of fairness  it
         is right that they should have the  opportunity  to  do  so  as  it
         raises matters of potential relevance to this appeal. In particular
         the Supreme Court overruled the decision of Gu v Secretary of State
         [2014] EWHC 1634 (Admin) which the Secretary of State relied on  in
         her grounds of appeal.

         2.   The parties have 14 days from the date this notice is sent out
         to make submissions  about  the  effect  if  any  of  the  case  of
         Mandalia.

         After that time I will consider the disposal of the matter  further
         in the light of any submissions received."

10.  The appellant replied on 16  November  2015  relying  on  Mandalia  and
    submitted that her circumstances were indistinguishable.  Unfortunately
    there appears to  have  been  no  reply  to  the  directions  from  the
    respondent.

11.  It may well be the case that the respondent  accepts  that  her  appeal
    cannot be maintained in the light of the decision of the Supreme Court.

12.  The  appeal  raises  a  very  simple  issue.   The  appellant  had  the
    requisite funds in her account but mistakenly put in  documents  before
    the respondent which did not show that she complied with  the  relevant
    requirements of the Rules.  With her  appeal  she  submitted  the  bank
    statement, as the judge records, showing that she did comply  with  the
    Rules as at the date of the application.  In this  case  the  appellant
    relies on 245AA(b)(i) which reads as follows:

         "Some of the  documents  in  a  sequence  have  been  omitted  (for
         example, if one bank statement from a series is missing) ..."

    She refers to the letter from the Home Office acknowledging receipt  of
    her application where it was said that "if there is  any  problem  with
    the validity of the  application,  such  as  missing  documentation  or
    omissions on the form, a caseworker  will  write  to  you  as  soon  as
    possible to advise you what action you need  to  take  to  rectify  the
    problem."

13.   The  respondent  has  apparently  chosen  not  to  make  any   further
    submissions in compliance with the directions I issued.  The  applicant
    submits her circumstances are the same  in  all  material  respects  to
    those considered in Mandalia. In the apparent absence of any attempt by
    the respondent to respond to the directions I cannot find that there is
    any material error of law on the part of the  First-tier  Judge  and  I
    dismiss the respondent's appeal and accordingly  the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Judge shall stand.
