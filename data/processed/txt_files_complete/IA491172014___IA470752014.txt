For the Appellants:    Mr T Onokwu (solicitor)
For the Respondent:    Mrs R Pettersen (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellants before the Upper Tribunal are Mr Olivio Assuncao and Mrs
    Taiwo Oriyomi Shokunbi.  He is a national of Portugal who was  born  on
    7th August 1976.  She is a national of Nigeria who  was  born  on  10th
    August 1985.  The two are married to each other.  They have appealed to
    the Upper Tribunal, with permission, against a decision of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal (Judge Cox) promulgated on  16th  April  2015  dismissing
    their appeals.  The first Appellant's appeal to the First-tier Tribunal
    had been directed against a decision of 21st November  2014  to  remove
    him from the UK pursuant to Section 10 of the  Immigration  and  Asylum
    Act  1999  with  reference  to  Regulations  19,  21B  and  24  of  the
    Immigration (European Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006.   The  second
    Appellant's appeal to the First-tier Tribunal had been directed against
    a decision of 21st November 2014 refusing to grant her a residence card
    as confirmation of a right  of  residence  as  the  spouse  of  an  EEA
    national (the first Appellant).  Judge Cox decided  that  the  marriage
    between the two Appellants was a marriage  of  convenience  within  the
    meaning of the 2006 Regulations.  Accordingly,  it  followed  that  the
    second Appellant should be refused a residence card on the basis of the
    marriage.  He also upheld the Respondent's decision,  with  respect  to
    removal of the first Appellant on the  basis  of  abuse  of  rights  or
    fraud.

 2. The two Appellants have been interviewed by the Respondent and, at  the
    hearing before the First-tier Tribunal, challenges  were  made  on  the
    basis of their alleged treatment during the interview, the accuracy  of
    the interview record and the interpretation of  the  answers.   It  was
    also contended, with respect to the first Appellant, that  his  removal
    was not proportionate.

 3. The judge dealt with those matters in this way;

         "26. The Appellants submit that significant problems  arose  during
         the interview and as such the  interview  records  are  unreliable.
         The Appellant's solicitor drew my intention to  the  EU  Commission
         working document on addressing the issues of alleged  marriages  of
         convenience between EU citizens and non EU nationals.   There  are
         'tips for a good interview', which include:

                . it should be made  explicitly  clear  to  the  interviewed
                  spouses that the questions are given  to  dispel  concerns
                  the national authorities have as to whether  the  marriage
                  is genuine or not;

                . The interviewed spouses should be warned about  the  legal
                  consequences of their failure to be truthful and about the
                  sanctions national law imposes on persons abusing  EU  law
                  and free movement of EU citizens;

                . Any contradictions, inconsistencies, lack  of  details  in
                  implausible statements which are relevant for the decision
                  making should be identified  and  explicitly  put  to  the
                  interviewed spouses;

                .  it  is  important  to  avoid  as  far  as  possible   any
                  communication or comprehension problems.   A  printout  of
                  the interview record should be given and  the  interviewed
                  spouses should be given an opportunity  to  amend  or  add
                  anything they wish in a follow up.

         27.  I have taken the above tips into account  and  note  that  the
         Appellants knew why they were being interviewed and had been warned
         about the possible sanctions if the UK authorities considered  they
         were abusing EU law.  Following the interview, the EEA Sponsor  was
         given an opportunity to comment on the  officer's  suspicions  (see
         the enforcement note).

         28.  The Appellants state that they were treated harshly during the
         interview (see paragraph 6 of the Appellant's  witness  statement)
         and that they were largely misrepresented by the interview  record.
         In particular, the Appellant states that the EEA Sponsor  does  not
         speak very much English and that this caused  significant  problems
         during the interview.  She also stated  that  English  is  not  her
         first language and the interviewing officer made no attempt to  use
         an appropriate level of English.  There was confusion as to whether
         they were being asked for information  relating  to  themselves  or
         their spouse and on occasions they were being compelled to give  an
         answer.

         29.  I have carefully considered the interview  records  and  agree
         that the EEA Sponsor clearly did not understand question 18 of the
         interview and there was possibly further confusion at  questions 3
         and 6 of the interview records.  As  such,  I  have  given  anxious
         scrutiny to the remainder of the interview record.

         30.   On  the  other  hand,  there  are  a  significant  number  of
         differences between the Appellant and  the  EEA  Sponsor's  answers
         during the interview record.  In particular:

                . The Appellant stated that the lawyer helped them sign  the
                  application form whilst the EEA Sponsor  stated  that  the
                  Appellant signed the form (Q1);

                .  The   Appellant   stated   that   they   first   met   in
                  October/December 2013 whilst the EEA Sponsor stated it was
                  in 2011 (Q19);

                . The Appellant stated that they first met in a pub/club  in
                  Beckham (should be Peckham), whilst the EEA  Sponsor  said
                  that they met at a Costa Caf� in Peckham (Q20);

                . The Appellant stated that the EEA Sponsor was with two  of
                  his friends whilst he said he was by himself (Q22);

                . The  Appellant  stated  that  she  was  with  her  friend,
                  Baby Davis, whilst the EEA Sponsor said she was on her own
                  (Q23);

                . The Appellant stated that she was with him all night, that
                  they stayed at the club until the morning, whilst the  EEA
                  Sponsor stated that they spent 3 hours together 'we stayed
                  in the caf� shop for 3 hours.  After there we went to walk
                  around London and after an hour  we  stopped  walking  and
                  left' (Q24);

                . They were asked what time of day did  they  meet  and  the
                  Appellant replied night time to  early  in  the  morning,
                  whilst the EEA Sponsor said in the afternoon (Q26).

                . The Appellant stated that the EEA Sponsor  asked  for  her
                  phone number whilst they were in the nightclub and the EEA
                  Sponsor said he had asked for her number while  they  were
                  still in the coffee shop (Q27);

                . The Appellant stated that they went on  their  first  date
                  about 1 or 2 months later, whilst the EEA Sponsor said  it
                  was about a week later (Q28);

                . The Appellant stated that they went to  his  house  whilst
                  the EEA Sponsor said they went to a restaurant in Peckham,
                  but he did not remember the name (Q30);

                . The Appellant stated that the EEA Sponsor got there  first
                  whilst the EEA Sponsor said  that   she  got  there  first
                  (Q33);

                . The Appellant stated that they stayed at  home  and  spent
                  time together, whilst the EEA  Sponsor  said  they  looked
                  around the shops and after that they went and had  a  meal
                  (Q34);

                . The Appellant stated that  the  engagement  ring  is  gold
                  colour and has white stones  going  all  around  the  ring
                  whilst the EEA Sponsor said that it is dark red  and  that
                  there is one stone and that the ring is silver (Q43);

                .  The  Appellant  stated   that   they   got   married   on
                  7 August 2014 whilst  the  EEA  Sponsor  stated  it  was
                  11 October 2014;

                . The Appellant stated that one of the EEA Sponsor's friends
                  took them to their wedding in his car and that there  were
                  two of the EEA Sponsor's friends with  them.   Whilst  the
                  EEA Sponsor stated that they got a taxi and were with  his
                  friend  Victor and her friend Noni (Q53);

                . The Appellant stated that the EEA Sponsor's friend  Victor
                  was one of the witnesses but she could  not  remember  the
                  name of the EEA Sponsor's other  friend,  whilst  the  EEA
                  Sponsor stated that Victor and Noni were present (Q55);

                . The Appellant stated that they started living together  in
                  January/February 2014, whereas the EEA Sponsor  stated  it
                  was in July 2013 (Q58);

                . The Appellant stated that they started living together  at
                  [                ] whilst the EEA Sponsor stated  that  it
                  was a flat at [                              ] (Q59);

                . The Appellant stated that  the  EEA  Sponsor  last  worked
                  yesterday from 7.30am and he finished at 3pm,  whilst  the
                  EEA Sponsor said it was yesterday and he worked from 11.30
                  am to 8pm (Q66);

         31.   Over  and  above  their  general  concerns,  the   Appellants
         specifically addressed some of the differences.  In particular

                . (Q19) - the Appellant states that she thinks the  question
                  was framed differently as the EEA Sponsor  appears  to  be
                  answering the question  when  she  first  entered  the  UK
                  (paragraph 11 of her witness statement).  However, I note
                  that the EEA Sponsor did not give an explanation  for  his
                  answer in his witness statement;

                . (Qs 22 & 23), the EEA Sponsor stated  that  he  was  alone
                  with her but  he  had  gone  out  with  some  friends  and
                  therefore was not surprised that the  Appellant  had  said
                  that some of his friends were present.   However,  neither
                  of them explained why the EEA Sponsor had  said  that  the
                  Appellant was alone;

                . (Qs 30-31), the Appellant stated that she had explained to
                  the interviewing officer that the EEA Sponsor came to  her
                  house in London around noon and that later on she went  to
                  Oxford where he lives.

                . (the questions on  their  first  date),  the  EEA  Sponsor
                  stated that he  had  initially  said  that  he  could  not
                  remember where they had gone for their first date and that
                  he felt the interviewing officer was forcing him  to  give
                  an answer, as such he just said something  to  finish  the
                  interview (paragraph 8 of the witness statement).

                . (Qs 32-34), the EEA Sponsor stated that all that he  could
                  remember was that they met each  other  several  times  at
                  several different locations and the answers were based  on
                  those several meetings  as  it  was  not  clear  what  the
                  interviewing officer wanted (paragraph 9  of  his  witness
                  statement)

                . (Q43) the Appellant  states  that  she  believes  the  EEA
                  Sponsor had got confused about which  ring  he  was  being
                  asked about as she has two rings.  However I note that she
                  has not described  her  wedding  ring  and  there  are  no
                  photographs of her engagement ring or  her  wedding  ring;
                  and

                . (Qs 48, 58 and 59), the  Sponsor  explained  that  he  was
                  being told to say something even though it  was  difficult
                  to remember 'every address and date whilst on the spot'.

    32.  I appreciate that it can be difficult to  recall  exact  dates  or
    locations, especially when 'put on the spot'.  I also accept  that  the
    EEA Sponsor may have  been  confused,  when  answering  a  few  of  the
    questions and that the Appellants responses Qs 23 and 24 appear to have
    been transcribed the wrong way round.

    33.  Nevertheless, on the totality of the evidence I am satisfied  that
    I  can  attach  weight  to  the  interview  record.   In  my  view  the
    substantial differences cannot simply be explained away because English
    is not their first language.  Moreover, I am  not  satisfied  that  the
    Appellant  and  the  EEA  Sponsor   have   adequately   addressed   the
    Respondent's concerns.

    34.  In any event, having had the opportunity to hear the EEA Sponsor I
    am satisfied that the  Appellants  have  not  provided  any  cogent  or
    credible evidence  to  rebut  the  substantive  issues  raised  by  the
    Respondent.  The EEA Sponsor was an unimpressive witness.  I appreciate
    that the EEA Sponsor's spoken English is limited and  have  taken  this
    into  account,  when  assessing  his  evidence.   Nevertheless,  I   am
    satisfied that he has a have a very good understanding of English and I
    have concluded that his evidence is wholly unreliable.

    35.  At the outset of his  evidence,  the  EEA  Sponsor  was  asked  to
    confirm his name and address and he told me [                        ].
     At the end of cross examination the Presenting Officer  put  to  the
    Appellant that the mother of his children stated that she was living at
    [                       ] (see her letter dated 25 March 2015).   The
    EEA Sponsor then stated that that isn't his address.  He said  he  just
    uses it as a correspondence address and that at present  he  is  moving
    around and staying with different friends.  If the EEA  Sponsor  cannot
    give me a straight answer, when asked for his address, then  this  begs
    the question as to what I can rely on.  Especially as other aspects  of
    his oral evidence gave rise to further concerns.

    36.  For example, the EEA Sponsor told me that he phones the  Appellant
    nearly every day and they would  speak  for  about  20 - 40  minutes.
    However, when I asked for some basic information about  the  Appellant,
    the EEA Sponsor's answers were vague and lacked detail.  In particular,
    he told me that she was staying with friends, but he did not know their
    names or where they lived.  In addition, he was unable to tell  me  how
    she spent her time, other than to say she went to the shops.

    37.  I have also considered the  Immigration  Enforcement  note,  which
    includes Immigration Officer Short's record of an  interview  with  the
    EEA Sponsor after the Appellant  was  detained.   The  EEA  Sponsor  is
    recorded as saying that he had made a mistake  and  that  he  had  been
    trying to help the Appellant but now  releases  that  helping  her  was
    wrong.  He also is alleged to have said that she was going to give  him
    money for working here.  Officer Short recorded the conversation in his
    notebook and offered the  EEA  Sponsor  the  opportunity  to  read  the
    record.  However the EEA Sponsor indicated that he was  happy  to  sign
    the notebook agreeing the  record  as  a  true  and  accurate  account.
    During cross examination  the  EEA  Sponsor  denied  making  any  such
    statements and effectively stated that the officer had made it up.

    38.  However the EEA Sponsor has not asked for a copy of  the  notebook
    to be  produced  and  although  the  Appellant's  solicitor's  skeleton
    argument suggests that IO Short should have attended the  hearing,  no
    formal application for IO Short's attendance has been made.

    39.  In addition, the Appellant did not attend and I have not  had  the
    opportunity to hear her oral evidence.  In my view, as she has not been
    cross examined, her witness statement is of little assistance.

    40   On the totality of the evidence the Respondent  has  satisfied  me
    that  this  is  a  marriage  of  convenience.   The  interview   record
    highlighted substantial differences on material facts and the Appellant
    has failed to provide any cogent or credible evidence in rebuttal.

    41.  Accordingly, I am satisfied that the decision to refuse  to  issue
    the Appellant a residence card was in accordance with the law.

    42.  In relation to the EEA Sponsor, I now have to consider whether  or
    not the decision to remove him as a result of the abusive fraud he  has
    conducted is proportionate.

    43.  The Appellant's solicitor submitted that I need  to  consider  the
    factors listed in regulation 21(6) of the regulations.  I note that the
    regulations require these factors to  be  taken  into  account  when  a
    decision has been  taken  on  the  grounds  of  public  policy,  public
    security or public health, which is not the situation  in  the  present
    case.  Nevertheless it  seems  to  me  that  they  are  relevant,  when
    determining whether the Respondent's decision is proportionate.

    44.  The EEA Sponsor asserts that he  has  been  in  the  UK  for  over
    14 years and that he has 2 children, who were born here and with whom
    he has a parental relationship.  However, there is a lack  of  evidence
    to support his claims.

    45.  In fact, there is a lack of  evidence  as  to  the  EEA  Sponsor's
    circumstances in the UK generally.  He provided some  evidence  of  his
    employment that dates back to March 2014 (see payslips at pages 71 to
    74 of the Appellant's bundle, but there is a lack of  evidence  of  any
    employment in the UK prior to that date.

    46.  In addition, there is a birth certificate for A born in 2010  that
    lists the EEA Sponsor as his father and a letter  from  a  school  that
    confirms that A is attending a school in the UK (pages 6 and 7 of the
    EEA  Sponsor's  bundle).   He  has  also  provided  a  letter  that  is
    purportedly written by the mother of the children.  However, this could
    have been written by anyone and in  light  of  my  general  credibility
    findings, I attach little weight to the letter.

    47.  Although the EEA Sponsor may be a father of a  child  in  the  UK,
    there  is  a  lack  of  credible  evidence  showing  that  he  has  any
    involvement  with  the   child's   upbringing,   let   alone   evidence
    establishing that he has a parental relationship with them.

    48.  On  the  totality  of  the  evidence,  I  am  satisfied  that  the
    Respondent was entitled to apply regulations 19(3)(c) and 24(2) of the
    EEA regulations and that the Respondent's decision to  remove  the  EEA
    Sponsor by way of directions under section 10  of  the  Immigration  &
    Asylum Act 1999 does not breach Community law and  was  in  accordance
    with the law."

 4. The two Appellants, albeit that by this time the second  Appellant  had
    returned or been returned to Nigeria, applied for permission to  appeal
    to the Upper Tribunal.  The grounds relied upon were to the effect that
    the judge had, with respect to the first Appellant, failed to  consider
    the question of proportionality and, with respect to  both  Appellants,
    had failed to properly consider the marriage of convenience  issue,  in
    particular, in relation to what had been said in interview.  Permission
    to appeal was originally refused by a Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal
    but granted by a Judge of the Upper Tribunal who said this;

         "1.  For the avoidance of doubt I make it clear that  I  give  both
             Appellants permission to appeal on all grounds.

         2.   However my main concern is that I find it reasonably  arguable
             that the First-tier Tribunal did not show  proper  regard  for
             the need for the removal decision against the first  Appellant
             to be proportionate".

 5. There followed a hearing before me at which I heard submissions  as  to
    whether or not the decision of the First-tier Tribunal ought to be  set
    aside for legal error.  I took full account of those  submissions  and,
    having heard them, indicated to the parties that I  was  satisfied  the
    determination did not contain legal error.   I  set  out  my  reasoning
    below.

 6. The determination is, on any  view,  most  careful  and  thorough.   Mr
    Onokwu in his Grounds  of  Appeal  and  in  his  oral  submissions  was
    critical of the way in which Judge Cox had dealt with the  marriage  of
    convenience issue and the interview record and made reference  to  "the
    Commission Staff Working Document" which he  said  indicated  that  the
    possibility of misunderstanding  of  questions,  innocently  inaccurate
    recollection of events, limited knowledge,  limited  understanding  and
    personal perspective regarding relative events had  to  be  taken  into
    account when  looking  at  evidence  regarding  a  marriage.   He  also
    contended that, as to the first Appellant, the decision to  remove  him
    had been disproportionate bearing in mind a number of factors  such  as
    his claimed period of long residence in the  UK,  his  having  children
    (from a previous  relationship)  settled  in  the  UK  and  his  having
    acquired a right of residence under the 2006 Regulations.  He  referred
    to what he described as "Article 28(1) of the European  Directive"  and
    said that a  number  of  specific  factors  had  to  be  considered  in
    assessing proportionality, the implication being, that  Judge  Cox  had
    not conducted such an exercise.

 7. The judge was clearly  very  aware  of  the  concerns  which  had  been
    expressed regarding the conducting of the interview.  At  paragraph  26
    he noted the concerns expressed and made reference to an EUC Commission
    Working  Document  on  addressing  issues  of  alleged   marriages   of
    convenience.  He took into account what was said, therein, as to how an
    effective interview could be conducted.  He related that to the way  in
    which the two Appellants' interviews had been conducted  at  paragraphs
    27 and 28.  He accepted, in part, that there had been a difficulty with
    respect to the understanding of a particular question on  the  part  of
    the first Appellant and  some  confusion  with  respect  to  two  other
    questions and indicated, quite properly, that  in  consequence  he  had
    given anxious scrutiny to the remainder of the  interview  record.   He
    then analysed, in detail, what he found to be a significant  number  of
    differences in the answers given by the first Appellant and those given
    by  the  second  Appellant.   He  took  into  account   the   proffered
    explanations which the Appellants had advanced  (paragraph  31  of  the
    determination) and reminded himself of the potential for confusion in a
    formal interview situation (paragraph 32).  He then concluded  that  he
    was able to attach weight to the interview record.  In my  judgment  he
    was perfectly entitled to arrive at that view.   His  consideration  of
    the concerns raised by the two Appellants was full  and  fair.   I  can
    discern no error of law whatsoever in his approach.   Further,  and  in
    any event, he went on to explain why, independently  of  the  interview
    evidence, he had found the first Appellant, in particular, not to be  a
    credible witness and the reasons for his so concluding, from paragraphs
    34 to 38 of the determination were open to him and were adequate.

 8. In short, the judge was entitled to conclude that the marriage was  one
    of convenience for the careful and complete reasons he gave.

 9. I now turn to the question  of  proportionality.   To  some  extent  it
    seemed to me that Mr Onokwu was contending that the matter  had  simply
    not been considered by the judge.  To some extent  he  appeared  to  be
    seeking to reargue the facts of the case though I have treated what  he
    had to say, in this regard, as a contention that the  judge's  findings
    on the point were either incomplete, perverse or irrational.

10. What the judge had to say about all of this appears in a  passage  from
    paragraphs 42 to 48 of the determination.   Essentially,  what  he  was
    saying was that although the first Appellant had  made  various  claims
    regarding matters such as his family and other links to the  UK,  there
    was simply a  dearth  of  evidence  regarding  that.   Crucially,  with
    respect to the children, whilst he accepted that the Appellant might be
    the father of UK-based children he noted the lack of credible  evidence
    to suggest that he had any  involvement  with  the  upbringing  or  any
    potential relationship with them.

11. It seems to me that the judge was right to conclude that  there  was  a
    dearth of such evidence.  I have carefully  looked  at  the  bundle  of
    documents which had been provided for the First-tier  Tribunal  hearing
    and there is nothing  of  substance  regarding  the  first  Appellant's
    claimed  UK  links  contained  in  them  other  than  some  wage  slips
    demonstrating that he was employed in the UK in 2014.  It seems  to  me
    that against the background of  the  lack  of  tangible,  corroborative
    evidence together with a clear adverse credibility finding with respect
    to the first Appellant, the judge was perfectly entitled to conclude as
    he did, for the reasons he did, with respect to  proportionality.   Had
    he specifically gone through the checklist of factors which  Mr  Onokwu
    set out in his written Grounds  of  Appeal  he  would  have  inevitably
    reached the same decision on the same basis being the lack of  credible
    evidence.

12. In truth, it seems to me that the grounds and  submissions  represented
    an attempt to reargue matters properly  determined  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  I am grateful to Mr Onokwu for his assistance at the hearing
    and for his careful submissions but they do not  demonstrate  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal erred in law.

13. In light of all of the above, therefore, the decision of the First-tier
    Tribunal, with respect to each Appellant, shall stand.
