Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Staunton, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Bhebhe, Legal Representative, Njomane Immigration
                    Law Practice, Luton


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant in these proceedings is the Secretary of  State,  however
    for convenience I shall now refer to the parties as  they  were  before
    the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Zimbabwe born on 10th January 1993.   She
    appealed against the decision of the  Respondent  dated  18th  December
    2013 refusing to grant her entry clearance to the United Kingdom as the
    adult dependent relative of a person present and settled in the  United
    Kingdom under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.

 3. Her appeal was heard by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Somal on  17th
    October and 17th  November  2014.   The  appeal  was  allowed  and  the
    determination promulgated on 2nd December 2014.

 4. An application for permission to appeal was lodged and  permission  was
    granted by Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  Grant-Hutchison  on  22nd
    January 2015.  The grounds for permission are that the judge failed  to
    give reasons or adequate reasons why the Appellant's application  meets
    the requirements of the Immigration  Rules.   The  issue  is  long-term
    personal care and the fact that there has been a failure on the part of
    her family to put in place any  care  arrangements  in  Zimbabwe.   The
    grounds refer to the Appellant having family members  in  Zimbabwe  who
    could provide her with support.  They then go  on  to  state  that  the
    judge  misdirected  herself  in  coming  to  the  decision   that   the
    Appellant's appeal should be allowed outside the Immigration  Rules  as
    she erred in her approach to the Article 8  assessment  by  failing  to
    identify why the Appellant's circumstances can be defined as compelling
    or exceptional.  They also state that the judge gave  no  consideration
    to the Immigration Act 2014 or Part 5A of the Nationality,  Immigration
    & Asylum Act 2002.

 5. On 13th March 2015 the Appellant appeared before me and I  found  there
    to be material errors of law in the  judge's  decision.   My  decision,
    giving my reasons for this finding, was promulgated on 13th April 2015.
     I set aside the First-tier Tribunal's decision which  was  promulgated
    on 2nd December 2014 and directed a second stage hearing on all issues.



The Hearing

 6. The Appellant's mother [SM], the sponsor, took the  stand.   She  asked
    that the statement she had made for the First-tier hearing be  used  as
    evidence for this hearing.

 7. The Appellant's representative asked her what arrangements she had  put
    in place to help the Appellant up to today's date.   The  Sponsor  said
    she has a friend, from the church in Zimbabwe, who she phones and  asks
    to check on the Appellant but this friend has a life of her own  and  a
    big family to look after so she can only go occasionally  to  check  on
    the Appellant. She said this is not a suitable arrangement.   She  said
    the Appellant does not have much help in  Zimbabwe.   The  Sponsor  was
    asked what medical care and treatment the Appellant has in Zimbabwe and
    she said that medical care is available but not to the  level  required
    by the Appellant.  She said that the Appellant, because she has  no-one
    supervising her, spends her day sleeping in her  room.   She  does  not
    cook or bathe or communicate with anyone and  does  not  eat  properly.
    The Sponsor said the Appellant requires care on a daily basis as she is
    unable to look after herself.

 8. The representative asked the Sponsor what family the Appellant  has  in
    Zimbabwe. She said her grandparents are there but they are elderly  and
    they live in a remote area.  She said there are no  hospitals  in  that
    area and no electricity in the houses and the  water  supply  is  poor.
    She  said  they  live  a  long  way  from  the  Appellant,  around  500
    kilometres.  The Sponsor was asked why she cannot go and stay with  her
    grandparents and she said because there are no  hospitals  there.   She
    said that her grandparents are old and would be unable  to  look  after
    the Appellant in her present condition.   She said  they  do  not  have
    much money.  She said they will not  move  away  from  the  rural  area
    because  of  their  age.   The  representative  asked   her,   if   her
    grandparents lived  near  her,  would  it  make  a  difference  to  the
    Appellant, but the Sponsor said she does not think so.  She said if the
    Appellant was healthy she would have to look  after  her  grandparents,
    not the other way round.

 9. I asked if there are any medical reports on the  grandparents.   I  was
    told that there are not.

10. The Sponsor went on  to  say  that  the  Appellant  has  mental  health
    problems.  She is depressed and anxious and  needs  professional  care.
    She was asked what relatives there are in  Zimbabwe  on  her  husband's
    side and she said her husband had a brother but he died in May 2014.

11. The representative asked the Sponsor what financial support she and her
    husband provide and she said they send about �150 a month and sometimes
    more if it is needed, because the cost of living is going up.  She said
    it is probably nearer �250 a month now.  She said  that  amount  covers
    rent and food, electricity and water and fees for the  doctor  and  for
    counselling.  She said the Appellant  stays  in  shared  accommodation.
    The Appellant's representative asked her how she sends  the  money  and
    she said through Western Union and the Appellant gets the money because
    a church member or a friend goes with her to collect it and  helps  her
    with shopping.  She was asked why she cannot go back and look after her
    daughter.  She said her daughter, the Appellant, is very  important  to
    her and to her husband and that she and  her  husband  have  a  genuine
    marriage.  She said they have a 2 year old daughter now and  the  whole
    family is British apart from the Appellant.  She said their life is  in
    the United Kingdom. They are settled here and they work  here  and  pay
    tax and she said they have been living here for a long time.  She  said
    that for  her  to  go  back  to  look  after  the  Appellant  would  be
    unreasonable and would lead to the breakdown of her  marriage  and  her
    family life.  She said it would be better if the Appellant was  in  the
    United Kingdom.  She could look after her properly here.  She  said  it
    is unfair if the Appellant  is  not  allowed  to  come  to  the  United
    Kingdom.

12. I asked the Sponsor about her relatives and she said she has a  brother
    in New Zealand and two sisters in the United Kingdom.

13. The Presenting Officer cross-examined the Sponsor.  He asked  her  when
    she came to the United Kingdom and she said in December  2011  and  she
    was asked why she came.  She said she came to settle and  to  join  her
    husband here.  She was asked when she got married  and  she  said  15th
    October 2010 and she was asked  if  her  husband  had  been  living  in
    Zimbabwe or the United Kingdom when they married and she  said  in  the
    United Kingdom. The Presenting Officer asked the sponsor  how  she  met
    her husband and she said they met in Bulawayo in  December  2008.   She
    was asked if she was living with the Appellant before she came  to  the
    United Kingdom and she said she was and she was asked if  this  was  in
    the same accommodation the Appellant stays in now and she said  it  was
    not.  She said the Appellant lives in shared accommodation  with  other
    lodgers.  She was asked if these  other  lodgers  are  friends  of  the
    Appellant and she said the Appellant does not talk about them and  does
    not seem to have any friends.  She was asked how often  she  speaks  to
    the Appellant and she said they telephone each other  and  e-mail  each
    other. There are no regular times, it varies.

14. The Sponsor said the Appellant has health issues and she was asked what
    they are.  She said she has asthma and anxiety and depression and  also
    has suicidal ideation.  The Presenting Officer asked her what treatment
    the Appellant has for her asthma and she said she has  an  inhaler  and
    tablets that she pays for.  She said she has therapy sessions  for  her
    anxiety and depression two times  a  month.   She  said  she  also  has
    tablets for that and she, the sponsor, pays for  them.   She  said  the
    Appellant has to take the tablets every day.   The  Presenting  Officer
    asked the Sponsor how often her friend in the church looks  in  on  the
    Appellant and she said once or twice a  month  or  if  she  phones  her
    friend and asks her to look in.

15. The Presenting Officer  asked  the  sponsor  if  she  has  visited  the
    Appellant and she said she visited  in  August  2015  and  her  husband
    visited in 2014.  She was asked why she did not visit in 2014  and  she
    said she had been recovering from having a baby and had been  unfit  to
    travel.  The Presenting Officer asked her  if  she  had  not  seen  the
    Appellant between 2011 and 2014 and she said that is  correct  and  she
    was asked how the Appellant was when she left in 2011 and she said  she
    was 18 years old, was well, fit and healthy.  She  said  she  had  been
    studying and she finished studying in December 2011.  She said she  has
    not worked since then.

16. The Sponsor was asked when the Appellant got  depressed  and  she  said
    that when she moved out of her friend's house in October 2012 she began
    to get depressed.  She said her friend's family had to downsize and  no
    longer had room for the Appellant.

17. A second witness took the stand being the Sponsor's husband, [PM].   He
    is the stepfather of the Appellant and lives at the same address as the
    Sponsor.  He asked that his statement  be  used  as  evidence  for  the
    hearing.  He was asked  how  the  Appellant  is  and  he  said  she  is
    depressed and suicidal.  He said she goes to therapy but she  lives  on
    her own and her mental state is poor.  He said she has asthma  and  has
    no ambition and does not care about life.  He was asked what family  he
    has in Zimbabwe and he said he has no-one.  He said a brother died  and
    a brother is in South Africa and his parents are dead.  He said he  has
    other siblings in the United Kingdom and America.

18. There are some medical notes in the Appellant's bundle and I  asked  if
    there is an up-to-date medical report on the  Appellant  but  there  is
    not.

19. The Presenting Officer cross-examined this witness.  He asked him about
    the Appellant's suicidal ideation.  He said she tried to  kill  herself
    in 2014.  He said he visited her in May 2014 and  her  suicide  attempt
    was in March 2014.   He  asked  the  witness  if  there  has  been  any
    improvement in the Appellant's health since May but he said  there  has
    been no change, but no further suicide attempts.

20. The witness was asked by the Presenting Officer how often her  mother's
    friend from the church visits her and he said about twice  a  month  or
    more if they ask her to visit.  He said the Appellant  is  supposed  to
    take medication every day.  He was asked if there is anyone  to  remind
    her to do this and he said there is not and very  often  she  does  not
    take it.  He said he and the Sponsor get in touch with her telling  her
    to take her medication and they have told her roommates  to  make  sure
    she takes her medication but she still sometimes forgets.  He was asked
    if the Appellant talks about her roommates and he said not really.   He
    said she hardly communicates with him and his wife.

21. The Presenting Officer asked the witness if he works and he said he  is
    an accountant and his wife is a support worker.

22. The Presenting Officer  made  his  submissions  relying  on  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer's decision of 18th December 2013.  He referred to the
    Respondent's bundle Annex B.  He referred to E22 of that bundle being a
    letter from the Appellant's  representatives  to  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer.  At paragraph 3 of this letter it states  that  the  Appellant
    lives alone in exceptionally compassionate circumstances  in  Zimbabwe.
    He referred to the case of R v Immigration Appeal Tribunal ex parte Gui
    Mario Joseph dated 15th February 1988.  He submitted that he is relying
    on  this  case  which  states  that  the   phrase   "most   exceptional
    compassionate circumstances" must exclude almost every imaginable case.
     He submitted that this  Appellant's  condition  and  circumstances  in
    Zimbabwe do not overcome that hurdle.

23. He submitted that the facts are that her  mother  came  to  the  United
    Kingdom and her mother can visit her in Zimbabwe  and  can  communicate
    with her in Zimbabwe.  He submitted that there is no  reason  why  this
    cannot continue.  He submitted that her mother could go back to stay in
    Zimbabwe.

24. I was referred to E32 in the Appellant's bundle being a  report  by  Dr
    Njau of Lobengula Medical Clinic in Zimbabwe.  This report states  that
    the Appellant's illness started soon after  her  mother  left  for  the
    United Kingdom.  He submitted that the report does not suggest that the
    Appellant comes to the United Kingdom to live  with  her  mother.   The
    report makes it clear that  the  Appellant  has  been  prescribed  with
    medication in Zimbabwe and can be treated there and  is  being  treated
    there.  He submitted that there is nothing to suggest that she would be
    getting different medical treatment if she was in the  United  Kingdom.
    He submitted that a friend of her mother from  the  church  visits  her
    twice a month and sometimes more, but she does not get daily care.

25. I was asked to consider the Appellant's private life and assess  public
    interest against the Appellant's human rights.  I was referred  to  the
    case of EV (Philippines) & Others [2014] EWCA Civ 874.  This states  at
    paragraph 60 that the United Kingdom cannot provide  medical  treatment
    for the world.  He submitted that if the Appellant comes to the  United
    Kingdom she will receive  the  same  treatment  here  as  she  does  in
    Zimbabwe.  He submitted that because her mother is here does  not  give
    her an automatic right to come to the United  Kingdom.   The  situation
    has arisen because of the choice of her mother and stepfather, as  they
    want to stay in the United Kingdom and not in Zimbabwe.

26. I was asked to dismiss the appeal.

27. The Appellant's representative made  his  submissions  relying  on  his
    skeleton argument.  He submitted that Appendix FM  of  the  Immigration
    Rules and E-ECDR.2.4. and 2.5 must be satisfied.  I was referred  first
    of all to E-ECDR.2.4. which states that the Appellant must, as a result
    of age, illness or  disability,  require  long-term  personal  care  to
    perform everyday tasks.  He submitted that clearly her  age  is  not  a
    relevant factor, but she is ill and is disabled because of her  medical
    condition.  She is unable to function because of her mental illness and
    he submitted that she requires long-term personal care to carry on with
    her life normally and to perform everyday tasks.  I was asked  to  find
    that the medical evidence supports this.

28. I was referred to the  case  of  Osman  (Somalia)  which  is  on  file,
    OA/18244/2012.  He submitted that this  is  a  similar  Upper  Tribunal
    case.  He submitted that without the help of the Sponsor this Appellant
    is unable to get the required  level  of  care.   There  is  no-one  in
    Zimbabwe who can provide  this  care  to  the  required  standard.   He
    submitted that we do not know how  long  the  Appellant's  illness  may
    last.  He submitted that the evidence makes it clear that she is unable
    to do normal everyday tasks and is unable to look after herself, so she
    does not have  a  reasonable  life  in  Zimbabwe.   He  submitted  that
    professional care is not what is required, it is personal care that  is
    required.

29. With regard to the Appellant's grandparents he submitted that they  are
    in their 80s and  are  frail  and  are  unable  to  take  care  of  the
    Appellant. In any case they live 500 kilometres away from her.

30. He submitted that when the case was heard by the  First  Tier  Tribunal
    the judge found that the terms of the Rules had  been  satisfied.   The
    problem with that determination was that the First Tier Judge  did  not
    link the Rules with the evidence.  He submitted that  there  is  robust
    evidence to support  the  Appellant's  claim  and  based  on  the  oral
    evidence today there is no-one in Zimbabwe, either on her mother's side
    or her stepfather's side who can properly look after the Appellant.

31. He submitted that her mother should not require to return  to  Zimbabwe
    to look after the Appellant.  This is not  necessary  and  would  be  a
    disproportionate interference with her mother's family life.

32. He submitted that the terms of the Rules have been satisfied.

33. With regard to Article 8 and the  said  case  of  EV  (Philippines)  he
    submitted that the Sponsors in this case  are  British.   He  submitted
    that they will maintain and accommodate the Appellant and there will be
    no recourse to public funds.  The Appellant will not be a burden on the
    state.  The Appellant will be living with her mother and her stepfather
    and this is her family life.  He submitted that the fact  that  she  is
    over 18 years of age does not mean that she cannot have a  family  life
    with her mother.  There can be family life between adults.

34. The representative submitted that if I find that Article 8 in terms  of
    the Rules cannot be satisfied then Article 8 of ECHR outside the  Rules
    applies and a claim under Article 8 outside the Rules must succeed.  He
    submitted that it would be disproportionate to  exclude  the  Appellant
    from the United Kingdom.

35. With regard to Section 117B he submitted that he has addressed this  in
    his skeleton argument.

36. He asked me to allow the appeal under  the  Immigration  Rules  and  on
    human rights grounds.

Decision and Reasons

37. The burden of proof is on the Appellant and the standard  of  proof  is
    the balance of probabilities.

38. I have considered all of the evidence on file, the oral evidence  given
    at the hearing and  the  submissions  of  both  parties,  the  skeleton
    argument of the Appellant's representative.

39. This Appellant has applied for entry clearance as  an  adult  dependent
    relative under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.  For the Appellant
    to be successful in this claim, because she is over 18  years  of  age,
    she  has  to  show  that  she  is  living  in  the   most   exceptional
    compassionate circumstances in  Zimbabwe.   First  of  all  I  have  to
    consider compassionate circumstances and secondly I  have  to  consider
    whether there are any aggravating features to make them exceptional.

40. The Appellant is staying in shared  accommodation.   When  the  Sponsor
    left Zimbabwe the Appellant was fit, well and happy.  The Appellant  is
    educated but is unable to work because she is not well.  Her mother  in
    the United Kingdom supports her financially.  Her  mother  states  that
    she also keeps in touch with her by telephone and e-mail.

41. I have to consider the medical evidence.   The  Sponsor's  evidence  is
    that the Appellant has no relatives in Zimbabwe.  The Appellant  is  an
    adult.  The division of families is inevitable if some  of  the  family
    members are over the age of 18.

42. There is a medical report from Dr  Njau  dated  5th  July  2013.   This
    states that the Appellant is depressed, withdrawn  and  indifferent  to
    her environment. She has been prescribed with anti-depressants and goes
    to psychotherapy.  The Appellant told the doctor she  tried  to  commit
    suicide.  It is clear that the Appellant is getting  medical  treatment
    in Zimbabwe. There is no evidence that  if  she  comes  to  the  United
    Kingdom her medical treatment will be different to that  which  she  is
    receiving in Zimbabwe. The doctor's letter  does  not  state  that  the
    Appellant's health would improve if she came to the United  Kingdom  to
    stay with her mother and  stepfather.  The  Appellant's  representative
    argues that personal care is different from medical or nursing care and
    his argument is that the Appellant requires  long-term  personal  care,
    but that is not what the medical evidence  indicates  and  the  medical
    evidence is not up-to-date. I find that the Sponsor and her husband are
    exaggerating the Appellant's condition.

43. The Appellant's mother and stepfather state that the required level  of
    care is not available in Zimbabwe.   There  is  no-one  there  who  can
    reasonably provide it.  The evidence has not established that  that  is
    the case.  The doctor has suggested that  a  family  member  should  be
    available to care for the Appellant.  In 2011  the  Appellant's  mother
    left Zimbabwe, leaving the Appellant on her  own.   At  that  time  the
    Appellant was an adult.  Her mother's evidence is that she contacts the
    Appellant by telephone and Skype, but she is not prepared to return  to
    Zimbabwe to care for her.  This in itself makes  me  believe  that  the
    Appellant's mother is exaggerating the present  situation.   I  do  not
    find that it has been established that the required level  of  care  in
    the country where the Appellant is living cannot be obtained  with  the
    financial help of the Sponsor. For this appeal  to  succeed  under  the
    Rules not only does the Appellant have to be  living  in  compassionate
    circumstances  they  have  to   be   very   exceptional   compassionate
    circumstances.  I believe that if that was  the  case  the  Appellant's
    mother would be  prepared  to  return  to  Zimbabwe  to  care  for  the
    Appellant. Her mother's move to the United Kingdom was one  of  choice,
    not necessity.  She has chosen her husband over her daughter.  She  is,
    however paying for medical treatment for her daughter and accommodation
    for her daughter and I find that the Appellant is therefore not  living
    in the most exceptional compassionate circumstances in Zimbabwe. I find
    that a nurse or other carer could be employed by the  Sponsor  to  care
    for the Appellant  if  she  feels  that  is  necessary.  The  evidence,
    however, apart from the  oral  evidence,  does  not  suggest  that  the
    Appellant needs daily care. With regard to her  attempted  suicide  the
    only evidence of this is hearsay and oral evidence.

44. The personal care, which I am told is required by the Appellant, has to
    be long-term personal care.  The medical evidence does not  state  that
    the Appellant's medical condition is long-term.  With the treatment she
    is receiving in Zimbabwe she may well start to recover and be  able  to
    look after herself.

45. I have to consider the situation of the  Appellant's  grandparents  who
    live in a rural area in Zimbabwe.  I have  no  medical  evidence  about
    their state of health.  I am told they are elderly but there is nothing
    to support the oral evidence about them.  Perhaps the  Appellant  could
    stay with them or they could travel to the  Appellant  and  look  after
    her.

46. This Appellant's claim cannot succeed under the Immigration Rules.

47. I now have to consider Article 8.  Article 8 is now  contained  in  the
    Immigration Rules.  I do not find that the Appellant  has  family  life
    with her mother in the  United  Kingdom.   She  has  her  own  life  in
    Zimbabwe.  She is an adult and was an adult when  her  mother  left  in
    2011.  I accept that there can be family life between adults but  there
    is no evidence before me to show that  there  is  anything  unusual  or
    exceptional in the Appellant's relationship with her mother.

48. The public interest question is included in the Immigration Rules.

49. I have considered paragraph 276ADE of the Rules and it  is  clear  that
    its terms cannot be satisfied.  I have also considered Appendix FM  and
    paragraphs  E-ECDR  2.4  and  2.5  and  again  their  terms  cannot  be
    satisfied.

50. I am now considering Article 8 outside the Rules.  To do this I need to
    look at the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  and  the  new
    Part 5A therein which contains Sections 117A to D.  I have to carry out
    a proportionality exercise.  I have to weigh the  Appellant's  and  her
    mother's human rights  against  public  interest.   This  Appellant  is
    receiving medical treatment in Zimbabwe.  If she comes  to  the  United
    Kingdom she will probably receive the same medical  treatment  and  may
    well receive this on the NHS and this has to be taken into account when
    public interest is dealt with.  I have to consider the case  of  Razgar
    [2004] UKHL 27.  When the balancing exercise is carried out I  have  to
    look at the maintenance of effective immigration control.  I have  been
    told that no claims on public funds will be made but if the NHS is used
    then this is in effect, a claim on public funds.   The  Appellant  will
    not be financially independent.  She will be relying on her mother  and
    stepfather.  She is an adult and she was an adult when her mother  left
    her in Zimbabwe.  When proportionality is assessed public interest must
    succeed.

51. I find that this Appellant's family and private life is in Zimbabwe and
    her claim cannot succeed under Article 8 of ECHR.

Notice of Decision

52. I dismiss the Appellant's appeal under the Immigration Rules.

53. I dismiss the Appellant's appeal under Article 8 of ECHR.

54. Anonymity has been directed.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify her  or  any  member  of  her  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
