For the Appellant:      No legal representative
For the Respondent:     Mr A Mullen, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1) The appellant is a citizen of  Morocco,  born  on  21  March  1976.   The
   sponsor is his wife, Mrs Deborah Souihli, a UK citizen.  They married  in
   Morocco on 14 July 2008, and lived together there until October 2010 when
   the sponsor returned to the UK  for  medical  treatment.   The  appellant
   visited her in the UK in September 2011, January  2012  and  September  -
   October 2012, returning each time well within the period permitted by his
   visas.  On 25 November 2012, he applied  to  settle  in  the  UK  as  her
   spouse.

2) The Entry Clearance Officer refused the application by  notice  dated  10
   January 2013, under reference only to the financial requirements  of  the
   Immigration Rules.  She was required to have a gross  income  of  �18,600
   pa, but earned only �14,508 pa, and had insufficient savings.

3) The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  He did  not  seek  an
   oral hearing.  By determination promulgated on 21  June  2013  FtT  Judge
   Ferguson dismissed the appeal under the Immigration Rules and  under  the
   ECHR.

4) On 1 August 2013 Designated Judge Woodcraft granted permission to  appeal
   to the Upper Tribunal, on  the  view  that  the  judge's  conclusions  in
   respect of the Rules and Article 8 were both arguably wrong in the  light
   of MM & Others v SSHD [2013] EWHC 1900 (Admin).

5) Mr Mullen confirmed that the SSHD has been granted permission  to  appeal
   MM, and that a hearing is expected to take place in the Court  of  Appeal
   in March 2014.  He did not press for  an  adjournment.   He  acknowledged
   that while MM is not binding, it might be viewed  as  highly  persuasive,
   perhaps more so as at the time of giving the judgement the Hon Mr Justice
   Blake was also the President  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  (Immigration  and
   Asylum Chamber).  Mr Mullen submitted that in this  case  the  First-tier
   Tribunal reached a  conclusion  which  was  open  to  it  and  which  was
   consistent with the approach explained in MM, although that case was  not
   then available.

6) The  following  information  emerged  from  questions  I  put,  and  from
   questions put by the Presenting Officer.  Mrs Souihli  advised  that  her
   husband had not been in the UK  prior  to  the  three  visits  since  her
   return.  He stayed for about 3 weeks each time, returning to his job as a
   salesman in Agadir.  He had hoped to visit her again  recently,  but  his
   application was refused this time by the Entry  Clearance  Officer.   She
   had not seen a copy of the refusal  notice.   (Perhaps  the  refusal  was
   based on suspicions about intention, given that the appellant  since  his
   last visit  has  made  the  application  leading  to  these  proceedings.
   Nothing turns on this refusal.)  He speaks very good  English.   (I  note
   from the application form that he  lists  languages  he  speaks  well  as
   Berber, French, Arabic and English.)  Mrs Souihli  speaks  only  English.
   She can exchange a few words of greeting in Arabic and French, but little
   more.  She returned to the UK firstly for treatment for cervical  cancer.
   Her treatment has been successful, and she  is  now  subject  only  to  3
   yearly check-ups.  She has some fibroid problems for which she is on iron
   treatment.  She  works  full  time  as  an  auxiliary  nurse  at  Woodend
   Hospital, Aberdeen.  Her adult daughter lives with her, works  full  time
   and contributes to the household expenses.  She has the tenancy  of  a  2
   bedroom flat.  She  does  not  anticipate  being  able  to  increase  her
   earnings to �18,600 pa.  She accepts that there is no longer any  medical
   reason for her not to resume living with her husband in Agadir.  However,
   they would both prefer to make their life in the UK.  She lived with  her
   husband  in  a  densely  populated  part  of  Agadir,  and  felt   almost
   housebound.  She was frightened to go out on her own, and went  out  only
   with her husband.  If she had been able to live in a  more  touristic  or
   international area of the city she would have been happy to go  out,  but
   apartments there were too expensive.  She had no real prospect of finding
   work due to the language barrier, and in  any  event  work  is  in  short
   supply.  Her husband when visiting Aberdeen has no problem getting around
   on his own and communicates well with her family  and  everyone  else  he
   meets.  He is a hard worker who  would  take  any  employment  available,
   starting as a cleaner if necessary.  (I note that on his application form
   he says that he has good skills in electricity and air conditioning.   He
   would look for a job in that domain but would hope  to  set  up  business
   eventually as a  fruit  and  vegetable  importer  or  as  an  upholstered
   furniture manufacturer.)   Her  husband's  three  sisters,  two  of  them
   married, and both his parents live in Morocco.   He  has  no  nephews  or
   nieces.  Ms Souihli said that it had proved very easy for her husband  to
   adapt to life in Aberdeen, but very difficult for her to adapt to life in
   Agadir.  She and her husband had tried for a child, but with her  medical
   history and the passage of time, she felt that this was now unlikely.

7) In relation to the fresh decision which might be  substituted,  if  error
   of law were to be found, the Presenting Officer accepted that this was  a
   case which would almost certainly have succeeded before the amendments to
   the Immigration Rules made in June 2012.  He also accepted that there was
   nothing adverse in the appellant's immigration history.  He was unable to
   say that there was any more on the state's side  of  the  proportionality
   balance than the general public interest in enforcing the Rules  as  they
   stand, including the strict financial requirements.

8) I indicated that the appeal would be allowed.

9) I adopt the conclusion in MM at paragraph 142 that the amended  Rules  as
   to the financial requirements applying to  entry  clearance  applications
   for a spouse amount to a disproportionate interference with the rights of
   UK citizen sponsors to enjoy respect for family life, and that the  Rules
   do not represent by themselves  a  fair  balance  between  the  competing
   interests involved.  I also adopt the conclusion at  paragraphs  149  and
   153 that the terms of the Rules and policy together are not sufficient to
   render the decision making process as a whole compatible with  the  ECHR.
   The observation at paragraph 153(ix) is apposite to this case:

    I recognise that there may be some circumstances where  the  character,
    conduct or immigration history of the foreign spouse and  the  economic
    circumstances of the couple in the UK are so dire that [exclusion]  was
    the foreseeable consequence of the particular marriage, but in the vast
    bulk  of  ordinary  cases  where  the  relationship  is   genuine   and
    subsisting, and there is no adverse history of the spouse to  weigh  in
    the balance, the imposition of such a stark choice  is  precisely  what
    Sedley LJ described as indirectly sending the citizen  into  exile.   I
    agree that in the broad generality of ordinary cases,  the  abandonment
    of the citizen's right of residence in order to enjoy family life  with
    his or her spouse is an unacceptable choice  and  a  disproportionately
    high price to pay for choosing a  foreign  spouse  in  an  increasingly
    international world.


10) The figure of �13,400  pa  was  identified  by  the  Migration  Advisory
   Committee as the lowest maintenance threshold appropriate, close  to  the
   adult minimum wage for a 40 hour week (MM paragraph 124(i)).  I find from
   the information provided by the appellant and the evidence of the sponsor
   (a transparently honest and reliable witness) that it is more likely than
   not that on arrival in Aberdeen he will find  employment.  Setting  aside
   the strict  financial  requirements  in  the  Rules,  which  exclude  any
   possible earnings of the appellant, it is much more likely than not  that
   he and the sponsor can adequately  maintain  and  accommodate  themselves
   without recourse to public funds.  (They have no dependants.)

11) The sponsor tried living in Morocco and  found  it,  for  understandable
   reasons, not much to her taste.  Visiting for a period of weeks  or  even
   months is one thing, but adapting to a permanent life there is  something
   else.  The evidence is entirely persuasive as to why it  is  much  easier
   for the appellant to adapt to life in Aberdeen.   He  is  fluent  in  the
   language and unlike the  appellant  as  a  foreign  woman  moving  around
   Agadir, there is no difficulty  at  all  in  the  appellant  adapting  to
   Aberdeen.  He has an immaculate history of compliance with UK immigration
   requirements.

12)  Other  than  the  (possible)  desirability  of  100%  compliance   with
   inflexible rules, there is nothing to weigh on the public  interest  side
   of the balance.  The obstacles to the appellant and the sponsor  carrying
   on married life in Morocco are  not  literally  insurmountable,  but  the
   reasons for not putting the sponsor  to  such  a  stark  choice  and  the
   reasons for preferring residence in the UK are so  strong  as  to  render
   insistence on refusal  of  entry  clearance  a  clearly  disproportionate
   measure.

13) The determination of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.  The  appeal,
   as originally brought  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  is  allowed  under
   Article 8 of the ECHR.
