Miss A Holmes for the Secretary of State
No appearance for the claimant

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   This is a Home Office appeal against the  decision  of  an  adjudicator,
   Mr S Qureshi, allowing an appeal against refusal of a family visit visa.
   The claimant had applied to visit his family in  this  country  for  one
   year,  ticking  the  box  rather  surprisingly  provided  opposite   the
   description "Visitor".  He had apparently done so  despite  the  leaflet
   handed out, making it clear that "you are not allowed to work in the  UK
   and you must intend to leave after a maximum of six months" and  on  the
   basis of a letter from his uncle offering to sponsor him "for  a  period
   of one year's vacation in the UK".

2. The adjudicator seems to have decided this case on the basis that "I  do
   not hold the application to come as a visitor for one year  against  the
   appellant since that mistake was made by the sponsor  who  thought  that
   was possible.  He has since realised his error and wishes the  appellant
   to only come for six months".  That is in essence  the  sole  ground  of
   appeal, since the relevant paragraph  of  the  Rules,  paragraph  41(1),
   requires a person seeking leave to enter as a visitor to  show  that  he
   intends to stay for a period not exceeding six months.  The  adjudicator
   apparently took the view that this was capable of being  modified  after
   the date of the decision under appeal.
3. We disagree: this is not a case such as those  described  as  SK  [2002]
   UKIAT  05613*, which amounted to an effective judicial repeal of � 77(4)
   of the 1999 Act: rather it is a question  of  the  requirements  of  the
   statute and Rules as to which decisions are subject to statutory appeal,
   and which are not.  This was a decision to refuse a  visit  visa  for  a
   period of twelve months: by � 60 (7)(c) of the 1999 Act, refusal on  the
   ground that  a  period  was  sought  exceeding  that  permitted  by  the
   Immigration Rules does not entitle a person to appeal.

4. That was the situation faced by the adjudicator in this case; and in our
   view he should have refused to entertain the appeal at all.  However, we
   must go on to say that  we  regard  the  application  form  as  we  have
   described it as somewhat misleading: it is called IM2A.  We  think  that
   the line which begins "Visitor" urgently needs to be redesigned.  It may
   or may not be that the claimant did intend at the date  of  decision  to
   stay for more than six months, so that the application should have  been
   refused on its merits in any case; but, since there is no appeal  before
   us, that is not for us to say.  We hope that any future  application  by
   him will be considered on its merits; but  on  this  occasion  the  Home
   Office appeal is allowed.

                                                                       [pic]

                                                                  (chairman)
