                             DECISION ON APPEAL

Mr R Solomon (counsel instructed by  Bart Williams & Co) for the appellant
Mr T Wilkie for the respondent

  This is an appeal from a decision of an  adjudicator  (Mr  DJ  Boyd  QC),
  sitting at Staines on 29 November, dismissing an asylum and human  rights
  appeal by a citizen of the Russian Federation, from removal directions as
  an illegal entrant on 1 June 2001. Leave was given on the basis  that  it
  was  "arguable  that  the  Adjudicator's  findings  on  the   applicant's
  objections to performing military service are flawed".


2. The adjudicator took the view that


   a) the appellant, as a partial conscientious objector, did not qualify on
      the basis of his principles alone, as the war in Chechnya, to which he
      objected, had not been "internationally condemned";
  b) the conditions of service  he  faced  would  not  infringe  his  human
     rights; and
   c) the seven years'  maximum  term  of  imprisonment  he  faced  was  not
      disproportionate.


   These represent the general grounds of  objection  to  military  service
   left open under the Refugee Convention by the Court of Appeal in Sepet &
   Bulbul [2001] EWCA Civ 681 � 61 (Laws LJ). The issues before us on  that
   are as follows:


   a) Does a particular war need to have been  "internationally  condemned"
      before an asylum-seeker can succeed in  a  claim  under  the  Refugee
      Convention on the basis of a partial objection to it? If yes, has the
      conflict in Chechnya been "internationally condemned"? If no, does it
      meet whatever is the appropriate test?
   b)  Would  the  conditions  of  service  faced  by  this  appellant   be
      "themselves so harsh as to amount to persecution on the facts"?  (see
      Laws LJ, above)
   c) Is seven years' imprisonment  disproportionate  in  itself?  If  not,
      would the actual conditions of imprisonment be so?


   It will not be necessary for us to consider  the  effect  of  the  Human
   Rights Convention, as it is agreed that conditions which met  the  tests
   at b) or c) above would also amount to "inhuman or degrading  treatment"
   under article 3 (and vice versa), unless we should reject one or more of
   the above heads of the  appellant's  case  for  not  showing  a  Refugee
   Convention reason.


3. On a), Mr Solomon relied on the decision of the Tribunal (Storey and  Fox
   VPP) in  Foughali  [00/TH/01513].  Agreeing  with  some,  but  not  other
   previous decisions, they said (� 33):

   ... whilst this category may include participation  in  a  war  which  is
   internationally condemned, its defining characteristic  and  hallmark  is
   service in a military which breaches international standards ...

   The Court of Appeal (see above) in  Sepet  had  stated  the  category  as
   military service involving acts contrary to basic rules of human conduct;
   but Mr Solomon was unable to refer us to anything in their decision which
   settled any argument as to whether the nature of the conflict had  to  be
   "internationally condemned". The UNHCR Handbook refers to it (� 171) as

   ... military action ...  condemned  by  the  international  community  as
   contrary to basic rules of human conduct ...

   Those words of the Handbook have stood for a  very  long  time:  although
   they do not have the force of law, they represent the nearest approach so
   far to an international code of refugee law, and there are sound  reasons
   of international comity why  the  legitimacy  of  a  particular  campaign
   should not be passed on by  either  an  individual  asylum-seeker  or  an
   individual  court,  but  left  to  the  judgment  of  the   international
   community. We regret  we  are  unable  to  agree  with  the  approach  in
   Foughali.

4. There is nothing to show that the current conflict in Chechnya  has  been
   condemned by any official  international  body,  either  as  to  aims  or
   methods. Probably the most authoritative body in this context is  the  UN
   Commission on Human Rights: while the Human Rights Watch report for  2002
   before us shows (bundle pp 87-88)  that  the  UNCHR  has  for  two  years
   running expressed (no doubt rightly) "grave concern  about  human  rights
   violations in Chechnya",  "Notably  it  fell  short  of  calling  for  an
   international  commission  of  inquiry".  That  is  well  short  of   the
   international  condemnation  which  in  our  view  is  required  for  the
   appellant to succeed on this point.

5. Turning to b), there is a reference in  the  UNHCR  background  paper  of
   November 2000 at the end of � 5.5 to the "violent  hazing  [American  for
   "bullying": it echoes a passage in the State Department  report]  of  new
   recruits"; in the Amnesty International report for 2001 (bundle pp 97-98)
   there is a reference to "widespread  torture  and  ill-treatment  in  the
   armed forces", said to have  resulted  in  the  deaths  of  a  number  of
   soldiers  and  officers;  but  the  examples  given  all  come  from  one
   particular unit (72nd regiment, 42nd army division). The CIPU  report  (�
   6.6) is in general terms, and  mainly  relies  on  the  sources  we  have
   already quoted. No doubt there is serious bullying in the Russian  forces
   in Chechnya (as regrettably occurs even in much better-regulated armies);
   however not only is there no indication of any Refugee Convention  reason
   behind any selection of the victims, but there is nothing  to  show  that
   service in those forces for any individual is likely to  carry  any  real
   risk of ill-treatment either amounting  to  persecution  or  "inhuman  or
   degrading treatment" contrary to article 3. As Mr Wilkie pointed out, the
   ill-treatment this appellant claimed to have  suffered  (decision  �  13)
   amounted to two incidents only: once he was kicked for refusing  to  hand
   over money,  and  once  beaten  for  insolence  to  a  superior  officer.
   Regrettable as those incidents were, we do not consider that either  this
   appellant's history or general conditions suggest that he faced any  real
   risk of conditions of service amounting to persecution (or  art.  3  ill-
   treatment) in themselves.

6. On c), we agree with the view expressed by the Tribunal in Foughali  that
   a substantial period of imprisonment (in that case 2-10 years, in this 3-
   7) cannot be regarded as disproportionate in itself for  refusing  active
   military service. It may well be argued that the more dangerous that  may
   be, the more serious a  deterrent  is  required.  On  the  conditions  of
   imprisonment, bad as they are, we see nothing to indicate that  they  are
   in any  way  discriminatorily  applied  to  conscientious  objectors.  It
   follows that the appellant cannot succeed on this point under the Refugee
   Convention, for lack of a Convention reason. So  we  have  to  go  on  to
   consider whether the conditions of any imprisonment he might  face  would
   amount to "inhuman or degrading treatment".

7. Mr Wilkie's first point was that in practice he was not  likely  to  face
   imprisonment at all, given that there are said (CIPU report  6.4)  to  be
   1,500 deserters lurking in Moscow, and 12,000 nationwide.  However,  even
   supposing those figures are at all accurate (and  by  their  nature  they
   must be mainly guesswork), there is evidence, not abundant but  some,  of
   prosecutions taking place. Whatever the opportunities  for  sidling  into
   Moscow overland and then lurking on the fringes of  society,  they  would
   not exist for  someone  facing  return  there  by  air  through  official
   channels. Certainly the appellant might avoid those by making a voluntary
   departure, possibly overland; but he would still most likely have to pass
   frontier control at some point, unlike deserters returning directly  from
   Chechnya. In our view there is a real  risk  of  the  appellant's  facing
   whatever punishment is in practice applied to deserters.

8. We should make it clear that all  the  evidence  put  before  us  on  the
   conditions of  imprisonment  applied  to  prisoners,  including  ordinary
   criminal prisoners, in general. Mr Solomon's first  point  was  that  the
   rarity of bail, and the delays in the process, result in  "many  suspects
   remaining in pre-trial detention for longer than the maximum penalty they
   might face if convicted". Deplorable as this is,  he  could  not  however
   refer us to any evidence that such persons would not receive  credit  for
   the time they had spent awaiting trial, which we should expect to see  if
   that were the position. We do not see any real risk  of  a  conscientious
   objector facing a total sentence of more than seven years.

9. As for the conditions themselves, the  UNHCR  background  paper  (�  4.3)
   quotes the State Department report for 1999: the particular points  noted
   are not replicated in that for 2000  (appellant's  solicitors'  bundle  p
   13), though that still concludes that "Prison  conditions  are  extremely
   harsh and frequently life threatening". As usual, a detailed critique  is
   given, and we have no doubt that conditions for the average  prisoner  in
   Russia  are  deeply  unpleasant.  There  is  however  no  indication   of
   deliberate torture or ill-treatment being prevalent, and the  defects  in
   the system appear to be the result of institutional incompetence and lack
   of resources. There is no doubt a point  at  which  even  unintended  bad
   conditions reach the level of "inhuman or degrading  treatment":  clearly
   the standard is a general one, and if they are to be so  regarded  for  a
   conscientious objector, then the same judgment must apply  in  the  case,
   for example, of a convicted murderer. If such a person were to escape  to
   this country, then in those circumstances he would be entitled to  resist
   removal on that basis (cf. Chahal v. United Kingdom [1996]  23  EHRR  413
   ECtHR). No doubt the appellate authorities  would  not  shrink  from  the
   consequences of that decision; but it is some indication of  the  serious
   nature of the considerations involved. In our  view,  the  conditions  of
   imprisonment in the Russian Federation generally do not  raise  any  real
   risk of to torture or other degrading or inhuman treatment,  contrary  to
   art. 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights. It  follows  that  the
   appeal is dismissed.
