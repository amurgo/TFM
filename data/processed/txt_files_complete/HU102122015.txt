                      ERROR OF LAW FINDING AND REASONS


     1. This is an appeal against a decision of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
        Pickup promulgated on 4 January 2017 in which the  Judge  dismissed
        the appellant's appeal on all grounds.



Background


     2. The appellant, a citizen of Pakistan, was born on 19 June 1982.  He
        appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  against  the  respondent's
        decision, dated 22 October 2015, to refuse an application  made  on
        28 September 2015 for leave to remain in the United Kingdom on  the
        grounds of his private and family life.
     3. The appellant entered the United Kingdom  lawfully  in  2010  as  a
        student but overstayed when that leave  expired  and  has  remained
        without leave since. The appellant met Ms Quinn, a British citizen,
        in 2012 and married in an Islamic marriage ceremony on 30  November
        2012 and then under UK civil law on 7 February 2013. There  are  no
        children of the relationship.
     4. The Judge sets out findings of fact from [13] of the decision under
        challenge which can be summarised in the following terms:


                a. That the appeal hinges on  the  issue  of  insurmountable
                   circumstances with reliance being placed by the appellant
                   on Ms  Quinn's  personal  and  medical  circumstances  to
                   render  the  decision   of   the   Secretary   of   State
                   disproportionate [17] and [27].
                b.  In  relation  to  EX1,  the  appellant  has  failed   to
                   demonstrate insurmountable obstacles to continuing family
                   life with his partner outside  the  UK,  in  Pakistan  in
                   which, by EX2, could not be overcome or would entail very
                   serious hardship for either of them [30].
                c. If Mrs Quinn chose to relocate to Pakistan, a  matter  of
                   her choice, they will be able to  continue  their  family
                   life [30].
                d. The Judge accepted the evidence  of  Ms  Quinn's  medical
                   condition and her age but thereafter finds:


                      "However, the most that could  be  said  is  that  it
                      would be difficult and inconvenient for Ms  Quinn  to
                      relocate to Pakistan, given her family connections in
                      the UK, and  that  obtaining  medical  treatment  and
                      medication   for   her   arthritis-related    medical
                      conditions might  be  expensive  for  them.  However,
                      expense  alone  does  not  render  the  circumstances
                      insurmountable   or   the   difficulties   so    very
                      significant that they could not be overcome or  which
                      would entail "very serious  hardship".  There  is  no
                      evidence presented to me that medical treatment would
                      not be available to Ms Quinn.  I  was  not  presented
                      with any costings of medication, and  note  that  the
                      refusal decision explains that medical  treatment  is
                      widely available in Pakistan, supported  by  extracts
                      from  country  background  information.   Orthopaedic
                      check-ups are available in Pakistan, both within  and
                      out-patient treatment by GP and/or rheumatologist. Ms
                      Quinn would also be able to  continue  to  receive  a
                      state pension whilst in Pakistan. The appellant  will
                      be able to work and provide for  them,  and  continue
                      his care and support or employ others to do so.


                e. The Judge finds that while Ms Quinn may face cultural and
                   language obstacles to her integration in Pakistan she has
                   the assistance of the  appellant  and  has  converted  to
                   Islam. The Judge took into account submissions  Ms  Quinn
                   will be relocating as a mature woman and  leaving  behind
                   her adult son  and  regular  contact  with  other  family
                   members, that she has lived all her life in  the  UK  and
                   has no experience of life in Pakistan, but did not accept
                   that  these  would  entail  very  serious   hardship   or
                   difficulties that could not be overcome [31].
                f. It was found the appellant cannot meet  the  requirements
                   of Appendix FM  in  relation  to  family  live  with  his
                   partner [32].
                g. The appellant cannot meet the requirements  of  paragraph
                   276 ADE and has failed to  demonstrate  very  significant
                   difficulties to his integration in Pakistan, particularly
                   given that  he  was  living  there  until  2010  and  has
                   retained his family, social and cultural ties,  including
                   language [33].
                h. The Judge concludes that taking the evidence as a  whole,
                   on the most generous basis in the appellant's favour,  he
                   was  not  satisfied  that  there  are  any   sufficiently
                   compelling circumstances inadequately recognised  in  the
                   Rules to justify granting leave  to  remain  outside  the
                   Rules under article 8 ECHR [34].
                i. The Judge found the appellant entered into a relationship
                   with Ms Quinn at a  time  when  not  only  had  his  visa
                   expired so that he was  unlawfully  present  as  an  over
                   stayer but that he had stopped studying more than a  year
                   before he met her; indicating that he had  and  continues
                   to have  no  intention  of  returning  to  Pakistan.  The
                   appellant has no legitimate expectation of being able  to
                   remain in the United Kingdom. Previous applications  have
                   been refused.  The  appellant  and  Ms  Quinn  must  have
                   entered the relationship in the foreknowledge he  had  no
                   basis to  remain  and  their  relationship  was  entirely
                   precarious. That Ms Quinn has family in the UK with  whom
                   she has good relationships does not render  the  decision
                   unjustifiably harsh [34].
                j. If going on to consider Article 8 outside the  Rules  and
                   applying the Razgar stepped approach, the Judge concludes
                   the decision is proportionate [35 - 39].


     5. The appellant sought permission to appeal on two grounds the  first
        of which asserts the Judge erred in his application  of  EX.1.  The
        second ground asserts the Judge fails to take material matters into
        consideration, namely the appellant's  wife's  disability  and  her
        receipt of Attendance Allowance.
     6. Permission to appeal was granted by another judge of the First-tier
        Tribunal in the following terms:


             The Applicant seeks permission to appeal  in  time  against  a
             decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Pickup)  who  in  a
             decision  promulgated  on  4  January   2017   dismissed   the
             Appellant's appeal on human rights grounds. The grounds in the
             permission application argue  that  the  Judge  erred  in  his
             application of the Immigration Rules paragraph EX1 of Appendix
             FM. It is argued that the Appellants partner's eligibility the
             receipt  of  attendance  allowance  means  that  he  met   the
             financial requirements  of  Appendix  FM  of  the  Immigration
             Rules. However, the Appellant was obliged  to  fall  back  and
             rely on EX.1 because he could not meet the immigration  status
             requirement. It is argued that Appendix FM  does  not  include
             consideration  of   the   question   whether   it   would   be
             disproportionate to expect an Applicant to return to his  home
             country to make  an  entry  clearance  application  to  rejoin
             family members in the UK. It is argued that the  judge  failed
             to consider the Appellants wife's disability and  her  receipt
             of attendance allowance and the judge correctly says that  she
             may continue to receive her pension but  the  same  cannot  be
             said about her entitlement to attendance allowance which would
             cease were she  to  reside  in  Pakistan  and  that  this  was
             relevant under paragraph EX.1 and Article  8.  Entitlement  to
             attendance allowance and its loss  were  she  to  relocate  to
             Pakistan were relevant as is the loss of entitlement  to  free
             health care under the NHS.  It  is  argued  that  the  judge's
             consideration  is  therefore  incomplete.  All   grounds   are
             arguable and there is an arguable error of law in  the  manner
             in which the Judge apply the evidence to  paragraph  EX.1  and
             article 8.


     7. The respondent opposes the application in a Rule 24 response  dated
        25 August 2017.




Error of law


     8. The appellant's wife's medical condition is accepted by  the  Judge
        and it is not disputed that payment  is  also  made  of  Attendance
        Allowance. Documentary evidence of this appears in  the  bundle  by
        way of a letter from the Department of  Work  and  Pensions  and  a
        letter addressed to the appellant relating to payment of  a  Carers
        Allowance.
     9. I record at this point  an  issue  raised  by  Mr  McVeety  in  his
        submissions which is that the appellants claim for and receipt of a
        carers allowance is and has always been unlawful as such  allowance
        will not be paid to a person under immigration control. As  stated,
        this was a matter that was raised at the error of law  hearing  and
        not before the First-tier Tribunal.
    10. It was not disputed that the pension paid to the  appellant's  wife
        will continue. A State pension of �144.73 a  week  appears  in  the
        letter of 20 April 2016 which appears to be the figure, adjusted in
        accordance with any annual increases, the Judge found will continue
        to be received by Mrs Quinn. There is also a pension credit  �17.42
        paid according to the same correspondence.
    11. The Judge clearly considered the evidence with the required  degree
        of anxious scrutiny and has given  adequate  reasons  for  findings
        made.
    12. In relation to EX.1. It is not argued the Judge misdirected himself
        at [27] of the decision under challenge. The issue was whether  the
        appellant had demonstrated there will be  insurmountable  obstacles
        to continuing family life with his wife outside the United Kingdom.
        The Judge defines his understanding of such a term as "...which  is
        defined as very significant difficulties which  will  be  faced  by
        either of them and which could  not  be  overcome  or  which  would
        entail very serious hardship for either of them".
    13. Mr Karnik, in  his  submissions,  addressed  the  question  of  the
        payment of the attendance allowance at some length. It was  pointed
        out that such allowance is only paid if the need arises as  is  the
        carers allowance.
    14. It is known the carers allowance helps with extra costs if a person
        has a disability severe enough that they need someone to help  look
        after them and that a carer can get �62.70 a week if they care  for
        someone for at least 35 hours a week and they get certain benefits,
        subject to the exclusion is not being applicable.
    15. The starting point for the Judge is the appellant's wife's  medical
        condition as it is that that gives rise to the  entitlement  within
        the United Kingdom to the payment of attendance allowance  to  help
        with the extra costs of living in the UK. It was not made out  that
        the appellants wife's medical condition comes anywhere near meeting
        the article 3 threshold.
    16. The Judge was not required to assess the matter in  anything  other
        than the manner in which he did. In ZZ  (Tanzania)  v  SSHD  [2014]
        EWCA Civ 1404 the Rwandan claimant's wife was disabled.  The  Court
        of Appeal said that there was no authority for the submission  that
        in deportation cases, the fact that a spouse, partner or  dependent
        family member of the prospective deportee was disabled  within  the
        meaning of the 2010 Act, must be given separate consideration  from
        other   aspects   of   the   balancing   exercise.    Any    caring
        responsibilities  could  be  put  into  the  scale,  and  if  those
        responsibilities were towards a family  member  who  was  seriously
        ill, that was likely to carry greater weight than those  towards  a
        family member in good health.   The  assessment  did  not  need  to
        incorporate references to the  public-sector  equality  duty  under
        section 149 of  the  2010  Act,  and  still  less  to  the  complex
        jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights on  Article  14
        of the ECHR.
    17. The Judge was aware of the need for medication, which was found  to
        be available within Pakistan, and also for the need to consider the
        cost  and  ability  to  fund  the  same,   together   with   caring
        arrangements. The specific finding at [30]  that  "Ms  Quinn  would
        also be able to continue to  receive  a  state  pension  whilst  in
        Pakistan. The appellant will be able to work and provide for  them,
        and continue his care and support, or employ others to do so" shows
        these issues were not  only  considered  but  appropriate  findings
        made. The fact  the  appellant's  wife  will  lose  her  Attendance
        Allowance  when  she  leaves  the  United  Kingdom   is   not   the
        determinative factor. So far as that allowance  is  paid  to  cover
        additional costs of living in the UK,  it  could  be  argued  those
        costs will no longer be present. In relation to the costs of having
        to live and function in Pakistan the Judge found  that  such  costs
        could be reasonably met without the attendance allowance.
    18. In relation to caring needs, it was not made out  on  the  evidence
        before the Judge at the appellant needed to be a  full-time  carer.
        The Judge clearly addressed the availability of care. To  this  end
        it was noted by the Judge that the appellant's wife is treated with
        anti-inflammatory medication.
    19. It was not made out on the evidence before the Judge that the  loss
        of the Attendance Allowance if the appellant's wife relocated  with
        him to Pakistan  would  create  a  situation  which  could  not  be
        overcome or which would entail very serious hardship.  The  finding
        by the Judge that the situation could be overcome and that any such
        hardship was not made out is within the range of findings available
        to the Judge on the evidence.
    20. If the appellant's wife chooses not to join him in Pakistan, as the
        Judge recognises would fall within the scope of  choices  available
        to her, she will remain in  the  United  Kingdom  with  family  and
        access to medical and other services; some of which she could  fund
        by the benefits she would continue to receive. It was not made  out
        on the evidence before the Judge that the  appellants  presence  in
        the United Kingdom was the determinative factor.
    21. It is said in the grounds that an attendance allowance is  paid  in
        order to allow the appellant's wife to make  necessary  adjustments
        for her disability but that is for necessary adjustments within the
        United Kingdom.  It was not made out that the  same  could  not  be
        facilitated Pakistan even without the attendance allowance. Loss of
        benefits flowing from the appellant's  wife's  British  nationality
        are issues that have been considered by the senior  courts  and  do
        not amount to insurmountable obstacles.
    22. As stated above, there is no discriminatory effect of the decision.
        The decision is in accordance with the law. The loss of entitlement
        will be to an entitlement  paid  to  a  person  within  the  United
        Kingdom. That applies to all those entitled and  no  discriminatory
        effect upon any particular group has been made out. As stated,  the
        Court of Appeal considered the situation for a disabled partner  in
        ZZ (Tanzania).
    23. The Judge is also criticised for the finding at [37] in  which  the
        Judge finds "This is not a Chikwamba situation, as it is  far  from
        clear on the limited evidence whether an application from  Pakistan
        for entry clearance as a spouse will succeed.  The  appellant  will
        have to meet the financial minimum income threshold  requirements".
        The grounds assert legal error on the basis there  is  no  need  to
        meet the �18,600 minimum income  threshold  when  a  person  is  in
        receipt  of  state  benefits.  This  is  arguably  correct  as  the
        requirement is to prove that maintenance and accommodation  can  be
        covered without further recourse to public funds.
    24. This is, however, not the core finding  of  the  Judge.  The  Judge
        found the appellant could not succeed under Appendix FM and that is
        a decision that has not been shown to be infected by arguable legal
        error. The Judge at [35] found there  was  no  reason  to  consider
        article 8 ECHR on the basis  that  all  the  relevant  facts  being
        considered could be determined under the Rules. The primary finding
        is that the appellant could not succeed under the rules or  article
        8.
    25. In the alternative, the  Judge  examined  the  case  from  [35]  by
        reference to Razgar.  The Judge adopted the structured approach and
        considered the points for  and  against  within  the  body  of  the
        determination. The Judge found the decision will be proportionate.
    26. The case of Chikwamba related to a policy decision by the Secretary
        State that people should not be permitted to 'jump the  queue'  and
        should return to their home state for  the  purposes  of  making  a
        fresh application, in line. In that case it was  not  possible  for
        the family to return to Zimbabwe together with their child  because
        the appellant's partner had been recognised as a refugee  from  the
        country to which the  appellant  was  to  be  returned,  making  it
        impossible  for  the  partner  to  return  with  the  appellant  to
        Zimbabwe. The Court found it unacceptable to  expect  a  person  to
        return to their home state in such circumstances just  to  make  an
        application to return to the United Kingdom in relation to which it
        was argued they would succeed.
    27. The Secretary State refers to the more recent decision of R (on the
        application  of  Chen)  v  Secretary  State  the  Home   Department
        (Appendix FM - Chikwamba - temporary separation -  proportionality)
        IJR [2015] UKUT 00189 which examined this issue in the  context  of
        Appendix FM. In the appeal under consideration, it is important  to
        recognise that Judge Pickup is not finding the appellant should  go
        to Pakistan with his wife remaining in the United Kingdom whilst he
        made an application to return, as the Judge found that family  life
        can continue with the appellant and his  wife  living  in  Pakistan
        together.
    28. In R (on the application of Chen) it was held that (i) Appendix  FM
        does not include consideration of the question whether it would  be
        disproportionate to expect an individual  to  return  to  his  home
        country to make an entry clearance application  to  re-join  family
        members in the U.K. There may  be  cases  in  which  there  are  no
        insurmountable obstacles to family life being enjoyed  outside  the
        U.K. but where temporary separation to enable an individual to make
        an application for entry clearance may be disproportionate. In  all
        cases, it will be for the individual to place before the  Secretary
        of State evidence that such  temporary  separation  will  interfere
        disproportionately with protected rights. It will not be enough  to
        rely solely upon the case-law concerning Chikwamba  v  SSHD  [2008]
        UKHL 40. (ii) Lord Brown was not laying down a legal test  when  he
        suggested in  Chikwamba  that  requiring  a  claimant  to  make  an
        application for entry clearance would only  "comparatively  rarely"
        be proportionate in a case involving children (per Burnett J, as he
        then was, in R (Kotecha and Das v SSHD [2011] EWHC 2070 (Admin)).
    29. Having considered the  issues  raised  by  the  advocates  in  both
        written and oral  form,  having  considered  that  the  purpose  of
        Article 8 is not enable a person to choose  the  country  in  which
        they wish to live but rather to  prevent  unwarranted  interference
        with a protected right, in light of  the  fact  the  Judge  clearly
        considered  the  evidence  with  the  required  degree  of  anxious
        scrutiny and has given adequate reasons for the findings  made,  in
        light of the fact the core finding that family life can continue in
        Pakistan has not been shown to be infected by material legal error,
        and in light of the fact the appellant failed to place  before  the
        Judge or Secretary of  State  evidence  that  any  separation  will
        interfere disproportionately with protected rights,  this  tribunal
        finds the appellant has failed to make out any arguable legal error
        material to the decision to dismiss the appeal  that  warrants  the
        Upper Tribunal interfering with this decision.  It  is  a  decision
        reasonably open to the Judge on the evidence.
