                          DECISION ON ERROR OF LAW


 1. The Appellant appeals with permission against the  decision  of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Monson dismissing the  Appellant's  appeal  against
    the Respondent's decision to refuse him asylum, humanitarian protection
    or leave under human rights grounds and  a  removal  direction  to  Sri
    Lanka under section 10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999  (IS151B,
    dated 17 December 2012).






 2. The Appellant appealed against that decision and was granted permission
    to appeal by Upper Tribunal Judge Finch on all  grounds,  including  an
    extension of time. The grounds upon which permission was granted may be
    summarised as follows:


      i) As the High Court had found that the basis for a  fresh  claim  for
         asylum had been made out, and given that  two  of  the  Appellant's
         three witnesses had attended an earlier appeal hearing which  could
         not proceed as the Respondent did not have her  file  and  was  not
         ready,  and  given  that  the  Appellant  was  represented  at  the
         subsequent CMRH, and given that counsel  appeared  at  the  hearing
         before Judge Monson and said that his clerks could not "trace"  the
         Appellant's solicitors and there being a subsequent letter on  file
         confirming that these solicitors came off record, the  right  to  a
         fresh claim  had  been  granted  on  the  basis  of  new  evidence,
         including further witness  who  were  being  called  to  give  oral
         evidence, it was arguably  not  in  the  interests  of  justice  to
         proceed in the absence of the Appellant and his witnesses when  the
         evidence indicated that the Appellant's solicitors  had  failed  to
         instruct counsel or keep him or the Appellant aware that they  were
         withdrawing their services; and


     ii) Until the fresh evidence and the fresh oral evidence is before  the
         Tribunal, it was arguably  not  possible  to  correctly  apply  the
         Devaseelan principles or ensure that anxious scrutiny  was  applied
         to the fresh claim.






 3. I was provided with a Rule 24 response from the Respondent.





    Discussion


 4. At the close of submissions,  I  indicated  that  I  would  reserve  my
    decision, which I shall now give. I find that there was an error of law
    in the decision such that it should be set aside.  My  reasons  for  so
    finding are as follows.





 5. In relation to the first ground, I heard from Ms Jegarajah that her
    colleague, Mr Paramjorthy was previously instructed by a person named
    "Seval" of TTS Solicitors to represent the Appellant and whom was
    instructed at least at the Case Management Review Hearing ("CMRH"),
    happened to be at the Tribunal the day of the Appellant's substantive
    hearing and as reflected at �30 of the Decision, attended Judge
    Monson's court to assist, de bene esse. As observed by Upper Tribunal
    Judge Finch, the Appellant's solicitors nor the Appellant could be
    "traced". Subsequent to Judge Monson's decision, TTS solicitors came
    off the record and I am told by Ms Jegarajah that the instructing
    solicitor, Seval, has "disappeared".


 6. Mr Duffy did not challenge this evidence but stated it was open to TTS
    solicitors to attend the hearing and ask for an adjournment; however,
    with respect that submission assumes that the solicitors were acting
    according to normal function and competence, and consequently, one
    would assume they would have been "traceable" or could have been
    contacted before the hearing proceeded. Given that counsel previously
    instructed could not trace the solicitors through his clerks, it is
    clear to me that the judge should have paused for further consideration
    of the fairness and justice in proceeding with the hearing than is
    disclosed at �30 wherein it is stated that the judge was "satisfied
    that the appellant had been given adequate notice of the hearing".


 7. It is also unclear whether any attempts were made to contact the
    Appellant's solicitors or the Appellant, which also give cause for
    concern, as this task could not be delegated to counsel as it appears
    to have been whilst he was not instructed to appear. Although counsel
    did his best to assist the Tribunal, he did not owe of course any duty
    to the Appellant to provide him with a fair hearing, whereas the
    Tribunal was under a duty to do so, consider the Appellant's matter
    fairly and allow him to present his evidence. It seems somewhat
    unhelpful to have not received written confirmation from the
    Appellant's solicitors that they were unable to attend or were not
    willing to before deciding to proceed in their or the Appellant's
    absence.


 8. Given that it also appears that the solicitor in question, Seval, has
    disappeared and may implicitly have acted unprofessionally, if not
    negligently, in communicating with the Tribunal as to the whereabouts
    of the Appellant or his representatives on the day of the hearing, I
    find in light of the above discussion that the judge's decision to
    proceed was not in the interests of justice and constituted an error
    such that the decision and reasons should be set aside in their
    entirety.


 9. I am further fortified in this decision as it is noteworthy that this
    appeal represented the independent hearing of a fresh claim which had
    already passed the hurdle of establishing a fresh claim under Rule 353
    and represented a claim that might have a reasonable prospect of
    success before a hypothetical First-tier Tribunal Judge (see Lord
    Justice Buxton's decision in WM (DRC) v SSHD [2006] EWCA Civ 1495 for
    further discussion). The right to a fresh claim had therefore been
    granted on the basis of new evidence presented to the Respondent which
    included further witness testimony which would be obviously embellished
    by oral evidence and legal representation on appeal (see the decision
    of Anthony Thornton QC in ST v SSHD [2012] EWHC 988 (Admin) for further
    discussion). Consequently, it was not in the interests of justice to
    proceed in the absence of the Appellant and his witnesses as their
    evidence was necessary to properly assess whether the previous
    Determination should be departed from or maintained in light of the
    approach outlined in Devaseelan UKIAT [2002] 000702 Starred.


10. In my view it was furthermore not in the interests of justice to
    proceed given that the Appellant had attended both previous hearings
    before the Tribunal, his absence was anomalous, unusual and
    unexplained. Given that two of the Appellant's witnesses had attended
    for a previous substantive hearing (those witnesses were travelling to
    the hearing from Norway and France, whilst the third witness was from
    the UK) on 7 May 2013 before Judge Aujla which could not proceed
    because the Respondent did not have her file and was not ready. The
    Respondent was afforded the opportunity of getting her house in order.
    At the subsequent CMRH it was confirmed by the Appellant that he and
    his witnesses would attend a future substantive hearing, and in their
    absence, and the Appellant's and his representative's absence at that
    hearing, and given the history of these proceedings it was in the
    interests of justice to allow both parties to present their cases
    without hindrance and was inequitable to not do so.


11. I must observe on Judge Monson's behalf that it does not appear from
    his Decision that he was aware, or made aware by the Presenting
    Officer, of the previous adjourned substantive hearing at the
    Respondent's application, which may have affected his decision to
    proceed.




12. In the light of the above findings, I set aside the decision and
    findings in their entirety, as the appeal will need to be re-made de
    novo.




13. As I have allowed the appeal on the first ground, I will not go on to
    consider the second ground, it being rendered moot by my decision on
    the first ground.





    Decision

14. The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is allowed.




15. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.




16. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal, to  be  heard  by  a
    differently constituted bench.


    Anonymity

17. The First-tier Tribunal made an anonymity order which I maintain.
