Representations:

For the Appellant:     Mr R de Mello, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr G Phillips, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.    The Appellant is a citizen of India.

2.    With permission she appeals the determination of an Adjudicator, Mr R
    A Cox, which was promulgated on 18 June 2003.   In  that  determination
    the Adjudicator dismissed the Appellant's appeal against the refusal of
    the Respondent to grant her entry clearance to the United  Kingdom  for
    the   purpose   of   settlement   as   the   adopted   child    of    [
          ] (the Sponsor) and  her  husband  [                     ].   The
    Adjudicator also considered the question of whether the  appeal  should
    have been allowed on Article 8 ECHR grounds and rejected that aspect of
    the appeal.

3.    The Immigration Rule dealing with entry clearance as an adopted child
    is to be found in paragraph 310 of HC 395.  We set out below the  parts
    of the Rule for consideration in this particular appeal.

4.    It is important to note that this Rule was amended on 1  April  2003.
    The Respondent's decision, which is the relevant date for the  purposes
    of this appeal was made on 28 March 2002, before that  amendment.   The
    Adjudicator's decision  was  promulgated  after  it.     It  is  to  be
    conveniently found, in the appropriate form, in the second  edition  of
    Immigration Law Handbook.

5.    We note that the amendment may have a significant impact on any fresh
    application if the Appellant could overcome the problem with which  the
    rest of this determination is concerned.

6.    Rule 310, so far as relevant reads as follows:-

    "310.  The requirements to be met  in  the  case  of  a  child  seeking
    indefinite leave to enter the United Kingdom as the adopted child of  a
    parent or parents present and settled or being admitted for  settlement
    in the United Kingdom are that he:


           (i)   is seeking leave to enter to accompany or join an adoptive
      parent or parents in one of the following circumstances;
                 (a)   both parents are present and settled in  the  United
      Kingdom; ..... and
           (ii)  is under the age of 18; and
           (iii) is not leading an independent life, is unmarried, and  has
      not formed an independent family unit; and
           (iv)  can, and will, be accommodated adequately without recourse
      to public funds in accommodation which the adoptive parent or parents
      own or occupy exclusively; and
           (v)   can, and will be maintained  adequately  by  the  adoptive
      parent or parents without recourse to public funds; and
           (vi)  was adopted in accordance with a  decision  taken  by  the
      competent administrative authority or court in his country of  origin
      or the country in which he is resident; and
           (vii) was adopted at a time when:
                 (a)   both adoptive parents were resident together abroad;
      or
                 (b)   either or both adoptive parents were settled in  the
      United Kingdom; and
           (viii)      has the same rights and  obligations  as  any  other
      child of the marriage; and
           (ix)  was adopted due to the inability of the original parent(s)
      or current carer(s) to care for him and  there  has  been  a  genuine
      transfer of parental responsibility to the adoptive parents; and
           (x)   has lost or broken his ties with his family of origin; and
           (xi)  was adopted, but the adoption is not  one  of  convenience
      arranged to facilitate his admission to or remaining  in  the  United
      Kingdom; and
           (xii) holds a valid United Kingdom entry clearance for entry  in
      this capacity."


      It is the meaning of the word  inability  in  para  310(ix)  and  its
    relevance on the facts of this  appeal,   with  which  we  are  largely
    concerned.

7.    The Adjudicator did not find the Sponsor a credible witness.  He gave
    a number of reasons for saying that and there a number of  reasons  why
    he  dismissed  the  appeal.   The  question  of  credibility   impacted
    particularly on the Adjudicator's finding as  to  whether  or  not  the
    adoption was one of convenience and  also  whether  there  had  been  a
    genuine transfer of parental responsibility.  However, it seems  to  us
    that the Appellant could not succeed in any event on the facts as  they
    were asserted to the Adjudicator.

8.    The Appellant's story, as it  appeared  to  the  Adjudicator,  is  as
    follows.  The Sponsor's husband has two brothers and two  sisters,  all
    whom are married.  With the exception of one brother, they all live  in
    India.  The Sponsor herself also has a sizeable family in  India.   The
    Sponsor's husband's younger brother, [                ], lives with his
    family in Diwali, a district of Jalandhar.  They had  two  children,  a
    daughter who at the time of the Adjudicator's determination  was  about
    15, and a son who was then 13.  That son,  tragically,  had  a  serious
    accident when he was  aged  3.   He  broke  his  hip  and  leg  and  is
    handicapped.  The Sponsor, in a statement said that  because  of  their
    son's disability, [               ] and his wife tried to have  another
    male child.  The Adjudicator quoted from the Sponsor's statement and we
    can do no better:-

         "After this incident the parents were trying for a male child.  On
         24 July 1996 [               ], my sister-in-law, gave birth to  a
         baby girl.  Immediately after her birth the  mother  rejected  the
         child as she was hoping for a baby boy.   Both  the  parents  were
         very upset and distressed at the thought that they  would  not  be
         able to provide a good standard of living and  good  education  to
         the three children, one being handicapped  and  the  others  being
         daughters.  They were thinking she is a  burden  and  they  cannot
         financially cope with it.  Because still  in  India  people  think
         daughters to be a burden, as the parents not only have to bear the
         expense of their upbringing but also marry them as  well.   People
         are generally frightened about the dowry system.  After the second
         day of the birth of the child I went to see the family  and  found
         out how the parents felt about their daughter.  I tried to console
         and assured them to financially help them as when required.   This
         did not have any impact on  my  sister-in-law  and  she  completed
         rejected the child and even refused to  feed  it.   On  the  other
         hand, I did not have a daughter which  I  and  my  husband  always
         wanted.  That is why we tried for a third child after the birth of
         a second son, but it was a boy again.  So on the same day I phoned
         my husband and explained the  whole  situation  and  expressed  my
         desire to adopt the daughter.  My husband was fully agreed with me
         and suggested me to take away the child immediately  and  complete
         the adoption formalities later on."

9.    When the Sponsor suggested adoption to the Appellant's parents,  they
    agreed immediately.  The Sponsor took the child away to her own village
    on the basis that she and her husband would  take  full  responsibility
    for the child and bring her up as  their  daughter.   Some  formalities
    were dealt with and an adoption deed registered  on  29  January  1997.
    The Appellant remained living with the Sponsor and  her  parents-in-law
    until the Sponsor  came  to  the  United  Kingdom  in  May  1998.   The
    Appellant remained with the Sponsor's in-laws until  her  mother-in-law
    died in June 1999.  Her elderly father-in-law could not  properly  look
    after the Appellant and an arrangement was made for  the  Appellant  to
    live with the Sponsor's sister about four or five miles away.  That  is
    where she remains.

10.   The Adjudicator rejected the appeal for a number of reasons  but  his
    first finding was that  the  Appellant  was  not  adopted  due  to  the
    inability of the original parents to care for her, but  rather  because
    of their unwillingness to do so.

11.   Mr de Mello argued  that  the  adoption  did  occur  because  of  the
    inability of the original  parents  to  care  for  the  Appellant.   In
    support of that he referred us to a passage in MacDonald's  Immigration
    Law and Practice, 5th Edition at paragraph 11.93.  It says this:-

         "Inability to care should not be interpreted more strictly than in
         the 'exclusion undesirable' cases and  thus  a  clearly  evidenced
         rejection of a child by its natural parents or abuse of the  child
         will suffice.  Incapability includes not just actual inability but
         also unwillingness to care."

      MacDonald cites a decision Asima  Kausar  00/TH/1572.   Mr  de  Mello
    referred to that authority in his skeleton argument but did not have it
    to hand for the hearing.  We were  able  to  retrieve  a  copy  of  the
    decision of a Tribunal chaired by His Honour Judge Lakin, sitting  with
    two lay members and promulgated on 26 June 2000.  In Kausar, there  was
    a factually complicated situation.  The  Sponsor's  daughter  lived  in
    Pakistan and had three children.  She was effectively deserted  by  her
    husband (the children's father).  He had gone illegally to the USA,  to
    try and improve his economic position, but made no attempt, apart  from
    one remittance of �50,  to  keep  in  touch  with  his  children.   The
    sponsor's daughter died  (aged 36) only six months after the  birth  of
    the third child.  The father of the children would not come  back  from
    the United States and the Sponsor's wife looked after the  children  in
    Pakistan for a number of years.  The Sponsor himself  remained  in  the
    United Kingdom because of work commitments.  After  about  three  years
    the Sponsor's wife, who survived on money sent back by the Sponsor  was
    unable to cope and the Sponsor became concerned about  the  welfare  of
    the children.  Their father was prepared to  sign  a  document  handing
    over responsibility for the children.  The Sponsor's wife  then  became
    seriously ill and came back to the United Kingdom, leaving the children
    in the care of the Sponsor's brother.  The Sponsor's wife then died  in
    the UK.  The Sponsor continued to  send  money  back  to  maintain  the
    children.  The issue in that case, as in this, included the question of
    a de facto adoption.  But in Kausar the Presenting Officer also  argued
    that any transfer of parental responsibility to  the  Sponsor  had  not
    been because of the children's  father's  inability  to  care  for  the
    children but because he was unwilling  to  do  so.   The  Appellant  in
    Kausar argued that the Tribunal should not give the  word  inability  a
    strict  literal  interpretation,  but  should  adopt  a  broader   more
    humanitarian approach.  He argued  that  the  Rules  were  intended  to
    promote family life and should be interpreted accordingly and  that  it
    would wholly wrong to dismiss the appeal on a technicality of language.
     The Tribunal appears to have accepted that argument and said:-

         "Viewed in the context of this case, it  is  perfectly  proper  to
         interpret the word in such a way as to  include  unwillingness  in
         the sense of a self imposed inability.   If  we  are  wrong  about
         this, the simple fact is that at the  time  when  his  wife  died,
         Tariq was in the USA and has remained in  the  USA.   His  absence
         from Pakistan clearly means that he is  unable  to  care  for  his
         children."

12.   Whether or not that Tribunal was correct in coming to the  conclusion
    it did as to the interpretation of the word inability, it is clear that
    the factual basis of that appeal  was  entirely  different  from  this.
    There, there was an absentee father who could not care for the children
    whilst he was in America.

13.   In contrast in this appeal, it is quite clear that had the  Appellant
    been male, her parents would have had no difficulty  in  looking  after
    her at all.  It is clear from the evidence that having  rejected  their
    daughter they were proposing to try for another son.  The rejection was
    not due to any inability to care but simply a rejection on the basis of
    the child's gender.

14.   We are not satisfied that the Rule was intended to apply to  children
    who were handed over to adoptive parents from choice rather than out of
    necessity.  Sub-paragraph 9 has two parts to it.  The first part refers
    to the inability of the original parents to care for the child, and the
    second a genuine transfer  of  parental  responsibility.   An  entirely
    voluntary handover, by agreement could comply with the second  part  of
    the Rule but not the  first.   Had  it  been  intended  that  the  word
    inability would include unwillingness then there would be no  point  in
    the first requirement in the  sub-paragraph.   The  second  requirement
    alone would have been sufficient to give the Rule its effect.

15.   The passage in MacDonald suggests that "inability to care should  not
    be interpreted more strictly than in the exclusion undesirable  cases".
    That in turn refers to 'paragraph 11.79 et seq.'  Mr de Mello  did  not
    seek to argue that the Appellant should  succeed  because  of  such  an
    interpretation.   Indeed  the  evidence  does  not  suggest  that   the
    Appellant was living in poor conditions but rather that she is with the
    Sponsor's sister and is attending school in their village.  There is no
    suggestion that she is suffering any deprivations  or  living  in  poor
    conditions such as to justify an  argument  that  a  more  humanitarian
    approach to the definition of inability might be appropriate.

16.    There  is   a   significant   difference   between   inability   and
    unwillingness.  It takes a considerable amount of  imagination  to  see
    the two things as synonymous.  An inability is an involuntary situation
    whereas an unwillingness is voluntary.  Even if the decision in  Kauser
    is correct, the situation in that appeal could arguably be described as
    approaching an inability to care, whereas in this appeal it is not even
    arguable.

17.   We indicated our view that Mr de Mello could not  successfully  argue
    that the Appellant should succeed under sub-paragraph 9, and that being
    the case his appeal must fail.  We did not therefore feel it  necessary
    to resolve the more technical issue as to whether this adoption can  be
    said to have been  'in  accordance  with  the  decision  taken  by  the
    competent administrative authority or court in India'.

18.   Because the Appellant  cannot  comply  with  all  the  provisions  of
    paragraph  310  of  the  Immigration  Rules  HC  395,  the  appeal   on
    immigration grounds must be dismissed.

19.   Mr de Mello did not seek to argue that the  Appellant  could  succeed
    under Article 8 ECHR.  The appeal is dismissed.
