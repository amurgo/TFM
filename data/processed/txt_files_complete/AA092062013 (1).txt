Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr C Yeo, counsel instructed by Times Immigration
                    Consultants
For the Respondent:    Mr S Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by a citizen of Albania against the decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal dismissing her appeal against the decision  of  the
    respondent to return her to the country of which she is a national.  It
    is  her  case  that  she  is  a  refugee  or  otherwise   entitled   to
    international protection.  The core of her claim is  that  she  is  the
    victim of trafficking and, as is commonly the case for the  victims  of
    trafficking, in the event of her return to the country from  which  she
    was trafficked she  would  risk  the  indignity  and  horror  of  being
    trafficked again.

 2. The First-tier Tribunal Judge did  not  believe  her  and  the  grounds
    challenge the finding that she was not a truthful witness.

 3. Her application for permission  to  appeal  was  granted  by  an  Upper
    Tribunal Judge sitting in the First-tier and was  granted  even  though
    the application was made about a month late.  The judge  was  impressed
    with the grounds which are characterised by Mr Yeo, I think accurately,
    as "generally a reasons challenge". Such challenges are  sometimes  the
    most difficult ones with  which  we  have  to  deal  in  this  Tribunal
    because. I can see how the judge has reached the decision but  it  does
    not follow that the reasons are good enough in law.

 4. Mr Whitwell, for the Secretary of State,  has  made  several  perfectly
    sensible submissions tending to show that the applicant  has  not  been
    truthful but that is straying away a little from his primary task which
    is to assist me to determine if the reasons given in the  determination
    are sufficient in law.  Many of them are not regarded  as  particularly
    compelling, at least not by me, for example the appellant's lateness in
    pursuing her application for asylum, but they are undoubtedly  relevant
    points.

 5. However one reasons is particularly troubling and Mr  Yeo,  predictably
    and perfectly properly, made as much of it as he properly could.

 6. It is at paragraph 61 of the determination where the  judge  refers  to
    the appellant returning with another child.

 7. It is convenient to mention at this point that the  appellant  now  has
    two children, one of whom was born in Albania, and if  she  is  telling
    the truth that child was, like the appellant, threatened with  violence
    connected with her husband's failure to pay business debts.  The  other
    child, if the appellant is  telling  the  truth,  was  born  after  the
    appellant had entered in the United Kingdom  and  was  conceived  as  a
    result of the appellant being trafficked.

 8. Mr Yeo has pointed out, rightly, that the determination shows a  slight
    tendency to confuse these two grounds for concern in  this  appellant's
    life.  They are two quite different areas of concern and they  need  to
    be looked at quite distinctly. I was  invited  to  concentrate  on  the
    claim for asylum which is based on a fear of being trafficked.

 9. The judge said at paragraph 61 of the determination that:

         "The Appellant will return with another child, the father  of  whom
         she states she does not know.  That  child,  having  been  born  on
         2/11/2013, is unlikely to be the result of her claimed  work  as  a
         trafficked sex worker as she states she ran away  from  Arben  [the
         man that corrupted her] after a month  or  1  ï¿½  months  after  she
         arrived in the United Kingdom in mid-December 2012 [QU 2.1.SI]"

10. It is the appellant's case that this child was born as  the  result  of
    her being a sex worker and the chronology  was  used  as  a  reason  to
    disbelieve her.

11. Paragraph 61, read absolutely strictly, is, I  think,  correct.  It  is
    improbable on that scenario that the child was  born  during  the  time
    that the appellant was being trafficked as a sex worker.   The  problem
    is that on the appellant's chronology it is extremely close.  It  seems
    uncontroversial that the  child  was  born  on  2  November  2013  and,
    assuming as is well known, the human gestation period is  nine  months,
    the child must have been conceived at about the end of January  or  the
    beginning of February 2012. If the applicant had arrived in the  United
    Kingdom in the middle of December and escaped  after  one  and  a  half
    months she would have just finished her time as a sex worker before the
    end of January.  The difficulty is that  it  is  also  well-known  that
    babies rarely arrive in accordance with the strict timetable and  there
    is considerable margin for variation in the gestation  period.  Phrases
    such as "in the middle of December" and "a month  or  one  and  a  half
    months" are not necessarily precise. In the judge's findings  not  many
    allowances have to be made for it to  be  entirely  possible  that  the
    child was conceived during the time that the  mother  was  in  the  sex
    industry, and I find the rather sweeping way in which the judge  writes
    off that possibility in paragraph 61 to be concerning to the  point  of
    being wrong.  Had the finding been  hedged  in  with  some  caution  or
    reference to degrees of likelihood it might have been acceptable but  I
    think taken on its own it is saying too much on the available evidence.

12. When that is removed,  although  the  determination  in  many  ways  is
    cogent, there is nothing that stands out as a  clear  and  unequivocal,
    proper, sound, illuminating adverse credibility finding, and I  do  not
    know how much the judge's general approach to the case  was  influenced
    by what I find is a rather bad point. The  influence  could  have  been
    considerable.

13.  I  have  listened  carefully  to  Mr  Whitwell's  submissions  and   I
    acknowledge that there is a way  of  reading  the  determination  which
    leaves it untainted, but, having reflected on things as a whole,  I  am
    not satisfied that the judge has really given proper  reasons  for  the
    conclusion that he has. I allow the appeal and I set aside the decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal and I rule that the  case  must  be  decided
    again in the First-tier Tribunal when no findings can be preserved.

14. I must emphasis that this is not any kind of predictor of  the  outcome
    of the case.  It is certainly not a case that ought to  be  allowed  on
    what I have seen.  It is simply a case that I do  not  think  has  been
    decided properly and it needs to be decided again with an open mind.
