Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr I Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms R Thomas, Sponsor


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Entry Clearance Officer against a decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Elson MBE) which allowed the  claimant's
    appeal against a decision  dated  26  April  2013  refusing  him  entry
    clearance as the spouse of a  British  citizen  (Rachel  Thomas)  under
    Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules (HC 395 as amended).

 2. For convenience, I will refer to the parties hereafter as they appeared
    before the First-tier Tribunal.

Background

 3. The appellant is a citizen of Syria who was born on 30 April 1986.  The
    sponsor is a British citizen.  The appellant and  sponsor  met  on  the
    internet in 2011.  Their relationship developed and on  20  July  2012,
    the sponsor went to the Lebanon to meet the appellant.   They  remained
    together for five weeks and on 14 August 2012, they married in Lebanon.
    The sponsor returned to the UK  and  the  appellant  relocated  to  the
    United Arab Emirates.

 4. In February 2013, the appellant made an application for entry clearance
    to join his spouse in the UK under Appendix FM.  In a decision dated  2
    May  2013,  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  refused   the   appellant's
    application on three grounds.  First, he was  not  satisfied  that  the
    sponsor had established by the required evidence that she had  a  gross
    income of at least �18,600 per annum (see para E-ECP3.1).  Secondly, he
    was not satisfied that the appellant had provided satisfactory evidence
    of adequate accommodation (see E-ECP3.4).  Thirdly, the Entry Clearance
    Officer was not satisfied that the relationship between the sponsor and
    appellant was a genuine and subsisting one and that  they  intended  to
    live together permanently (see E-ECP2.6 and 2.10).

The First-tier Tribunal's Decision

 5. The appellant appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal.   Judge  Elson  MBE
    determined the appeal on  the  papers  as  no  oral  hearing  had  been
    requested.  The Judge found in the appellant's favour  on  two  of  the
    three issues raised by the Entry Clearance Officer.

 6. First, Judge Elson was satisfied that the appellant would be adequately
    accommodated in the UK on the basis of documentation submitted  by  the
    sponsor concerning her flat (see para 13).

 7. Secondly, the  judge  was  satisfied  on  the  basis  of  the  evidence
    submitted, including evidence of contact between the parties and a post-
    decision visit by the sponsor to be with her husband in the UEA from 18
    August 2013 to 11 September 2013, that their relationship  was  genuine
    and subsisting and that they intended to live together permanently.  At
    para 14 of his determination, Judge Elson said this:

         "The entry clearance officer does not dispute that the Sponsor  and
         the Appellant are married.  I accept the Sponsor's  explanation  as
         to the nature and length of her visits to the Sponsor, namely  that
         she has a job in the United  Kingdom.   It  is  apparent  that  she
         supports herself and has a flat which is subject to a mortgage  and
         that she has to meet her work commitments in the United Kingdom.  I
         accept that the Sponsor and the Appellant do enjoy  a  genuine  and
         subsisting relationship and I accept that it is their intention  to
         live together permanently as husband and wife."

 8. Finally, as regards the sponsor's employment, Judge Elson accepted that
    the sponsor's payslips indicated that her gross salary exceeded �18,600
    as required by  Appendix  FM  (see  para  13).   However,  he  was  not
    satisfied that the appellant had provided  the  required  documentation
    as, despite providing  the  relevant  payslips,  the  letter  from  the
    sponsor's employer had not been included with  the  documents  provided
    with the application (see para 15).  The judge  referred  to  a  letter
    dated 29 May 2013 which was before him but which, given its date, could
    not have been submitted with the application.  As a consequence,  Judge
    Elson concluded that the appellant had not established, by the required
    evidence, that he met the requirements of Appendix FM.

 9. Nevertheless, at para 16 Judge Elson allowed the appeal as not being in
    accordance with the law on the basis that the ECO had not  applied  the
    'evidential flexibility' policy to seek from the appellant the  missing
    documents.  At para 16, Judge Elson said this:

         "From the papers before me there is no indication  that  the  entry
         clearance offer pointed out  to  the  Appellant  that  he  had  not
         included certain documents with his application  or  gave  him  the
         opportunity to supply such missing documents  prior  to  the  entry
         clearance officer reaching his decision to refuse  the  application
         which he should have done  in  accordance  with  the  Secretary  of
         State's own evidential flexibility policy.  There  is  however  now
         with the papers (without any explanation as to how it  came  to  be
         there) the required employer's letter.  I conclude that  the  entry
         clearance officer did not therefore  act  in  accordance  with  the
         before mentioned policy so that  she  did  not  act  fairly  and  I
         conclude that her decision was not in accordance with the law."

The ECO's Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

10. The Entry Clearance Officer sought permission to appeal on  two  bases.
    First, the judge had erred in law in finding that the ECO had failed to
    apply the 'evidential flexibility' policy.   Secondly,  the  judge  had
    failed to give adequate reasons as to why the appellant and sponsor had
    a genuine  and  subsisting  marriage  and  intended  to  live  together
    permanently in the UK on the basis that the appellant and  sponsor  had
    failed to provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate they had  been  in
    regular contact.

11. On 12 February 2014, the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Levin) granted  the
    ECO permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on the  basis  that  the
    judge had been arguably wrong to end his determination by stating  that
    he allowed the appeal "under the Immigration Rules" given  his  finding
    in para 15 that the appellant could not meet the  requirements  of  the
    Rules.  In addition, the judge had been arguably  wrong  to  allow  the
    appeal on the basis that the ECO had failed to follow  the  'evidential
    flexibility' policy without identifying that policy.

12. At the hearing,  Mr  Richards  represented  the  ECO  and  the  sponsor
    appeared in person.

13. Mr Richards invited me to find that the  judge  had  erred  in  law  in
    applying the 'evidential flexibility' policy but, having considered the
    documents submitted by the appellant and sponsor both  in  relation  to
    the sponsor's income at the date of application and also  the  evidence
    of continuing contact  shown  in  photographs  and  Skype  records,  Mr
    Richards  accepted  that  the  appeal  should  be  allowed  under   the
    Immigration Rules.

Discussion

14. The two areas of dispute concern the sponsor's  employment  income  and
    the genuineness of their marriage.

15. As regards the former, the appellant submitted the  sponsor's  P60  for
    the tax year ending in April 2012  and  payslips  covering  the  period
    September 2012 to February 2013 which covers a six month period  up  to
    the date of application.  The bundle also contains a  letter  dated  15
    January 2013 from the sponsor's  employer,  Mini  Plant  Oxford,  which
    identifies the sponsor has having been employed since 2 April  2007  as
    an Assembly Associate which is a full-time and permanent position.  The
    sponsor's salary is identified as �25,176 per annum.  There is  also  a
    similar letter dated 29 May 2013 which was referred to by the judge  in
    his determination.  That, of course, could not have been submitted with
    the application as it postdates the ECO's  decision.   However,  it  is
    clear from the "Visa Application Submission Receipt" that the appellant
    submitted a "SPONSOR EMPL LTR"  which  must  mean  a  letter  from  the
    sponsor's employer.  The only letter that could refer  to  is  the  one
    dated 15 January 2013 which, for reasons unknown, did not find its  way
    from  the  ECO  to  the  judge.   It  was,  undoubtedly,  part  of  the
    appellant's submission  to  the  ECO.   In  addition,  there  are  bank
    statements from the Nationwide Building Society in the  sponsor's  name
    showing the payment in of her salary in the relevant period immediately
    preceding the appellant's application.

16. On this evidence,  as  Mr  Richards  acknowledged,  the  appellant  has
    established on a balance of probabilities on the basis of the specified
    evidence under Appendix FM-SE that he met the financial requirement  in
    E-ECP3.1  of  demonstrating  that  the  sponsor  (and   therefore   the
    appellant) has available a gross annual income of �18,600.

17. As I have indicated, Mr Richards did not seek to  disturb  the  judge's
    finding in para 14 that, on the basis of all the evidence  before  him,
    he was satisfied that the  parties'  relationship  was  a  genuine  and
    subsisting one and that they intended to live together  permanently  as
    husband and wife.  I have no doubt that that finding was properly  open
    to the judge and, on the basis of the evidence, I would make  the  same
    finding.  The judge had the sponsor's evidence as to the genuineness of
    their relationship.  There was evidence of continuing contact  both  in
    the form of photographs and Skype records and there was a post-marriage
    visit by the sponsor to see the appellant in the UEA between 18  August
    2013  and  11  September  2013.   The  judge  accepted  the   sponsor's
    explanation that it was her commitments in the UK which prevented  more
    frequent visits.  I am satisfied that the judge was entitled to make  a
    positive finding in the  appellant's  favour  on  the  genuineness  and
    subsistence of the marriage and  that  the  parties  intended  to  live
    together permanently.

18. The finding in  relation  to  the  adequacy  of  accommodation  is  not
    challenged and it has never been suggested that  the  appellant  cannot
    meet the other requirement of Appendix FM.

19. On the basis of the evidence, therefore, the judge was wrong in law  to
    conclude that the appellant did not meet the requirements  of  Appendix
    FM.  The appellant was entitled to entry clearance as  a  spouse  under
    Appendix FM.

20. For these reasons, the judge was wrong in law to allow the appeal  only
    on the limited basis that the decision of the ECO was not in accordance
    with the law.  Although, contrary to what is said  in  the  grounds  of
    appeal, there is an  evidential  flexibility  policy  applicable  under
    Appendix FM and it is set out at Appendix FM-SE para  D.   However,  on
    the evidence before the judge, the judge should have allowed the appeal
    under the Immigration Rules on the basis that  the  appellant  met  the
    substance of the Rules.

Decision

21. For these reasons, the First-tier  Tribunal's  decision  to  allow  the
    appeal as not being in accordance with the law involved the  making  of
    an error of law and that decision is set aside.

22. I remake  the  decision  allowing  the  appellant's  appeal  under  the
    Immigration  Rules  on  the  basis  that  the   appellant   meets   the
    requirements of Appendix FM for entry clearance as a spouse.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

The appellant has succeeded under the Immigration Rules largely on the
basis of the material which was before the Entry Clearance Officer.  In
those circumstances, I make a whole fee award against the Respondent.
