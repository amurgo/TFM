                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of the Entry Clearance Officer against the  decision
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Asjad promulgated 19.1.15, allowing  under
    both the Immigration Rules and article 8 ECHR,  the  claimant's  appeal
    against the decision of the Entry Clearance Officer to refuse him entry
    clearance to the United Kingdom as an adult  dependent  relative  under
    section E-ECDR of Appendix FM of  the  Immigration  Rules.   The  Judge
    heard the appeal on 8.1.15.

 2. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Holmes  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    2.3.15.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 17.4.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. For the reasons set out below I find that there was such error  of  law
    in the making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal such that  the
    determination of Judge Asjad should be set aside and remade.

 5. The first test under E-ECDR 2.4 is that the claimant  must  demonstrate
    that as a result of age, illness or disability, he  requires  long-term
    personal care to perform everyday tasks.

 6. Judge Asjad allowed the appeal, finding that because of the  claimant's
    age he requires long-term help from another person with cooking. At �22
    of the decision the was satisfied on the balance of probabilities  that
    this had been  proved.  However,  the  judge  failed  to  consider  the
    specified evidence requirements under Appendix FM-SE and  I  find,  for
    the reasons set out that the claimant failed to provide  the  necessary
    evidence.

 7. At �22 of the decision Judge Asjad also answered the test in E-ECDR 2.5
    in the claimant's favour, the test being  that  the  claimant  must  be
    unable, even with the practical and financial help of the  sponsor,  to
    obtain the required level of care in India, because it is not available
    and there is no person in that country who can reasonably  provide  it.
    Again,  the  judge  failed   to   consider   the   specified   evidence
    requirements.

 8. If the judge was satisfied that the Immigration Rules  were  met  there
    was no purpose in going on to consider article 8 ECHR, and  the  appeal
    did not need to be additionally allowed  on  that  basis.  However,  no
    error of law arises from considering article 8, though for the  reasons
    set out I find that the conclusion was flawed and cannot stand.

 9. The grounds  rightly  complain  that  Judge  Asjad's  approach  to  the
    requirements of section E-ECDR was misconceived and flawed for  failure
    to consider that the claimant has  family  in  India,  including  adult
    grandchildren, cousins and in-laws to whom he could turn  for  support.
    Additionally, he could relocate to a home closer to his  daughters,  so
    that they could support him and provide his meals. The fact that  there
    may be cultural reasons why his  daughters  (incorrectly  described  as
    sisters in �14 of the decision) were unwilling  to  provide  assistance
    does not meet the test that  there  is  no  person  in  India  who  can
    reasonably provide the necessary care. Further, as Judge  Holmes  noted
    in granting permission, it is absurd to suggest that amongst  the  vast
    population of India there was no one suitably qualified to provide  the
    required level of care. The sponsor's evidence was  that  the  claimant
    relied on the services of a maid, who cooked and cleaned for  him,  but
    it was said that this was erratic and on the days  the  maid  does  not
    come he has to ask someone else  to  get  him  something  to  eat.  The
    claimant's statement to the Entry Clearance Officer was that  the  maid
    came for 3 hours on a daily basis. At �18 the judge  concluded  that  a
    maid  could  not  reasonably  provide  the  required  level  of   care,
    suggesting that the claimant and the sponsor had demonstrated that this
    was not a viable option. At �19 the judge found that for  the  majority
    of the time the required help is not available. The sponsor  said  that
    it was difficult to get a maid in a rural area,  but  no  consideration
    had apparently been made to relocating the  claimant  to  somewhere  he
    could access the necessary level of support. I find  that  the  judge's
    assessment of the evidence was inadequate and he failed to address  the
    real issues in the case.

10. Further, the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  failed  to  have  regard  to
    paragraphs 33-37  of  Appendix  FM-SE  as  to  the  specified  evidence
    required to demonstrate that the claimant meets both  limbs  of  E-ECDR
    2.4 and 2.5.

11. Evidence that the claimant requires long-term personal care as a result
    of age, illness or disability, should  take  the  form  of  independent
    medical evidence that his physical or mental condition  means  that  he
    cannot perform everyday tasks; and this must be from a doctor or  other
    health professional. At �10 the judge referred to a letter from Dr  AVG
    Reddy, dated 18.4.14, which recommends "physical and moral  support  to
    get on with his day to day activities," following bilateral total  knee
    replacement surgery. Whilst the notes also say that  his  appetite  was
    poor, it is also noted that this  improved  gradually  with  treatment.
    None of this evidence constitutes independent medical evidence that  he
    cannot perform everyday tasks because of age, illness or disability. In
    the circumstances, the claimant failed to meet the first test  of  2.4,
    regardless of the judge's views as to the limited evidence of Dr  Reddy
    and the oral evidence of the sponsor.

12. By paragraph 35 of FM-SE, there also has  to  be  independent  evidence
    that the claimant is unable, even with the practical and financial help
    of the sponsor in the UK, to obtain  the  required  level  of  care  in
    India, and that this evidence must be from a central  or  local  health
    authority; a local authority; or a doctor or other health professional.
    No such  evidence  was  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  in  the
    circumstances, the claimant's application was doomed to failure and the
    appeal could not succeed on immigration grounds, regardless of  what  I
    find was a flawed assessment of the available evidence as to the use of
    a maid having been tried and tested.

13. Further, paragraph 36 provides that if the claimant's required care has
    previously been provided though a  private  arrangement,  the  claimant
    must provide details of that  arrangement  and  why  it  is  no  longer
    available. Paragraph 37 also requires that  if  financial  support  has
    been provided by the sponsor or other  close  family  in  the  UK,  the
    claimant must provide an explanation as to why this cannot continue  or
    is no longer sufficient to enable the required level of care.

14. The grounds complain that there was no evidence as to what efforts  had
    been made to secure alternative reliable domestic assistance. It cannot
    be the case that only one unreliable maid is  available,  even  if  the
    claimant is in a rural community.  The  sponsor  asserts  that  he  can
    finance care in the UK for 20-25 hours a week  from  their  comfortable
    income; thus he can provide more than one maid and even live  in  help.
    There has been no credible explanation why such finances could  not  be
    deployed in providing additional care for the claimant, or helping  him
    move to somewhere where such care is more readily available.  It  makes
    no sense at all to move the claimant all the way to the UK just because
    there is an erratic maid in his rural community. I  find  that  obvious
    questions were left unanswered in the evidence adduced on behalf of the
    claimant. For example, how many sources had been  contacted;  how  many
    maids employed previously; what has been done to address  the  concerns
    about the erratic level of care. The Entry Clearance Officer noted that
    general, domestic and even specialised domestic care  is  available  at
    affordable cost in India, especially if funded by someone  abroad.  The
    claimant also has friends and neighbours who apparently assisted him to
    travel to Chennai to make  his  application.  The  claimant  failed  to
    demonstrate that he could not, with the sponsor's financial assistance,
    pay for further assistance to  include  the  cooking  or  provision  of
    meals. Further, as stated, it was also open to the claimant to relocate
    to somewhere where he could access such assistance.  It  is  absurd  to
    suggest that it is reasonable in these circumstances to expect  the  UK
    to shoulder at public expense the burden of the claimant's care when he
    could, for example, relocate to be near his daughters or  other  family
    members, or a larger town or city  where  domestic  help  may  be  more
    readily available. As the Entry Clearance Manager review suggested, the
    claimant has failed to demonstrate that  this  application  is  one  of
    necessity rather than choice and convenience. In that regard I note the
    grounds of appeal state that it is the claimant's last wish of his life
    to spend his remaining life with the sponsor. In  his  remarks  to  the
    Tribunal the sponsor urged on me the moral responsibility  he  had  for
    his father the claimant  and  his  concern  about  the  level  of  care
    available to him.

15. None of  the  above  considerations  were  properly  addressed  in  the
    decision, rendering the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  flawed,
    irrational, and in error of law.

16. The article 8 assessment is also flawed for want of adequate reasoning,
    setting out in just 6 lines the judge's conclusion  that  the  claimant
    has family life with his son in the UK, although they have lived  apart
    by choice for many years. In such circumstances,  if  any  family  life
    exists between them,  it  cannot  to  render  the  refusal  decision  a
    sufficiently grave interference so as to engage article 8 at all.

17. Even if article 8 was engaged, there was no consideration of the public
    interest and in particular section 117B that immigration control is  in
    the public interest, or the  absence  of  evidence  that  the  claimant
    speaks English, or whether he would be  financially  independent  or  a
    burden on the state, at least in respect of health care  and  treatment
    in the UK.

18. The decision of the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  merely  maintained  the
    status quo. There is no positive duty on the Entry Clearance Officer to
    admit the claimant if he does not meet the Rules. The decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal makes no proportionality assessment  and  takes  no
    account of the public interest in maintaining immigration control,  the
    likely cost to the public purse, or of the opportunity for the claimant
    to make a further application, ensuring that  the  evidence  meets  the
    requirements of the Rules. Article 8 is not a short cut  to  compliance
    with the Rules. On the basis of the judge's assessment  of  article  8,
    every relative of every settled person in the UK would be  entitled  to
    entry on the same grounds, just because they are related to each other.



19. In the circumstances, the decision was in error of  law,  cannot  stand
    and must be set aside and remade.

20. In remaking the decision I take account of those matters set out above.
    I find for the same reasons set out that the  claimant  has  failed  to
    demonstrate by specified evidence that he meets either 2.4 or 2.5 of E-
    ECDR. I find it a strange proposition  that  just  because  a  maid  is
    erratic in attendance at the claimant's home to  cook  his  meals,  the
    claimant should be uprooted from  India  to  come  and  live  with  the
    sponsor in the UK. The claimant has failed to demonstrate that even  if
    he does require long-term personal care because of his age,  that  such
    care is not available elsewhere. For obvious reasons the threshold test
    under  E-ECDR  is  very  high,  requiring  independent  evidence,   but
    providing protect for those with provable need of support to carry  out
    everyday tasks and where that level of support cannot  be  provided  in
    their own country. The  frustrations  with  the  erratic  maid  or  the
    sponsor's understandable care and concern for his father in his old age
    do not meet the strict requirements.

21. In relation to the article 8 claim, whilst I accept  that  there  is  a
    family relationship between father and son, it is a situation of  long-
    standing whereby the sponsor has chosen to remain in the  UK  far  away
    from his father. That  family  life  is  not  such  as  to  engage  the
    protection of article 8 outside the FM and section  E-ECDR  Rules.  The
    decision of the Entry Clearance Officer does not amount to  such  grave
    interference with the claimant's rights. Even  if  article  8  ECHR  is
    engaged, taking into account the public interest considerations set out
    above from section 117B and bearing in mind that there is a  route  for
    entry for those who meet the strict requirements,  and  in  respect  of
    which the claimant has failed to prove, it remaining  open  to  him  to
    make a further application addressing those  strict  requirements,  the
    balances come firmly down in favour of the  Entry  Clearance  Officer's
    decision. It was not disproportionate.

Conclusions:

22. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

                    I re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing it on
                    all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
