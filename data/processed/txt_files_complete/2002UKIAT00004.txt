                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This determination is made pursuant to  Rules  23  and  30  (1)  of  the
    Immigration and Asylum Appeals (Procedure) Rules 2000.

 2. The appellant,  who  is  a  citizen  of  Jamaica,  appeals  against  the
    determination of an Adjudicator, Andrew Jordan, who dismissed the appeal
    of the appellant for non-appearance.

 3. The grounds of appeal were referred to when leave to appeal was granted.
     It is apparent that the appellant was  unable  to  attend  the  hearing
    because of problems with her former solicitors.  As a result the correct
    forms were not lodged.  In the circumstances the  Tribunal  has  decided
    after giving all parties the opportunity to make representations on  the
    issue and taking into account the provisions of Rule 20 of the Procedure
    Rules above referred to, to remit this  appeal  for  a  re-hearing.   No
    objection  has  been  made  to  the  proposed  course.   The  appeal  is
    accordingly allowed to the extent that it is remitted to be heard afresh
    by an Adjudicator other than Andrew Jordan.



                                                               Mr A R Mackey
                                                              Vice President
