                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

 1. The history of this matter is  as  follows.   The  Appellants  are  all
    nationals of  Somalia  resident  in  Syria.   They  applied  for  entry
    clearance to join the  first  Appellant's  husband  and  the  remaining
    dependants' father, a British citizen but were refused  on  28th  March
    2012 on the grounds that the Entry Clearance Officer was not  satisfied
    that the principal Appellant was married to someone present and settled
    in the UK, that the marriage was subsisting, that she was  exempt  from
    the  English  language  requirement  or  that   the   maintenance   and
    accommodation requirements of the Rules could be met.

 2. The Appellants appealed to an Immigration Judge and, on 9th April  2013
    the appeal was dismissed.  The judge was satisfied that the couple were
    related as claimed and that the marriage was subsisting.

 3. So far as the finances were concerned  the  Sponsor's  average  monthly
    salary was �1,160.77 and, if the family joined him, there would  be  an
    entitlement to �309.11 per week of  working  family  tax  credit  which
    constituted  recourse  to  public  funds.   The  Sponsor  had  produced
    evidence that a 3 to 4-bedroom property would be available to rent  but
    he was  not  in  a  financial  position  to  afford  a  greater  rental
    commitment.

 4. He made no findings in respect of the absence of  an  English  language
    test certificate and concluded that there would be  no  breach  of  the
    UK's obligations under the ECHR by the refusal.

 5.  The  Appellants  appealed  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  and  was  granted
    permission but, on 5th September 2013 Deputy  Judge  Dearden  found  no
    error of law in the determination.

 6. The Appellants then sought permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal.
     On 15th October 2014 the court, having considered the joint  statement
    of reasons, was satisfied that there were good and  sufficient  reasons
    to allow the appeal without determining the merits,  and  approved  the
    remittal of the matter insofar as it concerns  the  third,  fourth  and
    fifth Appellants who are minor children.

 7. The determination of the Upper Tribunal was quashed and the Appellants'
    appeal remitted to a freshly-constituted panel of  the  Upper  Tribunal
    for a de novo hearing on Article 8 of the ECHR 1950.

The facts of this case

 8. There are no longer any credibility issues. The family left Somalia  in
    2003. The Appellants went to Syria and the Sponsor came to the  UK  and
    claimed asylum.  He was refused in 2005 but granted indefinite leave to
    remain under the legacy programme following a fresh claim in 2010.   He
    is now a British citizen.

 9. The Sponsor works  but  is  unable  to  earn  sufficient  to  meet  the
    maintenance and accommodation requirements of the Rules.

10. Communication  with  the  family  is  extremely  difficult.   There  is
    substantial evidence of money being sent to them and  the  Sponsor  has
    made efforts to visit,  but  obviously  that  has  become  increasingly
    difficult.  He went to Syria in  September  2011,  before  the  present
    conflict started, in order to try to secure  their  exit  and  he  last
    visited them at the end of 2013 returning in January 2014. He  was  not
    able to do so before because of his own lack of status.

11. It is not possible to get a visa as a British citizen  to  enter  Syria
    and the Sponsor had great difficulty entering  on  the  last  occasion,
    finally managing to do so via Lebanon.

12. The principal Appellant  is  diabetic  and  one  of  the  children  has
    gastrointestinal problems for which he needs "surgical  reconstruction"
    according to the medical report provided by Dr Emad Alyamani.

13. The Sponsor's main concern however is for the  family's  safety.   They
    live in Barzeh suburb next to Douma which is right in the centre of the
    conflict zone.   They  have  no  heating  and  have  only  four  hours'
    electricity every day because of the shelling.  His daughter cannot  go
    to school because of the threat of rape.

14. The Foreign Office advice as at the date of decision  was  against  all
    travel to Syria.  British nationals in Syria were  urged  to  leave  by
    whatever practical means.  Those who choose to remain in Syria or visit
    against the very strong and clear advice not to should  be  aware  that
    the Embassy was not able to  provide  consular  services  nor  able  to
    assist with evacuation from the country.

15. The Foreign Office states:

         "Fighting has triggered  the  temporary  suspension  of  commercial
         flights, caused road  closures,  serious  impeded  access  to  land
         border crossing points and  led  to  the  closure  of  some  border
         crossings."

16. It may not be possible to guarantee security  along  the  routes.   All
    border crossings and routes should be checked before  travel  and  some
    are in the hands of opposition groups and vulnerable to  attack.   That
    advice remains.

17. There is widespread fighting in Damascus and its suburbs  and  military
    operations  have  resulted  in  a  significant  number  of  deaths  and
    injuries.  According to the Human Rights Watch Report of November  2012
    cluster bombs have killed children in a town near Damascus.   The  ICRC
    Report for July 2012 states that humanitarian needs are growing  there,
    where various neighbourhoods have been cut  off  from  each  other  and
    people are trapped in the midst of the fighting.   Many  buildings  are
    reduced to rubble.

18. The Respondent's position, rather  unenthusiastically  advanced  by  Mr
    Diwnycz, is that family life could continue as it has before  with  the
    Appellants remaining in Syria.

The Law

19. Mundeba (Section 55 and paragraph 297(1F)) [2013] UKUT 00088 (IAC)  was
    concerned with paragraph 297(1)(f) which requires entry clearance to be
    issued  where  there  are  "serious  and  compelling  family  or  other
    considerations which make exclusion of the child undesirable."

20. The President of the Tribunal held that

         "Where an immigration decision engages Article 8 rights, due regard
         must be had to the UN Convention on the Rights of  the  Child.   An
         entry clearance decision for the admission of a child under  18  is
         'an action concerning children... undertaken  by...  administrative
         authorities' and so by Article 3 the best interests  of  the  child
         shall be a primary  consideration.   Although  the  statutory  duty
         under Section 55 of  the  UK  Borders  Act  2009  only  applies  to
         children within the UK, the broader duty doubtless explains why the
         Secretary of  State's  IDI  invites  Entry  Clearance  Officers  to
         consider the statutory guidance under Section 55."

21. The relevant IDIs in respect of that Rule, dated  July  2011  state  as
    follows:

         "(1) Serious and compelling family or other considerations.

              Section 55 of the Borders,  Citizenship  and  Immigration  Act
             2009 requires the UK Border Agency to carry out  its  existing
             functions in a  way  that  takes  into  account  the  need  to
             safeguard and promote the welfare of children in the  UK.   It
             does  not  impose  any  new  functions  or  override  existing
             functions.

               Officers  must  not  apply  the  actions  set  out  in   this
             instruction either to  children  or  to  those  with  children
             without having due regard to Section 55.  The UK Border Agency
             instruction arrangements to safeguard and  promote  children's
             welfare in the UK Border Agency sets out the key principles to
             take into account in all agency activities:

                    . Our statutory duty to children includes the  need  to
                      demonstrate:

                    . Fair treatment which meets the  same  standard  as  a
                      British child would receive;

                    . The child's interest being a primary although not the
                      only consideration;

                    . No discrimination of any kind;

                    . Asylum  applications  are  dealt  with  in  a  timely
                      fashion;

                    . Identification of those that might be  at  risk  from
                      harm."

22. The IDI goes on to state that it is not the intention of the Rules that
    a child should be admitted because of the wishes of other relatives  in
    the UK, and the Tribunal emphasised that cases where it was simply  the
    wishes of the party to be together, however natural that ambition might
    be, should be excluded.

23. So far as Article 8 was concerned, the President wrote as follows:

         "Where Article 8 is relied on the secure the admission of  a  child
         to reside with a relative who has never previously cared  for  him,
         whether the case is examined from the perspective of  the  positive
         obligation to respect family  life  or  the  negative  one  not  to
         interfere with it save for justified and proportionate  reasons  of
         public interest, we doubt that Article 8 adds significantly to  the
         basic criteria of the Family Admissions Rules."

24. The comment that Article 8 adds little to the Family  Admissions  Rules
    is interesting. It implies that the requirement for there to be serious
    and  compelling  considerations  is  relevant  to   the   question   of
    proportionality.

25. So far as that particular Appellant was concerned he said:

         "Again we emphasise the Appellant is not being denied reunion  with
         a previous carer or needs admission in  order  to  supply  a  basic
         unmet need of his.  The material advantages of life in  the  UK  is
         not the test; the loss of his cultural  roots  in  the  society  in
         which he has grown up to date is a relevant factor.   There  is  no
         evidence that he is at risk of harm where he is."

26. It can be seen therefore that both in  the  IDIs  in  relation  to  the
    admission of children and in the comments of the Tribunal  in  Mundeba,
    unsurprisingly there is strong emphasis on whether the children are  at
    risk of harm.

Consideration of Article 8

27. This family have not lived together for many years,  but  no  issue  is
    taken with the existence of family life between the Sponsor,  his  wife
    and children at present. Nor with the duty to look to  the  future  and
    the development of family ties, and not only  in  the  present  heavily
    restricted context.

28. This is not a case such as Mundeba where the Appellant and Sponsor  had
    never lived together.  This family were  united  until  2003  when  the
    decision was made, because of the circumstances prevailing  in  Somalia
    at that time, for them to leave and to separate.

29. The refusal is a clear interference with the right to  enjoy  a  family
    life.  No meaningful family life  can  be  conducted  in  circumstances
    where communication is so difficult.

30. The decision is however lawful since the Appellants  do  not  meet  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules and in pursuit  of  a  legitimate
    aim, not only the maintenance of  immigration  control  but  the  clear
    economic disbenefit to the UK by this  family's  arrival.  There  would
    manifestly be recourse to public funds.

31. In assessing the proportionality of the decision I am required to  take
    into account the factors listed in 117B of the  Immigration  Act  2014,
    all of which argue in favour of the Respondent.

32. The Appellants do not meet the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules.
    The Sponsor speaks excellent English and he said that his children  had
    had some education in English and I have no doubt that the logistics of
    attending a test centre in Damascus are impossible.  Nevertheless there
    is no demonstration that the family can speak English  and  accordingly
    paragraph 117B(2) should be considered as weighing against them.

33. More significantly is the requirement in 117(3) i.e it is in the public
    interest that persons who seek  to  enter  or  remain  in  the  UK  are
    financially independent.  The cost to the public purse of  this  family
    entering, at least in the short term, is considerable.  I fully  accept
    that the Sponsor is a hardworking individual who has done his  best  at
    all times to make a positive economic contribution to the UK but he  is
    simply unable to earn what is considered to be an adequate wage.

34. In AAO v ECO [2011] EWCA Civ 840 the Court of Appeal said:

         "A  requirement  that  an  entrant  should  be  maintained  without
         recourse to public  funds  is  an  ultimately  fair  and  necessary
         limitation on what would otherwise become a  possibly  overwhelming
         burden on all of its citizens.  It is  an  unfortunate  reality  of
         life that states especially one like  the  UK  which  is  generally
         accessible  and  welcoming  to  refugees  and   immigrants   cannot
         undertake to allow all members of a family to  join  together  here
         even those members who can show emotional and financial  dependency
         without creating unsupportable burdens."

35. Moreover in MS [2013] CSOH1 Lord Brody stated that  a  case  which  had
    succeeded on Article 8 grounds, having failed in terms  of  the  Rules,
    would be described as exceptional even though a failure to comply  with
    the Immigration Rules remained the  starting  point  of  an  Article  8
    enquiry and not its conclusion.

36. On the other hand, if entry clearance refusal is maintained  there  can
    be no family life at all for these Appellants with the  Sponsor.   This
    is not a case where family can be continued elsewhere either  in  Syria
    itself or in another country.  The refusal means an absolute severance.



37. The Sponsor is not able to travel to Syria,  not  only  because  it  is
    dangerous for British citizens to go there but also because  he  cannot
    practically  get  there.  He  was  fortunate  in  persuading  a  Syrian
    Immigration Officer on the Lebanese border to allow him in  last  time,
    but there is no guarantee at all that he will be able to do so again in
    the future.

38. Moreover it is not at all clear, in the present context of the  war  in
    Syria, whether it would even be possible for the  Appellants  to  leave
    and relocate back to Somalia.  The Sponsor's unchallenged  evidence  is
    that his wife has tried to leave Syria several times and he sent  2,000
    dollars to her which she paid to an agent to try to get her  to  Turkey
    or to Lebanon but both attempts ended in failure due to heavy  fighting
    along the way to the border.

39. The best interests of the children are  a  primary  consideration,  not
    because Section 55 applies to them, but because of the  broader  duties
    under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child,  reflected  in  the
    guidance to Entry Clearance Officers that the child's interests  are  a
    primary although not the only consideration.

40. The most relevant aspect of the guidance is clearly the  identification
    of those that might be at risk from harm.

41. No issue is taken with the objective evidence on Syria and Damascus  in
    particular.  The Foreign Office advice is  entirely  clear.   There  is
    widespread fighting throughout Syria.   The  continuing  violence,  the
    deteriorating security situation and Syria's  chemical  and  biological
    weapons programme creates a volatile situation.

42. I take full account of the Respondent's interests.  I bear in mind that
    the Immigration Rules are compliant with human rights  legislation  and
    that the Appellants cannot meet them.  On the other  hand  the  Sponsor
    has no real capacity  to  enjoy  any  kind  of  family  life  with  the
    Appellants in Syria or they with him.  The best interests in this  case
    are absolutely clearly in favour of entry to the UK.  On any  view  the
    situation in Syria is highly dangerous in the context of  a  civil  war
    which has decimated the country.

43. In  this  case  there  are  significant  justified  reasons  of  public
    interest.  However, given the  real  risks  which  these  children  are
    experiencing simply as a consequence of living where they do, and their
    inability to remove themselves from a place of danger I  conclude  that
    the refusal of entry clearance to enable them  to  join  their  British
    father in the UK is a disproportionate interference with their right to
    enjoy family life with him and he with them.

Notice of Decision

44. The Appellants' appeals are allowed on human rights grounds.



No anonymity direction is made.
