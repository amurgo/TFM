Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr A Bandegani, Counsel, instructed by Sultan Lloyd
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr G Saunders, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a citizen of Vietnam  born  on  19  August  1995.   He
    appeals against the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Pirotta
    dismissing his appeal against the decision of the  respondent  refusing
    to grant him asylum in the United Kingdom.

2.   He claimed to have left Vietnam when he was 16 years old.  The  journey
    to the UK  took  him  approximately  one  year.   He  was  arrested  in
    Lincolnshire on 16 November 2012 after medics were called to  him  when
    he was observed having an anxiety attack.  He made an asylum  claim  on
    22 November 2012 which was refused on 7  August  2013.   He  lodged  an
    appeal on 24 July 2013.

3.   On 22 January 2013 the appellant was referred to the National  Referral
    Mechanism (NRM) for Potential Victims  of  Trafficking  (PVOT).   In  a
    letter dated 14 February 2013 wrote to the appellant  saying  that  the
    Competent Authority has carefully considered the circumstances  of  the
    appellant's case and concluded that there  are  reasonable  grounds  to
    believe that he  has  been  trafficked.   The  respondent  granted  the
    appellant 45 days' temporary admission from the date  of  their  letter
    "to help him recover from his trafficking experience and to  allow  him
    time to consider what you wanted to do next.".  The letter went on  say
    that at the end of the reflection period, the Competent Authority would
    make a "conclusive" decision as to whether the appellant was  a  victim
    of trafficking.   Following  this  decision  the  UKBA  would  consider
    whether a residence permit was appropriate and he would be notified  of
    the decision on his case.  On 12 April  2013  the  Competent  Authority
    decided  that  there  were  conclusive  grounds  to  believe  that  the
    appellant had not been the victim of trafficking.

4.   On 12 July 2013 the respondent issued a Notice of Immigration  Decision
    refusing the appellant's claim for asylum and/or human rights  for  the
    reasons set out  in  the  refusal  letter  dated  10  July  2013.   The
    respondent accepted that the appellant was a national of Vietnam,  that
    his father was dead as a result of a land dispute.  The respondent  did
    not accept the rest of the appellant's account.

5.   The respondent  identified  the  basis  of  the  appellant's  claim  as
    follows: his fear of return to Vietnam is that he  will  be  forced  to
    work for the people who  he  previously  worked  for  in  Vietnam.   In
    addition, he feared that he would be homeless, as he had no  family  in
    Vietnam.  The respondent considered that the appellant's claim did  not
    meet the definition of the 1951  Refugee  Convention,  and  his  asylum
    claim was refused in its entirety.

6.   The judge heard oral evidence from the  appellant  gave  oral  evidence
    and did not believe his account of  events  in  Vietnam.   The  judge's
    reasons for her findings are  set  out  at  paragraphs  47  to  61  and
    repeated at paragraphs 62 to 66.


7.    The  judge  considered  the  medical  report  from  Dr.  Lesley   Lord
    concerning the  appellant's  scarring  which,  she  said,  recited  the
    instructions he had given the solicitors and Dr. Lord said some of  the
    scars were consistent with the appellant's account.  Of  the  scars  on
    his arms, he said he could not remember one but the other  was  from  a
    knife.  Dr. Lord did not give any opinion  about  possible  alternative
    causes.  Dr. Lord said  the  appellant  told  her  that  he  could  not
    remember how he obtained the scar  consistent  with  stitching  on  the
    wound to the back of his left hand.  The judge found  at  paragraph  48
    that the appellant's scarring report shows that  his  explanations  for
    the scars were inconsistent.  He could not ascribe many of them to  the
    force labour he said he had to perform or to being punished for  trying
    to escape.  The judge found at paragraph 53 that  other  injuries  were
    consistent with being beaten, which is not uncommon in Vietnam  for  no
    apparent reason as society is  violent  to  those  who  cannot  protect
    themselves.

8.   The judge did not accept the appellant's account that the gang  masters
    would have provided free passage for him to  the  UK  in  exchange  for
    working for two years or that he would be  smuggled  across  the  world
    alone in a container.  The objective evidence showed that the costs  of
    being smuggled to Western Europe from Vietnam could be  about  �17,000-
    �20,000.  It is not credible that the appellant would have been able to
    earn sufficient in two years unpaid labour moving boxes in  the  jungle
    to entitle him to a free passage to the UK with smugglers.

9.   The judge was not satisfied that the appellant was put on the lorry  as
    part of a trafficking exercise for exploitation as his account was that
    he was permitted to leave the lorry having reached the UK  and  allowed
    to go off on his own.  His account of when and who told  him  that  his
    mother was in the UK was inconsistent and not credible.   She  was  not
    satisfied that he was brought to the UK as a reward for working for the
    gang master or that he was smuggled in for the purpose of forced labour
    in the UK or other types of exploitation because he was allowed  to  go
    free and has never been contacted by any of  the  persons  involved  in
    bringing him here.

10.  The judge was not satisfied that he was  rendered  homeless  after  the
    death of his father or that he was forced to beg on the  streets.   The
    judge found that it was not credible  that  the  appellant  would  have
    recognised the name of Dong Quang where he had begged by looking on the
    internet as he had said that there were no place names in the villages.

11.  The original  grounds  argued  among  other  things  that  it  was  the
    appellant's  submission  that  his  journey  to  the  UK  was  entirely
    indicative of having been trafficked  and  that  the  judge  failed  to
    consider this possibility, which goes to the core of his asylum  claim.
    Permission was however granted to the appellant  to  argue  only  three
    issues and they were (1) the judge's finding that the  appellant  could
    not have lived on the streets for 4  years  without  being  taken  into
    forced labour.  The judge's finding was  not  based  on  any  objective
    evidence.  (2) The judge was unaware that  the  place  name  i.e.  Dong
    Quang, related to a market place rather than a  town.   The  judge  who
    granted permission said of the other grounds that they  were  of  less,
    immediately identifiable, arguable merit. (3)  The judge had  erred  in
    her handling of the appeal.  She had asked  too  many  questions  which
    were confusing.  This was  based  on  an  email  from  the  appellant's
    support worker who was present at the hearing.  Counsel did not rely on
    this ground or on the ground that judge  failed  to  properly  consider
    that Dong Quang is the name of a market in Thai Nguyen

12.  Counsel relied on his skeleton argument which  recast  the  appellant's
    grounds of appeal in the following terms:  the  judge  failed  to  have
    proper regard to the scarring report. She  failed  to  have  regard  to
    country material and adopted a wrong approach to the evidence.

13.  I raised with the parties that  the  judge  had  not  made  a  specific
    finding as to whether the  appellant  was  trafficked  to  the  UK.   I
    noticed particularly that  this  issue  was  not  raised  in  Counsel's
    skeleton argument.

14.  Counsel submitted that the approach to the appellant's appeal  must  be
    to determine whether  the  judge's  findings  are  sustainable  on  the
    evidence and then to assess what risks, if any, he faces on  return  to
    Vietnam.  The appellant's whole case was that to return him to  Vietnam
    would amount to a breach of Article 3 and Article 4 of the ECHR.  If he
    has suffered in the past then the material  fact  is  that  he  is  the
    victim of former trafficking  and  that  gives  rise  to  a  Convention
    reason.  I agreed with Counsel's approach.

15.  Counsel argued that the  judge  reached  unsustainable  findings.   Her
    treatment of the Convention reason was cursory.  Because  she  did  not
    accept the appellant's account, she concluded that he was not a  member
    of the particular social group.

16.  On the issue of the scars, Counsel submitted that the face of  it,  the
    judge appears to have given reasons to depart from the findings of  Dr.
    Lord.  However, she did not reach her findings at paragraphs 48 and  53
    on the basis of the evidence.  He argued that in total, nine out of the
    ten scarring sites identified by Dr Lord are said to be "diagnostic" of
    the claimed cause and one is highly consistent. Even if it was open  to
    the judge to characterise violence in Vietnam as  being  meted  out  to
    vulnerable people "for no apparent reason", that failed  to  appreciate
    that  according  to  the  Istanbul  protocol  "diagnostic"  means   the
    "appearance could not have been caused  in  any  way  other  than  that
    described".  Of the ten scars, seven were attributed by  the  appellant
    to mistreatment. There was no rational  or  evidential  basis  for  the
    conclusion at paragraph 48 that his explanations  for  the  scars  were
    inconsistent.  The judge was incorrect to say that he could not ascribe
    many of the scars to the forced labour.

17.  I find that the judge made  sustainable  findings  in  respect  of  the
    appellant's scars.  The judge at paragraph 53 was entitled to  find  on
    the evidence that the appellant gave an  inconsistent  account  of  the
    stitching of the injury on the back of his left hand.  Whilst I  accept
    that Dr. Lord described some of the scars  as  diagnostic,  there  were
    many scars for which the appellant had no explanation as  to  how  they
    were caused. In the circumstances I do not accept the argument that the
    judge's finding at paragraph 48 was unsustainable. He ascribed some  of
    the scars to being beaten and told Dr. Lord that he did  not  know  how
    they were caused. In the circumstances the judge's finding at paragraph
    53 was open to her.

18.  Counsel argued that the  judge  failed  to  determine  the  appellant's
    account of street begging  for  years  as  a  child  in  the  round  by
    reference to country material in support of  the  appellant's  account.
    The judge had found at paragraph 47 that the appellant's  evidence  was
    not consistent with the level of begging known to take place in Vietnam
    or the taking of street children  into  forced  labour.  The  objective
    country evidence shows that there is  little  record  of  abduction  or
    forced labour of orphans, whereas many children are  sold  into  bonded
    labour by their families, particularly in poor rural areas, such as the
    place the appellant lived with his father.   Counsel  argued  that  the
    judge's finding was unsustainable because the objective evidence  shows
    that children beg on the streets in Vietnam.

19.  I find that the judge's finding at paragraph 47 has to be seen  in  the
    context of the appellant's evidence  that  he  was  taken  into  forced
    labour after about 4 years of begging in the streets.  In that  context
    I find that the judge's finding was open to her in  the  light  of  the
    objective evidence that she relied on.

20.  Counsel also took issue with the judge's finding that  the  appellant's
    evidence was inconsistent in relation to whether the appellant had said
    he went to the hospital, and who told him his mother was in the UK.  In
    this regard, Counsel submitted that the judge should not have relied on
    the appellant's evidence in the age assessment and, in any  event,  the
    appellant clarified his evidence in his statement.

21.  I was not persuaded by Counsel's argument because as part  of  the  age
    assessment, evidence would have been obtained from the appellant as his
    past history and circumstances.  Consequently, there was nothing in the
    information in the age assessment that could arguably  be  said  to  be
    inadmissible.  It was part of his case and it was open to the judge  to
    consider it. In any event  the  workers  relied  on  that  evidence  to
    believe the appellant's age.  The judge did not err in looking at  that
    evidence.

22.  I agree with Mr Saunders' submission  that  even  at  its  highest,  if
    everything the appellant said was true and was accepted, he was a small
    boy who fell into the hands of people who forced him  to  work  in  the
    jungle.  They caused him to be brought here and then  were  content  to
    let him go.  They did not force him to work in a  cannabis  factory  in
    the UK.  If he is a member of  a  particular  social  group,  there  is
    nothing about him which distinguishes him as  a  person  who  has  been
    forced into servitude, shifting boxes in the jungle.  In any event, the
    appellant is now an adult.   The  circumstances  he  found  himself  in
    Vietnam are not likely to reoccur and it is not even  likely  that  his
    slave masters would have any idea that he was back in Vietnam.

23.  I find that on the  evidence  that  was  before  the  judge,  she  made
    findings that were open to  her.   Her  findings  are  sustainable  and
    disclose no error of law.

24.  The judge's decision dismissing the appellant's appeal shall stand.
