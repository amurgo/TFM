                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms R Stickler, Counsel instructed by N.C. Brother &
Co Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr L Tarlow Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Ghani promulgated  on  26  June  2014  dismissing  the  appeal  of  the
    Appellant, Mr Tirtha Bahadur Pun, against  the  decision  of  an  Entry
    Clearance Officer in New Delhi dated 20 September  2013  to  refuse  to
    grant entry clearance to settle as  the  adult  dependent  son  of  his
    father, Mr Dil Bahadur Pun.




 2. The Appellant is a national of Nepal born on 15  September  1988.   His
    father is a former member of the  British  Army's  Brigade  of  Gurkhas
    having served for just over fifteen years from November 1974 and  being
    discharged with  the  highest  categorisation  of  military  service  -
    'exemplary'.  The Appellant's father was granted  indefinite  leave  to
    remain in the United Kingdom in January 2007  and  is  thereby  settled
    here.




 3. The instant application to join his father is not the Appellant's first
    such application.  An earlier application had been made  in  July  2009
    and refused on 12 January 2010.  An appeal against that decision was in
    due course withdrawn by the  Appellant.   The  Appellant's  mother  and
    sister, however, were both granted entry clearance: the sister  arrived
    in October 2010 and the mother arrived in April 2011.  It is said  that
    the decision to withdraw the Appellant's appeal at that time was  based
    on poor legal advice.  Since that time the Appellant remained in Nepal,
    living in his father's house, and  was  financially  supported  by  his
    father whilst he continued studies.




 4. On 26 July 2013 the Appellant applied again for entry clearance to join
    his father in the United Kingdom.  The application was  refused  on  20
    September 2013 for reasons set out in a Notice of Immigration  Decision
    of that date with reference to paragraph EC-DR.1.1 of Appendix  FM  and
    in particular E-ECDR2.4,  also  with  reference  to  the  Secretary  of
    State's policy for dependants  over  the  age  of  18  of  Foreign  and
    Commonwealth and other HM Forces members as described in  IDI,  Chapter
    15, section 2A.  Reference was also made in the decision to  Article  8
    of the European Convention on Human Rights.




 5. The Appellant appealed to the  Immigration  and  Asylum  Chamber.   The
    appeal was dismissed for the reasons set out in the First-tier Tribunal
    Judge's Decision and Reasons.



 6. Before Judge Ghani it was accepted on behalf of the Appellant  that  he
    did not meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules,  and  that  the
    relevant policy had been applied by  the  Respondent's  decision-maker:
    see the determination of Judge Ghani  at  paragraph  13.   Accordingly,
    before the  First-tier  Tribunal,  the  Appellant  placed  reliance  on
    Article 8.

 7. At paragraph 13 of the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  the  Judge
    directed  herself  to  relevant  case  law  including  Razgar,  and  at
    paragraph 14 she made reference to the cases of Kugathas and S v United
    Kingdom in the following terms:

         "The first question therefore  is  whether  or  not  the  Appellant
         enjoys private or as the case may be family life  with  his  father
         and mother.  In the case of Kugathas [2003] EWCA Civ  31  Arden  LJ
         said "there is no presumption of family  life,  in  my  judgment  a
         family  life  is  not  established  between  adult  child  and  his
         surviving parent or other siblings  unless  something  more  exists
         than normal ties".  In the case of S v  United  Kingdom  [1984]  40
         DR196 it was stated "generally the protection of family life  under
         Article 8 involves cohabiting dependants such as parents and  their
         children,  minor   children.    Whether   it   extends   to   other
         relationships depends on the circumstances of the particular  case.
         Relationship between adults, a mother and her 33 year  old  son  in
         the present case, would not necessary  acquire  the  protection  of
         Article 8 of the Convention without evidence of further elements of
         dependency involving more than normal emotional ties"."

    We note there the reference to the  'circumstances  of  the  particular
    case'.  This emphasises that the issue  under  Article  8(1)  is  fact-
    sensitive, which is also very  much  the  emphasis  in  the  review  of
    jurisprudence in the case of Ghising (family life  -  adults  -  Gurkha
    policy) [2012] UKUT 00160 (IAC) to which we will return in due  course.
    (Hereafter to avoid confusion with another case with a similar title we
    shall refer to this case as Ghising [2012].)



 8. The Judge then said this at paragraph 15:

         "I accept that the Appellant has throughout his life been dependent
         financially on his father.  I also find that this is a norm as  far
         as the Appellant's culture is concerned.  The Appellant is now over
         the age of 25 and is currently a student studying  Management.   He
         suffers from asthma but this is a long standing condition which has
         been managed with medication.  The appellant did  make  a  previous
         application which was refused in 2010 and the appeal withdrawn.  At
         that time he was aged  21.   The  Appellant's  father  was  granted
         indefinite leave to remain on 15 January 2007.  His mother  arrived
         in the UK on 19 April 2011 and his sister came  to  the  UK  on  29
         October 2010.  The Appellant's father stated in his  evidence  that
         if and when the Appellant falls ill, his aunt  would  come  to  his
         assistance.  Furthermore, the Appellant  lives  with  a  tenant  in
         family home.  The aunt only  lives  about  25  minutes  away.   The
         Appellant's father accepted that he went back to Nepal in 2008  but
         this was only because his father passed away.  If  his  father  had
         not passed away he would not have visited.  The Appellant's  mother
         has  not  returned  to  Nepal  since  her  arrival.   Despite   the
         Appellant's evidence  that  they  are  extremely  worried  for  the
         Appellant's well-being and  that  he  is  alone  etc.,  I  find  it
         somewhat incredible that both parents have not chosen to visit  the
         Appellant.  There cannot be said to be any meaningful  relationship
         between the Appellant and his  parents  other  than  the  Appellant
         being their son and they being culturally  bound  to  maintain  him
         financially.  The Appellant has shown over a substantial period  of
         time that he can manage  fully  without  his  parents  despite  his
         medical condition.  His medical condition cannot be said to  be  an
         exceptional factor.  I therefore find that Article 8 is not engaged
         in the Appellant's case."




 9. The Judge  went  on  to  consider  at  paragraphs  16  and  17  in  the
    alternative the issue of proportionality.  In the event we  have  found
    it unnecessary for us to consider that aspect of the Judge's reasoning.
     Had it been necessary for us so to do, undoubtedly we would have  been
    influenced  by  the  decision  in  Ghising  and  Others  (Gurkhas/BOCs:
    historic wrong; weight) [2013] UKUT 00567 (IAC)  -  (hereafter  Ghising
    [2013]).




10. The Appellant having lost his appeal against  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal which  was  initially
    refused by the First-tier but was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Eshun
    on 18 November 2014.



11. The Respondent has filed a Rule 24 Notice resisting the appeal dated 24
    November 2014.



12. Before us the focus of the Appellant's challenge to the decision of the
    First-tier Tribunal is, as  inevitably  it  must  be,  on  the  judge's
    finding that Article 8 is not engaged - that in other  words  the  case
    fell at the first of the Razgar questions.




13. The Appellant's grounds in support of the application for permission to
    appeal which have been adopted and expanded upon by Ms Stickler  before
    us today essentially raise three bases of challenge.




14. The first  ground  of  challenge  is  that  in  assessing  whether  the
    relationship between the Appellant and his father went beyond the usual
    emotional ties, the  Judge  failed  to  have  any  regard  to  what  is
    described as 'Gurkha specific  considerations'  (Grounds  at  paragraph
    4(i)), and in particular the  historic  injustice  suffered  by  Gurkha
    veterans as identified in the case of Ghising [2013].




15. The second ground of challenge contends that the Judge erred in law  in
    failing to consider the Appellant had not  established  an  independent
    life when considering the  question  of  family  life  as  between  the
    Appellant and his father.





16. The third basis of challenge is again heavily reliant upon the decision
    in Ghising [2013] to the effect that had there been family life between
    the Appellant and his father it would have  ordinarily  resulted  in  a
    favourable outcome on an application for entry clearance  such  as  the
    Appellant had made.




17. We consider that the first ground of  challenge  is  misconceived.   We
    have drawn to the attention of the Appellant's representative the  case
    of JB (India) [2009] EWCA Civ 234.  In that case the historic injustice
    was in the context of British overseas citizens.  At paragraphs 20  and
    21 of the judgment of Lord Justice Sullivan the following is said:

         "20. Counsel for the appellants laid great stress on the historical
             wrong which had deprived the sponsor of a right  of  abode  in
             the United Kingdom by legislation which had been acknowledged
             to be racially discriminatory and then  further  discriminated
             against her on account of her sex because married women  could
             not apply for vouchers under the special quota voucher  scheme
             unless their husbands were incapacitated. The history  of  the
             special quota  voucher  scheme  and  its  application  to  the
             sponsor and her family is  set  out  in  some  detail  in  the
             reconsideration determination and it is unnecessary to  repeat
             it in this judgment. The decisions in NH and RO are  authority
             for the proposition that, where there is an interference  with
             family life sufficient to  engage  Article 8(1),  recognition
             that the family has been the victim of a 'historic  injustice'
             may well be relevant, in some cases highly relevant, when  the
             proportionality  of  that  interference  is  considered  under
             Article 8(2), but, as the Tribunal said on reconsideration in
             the present case: 'first it must be shown that there is family
             life for the purposes of Article 8, and that the  interference
             with it (or lack of respect for it) is sufficiently serious to
             engage the potential operation of Article 8'.
         21.  The historic injustice has no bearing on the question whether,
             in 2007, these three adult appellants and  their  mother  were
             not simply members of the same family but were  enjoying  what
             could sensibly be described as family life for the purposes of
             Article 8. There is no  reason  to  doubt  Immigration Judge
             Parker's conclusion that in 1992,  when  the  appellants  were
             aged 19, 17 and 10, and were living with their mother in India
             they were dependent upon her at  that  time  even  though  the
             eldest appellant was just an adult. But, as with all families,
             circumstances changed as the children  grew  older.  By  2007,
             when the relevant application for entry  clearance  was  made,
             the appellants were 33, 31 and 24 years  old.  They  had  been
             separated from their mother since 2001 and,  as  the  tribunal
             said on reconsideration, it was clear that the appellants  did
             not need their mother to be with them."
    We pause to add that the references to the  cases  of  NH  and  RO  are
    references to Entry Clearance Officer Mumbai v NH (India)  [2007]  EWCA
    Civ 1330 and RO (India) v Entry Clearance Officer [2008] EWCA Civ 1525.



18. Whilst it may well be the case that factual distinctions can  be  drawn
    between the circumstances of  the  appellant  in  JB  (India)  and  the
    circumstances of the Appellant in the case before  us,  that  does  not
    detract from the central point made at paragraph 21 that the  "historic
    injustice" has no bearing on the question of family life as  it  exists
    at the relevant date of the decision.




19. The second basis of challenge brought on behalf of the Appellant really
    comes down to the question of whether the Judge's analysis at paragraph
    15, and conclusion that there no longer existed family life as  between
    the Appellant and his parents, was  adequate  against  the  established
    jurisprudence.



20. In this context we note that the Judge had regard to two authorities at
    paragraph 14 to which we have already made reference.  We have also had
    consideration to the  exploration  of  the  jurisprudence  set  out  in
    Ghising [2012] which was itself approved and endorsed by the  Court  of
    Appeal in Gurung and Others [2013] EWCA Civ 8 at paragraph 46.  In this
    context we have noted in particular paragraphs 50-62 of the decision in
    Ghising [2012]:

        "50. The ECtHR has established that, from birth, a child has a bond
        with his parents which amounts to "family life", which  remains  in
        existence despite  voluntary  separation  (see  Sen  v  Netherlands
        (2003) 36 EHRR 7; (1996) Gul v Switzerland 22 EHRR 93).

        51. The question which arises in this case is at  what  stage  does
        the child/parent bond of family life come to an end?  When does  an
        adult child cease to enjoy family life with his  parents,  for  the
        purposes of Article 8?

        52. The authority most frequently cited on this point is Kugathas v
        Secretary of State for the Home Department [2003] EWCA Civ 31.   We
        observe at the outset that the facts in  Kugathas  were  strikingly
        different from the facts in this case.  Mr Kugathas was a  national
        of Sri Lanka, aged about 38, who had  moved  to  Germany  with  his
        mother and siblings, as  refugees,  about  17  years  earlier.   Mr
        Kugathas had been living on his own in the UK for  about  3  years,
        and the only contact he had had with his family was one visit of  3
        weeks duration from his sister, her husband and child, and periodic
        telephone calls.  The Court of Appeal held that he  did  not  enjoy
        family life with his family  in  Germany,  within  the  meaning  of
        Article 8(1).

        53. In Kugathas,  at  [14],  Sedley  LJ  cited  with  approval  the
        Commission's observation in S v United Kingdom (1984) 40 DR 196:

             "Generally the protection  of  family  life  under  Article  8
             involves cohabiting dependents,  such  as  parents  and  their
             dependent,  minor  children.  Whether  it  extends  to   other
             relationships depends on the circumstances of  the  particular
             case. Relationships between adults, a mother and her  33  year
             old son in the present case, would not necessarily acquire the
             protection of Article 8 of the Convention without evidence  of
             further elements of dependency, involving more than the normal
             emotional ties."

        54. Sedley LJ accepted the submission  that  'dependency'  was  not
        limited to economic dependency, at [17].  He added:

             "But if dependency is read down as meaning  "support"  in  the
             personal sense,  and  if  one  adds,  echoing  the  Strasbourg
             jurisprudence, "real" or "committed"  or  "effective"  to  the
             word "support", then it represents in my view the  irreducible
             minimum of what family life implies."

       55. Arden LJ said , at [24] - [25]:

             "24. There is no presumption that a person has a family  life,
             even with the members of  a  person's  immediate  family.  The
             court has to scrutinise the  relevant  factors.  Such  factors
             include  identifying  who  are  the  near  relatives  of   the
             appellant, the nature  of  the  links  between  them  and  the
             appellant, the age of the appellant, where and  with  whom  he
             has resided in the past, and  the  forms  of  contact  he  has
             maintained with the other members of the family with  whom  he
             claims to have a family life.

             25.  Because there is no presumption of  family  life,  in  my
             judgment a family life is not  established  between  an  adult
             child and  his  surviving  parent  or  other  siblings  unless
             something more exists than normal emotional ties...  Such  tie
             might exist if the appellant were dependent on his  family  or
             vice versa."




       56. We accepted the Appellant's submission  that  the  judgments  in
           Kugathas  had been interpreted too restrictively in the past and
           ought to be read in the light of  subsequent  decisions  of  the
           domestic and Strasbourg courts.

       57. It has been recognised that family  life  may  continue  between
           parent and child even after the child has attained his majority:
           see Etti-Adegbola v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department
           [2009] EWCA Civ 1319, per Pill LJ at [23]; per Arden LJ at [35].



       58. In Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  v  HK  (Turkey)
           [2010] EWCA Civ 583, the Court of Appeal (which included  Sedley
           LJ in its constitution) considered the judgments in Kugathas and
           Sir Scott Baker said, at [16]:

             "In my judgment Mr Sachdeva is seeking to read more into these
             passages than  is  warranted  ...  it  is  apparent  that  the
             respondent had lived in the same house as  his  parents  since
             1994. He reached his majority in September 2005 but  continued
             to live at home. Undoubtedly he had family life while  he  was
             growing up and I would not regard it as suddenly cut off  when
             he reached his majority."

       59. In RP (Zimbabwe) & Anor  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
           Department [2008] EWCA Civ 825, [6]  Sedley LJ said it would  be
           'unreal' to dispute that  the  23  year  old  appellant  enjoyed
           family life with her parents when she  "had  lived  pretty  well
           continuously with her parents and siblings all her  life".   The
           Court of Appeal also found the  second  appellant,  who  was  25
           years old, enjoyed family life with his  parents  since  he  was
           "economically and emotionally  ..  a  member  of  his  immediate
           family, all of whom - that is his parents and his two sisters  -
           are now lawfully resident here" (at [8]).

       60. Academic commentators on Strasbourg judgments have observed that
           the Commission has been  more  cautious  in  its  acceptance  of
           family life between parents and adult children than  the  Court:
           Clayton & Tomlinson: The Law of Human  Rights   2nd  ed.  (2009)
           paragraph 13.143 -144; Liddy: The concept of family  life  under
           the  ECHR  European  Human  Rights  Law  Review  1998,1,  15-25.
           Certainly, some of the Court's decisions  indicate  that  family
           life between adult children and parents will readily  be  found,
           without evidence of exceptional dependence. For example:

              a. Boughanemi v France (1996) 22 EHRR 228. The ECtHR held that
                 the deportation of a 34 year old man  was  an  interference
                 with his family life with his parents and siblings although
                 he no longer lived with them.

              b. Bouchelkia v France (1998) 25 EHRR 686. The ECtHR held that
                 a deportation order interfered with the family life of a 20
                 year old man living with his parents and siblings.

              c. Kaya v Germany (Application no 31753/02).  The  ECtHR  held
                 that a young adult who had lived with his parents until  he
                 was sent to prison in 1999 still enjoyed family  life  with
                 them on his deportation in 2001, as he had  kept  in  touch
                 with his family through visits and letters.

       61. Recently, the ECtHR has reviewed the case law, in  AA  v  United
           Kingdom (Application no 8000/08),  finding  that  a  significant
           factor will be whether or not the  adult  child  has  founded  a
           family of his own.  If he is still single and  living  with  his
           parents, he is likely to enjoy family life with them.  The Court
           said, at [46] - [49]:

             "46. The Court recalls that in Bouchelkia v France, 29 January
             1997, � 41 Reports of  Judgments  and  Decisions   1997,  when
             considering whether there was an interference with  Article  8
             rights in a deportation case,  it  found  that  "family  life"
             existed in respect of an applicant who was 20  years  old  and
             living with his mother, step-father and siblings. In  Boujlifa
             v France, 21 October 1997, � 36, Reports  1997-VI,  the  Court
             considered that there was "family  life"  where  an  applicant
             aged 28 when deportation proceedings  were  commenced  against
             him had arrived in France at the age of five and received  his
             schooling  there,  had  lived  there  continuously  with   the
             exception of a period of imprisonment in Switzerland and where
             his parents and siblings lived in  France,  In  Maslov,  cited
             above, � 62, the Court recalled, in the case of  an  applicant
             who had reached the age of majority by the time the  exclusion
             order became final but was living with his  parents,  that  it
             had accepted in  a  number  of  cases  that  the  relationship
             between young adults who had not founded a family of their own
             and  their  parents  or  other  close  family   members   also
             constituted "family life".

             47. However, in two recent cases against  the  United  Kingdom
             the Court has declined to find "family life" between an  adult
             child and his parents. Thus in  Onur  v  United  Kingdom,  no.
             27319/07, � 43-45, 17 February 2009,the Court noted  that  the
             applicant, aged around  29  years  old  at  the  time  of  his
             deportation, had not demonstrated  the  additional  amount  of
             dependence  normally  required  to  establish  "family   life"
             between adult parents and  adult  children.  In  A.W.  Khan  v
             United Kingdom, no. 47486/06, � 32, 12 January 2010. the Court
             reiterated the need for additional elements of  dependence  in
             order to establish  family  life  between  parents  and  adult
             children and found that the 34 year old applicant in that case
             did not have "family  life"  with  his  mother  and  siblings,
             notwithstanding the fact that he was living with them and that
             they suffered a variety of different health problems.   It  is
             noteworthy, however, that  both  applicants  had  a  child  or
             children  of  their  own  following  relationships   of   some
             duration.

             48.  Most recently, in Bousarra, cited  above,  �  38-39,  the
             Court  found  "family  life"  to  be  established  in  a  case
             concerning a 24 year old applicant, noting that the  applicant
             was single and had no children and recalling that in the  case
             of young adults who had not yet founded  their  own  families,
             their ties with their parents and other close  family  members
             could constitute "family life".

             49.  An examination of the  Court's  case-law  would  tend  to
             suggest that the applicant, a young adult of 24 years old, who
             resides with his mother and has not yet founded  a  family  of
             his own can be regarded as having "family life". "

       62. The different  outcomes  in  cases  with  superficially  similar
           features emphasises to us that the issue under Article  8(1)  is
           highly fact-sensitive.  In our judgment, rather than applying  a
           blanket rule with regard to adult children, each case should  be
           analysed on its own facts, to decide whether or not family  life
           exists,  within  the  meaning  of  Article  8(1).  As  Wall   LJ
           explained, in the context of family life between adult siblings:



             "We do not think that Advic is authority for  the  proposition
             that Article 8 of the Human Rights  Convention  can  never  be
             engaged when the family life it is sought to establish is that
             between adult siblings living together. In our  judgment,  the
             recognition in Advic that,  whilst  some  generalisations  are
             possible, each case is fact-sensitive places an obligation  on
             both Adjudicators and the IAT to identify the  nature  of  the
             family life  asserted,  and  to  explain,  quite  shortly  and
             succinctly, why it is that Article 8 is or is not engaged in a
             given case."  (Senthuran v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
             Department [2004] EWCA Civ 950)."


  21. We consider that the First-tier Tribunal Judge  did  exactly  what  is
      suggested in the final passage above at paragraph 15 of her  decision.
      In our judgment this does  indeed  constitute  a  short  and  succinct
      explanation of why Article 8 was considered  on  the  very  particular
      facts of this case not to be engaged.




  22. We have in reaching this decision also had regard to  the  submissions
      made with reference to  the  decision  in  Pun  and  Others  (Gurkhas:
      policy: Article  8)  Nepal  [2011]  UKUT  00377  (IAC).   Ms  Stickler
      directed our attention in particular to what was said in that decision
      about financial dependency at paragraph 24.  Paragraph 24 is in  these
      terms:

         "The need for an evaluation of the facts of  each  particular  case
         seems to us to provide the answer to Mr Blundell's submission  that
         when assessing article 8 any  financial  dependence  should  be  of
         necessity not choice by analogy with a similar requirement  to  the
         assessment of dependency under the Rules. Even if such an  approach
         is required under the Rules, and it does seem to us that  this  may
         be an over-simplification of what the court was saying in Bibi,  it
         would  be  wrong  to  impose  such  a  limitation  when   assessing
         dependency within article 8. Each case must be looked at on its own
         facts. We certainly accept that a contrived dependency  will  carry
         little, if any,  weight  within  article  8  either  when  deciding
         whether family life exists or when assessing  proportionality,  but
         if financial  dependency  is  of  choice  to  the  extent  that  an
         applicant is dependent so that he or she can pursue further studies
         this should not without more mean that  such  a  dependency  cannot
         properly be taken into account."




23. It seems to us that the passages there cited offer further guidance  as
    to the approach to be taken in such cases as the current case but again
    emphasise the need for a case-by-case approach.   We  do  not  consider
    that there is anything declarative or imperative in paragraph 24 of Pun
    that obliged the Judge to  conclude  in  this  particular  appeal  that
    because the Appellant was still being supported by  his  father  family
    life existed.  In our judgment the  Judge  gave  adequate  reasons  for
    explaining why he did not consider that to be the case, notwithstanding
    the fact of the financial dependence which the  Judge  clearly  had  in
    mind.  In  those  circumstances  we  find  that  there  is  nothing  of
    substance in the challenge to the  judge's  conclusion  in  respect  of
    Article 8(1).




24.  The final ground of challenge is premised on the existence  of  family
    life and has no determinative value in isolation.  Having rejected  the
    first two grounds we find that the third ground  is  therefore  without
    foundation.



25. Accordingly, in all of the circumstances, we find that the  Judge  made
    no material error of law.  The  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    stands and Mr Pun's appeal is dismissed.






Deputy Judge of the Upper Tribunal I. A. Lewis   Dated: 6 January 2015
