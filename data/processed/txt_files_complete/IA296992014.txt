                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Perry promulgated on 26 January 2016.  Permission to appeal was granted
    by First-tier Tribunal Judge PJM Hollingworth on 28 July 2016.



Anonymity

 2. No direction has been made previously, and there is no reason  for  one
    now

Background

 3. The appellant arrived in the United Kingdom with leave to  enter  as  a
    Tier 4 migrant on 15 December 2012, valid until 24 May 2014. On 13  May
    2014 she applied for leave to remain as a partner on a  "10-year  route
    to settlement," according to the box ticked on her application form  as
    well as the covering letter. Within  that  application,  the  appellant
    explained that she married her British citizen partner  in  the  United
    Kingdom and that he earned ï¿½2,892 per month after  deductions.  In  the
    covering letter, it was also explained that the appellant was  of  good
    character. A substantial quantity of supporting evidence  was  enclosed
    with the application, mainly regarding the financial  position  of  the
    appellant's partner.

 4. The Secretary of  State  refused  the  application  on  10  July  2014,
    concluding, essentially, that while the appellant  had  a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship with her British partner who had lived  in  the
    United Kingdom all his life, this did not mean that they were unable to
    live together in Ghana. The respondent stated that she had not seen any
    evidence to  suggest  that  there  were  any  insurmountable  obstacles
    preventing  them  from  continuing   their   relationship   in   Ghana.
    Accordingly, the appellant was unable to fulfil EX.1(b) of Appendix  FM
    to the Rules  and  therefore  did  not  meet  the  requirements  of  R-
    LTRP.1.1(d).

 5. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal. In her grounds,  she
    argued that the respondent's decision was disproportionate and  not  in
    accordance with the Rules. She questioned  the  reason  why  she  would
    return to Africa simply to apply for entry clearance and  be  separated
    from her partner and family for an indeterminate period.

The hearing before the First-tier Tribunal

 6. The appellant and her partner gave evidence at  a  hearing  which  took
    place on 4  April  2015.   The  judge  concluded  that  there  were  no
    insurmountable obstacles to the couple continuing their relationship in
    Ghana and that the appellant's removal would not be disproportionate on
    the basis that her partner unreasonably refused to join her in Ghana.

The grounds of appeal

 7. The grounds of appeal were drafted by the appellant.  The thrust of her
    argument  was  that  the  judge  had  not  fully  considered  all   the
    circumstances of the case and emphasis was placed on the delay  in  the
    judge deciding the appeal.

 8. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis that it was arguable that
    the judge erred by conflating the hardship test with the insurmountable
    obstacles test; that the judge should have assessed whether or not very
    significant difficulties existed which could not be overcome.

 9. The grant of permission considered it arguable that the judge  did  not
    state whether he found that very compelling  circumstances  existed  to
    enable him to proceed to consider whether there would be  a  breach  of
    Article 8; the extent of reasoning in this  context  was  insufficient;
    that the judge should have set out a fuller analysis in relation to the
    unreasonable refusal on the part of the appellant's to  join  his  wife
    set against the background of findings  of  fact  in  relation  to  his
    financial position and he should have applied the criteria pursuant  to
    section 117 of the 2002 Act in considering whether  there  would  be  a
    breach of Article 8.

10. The Secretary of State's response of 25 August 2016 indicated that  the
    appeal was opposed. It was argued that the grant of permission bore  no
    resemblance to any of the grounds pleaded and the points taken were not
    Robinson obvious.  The grant of permission, in relation to the test for
    insurmountable obstacles, was said to be misconceived. In terms of  the
    statutory  considerations,  the  appellant  could  derive  no  positive
    benefit to remain in this country in terms of her  financial  resources
    or fluency in English. Were an error of law to be found, the respondent
    observed that it may become necessary for the appellant to show why  it
    would be disproportionate to expect her to return to Ghana to  make  an
    entry clearance application under appendix FM as opposed to asking  for
    preferential treatment outside the Rules.

The error of law hearing

11. The respondent correctly noted that the grant of permission bore little
    relationship to the grounds and further, correctly, questioned  whether
    the issues identified in the grant of permission were obvious points.

12. The appellant attended the hearing with her husband, but unrepresented.
    I identified three areas of concern based on the grounds of appeal  and
    facts of the appellant's case. Firstly, there was a delay of  9  months
    between the hearing of the appeal and  promulgation  of  the  decision;
    secondly, the judge  did  not  address  the  appellant's  reference  to
    Chikwamba v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2008]  UKHL  40
    (25 June 2008) in her evidence to the First-tier Tribunal  and  thirdly
    all the indications were that the appellant  met  the  requirements  of
    Appendix FM in relation to the 5-year  route  to  settlement  and  this
    ought to have been a consideration in the judge's assessment of Article
    8 outside the Rules.

13. The appellant told me that she sought advice from a lawyer as to how to
    apply for further leave to remain as a partner and took  that  lawyer's
    advice. She did not know why the 10-year route to settlement  had  been
    chosen. In this regard, Ms Ahmad argued that a Home  Office  caseworker
    is only obliged to consider the application made. With  regard  to  the
    delay, Ms Ahmad agreed that a  delay  in  excess  of  3  months  raised
    questions regarding the judge's fact-finding  however,  she  considered
    that he did refer to all the evidence. The appellant told me  that  the
    respondent's representative at the appeal  had  said  that  she  should
    return to Ghana and apply for entry from there. She  had  replied  that
    she did not wish to do so because of the uncertainty as to the time  it
    would take, because her husband was a contractor  who  could  not  take
    much time away and they were trying to start a family.

Decision on error of law

  14. I announced that the FTTJ made material errors of law and set aside
      his decision in its entirety. My reasons are as follows.

15. Judge Hollingworth did not refuse permission on any  ground  raised  by
    the appellant. The appellant commented as to why it took  so  long  for
    her and her partner to receive a "response" following the hearing.  The
    hearing took place on 14 April 2015, whereas the decision  and  reasons
    was promulgated on 26 January 2016. There has therefore been a delay of
    9 months between the two events. I  have  considered  the  judgment  in
    Secretary of State for the Home Department v RK (Algeria)  [2007]  EWCA
    Civ 868, particularly at where the following was said;

         "Another factor which usually  figures  prominently  in  a  court's
         consideration of the effect of delay upon the  safety  of  a  lower
         court's or  tribunal's  decision  is  that  there  were  issues  of
         credibility for the court or tribunal to consider; and that, in the
         long passage of time until preparation of the decision, the court's
         or the tribunal's memory of the often subtle features  relevant  to
         an assessment of credibility may well have dimmed."

16. In this case, the appellant complains that the judge did not take  into
    account aspects of her case, most notably, her reasons for not  wishing
    to return to Ghana temporarily  for  the  purpose  of  obtaining  entry
    clearance. An examination of the decision in question shows that at [24-
    28] the judge recorded the appellant's evidence and that of her husband
    on this and other matters. I considered whether this was a  case  where
    the judge's decision was vitiated on account of the delay  between  the
    hearing date and promulgation. Credibility was not  in  issue  in  this
    appeal, yet at [40] the judge  found  that  the  husband  "unreasonably
    refused to join his wife in Ghana."  The  basis  for  this  finding  is
    unclear  and  I  conclude  that  it  is  possible  that   the   judge's
    recollection of a witness might have been  adversely  affected  by  the
    delay in this case. This error alone would not have led to the decision
    of the judge being set aside.

17. Another ground of appeal related to the  appellant's  unwillingness  to
    return to  Ghana  in  order  to  seek  entry  clearance  owing  to  the
    "uncertainty of separation" and its effect on her plan  to  conceive  a
    child with her husband. This was a matter  raised  in  the  grounds  of
    appeal to the First-tier Tribunal and which was the subject of evidence
    and argument at the hearing before the judge. Yet, the  judge  made  no
    findings on whether it was reasonable to expect the appellant to return
    to Ghana for the purpose of seeking re-entry as a partner.  This  error
    is  material,  given  the  indication  that  the  appellant   met   the
    requirements of the Rules under the 5-year route and had applied  under
    the 10-year route solely owing to poor legal advice rather than because
    she could not meet the more stringent requirements of the 5-year route.

18. The judge noted at [31] that the appellant's application was considered
    under  the  "partner  route"  and  that  she  needed  "to  meet   three
    requirements. The  first  requirement  is  that  EX.1  applies  to  her
    application." The judge erred  in  reaching  this  finding,  given  the
    quantity of evidence provided to the respondent  with  the  application
    which indicated that the requirements of the Rules relating to  the  5-
    year route were met. The requirements to be met were, in the  following
    order, suitability, eligibility, relationship,  financial  and  English
    language requirements. The judge ought to have firstly enquired why the
    appellant was resorting to the 10-year route, if only to identify  what
    aspect of the Rules for partners she was  unable  to  meet.  While  the
    respondent considered the application with which she was presented, the
    appropriateness of the  10-year  route  in  the  appellant's  case  was
    relevant to the judge's  findings  on  Article  8  outside  the  Rules,
    including the Chikwamba point.



Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error of on a point of law.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside, in its entirety.

The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal, de novo, to be  heard  at
Taylor House with a time estimate of 2 hours (not before Judge Perry).

The respondent is directed to reconsider the appellant's  application  under
the 5-year route to settlement, seeking further evidence from the  appellant
if necessary and to do so within the next 28 days
