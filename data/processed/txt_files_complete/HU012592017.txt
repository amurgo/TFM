Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr R Wilcox of Counsel, J M Wilson
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, HOPO


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant has been granted permission to  appeal  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Watson  dismissing  her  appeal  against  the
    refusal of the respondent to grant her leave to  remain  on  Article  8
    human rights grounds.

2.   The appellant is a citizen of Jamaica born on 17 March 1970.  She  came
    to the UK as a visitor in 2002.  She has been living with Omar  [T]  as
    an unmarried partner.  Mr [T] has  a  British  child  from  a  previous
    relationship  and  he  has  regular  contact  with  that  child.    The
    appellant's case is that she is the main carer for that child on  those
    contact visits and Mr [T] would not be able to  exercise  his  frequent
    contact to the child if the appellant was not here to help  look  after
    the child.  The child has a wonderful relationship with  the  appellant
    who is effectively a second mother to the child.  The  relationship  is
    completely genuine.  It cannot be in the interests of the child who  is
    British to leave the UK and therefore the appellant must stay in the UK
    to exercise her right to family life with her genuine partner  and  his
    child.  It is not in the child's interests for the appellant to have to
    leave the UK.  The decision of the respondent is disproportionate.

3.   The judge said that with regard to the Rules the issue  in  dispute  is
    whether there are insurmountable obstacles  to  family  life  with  the
    partner outside the UK.  The relationship is accepted as genuine and it
    is the position of the partner's child that forms  the  cornerstone  of
    the appellant's case.  If the partner were to move to Jamaica  so  that
    family life were exercised outside the UK, the child would be adversely
    affected and would lose her life with her father and this is not in her
    interests.  She would also lose her very close ties  to  the  appellant
    who is effectively her stepmother.

4.   The judge had the court order regarding [O] dated 29 April 2016.   This
    makes a Child Arrangements Order  which  includes  provisions  for  the
    child to be taken abroad with the consent of the other parent and gives
    alternate weekend contact and half school  holidays  to  Mr  [T].   The
    judge held that this  was  consistent  with  the  claims  made  by  the
    appellant that Mr [T] has had regular contact with his daughter who was
    age 7 from 2016.

5.   The judge had a wage slip for Mr  [T]  for  February  2018  showing  47
    hours worked in the month and wages of �375.  The judge held  this  was
    consistent with his claim to work two and a  half  hours  a  day  as  a
    cleaner.  The bank statement for Mr [T] showed his wages were  paid  in
    and regular maintenance of �30 per month for his daughter.

6.   The judge found both the appellant and her partner's oral  evidence  to
    be exaggerated and unreliable in many ways.  For example,  the  partner
    claimed he would not be able to have contact with his daughter  as  the
    appellant was needed to wash the child and do her hair  and  even  cook
    for her as he was unable to do any of that.  The judge did  not  accept
    this.  On cross-examination Mr [T] confirmed that he  had  two  sisters
    but claimed they would be unable to help him  as  one  worked  and  the
    other was disabled.  The judge said the appellant  only  mentioned  one
    sister and the judge found that the appellant was being  untruthful  in
    this.  The couples' claim that Mr  [T]  was  unable  to  cook  for  his
    daughter and feed her was rejected by the  judge  as  untrue.   Mr  [T]
    referred to his daughter being mature and could give no reason why  she
    would be unable to bath herself if it was inappropriate for  him  as  a
    man to assist.  The judge found that the appellant's presence in the UK
    was not required for [O] to have contact with her father.

7.   The judge said he had  read  the  letter  of  [O]  which  explains  her
    affection for the appellant.  The judge accepted that [O]  is  fond  of
    the appellant and that the appellant looks after [O] for the few  hours
    that Mr [T] is at work on contact days.  Mr [T] gave evidence  that  he
    worked from 5 to 7.30 in the evening.  The judge found that it  was  in
    the interests of [O]  for  the  current  arrangements  to  continue  as
    stability was  normally  in  the  best  interests  of  a  young  child.
    However, the judge found that [O] would be able  to  continue  to  have
    contact with her father in  the  appellant's  absence  and  that  other
    arrangements could be made to ensure  this  continued  to  happen.   He
    again repeated that the appellant's presence was not necessary for  the
    child to continue to have contact with her father.   Whilst  the  judge
    found that [O] may miss the appellant should she return to Jamaica, she
    would continue to live with her own mother and see her father and other
    relatives and that her situation would continue to be  stable  in  this
    way and that her welfare would  not  be  significantly  harmed  by  the
    absence of the appellant.  [O] has not been shown to have  any  special
    needs or vulnerabilities.

8.   The judge noted that Mr  [T]  gave  evidence  that  the  appellant  has
    family including her mother in  Jamaica  and  that  he  has  family  in
    Jamaica.  The judge found that the appellant has contacts and family in
    Jamaica who can give her some emotional support on her return and  that
    she has not shown that she will be alone or  destitute.   She  will  be
    able to remain in contact with Mr [T] through modern media and with [O]
    if she wishes.

9.   The judge found that the appellant's partner was  fully  aware  of  her
    status and entered into the relationship in the knowledge that she  had
    no right to be in the UK.  The judge found that the appellant had  made
    no attempt to regularise her stay in the UK until the application  made
    in 2016 after Mr [T] had obtained his court order.

10.  In conclusion the judge accepted  that  the  appellant  has  a  genuine
    relationship with Mr [T].  If Mr [T] wishes he can move to  Jamaica  to
    be with the appellant.  He has a relationship  with  his  daughter  who
    lives with her mother.  The daughter could visit  him  in  Jamaica  and
    they can maintain contact.   Whilst  he  may  not  wish  to  leave  his
    daughter in the UK, her presence is not an insurmountable  obstacle  to
    family life of the couple taking place outside the UK.  His  daughter's
    welfare and interests is something that he will take into account  when
    making a choice as to whether to move to Jamaica.  The judge found that
    the appellant does not satisfy EX.1 as a partner.

11.  With respect to private life under paragraph 276ADE,  the  judge  found
    that the appellant has not lost  all  contacts  and  knowledge  of  her
    homeland.  She has no particular health problems that would prevent her
    from looking  after  herself  in  Jamaica.   She  has  not  shown  very
    significant  obstacles  to  integration  and  does  not  satisfy   Rule
    276ADE(vi).

12.  The  judge  then  considered  whether  the  respondent's  decision  was
    disproportionate.  The judge found that the appellant does not  satisfy
    the Immigration Rules.  The judge questioned  whether  there  were  any
    compelling or exceptional reasons to look outside the Rules.  The judge
    found that there was nothing in  the  appellant's  situation  that  his
    consideration of the Rules above have not taken into account.

13.  The judge held that the appellant has  not  shown  that  she  is  self-
    sufficient and stated that  she  relied  upon  Mr  [T].   This  weighed
    against her.  The appellant has been in the UK since 2002 after a short
    period as a visitor.  She has been here unlawfully and made no  attempt
    to make any application for lawful status.  Any private  life  she  has
    built up has occurred when she has been here precariously.   The  judge
    gave the private life little weight.  The judge found that she  entered
    into her relationship with her partner when she  was  here  unlawfully.
    The partner has always known about her status and the relationship they
    have had in the UK has been in that full knowledge.  The judge gave the
    relationship little weight on that basis.  The  judge  found  that  the
    relationship can continue outside the UK if that is the  decision  that
    the couple make.  Alternatively, they can communicate through Skype and
    other means.

14.  The judge held that the appellant can  make  an  application  to  enter
    under the Rules if she is in a position to do so in  the  future.   The
    child [O] is of course affected by the decision  and  the  judge  found
    that it is in her interests that the current situation  remains  as  it
    is.  However, the judge  found  that  [O]  will  not  be  so  adversely
    affected by the appellant's removal that the  appellant's  presence  is
    necessary for the child's wellbeing.  In view of the blatant  disregard
    of the UK immigrations laws and the fact that  the  child's  main  home
    will not be affected by the decision, the judge found that the  child's
    welfare,  which  is  a  primary  consideration   but   not   the   only
    consideration, does not require that the appellant remains in  the  UK.
    The public interest in firm and fair immigration control is met by  the
    appellant's, who has shown such disregard for the UK laws, removal.  In
    all the circumstances the judge found that the decision to refuse leave
    was proportionate.

15.  Mr Wilcox submitted that there was no proper consideration of  EX.1  by
    the judge.  He said there are clearly insurmountable obstacles  to  the
    appellant continuing her relationship with her partner were she  to  be
    removed to Jamaica.  The insurmountable obstacle is  that  her  partner
    has parental responsibility for his child and  ongoing  contact  rights
    which he exercises with the child which he would not  realistically  be
    able to exercise  were  he  to  relocate  to  Jamaica.   The  important
    consideration is that he would not have direct  and  continued  regular
    contact with the child which is mandated in a court order.   The  judge
    found it would not be in the child's  best  interests  to  disrupt  the
    current arrangement which includes  the  way  in  which  the  appellant
    facilitates the ongoing contact that the child is able to have with her
    father.  Mr Wilcox submitted that for that to happen it  would  require
    the appellant's partner to be with the  appellant.   For  that  not  to
    happen would amount to an insurmountable obstacle for  the  application
    of EX.1.

16.  Mr Wilcox further  argued  that  in  consideration  of  proportionality
    outside the Rules, the judge made a clear  error.   He  submitted  that
    Ruppiah says that it is not in the public interest in terms of  Section
    117B(5) if such an arrangement does not violate the requirement of self-
    sufficiency in the way that the judge stated.

17.  Mr Tufan said that Mr Wilcox was right about Ruppiah  but  argued  that
    the point raised therein is a neutral factor in Section 117B.

18.  Mr Tufan said the situation is this,  the  appellant's  partner  has  a
    child he has contact with  on  alternative  weekends  and  half  school
    holidays.  The judge considered this  evidence  and  found  that  other
    arrangements could be made.  Mr Tufan submitted that the appellant  has
    not stepped  into  the  shoes  of  [O]'s  mother.   He  relied  on  the
    Tribunal's decision in R (on the application  of  RK)  v  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department (s.117B(6); "parental relationship")  IJR
    [2016] UKUT 0031 (IAC).  The Tribunal in its headnote 2 held:

         "2.  Whether a person who is  not  a  biological  parent  is  in  a
             'parental relationship' with  a  child  for  the  purposes  of
             s.117B(6) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002
             depends on the individual circumstances and whether  the  role
             that individual plays establishes he or she has 'stepped  into
             the shoes' of a parent."

19.  Mr Tufan submitted that the judge considered the best interests of  the
    child and made detailed findings on that issue.

20.  Mr Tufan submitted that the judge found that the appellant  can  go  to
    Jamaica and make an entry clearance application.  He relied on Chen and
    Agyarko which he said confirmed that if  need  be  an  entry  clearance
    application can be made.  He relied on SB Bangladesh  which  held  that
    the outcome of an entry clearance application is not a consideration in
    the proportionality exercise.  Mr Tufan submitted that there  would  be
    no unjustifiably harsh consequences for the child if the appellant were
    to be removed to Jamaica.   He  submitted  that  the  judge's  decision
    disclosed no material error of law.

21.  I found no error of law in the judge's decision.   I  find  that  judge
    properly considered whether there were insurmountable obstacles to  the
    appellant continuing her relationship with her partner were she  to  be
    removed to Jamaica.  I find  that  the  judge  cleared  considered  the
    contact order and the arrangement  within  that  court  order  for  the
    appellant's partner to have the child on alternate  weekends  and  half
    school holidays.  The judge found that the appellant's presence in  the
    UK  was  not  required  for  [O]  to  have  contact  with  her  father.
    Alternatively, the judge found that other arrangements  could  be  made
    for the care of the child.  In any event, applying RK, I find that  the
    appellant has not stepped into the shoes of [O]'s mother.  I agree with
    the judge's finding that [O] will continue to live with her own  mother
    and that her situation will continue to be stable in this way and  that
    her welfare will not be significantly harmed  by  the  absence  of  the
    appellant. Therefore, I find that the contact order and the appellant's
    partner's relationship with [O] does not amount to an insurmountable to
    their relationship continuing were she to be removed to Jamaica.

22.  The judge properly found that the appellant can go to Jamaica and  make
    an entry clearance application to join her partner in the UK.   I  find
    that  the  outcome  of  an  entry  clearance  application  is   not   a
    consideration  in  the  proportionality   exercise.    Therefore,   the
    appellant should be able to make the  application  when  her  partner's
    circumstances change, and he is able to support her application.

23.  The judge's finding that it is in the interests of [O] for the  current
    arrangements to continue as stability is normally in the best interests
    of a child does not materially undermine the overall findings  made  by
    the judge. The point raised in Ruppiah is a neutral factor  in  Section
    117B.

24.  I find that the judge's decision  is  well  reasoned  and  sound.   The
    decision does not disclose an error of law.



Notice of Decision

25.  I find that  on  the  evidence  the  judge's  decision  dismissing  the
    appellant's appeal should stand.

No anonymity direction is made.
