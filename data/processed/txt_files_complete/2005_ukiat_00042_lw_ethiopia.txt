                             DECISION ON APPEAL

   This is an appeal from a decision  of  an  adjudicator  (Mr  JG  Peart),
   sitting at Taylor House on 8 July 2004, dismissing an asylum  and  human
   rights appeal by a citizen of Ethiopia.  Permission  was  given  on  the
   basis of the attitude taken by the adjudicator to  the  claimant  having
   been granted asylum in Uganda, as it is accepted she was in 1995.

2. The refusal letter unfortunately misunderstood the  claimant's  case  on
   that point, which appeared, but with nothing to mark it out  as  of  any
   importance, at � 11 of her SEF statement  at  B12  of  the  Home  Office
   bundle: as Mr Quy himself  pointed  out,  �  7  of  the  refusal  letter
   suggested that the claimant had said she  had  been  refused  asylum  in
   Uganda. The point was, to her credit, taken by  Miss  (not  Mr,  as  the
   adjudicator calls her at that point, we think) Rehman at  the  start  of
   the hearing before the adjudicator.  The  claimant's  representative  at
   that stage (Mr Nigar, not appearing  as  counsel,  but  as  a  barrister
   employed by her then solicitors) was clearly  completely  unprepared  to
   deal with it, and it was  Miss  Rehman  who  mentioned  that  there  was
   authority (though she could not cite it) on the point.

3. To his credit, the adjudicator took the trouble to  get  that  authority
   through the Legal and Research Department  of  the  IAA:  it  is  Babela
   [2002] UKIAT 06124. Babela was a citizen of Congo (Brazzaville) who  had
   been granted asylum in South Africa. It seems the issue in his case (see
   � 32 of the Tribunal decision) was whether things had changed enough  in
   the Congo since then for the cessation clause at article 1 C (5) of  the
   Refugee Convention to apply. The main  issue  in  the  present  case  is
   whether the adjudicator was justified in taking the view  that  what  he
   saw as the incredibility of the claimant's account meant that she should
   never have been given asylum by the Ugandan  authorities  in  the  first
   place. It follows that what  the  Tribunal  said  in  Babela  about  the
   operation of the cessation clause is strictly obiter; but clearly  there
   was a good deal in what they said intended to be of general application.

4. What the Tribunal said in Babela, so far as relevant, was this:

  27. The main question for us is what significance is to be  given  to  the
      fact that the Appellant had refugee status recognised in South  Africa
      at the time when he arrived.  There is nothing in the 1951  Convention
      that requires a state to recognise grants of refugee status by another
      contracting state.  We cannot be bound by the 1978 Executive Committee
      minute of UNHCR, despite its very positive recognition of the need for
      contracting states to recognise each other's grants of refugee status.
       It is not  part  of  the  1951  Convention  and,  being  a  statutory
      Tribunal,  we  are  therefore  precluded  from   giving   it   effect.
      Similarly, the advice contained in the recent letter from  the  UNHCR,
      whilst persuasive, is not binding upon us.


  28. It seems to us that the appropriate starting point in looking at  this
      Appellant's asylum application should  have  been  the  fact  that  he
      already had refugee status.  It is clearly  recognised  by  the  UNHCR
      minute and the UNHCR letter  that  the  grant  of  status  is  a  very
      significant  matter.   It  is  a  continuing  status.   If   we   were
      considering a grant of refugee status  by  the  United  Kingdom,  that
      could only be ended if the Appellant falls to be considered under  one
      of the cessation clauses  in  Article  1.C  of  the  Convention.   The
      question is, therefore, how much weight  to  put  upon  this  previous
      grant.  In our opinion, the answer is, a great  deal.   We  adopt  the
      UNHCR's views set out in their letter of 24 July, where they say:-


      "Refugee status, once granted, should  not  be  reviewed  or  annulled
      except on the most substantial and clear grounds."


      We also note the terms of the minute that refugee status determined in
      one contracting state should only be called into question  by  another
      contracting state in exceptional cases.  The letter  goes  on  to  say
      that the well-foundedness of Mr Babela's fear of  persecution  in  the
      Congo should not be open to question.  It explains  the  rationale  of
      all this by  saying  that  if  international  protection  is  to  have
      practical meaning, then refugee status should have some stability  and
      certitude and refugees should be assured that their status will not be
      likely tampered with.  We also note that the UNHCR were  of  the  view
      that  this  Appellant's  request  for  a  transfer  should  have  been
      considered in a humanitarian spirit.  By no stretch of the imagination
      can the way this Appellant was treated at Heathrow and subsequently be
      considered to be humanitarian.  He was treated disgracefully.  That  a
      state contracted to the 1951 Refugee Convention should behave in  such
      a way to a  person  who  has  been  granted  such  status  by  another
      contracting state is almost unbelievable.


  29. The Appellant's  previous  refugee  status  should  therefore  not  be
      questioned unless there is a very good reason for doing so.   No  such
      reason has been put forward here in our  view  and,  therefore,  prima
      facie he has made out his entitlement to refugee status in the  United
      Kingdom.  However, that is rebuttable and we consider that the correct
      approach is to say that the burden of proof in rebutting  that  is  on
      the Respondent.  We have considered the arguments concerning Arif  and
      take the view that this appeal  falls  firmly  within  the  principles
      enumerated in Arif.  In some ways, it can be said  to  be  a  stronger
      argument than that in Arif itself.  Arif was argued on the basis  that
      if it was thought that Mr Arif's application  for  asylum  would  have
      been granted at the time that it was made, then the onus  was  on  the
      Respondent to establish that  there  had  been  sufficient  change  in
      circumstances in his country of origin in the meantime,  in  order  to
      defeat that application.  Here, this Appellant was a  refugee.   There
      is no question of having to look back and assess his situation  at  an
      earlier date than when the decision was made.


  30. To deal with the burden of proof in this way, in our  view,  satisfies
      the considerations under  the  Convention  as  to  whether  or  not  a
      cessation clause applies.  It equally satisfies the guidance (which we
      find very persuasive) of the UNHCR in saying that  the  status  should
      not be lightly tampered with; that the status should not  be  reviewed
      or annulled except on the most  substantial  and  clear  grounds.   We
      recognise that in Dyli the Tribunal sought to distinguish the majority
      of cases from Arif but, as we have said, we think that this case falls
      firmly into the Arif principles.

7. Miss Braganza relied on the last sentence of �  29  in  Babela;  but,  we
   think rightly, she did not suggest that, even if  taken  as  applying  to
   this kind of case, it prevented either the Home Office or an  adjudicator
   from considering whether asylum had been rightly  granted  in  the  first
   place. Instead she argued that this should not be done  unless  the  Home
   Office had first shown, in the words of � 30, "the most  substantial  and
   clear grounds". She suggested that it was not open to  them  to  persuade
   the adjudicator on the whole of the evidence before him, even bearing the
   burden of proof themselves, that there were such  grounds.  Instead  they
   must do so on the material available at the outset of the hearing, rather
   than go on what she described as a "fishing expedition".

8. There is no doubt much to be said, as the UNHCR  did  in  their  comments
   recorded in Babela, on the importance of international comity in  matters
   of status. There is also a good deal to be said on the other  side  about
   the difficulties likely to be caused by  placing  too  much  reliance  on
   grants of status in  countries  outside  the  European  Union  (to  which
   special  arrangements  apply),  where  procedures  may   be   less   than
   transparent and standards in public life lower than  we  should  like  to
   think they are here. As those familiar  with  the  format  of  grants  of
   asylum in this country will be aware, there is no transparency about them
   in the form of  reasoning  even  here;  and  there  may  at  times  be  a
   suspicion, justifiable or not, that they are sometimes given for  reasons
   which do not go far beyond expediency.

9. Mr Quy did not argue, and we do not see  any  reason  for  not  requiring
   "the most substantial and clear grounds" as a condition  for  interfering
   with a previous grant of asylum in another country on the basis  that  it
   had not been justified when made, just as it was held to be in Babela  on
   the basis of changed circumstances in the claimant's country  of  origin.
   Miss Braganza on the other hand referred us to no  authority  to  support
   her argument that this condition had to be decided as a preliminary issue
   by adjudicators. The general line  of  Tribunal  authority  has  been  to
   discourage dealing with  issues  in  that  way,  except  where  obviously
   necessary or required by legislation (as for example  with  questions  of
   extensions of time). In our view decisions, at least at a first  instance
   hearing, are best made on the basis of all the facts which have come  out
   in the course of the hearing.

10.  That  is  not  to  encourage  what  Miss   Braganza   called   "fishing
   expeditions". Clearly in cases of this kind, adjudicators need to bear in
   mind from the start that it is the Home Office who have to show "the most
   substantial and clear grounds"  for  revisiting  the  previous  grant  of
   asylum; but they should decide whether or not that has been done  on  the
   whole of the facts before them. What happened in  the  present  case  may
   well have been the result of the most unfortunate mistake (see 2) in �  7
   of the refusal letter. The adjudicator certainly said this at � 23:

   The refugee status accorded to the Appellant by the  Ugandan  authorities
   is significant, however I will address issues of credibility relating  to
   the Appellant's account of events occurring in both Ethiopia  and  Uganda
   before considering the implications of Babela.

11. While we do not accept Miss Braganza's  argument  that  the  adjudicator
   should have given a preliminary ruling on the  effect  of  Babela  before
   going on to consider credibility in detail at all, we do  agree  that  he
   needed, as a matter of law, to show that he had taken the previous  grant
   of asylum, not just as significant, but as  the  starting-point  for  his
   consideration of the case. What this adjudicator did  was  in  effect  to
   consider (with great care and energy, at �� 23-36, whether  the  detailed
   criticisms in the grounds of appeal are made out or not) the  credibility
   of the claimant's account just as if it had been given  on  a  claim  for
   asylum made for the first time in this country; only then did he go on to
   say (at � 38) that  his  credibility  findings  rebutted  the  claimant's
   entitlement to refugee status.

12. It was the way the Home Office had dealt with the  claimant's  case  (or
   failed to deal with it on this point) which had made it rather  difficult
   for the adjudicator to deal with it on the correct basis,  that  she  had
   been granted asylum in Uganda. In our  view  he  would  have  been  amply
   justified in adjourning the hearing before him until the Home Office  had
   taken stock of and set out their attitude  to  this  potentially  crucial
   fact. As we put it to the parties without disagreement  from  them,  what
   has happened is that the claimant's case has  been  dealt  with,  without
   either the adjudicator or the Home Office considering the  facts  on  the
   proper basis.

13. The result of our allowing the  claimant's  appeal  from  his  decision,
   without ourselves going into the merits of the case, as we  do,  is  that
   the field remains open for the Home Office to consider whether there  are
   "the most substantial and  clear  grounds"  for  revisiting  the  Ugandan
   grant, either on the basis that:


        a) the claimant's account should never have been  accepted  by  the
           authorities there; or
        b) enough time has passed, and changes come about in  Ethiopia  for
           her no longer to be at risk there;
           or else:
        c) for  them  to  consider  whether  they  ought  to  give  removal
           directions, if at all, for Uganda rather than Ethiopia.
14. We do take Mr Quy's point that, under  the  current  Act,  the  decision
   under appeal is the decision to remove, and not the  removal  directions
   themselves; but we should like to re-emphasize that (except for  example
   in cases involving a claimed country of origin  which  the  Home  Office
   dispute, without being in a position  to  remove  to  any  other),  both
   claimants and adjudicators are entitled to have the Home Office set  out
   what they actually propose to do in  appealable  form,  if  not  in  the
   notice of removal directions themselves, then at least in some  document
   (such as the refusal letter) which can be treated as forming part of the
   decision under appeal.

15. Since the hearing took place, our  attention  has  been  drawn  (not  by
   either of the parties)  to  the  UNHCR  'Note  on  the  Cancellation  of
   Refugee Status', published 22 November 2004. The summary of their  views
   reads (with our lettering for clarity

    a) ...the invalidation of refugee status may be lawful only if there are
       grounds for cancellation, supported by adequate evidence;

    b)  if the consequences of cancellation for the individual concerned are
       clearly not disproportionate and of a seriously  prejudicial  nature;
       and

    c) if the decision to cancel is made in due observance of the guarantees
       and safeguards of procedural fairness.

16. Needless to say, we have not heard argument on that Note, and it  cannot
   form part of our reasoning. It will have to be considered  another  time
   whether it accurately represents international law  on  the  point,  and
   whether it ought to form the basis for the laws  of  these  islands.  No
   doubt  consideration  will  be  given  on  the  same  occasion  to   the
   correctness or otherwise  of  Babela.  For  the  present,  our  decision
   stands: the Home Office should consider for themselves the effect of the
   Ugandan grant, and whether it ought to be subject  to  cancellation  for
   the reasons given by the adjudicator, or because of any  other  relevant
   consideration. They should take their own view of  the  UNHCR  Note,  on
   which they will no doubt wish to take legal advice.
