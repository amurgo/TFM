                                   Between

                                 Rushel [M]
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               The Secretary Of State For The Home Department
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr J. Waithe, Counsel, instructed by Okafor & Co.,
Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr S. Kotas, Home Office Presenting Officer


           Direction remitting the case to the First-tier Tribunal

Whereas:

1.   My decision (i) finding that there was an error on a point of  law  and
(ii) setting aside the determination of the First-tier Tribunal was sent  to
the parties on 6 December 2017

2.   I directed that the Upper Tribunal hear and determine  the  appeal  and
re-make the decision and gave directions for the hearing of  the  appeal  in
the Upper Tribunal.

3.   Neither Mr Kotas acting for the Secretary of  State  nor  the  Tribunal
knew that the appellant's  mother  had  received  a  decision  refusing  her
application for a derivative  residence  card  following  her  divorce  from
[PR], (a French national and this appellant's step-father).

4.   The appellant's mother, [CD], has appealed against the decision to  the
First-tier Tribunal and her appeal numbered EA/04375/2017 will be  heard  on
11 May 2018 at Taylor House.

5.   The issues raised in the mother's appeal are, in part, the same  issues
as are to be determined in this appellant's appeal.

6.   In  order  to  avoid  any  inconsistency  in  decision  making  in  the
respective appeals of mother and daughter, the remaking of the  decision  in
the daughter's appeal should be heard and determined by the same  judge  who
hears and determines the mother's appeal.

ORDER

      i) I set aside my  decision  directing  that  the  re-making  of  this
         decision is to be heard in the Upper Tribunal and direct that it is
         linked to the mother's appeal.

     ii) I remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal for it to be  re-made
         with the mother's appeal on 11 May 2018 at Taylor House.

    iii)  The  material  in  the  two  appeals  (including  the   respective
         statements of the parties' cases in this appeal) shall be common to
         both.


                                                               ANDREW JORDAN
                                                 JUDGE OF THE UPPER TRIBUNAL
                                                            13 February 2018
