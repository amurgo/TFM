                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

       This is an appeal, by the , against the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge PJG White), sitting at Manchester on 21 March,  to   on
    'common-law fairness' grounds tier 2 (general) migrant  PBS  appeal  by
    the (main) appellant, a citizen of India, born 4 January 1987, and  his
    dependent wife. The appellants were  refused  leave  to  remain  on  17
    December 2012 because the appellant's college appeared on line to  have
    been refused a sponsorship licence that October; but it is  now  common
    ground that it had one again by the date of the decision, though  under
    a different address.



 2. The evidence to show that was not before the judge, who instead allowed
    the appeals on the basis that it was unfair for the Home Office to rely
    on the situation as they had seen it, without giving the appellant  the
    password necessary  to  check  the  situation  for  himself.  This  was
    ingenious; but again it is agreed that it was a step too far; and wrong
    in law, because in proceedings of this kind, with exceptions  which  do
    not arise in this case, it is always for  an  appellant  to  prove  his
    case, enlisting if necessary the help of the courts in order to do so.

 3. Since however it is now clear that the appellant was  entitled  to  the
    extension he sought by the date of the decision under appeal,  I  allow
    the Home Office appeal, but re-make the first-tier decision by allowing
    his appeal, and his wife's, on that basis. I should expect  the  result
    to be the grant of tier 2 leave to both of  them  for  the  appropriate
    period from 17 December last; but if there should be  any  difficulties
    about that, then an application may  be  made  directly  to  me  for  a
    suitable direction. The judge made an award of ï¿½80 costs: though I have
    reached the same result by another route, it does stand,  and  so  does
    the costs award.
