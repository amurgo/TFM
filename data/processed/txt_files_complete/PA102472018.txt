Representation:
For the Appellants:    Ms Radford, Counsel instructed by Duncan Lewis
solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms Everett, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. The appellants are citizens of Ukraine. The first appellant (hereafter
      "the appellant") was born on 2 January 1974.  He  is  married  to  the
      second appellant, who was born on 7 December 1977.

   2. The appellant claims to be at risk on return to Ukraine because he has
      evaded military  conscription.  He  claims  that  three  notifications
      requiring him to report for military service were received by his wife
      in 2014.

   3. The appellant's claim was rejected by the  respondent.  The  appellant
      appealed to the First-tier Tribunal where  his  appeal  was  heard  by
      Judge Traynor ("the judge"). In a  decision  promulgated  on  19  June
      2019, the judge dismissed the appeal. The appellant is  now  appealing
      against that decision.

   4. The judge did not find the appellant credible. Amongst  other  things,
      the judge found damaging to the appellant's credibility  that  he  had
      not explained in the papers, or provided medical evidence  to  confirm
      the position in respect of, a noticeable eye defect. At  paragraph  38
      the judge stated:

           "What is not explained in the  papers,  and  the  appellant  has
           provided no medical evidence to confirm this, is the  fact  that
           the  appellant  has  a  very  noticeable  eye  defect  which  is
           immediate apparent [sic]  to  everyone.  Neither  representative
           dealt with this and it was left to me to enquire as  to  whether
           the appellant suffered from any health problems. It was only  in
           the course  of  this  clarification  of  his  evidence  that  he
           explained that he had sight problems with his left eye following
           an injury in childhood but he claimed his vision was reduced  by
           only 10%. When I enquired of him as to whether  or  not  he  was
           aware this  may  be  sufficient  to  exempt  him  from  military
           service, given his sight problems, he responded by stating  that
           he did not think that was possible and that, in  any  event,  he
           had been issued with a Ukrainian driving licence and was allowed
           to drive. Significantly, he told me that he had never asked  the
           authorities for any  exemption  on  the  grounds  of  his  sight
           problems."

   Grounds of Appeal and Submissions

   5. The grounds of appeal make a single argument, which is that the  judge
      developed his own case theory regarding the appellant's eye condition.
      At paragraph 9 of the grounds it is stated that there was  no  mention
      of the appellant's eye  condition  in  the  respondent's  reasons  for
      refusal letter. The grounds cite case law where judges  are  cautioned
      to avoid developing their own theories of a case.

   6. At the commencement of the hearing I drew Ms  Radford's  attention  to
      paragraphs 65 and 66 of the respondent's reasons for  refusal  letter.
      Paragraph 65 starts by stating that the appellant has confirmed he has
      a sight condition and then proceeds to set out three different sources
      of information concerning exemptions from military service on  medical
      grounds in Ukraine. At paragraph 66 the respondent stated:

           'Therefore based on the information above, it is considered that
           the issue with your  eyesight  would  deem  you  unsuitable  for
           military service, especially in a  combat  role,  and  that  any
           medical  examination  would  render  you  unsuitable  to  handle
           military equipment owing to your condition.'

   7. Ms  Radford  acknowledged  that  the  eye  issue  was  raised  by  the
      respondent (even though the contrary had been asserted in the grounds)
      but argued that  the  judge  erred  nonetheless  because  the  judge's
      finding that the  appellant  would  not  be  conscripted  for  medical
      reasons was based on speculation and not grounded in the evidence. She
      argued that the only evidence on this issue  was  that  given  by  the
      appellant and the judge had misconstrued and/or ignored it.


   Analysis

   8. The argument in the grounds of appeal is misconceived as the judge did
      not develop his own case theory. As is clear from paragraphs 65 and 66
      of the reasons for refusal letter, the  argument  that  the  appellant
      would be unsuitable for military service because of his eye  condition
      was made by the respondent. This is a case in which the  judge  agreed
      with the position taken by the respondent. It is not a case  where  it
      can be said that the judge developed his own theory.

   9. Ms Radford argued that the grounds can  be  read  as  challenging  the
      judge making findings regarding the appellant's eye condition that are
      not supported by the evidence. I do not accept that the grounds  cover
      this argument as they make only one submission which is that the judge
      developed his own case theory.

  10. In any event, I am not persuaded that Ms Radford's argument has merit.
      The respondent was clear in the reasons for  refusal  letter  that  he
      took the view that the appellant's eye condition meant he would not be
      considered  suitable  for  military  service.  The  appellant   cannot
      therefore argue he was taken by  surprise  by  this  matter  being  at
      issue. It was open to the appellant, upon whom  the  burden  of  proof
      lay, in light of the respondent's position, to submit  evidence  (such
      as a medical report) to  substantiate  his  claim  that  he  would  be
      conscripted despite his eye condition. However, no such  evidence  was
      adduced and the appellant relied solely on his  witness  evidence.  It
      was for the judge to decide whether to accept the witness evidence  or
      not; and  no  error  of  law  arises  from  the  judge  accepting  the
      respondent's  position  and  deciding  that  the  appellant's  witness
      evidence was not sufficient to discharge the burden of proof.

  11. The appeal is therefore dismissed.


Notice of Decision

The appeal is dismissed. The decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  does  not
contain a material error of law and stands.
