Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms L Simak, instructed by Shah Law Chambers
For the Respondent:    Mr A McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. This has been a remote hearing to which there has  been  no  objection
      from the parties. The form of remote hearing was skype for business. A
      face to face hearing was not held because it was not practicable,  and
      all issues could be determined in a remote hearing.

   2. The appellant is a Pakistan national born  on  15  December  1982.  He
      appeals, with permission,  against  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
      Tribunal dismissing his appeal against the  respondent's  decision  to
      refuse to issue him with an EEA Family Permit  under  the  Immigration
      (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016  to  enter  the  UK  as  the
      dependant direct family member (son) of  an  EEA  national  exercising
      treaty rights in the UK.

   3. The appellant applied on 24 June 2019 to join his  father,  a  Spanish
      national, in the UK. In his application, it was stated  on  behalf  of
      the appellant that he was  a  widower  with  four  children  from  his
      marriage, of whom he was the primary carer. He would  be  leaving  his
      children in the care of a family member in Pakistan. His  father,  the
      sponsor, worked as a chef in a restaurant  in  the  UK,  earning  over
      �1200 a month and had been issued with a UK  Registration  Certificate
      confirming his status as an EU national exercising treaty  rights.  He
      was  supporting  the  appellant  and  sending  him   funds   for   his
      maintenance, to pay his bills, for his children's  education  and  for
      his food and utilities. The appellant  was  therefore  dependent  upon
      him.

   4. The appellant's application was refused on 10 August 2019 on the basis
      of a lack of satisfactory evidence of dependency upon the sponsor. The
      respondent did not accept that the appellant was a family member of an
      EEA national in accordance with regulation 7 of the EEA Regulations.

   5. The appellant appealed the decision and produced further documents.

   6. In response, the Entry Clearance Manager upheld  the  decision  noting
      that the sponsor's monthly earnings of �1083.16 a month appeared to be
      insufficient to maintain a household, to lease a property and  support
      an additional family member; that there were a number  of  unexplained
      deposits in the sponsor's bank statements, the largest  of  which  was
      �2000 deposited on 17 May  2019;  the  fact  that  the  appellant  was
      leaving his children in the care of another family member in  Pakistan
      suggested that he had support available to him  in  that  country  and
      that it was therefore not  clear  why  he  would  leave  his  children
      without their father to care for them; and that the sponsor  had  been
      sending money back to Pakistan but not all the amounts had  been  sent
      to the appellant directly and there were only limited payments made in
      2017 and 2015.

   7. The appellant's appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Ross  on
      4 March 2020 and was dismissed in a decision promulgated on  20  April
      2020. The judge heard from the EEA sponsor,  the  appellant's  father,
      and recorded his evidence that he sent money to Pakistan every  month,
      sometimes �250 and other times �300 a month which the  appellant  used
      for his every day living expenses; that the appellant's wife died  two
      years ago and he lived together with his children with his mother  and
      that he worked as a farmer. The sponsor had left Pakistan in 1982  the
      year that the appellant was born and went to work in Saudi Arabia  and
      then for ten years in Spain. He had another son and two daughters  and
      his son, who was 17 years of age, lived with him in the UK and was  at
      college. The family owned the land which the appellant farmed and  the
      appellant sold surplus produce  which  brought  an  income  of  around
      15,000 PKR a month. The sponsor said that the appellant used the money
      he sent him to pay for his children's school fees. The  �2000  deposit
      in his bank account was an amount he had borrowed from a friend to pay
      for some building work on his home in Pakistan. The  appellant  wanted
      to come to the UK to work, so that he could send  money  home  to  his
      family. It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that two thirds of
      the amount sent by the sponsor to Pakistan  each  month  was  for  the
      appellant.

   8. The judge accepted  that  there  was  documentary  evidence  of  money
      transfers from the sponsor to  Pakistan,  noting  that  they  were  to
      different names and were varying amounts. He considered  that  it  was
      clear from the evidence that the  appellant  had  his  own  income  in
      Pakistan from his farming enterprise.  Whilst  he  accepted  that  the
      sponsor contributed to the appellant's household income  which  helped
      him pay for his children's school fees, he did  not  accept  that  the
      appellant was dependent on the amounts transferred by his  father  and
      considered there to be a scarcity of evidence of dependency. The judge
      also endorsed the ECM's conclusions, noting that the  sponsor  had  to
      accommodate and support his youngest son and pay rent and  bills  from
      his �1083.16 a month income and that he had  unexplained  deposits  in
      his account and needed to borrow from  friends.  The  judge  did  not,
      therefore, accept that this was a genuine case  of  an  EEA  dependent
      relative having to move to the UK because of a dependency  on  an  EEA
      sponsor, but considered that the purpose of the appellant  wanting  to
      come to the UK was to work and support his children by  sending  money
      back to Pakistan. The judge did not  accept  that  the  appellant  was
      dependent upon the sponsor and concluded that he could not satisfy the
      conditions in regulation 7 as a direct dependant of the  sponsor.  The
      judge accordingly dismissed the appeal.

   9. Permission was sought by the appellant to appeal to the Upper Tribunal
      on the following grounds: that the judge's approach to  the  issue  of
      his income from a 'farming enterprise' was erroneous as he disregarded
      the sponsor's evidence that it was simply a small plot of land  around
      the house on which he grew vegetables and speculated about  the  steps
      he could take to increase his income,  contrary  to  the  guidance  in
      Reyes (EEA Regs: dependency) [2013] UKUT 314 and Moneke (EEA - OFMs  -
      assessment of evidence) Nigeria [2011]  UKUT  00430;  that  the  judge
      relied upon an irrelevant criterion in assessing  the  appeal,  namely
      the reasons for the dependency and the steps he could take  to  reduce
      the  dependency;  that  the  judge  was  wrong  to  impose   financial
      requirements on the sponsor and erred by making adverse findings based
      upon  the  �2000  he  had  borrowed;  and  that  the  judge  erred  by
      questioning the reasons for him seeking to relocate to the UK.

  10.  Permission  was  refused  in  the  First-tier   Tribunal,   but   was
      subsequently granted in the Upper Tribunal on  renewed  grounds,  with
      particular reference to the first ground although  not  excluding  the
      other grounds.

Hearing and Submissions

  11. The matter then came before me for a remote hearing by  way  of  skype
      for business and both parties made submissions on  the  error  of  law
      issue.

  12. Ms Simak relied upon her skeleton argument and expanded upon  it.  She
      submitted that the judge had erred by failing  to  apply  the  correct
      test for financial dependency  and  by  imposing  additional  criteria
      which did not form part of the requirements under the EEA Regulations.
      With regard to the first ground, she  submitted  that  the  judge  had
      misunderstood the appellant's evidence about the  plot  of  land  from
      which he derived a small income, as it was not  a  farming  enterprise
      which could have produced a larger income but was a small area of land
      around his house. As for  the  second  ground,  the  judge  improperly
      introduced into the test  a  consideration  of  the  reasons  for  the
      dependency, and unlawfully engaged in speculation as to the steps  the
      appellant could  take  to  reduce  the  dependency,  contrary  to  the
      guidance in Reyes (Judgment of the Court) [2014]  EUECJ  C-423/12  and
      Moneke and others (EEA - OFMs) Nigeria [2011] UKUT 341. It  was  clear
      from SM (India) v Entry Clearance Officer  (Mumbai)  [2009]  EWCA  Civ
      1426 that provided the judge did not find the evidence to be absent or
      unreliable, he should accept the oral evidence of dependency. As  for
      the third ground, the judge had erred by imposing additional financial
      criteria, including the sponsor's ability to sponsor the appellant, in
      light of a deposit of �2000 into his account which was a loan  from  a
      friend. There was evidence of money transfers from the sponsor to  the
      appellant  over  a  five  year  period  and  that  was  sufficient  to
      demonstrate the dependency. With regard  to  the  fourth  ground,  the
      judge had erred by questioning the appellant's reasons for  relocating
      to the UK,  which  was  an  irrelevant  consideration  under  the  EEA
      Regulations.

  13. Mr  McVeety  submitted  that  whether  or  not  the  judge  introduced
      irrelevant considerations, none  of  that  was  material  because  the
      appellant had not demonstrated dependency upon  the  sponsor,  in  the
      terms set out in Lim v Entry Clearance Officer Manila [2015] EWCA  Civ
      1383, namely to meet his essential needs. The evidence  was  that  the
      sponsor simply contributed towards  the  appellant's  income  and  the
      unchallenged oral evidence was that the money from the sponsor was for
      the appellant's children's school fees. Therefore the  money  was  for
      the children and not for the appellant and that was  the  end  of  the
      matter. The judge therefore made no material errors of law.

  14. In response, Ms Simak submitted that the appellant had not  said  that
      the money was only for his children, but was for  his  household.  The
      evidence was that 70% of the money sent to  Pakistan  by  the  sponsor
      went to the appellant, and only part of that was  for  his  children's
      schooling. If the money was not sent there would be insufficient funds
      for clothing and  food.  It  was  therefore  wrong  to  say  that  the
      appellant did not benefit personally. Ms Simak reiterated her previous
      submission, that the judge had erred by  introducing  four  additional
      criteria which did not form part of the EEA Regulations. If  the  four
      additional criteria were taken  away  the  appeal  would  have  to  be
      allowed on the evidence and on the findings made.

Discussion

  15. Whilst it may be that the judge had  regard  to  matters  which,  when
      taken  in  isolation,  were  not  specific  requirements  of  the  EEA
      Regulations, I am in agreement with the point made by Judge  Adio,  in
      refusing permission in the First-tier Tribunal, that it  was  relevant
      to look at the wider picture and the concerns expressed by  the  judge
      as to the paucity of evidence of dependency. That was also  the  point
      effectively being made by  Mr  McVeety  when  he  submitted  that  the
      appellant had simply not demonstrated dependency in the  first  place,
      in the terms set out in Lim.  At [32] in Lim the Court of Appeal said:


           "In my judgment, the critical question is whether  the  claimant
           is  in  fact  in  a  position  to  support   himself   or   not,
           and Reyes now makes that clear beyond doubt, in my view. That is
           a simple matter of fact. If he can support himself, there is  no
           dependency, even if he is given financial  material  support  by
           the EU citizen. Those additional resources are not necessary  to
           enable him to meet his basic needs."

  16. It is of note that, whilst the representations and submissions made on
      behalf of the appellant refer to the sponsor's money being relied upon
      to pay the appellant's  bills,  his  children's  education,  food  and
      utilities, neither the sponsor's statement nor that of  the  appellant
      provided any  such  specific  details.  As  Mr  McVeety  said  in  his
      submissions, the sponsor's oral evidence before the judge was that the
      money he sent was in fact spent on school fees for the children. There
      was no evidence of the school fees or the nature of the schooling,  to
      show that the money was  essential  in  order  for  them  to  have  an
      education and neither  was  there  any  evidence  of  the  appellant's
      financial circumstances to show that the money  from  his  father  was
      essential for his own living needs. Indeed it is relevant to note that
      there was no mention at all in  the  statement  and  evidence  in  the
      appeal bundles of the appellant's employment status or income  and  it
      was only at the hearing itself that the  sponsor  provided  some  oral
      evidence in that regard, referring to his son's income from farming.

  17. It is argued on behalf of  the  appellant  that  the  judge  erred  by
      focussing on the existence  of  a  "farming  enterprise"  in  Pakistan
      rather than the question of dependency on the  sponsor  and  that  the
      judge elevated what was simply a plot of land where the appellant grew
      vegetables to a larger scale entity from which he received an  income.
      However there is nothing  in  the  judge's  decision  to  support  the
      suggestion that he inflated or distorted the evidence. The  judge  was
      required to consider  the  evidence  of  the  appellant's  income  and
      financial circumstances in order to ascertain the relevant  matter  of
      dependency and it is clear that there was a notable  absence  of  such
      evidence, as he observed at [9]. The judge was simply relying  on  the
      evidence of the sponsor that his son was a farmer who made  an  income
      from selling surplus produce on the land he owned and  farmed  and  he
      recorded the sponsor's evidence as to the level of that income at [6],
      noting the paucity of further relevant evidence. He was  not  required
      to accept the claim of dependency, simply because it was made, but was
      entitled to require further evidence to support the  appellant's  case
      and to conclude that, in the absence of relevant  supporting  evidence
      the claim had not been made out.

  18. In the circumstances, and contrary  to  the  assertions  made  in  the
      grounds and by Ms Simak,  it  seems  to  me  that  there  was  nothing
      inconsistent with the guidance in Reyes, SM (India) and Moneke in  the
      judge's conclusion, that the overall picture provided by the  evidence
      was not one which satisfactorily supported the  claim  of  dependency.
      Accordingly, whilst the judge's decision could have been expressed  in
      better terms, I do not find any material errors of law  requiring  the
      decision to be set aside. On the limited evidence before the  judge  ,
      the conclusion that he reached was one which was  fully  and  properly
      open to him.



DECISION

  19. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not  involve
      an error on a point of law. I do  not  set  aside  the  decision.  The
      decision to dismiss the appeal stands.
