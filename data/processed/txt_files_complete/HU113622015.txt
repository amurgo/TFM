Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Andrew Otchie, Counsel instructed by Syed Shaheen
                    Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr C. Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal  (Judge  Anstis  sitting  at  Hatton  Cross  on  17
    February 2017) whereby the First-tier  Tribunal  dismissed  her  appeal
    against the decision of the respondent made on 5 November 2015  -  when
    the appellant had Section 3C leave following a decision in  her  favour
    by Judge Aziz promulgated on 20n April 2015 - to refuse  to  grant  her
    leave to remain on account of her having established family life as  an
    unmarried partner with a fellow national of the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  who
    had settled status in the UK on the  basis  of  long  residence.  Judge
    Anstis found that the appellant did not qualify  for  leave  to  remain
    under EX.1 of Appendix FM and also that she had not shown that she  met
    the minimum income requirement ("MIR") as she had not provided all  the
    mandatory evidence specified in Appendix FM-SE to show that her partner
    was earning at least ï¿½18,600 per annum. With regard to a claim  outside
    the Rules, Judge Anstis held that he was bound to find on  the  current
    state of the law that there were no compelling circumstances, and  that
    in any event the refusal was proportionate.

The Reasons for the Grant of Permission to Appeal

 2. On 18 October 2017 Deputy  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Taylor  granted  the
    appellant permission to appeal for the following reasons:

         It is arguable that the judge, who accepted  that  the  substantive
         requirements of the immigration rules  at  appendix  FM  were  met,
         albeit not in the way prescribed by the respondent, ought  to  have
         engaged with the arguments made on the appellant's behalf that  the
         appeal should have been allowed on article 8 grounds.

         The grounds rely on the decision in MM & ors v SSHD [2017] UKSC 10.

         It  is  arguable  that  to  say  that  there  were  no   compelling
         circumstances  and  that  in  any  event  interference   with   the
         appellant's right to respect for her family life was  proportionate
         was insufficiently reasoned.

The Rule 24 Response

 3. In a Rule  24  Response  dated  13  November  2017,  a  member  of  the
    Specialist Appeals Team said that the  application  for  permission  to
    appeal was not opposed, and he invited the Tribunal to determine  at  a
    fresh (oral) continuance hearing whether the appellant "succeeds  under
    the Rules".

Discussion

 4. The Judge did not err in law in finding  that  the  appellant  did  not
    qualify for leave to remain  under  Appendix  FM.  Although  the  Judge
    indicated at paragraph [24] of his decision that it was likely that the
    MIR was met through the partner's earnings, he rightly directed himself
    that he could not allow the appeal under  the  Rules  in  circumstances
    where the evidential requirements of Appendix FM-SE were not met. Thus,
    the proposal put forward in the Rule 24 Response is misconceived, as Mr
    Avery agreed.

 5. The sole issue is whether the Judge erred in law in his disposal of the
    Article 8 claim outside the Rules. The  Judge  may  not  have  had  the
    benefit of the  Chikwamba  line  of  authorities  being  drawn  to  his
    attention, and it does not appear that the  appellant's  representative
    cited to him the passage at paragraph [76] of MM which is relied on  by
    way of appeal. However, the law always speaks and the Judge misdirected
    himself in holding that he was constrained by authority  to  find  that
    there were no compelling circumstances justifying the  appellant  being
    granted Article 8 relief outside the Rules. Given his  earlier  finding
    that the MIR was probably met,  it  was  arguable  that  requiring  the
    appellant to return to her home country  to  make  an  application  for
    entry clearance constituted a disproportionate  interference  with  the
    right to respect for family life, as she was likely to succeed in  such
    an application under the Rules on financial grounds; and,  in  view  of
    the fact that she was not an overstayer, there was no good  reason  for
    enforcing the requirement that she should go back to her  home  country
    in order to be allowed back in again.  In short, the Judge's finding on
    proportionality was inadequately reasoned.

 6. Accordingly, as I ruled orally at the hearing, the  decision  of  Judge
    Anstis is erroneous in law - for the reasons given in paragraph 5 above
    - such that it must be set aside and remade.

 7. So the only issue left to be  resolved  was  the  forum  in  which  the
    decision should be remade. Mr Otchie, who did not appear below, invited
    me to remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal as he wished to  give
    the appellant the opportunity to serve on the Presenting Officer's Unit
    and on the Tribunal all the mandatory evidence specified by Appendix FM-
    SE in order to show that the MIR is met.  Mr  Avery  was  in  agreement
    with this proposal.

 8. Having heard from both representatives, I was satisfied that  this  was
    not an appropriate case for retention by the Upper Tribunal,  but  that
    it should be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a  fresh  hearing,
    due to the extent  of  judicial  fact-finding  that  was  going  to  be
    required to remake the decision.

 9. Although no error of law is alleged or made out  with  respect  to  the
    Judge's findings on EX.1, Mr Avery did not request that these  findings
    should be preserved. However, while they are  not  formally  preserved,
    the First-tier Tribunal can treat Judge Anstis' findings on EX.1  as  a
    starting point, in accordance with the guidance given in Devaseleen.

Conclusion

10. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained a material  error  of
    law, such that it must be set aside and remade.

Directions

11. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal at Hatton Cross for a
    de novo hearing before any judge apart from Judge Anstis.  None of  the
    findings of fact made by the previous Tribunal shall be preserved.

Anonymity
The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction, and  I  do  not
consider that the appellant requires anonymity for these proceedings in  the
Upper Tribunal.
