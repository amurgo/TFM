                       (anonymity direction not made)
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent



                            DECISION AND REMITTAL


 1. On 9 October I wrote to the parties as follows:-


         "In a Rule 24 response signed on behalf of the Secretary  of  State
         by Rhona Petterson, is the following:


               "2.  The  respondent  does   not   oppose   the   appellant's
                  application for permission  to  appeal  and  invites  the
                  Tribunal to  determine  the  appeal  with  a  fresh  oral
                  (continuance) hearing to consider whether  the  case  for
                  international protection is made out."


         I have little idea what this is supposed to mean.  Permission  has
         been granted,  as  the  respondent  is  evidently  aware,  so  any
         opposition  to  the  application  for  permission  is  irrelevant.
         Further, the notion of "a fresh  oral  (continuance)  hearing"  is
         unknown to the Tribunal's procedure.


         On the assumption that the Secretary of State intends  to  concede
         the appeal to the Upper Tribunal  I  now  propose  to  allow  that
         appeal, set aside the determination of  the  First-tier  Tribunal,
         and  direct  a  further  hearing  before   that   Tribunal.    Any
         submissions to the contrary will be considered if received  within
         21 days of the date of this letter."



 2. No response has been received.  I now set aside  the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal for error or law  and  remit  the  appeal  to  that
    Tribunal for determination afresh.








                                                           C. M. G. OCKELTON
                                        VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UPPER TRIBUNAL
                                              IMMIGRATION AND ASYLUM CHAMBER
                                                     Date: 12 November 2018.
