                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria who was born on 8th March 1972.

2.   She made application for leave to remain in the United Kingdom  on  the
    basis of her private life, but her application  was  dismissed  by  the
    Secretary of State on 23rd December 2015 and she therefore appealed  to
    the First-tier Tribunal.

3.   Her appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Pickup,  who  decided
    the appeal without an oral hearing.

4.   The reason the judge decided the appeal  without  an  oral  hearing  is
    because in her Notice of  Appeal,  submitted  by  Crown  and  Law,  she
    indicated that she wanted an oral  hearing.   There  was  on  the  file
    before Judge Pickup a copy of a letter written to the appellant and her
    solicitors on 27th October last advising them that any written evidence
    or submissions they wished to make must be forwarded  to  the  Tribunal
    and to the respondent by 24th November 2016.

5.   Unbeknown to Judge Pickup the appellant's solicitors had  requested  an
    oral hearing and despite having been advised by the Tribunal that  they
    should pay the balance of the ï¿½140 fee no later than 17th October 2016,
    it was not paid until 21st October 2016.  The Tribunal's administration
    failed to bring this to the attention of the judge.

6.   As a result,  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Pickup  decided  the  appeal
    without an oral hearing.

7.   I make no criticism of First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Pickup.   He  should
    have been advised by administration that the appellant had paid the fee
    for an oral hearing and the matter should have  been  listed  for  oral
    hearing.  As a result, the appellant has effectively been denied a fair
    hearing, but  her  solicitors  must  accept  responsibility  for  their
    failings also.

8.   At the hearing before me Mr Harrison quite properly accepted  that  the
    interests of justice require that the  determination  of  Judge  Pickup
    should be set aside and  the  matter  be  remitted  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal to be heard afresh by a judge other than  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Pickup or First-tier Tribunal Judge Adio.

9.   It is my understanding that the appellant wishes  to  call  members  in
    support of her appeal.  No witness statements have been submitted.

10.  I direct that witness statements by the  appellant  and  any  witnesses
    she wishes to call should be submitted to the Tribunal no later than 21
    days before the hearing of the appeal and at the same  time  should  be
    sent to the Home Office Presenting Officers' Unit.  Two hours should be
    allowed for the hearing of the appeal.

No anonymity direction is made.
