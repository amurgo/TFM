Representation:
For the Appellant:     party
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria, born on 6 April  1987.   He  has
    not asked for an anonymity order.

 2. The proceedings arise from  a  decision  by  the  respondent  dated  12
    January 2015, which is primarily a  refusal  to  revoke  a  deportation
    order, but which also "for completeness" adheres to a  decision  of  17
    December 2013, refusing a residence card.

 3. The FtT dismissed the  appellant's  appeal  on  31  March  2015.   That
    decision included a finding that the deportation order was not made  in
    accordance with the law and should be revoked by the  respondent.   The
    respondent has not  challenged  that  aspect  of  the  decision.    The
    appellant appealed to the UT, which allowed his appeal on 16 July 2015,
    setting aside the decision of the FtT and observing that  the  question
    of a residence card remained to be decided by the SSHD,  "applying  the
    discretion contained in regulation 21 ... and  taking  account  of  her
    powers in relation to deportation set against the particular facts  and
    circumstances pertaining to the appellant".

 4. Although the decision was (at least apparently) for the  appellant,  it
    was he and not the SSHD who sought to appeal to the Court  of  Session.
    Permission was refused by the  UT  but  granted  by  the  Court  on  17
    December  2015,  XA94/15,  under  the  "very  unusual  and   particular
    circumstances".  The case comes before the UT  again  pursuant  to  the
    opinion of the Court delivered by the Lord  Justice  Clerk  on  1  June
    2016, [2016] CSIH 39, and to the Court's interlocutor of the same date,
    in terms of which the Lords:

         "... remit the matter to the [UT] and direct  that  the  appeal  is
         heard by a judge different to the judge against whose decision this
         appeal was directed, and all of  the  judges  who  have  previously
         considered the case; further, direct that the [UT] shall  determine
         all of the grounds upon which permission to appeal was  granted  by
         Judge McCarthy in his determination dated 22 April 2015."

 5. The appellant presented his case in person,  with  remarkable  accuracy
    and clarity for an unqualified litigant in person.  I am  obliged  also
    to Mr Matthews  for  his  thorough  and  careful  presentation  of  the
    respondent's side of the case.

 6. The appellant seeks a finding  within  these  proceedings  that  he  is
    entitled to a residence card as the family member of  a  qualified  EEA
    national under regulation 9 of the Immigration (EEA)  Regulations  2006
    ("the regulations").  Alternatively, he seeks a finding that he  has  a
    right to remain in the UK under article 8  of  the  ECHR,  outwith  the
    immigration rules.  It was common ground that the practical task of the
    UT required an answer to those two matters.  I was not asked  to  leave
    the substantive issues for  the  respondent  to  decide,  or  to  frame
    guidance  for  that  purpose.  It  was  also  common  ground  that  the
    deportation  order  formerly  in  force  against  the   appellant   and
    regulations 20 and 21 do not bear on present issues.

 7. Firstly, however, it has to be decided whether the FtT materially erred
    in law.

 8. The grounds of appeal, as extracted by Judge McCarthy, were as follows:

         1 -      misapplication of the  principles  of  Devaseelan  ([2002]
         UKAIT 00702) by adopting findings  from  an  earlier  determination
         that had been set aside;

         2 -      misapplication of ... [transitional  provisions  regarding
         amendment of regulation 9];

         3 -      misapplication of principles set out in Akrich  (C-109/01,
         I-09607, [2004] QB 756) by relying on the appellant's  motives  for
         gaining residence in Germany;

         4 -      misapplication of regulation 9 by taking  account  of  the
         short period  of  time  the  appellant's  British  wife  worked  in
         Germany; and

         5 -      misapplication of article 8 ECHR because the judge  failed
         to take account of the best interests of  the  appellant's  British
         and Irish citizen  child  and  to  carry  out  a  proper  balancing
         exercise ....

 9. Grounds 1 and 2 are  conceded  by  the  SSHD.   The  appellant  and  Mr
    Matthews went on from there to address the merits, applying  regulation
    9 as it stood prior to amendment, so that grounds 3 and 4 became  steps
    on the way to remaking the  decision.   I  return  to  ground  5  after
    considering the case in terms of the regulations.

10. It is also necessary to note proceedings in an earlier  appeal  to  the
    FtT and to the UT, IA/53753/2013, ending with the UT's decision by  the
    UT dated 8 September 2014, stating that the SSHD had failed to reach  a
    decision on whether the deportation order against the appellant  should
    be revoked and thereafter on whether he was  entitled  to  a  residence
    card.  The FtT decision was set aside and the case  was  "remitted"  to
    the SSHD.

11. The SSHD again refused the appellant a residence  card  on  2  November
    2015 (in light of one or  both  of  the  UT's  decisions,  and  of  the
    proceedings in the Court referred  to  in  the  next  paragraph).   The
    appellant sought to appeal, out of time, but has since abandoned  those
    proceedings.   That  matter  is  mentioned  in   the   SSHD's   written
    submissions.  When responding to those, the  appellant  said  that  the
    decision of the Inner House nullified the decision of the  SSHD.   That
    is incorrect.  The Inner House decision has no such  effect.   However,
    the reference in the written submissions by the SSHD is only narrative.
     The decision made on 2 November 2015 stands unappealed, but  that  has
    no bearing on the outcome of these proceedings.

12. By way of petition to the Court, P1251/14, the appellant sought  orders
    compelling the SSHD to  make  a  decision  on  his  application  for  a
    residence card and orders related to refusal to issue a certificate  of
    application (a CoA, which would enable him to work).  The first part of
    his petition was superseded by the decision mentioned  above,  but  the
    second part remains live, and is the subject of the opinion of the Lord
    Ordinary dated 24 November 2015, [2015] CSOH 158.

13. Paragraph 68 of the opinion of the Lord Ordinary finds that  the  Court
    had to decide the regulation 9 point,  "even  though  a  similar  issue
    arises for decision in a slightly  different  context  elsewhere".   At
    paragraph 71 the Court finds "no doubt at  all  that  the  petitioner's
    case satisfies the conditions of regulation 9  as  it  applied  at  the
    time".

14. Mr Aina asked the UT to adopt that finding, which would be the  end  of
    this case; but the respondent does not agree.

15. At paragraph  11  of  its  decision  the  Inner  House  said  that  the
    observations of the Lord Ordinary "... were obiter since the  issue  of
    regulation 9 was not one which the Lord Ordinary had to decide".

16.  Mr  Aina  argued  (with  some  acuity,  and  in  response  to  written
    submissions which he had seen only earlier in the day) that  the  Outer
    House decision turned on what was made of  regulation  9,  and  so  the
    observations were not obiter, but that the comments of the Inner  House
    were obiter to the matter before it, and so not binding on the UT.

17. The decision of the  Outer  House  reaches  its  conclusions  regarding
    regulation 9 as an alternative; see paragraph 67.

18. As Mr Matthews said, a decision  of  the  Outer  House  may  be  highly
    persuasive in the UT, but is not binding.  Only a decision of the Inner
    House is binding.

19. The particular arguments now put to the UT do not appear to  have  been
    advanced in the Outer House.

20. Regulation 9 as in force at the time of application provided thus:

         'Family members of British citizens

         (1)      If the conditions in paragraph (2)  are  satisfied,  these
         regulations apply to a person who is the family member of a  United
         Kingdom national as if the United  Kingdom  national  were  an  EEA
         national.

         (2)      The conditions are that-

             (a) the United Kingdom national is residing in an EEA State as
             a worker or self-employed person or  was  so  residing  before
             returning to the United Kingdom; and

             (b) if the family member of the United Kingdom national is his
             spouse or civil partner, the parties are  living  together  in
             the EEA State or  had  entered  into  the  marriage  or  civil
             partnership and were living together in that State before  the
             United Kingdom national returned to the United Kingdom.

         (3)      Where these regulations apply to the family  member  of  a
         United Kingdom  national  the  United  Kingdom  national  shall  be
         treated as holding a valid passport issued by an EEA State for  the
         purpose of the application of regulation 13 to that family member.'

21. The opinion of the Outer House says at paragraphs 69 - 72:

         "[69]     The  two  decisions  in  the  FTT,  no  doubt  reflecting
         submissions made on behalf of the Secretary of  State,  place  much
         emphasis on the short time which the petitioner  and  his  wife,  a
         Union citizen, spent in Germany  before  returning  to  the  United
         Kingdom, the transient nature of their  residence  there,  and  the
         short time  during  which  they  were  employed.   Those  might  be
         relevant considerations if the matter was  being  considered  under
         Directive 2004/38 in light of the  developing  case  law  from  the
         Court of  Justice.   But  the  EEA  Regulations  set  out  specific
         conditions in Regulation 9(2) which, if satisfied, entitle a family
         member of a United Kingdom national to be treated as if the  United
         Kingdom national were an EEA  national  and,  cutting  through  the
         somewhat intricate steps to reach this result,  would  entitle  the
         petitioner to be issued with  a  residence  card,  subject  to  the
         public policy exception already discussed.  Those conditions, as in
         force at the time, were that (a) the  United  Kingdom  national  is
         residing in an EEA State as a worker or self-employed person or was
         so residing before returning to the United Kingdom; and (b) if  the
         family member of the United Kingdom national is  his  spouse,  that
         they were living together in  that  EEA  State  before  the  United
         Kingdom national returned to the  United  Kingdom.   That  test  is
         fully satisfied in this case.  The petitioner's wife  was  residing
         in Germany as a worker or self-employed person before returning  to
         the United Kingdom.  The petitioner is her  spouse  and  they  were
         living together in Germany before she (and they)  returned  to  the
         United Kingdom.  Nothing more is required.  It  may  well  be  that
         case law  from  the  Court  of  Justice  has  elaborated  upon  the
         circumstances in which residence and employment/self-employment  in
         a Member State of which the Union citizen is not a national  is  or
         is not sufficient in terms of length and  quality  to  entitle  the
         Union citizen to bring his spouse or other family  member  back  to
         his home state when he returns there;  and  it  may  well  be  that
         Regulation 9 has now been amended to attempt to give effect to this
         case law.  But that amendment does not affect the  petitioner,  who
         applied for a residence card before it came into  effect.   Nor  is
         the unamended Regulation to be construed as though it reflected the
         developing jurisprudence from the Court of Justice; if it  were  to
         be construed in this way, there would have been no need to amend it
         in an attempt to give effect to that  case  law.   In  the  result,
         therefore, while factors of the type mentioned  by  Judges  McGrade
         and Bradshaw might well be relevant to  a  claim  brought  directly
         under the Directive, and might be relevant also to a  consideration
         of a claim brought under the terms of the amended Regulation  9  of
         the EEA Regulations, they are not relevant to  a  consideration  of
         whether the petitioner meets the requirements of Regulation 9 as it
         existed at the time of his application and as is applicable to  his
         case.  If  this  means  that  the  domestic  Regulations  are  more
         favourable to the  petitioner  than  the  provisions  of  Directive
         2004/38, so be it.  That is expressly permitted by  article  37  of
         the Directive.

         [70]      There  is,  to  my  mind,  no  doubt  at  all  that   the
         petitioner's case satisfies the conditions of Regulation  9  as  it
         applied at the time.  It is difficult to see any basis  from  which
         he would not  be  entitled  to  a  residence  card  under  the  EEA
         Regulations.

         [71]     Both Judge  McGrade  and  Judge  Bradshaw  questioned  the
         motives of the petitioner and his wife in moving to live  and  work
         in Germany.  Judge McGrade formed the  view  that  "their  stay  in
         Germany was clearly intended to enable them to return to the United
         Kingdom using the Surinder Singh  route."   Judge  Bradshaw  agreed
         with him.  With great respect to both of them, as  pointed  out  by
         Judge McCarthy in granting permission to appeal to the  UT,  it  is
         clear from the decision of the Court of Justice in Akrich that this
         consideration is  irrelevant  to  a  proper  determination  of  the
         petitioner's claim.

         [72]     Accordingly, even if the Secretary of State is correct  in
         saying that the question of whether the petitioners are entitled to
         a CoA is dependent upon the answer  to  whether  he  satisfies  the
         conditions  in  Regulation  9(2)  of  the  EEA  Regulations,  I  am
         satisfied that he  does;  and  there  is  therefore  no  basis  for
         refusing to issue the CoA."

22. The appellant's submission based on Akrich was that  the  motive  which
    may have led a British citizen to move to another member state is of no
    relevance, and must not be taken into account.

23. The most relevant passages in Akrich are these:

         "[55]    ... the motives which may have  prompted  a  worker  of  a
         member state to seek employment in another member state are  of  no
         account as regards his right to enter and reside in  the  territory
         of the latter state provided that he there pursues an effective and
         genuine activity.

         [56]     Nor are such  motives  relevant  in  assessing  the  legal
         situation of the couple at the time of their return to  the  member
         state of which the worker is a national.

         ...

         [61]     ... where the marriage between  a  national  of  a  member
         state and a national of a non-member state  is  genuine,  the  fact
         that the spouses installed themselves in another  member  state  in
         order ... to obtain the benefit of rights  conferred  by  community
         law is not relevant to an assessment of their  legal  situation  by
         the competent authorities of the latter state."

24. Akrich is clear about the irrelevance of motive, but its proviso  about
    "effective and genuine  activity"  seems  to  leave  further  questions
    hanging.

25. On the short period spent by  the  appellant's  wife  in  Germany,  the
    appellant says that community law and regulation 9 set no fixed period.
     He supports this with a passage from the respondent's guidance,  which
    states:

         'The British citizen was not subject to any minima or maxima on how
         long the exercise of treaty rights took place in [the other] member
         state.'

26. That guidance is also clear, as far as it goes; but  it  does  not  say
    that any token exercise of treaty rights will suffice.

27. The respondent founds on O (C-457/12,  [2014]  3  CMLR  17,  [2014]  QB
    1163), and refers in particular  to paragraphs 47 - 58:

         "47      Therefore, an obstacle to  leaving  the  Member  State  of
         which the worker is a national, as mentioned in Singh and Eind,  is
         created by the refusal to confer, when that worker returns  to  his
         Member State of origin, a derived right of residence on the  family
         members of that worker who are third-country nationals, where  that
         worker resided with his family members in  the  host  Member  State
         pursuant to, and in conformity with, Union law.

         48 It is therefore necessary  to  determine  whether  the  case-law
         resulting from Singh and Eind is capable of being applied generally
         to family members of Union citizens who, having availed  themselves
         of the rights conferred on them by Article 21(1) TFEU, resided in a
         Member State other than that of which they  are  nationals,  before
         returning to the Member State of origin.

         49 That is indeed the case. The grant, when a Union citizen returns
         to the Member State of which he is a national, of a  derived  right
         of residence to a third-country national who is a family member  of
         that Union citizen and with whom that citizen has  resided,  solely
         by virtue of  his  being  a  Union  citizen,  pursuant  to  and  in
         conformity with Union law in the host Member State, seeks to remove
         the same type of obstacle on leaving the Member State of origin  as
         that referred to in paragraph 47 above, by guaranteeing  that  that
         citizen will be able, in his Member State of  origin,  to  continue
         the family life which he created or strengthened in the host Member
         State.

         50 So far as concerns the conditions for  granting,  when  a  Union
         citizen returns to the Member State of which he is  a  national,  a
         derived right of residence, based on Article 21(1) TFEU, to a third-
         country national who is a family member of that Union citizen  with
         whom that citizen has resided, solely by  virtue  of  his  being  a
         Union citizen, in the host Member State,  those  conditions  should
         not, in principle, be  more  strict  than  those  provided  for  by
         Directive 2004/38 for the grant of such a right of residence  to  a
         third-country national who is a family member of a Union citizen in
         a case where that citizen has exercised his  right  of  freedom  of
         movement by becoming established in a Member State other  than  the
         Member State of which he  is  a  national.  Even  though  Directive
         2004/38 does not cover such a  return,  it  should  be  applied  by
         analogy to the conditions for the residence of a Union citizen in a
         Member State other than that of which he is a national, given  that
         in both cases it is the Union citizen who is the  sponsor  for  the
         grant of a derived right of residence to a  third-country  national
         who is a member of his family.

         51 An obstacle such as that referred to in paragraph 47 above  will
         arise only where the residence of the Union  citizen  in  the  host
         Member State has been sufficiently genuine so  as  to  enable  that
         citizen to create or strengthen family life in that  Member  State.
         Article 21(1) TFEU does not therefore require that every  residence
         in the host Member State by a Union citizen accompanied by a family
         member who  is  a  third-country  national  necessarily  confers  a
         derived right of residence on that  family  member  in  the  Member
         State of which that citizen is a national upon the citizen's return
         to that Member State.

         52 In that regard, it should be observed that a Union  citizen  who
         exercises his rights under Article 6(1) of Directive  2004/38  does
         not intend to settle in the host Member State in a way which  would
         be such as to create or  strengthen  family  life  in  that  Member
         State. Accordingly,  the  refusal  to  confer,  when  that  citizen
         returns to his Member State of origin, a derived right of residence
         on members of his family who are third-country nationals  will  not
         deter such a citizen from exercising his rights under Article 6.

         53 On the other hand, an obstacle  such  as  that  referred  to  in
         paragraph 47 above may be created where the Union  citizen  intends
         to exercise his rights under Article 7(1)  of  Directive  2004/38.
         Residence in the host Member State pursuant to  and  in  conformity
         with the conditions set out in Article 7(1) of that  directive  is,
         in principle, evidence of settling there and therefore of the Union
         citizen's genuine residence in the host Member State and goes  hand
         in hand with creating and strengthening family life in that  Member
         State.

         54 Where, during the genuine residence of the Union citizen in  the
         host  Member  State,  pursuant  to  and  in  conformity  with   the
         conditions set out in Article 7(1) and (2) of  Directive  2004/38,
         family life is created or strengthened in that  Member  State,  the
         effectiveness of the rights  conferred  on  the  Union  citizen  by
         Article 21(1) TFEU requires that the citizen's family life in  the
         host Member State may continue on returning to the Member of  State
         of which he is a national, through the grant of a derived right  of
         residence to the family member who is a third-country national.  If
         no such derived right of residence were granted, that Union citizen
         could be discouraged from leaving the Member State of which he is a
         national in order to exercise his right of residence under  Article
         21(1) TFEU in another Member State because he is uncertain  whether
         he will be able to continue in his Member State of origin a  family
         life with his immediate family members which has  been  created  or
         strengthened in the host Member State (see, to that  effect,  Eind,
         paragraphs 35 and 36, and Iida, paragraph 70).

         55 A fortiori, the effectiveness of  Article  21(1)  TFEU  requires
         that the Union citizen may continue, on  returning  to  the  Member
         State of which he is a national, the family life which  he  led  in
         the host Member State, if he and the family member concerned who is
         a third-country national have been granted  a  permanent  right  of
         residence in the host Member State pursuant to  Article 16(1)  and
         (2) of Directive 2004/38 respectively.

         56 Accordingly, it is genuine residence in the host Member State of
         the Union citizen and of the family member who is  a  third-country
         national, pursuant to and in conformity with the conditions set out
         in Article 7(1) and (2) and Article 16(1)  and  (2)  of  Directive
         2004/38 respectively, which creates, on the Union citizen's  return
         to his Member State of origin, a derived right of residence, on the
         basis of Article 21(1) TFEU, for the third-country  national  with
         whom that citizen lived as a family in the host Member State.

         57 It is for the referring court to determine whether sponsor O and
         sponsor B, who are both Union  citizens,  settled  and,  therefore,
         genuinely resided in the host Member State and whether, on  account
         of living as a family during  that  period  of  genuine  residence,
         Mr O. and Mr B. enjoyed a derived right of residence in the  host
         Member State pursuant to and in conformity  with  Article  7(2)  or
         Article 16(2) of Directive 2004/38.

         58 It should be added  that  the  scope  of  Union  law  cannot  be
         extended to cover  abuses  (see,  to  that  effect,  Case  C-110/99
         Emsland-St�rke [2000] ECR I-11569, paragraph 51, and Case  C-303/08
         Bozkurt [2010] ECR I-13445, paragraph 47). Proof of such  an  abuse
         requires, first, a combination of objective circumstances in which,
         despite formal observance  of  the  conditions  laid  down  by  the
         European Union rules, the purpose  of  those  rules  has  not  been
         achieved, and, secondly, a subjective  element  consisting  in  the
         intention to obtain an advantage from the European Union  rules  by
         artificially creating the conditions laid  down  for  obtaining  it
         (Case C-364/10 Hungary v Slovakia [2012] ECR, paragraph 58)."

28. I was asked to note also from O at paragraph 60 that  the  grant  of  a
    residence card to the third country national in the host state does not
    require the EU citizen's state   also  to  grant  a  derived  right  of
    residence.

29. The respondent's submissions are as follows.  Akrich does not take  the
    appellant as far as he  contends.   Even  if  an  individual's  motives
    cannot  prevent  their  family  members  from  enjoying  the  right  in
    regulation 9 where they have genuinely resided in  another  EEA  state,
    motives may be relevant  to  the  assessment  whether  or  not  the  UK
    national was "residing" in that state for purpose of regulation 9.   It
    is an error to disregard the case law of the  CJEU  on  the  view  that
    regulation 9 was subsequently amended to give effect to that case  law,
    and that the appellant has the benefit of the bare terms of  regulation
    9.  Rather, regulation 9 in its unamended form was specifically created
    to give effect to the doctrine derived from Surinder Singh C-370/90 ECR
    I-04265, [1992] 3  CMLR  358,  [1993]  Fam  law  294.   It  was  to  be
    interpreted consistently with Surinder Singh and with further cases  in
    that line of authority, including O.  In CPC/4072/2013  (EU  law:  free
    movement) [2014] UKUT 573 (AAC) the UT applied O and B C-456/12 to  the
    unamended regulation 9.  At paragraph 31 the UT noted  the  concern  of
    the Court in O and B with residence that was "sufficiently  genuine  as
    to enable that citizen to create or  strengthen  family  life  in  that
    member state".  The UT thought that "expressly acknowledges a need  for
    a qualitative element, going beyond mere presence".   The  UT  said  at
    paragraph 40:

         "... what is required of the decision maker is to make a  judgement
         of fact and degree as to whether the individual has  lived  in  the
         EEA state in question with sufficient permanence, continuity, or at
         least some expectation of continuity,  to  warrant  the  conclusion
         that he "resided" there within the ordinary meaning of the word."

30. (O and O and B are two separate but parallel cases involving  the  same
    principles, in which the Grand Chamber gave judgement on the same  day,
    12 March 2014.)

31. Applying the above approach to the facts of this  case,  the  SSHD  put
    these principal points, in summary:

           . the FtT looked at the circumstances through both  the  amended
             and unamended regulation and  came  to  the  same  conclusion,
             correctly taking into account the short period of residence of
             appellant and spouse in Germany (4 months by  the  appellant's
             wife);

           . the appellant and his wife  moved  at  least  4  times  within
             Germany,  a  transient  lifestyle   adverse   to   "sufficient
             permanence and continuity" of residence;

           . neither spouse took any steps to learn German;

           . no evidence of any attempts to put down roots in Germany;

           . the FtT was correctly not satisfied  that  appellant's  spouse
             looked for work in Germany prior to 13 July 2012;

           . the employment of the appellant's spouse in Germany was only a
             matter of weeks;

           . it was not relevant  that  a  residence  card  was  issued  in
             Germany to the appellant;

           . the appellant's highly adverse immigration history,  including
             use of deception, and unlawful re-entry to  UK  shortly  after
             being refused entry clearance, were relevant;

           . similarly, his convictions arising from  a  sham  marriage  to
             obtain a previous residence card, and his  agreed  removal  to
             Nigeria in exchange for not serving his sentence;

           . the immigration history and  convictions were "not irrelevant"
             to whether residence in  Germany  was  genuine,  or  at  least
             "coloured the background";

           . the FtT went wrong about Devaseelan principles and in applying
             the centre of life test [from the current regulation  9],  but
             not otherwise in resolving the regulation 9 issue;

           . on  the  correct  legal  approach,  grounds  3  and  4  showed
             disagreement on the facts, rather than error of law;

           . the refusal of a residence card was justified.

32. It must primarily be decided whether  the  correct  legal  approach  to
    regulation 9 (prior to amendment) is as posed by the  appellant  or  by
    the respondent.

33. The appellant's arguments have not persuaded me that the regulation was
    framed so as to be more favourable to those seeking to benefit from  it
    than the Directive from which it derived.

34. I find force in the respondent's argument that  the  case  law  of  the
    CJEU, including O, is relevant to not only to the Directive but also to
    the unamended regulation 9.  The approach to be applied  may  therefore
    be taken from CPC/4072/2013 (EU law: free  movement)  [2014]  UKUT  573
    (AAC).  The regulation is not  to  be  construed  as  strictly  as  the
    appellant  contended,  but  with  the  degree  of  latitude  which  the
    respondent derived from the case law.

35. The appellant's primary proposition has been that he is entitled  to  a
    residence card on the bare terms of regulation 9, irrespective  of  any
    ulterior motives.  On the view I have  taken  of  the  case  law,  that
    proposition cannot be upheld.

36. However, the outcome does not turn  only  on  identifying  the  correct
    legal approach.   Although not argued with the same force and  clarity,
    the appellant also advanced his case on the basis that he and his  wife
    genuinely planned to settle in Germany, but were driven to change their
    plans by force of circumstances.

37. Given the history, it would be na�ve to take the motives  expressed  by
    the appellant and his wife simply at  face  value.   Of  course  it  is
    possible that they intended to settle down in Germany, and were  driven
    out by circumstances, but the proposition must  be  considered  in  the
    full context.  I draw the most likely inference as  to  intention  from
    their actions, not their words.  From the evidence as a whole,  I  have
    no difficulty in finding it more likely than not that the appellant set
    out to use the regulations  to  obtain  an  advantage  by  artificially
    creating the conditions for his purpose.  I find that  neither  he  nor
    his wife lived in Germany with any expectation  of  continuity  in  the
    longer term, so as  to  warrant  a  finding  of  residence  within  the
    ordinary meaning of the word.  The obvious and overwhelming reason  for
    their stay in Germany is that they planned to use it to legitimise  the
    appellant's residence in the UK.

38. I turn to ground 5. Mr Matthews submitted that TY [2015] EWCA Civ  1233
    and Amirteymour [2015] UKUT 466 establish that issues under  article  8
    of the ECHR are irrelevant to an appeal under the regulations,  so  the
    appellant could not succeed on that basis.  Alternatively, he said that
    the FtT  determination,  although  brief  on  the  issue  of  the  best
    interests of the child, disclosed no legal error.

39. On the point of jurisdiction, Mr Aina suggested  an  answer.   He  said
    that the decision under appeal dealt with article 8 so  the  issue  was
    put into play by the respondent, has been considered  open  until  now,
    and should remain so; and that if his case did not  succeed  under  the
    regulations, it should do so under article 8.

40. The appellant's notice of appeal to the  FtT  was  directed,  as  noted
    above,  against  a  decision  which  primarily  refused  to  revoke   a
    deportation order, but which also  "for  completeness"  adhered  to  an
    earlier decision, refusing a  residence  card.   The  earlier  decision
    advised the appellant that any claim based on family and  private  life
    should be made by separate application,  although  the  later  decision
    touched upon  family  and  private  life  issues  as  an  exception  to
    deportation.  As matters have developed, deportation is  no  longer  in
    issue, only the question of a residence  card.   The  outcome  on  that
    point does not of itself require the appellant to  leave  the  UK.   It
    raises no question of  disproportionate  interference  with  rights  to
    family and private life.  Ground 5 therefore shows no  material  error.
    The appeal, as brought to the FtT,  could  not  succeed  on  article  8
    grounds.

41. In the alternative, I detect no error in the reasoning and  conclusions
    of the FtT.  The appellant has genuine relationships with his wife, who
    is a UK citizen, and with their son, born  in  Ireland  on  5  December
    2012.  The child is a citizen of both the UK and Ireland (perhaps  also
    of Nigeria).  Taking account of the child's best interests, there is no
    reason not to  expect  that  he  will  be  well  looked  after  by  his
    intelligent and resourceful parents, in whichever  country  the  family
    may reside.  It  would  not  be  unreasonable  to  expect  the  child's
    departure from the UK, in family, under all the  circumstances  of  the
    case.  There is nothing disproportionate about expecting the  appellant
    to leave, if it is to be assumed that the law may so require.   It  has
    not been suggested that anything material has changed since  this  case
    was heard in the FtT, so in remaking the  decision,  the  same  outcome
    would be reached.

42. In summary, then, grounds 1 and 2 of the appeal to  the  UT  have  been
    conceded.  They are so material as to require the decision  to  be  set
    aside, on all aspects from which those points cannot be extricated.  It
    is unnecessary to calibrate the extent and materiality of  error  shown
    by grounds 3 and 4.   They  are  subsumed  into  the  remaking  of  the
    decision.  In that process, the appellant has  not  shown  that  he  is
    entitled to a residence card.  Ground 5 shows no material error, but in
    any event the issue of a right to remain under article 8  of  the  ECHR
    does not now arise.

43. The determination of the UT dated 16 July 2015 has been  set  aside  by
    the Court.

44. The decision of the FtT,  dated  and  promulgated  on  31  March  2015,
    stands, to the extent that it found that the  respondent's  deportation
    order of 6 April 2011 was not made in accordance with the law.   In  so
    far as it dismissed the appeal on other grounds, it is  set  aside  and
    the following decision  is  substituted:  the  appellant's  appeal,  as
    originally brought to the FtT, is dismissed under the Immigration (EEA)
    Regulations 2006 and on human rights grounds.
