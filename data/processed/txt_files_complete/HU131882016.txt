Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr R Jesurum of Counsel, instructed by Garth Coates
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant, who is a citizen of Nigeria, seeks to appeal  against  a
    decision of the respondent of 4th April 2016 refusing  her  application
    for entry clearance in the United Kingdom as a partner  under  Appendix
    FM of the Immigration Rules.  An application for entry clearance  as  a
    spouse had been made on 11th January 2016.

2.   Refusal was made essentially on the  basis  that  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer did not accept that the relationship with  the  sponsor  was  a
    genuine and subsisting one or that  there  was  an  intention  to  live
    together  permanently  in  the  United  Kingdom.   Furthermore  it  was
    suggested that there was a lack of evidence to show that there would be
    adequate maintenance for the appellant and her partner without recourse
    to public funds.

3.   The appeal came to be heard by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Walker  on
    17th July 2017.  It was noted that the sponsor had significant learning
    disabilities and that was a matter very much borne in mind by the Judge
    in the course of the determination.

4.   The Judge found that indeed the relationship was  subsisting  and  that
    there was an intention to  live  together  permanently  in  the  United
    Kingdom.

5.   In terms of maintenance it was also noted that the sponsor  was  exempt
    from meeting the requirements of  paragraph  E-ECP.3.1  as  he  was  in
    receipt of disability living allowance.   The  sponsor  had  an  income
    source of �116.32 per week  consisting  of  his  earnings,  DLA  and  a
    savings element.  The income support equivalent calculation was �114.85
    per week.

6.    It  was  noted  at  paragraph  29  of  the  determination   that   the
    accommodation was being provided by the uncle and that that would be at
    no charge to  the  sponsor  or  appellant.   The  Judge  accepted  that
    evidence.

7.   However, the Judge  noted  that  the  uncle's  rent  was  paid  for  or
    contributed to by housing benefit and that  he  also  received  pension
    credits to supplement  his  state  pension.   Thus  the  household  was
    supported by public funds received by the uncle.  The Judge noted  that
    the extent of that support was not known and there  was  a  possibility
    that if the appellant moved into the  property  this  would  alter  the
    situation so far as public funds were concerned.  The Judge found  that
    there would be a possibility that there would be further and additional
    recourse to public funds and on that narrow basis upheld the refusal in
    respect of the Immigration Rules.

8.   The Judge went on also to dismiss  matters  so  far  as  Article  8  is
    concerned.

9.   Appeal was made against that decision on the basis  that  the  comments
    made by the Judge as to  the  possibility  of  further  and  additional
    recourse to public funds were unduly speculative and indeed unfair.

10.  The clear evidence was  that  the  sponsor  satisfied  the  maintenance
    requirements.  This was not a case  where  the  sponsor  was  receiving
    housing benefit, in which case clearly an extra person in the household
    may affect that calculation.  Rather it was a third party,  namely  the
    sponsor's uncle, who received that housing allowance.  There is nothing
    to indicate that he received it otherwise than for himself.

11.  Reliance is placed upon the wording of paragraph 6A of the  Immigration
    Rules, which reads as follows:

         "For the purpose of these Rules, a person (P) is not to be regarded
         as having (or potentially having) recourse to public  funds  merely
         because P is (or will be) reliant in whole or  in  part  on  public
         funds provided to P's sponsor unless, as a result of  P's  presence
         in the United Kingdom, the sponsor is (or  would  be)  entitled  to
         increased or additional public funds (save where  such  entitlement
         to increased or additional public funds is by virtue of P  and  the
         sponsor's joint  entitlement  to  benefits  under  the  Regulations
         referred to in paragraph 6B)."


12.  It is submitted that the focus was clearly on public funds provided  to
    the sponsor and in this case no such funds were provided.

13.  Reliance is also placed upon paragraph 6C  of  the  Immigration  Rules,
    which provides:

         "A person (P) making an application from outside the United Kingdom
         will be regarded as having recourse to public funds where P  relies
         upon the future entitlement to  any  public  funds  that  would  be
         payable to P or to P's sponsor as a result of P's presence  in  the
         United Kingdom (including those benefits to which P or the  sponsor
         would be entitled as a result of P's presence in the United Kingdom
         under the Regulations referred to in to paragraph 6B)."


14.  That also would seem to indicate that it is  the  person  or  sponsor's
    entitlement to public funds, funds payable to  the  person  or  his/her
    sponsor.  The sponsor in the present case is  not  entitled  to  or  is
    being paid any public funds for his housing.

15.  Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was granted and  the  matter
    comes before me to determine the issue.

16.  Mr Bramble's response to the passages in 6A and 6C  of  the  Rules  was
    that as the third party was supporting  the  sponsor  the  third  party
    should also be regarded as a sponsor for the purpose of the Rules.   He
    was, however, unable to point to any aspect of  the  Immigration  Rules
    which supported that contention.

17.  The sponsor in this present case has no entitlement to housing  benefit
    nor indeed is there any indication that he has sought to claim it.  The
    sponsorship undertaking, which is to be found at  page  58,  highlights
    that it is for the uncle to be responsible for the maintenance  of  the
    sponsor without recourse to public funds.  There is nothing to indicate
    that the  sponsor's  presence  in  the  uncle's  household  at  present
    contributes in any way to an increased benefit to the uncle.  In  those
    circumstances, it is  unlikely  that  the  appellant's  presence  would
    further increase that matter.  It seems to me and I so find that it  is
    speculation and no more on the part of the Judge.  A clear statement of
    the uncle, which is to be found at page 85 of the bundle, is  that  the
    sponsor, his nephew, has been living with him in the address since 2007
    and that if the appellant lived at the residence, the uncle  would  pay
    all utility bills and costs associated with her presence.

18.  I find therefore that the approach taken by the Judge to the  issue  of
    maintenance was unduly speculative  in  the  face  of  what  was  clear
    evidence that the maintenance requirement was  satisfied,  such  as  to
    amount to an error of law.

19.  Accordingly I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge.

20.  What is apparent from the findings of the Judge is  that,  contrary  to
    the assertion in the Entry Clearance Officer's refusal, the marriage is
    subsisting and satisfies the  ingredients  of  the  Immigration  Rules.
    Similarly, I fin, upon the basis of  fact  as  accepted  by  the  Judge
    including the evidence of the uncle, which was found  to  be  credible,
    that the financial requirements are also satisfied so as  to  meet  the
    Rules.

21.  If indeed the Rules are met then it is unnecessary further to  consider
    Article 8 but, in any event, it would clearly  be  disproportionate  to
    deny entry clearance to someone who in effect meets the Rules.

22.  My attention was drawn to the decision in Greenwood (No. 2)  (para  398
    considered) [2015] UKUT 00629  (IAC),  determined  in  September  2015,
    which recognises that there is no power to remit to  the  Secretary  of
    State.

23.  In the light of such findings of fact it is clear that the decision  of
    the Entry Clearance Officer was made upon an incorrect understanding of
    the reality, of the genuineness of the relationship and of the  ability
    of the sponsor to  satisfy  the  maintenance  requirements.   In  those
    circumstances, the decision was unlawful.

24.  This appeal is allowed to the extent that a lawful decision remains  to
    be made by the Entry Clearance Officer in the light of the findings  of
    fact that have been made by the Tribunal.

Notice of Decision

The appeal is allowed to the extent that a lawful  decision  is  outstanding
to be made.

No anonymity direction is made.
