                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, [CN], date of birth [ ] 1944, is a citizen of Nigeria.

 2. This is his appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Mather promulgated  14.4.15,  dismissing  on  all  grounds  his  appeal
    against the decision of the  Secretary  of  State,  dated  26.9.14,  to
    refuse his asylum, humanitarian protection  and  human  rights  claims.
    The Judge heard the appeal on 31.3.15.

 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Parkes  refused  permission  to  appeal  on
    8.5.15.  However,  when  the  application  was  renewed  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, Deputy Upper Tribunal  Judge  Murray  granted  permission  to
    appeal on 23.7.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 16.8.16 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. For the reasons summarised below I found no error of law in the  making
    of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal as to require  the  decision
    of Judge Mather should be set aside.

 6. The relevant background can be summarised as  follows.  The  appellant,
    now  72  years  of  age,  is  of  Igbo  ethnicity  and  comes  from   a
    distinguished family in Nigeria. He is well-educated in the UK and  the
    USA and has served in  both  high  commercial  and  government  office,
    including as an economist in the government of President  Obasanjo.  He
    has made numerous recent visa visits to the UK. However, when  he  came
    to the UK in early 2004 he overstayed the 6-months limit of  his  visa.
    He did not claim asylum until August 2013. In  interview  he  explained
    that President Obasanjo told him that on account of  his  ethnicity  he
    would not be reappointed or put forward as a presidential candidate. He
    claimed asylum because, he said "the misfortune of  illness"  made  him
    realise he could not go back to Nigeria. He has incurred  some  �10,000
    in NHS fees for treatment in relation to his diabetes. His family fears
    that if it became known that an Igbo had been passed over for important
    position in the government, there would be mayhem. He does not want the
    MASSOB movement, which believes  that  Biafra  should  exist  alongside
    Nigeria, to use his rejection at being a presidential  candidate  as  a
    trigger for civil war. He claims to have been in hiding in the UK.

 7. The grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal contend that  Judge  Mather
    gave no reasons why he attached little weight to an affidavit from  the
    appellant's family, which had stated that the appellant  was  at  risk,
    particularly in view of  the  positive  credibility  findings  made  in
    relation to the appellant.  The  grounds  further  contend  that  Judge
    Mather erred in carrying out internet  search  after  the  hearing  and
    failed to give either party an opportunity to comment.

 8. Further, the grounds contend that the judge failed to adequately assess
    the risk to the appellant on return. It is also argued that  the  judge
    failed to adequately consider paragraph 276ADE and Article 8 ECHR,  and
    failed to consider the risk to the appellant as a failed asylum  seeker
    returning to Nigeria.

 9. In granting permission to appeal,  Judge  Murray  considered  that  the
    grounds disclosed arguable errors of law. No reasons had been given  at
    �18 for attaching little weight to the "self-serving affidavit said  to
    be sent from the appellant's family." Judge Murray  considered  it  was
    incumbent on the judge to give  reasons  for  rejecting  this  arguably
    material evidence.

10. I have carefully considered the supposed affidavit. It is  not  in  any
    true sense an  affidavit  and  is  not  sworn  before  any  witness  or
    independent authority. It is simply signed over a postage stamp. It  is
    signed by Augustine Osuagwu, on behalf of "family deponents,"  said  to
    be the elders of the Amanze Njoku Ndudu family of Imo  State.  It  does
    not provide any objective evidence. It begins that  the  family  elders
    have provided evidence to the appellant that  through  their  (unnamed)
    intelligence sources they are able to confirm that his name is still on
    the security list. It  claims  that  he  is  at  risk  because  of  the
    government's zero tolerance of any organised dissent.  It  also  claims
    that but for President Obasanjo's hatred of Igbos, the appellant  would
    now be President of Nigeria.

11. Judge Mather was correct to  describe  the  document  as  self-serving.
    Taken at its highest, it can add little, if anything to the appellant's
    case. The document is an entirely speculative and subjective assertion,
    based on undisclosed sources, described  as  "intelligence."  That  the
    appellant himself was found to be broadly credible does not bear to any
    material degree on the weight to be given to  the  supposed  affidavit.
    President Obasanjo is no longer in power and there is  no  credible  or
    satisfactory evidence that anyone in the  current  government  has  any
    adverse interest in the appellant, and there is no  evidence  that  any
    member of his family has been mistreated.

12. The appellant's asylum claim is itself entirely speculative,  based  on
    his claim to have been passed over for government political office,  in
    his opinion, and that indirectly if it were known that an Igbo had been
    passed over in this way there would be civil war in Nigeria. MASSOB  is
    a legitimate and recognised political movement and not  a  military  or
    militant organisation.

13. Taking the affidavit in the context of the evidence and the appellant's
    claim as a whole, there is little more that the judge could  or  should
    have said about the affidavit and the scant weight attributed to it. It
    is inevitable that had  the  judge  spent  any  longer  addressing  the
    document, the ultimate conclusion would have  been  the  same.  In  the
    circumstances, no material error is disclosed by the brief treatment at
    �18 of the First-tier Tribunal decision.

14. Further, Judge Murray found that at �22 the judge had conducted his own
    internet research after the hearing and considered this evidence in the
    risk assessment, without giving the parties the opportunity to comment,
    contrary to the guidance in EG (post-hearing internet research) Nigeria
    [2008] 00015.

15. I find no material error  in  relation  to  the  post-hearing  internet
    research ground of appeal. At �22 the judge noted that in his interview
    the appellant had invited the respondent to 'Google' him. In doing  so,
    the judge noted only that the appellant had provided  a  full  blog  in
    March 2011 and continued to write books openly. I fail to see how  that
    information was material to the adverse decision. If anything,  it  was
    consistent with the appellant's own case. I  find  that  whilst  it  is
    unwise to conduct such post-hearing internet research, on the facts  of
    this case nothing of any materiality turns on the information disclosed
    in such research. Mr Howard was unable  to  point  me  to  any  adverse
    finding or conclusion that could  have  been  contributed  to  by  such
    research. The ground is not more than  a  technical  objection  without
    positive merit.

16. The third ground of appeal is  that  the  judge  failed  to  adequately
    address the risk on return. In particular,  it  is  asserted  that  the
    judge failed to address the appellant's ethnicity, accepted at  �27  of
    the refusal decision as being Igbo. However, both the refusal  decision
    and the decision of the First-tier Tribunal accepted that the appellant
    had been passed over for further political office because of  his  Igbo
    ethnicity. The appellant's case is that he does not fear anyone in  the
    current  Nigerian  regime,  nor  has  his   family   been   mistreated,
    threatened, or in any other way adversely  affected.  Being  overlooked
    for presidential candidacy because of his ethnicity does not amount  to
    a well-founded fear of persecution or real risk of serious harm. As the
    Secretary of  State  concluded,  his  fear  is  not-well  founded,  but
    entirely subjective, and I may add speculative  in  that  he  believes,
    without any evidential foundation, that MASSOB would  protest  that  an
    Igbo had been passed over and somehow initiate a civil war.  The  claim
    appears to be entirely fanciful in the mind of the appellant.  He  does
    not claim that his Igbo ethnicity has caused or would give rise to  any
    personal mistreatment. The whole claim suggests a rather  over-inflated
    sense of  his  own  importance.  In  the  circumstances,  there  is  no
    foundation, even on the appellant's case, for a  real  risk  on  return
    arising from his ethnicity. Again, a rather technical  point  is  being
    taken, without merit.

17. The fourth ground complains that at �25 there was inadequate  treatment
    of the appellant's private life claim under  paragraph  276ADE  of  the
    Immigration Rules, the judge merely stating that he fails to  meet  the
    requirements. However, Mr Howard was unable to point to  anything  that
    might be considered to be very significant obstacles to his integration
    in  Nigeria,  where  he  speaks  the  language,  has  extensive  family
    connections and support, and where he has spent  the  majority  of  his
    life. He clearly has retained family, social and cultural ties, even if
    he has been living illegally in the UK since 2005. It is  obvious  that
    the appellant cannot meet the requirements of the immigration rules and
    it follows that there is no material error in the judge doing  no  more
    than stating the obvious. The Tribunal is not required  to  set  out  a
    full treatise of every potential issue, regardless of the merits.  Once
    again, this is no more than an attempt to pick holes in the decision in
    order to try and cobble together some foundation to reargue the appeal.
    The ground has no merit.

18. Finally, it  is  complained  that  the  judge  failed  to  address  the
    appellant's risk on return  as  a  failed  asylum-seeker  returning  to
    Nigeria. I agree that it was not addressed  in  the  refusal  decision.
    However, it was not an issue relied on at the  First-tier  Tribunal  by
    the appellant and there is no material  error  in  not  addressing  it.
    Again, Mr Howard was unable to point to any evidence  to  suggest  that
    the appellant might be at such a risk, even to the  lower  standard  of
    proof.

19. Taken either individually or as a whole, the grounds of appeal fail  to
    identify any material error in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.



Conclusions:

20. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

                    I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed on all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order.

Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.

Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable and thus no fee award can be made.
