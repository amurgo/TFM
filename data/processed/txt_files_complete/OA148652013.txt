For the Appellant:     Mr P. Deller, Senior Presenting Officer
For the Respondent/Claimant:    None

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Specialist Appeals Team appeals on behalf  of  an  Entry  Clearance
    Officer (Manila) from the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  allowing
    the claimant's appeal against the refusal of  entry  clearance  as  the
    spouse of a British national.

 2. The appellant is a national of Australia, whose date  of  birth  is  20
    June 1981.  He made an online application for  entry  clearance  on  30
    April 2013.   He  was  married  to  Amy  Alexandra  Loxton,  a  British
    national, who was living with him in Australia.  They had had one child
    Kobe, who had been born on 16 May 2012.  They proposed to live  in  the
    UK with his wife's mother in Dorset.  He was asked whether he  intended
    to work in the UK.  He answered yes.  He and his wife intended to buy a
    business, and they were currently looking at buying a country pub.  His
    wife was currently working as a nurse at Gold Coast Hospital,  and  had
    been doing so since 1 May 2008.  She earned �30,000 sterling equivalent
    from this employment before tax.  They owned three properties together,
    and had large cash savings.  In answer to question 3.75, he  said  that
    he had 60,000 Australian dollars in an  account  which  had  been  held
    since January 2012, and  the  total  cash  savings  held  by  his  wife
    amounted to �45,000.  They were looking to return to the UK so that his
    wife's family could spend some time with their little boy, who had dual
    citizenship.

The Reasons for Refusal

 3. On 20 June 2013 an Entry Clearance Officer in Manila gave  his  reasons
    for  refusing  the  application.   In  order  to  meet  the   financial
    requirements of the Rules, his wife needed a gross income of  at  least
    �18,600 per annum.  As his wife was returning to the UK,  she  did  not
    have to be in employment at the point of application.  But she  had  to
    have confirmed salaried employment to return to the UK, starting within
    three months of her return.  The  employment  had  to  have  an  annual
    starting salary sufficient to meet the financial requirement applicable
    to the application.  In addition, he also needed to demonstrate that in
    the twelve months prior to his application his sponsor had received the
    level of income specified to meet the financial  requirement  based  on
    salaried income overseas, non-employment income and/or pensions.

 4. He had not provided evidence to  demonstrate  his  wife  had  confirmed
    employment in the UK starting within  three  months  of  her  returning
    there.  Indeed he had indicated in Appendix 2 that  his  wife  did  not
    have any employment  arranged  in  the  UK.   Therefore,  in  order  to
    qualify, his wife was required to show �62,500 in savings,  which  must
    have been held for at least six months.

 5. As evidence of his savings, he had provided a bank statement from  RAMS
    covering a period from 1 October 2012 to 31  March  2013.   The  lowest
    balance in the last six months was 19,671 Australian dollars, which was
    equivalent to �12,642 according to  OANDA.   Therefore,  these  savings
    were not sufficient to meet the  financial  requirements.   Accordingly
    his application was refused under paragraph EC-C.1.1(d) of Appendix  FM
    of the Immigration Rules.

The Grounds of Appeal

 6. The claimant wrote a letter in which he set out his grounds of  appeal.
    He had not realised that they needed to show proof  of  employment  for
    his wife in the UK.  During the pending visa application, his wife  had
    been in contact with a possible employer that she had met  in  December
    2012 whilst back home in the UK on  holiday.   She  was  successful  at
    interview, and he was attaching supporting documents to show  that  she
    had employment which was supposed was to commence in August 2013.

 7. He disputed the Entry Clearance Officer's assertion  that  he  had  not
    demonstrated that in the last twelve months his wife had  received  the
    level of income required.  They had submitted a 2012 income tax  return
    for both himself and his wife  which  showed  that  she  earned  65,921
    Australian dollars (approximately �44,000) for the year.

 8. He and his wife had three houses here in  Australia,  and  they  had  a
    healthy savings account.  The reason for them  not  having  appropriate
    savings for the entire time required was purely a matter  of  shuffling
    money around from bank to bank.  It  was  not  until  March  2013  they
    definitely decided they would like to move to  the  UK,  so  all  their
    money was not in one account.  They also needed to sell their  boat  to
    help finance their move.

The Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

 9. The appellant's appeal came before Judge Nixon sitting at Birmingham on
    20 February 2014 for determination on the papers.   In  his  subsequent
    determination, Judge Nixon said he had seen a letter dated 9 July  2013
    from Kia Smith of Kiki's Boutique stating a job offer was made  to  the
    sponsor prior to the date of decision, namely on 29 May 2013.  She  was
    offering her a job with an annual salary  of  �20,400  to  commence  in
    August 2013 or as soon as her husband got a visa.  The judge continued:

         This letter fulfils the criteria I am surprised to  note  that  the
         ECM was provided with this letter but seems to ignore  it.   Whilst
         it is  correct  to  state  the  [claimant]  has  not  provided  the
         necessary documents as specified by the Rules to show the sponsor's
         annual income in Australia, it is unnecessary in any event, as  the
         letter provided meets the requirements under the  Rules  and  shows
         that the sponsor is earning sufficient to meet the Rules.   Whether
         or not the couple have sufficient  savings  is  irrelevant  as  the
         gross annual income is over �18,600.  I find that this appeal  must
         succeed.

The Application for Permission to Appeal

10. A member of the Specialist Appeals  Team  settled  an  application  for
    permission to appeal, contending that the judge  had  made  a  material
    misdirection of law:

      a) The Rules on specified evidence  are  comprehensively  set  out  in
         Appendix FM-SE of the Immigration Rules; these set out  what  types
         of evidence are required, the periods they  cover  and  the  format
         they should be in.  The judge fails to have adequate regard to this
         Appendix in making  findings  on  this  issue  and,  as  such,  the
         conclusions arrived at are unsustainable.

      b) The judge indicates that  the  letter  provided  by  the  sponsor's
         employer is sufficient to establish the Immigration Rules are  met.
         It is respectfully submitted that this conclusion is misguided  and
         the judge has erred by failing to  consider  the  totality  of  the
         evidence provided (or, indeed, not provided) in assessing the Rules

      c) It follows from this that it is not clear what the sponsor's actual
         gross annual income was at the date of application; it then follows
         the appeal can therefore not be made out.  It is worth noting  that
         if the sponsor's current income does exceed  the  income  threshold
         there is nothing to prevent  the  appellant  from  making  a  fresh
         application based on the sponsor's income at the present time.

The Grant of Permission

11. On 20 March 2014 First-tier Tribunal Judge Davidge granted  permission,
    observing that the grounds revealed an arguable material error of law.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

12. At the hearing in the Upper Tribunal there was no appearance on  behalf
    of the claimant, nor had any representations been received by the Upper
    Tribunal from him following the grant  of  permission  to  appeal.   Mr
    Deller submitted that the decision was clearly erroneous  in  law,  and
    that the appeal could not succeed due to the failure by the claimant to
    provide all the specified documents in accordance with Appendix FM-SE.

Reasons for Finding an Error of Law

13. The judge misdirected himself  in  holding  that  the  only  evidential
    requirement that the claimant needed to discharge was to show  that  at
    the date of decision his wife had a confirmed offer  of  employment  in
    the United Kingdom which would yield  an  annual  income  of  at  least
    �18,600.

14. The financial requirements for entry clearance as a partner are set out
    in E-ECP.3.1.  The applicant must provide specified evidence, from  the
    sources listed in paragraph E-ECP.3.2,  of  a  specified  gross  annual
    income of at least �18,600.

15.  E-ECP.3.2  provides  that  when  determining  whether  the   financial
    requirement is met, only the  following  sources  will  be  taken  into
    account -

         (a)  income of the  partner  from  specified  employment  or  self-
             employment, which, in respect of a partner returning to the UK
             with the applicant, can include specified employment or  self-
             employment overseas and in the UK; and...

         (e)  specified savings of the applicant and partner.

16. Paragraph 13 of Appendix FM-SE is entitled  "Calculating  gross  annual
    income under Appendix FM."  Paragraph 13(a) prescribes that  where  the
    person is in salaried employment in the UK at the date  of  application
    and has been employed by  their  current  employer  for  at  least  six
    months, their gross annual income will be the total of

         (i)   the  level  of  gross  annual  salary  relied  upon  in   the
    application ...

17.  Paragraph  13(c)  provides  that  where  the  person  is  in  salaried
    employment outside of the UK at  the  date  of  application,  has  been
    employed by their current employer for at  least  six  months,  and  is
    returning to the UK to take up salaried employment in the  UK  starting
    within three months of their return, the person's gross  annual  income
    will be calculated:

         (i)  on the  basis  set  out  in  paragraph  13(a);  and  also  (my
    emphasis)

         (ii) on that basis but substituting for the gross annual salary  at
             paragraph 13(a)(i) the gross annual salary  and  the  salaried
             employment in the UK to which they are returning.

18. Paragraph 2 of Appendix FM-SE provides  that  in  respect  of  salaried
    employment in the UK all of the following evidence must be provided

         (a)  payslips covering

             (i)  a period of six months prior to the date  of  application
                  if a person has been employed by  their  current  employer
                  for at least six months ...

         (b)  a letter  from  the  employers  who  issued  the  payslips  at
             paragraph 2(a) confirming:

             (i)  the person's employment and gross annual salary,

             (ii) the length of their employment;

             (iii)    the period over which they have been or were paid the
                  level of salary relied upon in the application; and

             (iv) the type of employment (permanent, fixed-term contract or
             agency).

         (c)  personal bank statements corresponding to the same periods  as
             the payslips at paragraph 2(a) showing that  salary  has  been
             paid into an account in the name of the person or in the  name
             of the person and their partner jointly.

19. Paragraph 2(a) provides that in respect of salaried employment  in  the
    UK the applicant  may,  in  addition  to  payslips  and  personal  bank
    statements submit the P60 for the relevant periods of employment relied
    upon (if issued).  If they do  not,  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  or
    Secretary of State may grant the application of otherwise  satisfy  the
    requirements of this Appendix relating to that employment are met.

20. Paragraph 3 of Appendix FM-SE provides as follows

         In respect of salaried  employment  outside  of  the  UK,  evidence
         should be a reasonable equivalent to that set out  in  paragraph  2
         and where relevant paragraph 2(a).

21. In respect of a job offer in the UK, a letter from the employer must be
    provided:

          a) Confirming the job offer, the  gross  annual  salary  and  the
             starting date of the employment which  must  be  within  three
             month's of the applicant's partner's return to the UK; or

          b) Enclosing a signed contract of employment which  must  have  a
             starting date within three months of the applicant's partner's
             return to the UK.

22. As asserted in the refusal of entry clearance, the claimant  needed  to
    demonstrate that in the relevant period prior to  his  application  his
    sponsor had  received  the  level  of  income  specified  to  meet  the
    financial requirement based on salaried income overseas, non-employment
    income and/or pensions.  The judge accepted that the claimant  had  not
    provided the necessary documents as specified by the Rules to show  the
    sponsor's annual income in Australia.  On that basis, he ought to  have
    held that the appeal had to  be  dismissed.   He  was  wrong  to  treat
    compliance with this requirement as unnecessary.  As I have  sought  to
    demonstrate above, the Rules required specified evidence to  show  that
    the sponsor was achieving the required level of annual income overseas,
    as well as showing that the sponsor would achieve the required level of
    annual income in the UK.

The Re-Making of the Decision

23. In his grounds of appeal, the claimant argued that  his  wife's  annual
    income in Australia was shown by  their  2012  income  tax  return  for
    himself and wife.  But even if this is treated as equivalent to a  P60,
    it is apparent from paragraph 2(a) of Appendix FM-SE that this type  of
    evidence is merely optional.  As stated by the Entry Clearance  Manager
    when giving reasons for upholding the refusal  decision,  the  claimant
    did not provide payslips or  bank  statements  to  support  his  wife's
    asserted annual income in Australia.  So the First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    was right to hold that the claimant  had  not  provided  the  specified
    documents to show his wife's annual income in Australia.

24. Arguably the Entry Clearance Manager was  not  required  to  take  into
    account the job offer, as the document had not been provided  with  the
    application.  Moreover, as noted in the refusal decision, the  claimant
    had not relied in the application on his wife having such a job  offer.
    Instead, he plainly represented that  what  was  in  contemplation  was
    himself and his wife setting up a business in  the  UK.   However,  the
    Entry Clearance Manager was prepared to take the job offer at its  face
    value, and Mr Deller does not invite me to disregard it.

25. Nonetheless, having failed to provide specified evidence  to  show  the
    sponsor's annual income in Australia, the only other way in  which  the
    appeal can succeed is if the claimant can show that he and/or his  wife
    held the sum of �62,500 for a continuous six month  period  as  at  the
    date of application or at  least  as  at  the  date  of  decision.   As
    contended by the Entry Clearance Manager in his review, the  additional
    documents provided by the claimant for the purposes of the  appeal  did
    not demonstrate that the claimant, or the couple, had held  this  level
    of savings for a continuous six month period.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained an error of  law,  and  it
is accordingly set aside and the following  decision  is  substituted:  this
appeal   against   the   refusal   of   entry   clearance   is    dismissed.


Anonymity


The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule  45(4)(i)  of
