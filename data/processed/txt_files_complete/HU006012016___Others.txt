                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   On 25th April 2015 the first-named appellant made  an  application  for
    leave  to  remain  under  the  provisions  of  paragraph  276B  of  the
    Immigration  Rules,  on  the  basis  that  he  had  spent   ten   years
    continuously and lawfully in the United Kingdom.  The other  appellants
    are dependants upon that claim.  The application was  refused  on  15th
    December 2015 on the basis that his presence in the United Kingdom  was
    not  conducive  to  the  public  good  because  his  conduct  made   it
    undesirable that he remain in the United Kingdom.

2.    The  conduct  complained  of  was  essentially  that,  in  a  previous
    application to be a Tier  1  Migrant  made  in  2011,  the  first-named
    appellant inflated his  earnings  so  as  to  deceive  the  immigration
    authorities as to his  overall  earnings,  alternatively  that  he  had
    failed to declare significant earnings to  Her  Majesty's  Revenue  and
    Customs.  In the  decision  of  15th  December  2015  his  conduct  was
    considered in the alternative.  It was the view of  the  respondent  in
    that decision that on either view the conduct was such that it would be
    undesirable for him to remain in the United Kingdom.

3.   In essence the first-named appellant claimed  that  his  earnings  from
    1st February 2010 to 31st January 2011 were  some  �50,547.   That  was
    made up of his employment with DNC  UK  Services  and  with  McDonald's
    which came to approximately �18,257.  There was further employment from
    self-employment  by  way  of  receiving  dividends  from  shares  which
    amounted to �32,290.  That employment had been of limited duration  and
    was not repeated.  What was  declared  to  Her  Majesty's  Revenue  and
    Customs for the requisite period was in the order of �17,000 to �18,000
    to reflect a slight overlap between accounting years.  The  explanation
    offered by the first-named appellant for that matter was  that  he  had
    given the papers to his then accountant to prepare  the  necessary  tax
    returns and the omission  to  declare  the  �32,290  to  Her  Majesty's
    Revenue and Customs  was  entirely  due  to  the  accountant.   Shortly
    afterwards the accountancy firm went out of business, as can  be  shown
    from the company records, and accordingly it has not been  possible  to
    find that accountant or to  clarify  the  situation.   The  first-named
    appellant however made contact with HMRC and by agreement has made good
    the outstanding tax on that sum.

4.   The first-named appellant sought to appeal against the decision,  which
    appeal came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Turnock for hearing on 1st
    December 2016.  In a determination of 6th January 2017 the  appeal  was
    dismissed, essentially on the basis set out  in  paragraph  49  of  the
    decision, that the earnings provided to the Home Office in  support  of
    the application in February  2011  were  false  and  were  deliberately
    misleading.  The  grounds  of  challenge  contend  that  there  was  an
    erroneous finding of dishonesty that the Judge had not fully considered
    all matters.  Indeed, it was contended that the Judge erred  in  simply
    finding matters on one basis without considering the alternative basis.

5.   Permission to appeal was  granted  on  the  basis  that  there  was  no
    indication that consideration had been given to the further payment  to
    HMRC of the additional tax and findings  on  the  documents  submitted.
    Thus the matter comes before me to determine the issue.

6.   The argument which was advanced before me at the hearing  is  the  lack
    of clarity in the reasoning as to why the Judge found  one  version  of
    dishonesty to exist and did not thereafter consider the other  version,
    to determine whether that would have made any  material  difference  to
    the  issue  of  dishonesty  and  to  conduct  such  as  to  defeat  the
    application made.

7.   It seems to me that there is merit in the  argument  as  advanced  that
    there were distinct issues to be considered in relationship to what was
    done  by  the  first-named  appellant  which  were  perhaps  not  fully
    considered by the Judge.

8.   The first proposition, which is  advanced  by  the  respondent  in  the
    decision, was that essentially the first-named  appellant  deliberately
    inflated his earnings.  In terms of his earnings from employment,  they
    are set out in the decision letter as declared to Her Majesty's Revenue
    and Customs for the tax years ended 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013.  For the
    first three years they were in the order of �17,000 to �20,000,  rising
    in 2013 to some �28,449.

9.   Thus it is reasonable to conclude on that  scenario  that  it  was  the
    declarations of dividends of �32,290 which was presented  as  inflating
    earnings.  It would  seem  from  reading  the  decision  that  in  2011
    documentation was submitted to support the various earnings  and  self-
    employment.   If  the  first-named  appellant  submitted  false  and/or
    inaccurate documentation to deceive the immigration authorities  as  to
    that amount, it cannot  conceivably  be  anything  other  than  a  most
    serious offence.  The first-named appellant, of course, seeks to  blame
    the accountant, but it is difficult in that scenario  to  even  imagine
    how the accountant comes into  the  picture.   If  the  accountant  was
    submitting earnings from DNC and McDonald's to  Her  Majesty's  Revenue
    and Customs in line with those that were subsequently submitted, it  is
    difficult to conclude otherwise than the accountant  was  merely  doing
    what he was required to do, and properly so.  It is totally nonsense to
    blame an accountant for not putting in a  document  that  was  entirely
    false and the sums fictional.  If the first-named  appellant  presented
    the document falsely it is difficult to conclude otherwise than that he
    acted wholly dishonestly, and as I have said, the explanation  for  the
    blame to be passed to the accountant has really  no  bearing  upon  the
    matter.

10.  If however the �32,290 was in fact a fiction, it  is  perhaps  somewhat
    surprising that the first-named appellant has sought to  pay  tax  upon
    that to Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs thereafter.

11.  On the alternative view, the first-named  appellant  had  indeed  earnt
    �32,290 but had failed to declare  it  to  Her  Majesty's  Revenue  and
    Customs.  It is in that scenario that clearly his explanation  that  he
    trusted the accountant to put that in has some relevance.  Equally,  as
    argued on behalf of the first-named appellant by Mr Skinner,  the  fact
    that he has repaid that which was owing may be a mitigating factor  for
    the overall deception, if indeed deception was found to exist.

12.  Mr Skinner submits that there is potentially a material  difference  in
    seriousness from someone who deliberately produces false  documents  to
    the immigration services in order to obtain status to  remain  and  one
    who evaded the payment of proper tax to the Revenue and Customs but who
    has subsequently done so.

13.  It seems to me that there is merit in that  contention,  although  that
    is not to say necessarily  that  on  either  scenario  the  first-named
    appellant would succeed.

14.  The difficulty it  seems  to  me,  having  read  the  decision,  is  to
    understand how it was that the Judge came to one view of the  facts  as
    opposed to the other. The Judge at paragraphs 43 to  48  considers  the
    explanation offered by the first-named appellant as to why the sum  was
    not disclosed to Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs.  The Judge  rejects
    the explanation that the first-named appellant is not to be blamed  for
    the under-declaration and indeed remarks that mistaken  advice  is  not
    accepted and that the first-named appellant as an intelligent man would
    be aware of the regime  for  dealing  with  dividends  taken  from  the
    company.  It was noted there were no statements from anyone to  confirm
    the introduction to the accountant or of  efforts  made  to  trace  the
    accountant.  The Judge concludes in paragraph 49:-

         "I do not accept he earned the amount he  claimed  and  I  conclude
         that the figures for his earnings provided to the  Home  Office  in
         support of his application in February 2011  were  false  and  were
         deliberately  misleading.   I   find   that   his   actions   were,
         accordingly, dishonest".

     At no stage does the Judge indicate  why  it  is  that  that  situation
    exists as opposed to the under-declaration.  As I have indicated,  much
    of the consideration by the Judge is looking at whether or  not  it  is
    reasonable to accept the account that the accountant was at fault.   Of
    course if the earnings were entirely fictitious  then  there  would  be
    nothing to blame the accountant for, nor any  reason  at  all  why  the
    accountant should have become involved.

15.  The first-named appellant and appellants indeed are  entitled  to  know
    the reasoning behind the finding that was made  as  to  why  the  Judge
    chose one version over the other.

16.  The practical difficulty in this case is that it is an  appeal  against
    the decision of the respondent, who seeks to deal with matters  in  the
    alternative.  It would seem that the documents as to the earnings  were
    submitted, although copies have not been requested, nor are they in the
    possession of the first-named appellant.  There is little hard evidence
    to  indicate  whether  the  claim  for  the  dividends   was   entirely
    manufactured or whether there was a basis in the documentation for  the
    same.

17.  It seems to me a matter of fundamental  fairness  and  importance  that
    both variants of the allegation are properly considered.  If one is  to
    be preferred over the other then some reasoning to justify that  should
    be given.  If it impossible to distinguish one from the other then  the
    culpability of the first-named appellant in relation to each  needs  to
    be specifically considered and findings made as to whether the  refusal
    on the basis of conduct is reasonable  and  proportionate  in  all  the
    circumstances.

18.  As I have indicated I find there is, to  some  extent,  a  muddling  of
    thought in relation  to  the  two  possible  scenarios  which  has  the
    tendency to blur the proper considerations that are to be applied.   If
    it be a deliberate presenting of false documents to deceive it would be
    surprising indeed if that were not sufficient to denote dishonesty.  If
    it were a failure to declare,  a  decision  maker  needs  to  determine
    whether that was by mistake or by design, even if by design whether the
    subsequent actions of paying back are such as to reduce the seriousness
    that would otherwise be applied.

19.  I consider that the  lack  of  reasoning  to  justify  one  version  as
    opposed to the other to be an error of law,  such  that  I  should  set
    aside the decision to be remade.

20.  Given the findings as to credibility are to be made and evidence to  be
    called, I deem it appropriate in accordance with the Senior President's
    Practice Direction to remit the matter to the First-tier Tribunal for a
    de novo hearing on the issues.

Notice of Decision

21.  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  should  be  set  aside  to  be
    remade by a further hearing in the First-tier Tribunal.
