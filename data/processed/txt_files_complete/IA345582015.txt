                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

 1. By a decision promulgated on 9th February 2018,  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Kekic granted permission to appeal the decision  of  Designated  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Shaerf promulgated on 24th April 2017 on the  basis
    that the judge was arguably wrong in law to have concluded that he  did
    not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal.  That conclusion was based on
    the Upper Tribunal's decision in Sala (EFM;  Right  of  Appeal)  [2016]
    UKUT 00411.

 2. In the case of Khan v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017]
    EWCA Civ 1755 the Court of Appeal held that Sala was  wrongly  decided.
    Judge Kekic concluded that in the light of Khan, it was  arguable  that
    the decision was no longer legally sustainable.

 3. The Supreme Court in  the  case  of  SM  (Algeria)  v  Entry  Clearance
    Officer, UK Visa Section [2018] UKSC 9 held  that  Khan  was  correctly
    decided and that Sala should be overruled.

 4. The appeal has been listed before me for hearing in the Upper Tribunal,
    but in light of the Court of Appeal's judgment in Khan and the  Supreme
    Court's judgment in SM, the Senior Presenting Officer had accepted that
    an error of law does appear in the  decision,  and  accordingly  I  set
    aside the decision and remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.


 5. No anonymity direction is made.


Direction

 6. The appeal is to be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for  a  hearing
    de novo on all issues.
