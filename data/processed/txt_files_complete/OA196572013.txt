Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr I Hussain (LR)
For the Respondent:    Mr N Smart (HOPO)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan who was  born  on  7th  November
    1991.  She applied for leave to enter as the  partner  of  Mr  Mohammad
    Khizar, a person present and settled in the  UK,  under  paragraph  EC-
    P.1.1 of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.  The Notice  of  Refusal
    is dated 11th October 2013.  In it, the Respondent states that,  though
    the Sponsor married the Appellant in Pakistan on 3rd April 2010,  there
    was inadequate  evidence  of  there  being  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship  between  them,  and  the  phone  bills  only  showed   an
    occasional contact in 2013.  Secondly, the Sponsor, Mr Mohammad Khizar,
    failed to provide copies of his wage slips relating to  his  employment
    with Al Madhina, such that at the date of  the  application,  he  could
    show that he was earning �18,600 (see paragraphs 9 to 10).

The Judge's Findings

 2. The judge found that at the time of the ECO's decision, on a balance of
    probabilities,  the  Appellant  was  in  a   genuine   and   subsisting
    relationship with the Sponsor and intended to live together  with  him.
    The judge held that, "the Sponsor's  evidence  about  this  has  always
    remained consistent and is supported by the contents of the application
    form submitted by the Appellant" (paragraph 27).  The judge  also  held
    that "the Sponsor has known his wife all his life as she was his second
    cousin and it was an arranged marriage" and that he had visited her  in
    Pakistan for two weeks in June 2012, and that they had  lived  together
    as man and wife (paragraph 28).  The judge  held  that  they  had  then
    stayed in touch through daily contact  using  Skype,  Viber  and  Tango
    (paragraph 29).  The judge was satisfied in relation to these  matters.



 3.  What  the  judge  was  not  satisfied  with,  however,  was  with  the
    Appellant's ability to show that the Sponsor in the UK could  meet  the
    financial requirements set out in  Appendix  FM-SE.   Mr  Hussain,  who
    represented the Appellant on that occasion as well, accepted  that  the
    Sponsor, "at the time of the application had not been in employment for
    six months and that therefore he had to  provide  pay  slips  and  bank
    account statements within the period of twelve months prior to the date
    of application.  There was no dispute that the date of the  application
    was 22nd July 2013.  Therefore it was accepted by Mr Hussain  that  the
    Rules required him to supply pay  slips  and  bank  account  statements
    within ... "the requisite period" (paragraph 35).

 4. Mr Hussain had accepted that the Appellant had failed to provide  those
    documents "as at the date of the application but  has  still  not  been
    able to provide them" (paragraph 35).  The  argument  presented  by  Mr
    Hussain before the judge was that

         "The case of DR (Morocco) allows me to reset  the  relevant  twelve
         month period during which the bank statements  and  pay  slips  are
         required to a twelve month period prior to the date  of  the  ECO's
         decision rather than the date of application" (paragraph 26).

    The judge concluded  that  this  was  not  possible.   The  appeal  was
    dismissed under the Immigration Rules.

 5. The judge then went on to consider Article 8 ECHR.  He held that,

         "The evidence before me does not establish any good reason why  the
         Sponsor could not have produced the necessary pay  slips  and  bank
         statements  as  required  under  the  Rules.   The  evidence   also
         indicates that there is no reason why the Appellant could not  make
         a further application ..." (paragraph 41).

 6.  The  judge  concluded  that,  "in  any  event  it  would   have   been
    proportionate to dismiss the Appellant's appeal  by  reference  to  the
    legitimate  aim  of  effective  and  fair  immigration   control   ..."
    (paragraph 43).

 7. The appeal was dismissed.

Grounds of Application

 8. In the Grounds of Appeal, filed on 6th October 2014, it is argued  that
    the judge erred in law in concluding as he did.

 9. On 13th November 2014, permission to appeal was granted  on  the  basis
    that the judge ought to have considered the position  under  Article  8
    following the case of MM [2014] EWCA Civ 985.

10. On 2nd December 2014, a Rule 24 response was entered by  the  Secretary
    of State to the effect that

         "Appendix FM-SE A1 paragraph 2 requires that  pay  slips  and  bank
         statements should be submitted covering a six month period prior to
         the date of application or where the person had been  employed  for
         less than six months.  Then pay slips and  bank  statements  for  a
         period of twelve months prior to the date of the  application.   It
         is clear that the Appellant did not meet this  requirement  as  set
         out at paragraph 35 of the determination".

Submissions

11. At the hearing before me on 20th March 2015, Mr Hussain  repeated  very
    substantially the arguments that  he  had  already  made  before  Judge
    Thorne below.  He submitted that, though the Appellant could  not  show
    that he could meet the requirements of the Rules at  the  date  of  the
    "application", he could show that he  met  them  at  the  date  of  the
    "decision", both by the decision maker,  and  by  the  Tribunal  Judge.
    This was emphasised at paragraph 7 of the skeleton  argument  submitted
    by Mr Hussain as well.  He submitted that the Tribunal was not bound by
    an application submitted at the date of the "application" and could  go
    further and look at the application at the date of  the  decision.   He
    based reliance upon Section 85(c) of the 2002 Act  and  expressly  drew
    attention to the relevant  case  of  DR  (Morocco).   Accordingly,  the
    Appellant should have succeeded in his  appeal  under  the  Immigration
    Rules.

12. Second, he drew my attention to MB (Article 8  -  near  miss)  Pakistan
    [2010] UKUT 282, to emphasise that in an Article 8 case, when  balanced
    with the demands of fair  and  firm  immigration  control  against  the
    disruption of the family or private life of a person if removed for non-
    compliance with the Immigration Rules, the nature and degree of the non-
    compliance may well be significant.  He submitted that  the  degree  of
    non-compliance here was minimal given that the Appellant  was  able  to
    comply by the date of the "decision".  He also prayed in aid  the  case
    of Mostafa (Article  8  in  entry  clearance)  [2015]  UKUT  00112  and
    emphasised the principle that "

         "In the case of appeals brought against refusal of entry  clearance
         under Article  8  ECHR,  the  Claimant's  ability  to  satisfy  the
         Immigration Rules is not the  question  to  be  determined  by  the
         Tribunal,  but  is  capable  of  being  a   weighty,   though   not
         determinative,  factor  when  deciding  whether  such  refusal   is
         proportionate  to  the  legitimate  aim  of  enforcing  immigration
         control".

    Finally, my attention was also drawn to the case of Oludoyi [2014] UKUT
    00539 which also emphasised the  principles  applicable  in  Article  8
    cases.  Mr Hussain  ended  by  submitting  that  at  the  date  of  the
    "decision" the Appellant was  earning  �18,600.   His  difficulty  only
    arose because at the date of the "application" he had only been working
    for four months, instead of the  required  six  months,  and  therefore
    could not meet with the requirements of the Rules.

13. For his part, Mr Smart submitted that the judge was right to reject the
    appeal on the basis of a failure to provide specified  evidence.   This
    case was not simply about a shortage of pay slips.  The bank statements
    were not there.  Other documents were not there.  Indeed, even  at  the
    date of the appeal hearing before the judge there was a  deficiency  of
    evidence before the Tribunal.  The requirement of  the  Rules  is  that
    certain documents must be provided with the application.  The Appellant
    could not get round this by choosing to supplant the word "application"
    in the Rules with the word "decision" which does not appear there.

14. Second, as far as Article 8 is concerned the  judge  dealt  with  this.
    The judge concluded that, whereas Article 8 may well have been engaged,
    it was perfectly open to the Appellant to make another application, now
    that the Sponsor was working and earning �18,600, and to require her to
    do so, was not in any way disproportionate.

15. In reply, Mr Hussain submitted that the date  of  the  application  was
    22nd July 2013 and that three months had gone by  before  the  decision
    was given on 11th October 2013.  If that was the case,  and  there  had
    been a material change of circumstance, so that the Appellant  was  now
    able to show that her sponsoring husband could comply with the Rules by
    demonstrating earnings of �18,600, then this should probably  be  taken
    into account by the decision maker, and by the Tribunal.

No Error of Law

16. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1)  of
    TCEA 2007) such that I should set aside the decision.  When the refusal
    here was first made, it was made both on the  basis  of  a  failure  to
    demonstrate a genuine and subsisting marriage as well as a  failure  to
    demonstrate compliance with the financial requirements.   With  respect
    to the former, very detailed explanations were given both by the  Entry
    Clearance Officer, but also more particularly, by the  Entry  Clearance
    Manager on 12th May 2014.  For example, the ECM pointed  out  that  the
    Sponsor had stated that he communicated with the Appellant in  Pakistan
    through Skype, Viber, and Tango.  However,  the  Appellant  had  stated
    that the Sponsor stayed in touch with her "via  telephone  and  visit".
    She made no reference to other forms of communication.

17. Moreover, even the  evidence  in  relation  to  telephone  contact  was
    unsatisfactory and did not demonstrate a subsisting relationship.   The
    judge, however, appears to have taken the view, that because this was a
    "arranged marriage" where the parties had known each  other  all  their
    lives, and because "she was his second cousin" (paragraph 28) that  the
    burden of proof with  regard  to  the  marriage  being  a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship had been discharged.  Yet, the  basis  of  this
    decision was questionable.

18. The Sponsor had only visited the Appellant in Pakistan for two weeks in
    June 2012.  He did not  visit  more  often.   The  judge  accepted  the
    explanation of the Sponsor that he  did  not  do  so  "as  it  was  too
    expensive".

19. Furthermore, there was a delay in the "application for her to come  and
    join him because they had to wait until she turned 21 years old and  he
    was earning enough money" (paragraph 28).

20. It is arguable that the judge failed to demonstrate  proper  rigour  in
    coming to the conclusions that he did with respect to  these  findings.
    However, be that as it may, I do not find  that  any  failure  in  this
    regard amounts to a material error of law on the judge's part.

21. It is, however, in relation to the judge's decision with respect to the
    Appellant being able to meet the financial requirements test, that  the
    Appellant appeals in this case.  In this respect, however, the judge is
    absolutely right.  The judge sets out the relevant provisions under the
    Rules, setting out Appendix  FM-SE,  which  states  that  "all  of  the
    following evidence must be provided" and then goes  on  to  specify  "a
    period of six months prior to the date of application if the person has
    been employed by the current employer ...".  The reference here plainly
    is "to the date of application".  The reference is not to the  date  of
    "decision" as Mr Hussain argues.

22. Secondly, and no less importantly, the judge was clear that,  not  only
    was this evidence not provided at the date of the application, but that
    it had still not  been  provided  at  the  time  of  the  hearing  (see
    paragraph 35).  Third, Mr Smart  helpfully  handed  me  up  a  copy  of
    Appendix FM-SE, and it is clear that this is the version of  the  Rules
    that was applicable between 30th September 2013 and 28th October  2013.
    It makes it absolutely abundantly clear in relation to "family  members
    - specified evidence" that "in deciding an application in  relation  to
    which this Appendix states that specified documents must  be  provided,
    the Entry Clearance Officer or Secretary of State  ...  will  documents
    that have been submitted  with  the  application  ...  "(see  paragraph
    D(a)).  This leaves no doubt that the relevant period was at  the  date
    of the application.

23. That only leaves a consideration of Article 8, but the  judge  properly
    considered this, and did not consider  it  to  be  disproportionate  to
    require the Appellant to apply again, now that the Sponsor  is  earning
    �18,600.  Any other decision would be a license to applicant's to  work
    for a short period of time, such as four months as is in this case, and
    then to make an application that circumvents the  requirements  of  the
    Rules, which require six months of pay slips.

24. I should make it clear, that should there be another application by the
    Appellant it is important that the question of both the marriage  being
    a "genuine and subsisting" relationship, as well as the requirements of
    the financial threshold as applicable, are rigorously applied  in  this
    case to the relevant standard of  proof,  which  is  on  a  balance  of
    probabilities.

Notice of Decision

There  is  no  material  error  of  law  in  the  judge's   decision.    The
determination shall stand.
