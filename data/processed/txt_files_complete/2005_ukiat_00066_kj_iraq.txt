Representation
For the appellant : Mr T Hussain, Counsel, instructed by Reiss & Co.
For the respondent : Mrs R Giltrow, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS
1.    The appellant is a citizen of Iraq.

2.    With permission he appeals the determination of an  Adjudicator  (Miss
      D.M. Lambert)  which  was  promulgated  on  15  June  2004.   In  that
      determination, the Adjudicator dismissed, on  both  asylum  and  human
      rights grounds, the appellant's appeal from the respondent's  decision
      dated 13 November 2001. In that decision the respondent indicated that
      he had issued directions for the appellant's removal to Iraq following
      the refusal of his asylum application.

3.    Permission was granted only in respect of an Article 8  claim  arising
      from the respondent's relationship with a  British  citizen.   At  the
      time of the determination, the appellant had been  in  a  relationship
      with Audrey Lewis (who is now his wife but was  not  then)  for  about
      eight months, but had known her for considerably  longer.  Because  of
      possible difficulties with her two adopted daughters, he usually  only
      stayed with her at weekends when the children were with their adoptive
      father. If he occasionally stayed during the week,  he  did  so  as  a
      'friend' in order not to interfere with his girlfriend's  relationship
      with her adopted children.   It  is  said  they  had  major  emotional
      problems with  their relationship in the past and he did not  wish  to
      do anything to upset the relationship between them and their mother.

4.    The Adjudicator found that there was  no  family  life.  She  entirely
      failed to  consider  whether  there  was  any  private  life  and  the
      expression  'private  life'  does  not   feature   anywhere   in   the
      determination.  Even if the Adjudicator was right and the  appellant's
      relationship did not amount to family life within the meaning  of  the
      Convention, it may well have formed the basis of a  protected  private
      life and that possibility should have been considered.   Having  found
      there was no family life, the Adjudicator then dismissed the Article 8
      aspect of the appeal. In doing so, she went on to say that if she  had
      found there was family   life  such  that  it  would  be  breached  by
      returning the appellant, then it would have been  disproportionate  to
      require him to return to Iraq  in  order  to  obtain  entry  clearance
      because of the general conditions. She did not give any details saying
      only:
             'In the light of the current security situation in Iraq and in
             particular that there is  no  British  Embassy  in  Iraq,  the
             appellant would have to travel to Amman  to  apply  for  entry
             clearance and that travel between Baghdad and Amman is fraught
             with danger, I would have to find that it is  not  viable  for
             the appellant to make an out of country application for  entry
             clearance as a fianc� in accordance with paragraph 290  of  HC
             395.'

5.    There are several problems  with  that  finding.  First  of  all,  the
      appellant was not a fianc�, there had simply  been  an  expression  of
      hope that he would become engaged  to  his  now  wife.  Secondly,  the
      Adjudicator did  not  consider  whether  it  would  be  proportionate,
      following Mahmood [2001] INLR 1, to return the appellant in the  light
      of the fact that he had commenced the relationship, knowing full  well
      that his  application  for  asylum  had  been  refused  and  that  his
      immigration status in the United Kingdom was precarious. That was  not
      a consideration on the part of the Adjudicator.  It is  not  material,
      but there is an Embassy in Baghdad, albeit  that  it  does  not  offer
      entry clearance facilities.

6.    It is apparent from what we have said  above  that  the  Adjudicator's
      consideration of Article 8 was wholly inadequate.  There  are  several
      major errors of law. She did not consider private life at all, and her
      approach to proportionality was deficient.

7.    It falls to us to consider the  issue  afresh,  on  the  facts  as  at
      today's date. There is evidence that the appellant has now married and
      is living with his wife and new family. It is therefore clear that  if
      the appellant were returned to Iraq  now there would be  a  breach  of
      his family  life.   Mrs  Giltrow  did  not  seek  to  argue  that  the
      appellant's wife, with or  without,  her  two  adopted  children  (who
      regularly see their adoptive father), should be expected  to  go  with
      the appellant and live in Iraq.  Nor was there any suggestion that she
      could accompany him on a temporary basis. The only question  therefore
      was whether it would be proportionate to return the appellant  to Iraq
      and expect him to apply for entry clearance.

8.    There was a slight difficulty over this aspect of the appeal,  insofar
      as the respondent had not put in a respondent's  notice  to  challenge
      the Adjudicator's finding that, if her primary decision was wrong,  it
      would be disproportionate to expect the appellant to return and  apply
      for entry clearance.  This had been noted by the  Vice  President  who
      granted permission. Mr Hussain had come prepared to argue that  aspect
      of the appeal.  He did not take any point that there had  not  been  a
      respondent's notice. Nor did he seek to argue that the Vice  President
      was wrong to raise the issue when granting permission.

9.    Mr Hussain took us to MN (entry clearance facilities  -  availability)
      Iraq [2004]  UKIAT  00316  which  is  a  country  guidance  case.   He
      correctly  said  that  the  case  did  little  more  than  approve  HC
      (availability of entry clearance facilities) Iraq [2004] UKIAT  00154.
      Insofar as MN was concerned, he started by saying  that  inability  to
      pay to return, go to Amman and return to the United Kingdom was not  a
      factor which could  not be taken into account. MN only said it was not
      usually a factor to be taken into account.  He  then  referred  us  to
      paragraph 18 of MN, where the Tribunal said
             'There has been no new evidence produced to us to persuade  us
             that it would be appropriate to differ from the views  of  the
             Tribunal   as expressed in HC'.

10.    In  HC  the  Tribunal  considered  the  absence  of  entry  clearance
      facilities in Iraq itself and considered the various  routes  i.e.  by
      air or road, to Amman.  MN recognised that there was  the  possibility
      of danger involved in travelling from Baghdad to  Amman.  It  accepted
      that the Tribunal in HC did not consider that the possibility of  that
      danger established a reasonable likelihood that a claimant  could  not
      make the journeys without adverse consequences sufficient to amount to
      a  violation of his human rights. That Tribunal noted  that  Jordanian
      Airlines operate an almost daily flight between Amman and Baghdad  and
      the cost was rarely considered to be a decisive factor  in  Article  8
      appeals.  This finding followed the reasoning in HC which  dealt  with
      availability of passports,  and travel documents, to make the  journey
      to Amman.  It was acknowledged that from time to time the  border  was
      closed between Iraq and Jordan, but  that  only  delayed  travel.  The
      decision found that the background evidence was  to  the  effect  that
      whilst there may be dangers involved in  travelling  from  Baghdad  to
      Amman by land,  that did  not  establish  a  reasonable  likelihood  a
      claimant could not make a journey without adverse  consequences  or  a
      violation of his human rights. The Tribunal also found that  it  would
      not be impossible for a claimant to travel by air.

11.   Mr Hussain said that there was now fresh  and  cogent  evidence  which
      went to  the   question  of  risk  in  undertaking  the  journey,  and
      therefore proportionality.  He took us to a  letter  from  the  UNHCR,
      wrongly dated 19 January 2004, when it as clearly written  in  January
      2005.  The letter merits  the quotation of  a   considerable  extract.
      The UNHCR had been asked to  comment  on  the  safety  of  routes  for
      individuals returning to Iraq. It replied:

             'The road from Amman to Baghdad, the only major  international
             road into Iraq, is very unsafe.  The risks for  travellers  to
             date have  included: insurgent attacks, mainly against drivers
             suspected of transporting goods for multinational forces,  and
             contractors; also vehicle ambushes carried out by armed groups
             aimed not only  at  multinational  forces,  but  also  regular
             travellers who often carry valuables and money in the  absence
             of functioning banking system. UNHCR Amman confirmed  that  on
             this road, which travels through Ramadi  and  Fallujah,  there
             are random checkpoints throughout manned by  militia,  bandits
             and unpaid police.  Someone travelling on this road could face
             extortion, or abduction. If travellers do not  have  money  to
             pay the 'toll', they may be killed for  it.   UNHCR  does  not
             allow its own national staff to travel on that road.  Further,
             there is no official United Nations travel allowed on the road
             between  Baghdad  and  Amman  because  of  security   reasons.
             Travelling  on   this   road   "represents   hardship   beyond
             description".'

12.   The letter goes  on  to  say  that  within  Iraq  the  Sunni  triangle
      (through which the road goes) is particularly dangerous for Iraqis  of
      Kurdish origin due to the increasing tensions  between  the  different
      ethnic groups in Iraq.

13.   As to the safety of air travel, the letter says this:

             'It is our understanding that Royal Jordanian Airlines is  the
             only airline flying into Baghdad.  However, due  to  insurgent
             activities around Baghdad, most people  are  choosing  not  to
             fly. UN staff are only authorised to  travel  in  and  out  of
             Baghdad in aeroplanes fitted with counter measures such as  to
             deflect heat seeking missiles.  However, this equipment is too
             expensive for commercial companies. Commercial aeroplanes  are
             not a safe option as they are easy targets to attack from  the
             ground. Moreover, at the end of 2004,  a  bomb  was  found  on
             board a commercial flight. For those who do choose  to  travel
             by aeroplane, it must be noted that the road between Baghdad's
             International Airport in the centre of the city  is  known  as
             'Ambush Alley' leaving international personnel no  choice  but
             to use military helicopters to get to  and  from  the  airport
             from the fortified green zone.'

14.   The letter finishes by explaining that  the  UN  security  system  has
      five phases, where phase 1  is  normal  and  phase  5  is  a  complete
      suspension of operations and evacuation of all personnel.  The current
      situation is that the United Nations has a phase 4 security regime  in
      place for the entire country (relocation outside the  country  of  all
      remaining  internationally  recruited  staff  members   except   those
      directly concerned with emergency or humanitarian relief operations or
      security matters). The exception to this is the  governorates  of  Al-
      Anbar, Diyala and Wasit.  Those are subject to the  phase  5  security
      regime. The letter goes on to say that the route between  Baghdad  and
      Amman runs through the Al-Anbar  governorate.

15.   Mr  Hussain  made  the  obvious  point  that  if  the  appellant  were
      travelling to Amman he would have to take funds with him, which  could
      make him the subject of adverse interest when travelling around.

16.   He also referred to evidence from the appellant and his  wife  to  the
      effect that he is receiving state benefits and that they can only just
      make ends meet. He argued that  the  appellant  could  not  afford  to
      travel by air between Baghdad and Amman even if it were safe to do so.



17.   Mr Hussain argued that the travel dangers referred to by the UNHCR  in
      graphic terms; the appellant's inability to pay to fly;  the fact that
      he is a non-Arabic speaking Kurd; that, as a Kurd, he  would  need  to
      return to Baghdad, then get himself somewhere where  he  could  safely
      stay until such time as he was able to arrange to travel to Amman; all
      combine to establish that it would be disproportionate to  expect  the
      appellant to return to Iraq in order to apply for entry clearance as a
      spouse.

18.   We are persuaded that Mr Hussain is  correct.   It  is  primarily  the
      letter from the UNHCR which has persuaded us  of  that.  The  evidence
      shows that those who fly between Baghdad and Amman are  diplomats  and
      businessmen.  It is also clear that many of those get to  the  airport
      by helicopter from a secure area.  The dangers of the road  are   much
      more explicit in this correspondence than previously.

19.   Mrs Giltrow did not seek  to  argue  that  there  is  any  alternative
      mission to which it  would  be  less  hazardous  to  apply  for  entry
      clearance.

20.   In our view it cannot be argued that could be  proportionate,  in  the
      circumstances which we have set out above, to require the appellant to
      return to Iraq to apply for entry clearance.

20.   For those reasons the appellant's appeal under Article 8 is allowed.

                                                         Date: 10 March 2005
