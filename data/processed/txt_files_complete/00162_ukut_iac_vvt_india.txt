For the Respondent:    Ms C McGahey instructed by Treasury Solicitors

This is a First-tier Tribunal determination that is reported  for  what  has
been found in relation to London  College  of  Professional  Studies  namely
that LCPS did not teach any  non-accredited  courses  nor  itself  award  or
issue postgraduate  diplomas  in  any  subject.  No  one  claiming  to  have
undertaken such courses at LCPS can have done so without knowing  that  such
a claim amounted to a false representation.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a citizen of India  born  on  30  November  1982.   He
    applied for leave to remain in the United Kingdom as a  Tier  1  (Post-
    Study Work) Migrant.  His application was refused by a  decision  dated
    10 December 2009.  The reasons for refusing the application include the
    following:-

         "In your application you submitted a Postgraduate qualification  in
         Information  Technology  and  an  academic  reference  from  London
         College of Professional Studies.

         I am satisfied that all the documents submitted from London College
         of Professional  Studies  were  false  because  London  College  of
         Professional Studies has never offered  a  legitimate  Postgraduate
         qualification or issued certificates in any subject.  Additionally,
         I am also satisfied that the college  have  never  issued  internal
         certificates for any qualifications.

         Paragraph 322(1A) of the Immigration Rules provides that  leave  to
         remain in the UK is to be refused 'where false representations have
         been made or false documents or  information  have  been  submitted
         (whether or not material to the application, and whether or not  to
         the  applicant's  knowledge),  or  material  facts  have  not  been
         disclosed, in relation to the  application'.   As  false  documents
         have been submitted in relation to your application, it is  refused
         under paragraph 322(1A) of the Immigration Rules.

         Also, in view of the fact that you have  claimed  75  points  under
         Appendix A but on the basis of the documents you have provided  you
         qualify for 0 points the Secretary of State is not  satisfied  that
         you have achieved a minimum of 75 points under Appendix  A  of  the
         Immigration Rules.

         In addition, in view of the fact that you have failed to obtain  75
         points under Appendix A of the Immigration Rules Tier 1 (Post-Study
         Work), the Secretary of  State  is  not  satisfied  that  you  have
         achieved 10 points under Appendix B to the Immigration Rules.

         Therefore you do not satisfy the requirements  of  the  Immigration
         Rules for this category and it has been decided to also refuse your
         application for leave to remain  as  a  Tier  1  (Post-Study  Work)
         Migrant under paragraph 322(1A) and paragraphs 245Z(c) and  245Z(d)
         of the  Immigration  Rules.   For  the  above  reasons  I  am  also
         satisfied that you have used deception in this application."

 2. The decision then informs the appellant that he is likely to be refused
    under  paragraph  320(7B)  of  the  Immigration  Rules  on  any  future
    application for entry clearance or leave to enter and  of  the  periods
    that such refusal would be likely to last.

 3. It is further set out in the decision letter  that  in  submitting  the
    application the appellant made a  declaration  confirming  that  he  is
    aware that it is an offence under the Immigration Act 1971, as amended,
    to make a statement or representation which is known to be false or  is
    not believed to be true or to obtain or seek to obtain leave to  remain
    in the UK by means which include  deception.   In  submitting  academic
    references and Postgraduate qualifications from the London  College  of
    Professional Studies which have been found to be false  in  support  of
    the application he is warned that he  may  have  committed  a  criminal
    offence and therefore the UK Border Agency may consider taking  further
    action against him.

The appellant's immigration history

 4. The appellant's immigration history according to the respondent is that
    on 7 September 2005 he was granted leave to enter the United Kingdom as
    a student until 31 December 2006.  On 24 November 2006 he  was  granted
    further leave to remain in the UK as a student until 24 December  2007.
    On 21 December 2007 he was granted further leave to remain in the UK as
    a student until 31 July 2009.

The relevant Rules

 5. Paragraph 245Z of the Immigration Rules sets out requirements for leave
    to remain and refers to three appendices.  Paragraph  245Z(c)  requires
    an applicant to have a minimum of 75 points under paragraphs  51-58  of
    Appendix A (dealing with attributes);  paragraph  245Z(d)  requires  an
    applicant to have a minimum of 10 points under paragraphs  1  to  3  of
    Appendix B  (dealing  with  English  language)  and  paragraph  245Z(e)
    requires an applicant to have a minimum of 10 points under paragraphs 1
    to 2 of Appendix C (dealing with maintenance).

 6. In The appellant's case he was awarded no points other than  10  points
    awarded as claimed for maintenance (funds).

The appeal

 7. The appellant appeals under Section 82 of the Nationality,  Immigration
    and Asylum Act 2002 asserting that he meets  the  requirements  of  the
    relevant Immigration Rule, that he has never used any deception in  any
    of his applications and that it has clearly  not  been  proved  by  the
    Secretary of State that he has done so.   If  the  Secretary  of  State
    alleges that he has used false documents then this needs to be  proved.
    The documents produced are not in any way false and have been issued by
    the London College of Professional  Studies  (hereafter  "LCPS").   The
    grounds of appeal were  said  to  be  submitted  without  prejudice  to
    further detailed grounds that may follow in due  course  to  allow  the
    appellant  adequate  time  to  submit  all  available  information  and
    documentary evidence in relation to his appeal. No further grounds have
    followed.

Procedural History

 8. It was apparent from an early stage that there were many appeals before
    the Tribunal arising out of  refusals  of  applications  for  leave  to
    remain involving LCPS and the alleged submission of false documents  to
    the respondent.  It was hoped that there might be a few lead  cases  to
    be heard by the Tribunal at which both appellants  and  the  respondent
    would be represented and witnesses  would  be  heard  with  a  view  to
    establishing facts that would be of  help  in  deciding  other  appeals
    waiting to be heard behind the lead ones.  There were  Case  Management
    Review  hearings  and  an  agreement  reached  that  Malik   &   Malik,
    Solicitors, would represent at such lead appeals.  Ultimately  and  for
    reasons that are not necessary to set out here it has not been possible
    to set up other lead cases, this being the only one. Various directions
    have been given, all with the hope of establishing the  activities  and
    status of LCPS.  Delays thereafter have been  because  directions  were
    not complied with and the former proprietor of LCPS,  who  was  due  to
    give evidence, became  unwell  but  has  now  recovered  and  gave  key
    evidence before me.

Documentation

 9. The documents  before  me  comprise  the  respondent's  refusal  bundle
    containing the decision,  immigration  history  of  the  appellant  and
    documents annexed numbered A-E,  reasons  for  refusal  letter,  notice
    informing the appellant of the decision against which he is  appealing,
    and the notice of appeal.  The appellant produced a bundle numbered P1-
    P84 and a supplementary bundle  served  only  on  the  morning  of  the
    hearing numbered 1-95.  There is also a statement from  Professor  Fred
    Walemba with various attachments, an application for admission to LCPS,
    and a copy of the programme for the annual graduation ceremony for  the
    2007/2008 academic year in relation to LCPS.

The appellant's written evidence

10. In his witness statement dated 4 November 2010 the  appellant  confirms
    that he studied at LCPS for a Postgraduate  diploma  in  IT  (hereafter
    "PgDip IT"), this being a course that was offered by the  college  when
    he enrolled there.  He enrolled in June 2008 and paid his fees  in  two
    instalments in cash.  He did not keep the receipts to evidence  payment
    because after receiving his certificate from  the  college  he  saw  no
    reason to do so.

11. His course started on 1 July 2008 and ended  in  December  2008.   Upon
    completion he was awarded a PgDip IT.  He provided to UKBA  a  copy  of
    his enrolment letter, academic transcript, course completion letter and
    degree certificate.  The originals of  those  documents  were  retained
    upon refusal of his application.  The course commenced at 26-28  Stuart
    Street, Luton where he studied until August 2008.  In the first week of
    September 2008 the  campus  moved  to  Temple  Chambers,  68-72  Stuart
    Street, Luton.  He was told by the  college  administrator,  Ms  Preeti
    Gandhi, when he enrolled, that the college would be moving to  the  new
    campus in September 2008.

12. He was assessed for his course by way of assignments, one written  exam
    and one  project.  He  was  given  receipts  for  assignments  that  he
    submitted and he attached to his  witness  statement  copies  of  those
    assignments that he had been able to locate.  He produced a copy of his
    ID card.

13. Following the refusal of his application he contacted  LCPS  requesting
    them to confirm that he studied there.  He received a letter  dated  22
    January 2010 confirming that he completed his course with them.  He  is
    aware that LCPS was sold  by  Professor  Walemba  to  a  new  owner  in
    December 2008.  The appellant has been in touch with the new owners  on
    various occasions  regarding  the  allegations  made  against  him  and
    against various other students also.  He requested that he be  provided
    with further documents to confirm that postgraduate courses were taught
    at LCPS and was provided with various timetables  and  a  copy  of  the
    enrolment form.

14. He learned that Professor Walemba had a contractual  dispute  with  the
    new owners over money and this is the  reason  that  Professor  Walemba
    made false allegations against the college and  against  the  students.
    He learned also that  Professor  Walemba  unlawfully  removed  previous
    student records and various other databases from LCPS and a court order
    was made against him to return those.  The appellant considers that  he
    is a victim, as are other students, of a  contractual  dispute  between
    the old owners and new owners of LCPS.  He has not  been  convicted  of
    any criminal offence and is a person of good character.

Oral evidence of the appellant

15. I heard oral evidence from the appellant who spoke fluent English.   He
    confirmed as true  the  contents  of  his  written  statement  dated  4
    November 2010. He explained  that  he  paid  �2,000  in  cash  when  he
    enrolled in June 2008 and  a  further  �1,750  in  the  first  week  in
    September.  He confirmed that  he  submitted  assignments.   They  were
    submitted with forms as shown in the bundle.   Also  contained  in  the
    bundle are original assignments.  When he received the refusal he  went
    to the college and met Mr Wasey, Ms Gandhi and Mr Syed.  When he  asked
    about supporting evidence for his case he was told that many  documents
    had been lost although they did manage to find some.   The  application
    for admission form at  page  75  of  the  original  bundle  shows  that
    Postgraduate diplomas were taught at the college.  At page  77  in  the
    supplementary bundle a Google search undertaken by his friend prior  to
    going to the college in June 2008 at a time that they  were  trying  to
    find appropriate  courses  also  shows  that  there  were  Postgraduate
    diploma courses available.  Ms Gandhi was one of his lecturers and  she
    is still working with the new owner.  He spoke with her to request that
    she come to the hearing.  She was going to do so but because of a prior
    appointment was then unable to.

Questioning by Ms McGahey

16. In reply to questions from Ms  McGahey  the  appellant  said  that  his
    friend who undertook the internet research was called Pryank  Dave  who
    studied for a PgDip in Business Management.  He  also  studied  at  the
    college until December 2008 but the appellant does not know how Mr Dave
    paid his fees.

17. The appellant lived at his uncle's property in Southall  when  studying
    and travelled to the college three or four days a  week.  Sometimes  he
    was able to obtain a lift in his uncle's delivery van but otherwise  he
    would go by train.  He gave the money in cash to  Ms  Gandhi  when  the
    college was working out of the old building  at  26-28  Stuart  Street.
    The new building was about two or three blocks away from the  old  one.
    Most of the time he studied at Temple Chambers at 68-72 Stuart  Street.
    The money he paid was provided to him by  his  uncle  and  parents  who
    themselves obtained income from  a  business  back  in  India  and  the
    uncle's business in the UK.  He was not able to  obtain  from  the  new
    owners a copy of the receipts that he was given originally because they
    said that most of the documents had been stolen by Professor Walemba.

18. He was then asked to look at Professor Walemba's  statement  which  had
    various bank statements attached to it.  He was not  able  to  say  why
    there was no record of the money he paid in cash being paid  into  that
    account and commented that he was not the right person to ask about it.
     He paid in cash and obtained a receipt.

19. The appellant was then asked questions about the enrolment letter dated
    16 June 2008 appearing at page 5 of his bundle.  He was asked  why,  if
    he paid by instalments, the enrolment letter said that the tuition  fee
    had been "paid".  He offered the explanation that  the  letter  was  in
    standard form and he had by that time paid �2,000.  He  was  asked  why
    his student ID had seven digits when other students' IDs were only  six
    digits long as explained in Professor Walemba's  statement  and  as  is
    shown on the bank statement.  The appellant responded that it  was  not
    he who decided if the ID numbers were six or seven digits.  As  to  the
    original ID card he was not sure if he still had  it  but  he  had  not
    brought it with him.  He thought that the reason the ID card only  said
    London College and not London College of Professional Studies  and  had
    no big black dot on it was because the photocopying was poor.

20. The appellant was then asked  whether  he  was  saying  that  Professor
    Walemba was making mischief because of the dispute between himself  and
    the new owners.  The appellant said that he thought this  was  so.   He
    thought there was clear reason to damage former students of the college
    even though they had left  by  the  time  the  college  was  sold.   He
    considered that Mr Walemba would find any reason to stop the new owners
    doing business. He remembered Professor Walemba who was teaching health
    related subjects but he personally was not taught by him.

21. The appellant was asked if he agreed that the vast majority of students
    at the college were from Africa.  He said that there were lots of  them
    but denied that there were no students at all from India and added that
    "so many" came from India and Pakistan.  The appellant met Mr  Mohammed
    and Mr Syed in the college in about December.  He denied  that  he  had
    paid any money to be provided with bogus documents.  According  to  the
    letter of 22 January  2010  (page  68  of  the  bundle)  the  appellant
    commenced his course on 1 July 2008 and concluded  it  on  17  December
    2008.  That information was said to be "as per our records" and he  did
    not obtain the records because he did not think he needed  to  ask  for
    them.  He just requested confirmation of his attendance at the  college
    and the course he had undertaken.  The  two  witnesses  he  hoped  that
    would come to give evidence went to Haj on  6  November  so  could  not
    attend court and Ms Gandhi is on holiday.  The appellant  did  not  ask
    for an adjournment because he did not know how to and he has also  been
    awaiting an outcome of this appeal for some two years now.

22. Questioned further the appellant was then asked about  the  application
    for admission form which he produced at page  75  of  his  main  bundle
    (this is a blank form), which form does not show the proposed programme
    of study to include a PgDip IT.  The appellant  said  that  there  were
    different coloured application forms for different types of  course  so
    the one that he had filled out was not the same as the one shown in the
    bundle.  That one was provided to him by his friend  Mr  Dave  who  had
    obtained it from the college for the course he undertook.  He explained
    that the section showing that the courses started in January, April  or
    September was different from the form he filled out  which  showed  his
    course starting in July.  He talked to the  college  on  the  phone  to
    obtain  information  about  the   course   and   then   went   to   see
    administration.  He then filled in an application form which he  handed
    in.

23. The attendance sheets that appear in the bundle (p70-74) were  provided
    to him by the new owners of the college.  He accepted that this  showed
    attendance records for students in January-March 2008 in relation to  a
    PgDip in management studies course.  He accepted that there was nothing
    from the new owners that showed anything about a PgDip IT or  with  his
    name recorded.  The Google search at p77 in  the  supplementary  bundle
    showed nothing about a PgDip IT either.  The appellant  explained  that
    the search had been undertaken by  his  friend  to  obtain  information
    about courses he was interested in.  His friend provided the  appellant
    with a link to enable him to find out about the IT course for which  he
    studied.

24. The appellant was then asked about the enrolment letter (P5)  dated  16
    June 2008.  This shows three addresses at Luton,  Reading  and  London.
    The Luton campus address is shown at 26-28 Stuart  Street.   Asked  why
    the letter heading would show this address when  the  college  did  not
    move there until 24 September 2008 the appellant  said  that  it  moved
    there in early September 2008 and the college had said that it would be
    moving to that address soon. He thought that there  must  have  been  a
    delay and they had been expecting to move at an earlier date.  Was  the
    appellant aware that the London campus address shown was not  available
    until January 2009?  He responded that they  mentioned  three  campuses
    when he went there but the IT campus was not in  London.   He  did  not
    know whose  signature  appeared  on  the  16  June  2008  letter.   The
    appellant did not accept  that  the  academic  transcript  (P6)  showed
    modules relating to an HND rather than a Postgraduate course.   He  was
    given the option of the HND or Postgraduate course and  opted  for  the
    PgDip IT.  He did not  accept  either  that  the  Postgraduate  diploma
    course was far in excess of the HND one.

25. The appellant was also asked to comment on the letter dated 19 December
    2008 (P7) which bears the signature  of  Professor  Walemba.   Was  the
    appellant aware that Professor  Walemba  had  left  the  college  on  5
    December and yet had supposedly signed the letter  some  fourteen  days
    later?  The appellant confirmed that the course ended  on  17  December
    2008 and the letter was sent to him by post.  The letter  refers  to  a
    student opting  to  study  MSc  top-up  programme  from  University  of
    Sunderland.  It was put to him that the college  itself  never  offered
    top-up courses.  He replied that there were  various  options  that  he
    would have been able to look at later on.

26. The appellant was then asked about the assignment submission form (P14)
    in his bundle and the student assessment feedback shown  at  E3  as  an
    attachment to Professor Walemba's statement.  He did not know  why  the
    forms were so different.  The college stamps shown  on  the  assignment
    submission forms compared with the ones shown on 16  June  2008  letter
    may have been different because the college was using different  stamps
    for different purposes.  The appellant denied that the assignments (P19
    onwards) were HND level 3 or 4 assignments and  not  PgDip  ones.   The
    assignment was not work that he did elsewhere at another  college.   He
    had been checking stuff on his old computer and found the  assignments.
    His laptop had crashed and he lost some data.   He  did  not  keep  his
    assignments for very long.

27. He concluded his evidence by  confirming  that  he  did  study  at  the
    college and he has not put forward any bogus documents. There was no re-
    examination.

28. I asked a few questions.  The appellant said that he was at the college
    about four  days  a  week  and  there  were  seven  or  eight  teaching
    classrooms there with an average of probably  20  to  25  students  per
    class.  Classes would start at 9:30am and different  classes  would  be
    taught starting at 1.30pm.  The new premises were slightly bigger  than
    the old.

The written Evidence of Professor Walemba

29. Professor Walemba  provided  a  witness  statement  which  is  dated  1
    November 2010.  Summarising  that  statement  he  says  that  he  is  a
    Professor of Business Strategy at the  University  of  Wales  Institute
    Cardiff, and a fellow of the Royal  Society  of  Arts.  He  is  also  a
    British citizen.  He registered LCPS on 30 January 2003  as  a  limited
    company.  It was set  up  to  trade  as  an  educational  provider  for
    overseas students, mainly from Africa, who wanted to obtain a UK degree
    but could not afford the fees of a mainstream university, or could  not
    gain access to such a university.  It also provided  for  students  who
    are already in the UK but whose educational provider was not  providing
    either the standard of teaching or the support necessary to  allow  the
    student to obtain the qualification sought.  He is the sole director of
    the company and there are two issued shares: one to his wife and one to
    him.

30. LCPS operated from leased premises at  Temple  Chambers,  68-72  Stuart
    Street until 24 September 2008 when it moved to  26-28  Stuart  Street,
    Luton.  The college offered a  number  of  degree  courses  which  were
    accredited to the University of Sunderland and the University of London
    through their external programmes.  These courses were:

      i) BA (Hons) business management (level 3).

     ii) Master of business administration.

    iii) BSc in applied business computing.

     iv) BSc in international tourism and hospitality management.

      v) Foundation degree (FDA) in international  tourism  and  hospitality
         management.

     vi) BSc in sociology (University of London).

31.  Other courses were taught to allow students to  obtain  qualifications
    awarded by Edexcel.  These were:

      i) Higher national diploma business management.

     ii) Higher national diploma business information technology.

    iii) Higher national diploma travel and tourism management.

     iv) Higher national diploma tourism and hotel management.

      v) Professional development diploma in management studies.

    The college had to be approved by  the  awarding  bodies  such  as  the
    University of Sunderland, University of London and Edexcel to run  each
    of the above programmes  to  maintain  the  quality  standards  of  the
    awarding bodies for their qualifications.

32. During their courses, students completed assignments and  examinations.
    If  the  course  was  completed  successfully  they  were  awarded  the
    appropriate certificate together with a  transcript  of  their  results
    issued by the appropriate accredited awarding body.  Those certificates
    were awarded by the accredited bodies in June and December of the  last
    year of the particular course.

33. The college kept records of all registered students in relation to fees
    paid, attendance, coursework  completed,  the  marking  of  such  work,
    examination  results  and  certificates  awarded  as  well  as  records
    required by UKBA.  The college was  a  listed  body  recognised  as  an
    institution of study and it appeared on the list which allowed overseas
    students to attend.

34.  Professor  Walemba  in  his  statement  then  commented  upon  various
    documents produced by the appellant.  The  enrolment  letter  dated  16
    June 2008 (P5 of appellant's bundle) bears a signature that he does not
    recognise.  All genuine letters from the college were signed by him  or
    his brother Elvis Walemba on his behalf if he was out of  the  country.
    The letter heading refers to a  London  campus  at  93A-99A  New  Road,
    Dagenham but this campus was not advertised on the  college  letterhead
    until September 2008 as it was not due to come into use  until  January
    2009.  That same letter also shows the address of the Luton  campus  at
    26-28 Stuart Street but the college did not move to that address  until
    September 2008.  The address current at the date of the letter was that
    on the college  stamp  namely  Temple  Chambers  68-72  Stuart  Street.
    Although the letter states that the appellant's course began on 1  July
    2008 and ended  on  17  December  2008  as  with  many  other  academic
    institutions teaching at the college finished for the  summer  holidays
    at the end of July 2008 and teaching resumed at the new premises on  24
    September 2008.

35. The PgDip IT on college headed notepaper in the name of  the  appellant
    (P8) bears what appears to be Professor Walemba's signature as director
    of studies.  The evidence from him is that  the  signature  is  forged,
    firstly, because the letters in his own signature do not have the  same
    proportions as the signature on the diploma and, secondly, because  the
    signature on the diploma is precisely identical to the signature on the
    letter dated 19 December 2008 (P7) in such a way that he  believes  the
    two signatures could not have  been  produced  genuinely  by  the  same
    person  signing  twice.   He  has  never  used  a  signature  stamp  or
    stationary  pre-printed  with  his  signature.   Although  the  diploma
    purports to be for a PgDip IT (level 7) at no time during his tenure at
    the college did it offer such a course whether  accredited  by  another
    body or as an internal course.

36. The diploma also bears a reference "ID1008044" in the bottom left  hand
    corner.  That is the same  as  the  student  ID  number  given  in  the
    enrolment letter dated 16 June 2008 and the letter dated 19 June  2008.
    However, no student had that ID number.  The  statement  explains  that
    the numbers at the college began with "10" followed  by  a  four  digit
    number identifying the individual student in ascending order, such that
    the college's first student  would  have  the  number  100001  and  the
    thousandth student would have the number 101000.  The ID number on  the
    documents provided by the appellant show seven digits  instead  of  six
    and the college's genuine ID numbers have never reached more than about
    a thousand - certainly not the 8044 implied by  the  ID  number  as  it
    appears on the diploma.  Bank statements produced by Professor  Walemba
    for the period June to December 2008 show fees paid by students to  the
    college giving the student's name and/or student ID beside the relevant
    payment.  However, neither the appellant's  name  nor  the  ID  on  the
    diploma appear on the bank statements.

37. There is a seal on the diploma. The genuine college seal  is  in  quite
    different form as shown at E2 of his statement.  The college never used
    rosettes for its  seals  unlike  that  shown  on  the  forged  diploma.
    Although the diploma is said to have been signed by him as "director of
    studies" he never used that title as his correct  title  was  principal
    and chief executive.

38. The academic transcript shown at P6 for the period 1 July  2008  to  17
    December 2008 bears two addresses for the Luton campus of the  college:
    the one shown on the letterhead at 26-28 Stuart Street and the other at
    68-72 Stuart Street as shown on the stamp.  The units on  the  document
    he considers have been copied from a level 5 qualification (and an HND)
    although the document purports to relate to a level 7 qualification  at
    postgraduate level.  The college did  not  issue  transcripts  in  that
    form.

39. Professor Walemba then turns to the letter dated 19 December 2008  (the
    statement refers to 19 December 2009 but this is  clearly  a  mistake).
    The letter confirms the appellant's completion  of  the  PgDip  IT  and
    bears what purports to be Professor Walemba's  signature  as  principal
    and chief executive.  However his evidence is that  the  college  never
    issued letters of this nature and the signature on the letter is forged
    and identical to that on the diploma.  He signed no documents after  he
    sold the college on 5 December 2008 and his passport shows that  on  19
    December 2008 he flew to the United States of  America.   Although  the
    letter states that the appellant could study an  MSc  top-up  programme
    from the University of Sunderland the course mentioned  in  the  letter
    was not one of the courses approved by that university.

40. Professor Walemba has a list of all students who attended  the  college
    before 5 December 2008 and the appellant's name is  not  on  the  list.
    Also between July and December 2008 the college had  no  students  from
    India.  He usually recognised college students by  face  and  often  by
    name as they are often relatives of people  he  knows.   He  has  never
    heard of the appellant.

41. He has seen a copy of the Tier 1 application form dated 28 March  2009.
    In the form the appellant names Ms Preeti Gandhi as his personal tutor.
     In fact she was a personal assistant and IT  tutor  but  she  did  not
    teach at postgraduate level at the college since she only had a Masters
    degree and would have required a PhD to teach  a  postgraduate  course.
    It is a requirement that tutors must be qualified  to  a  higher  level
    than the course they are teaching.  However, IT was not taught  at  the
    college at postgraduate level.  Moreover there were no personal  tutors
    at the college, only group tutors.  Ms Gandhi assisted in  small  group
    tutorials but did not take classes, owing to her imperfect  command  of
    English.

42. The assignment submission forms (P10-P17) produced by the appellant are
    totally different from those used by  the  college  during  the  period
    covered by the forms produced by him.  Furthermore the college stamp on
    the forms is not genuine as it never had a  stamp  in  that  form  even
    while at the address indicated on the stamp.  The actual stamp  was  in
    the form of that used on the letters dated 16 June 2008 and 19 December
    2008 although those letters are also forgeries.  Although Ms Gandhi did
    not teach the units referred to on the  assignment  forms  she  sat  at
    reception and may have signed for them in that role.  He refers in  the
    statement to a copy of the genuine college assignment  submission  form
    attached to his statement at "E3".

43. His further written  evidence  is  that  the  purported  identity  card
    produced is not genuine.  It is different to that annexed to  Professor
    Walemba's statement at E4, which is a genuine identity card.

The oral evidence of Professor Walemba

44. Professor Walemba adopted his witness statement and also the statements
    that he made to the police appearing in the respondent's bundle  at  C2
    and  following.   The  application  form  for  admission  (at  P75  and
    following) was the only type of application form used and the  proposed
    programme of study courses mentioned on the forms were  the  only  ones
    that were offered.  One of the  courses,  the  BSc  (Hons)  in  Applied
    Business Computing, was a three year course.  The first  two  years  of
    the course consisted of an HND in Business Information  Technology  and
    students could then top up and study for  the  BSc  (Hons)  in  Applied
    Business Computing.  That degree  was  awarded  by  the  University  of
    Sunderland.  The HND courses were awarded by  Edexcel.   The  PgDip  in
    Management Studies was a short course which could then be topped up  to
    an MBA which was again awarded by the  University  of  Sunderland.  The
    PgDip in Project Management could  be  topped  up  to  an  MSc  Project
    Management by a further period of study.

45. Prof Walemba went on to say that while he was in charge  LPCS  did  not
    award any qualifications in its own right.  He has never heard  of  the
    appellant's friend Mr Dave and he is sure that he was not a student  at
    the college. The reason Professor Walemba is sure is because he  taught
    on the PgDip in Management Studies and if Mr  Dave  had  been  on  that
    course he would have known him.  Furthermore Professor Walemba was  the
    lead  internal  verifier  at  the  college.   As  for  The  appellant's
    assignments attached to his statement he assessed  that  the  work  was
    level 4 or possibly level 5 but certainly not postgraduate level.

46. Turning to payments made the college did accept cash payments and if  a
    student paid by cash he or she would have been given  a  receipt.   The
    cash was then  put  in  the  bank  with  the  student  ID  and/or  name
    identifying from whom the money came.  It was normal  for  students  to
    pay up front.  They were expected to pay 50 percent of  the  fees  when
    they enrolled although the balance could then be paid  in  instalments.
    Money was always lodged at the bank in this way and  none  was  put  in
    without some form of reference.  The money would be collected either by
    Professor Walemba himself, his brother Elvis, or Ms Gandhi.   An  entry
    on 10 June 2008 showed  a  correction  to  a  cash  entry  having  been
    deposited.

47. Although the appellant says that he joined up at the college  with  his
    friend Mr Dave and that his friend studied  for  a  PgDip  in  Business
    Management this was not correct because they did not  run  that  course
    although there was a course run at the college which led to a PgDip  in
    Management Studies.  He then named several teachers  in  that  subject.
    Professor  Walemba  himself  taught  one  module,  that  of   strategic
    management.  These were small classes  of  perhaps  twelve  to  fifteen
    students and as stated previously he was the lead internal verifier.

48. The college had about 200 students at any one time  at  the  Luton  and
    Reading campuses and he knew most, if not all, of them.   Although  the
    appellant said that there were lots of students from India and Pakistan
    there were  not.   Indeed  there  were  very  few  of  them.   He  then
    identified those students.  He recognised the names of one  Bangladeshi
    student and one from Pakistan.  Virtually all the  students  came  from
    Africa.  He knew this because most had studied at one  of  his  centres
    abroad and came to the UK to complete their degrees.

49. Professor Walemba then produced what he identified  as  the  graduation
    ceremony programme for the academic year 2007/2008. The  ceremony  took
    place on 1 December  2008  and  was  an  annual  event  only.   If  the
    appellant had been due to graduate then his name would  appear  on  the
    list.  Applications for admission were to courses starting in  January,
    April and September.  None started on 1 July 2010.

Questioning by Mr Khan

50. In reply to questions from Mr Khan, Professor Walemba was asked why  he
    described himself as a Professor of Business Strategy at University  of
    Wales Institute in Cardiff when his name did not appear on the list  of
    staff there.  He responded that he  is  a  visiting  professor  at  the
    university and denied that he  was  trying  to  deceive  by  describing
    himself in the way that he did.

51. The bank statements that he produced showed a gap between 3 July and  4
    August at a time when the appellant said that he had paid some  of  the
    money in cash.  Professor Walemba denied that he was being selective in
    producing particular bank statements.  The statements shown were  those
    relating to the business account.  He did not treat the  account  as  a
    personal one. The debit card payment to "Just Tyres" for �1,000  on  27
    June 2008 was in relation to purchasing tyres for the company car.   It
    was his habit to take drawings from that account.  It was  put  to  him
    that there were eighteen deposits in the period  covered  by  the  bank
    statements where no deposit reference was shown.  He responded that the
    reference would be marked on the bank deposit slips which he could find
    if necessary.

52. Professor Walemba was asked also why he still has in his possession  an
    original application for admission and related  documentation  for  one
    student considering that the court  order  in  relation  to  the  civil
    proceedings between him and successors to the college required that  he
    return all documents.  He responded that those documents  were  in  his
    possession before the college was taken over, he had not  seized  them,
    and therefore they were not part of the order  requiring  that  certain
    items be returned.  He added that UKBA said that he should keep hold of
    such documents and he then named the person who told him to do that.

53. He was then asked about a student that he had  contacted  via  Facebook
    demanding that fees be paid to him and informing her that he would keep
    her degree certificate until she paid off the fees.  Professor  Walemba
    said that the student contacted him.  She knew that the  University  of
    Sunderland was issuing the degree and he never received the money  even
    though she did agree to pay.  He accepted that any contract was between
    her and the college and not with him because by 5 December 2008 he  had
    nothing further to do with it. However, he then  commented  that  by  a
    verbal agreement he had paid for her at university  because  she  asked
    him to do so.  This was not  an  arrangement  he  had  with  any  other
    students.  He denied that he lied in the affidavit that he swore in the
    civil proceedings about what documents he had removed from the college.
     He also denied that he had tried to destroy the college since  leaving
    it because of the monetary dispute.

54. He agreed that there were about 100 students at the Luton campus.   The
    graduation programme showed  the  names  of  307  students.   This  was
    explained by LCPS being part of a group with students  graduating  from
    Reading, and also from the Gambia and Eritrea.  All graduating students
    from abroad were invited to the graduation ceremony but  most  did  not
    attend and they graduated in absentia. The names of those graduating in
    absentia are set out in the programme. There was no re-examination.

55. Ms McGahey and Mr Khan made submissions.  I made a full  note  of  them
    and I have taken them into account in arriving at my decision.

Burden and Standard of Proof

56.  The  burden  of  proving  compliance  with  the  relevant  substantive
    Immigration Rule or Rules is on the appellant and the standard of proof
    is the balance of probabilities.

57. Where there are general  grounds  for  refusal  under  part  9  of  the
    Immigration Rules -rule 322(1A) in this appeal where leave to remain in
    the UK is to be refused if proven - the burden of proof  falls  on  the
    respondent.  As  discussed  at  paragraphs  98-102  of  NA  and  Others
    (Cambridge College of Learning)  Pakistan  [2009]  UKAIT  00031  having
    regard to Re B (Children) [2008] UKHL 35 there is but  a  single  civil
    standard of proof in appeals of  this  nature  which  is  that  of  the
    balance of probabilities, but in the  light  of  the  possible  serious
    consequences of refusal under part 9 the respondent needs:

         "...to furnish evidence of sufficient strength and quality  and  he
         (and the Tribunal) would  need  to  subject  it  to  a  'critical',
         'anxious' and 'heightened' scrutiny."

    (Paragraph 101, NA and Others).

Findings

58. Mr Khan in his submissions, as in his questioning of Professor Walemba,
    attacked his credibility.  It is said that Professor Walemba is  not  a
    man who comes to the Tribunal with clean hands.  He  described  himself
    as a professor at UWIC but now says that he is  a  visiting  professor.
    He removed materials from the college at the time of sale which did not
    belong to him and returned them only when injuncted to do so.   Further
    evidence had been produced today to  show  that  he  had  not  returned
    documents.  It is clear that he has been trying to attempt  to  destroy
    the college and those within it and that students harmed by his actions
    would merely be viewed as  "collateral  damage".   The  letter  to  the
    student who apparently owed the college (not him) money was  tantamount
    to blackmail since she would not receive her degree certificate  unless
    she paid the money.

59. I have considered these and all the other points raised and I have done
    so with considerable care. To describe himself as a professor  at  UWIC
    is, to an extent, misleading and an exaggeration of his true  position,
    which is that of a visiting professor. Nevertheless in my finding  such
    a statement does not fundamentally undermine his credibility. I  accept
    that he is a professor but he should not have described himself in  the
    way that he did without qualifying the statement to clarify that  is  a
    visiting professor at UWIC.

60. It is unfortunate that he did not produce all the  bank  statements  in
    sequence. If he had done so he would have  dealt  with  the  suggestion
    that he was being selective in what statements he did produce and  that
    he did that for a reason. Nevertheless, he did produce  statements  for
    the period that the appellant said that he made his first cash  payment
    so I think the point is a minor one in the circumstances.  Although  no
    payment is shown in the account from the appellant during that period I
    don't find that is very significant. For  instance,  there  must  be  a
    possibility that having paid in cash the money was simply then pocketed
    or placed in another account. If that happened it would not be shown in
    the college bank account. What is apparent is that a number of payments
    throughout the period covered by the bank statements were made into the
    account of "the directors London College  of  Professional  Studies  UK
    Ltd" and that those payments were identified by the names  of  students
    and/or ID numbers.

61. It is not for me to examine in any depth the dispute between  Professor
    Walemba and those to whom he sold, or perhaps  intended  to  sell,  the
    college for a sum of money in late 2008. I have noted that there  is  a
    copy of an interim injunction in the appellant's bundle  which  appears
    to show that Professor Walemba was required to return all the documents
    that had been removed by him from the Luton campus at the beginning  of
    April 2009. This would appear to leave open the question of whether  he
    should have handed over  all  documents  etc  in  his  possession,  not
    limited to those that he seized in April 2009 but also  those  from  an
    earlier date and prior to the sale. Such documents etc would  not  seem
    to be covered  by  the  injunction  but  perhaps  are  covered  by  the
    agreement on sale.  The  difficulty  arises  as  to  whether  the  sale
    agreement terms have been breached by either or both parties  but  that
    is not a matter for me to decide. It suffices for me to say that  I  do
    not find that Professor Walemba's credibility is damaged  by  being  in
    possession of the documents that he produced at the hearing.

62. One matter about the behaviour  of  Professor  Walemba  that  does  not
    impress me is that relating to him contacting a former student  at  the
    college seeking payment of fees owed by her with him informing her that
    he would keep the degree certificate until  the  fees  are  paid.  Even
    allowing for the fact that Professor Walemba  gave  evidence  that  the
    student concerned had apparently contacted him and he agreed to pay for
    her at university it does seem to me an unwise e-mail to have  written.
    Nevertheless it is not suggested that the fees  were  it  not  in  fact
    owing and therefore to describe the e-mail as tantamount  to  blackmail
    is putting it far too high. Viewed in that light I do not find that  it
    damages Professor Walemba's credibility  in  relation  to  the  central
    issues in the appeal.

63. Overall, and bearing all the above in mind I have been  struck  by  the
    consistency of Professor Walemba's evidence in relation to matters that
    can be verified and have been verified  by  documents  that  have  been
    produced.  I have found him generally to be a  witness  of  truth.   He
    gave his evidence in a straightforward way and was  precise  about  his
    role  at  LCPS  and  that  evidence  was  wholly   supported   by   the
    documentation that he produced.

64. I have found particularly  persuasive  the  production  of  the  annual
    graduation ceremony programme  which  wholly  supports  his  testimony.
    This was referred to in the witness statement dated 29 April 2009 given
    to UKBA. The programme is said to have marked the largest  passing  out
    ceremony  of  307  graduates  in  six  different  categories  from   21
    countries. The students graduating are all named whether attending  the
    award ceremony or graduating in absentia.  However,  the  name  of  the
    appellant is not shown, nor that of his friend Mr Dave.

65. The programme sets out of the order of proceedings for the day which is
    described as the annual graduation  ceremony  2007/2008  academic  year
    held on Monday 1 December 2008 at Chiltern Hotel, Luton.  The order  of
    proceedings is followed up by a welcome which includes the following:-

         "This year  we  mark  the  largest  passing  out  ceremony  of  307
         graduates in six different categories from 21  countries.   However
         today we have 100 present  and  the  rest  will  be  graduating  in
         absentia.

         87 HND Business Management,

         42 HND Business Information Technology,

         3 HND Travel and Tourism Management,

         14 HND Tourism and Hotel Management,

         1 BSc Sociology,

         23 BA (Hons) Business Management,

         25 BSc (Hons) Applied Business Computing,

         93 Professional Development Diploma in Management Studies,

         19 Master of Business Administration."

    The welcome extends to one page and is followed with information  about
    LCPS which includes the following:-

         "The college prides itself on offering top  quality  tuition  in  a
         warm, caring and stimulating environment.  This emphasis on quality
         is  demonstrated   through   the   host   of   certifications   and
         accreditations that we  have.   These  include  London  College  of
         Professional Studies being:

           . an approved Edexcel centre through its  partners  -  corporate
             resource development institute;

           . an accredited tutor  support  centre  for  the  University  of
             Sunderland;

           . a tuition provider to undergraduate and  postgraduate  courses
             by the University on (sic) London external programmes."

66. I note also that it is said there that the  college  has  continued  to
    grow and will open a third campus in London in the next academic year.

67. I find that it is almost inconceivable  that  the  graduation  ceremony
    programme would not include mention of those awarded a PG Dip IT if the
    college had ever taught that subject. It would be possible, I  suppose,
    for none of the students who studied for that subject to have graduated
    in it and hence their names would not appear in the  programme  but  of
    course that is not the appellant's case. He has given evidence that not
    only did he study for it but  he  successfully  completed  an  approved
    course of study and was awarded a diploma which has been  produced  and
    which is dated "December 2008".

68. There is another matter. The course is supposed to  have  ended  on  17
    December 2008 and therefore I assume he  must  have  been  awarded  the
    diploma on or after that date. I have to ask  myself  why  the  college
    would  have  a  graduation  ceremony  on  1  December  2008  for  those
    graduating in other subjects  leaving  The  appellant  and  any  others
    graduating at the same time as him missing out on  that  ceremony  with
    none other in sight until possibly the  following  December.  I  reject
    what the appellant says took place.

69. I find that  I  accept  also  Professor  Walemba's  evidence  regarding
    student ID.  The student identifications in  the  bank  statements  are
    wholly consistent with  the  evidence  on  the  point  showing  student
    identification numbers as six numbers and not seven and the  last  four
    digits being either side of 1,000.  This fits entirely  also  with  the
    claim in the graduation programme that "we have to date seen over 1,000
    students graduate in a number of disciplines...".  The one student card
    produced by Professor Walemba indicates the student number also of  six
    digits being the student number 523. As a result of all this  I  reject
    that the appellant had a student ID number of 1008044.

70. The enrolment letter of 16 June 2008 refers to three campuses.   I  can
    understand that the appellant might be confused about the two addresses
    at which he allegedly studied when asked about it at court - by  reason
    of nervousness - but there is no reason for him to be confused when  he
    gave his written statement.  I prefer the evidence of Professor Walemba
    that the college was originally at Temple Chambers and did not move  to
    26-28 Stuart Street until September 2008.  I am able to understand  why
    the Luton campus was shown in June 2008 at 26-28 Stuart Street because,
    perhaps, the move had been delayed but reject  that  a  genuine  letter
    heading would include the address of the London  campus  at  that  time
    when the campus was not due to come into use until January 2009.  There
    is a further matter relating to that letter. I do  not  accept  that  a
    tuition fee would be said to be "paid" as per the letter if it had  not
    been paid in full.  Even the evidence of the appellant is that  he  had
    not paid in full by that stage  but  in  cash  by  two  instalments.  I
    therefore reject that the letter of 16 June 2008 is genuine.

71. The student assessment feedback  form  produced  by  Professor  Walemba
    dated 30 August 2008 appears genuine. The assessment  feedback  on  the
    form is much as one might expect from a tutor to a student  and  it  is
    interesting to note that it  shows  the  same  name  as  a  person  who
    received a Diploma in professional development in management studies in
    the graduation programme in December 2008.  The  assignment  submission
    forms produced by the appellant are in common form and show the student
    number that I have decided did not exist. There is no feedback  on  the
    forms. It is possible that there were different forms being used at the
    same time by the college  and  that  feedback  was  given  in  the  way
    described by The appellant but  I  prefer  the  evidence  of  Professor
    Walemba on the matter

72. Whereas I accept that it cannot have been easy  for  The  appellant  to
    face lengthy questioning from experienced Counsel and whilst  accepting
    also that he undoubtedly has  been  to  one  or  both  of  the  college
    campuses at Luton because he was able to provide sufficient information
    about them, beyond that his evidence was seriously wanting.

73. Although there were  matters  about  which  he  could  perhaps  not  be
    expected to comment authoritatively, such as the addresses appearing on
    the  headed  notepaper  and  the  ID  number,  he   has   been   wholly
    unsatisfactory in dealing with other matters.  He had  the  benefit  of
    Counsel (two of them at the hearing) but no witnesses  to  assist,  nor
    even  witness  statements  from  them  -  on  matters  of   importance.
    Furthermore, although he was able to produce evidence  that  apparently
    was obtained by his friend who was studying at the college on a  course
    of interest to him he was not able to produce any  equivalent  evidence
    about the course that he, the appellant, allegedly studied there.

74. It is remarkable also that in the letter dated 22 January 2010 there is
    reference to the appellant commencing his course on 1 July 2008 "as per
    our records".  If indeed the college had those  records  there  was  no
    good reason not to produce them or for those advising the appellant  to
    attempt to obtain them which would help prove his case.  If in fact the
    records were part of those that were seized by Professor  Walemba  then
    the letter could not accurately state that the  information  was  given
    "as per our records".  The appellant is an intelligent young man who, I
    find, would have realised the importance of producing the records.  The
    letter of 19 December 2008 and the postgraduate diploma bear signatures
    that to my untrained eye are identical but I place no great  weight  on
    that observation.  As I believe Professor Walemba I find  that  neither
    document was signed by him.  There is a witness statement from Margaret
    White who is a consultant graphologist.  She  made  a  report  dated  4
    March 2010 but no reliance can be placed upon  the  report  because  it
    refers to exhibits which are not in fact exhibited.  In any  event  the
    expert was not called and was not available to be cross-examined.

75. I accept the submission on behalf of Professor Walemba that  there  was
    no good reason that he would wish to harm  a  genuine  student  at  the
    college.  He would have every wish to deal with bogus students  because
    his reputation matters to him.  I cannot see what  possible  reason  he
    could have for damaging a genuine student.  I reject the argument which
    appears to be to the effect that he would take any measures to  attempt
    to destroy the college and anyone associated with it he  would  attempt
    to destroy their reputations as well. He is or has  been  embroiled  in
    litigation with his successors at the college and may have every reason
    to be as awkward as possible with them but I  do  not  find  that  this
    battle at all likely to extend to attempting to destroy the future  and
    reputation of The appellant and others who may be in a similar position
    to him.

General conclusions

76. After a thorough review of all  the  evidence  in  this  appeal  it  is
    possible to state two general conclusions with  regard  to  LCPS  until
    December 2008 when the College was or was intended to be sold.

    (i). LCPS did not teach any non-accredited courses nor itself award  or
      issue postgraduate diplomas in any subject.

    (ii). If a student ID number consists of 7 digits the number  will  not
    be genuine. Genuine student IDs consisted of  6  digits.  However,  the
    mere fact that a student ID number  comprises  6  digits  does  not  of
    itself define a genuine student.

Conclusions in this appeal

77. In the light of the above I find that the respondent has discharged the
    burden of proving on the balance of probabilities that LCPS never ran a
    PgDip IT.  I have found that the evidence furnished is of  the  quality
    to which I have previously referred.

78. It follows from this finding that no-one claiming  to  have  undertaken
    such a course at LCPS can have done so  without  knowing  that  such  a
    claim amounted to a false representation.  It is  quite  apparent  from
    the evidence given by the appellant that he knew of the diploma and its
    accompanying documents and what they purported to show.  I am satisfied
    also that the letters that the appellant produced dated 16  June  2008,
    19 December 2008 and 22 January 2010 are false and that he knew them to
    be false.  The refusal letter includes  a  paragraph  saying  that  the
    respondent  considers  that  the  appellant  used  deception.   It  was
    confirmed at the hearing that it is  the  respondent's  case  that  the
    appellant did not make false representations or submit false  documents
    unknowingly but he did so deliberately and that satisfies the test  for
    a finding of deception. I agree. For these reasons I am satisfied  that
    the appellant used deception in his application.

Paragraph 245Z

79. The decision to refuse has been based on both general  and  substantive
    grounds.  Having found that the appellant was  properly  refused  under
    paragraph 322(1A) it is not strictly necessary for  me  to  decide  his
    position under paragraph 245Z.  It is for the appellant to show that he
    can meet the requirements of paragraph 245Z.   In  my  finding  he  has
    patently failed to prove that he does meet those requirements and  that
    is for the same reasons as are set out  in  the  refusal  letter.   The
    appellant properly fell to be refused under paragraph 322(1A) and  thus
    was bound to fail under paragraph 245Z.

Decision

80. For the above reasons, this appeal is dismissed.
