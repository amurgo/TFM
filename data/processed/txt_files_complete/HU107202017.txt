                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant appeals with permission against the  decision  of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Holmes who in a decision promulgated on 4 June 2018
    dismissed his appeal against the decision of 10 September  2017  as  he
    did not meet the financial eligibility requirements  of  paragraph  EC-
    P.1.1(d) of Appendix FM of HC  395  with  reference  to  paragraphs  E-
    ECP.3.1 to E-ECP.3.4.

2.   As the judge properly noted, as the application  was  decided  after  6
    April 2015 the sole permitted ground of appeal was  that  the  decision
    was unlawful under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.

3.   In a commendably  thorough  diligent  decision,  the  judge  gave  full
    consideration to the evidence and concluded that  the  appeal  did  not
    succeed.

4.   The appellant appealed on various grounds and  was  granted  permission
    with regard to the points identified by the Judge  granting  permission
    as grounds 5 and 6.  The first of these is an argument that  the  Judge
    did not attach proper weight to the fact that the appellant's wife  and
    sponsor who is a medical student, would not be able to gain  experience
    and compete in the American healthcare  system  as  the  United  States
    would not recognise her medical training  and  that  this  obstacle  to
    relocation overseas could result in  unjustifiably  harsh  consequences
    for the appellant and the sponsor.  The other matter was in effect that
    the judge erred in his findings in respect of the  appellant's  attempt
    to meet the financial requirements of Appendix FM  paragraph  D-ECP  in
    that he had shown an alternative form of income  available  and  should
    have been considered, such as those in paragraph 21A of Appendix  FM-SE
    and that he would be financially  stable  together  with  his  sponsor,
    including prospective income, to meet all financial requirements.

5.   The appellant appeared in person.  He was  of  considerable  assistance
    in identifying relevant documents and making  clear  arguments  on  the
    points in question.

6.   After a thorough evaluation of the evidence it became  clear  that  the
    claim could not succeed with regard to earnings, which was  essentially
    one of the judge's conclusions.  It seemed sufficiently clear that  the
    evidence in this regard in some came to no more than  earnings  on  the
    part of the appellant from his long distance English language  teaching
    students of a Vietnamese and a Chinese college respectively, showing no
    more than the equivalent of �11,250.  Though he was  able  to  identify
    the earnings from the Chinese company, Da Da ABC  where  he  identified
    the contract with them and payments that they had agreed to  make  into
    his wife's bank account,  it  appeared  that  the  Vietnamese  company,
    Topica Native were not prepared to make payments into her  account  and
    made payments into his account, and he had not been able  to  obtain  a
    bank statement from his American bank.  In addition  he  had  not  been
    able to provide a copy of the  contract  with  Topica  Native  for  the
    relevant dates.  So at best his earnings were �11,250 to which could be
    added the �3,482 grant element of the sponsor's finance, but since that
    came to a total of under �15,000, it could not meet the requirement  of
    the Immigration Rules of needing to show �18,600.

7.   The remaining issue is that of difficulties arising from the  inability
    of the sponsor to work in the United States because the US registration
    system would not allow her to practice as a doctor at  least  for  some
    time and also after the passing of a number of examinations.

8.   The judge noted that paragraph GEN.3.1 of  Appendix  FM  provided  that
    where the minimum income requirement under Appendix FM applies  and  is
    not met from the specified sources referred to there and it is  evident
    from  the  information  provided  by  the  applicant  that  there   are
    exceptional circumstances which could render refusal of the application
    a breach of Article 8  because  it  could  emphasise  a  result  in  an
    unjustifiably harsh consequences for  the  applicant,  his  partner  or
    relevant child, the decisionmaker must go on to  consider  whether  the
    minimum income requirement  is  met  if  other  credible  and  reliable
    sources of income, financial support or funds available to  the  couple
    are taken into account.   Those  sources,  and  matters  to  which  the
    decisionmaker  should  have  regard  when  assessing  the  genuineness,
    credibility and reliability are set out at paragraph 21A of Appendix FM-
    SE.  The sources that may be considered  include  credible  prospective
    earnings  from  sustainable  employment  or  self-employment   of   the
    applicant or their partner, and any other credible and reliable  source
    of income or  funds  for  the  applicant  or  their  partner  which  is
    available at the date of application or  which  will  become  available
    during the period of limited leave applied for.

9.   The judge noted that in this regard the matters raised were  first  the
    sponsor's continuing medical training and intended career  in  the  NHS
    and second the financial burden that might fall upon the appellant  and
    the sponsor if they had  to  continue  their  family  life  in  a  long
    distance fashion.  The judge noted that the fact  that  they  would  be
    living in  their  respective  countries  would  not  prevent  him  from
    visiting his wife or vice versa but the concern expressed  was  to  how
    much that would cost and the judge took that concern into account.  The
    judge noted that all the circumstances identified as problematic  would
    be strictly temporary.  According to the appellant, in less than twelve
    months the sponsor would be taking up a contract to work in the NHS  at
    what was claimed to be a minimum rate of �23,091, which if it  happened
    would entitle the appellant to  make  a  fresh  application  for  entry
    clearance with every prospect of  satisfying  the  financial  threshold
    under the Rules.

10.  The judge considered that upon his findings as set out at paragraph  24
    of his decision the appellant had clearly  failed  to  demonstrate  any
    exceptional circumstances  within  the  meaning  of  GEN.3.1.   It  was
    therefore, he considered, strictly  speaking  unnecessary  for  him  to
    consider the computations whereby the appellant had suggested  that  if
    exceptional circumstances were shown he would be able  to  show  "other
    credible and reliable sources of income, financial  support  or  funds"
    which would enable him to meet the income threshold.  The judge pointed
    to the difficulties and  the  calculations  appeared  to  rely  on  the
    sponsor's income of �9,044 in relation to which  it  was  unclear  what
    parts were loan and what parts grant and also  the  appellant  believed
    the money he had made from working while in the  United  Kingdom  as  a
    visitor could be counted as lawful income but the  judge  doubted  that
    was so, in particular as he could not see any evidence of  arrangements
    of tax to be paid on this income.

11.  Though it is now clear as I have set out  above  what  element  of  the
    �9,044 finance is the grant element and also  that  the  appellant  has
    been earning his income from long distance English teaching online,  to
    an extent the points there are clarified, it remains unclear which  tax
    regime would have the benefit of assessing the appellant to tax bearing
    in mind as he said in evidence he had done  this  work  in  the  United
    Kingdom, Spain and the United  States  of  America  over  the  relevant
    period.

12.  I consider that the judge did not err in law in his  conclusion  as  to
    "exceptional circumstances" in this  case.   His  conclusion  that  the
    circumstances identified, which he considered at paragraph  24  of  his
    decision, are not exceptional circumstances is sound.  It was  open  to
    him to find that the consequences of refusal would not be unjustifiably
    harsh.  The fact that as noted above he may have erred in regard to the
    other income, cannot mar that finding upon which the other points  fall
    away in light of its soundness.

13.  Nor do I see any force to the argument in  respect  of  Razgar  on  the
    human rights test as set  out  by  the  judge  and  as  argued  by  the
    appellant.  The judge gave full consideration to the Razgar test and in
    particular with regard to proportionality, and came to  conclusions  to
    which he was fully entitled.  The reasoning at paragraphs 28 to  30  of
    the decision in this regard in particular are sound.

14.  Though one can only sympathise with the appellant and his  wife  as  to
    the outcome of this appeal, I hope they may be sustained  by  the  fact
    that first of all it is as apparent from his attendance at the hearing,
    perfectly possible for the appellant to visit the United Kingdom at the
    current time, and also it seems clear that the sponsor will be  earning
    above the threshold income level as of August this year.  It  does  not
    appear that there are concerns as to eligibility  or  suitability,  and
    there must, as the judge noted,  be  every  prospect  of  a  successful
    application being made as and when the sponsor takes up her  employment
    in August.  But as matters stand I do not consider  that  it  has  been
    shown that the judge erred in law in his decision,  and  that  decision
    dismissing the appeal must therefore stand.
