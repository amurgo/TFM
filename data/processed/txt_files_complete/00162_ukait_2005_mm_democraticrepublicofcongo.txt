Representation:

For the Appellant:           Mr J Bryce of Brown & Co
For the Respondent:    Mr B Craven, Home Office Presenting Officer

The fact that pre-June 2003 DRC documents have a heading suggesting some
official authority cannot, in the absence of other evidence, be taken as
implying that they derive from the organs of the state as now constituted.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

  1. The Appellant is a citizen of the Democratic Republic  of  Congo.   He
     apparently entered the United Kingdom illegally on 22  July  2003  and
     claimed asylum a couple  of  days  later.   On  4  October  2004,  the
     Respondent served him with a decision that he should be removed as  an
     illegal entrant having refused him asylum.   The  Appellant  appealed.
     His appeal was heard by an Adjudicator, Mr J G MacDonald,  who,  in  a
     determination sent out on 23 December 2004, dismissed  his  appeal  on
     asylum and human rights grounds.  The Appellant sought  permission  to
     appeal to the Immigration Appeal Tribunal.  Permission was refused and
     the Appellant thereupon sought Statutory Review of that  refusal.   In
     an interlocutor dated 18 March 2005, Lady Cosgrove  granted  Statutory
     Review.  We should set out the material  parts  of  the  note  to  the
     interlocutor in full:

           "I have considered the papers and productions in this  case  and
           have reached the view  that  the  petitioner's  application  for
           leave to appeal against the  adjudicator's  decision  should  be
           granted.


           It appears from paragraph 46 of the adjudicator's  determination
           that he excluded certain  documentary  productions  because  the
           documents put before him were translations and not originals  or
           copies.  The affidavit now lodged  from  the  petitioner's  then
           solicitor indicates that the failure to lodge the documents  was
           entirely his fault.  It also appears that this failing  was  not
           brought to the attention of the Tribunal when  leave  to  appeal
           was sought.


           From the  information  available  to  me  it  seems  that  these
           documents may be relevant to demonstrate that the agent  of  the
           petitioner's  persecution  was  the  State  which  would  be  of
           significance in respect of the adjudicator's findings as to  the
           possibility of internal relocation to Kinshasa  (paragraph  44).
           In these circumstances I find that the  Tribunal  has  erred  in
           refusing to grant leave to appeal."

  2. Following the commencement of the appeals provisions of the 2004  Act,
     the grant of leave to appeal to the Tribunal arising from the  success
     on the petition for Statutory Review operates as  an  order  that  the
     Tribunal reconsider its determination on grounds limited to  those  on
     which permission to appeal to  the  Immigration  Appeal  Tribunal  was
     granted.

  3. The Adjudicator  largely  accepted  the  Appellant's  account  of  his
     background, history and  experiences.   The  Appellant's  difficulties
     began in 2001.  He was a university student in Bukavu, a town  at  the
     far eastern end of the Democratic Republic of Congo.  He was a  member
     of a political movement called Mudundu 40.  There was an  event  which
     appears in  some  sources  to  have  been  a  battle  between  student
     demonstrators and the de facto forces in the area  controlled  by  the
     Rwandan-inspired RCD-Goma.  The Appellant said that as a result he had
     been detained by RCD-Goma for a month, during which period of time  he
     had suffered ill-treatment amounting to  torture.   He  was  released,
     however, after a month's detention.  On 6 April 2002, according to the
     Appellant's original account, there were further difficulties and  the
     Appellant, fearing for his safety, left  home.   He  was  subsequently
     told by his brother that there  was  a  summons  for  him  to  present
     himself to the authorities of the Sixth Brigade.  There is some  doubt
     about the date, because in other evidence before the  Adjudicator  and
     before us the date of the summons appears to be in the spring of 2003.
      No point on this was taken before us, and we think that the truth  of
     the matter, as accepted by the Adjudicator, is  that  the  Appellant's
     most recent difficulties arose in 2003.

  4. As we have said, the Adjudicator accepted the Appellant's history.  In
     doing so, he declined to consider at  the  hearing  certain  documents
     which the Appellant's agent proposed to put before him in the form  of
     translations only.  As indicated in the note to the interlocutor which
     we have set out above, the fault may well have been that of the agent.

  5. The Adjudicator's conclusion was that the Appellant did indeed have  a
     well-founded fear of persecution and of treatment contrary to  Article
     3 in his own home area in the far east of the Democratic  Republic  of
     Congo,  around  Bukavu.   The  Adjudicator  held,  however,  that  the
     Appellant could readily obtain protection and would not be at risk  in
     Kinshasa.  Kinshasa is of course the capital:  it is at the  far  west
     of the Democratic Republic  of  Congo,  some  1,000  miles  away  from
     Bukavu.   Further,  the  objective  evidence  demonstrates  that   the
     government in Kinshasa is and always has been opposed to RCD-Goma and,
     indeed, the Appellant's own faction Mudundu 40 is itself recognised as
     an opponent of RCD-Goma.

  6. As is apparent from what we have set out above, the grant of Statutory
     Review was on the basis that the Adjudicator's decision not to look at
     the  translations  he  was  offered  was  something  which,  in   Lady
     Cosgrove's view, might have affected his decision on the viability  of
     internal relocation.  That is because internal relocation is likely to
     be much less viable if the  persecution  feared  by  the  claimant  is
     persecution which derives in essence from state authorities.  A number
     of documents were produced before us.   It  is  not  absolutely  clear
     which of them are the documents which the Adjudicator was  offered  in
     translation.  We have no reason to suppose  that  they  were  not  all
     available to the Appellant's agent at that time and for  that  reason,
     although we saw originals of only two of them and photocopies  of  the
     others,  we  have  taken  them  all  into  account   in   making   our
     determination.  As we pointed out to Mr  Bryce,  who  represented  the
     Appellant before us, a number of them have features which might  cause
     some doubts about their reliability.  Putting those doubts  aside  for
     the moment, we are concerned primarily with two  documents  which  the
     Appellant refers to  his  detention  and  subsequent  summons  by  the
     authorities in his home area.   Each  of  them  is  headed  "Repubique
     Democratique  du  Congo,  Armee   Nationale   Congolaise,   6�   [sic]
     Brigade/Bukavu, Etat-Major Commandement, Section 3".

  7. The first of them is dated 25 August 2001 and is  the  record  of  the
     Appellant's release on bail following his detention for  a  number  of
     matters including spying.  The second is headed "Convocation"  and  is
     the 2003 summons to which the Appellant referred  as  the  approximate
     cause of him leaving his home country.

  8. Our task in this reconsideration is primarily  to  determine,  on  the
     basis of the grounds upon which Statutory Review was granted,  whether
     the Adjudicator made an error of law which was material in  the  sense
     prescribed by Rule 31(5).  We are  content  for  present  purposes  to
     assume that the Adjudicator erred in declining under any circumstances
     to consider the translated documents.  We then go on  to  decide  what
     the position would have been if he had had before  him  the  documents
     that we now have:  the question we  ask  ourselves  is  whether  those
     documents would have led him to the  view  that  the  authorities  the
     Appellant feared were in truth authorities motivated by the state.

  9. Mr Bryce's submission was that those documents were  headed  with  the
     description of an official arm of the state's forces:  on  their  face
     they appeared to demonstrate that the Appellant's troubles had  indeed
     the Congolese State as their source, not  merely  that  of  a  faction
     operative in the far east of the country.  Looked  at  on  their  face
     alone, that may be so:  but it would of course have been  quite  wrong
     for the Adjudicator to have looked at  those  documents  in  isolation
     from the rest of the evidence in the case.  As we have indicated,  the
     Appellant's account was that his troubles stemmed from RCD-Goma.   The
     documents to which we refer are documents which reinforce his  account
     of what happened to him.  It appears to us that  any  Adjudicator  who
     had looked at those documents would necessarily have reached the  view
     that the apparently official letter heading on those documents was the
     fa�ade under which the RCD-Goma faction  operated  in  Bukavu  at  the
     times in question.  Mr Bryce confirmed that there was nothing  in  the
     evidence before the Adjudicator to suggest the contrary.  Nor  do  any
     of the other documents to which we  made  reference  earlier  in  this
     determination, and which are merely personal to the Appellant, lead to
     any such  conclusion.   The  objective  evidence,  however,  tends  to
     confirm the view we adumbrate.  The  CIPU  Report  (the  October  2004
     version was before the Adjudicator) indicates that before 30 June 2003
     the country was essentially divided into three segments.  Kinshasa was
     in one and Bukavu in another.

 10. Looking at the matter as a whole, even if we were to accept  that  the
     Adjudicator made an error of law, there is  nothing  which  begins  to
     persuade us that if he had seen these documents he might have held the
     view that the Appellant was in truth sought by the government or would
     be at risk in Kinshasa.  Indeed, such a conclusion would have been  in
     contradiction to much of the evidence the  Adjudicator  accepted  from
     the Appellant about his history and the source of  his  troubles.   In
     the context of this case, the heading on these documents does  nothing
     more than give some local colour to the Appellant's story.

 11. Any error of law made by the Adjudicator was accordingly not material.
      We therefore affirm his determination dismissing this appeal.
