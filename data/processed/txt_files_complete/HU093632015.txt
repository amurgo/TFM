For the Appellant:     Ms Z Ahmad, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr M Murphy, Counsel instructed by Ashton Ross Law


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   I shall refer to the Respondent as the Appellant as he was  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal.  He is a citizen of Turkey and his date  of  birth
    is 13 March 1987.  On 15 November 2010 he was granted  leave  to  enter
    the UK until 15 May 2011 as a visitor.  On 1  April  2011  he  made  an
    application for leave to remain in the UK in order to establish himself
    in business under the European Community Association  Agreement  (ECAA)
    and this was granted until 7 April 2012.  On 20 March 2012 he  made  an
    application for further leave to remain in the UK and this was  granted
    until 7 April 2015.  On 27 March 2015 he applied for  indefinite  leave
    to remain under HC 510 and the Immigration Rules in force  in  1973  by
    virtue of the terms of ECAA and his  application  was  refused  by  the
    Secretary of State on 9 October 2015.  The Appellant appealed  and  his
    appeal was allowed by Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Maxwell  who
    decided that the decision of  the  Secretary  of  State  was  unlawful,
    following a hearing on 27 October 2016 ( in a decision dated 9 November
    2016).

2.   Permission was granted by Upper Tribunal  Judge  Frances  on  8  August
    2017.  Judge Frances concluded that it was arguable that the standstill
    clause did not apply  with  reference  to  R  (on  the  application  of
    Aydogdu) v Secretary of State for the Home Department (Ankara Agreement
    - family members - settlement) [2017] UKUT 167 where McCloskey J held:

         "The settlement of  migrant  Turkish  nationals  and  their  family
         members does not fall within the scope of the  'standstill  clause'
         in Article 41(1) of the Ankara Agreement (ECAA) additional protocol
         as  it  was  not  necessary  for  the  exercise   of   freedom   of
         establishment under Article 13.  Thus the status of  settlement  in
         the UK for such Turkish nationals and their family  members  cannot
         derive in any way from the ECAA or its additional protocol."

3.   In the Reasons for Refusal Letter the  Secretary  of  State  considered
    the application under the ECAA with reference to HC 510 which reads  as
    follows:

         "In deciding these matters account  is  to  be  taken  of  all  the
         relevant facts; the fact that the applicant  satisfies  the  formal
         requirements of these rules for  stay,  or  further  stay,  in  the
         proposed capacity is not conclusive in his favour.   It  will,  for
         example, be relevant whether the person has observed the time limit
         and conditions subject to which he was  admitted;  whether  in  the
         light of his character, conduct or associations it  is  undesirable
         to permit him to remain; whether he represents a danger to national
         security; or whether, if allowed to remain for the period for which
         he wishes to stay, he might not be returnable to another country."

4.   The Secretary of State  concluded  that  it  would  be  undesirable  to
    permit the Appellant  to  remain  in  the  UK  in  light  of  his  past
    criminality with reference to a conviction  on  29  November  2014  for
    sexual activity with a female child under the age of 16 for  which  the
    Appellant was sentenced to 26 weeks' imprisonment and ordered to pay  a
    victim surcharge of �80 and �500 compensation.  He was ordered  to  pay
    costs of �620 and put on the Sex Offenders Register  for  a  period  of
    seven years.  The  decision-maker  made  reference  to  new  sentencing
    thresholds which have replaced the assessment of criminality under  the
    Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 and specifically to pages 110  and
    11 of the "Business  Applications  under  the  Turkish  EC  Association
    Agreement Guidance" which relates to applications made on or  after  13
    December 2012 which reads as follows:

         "In line with the current sentencing thresholds you must refuse  an
         applicant who is applying for leave or indefinite leave  to  remain
         on or after 13 December  2012,  if  they,  'were  convicted  of  an
         offence and sentenced to imprisonment for less than twelve  months,
         and seven years has not passed since the end of the sentence'."


5.   The Secretary of State stated that having taken  into  account  all  of
    the circumstances of the Appellant's case,  she  was  not  prepared  to
    exercise discretion in the Appellant's favour,  in  the  light  of  his
    criminality. She concluded  that  the  application  was  refused  under
    paragraph 4 of HC 510 because it would be  undesirable  to  permit  the
    Appellant to remain in the UK in the light of  his  character,  conduct
    and  associations.   The  Secretary  of  State  did  not  consider  the
    Appellant's rights under Article 8 in the  absence  of  an  application
    having been made on that basis.

6.   The salient findings of the    judge can be found at paragraphs  4,  5,
    6 and 7 of the determination:

         "4.  In considering the seriousness of the offending behaviour I am
             mindful of the  Sentencing  Guidelines  in  relation  to  this
             offence.  It  is  unfortunate  that  the  Respondent  has  not
             furnished the Tribunal with an outline of  the  facts  of  the
             allegation.  What may be said however is that the  Court  must
             have been  of  the  view  that  the  offending  behaviour  was
             sufficiently serious as to pass the custody threshold and that
             there were no factors that might make the  suspension  of  the
             custodial sentence appropriate.  It is clear that  the  victim
             was working for the Appellant as an intern and  therefore  the
             offending behaviour would appear to entail a degree of  breach
             of trust and there is a significant age difference as  between
             the Appellant and the victim.


         5.   The Appellant claims to be an innocent man falsely accused  by
             an infatuated teenager  who  made  the  allegation  so  as  to
             destroy the Appellant's relationship with his girlfriend  (now
             wife) so as to make him start a relationship with  her.   That
             claim was tested and the Appellant was convicted  after  trial
             therefore the allegation  has  been  proved  to  the  criminal
             standard so that I am satisfied so  that  I  am  sure  of  his
             guilt.  His  continuing  denial  can  only  serve  to  further
             undermine his case.  Undoubtedly a conviction of this  nature,
             quite properly gives rise to great public concern however I am
             driven to the view that the  Respondent  has  approached  this
             decision in an inappropriate manner.


         6.   Further, in refusing the application,  the  Respondent  having
             identified the fact that the Appellant did  have  a  right  of
             appeal purported to limit this to the  extent  that  he  could
             only rely on Article 8 grounds if he made a fresh  application
             on this basis.  None of  the  Appellant's  circumstances  have
             been taken into account.  Given the date  of  the  application
             predates the changes in legislation, the Respondent was  wrong
             to dismiss any interference with  Article  8  rights  at  that
             stage without consideration of the factual matrix.


         7.   It is apparent the Respondent did  not  take  account  of  any
             factors whatever other than the guidance as set out above.  In
             doing so, I find she has fettered her discretion as  paragraph
             4 clearly requires a balancing exercise to be  undertaken  and
             no such exercise has been undertaken."

     To summarise  the  judge  concluded  that  the  decision  was  unlawful
    because the decision-maker fettered discretion because the Secretary of
    State did not take into account any factors other than the guidance and
    that the decision-maker did not conduct a balancing exercise. The judge
    concluded that the approach was not in accordance with paragraph  4  of
    HC 510.

7.   The grounds of appeal argue that there was nothing unlawful  about  the
    decision-maker applying the modern  guidance  to  decisions  where  the
    standstill clause in HC 510 applies and that the  crucial  question  is
    whether the Appellant has been subject to less favourable  restrictions
    than those in place in 1973 and it is argued that the Appellant in this
    case was not.

8.   The grant of permission drew the parties'  attention  to  the  case  of
    Aydogdu and indeed both representatives at the hearing before me agreed
    that the standstill clause does  not  apply  to  applications  of  this
    nature in the light of the  decision  and  to  this  extent  the  judge
    materially erred.  I accept that the appeal was heard prior to the case
    of Aydogdu and no criticism can be levied at the judge in this respect.
     The judge found that the Secretary of State was wrong to "dismiss  any
    interference with Article 8 rights," but did not go on to consider  the
    appeal under Article 8. In the light of the misapplication  of  the  HC
    510, the judge erred because the appeal  should  have  been  determined
    under Article 8. There is a failure by the judge to identify any  power
    available to him to allow the appeal on the basis he did. Neither party
    at the hearing before me was able to identify any relevant  power.  The
    judge materially erred in allowing the appeal. I set aside the decision
    to allow the appeal.

Notice of Decision

9.   I set aside the decision, having concluded that  the  judge  materially
    erred.  Having heard submissions on the issue of venue, the  appeal  is
    remitted  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  subject   to   the   following
    directions:

Directions

1.   It may be that the  Secretary  of  State  decides  to  make  a  further
    decision in the light of this decision. I cannot make an order that she
    does, but it would be a sensible way forward.

2.   Both parties are to serve skeleton arguments setting out the issues  no
    later than 21 days before the substantive appeal.

2.   The findings of the judge at [4] and [5] of the decision have not  been
    challenged and at this stage I do not see any  good  reason  for  going
    behind those  findings  in  respect  of  the  Appellant's  criminality.
    However, I do not seek to tie the  hands  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge determining the matter.

No anonymity direction is made.
