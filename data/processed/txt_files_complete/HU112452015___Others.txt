For the Appellant:      Mr S Karim of MA Consultants.
 For the Respondent:    Mr P Deller, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal by the appellants against a decision  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal issued  on  26  January  2017  dismissing  their  appeals
    against the decision of the respondent made on 5 November 2015 refusing
    them further leave to remain on the basis of their family  and  private
    life.

Background.

2.   The appellants are citizens of Nigeria. The first  appellant  was  born
    on January 1970 and the second appellant, his wife on April  1971.  The
    third and fourth appellants are their  children,  a  daughter  born  on
    January 2011 and a son on January 2008.

3.   The first and second appellants made an unlawful entry into the  UK  on
    31 December 2006 with the help  of  an  agent.  The  third  and  fourth
    appellants were both born in this  country.  On  8  December  2011  the
    appellants applied for leave to remain  on  human  rights  grounds  but
    their application was refused on 7  February  2013  with  no  right  of
    appeal. A further application was made on 18 November  2013  for  leave
    under the EEA grounds but this was refused on 13 January  2014.  On  13
    October 2015 the first appellant was served with notice as  an  illegal
    entrant and on 30 October 2015 a further application was made for leave
    to remain on the basis of their human rights.

4.   The application was refused for the reasons given by the respondent  in
    the decision letter dated 5 November 2015. She was not  satisfied  that
    the appellants were able to meet the requirements of  the  Rules  under
    appendix FM or the provisions of para 276 ADE(1)  or  that  there  were
    exceptional circumstances entitling them to a grant of leave to  remain
    outside the requirements of the Rules.

The Decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

5.   The appellants appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal.  The  judge  heard
    evidence from the first appellant and  at  [11]-[15]  he  recorded  the
    submissions of the representatives. He then set  out  his  findings  of
    fact as follows:

        "16.  The burden of  proof  is  on  the  appellants  and  the  civil
        standard  of  the  balance  of  probabilities  applies.  The   first
        appellant arrived in the UK  illegally  on  31  December  2006.  His
        children were born in the UK on 18 January 2006 and 30 January 2011.
        It is accepted on behalf of all the appellants that they cannot meet
        the family life requirements under appendix FM  of  the  Immigration
        Rules. I am satisfied that it is not unreasonable for  the  children
        to return to Nigeria as a family  unit  with  their  parents.  There
        would not be any significant obstacles to their parents returning to
        that country, where they have spent the  majority  of  the  previous
        life and the second appellant still has relations with whom  she  is
        in touch. This is also consistent with the respondent's  obligations
        to consider the children's welfare under S. 55 of the 1999 Act.


        17.   Nor are there  any  exceptional  or  compelling  circumstances
        which would justify consideration of their  claim  under  article  8
        ECHR outside the rules. In any event, for the same reasons it  would
        not be disproportionate for them to return to Nigeria even if I were
        to consider any claim under article 8 ECHR."

The Grounds of Appeal and the Error of law

6.   In the grounds of appeal it is argued that the  judge  failed  to  give
    adequate reasons for his findings on whether it was reasonable for  the
    children to relocate; conflated the issue of reasonableness  with  that
    of insurmountable obstacles; failed to consider  MA  (Pakistan)  [2016]
    EWCA Civ 705 and S.117B(6) of the 2002 Act and failed  to  give  proper
    consideration to whether the appellants could succeed under  article  8
    outside the Rules. Permission to appeal was granted by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal on the basis that  the  grounds  disclosed  properly  arguable
    points of law.

The Error of Law

7.   The respondent has indicated in her Rule 24 reply  that  she  does  not
    oppose the appellant's application for  permission  to  appeal.  It  is
    conceded that the First-tier Tribunal erred in law. This concession  is
    properly made. I am satisfied that the judge erred in law by failing to
    give adequate reasons particularly on the issue  whether  it  would  be
    reasonable for the children to return to Nigeria. Further, he failed to
    give adequate consideration to the best interests of  the  children  or
    properly to consider the provisions of s.117B(6) or  the  jurisprudence
    in MA (Pakistan). The errors are such that the proper course is for the
    decision to be set aside.

8.   Both representatives submitted that the appeal should  be  remitted  to
    the First-tier Tribunal. I am satisfied that this is the proper  course
    as it is agreed that there needs to be a full rehearing.

 Decision

9.   The First-tier Tribunal erred in law and the  decision  is  set  aside.
    The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a full hearing by
    a different judge.
