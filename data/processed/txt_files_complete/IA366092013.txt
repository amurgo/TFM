                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

Representation:

For the Appellant: In person
For the Respondent: Mr Smart, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS




     1. This is an appeal against a determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
        Judge Obhi  promulgated  on  18  March  2014  which  dismissed  the
        appellant's appeal against the refusal of leave to remain as a Tier
        4 (General) Student.


     2. The only issue here was finance. The appellant accepted  before  me
        that with his application to the respondent he  provided  only  his
        Barclays Bank account statements. He accepted  that  they  did  not
        show the requisite funds of ï¿½1,600 for the required period, 4  July
        2013 to 31 July 2013.


     3. The appeal really ends there as the challenge before me is  to  how
        Judge Obhi assessed further evidence which was  not  provided  with
        the  application  or  before  the  respondent  when  she  made  her
        decision. That evidence was not admissible following s.85A  of  the
        Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

     4. In any event, Judge Obhi did not err in her consideration  of  that
        evidence. The HBL Habib Bank  statement  is  stated  to  have  been
        printed out on 1 July 2013. It cannot show  funds  in  the  account
        between 1 July 2013 and 30 July 2013,  therefore.  Judge  Obhi  was
        correct to place no weight on this document.

Decision

     5. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal  does not disclose  an
        error on a point of law and shall stand.
