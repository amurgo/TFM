                            DECISION AND REASONS

     1. This is an appeal against the decision of Judge of  the  First-tier
        Tribunal E.B.  Grant  (FtJ),  promulgated  on  26  September  2016,
        dismissing the Appellant's appeal against the Respondent's decision
        of 19 May 2015 refusing his human rights claim.


   Factual Background


     2. The Appellant is a national of Pakistan, date of birth 10 May 1987.
        He entered the UK on the 23 July 2011 as a student but  this  leave
        was curtailed with immediate effect on the 1 December 2013. He made
        an application on 24 November 2014 for leave to remain on the basis
        of his private and family life but this  application  was  refused,
        with no right of appeal, on 17 February 2015. On  18  May  2015  he
        made a further human rights claim based  primarily  on  his  family
        life relationship with WK, the son of his ex-partner (she was also,
        at that time, carrying his unborn biological child, T).

     3. The Respondent considered a number of documents provided in support
        of the application. These included child contact agreements between
        the Appellant and his ex-partner in respect  of  both  WK  and  the
        unborn  child.  Whilst  accepting  that  the  Appellant   met   the
        suitability requirements under Appendix FM of the immigration rules
        the Respondent concluded that the Appellant  did  not  satisfy  the
        definition of stepfather contained  in  the  immigration  rules  as
        there was no evidence that W.K.'s biological  father  was  deceased
        and there was no evidence that the Appellant had  adopted  WK.  The
        Respondent  noted  that  the  child  contact  agreements  were  not
        attested or sworn before a public notary and did not consider  them
        binding  agreements  or  a  true  indication  of  the   Appellant's
        relationship with W.K. The  Respondent  did  not  accept  that  the
        evidence provided by the Appellant indicated he had a  genuine  and
        subsisting relationship with W.K. or that he intended to  undertake
        an active role in his upbringing. The  Respondent  then  considered
        the application under paragraph 276ADE of the immigration rules but
        concluded that there were no  very  significant  obstacles  to  the
        Appellant's  integration  in  Pakistan.  Finally   the   Respondent
        considered whether there were exceptional circumstances that  might
        warrant a grant of leave to remain outside of the immigration rules
        in accordance with her duties under section 6 of the  Human  Rights
        Act and article 8  ECHR.  The  Respondent  relied  on  her  earlier
        findings  that  there  was  no  genuine  relationship  between  the
        Appellant and WK, and that even if there was  such  a  relationship
        there was no information to demonstrate that the child would suffer
        any detriment following the Appellant's removal from the UK.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal

     4.  The  FtJ  heard  oral  evidence  from  the  Appellant  which   was
        supplemented by a bundle running to 253 pages. The FtJ  considered,
        inter alia, a detailed statement from the Appellant,  an  affidavit
        from his  ex-partner,  and  a  Common  Assessment  Framework  (CAF)
        assessment undertaken by the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham
        in respect of WK (and which also made reference to  T,  born  on  2
        June 2015) which was dated 25 April 2016. The FtJ quoted at  length
        from both the Appellant's statement and the CAF assessment.


     5.  The  FtJ  concluded  that  the  Appellant  could  not   meet   the
        requirements of the immigration rules in relation to WK because  he
        did not meet the definition of a parent. The judge found, and  this
        was  not  in  dispute,  that  the  Appellant  did  not  have   sole
        responsibility for either WK or T. With reference to E-LTRPT.2.3 of
        Appendix-FM the judge noted that  the  Appellant  was  required  to
        demonstrate he had access rights to the relevant child and that  he
        had to provide evidence that he was taking and intended to continue
        to take an active role in the child's upbringing.


     6. When considering the CAF assessment the  FtJ  concentrated  on  the
        'actions required' section and noted the absence of any mention  of
        any role being undertaken by the Appellant either in regard  to  WK
        or T. The FtJ emphasised the absence of any role  ascribed  to  the
        Appellant in relation to either child's development and  concluded,
        given  the  very  concerning  Social  Services'  finding  that  the
        children's mother was an inadequate and neglectful parent, that the
        Appellant was not taking and did not intend to take an active  role
        in the children's upbringing.


     7. The FtJ noted a letter from WK's school stating that the  Appellant
        attended  meetings  and  parent   evenings   and   undertook   some
        responsibilities for WK including picking him up  from  school  and
        engaging  with  staff   regarding   WK's   academic,   social   and
        communication difficulties. The FtJ then stated that there  was  no
        credible evidence that when not taking WK to and from school he was
        with T taking an active role in his son's life.


     8. The FtJ considered the "contact agreements" regarding the  children
        but found that these documents were not the  result  of  any  order
        made by the Family Court and, in the absence of the Appellant's ex-
        partner at the hearing, the  FtJ  attached  little  weight  to  the
        agreements. The FtJ exclaimed that it was most surprising that  the
        Appellant  has  not  sought  to  formalise  the   claimed   contact
        arrangements in the Family Court given the existing social services
        involvement with his  ex-partner  and  the  children  and  drew  an
        adverse inference as to his credibility from his failure to do so.


     9. The FtJ went on to consider the Appellant's oral evidence vis-�-vis
        the financial documents contained  in  his  bundle.  The  FtJ  drew
        adverse inferences from the lack of any credible explanation  given
        by the Appellant for various large sums being  deposited  into  his
        account. The FtJ stated that, despite receiving large sums of  cash
        from unidentified sources  in  multiple  amounts  every  month  the
        Appellant gave very little to his ex-partner and the children.  The
        FtJ went so far as to suggest that the regular cash  deposits  were
        suggestive of money laundering or the  proceeds  of  some  criminal
        enterprise.


    10. Having found the Appellant was not credible the FtJ concluded  that
        there was insufficient evidence that he was an  active  parent  who
        met the requirements of the immigration rules. At paragraph 24  the
        FtJ stated,


             I have considered whether there are circumstances which  merit
             consideration of the appeal  on  A8  grounds  outside  of  the
             immigration rules and  I  decline  to  do  so.  There  are  no
             particular circumstances and it can be  seen  the  immigration
             rules provide a complete code for the A8 assessment within the
             rules as the parent of a British child.


    11. The appeal was dismissed.

The grounds of appeal and submissions of the parties

    12. Permission to appeal was sought on several grounds but  granted  by
        the Upper Tribunal on only one ground. The Appellant contended that
        the FtJ refused to accept the contact agreements on the basis  that
        they were not the result of any order made in the Family Court, but
        this was not  a  requirement  in  the  immigration  rules  and  was
        contrary to the Respondent's published  policy  'Family  Migration:
        Appendix FM Section 1.0b Family Life (as a Partner or  Parent)  AND
        Private Life: 10-Year Routes August 2015'. Given that the Appellant
        provided a sworn  affidavit  from  his  estranged  partner  it  was
        submitted that the FtJ's failure to accord adequate weight  to  the
        contact agreements constituted an error of law. It was additionally
        submitted that the FtJ failed to  sufficiently  analyse  or  accord
        adequate weight to the CAF report. The Deputy Upper Tribunal  Judge
        granting  permission  concluded  that  this  ground  did   disclose
        arguable errors of law both in relation to the  FtJ's  analysis  of
        the CAF report and in light of the contents of that report  and  as
        to the affidavit from the Appellant's estranged wife  in  light  of
        the relevant policy.

    13. At the hearing Ms Iqbal expanded upon the  grounds.  She  submitted
        that the FtJ erred in law by failing to give weight to  the  parent
        agreements which were duly sworn in the presence of witnesses.  The
        CAF assessment was written with the focus on WK  and  his  mother's
        ability to be an effective parent. The contact order and the letter
        from  WK's  School,  in  combination  with  the   CAF   assessment,
        accurately reflected the high level of involvement by the Appellant
        in WK's life. It was submitted that WK's  best  interests  were  to
        have the Appellant present to give him emotional support given  the
        detachment of his mother.


    14. Mr Avery submitted that the relevant policy provided  guidance  but
        that the degree of the Appellant's involvement  with  the  children
        was a matter for the FtJ to determine on the  particular  facts  of
        the case. The CAF assessment looked at the developing  relationship
        between the child and his  mother  and  the  FtJ  was  entitled  to
        conclude that the Appellant was not taking an active role.

    15. I indicated at the conclusion of the hearing that I  was  satisfied
        the FtJ materially erred in law by  failing  to  adequately  engage
        with the content of the CAF report, by misdirecting herself  as  to
        the appropriate legal test for assessing  article  8  relationships
        outside the immigration rules, and for drawing an adverse inference
        in circumstances where she was not entitled to do so.


      Discussion

    16. As disclosed in the extensive extracts replicated by the FtJ in her
        decision  the  CAF  assessment  made  numerous  references  to  the
        Appellant's involvement in WK's life. This includes reference to WK
        securing a  positive  attachment  from  the  age  of  3�  with  the
        Appellant who was "still very  much  present  in  his  life",  WK's
        "stable and  positive  relationship"  with  the  Appellant  who  is
        described  as  a  "positive  and  nurturing  caregiver"   and   who
        encourages WK's mother to build a relationship with her son, and to
        the Appellant supporting WK's mother with "the additional parenting
        and caring role". Despite her extensive replication the FtJ  failed
        to engage adequately or at all with the  CAF  assessment  that  the
        Appellant and WK have  "a  strong,  stable  and  loving  attachment
        [which] inevitably has had a positive impact on WK's  development",
        and that the Appellant "provides practical, emotional and financial
        support to the family and engages with school  consistently."  This
        constitutes a failure to take account of relevant considerations or
        to give adequate reasons for rejecting clear evidence of  a  strong
        relationship.


    17. The FtJ considered that the absence  of  any  mention  in  the  CAF
        assessment of any role being undertaken  by  the  Appellant  either
        with regard to WK or T undermined  his  claimed  relationship  with
        those children. The CAF assessment however  was  not  prepared  for
        immigration matters, and was not focused on T or  his  relationship
        with the Appellant. Nor was it the purpose of the CAF assessment to
        consider in detail the Appellant's role vis-�-vis WK  by  reference
        to the term "active role" contained in the immigration rules.


    18. I am additionally concerned that  the  FtJ  concluded,  in  a  non-
        deportation appeal, that the immigration rules provide a  'complete
        code' for the assessment of article 8 interests. This is incorrect.
        The immigration rules have never constituted a complete code within
        the context of non-deportation related appeals (and it is now clear
        that they do not constitute  a  'complete  code'  even  within  the
        context of deportation appeals, see Hesham Ali (Iraq) (Appellant) v
        Secretary of State for the Home Department (Respondent) [2016] UKSC
        60). By concluding that there were  "no  particular  circumstances"
        outside of the immigration rules that may warrant a grant of  leave
        pursuant to article 8, the  FtJ  misdirected  herself  in  law  and
        failed  to  properly  consider  or  engage  with  the   clear   and
        unchallenged evidence in the CAF  assessment  suggesting  that  the
        Appellant did have a relationship with WK.


    19. I am additionally satisfied that the FtJ was not entitled  to  draw
        an adverse inference from the failure by the Applicant to formalise
        the contact arrangements with  the  Family  Courts  simply  because
        Social Services were involved WK. The Respondent's policy (referred
        to at [12] above) indicates that there is no need for  a  residence
        order or contact order to be provided as evidence of direct  access
        by a person to a child. A letter or sworn  affidavit  from  the  UK
        resident parent care of the child  is  sufficient.  The  fact  that
        there was involvement by  the  Social  Services  does  not  require
        intervention of the Family Courts or the issuance of a residence or
        contact order, and the decision by the Applicant and his ex-partner
        to not involve the Family Courts does not rationally reflect on the
        genuineness of the contact agreements. In these  circumstances  the
        FtJ was not lawfully entitled to draw an adverse inference based on
        the absence of any Court issued orders.


    20. Having identified material errors  of  law  both  parties  were  in
        agreement that the matter would need to be remitted to  the  First-
        tier  Tribunal  for  a  de  novo  hearing.  Such  an  approach   is
        particularly appropriate given the further evidence adduced by  the
        Applicant (and not considered by the Upper Tribunal in  the  'error
        of law' hearing') pointing to a reconciliation between him and  his
        ex-partner.
