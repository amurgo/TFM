Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms A Nizami, counsel.
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.    This is an appeal by the appellant against a decision  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal issued on 8 November 2018 dismissing his  appeal  against
    the respondent's decision of  20  July  2018  refusing  his  claim  for
    asylum.


Background


2.    The appellant is a citizen of Afghanistan born on 8 November  1992  in
    Sharana in Paktika province.  He arrived in the UK on 16  January  2018
    making a clandestine entry in the back of a lorry. He claimed asylum on
    31 January 2018.


3.    The basis of his claim is that over a two-year period he  was  engaged
    in an adulterous relationship with a married woman  but  on  22  August
    2017 he was caught engaging in sexual activity with her in the back  of
    his store by her sister-in-law.  Once he had been discovered,  he  fled
    to his village and then went to a friend in Ghazni. He left Afghanistan
    on 24 August 2017 travelling on foot to Pakistan.   He  then  travelled
    through a number of unknown countries and, eventually, an agent hid him
    in a lorry telling him that it would take him to the UK. He feared that
    he would be at risk from  both  the  authorities  and  the  Taliban  as
    someone who had committed adultery.

4.    The respondent's decision is set  out  in  the  Reasons  for  Decision
    annexed to the decision of 20 July 2018.  The respondent accepted  that
    the appellant was a national of Afghanistan but was not satisfied  that
    he had been discovered committing adultery or that for this  reason  he
    was wanted either by  the  Taliban  or  the  Afghan  authorities.   The
    respondent found that the appellant did not  qualify  for  humanitarian
    protection; he did not come within the private life of requirements  of
    the Rules and there were  no  exceptional  circumstances  justifying  a
    grant of leave outside the Rules.


The Hearing before the First-tier Tribunal

5.    The appellant appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  He  gave  oral
    evidence and was cross examined.  However, the judge said that,  having
    regard to the totality of the evidence, he had come to  the  conclusion
    that the appellant's story was a  fabrication  [40].   He  described  a
    number  of  aspects  of  his  account  as  highly  implausible  and  in
    particular his claim that he would be able to maintain a sexual  affair
    with a woman over a two-year period without having got caught  earlier,
    the fact that a married woman would have been permitted to  leave  home
    on as many occasions as he claimed simply to be with him and his  claim
    that on the last occasion when he was caught, he got his  employee  off
    the scene to prevent him informing the authorities of the affair [42].


6.    The judge went on to say that, even taking the  appellant's  claim  at
    its highest, he agreed with the respondent  that  any  prosecution  was
    unlikely to result in a conviction because four men had  not  witnessed
    the activity [47] and that the appellant could, in any event,  relocate
    to another part of the country if his fear was of the Taliban [48].  He
    said that he found it highly implausible that the  Taliban  would  take
    upon itself the responsibility of punishing the appellant when they had
    other targets to worry about and he had  committed  no  wrong  to  that
    organization, such that they would seek to track him  down  in  another
    part of the country [48].  In summary, the judge did  not  accept  that
    the appellant had engaged in an adulterous  relationship  nor  that  he
    would be the subject of adverse interest either from the authorities or
    the Taliban. The asylum claim was  accordingly  dismissed.   The  judge
    dealt briefly with the issue of humanitarian protection, saying at [56]
    that, given his factual conclusions, the appellant had not  shown  that
    he was entitled to such protection.


The Grounds of Appeal

7.    In the grounds of appeal, it is argued in  ground  1  that  the  judge
    erred in  his  approach  to  credibility  by  focusing  excessively  on
    plausibility and in ground 2 that he erred in  his  assessment  of  the
    risk on return by failing to consider the  objective  evidence  and  in
    particular the  UNHCR  Eligibility  Guidelines  on  the  risk  of  ill-
    treatment in situations of accusations of adultery.  In ground 3 it  is
    argued that  he  erred  by  failing  to  consider  internal  relocation
    properly, failing to apply country guidance and again  by  focusing  on
    plausibility and in ground 4 that he  erred  by  failing  to  make  any
    findings,  adequate  or  otherwise,  in  relation  to  the  claim   for
    humanitarian protection.


8.    Permission to appeal was granted by the First-tier  Tribunal  for  the
    following reasons:


         "The judge concluded that the appellant's evidence was not credible
         and that he would not be at risk on  return  to  Afghanistan.   The
         grounds take issue with the findings made by the  judge  contending
         over reliance  on  inherent  implausibility.   There  may  be  some
         arguable merit in this given the content of paragraphs 42-46 of the
         decision".


Consideration of the Issues

9.    I shall deal with each ground in turn.  In ground 1 it is argued  that
    the judge erred when assessing credibility in the  way  he  focused  on
    plausibility.  In her submissions Ms Nizami argued that the  judge  had
    viewed credibility solely through the  lens  of  plausibility  and  had
    fallen into the errors described in Y v Secretary of State [2006]  EWCA
    Civ 1223 and HK v Secretary of State [2006] EWCA  Civ  1037.  Mr  Tufan
    referred me to Gheisari v Secretary of State [2004] EWCA Civ  1854  and
    in particular [14].  He argued that  the  judge  had  reached  a  clear
    decision on credibility and had been entitled to take into account  the
    aspects of the evidence which he regarded as implausible.


10.   The Court of Appeal in Y and HK have set out the dangers of  an  over-
    reliance  on  inherent  implausibility.   They  warn   against   making
    assumptions based on a subjective view of what is or is not  plausible.
    In HK, Neuberger LJ said that in many asylum cases some, even most,  of
    the appellant's story may seem inherently unlikely but  that  does  not
    mean that it is untrue.  The ingredients of the story and the story  as
    a whole have to be considered against the available  country  evidence,
    reliable expert evidence and other familiar factors such as consistency
    with what an appellant has  said  previously  and  with  other  factual
    evidence where there is any.  In Gheisari, the Court  of  Appeal  again
    made the point that the fact that something is inherently unlikely does
    not mean that it must be untrue ([16] per Thomas LJ) but that  what  is
    required is an assessment of the truthfulness  and  reliability  of  an
    appellant's evidence against the background of the evidence as a  whole
    ([20] per Pill LJ).


11.   I am not satisfied that the judge erred by making  his  assessment  of
    credibility solely through the lens of plausibility or that  he  relied
    or  reached  his  credibility  findings  simply  on  implausibility  or
    inherent implausibility.  At [39] the judge reminded himself that  when
    making findings  on  credibility,  he  was  required  to  look  to  the
    background evidence relating to the country concerned and he noted that
    there was nothing inconsistent with the appellant's claim.  At [41], he
    said that having  regard  to  the  totality  of  the  evidence  he  had
    concluded that the appellant's story was a fabrication and he gave  his
    reasons in the following paragraphs.

12.   Firstly, he said that he  shared  many  of  the  reservations  of  the
    respondent whose reasons are set out  at  �40-65  of  the  Reasons  for
    Decision.  There was no need for the judge to repeat these and, in  any
    event, he had summarised the respondent's decision at [3]-[26]  of  his
    decision.  The judge went on to say that he found it highly implausible
    that the appellant would maintain a sexual affair with a woman  over  a
    two-year period without being caught earlier and  that  it  was  highly
    implausible a married woman would have been permitted to leave home  on
    as many occasions as the appellant claimed simply to be with him.

13.   The judge also commented [43] that such a relationship was  likely  to
    be a source of shame for both the appellant and the woman involved that
    it would have been plausible had the appellant claimed  that  both  she
    and he might be the victim of an honour  killing.   He  also  commented
    that in a society where sexual activity taking place  outside  marriage
    was so frowned upon, an aggrieved person's first point  of  call  would
    not be to the police as reporting the  incident  was  likely  to  bring
    greater shame than not doing so.  These were comments properly open  to
    the judge and, in any event, indicate that his assessment of  what  may
    or may not be plausible was in the context of society  and  culture  in
    Afghanistan.

14.   The judge was entitled to take issues  of  plausibility  into  account
    when assessing credibility.  It is clear that he  was  making  his  own
    evaluation of the veracity of the account,  taking  into  consideration
    not only plausibility but also  consistency  [39].   He  was  entitled,
    having considered the evidence for himself, to agree with some  of  the
    concerns raised by the respondent.   I  am  satisfied  that  the  judge
    reached findings of fact properly open to him for the reasons  he  gave
    and that he did not fall into the error of equating  plausibility  with
    credibility.

15.   Ground 2 seeks to challenge the  judge's  assessment  of  whether  the
    appellant would be at risk on return.  As ground 1 does not succeed, it
    follows that there is nothing in ground 2 that has any material bearing
    on the outcome of the appeal.  Even if the judge underestimated how the
    authorities or, more likely, the Taliban might react in response to  an
    accusation of adultery, that issue does not arise as the appellant  has
    failed to establish the factual basis of his claim.

16.   Ground 3 seeks to challenge the findings on internal  relocation  but,
    in the absence of any need to  relocate,  any  error  has  no  material
    bearing on the outcome of the appeal.


17.   Ground 4 argues  that  the  judge  made  no  finding  in  relation  to
    humanitarian protection but that is incorrect as  the  judge  did  make
    such a finding.  He gave no further reasons save that, in the light  of
    his factual conclusions, the  appellant  had  not  shown  that  he  was
    entitled to such protection.   The  grounds  refer  to  �30-31  of  the
    skeleton argument before the First-tier Tribunal which are  drafted  in
    general terms and refer to AK (Article 15(c)) Afghanistan  [2012]  UKUT
    00163. AS (Safety of Kabul) Afghanistan CG [2018] UKUT  00118  is  also
    referred to but in the context of sufficiency of protection.   However,
    the fact remains that, in the light of the judge's  findings  of  fact,
    the appellant failed to establish any sufficient evidential basis for a
    finding, taking into account those authorities, that  he  would  be  at
    risk  of  ill  treatment  on  return  entitling  him  to   humanitarian
    protection.

18.   I am not satisfied that the judge erred in law  for  the  reasons  set
    out in the grounds or otherwise.  He reached findings  and  conclusions
    properly open to him on the evidence for the reasons he gave.


Decision

19.   The First-tier Tribunal did  not  err  in  law  and  the  decision  to
    dismiss the appeal stands.

20.   The anonymity order made by the First-tier Tribunal remains  in  force
    until further order.
