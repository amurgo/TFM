                           DECISION AND DIRECTION

 1. On 17 February 2021, the Upper Tribunal issued a  preliminary  decision
    (dated 9 February 2021) indicating that as the respondent had  conceded
    an error of law in the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  such  that
    the decision had to be remade de  novo,  the  parties  should  indicate
    within 7 days whether they objected  to  the  remaking  of  the  appeal
    taking place in the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. Both parties have indicated that they agree that the  remaking  of  the
    appeal should take place in the First-tier Tribunal. The Upper Tribunal
    therefore confirms that there is an error of law  in  the  decision  of
    First-tier  Tribunal  P  M  Hands  for  the  reasons  set  out  in  the
    preliminary decision, sets the First-tier Tribunal decision  aside  and
    remits the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal for remaking de novo.
