                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr Caskie, instructed by Maguire Solicitors
(Scotland).
For the Respondent:    Mr A Govan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants are nationals of Pakistan.  They appealed to the  First-
    tier Tribunal against decisions of the respondent on  25  January  2018
    refusing the first appellant's  application  for  indefinite  leave  to
    remain on the grounds of ten years lawful residence, and  on  16  April
    2018 refusing the second appellant's  application  under  Appendix  FM.
    Judge Gillespie dismissed their  appeals.   They  now  appeal  to  this
    Tribunal, with permission.


 2. As the second appellant's claim is as a  family  member  of  the  first
    appellant, it is clear that these appeals stand or fall  together.   In
    what follows, references to "the appellant" are to the first appellant.
     His application was refused under paragraph 322(5) of the Statement of
    Changes in Immigration Rules, HC 395 (as amended).


 3. This is an 'earnings discrepancy' case.  Three such cases were  in  the
    Tribunal's list on a single day.  They are not  otherwise  linked,  but
    the legal principles are the same in each case.   Thus,  the  following
    analysis appears in each of the judgments.


 4. In these cases, the appeal is against the refusal of  indefinite  leave
    to remain on the basis of ten years' lawful residence, under  paragraph
    276B of the Statement of Changes  in  Immigration  Rules,  HC  395  (as
    amended).  The reason for the refusal is not that the applicant did not
    meet the basic requirements of  paragraph  276B,  but  on  one  of  the
    'General  Grounds  for  Refusal',  paragraph  322(5).   That  paragraph
    indicates that leave 'should normally be refused' on the ground of:


         "the undesirability of permitting the person concerned to remain in
         the  United  Kingdom  in  the  light  of  his  conduct   (including
         convictions which do not fall within paragraph 322(1C)),  character
         or associations or the fact that he represents a threat to national
         security."


 5. Among the various ways in which a  person  may  accumulate  ten  years'
    lawful residence, some, including in particular, presence in the United
    Kingdom under the points-based system as a  Tier  1  (General)  Migrant
    ("T1GM"), will have required the person concerned to obtain  extensions
    of leave.  The applications for the extensions  in  turn  required  the
    applicant to declare a particular level of earnings.  The next steps in
    the story so far as the Home Office is concerned are set out as follows
    by Underhill LJ,  giving  the  judgment  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  in
    Balajigari and others v SSHD [2019] EWCA Civ 673:


         "4. The Home Office became concerned that there  was  a  widespread
         practice of applicants for leave  to  remain  as  a  T1GM  claiming
         falsely inflated earnings, particularly  from  self-employment,  in
         order to appear to meet the required  minimum;  and  from  2015  it
         began to make use of its powers under section 40 of the UK  Borders
         and Immigration Act 2007 to obtain information from  Her  Majesty's
         Revenue  and  Customs  ("HMRC")  about  the  earnings  declared  by
         applicants in their tax returns  covering  the  equivalent  period.
         This information disclosed significant  discrepancies  in  a  large
         number of cases. It also revealed what appeared to be a pattern  of
         taxpayers who had in earlier years submitted  tax  returns  showing
         earnings that attracted little or no liability to tax  subsequently
         submitting amended returns showing much higher levels of  earnings,
         over the required minimum, in circumstances  which  suggested  that
         they  were  aware  that  the   previous   under-declaration   might
         jeopardise a pending application for leave to  remain.  There  were
         also instances of returns being submitted belatedly where none  had
         been submitted at the time and where an application for  leave  was
         pending ....


         5.   It has been Home Office practice to  refuse  applications  for
         ILR in all, or in any event the  great  majority  of,  cases  where
         there are substantial discrepancies between the earnings originally
         declared to HMRC by a T1GM applicant (even if subsequently amended)
         and the earnings declared in the application for ILR or a  previous
         application for leave to  remain  ("earnings  discrepancy  cases"),
         relying on the "General Grounds for  Refusal"  in  Part  9  of  the
         Immigration Rules. Initially it relied  specifically  on  paragraph
         322 (2), which applies in cases where an applicant has made a false
         representation in relation to  a  previous  application.  Latterly,
         however,  it  has  relied,  either  additionally  or  instead,   on
         paragraph 322 (5), which embraces more general misconduct....


         6.  It is the  Secretary  of  State's  case  that  his  policy  and
         practice is only to rely on paragraph 322  (5)  where  he  believes
         that  an  earnings  discrepancy  is  the   result   of   deliberate
         misrepresentation either to HMRC or to the Home  Office,  in  other
         words only where it is the result of dishonesty. But a large number
         of migrants have claimed that in their cases errors which were  the
         result only of carelessness or ignorance have wrongly been  treated
         as dishonest, and that the Home Office has been too ready  to  find
         dishonesty without an adequate evidential basis or a fair procedure
         ...."


 6. In Balajigari, the Court had before it cases where  the  challenge  had
    been by way of Judicial Review, because there was no  right  of  appeal
    against the decisions taken by the Secretary of State.  It considered a
    range of arguments in support of the  challenges.   It  concluded  that
    paragraph 322(5) is not limited to cases of criminal  conduct,  threats
    to national security, war crimes or travel bans (para  [31]),  although
    the dishonest submission of false figures to either the Home Office  or
    HMRC would be criminal conduct  (para  [37(3)]).   Thus  the  paragraph
    could properly and lawfully be deployed against a person who  had  made
    different statements of his income for the purposes of obtaining  leave
    and for the purposes of tax (para [35]).  But the  applicant's  conduct
    must be dishonest in the Adedoyin v SSHD [2010] EWCA Civ 773 sense:  it
    was not enough simply to show that the statements (or one  or  more  of
    them) were factually  inaccurate.   Further,  the  misconduct  must  be
    sufficiently serious to merit refusal in these terms: 'the rule is only
    concerned with conduct of a serious character'; but again the dishonest
    and deliberate submission of false  earnings  figures  would  meet  the
    threshold, wherever that were to be pitched (para [37(2)]).


 7. The Secretary of State is not bound  to  make  further  enquiries  with
    HMRC, and the lack of action by HMRC does not conclude  the  matter  in
    the applicant's favour (paras [67], [72], [76]).  Procedural  fairness,
    however, requires that the applicant be given notice of  the  Secretary
    of State's suspicion, and a proper opportunity to meet  any  allegation
    of dishonesty and to put forward any other reason  why  if  there  were
    dishonesty it should not in the present case  lead  to  refusal  (paras
    [55]-[56]).  If that is done, the Secretary of State  is  not  required
    simply to accept an assertion that there has  been  an  honest  mistake
    (para [106]).  The Court endorsed at [40] the general guidance given by
    Martin Spencer J in R (Shahbaz Khan) v SSHD [2018] UKUT 00384 (IAC)  at
    [37(iv)-(vii)], which adds that the Secretary of State is  to  look  at
    the explanations given, will expect evidence supporting them, and  will
    and consider  them  in  context,  for  example  in  the  light  of  the
    applicant's knowledge and what was done to remedy the error  and  when.
    Further, the Secretary of State is not required to accept an  assertion
    of an error  made  by  an  accountant,  but  again  will  consider  the
    evidenced facts about the applicant's dealings with the accountant.


 8. The burden of proof of showing dishonesty  lies  on  the  Secretary  of
    State, the standard being the balance of probabilities (Balajigari para
    [43]).   The  question  is  whether  there  is  a   credible   innocent
    explanation for the discrepancy: is the applicant  merely  careless  or
    does the evidence show him to have been dishonest?  There will then  be
    in principle a second issue  of  whether  paragraph  322(5)  should  be
    applied or not, given that it is discretionary, because  there  may  be
    factors outside article 8 that might impact on whether  leave  of  some
    sort should be granted (para [39], but see para [20]).


 9. The Court also concluded that a decision to refuse leave on this  basis
    would be likely to involve an interference with article 8 rights, which
    would need separate examination.  Because both Balajigari and Khan were
    judicial review cases, there were procedural  issues  relating  to  the
    possibility of raising an article 8 issue not advanced previously,  and
    adducing  further  evidence.   I  am  not  concerned  here  with  those
    considerations.  What is important for present purposes  is  the  clear
    decision justifying treatment of a refusal in cases of this sort  as  a
    refusal raising human rights issues.  It is that part of  the  decision
    that has led the Secretary of State now to make decisions incorporating
    a refusal on human rights grounds, as  the  Court  indicated  would  be
    possible (para [102]) and perhaps desirable.  Those decisions  carry  a
    right of appeal under s 82(1)(b).


10. All the Balajigari appellants succeeded because the Court held that  in
    each case the Secretary of State's decision-making was at fault and the
    decisions could therefore not stand.  In three of the cases  there  had
    been no  opportunity  to  rebut  what  amounted  to  a  presumption  of
    dishonesty arising from the figures alone; in the fourth case there had
    been an opportunity, but no finding of dishonesty.  In one of the cases
    the decision to refuse leave was quashed by the Court;  in  the  others
    the question was remitted to the Upper  Tribunal  for  redetermination,
    but the inquiry and the remedy  were  limited  to  those  available  in
    judicial review.


11. In these appeals Mr Govan for the Secretary of State  argues  that  the
    appeals process itself gives an opportunity to put all  relevant  facts
    before a judge, and that  the  procedural  difficulties  faced  by  the
    Secretary of State in the Balajigari cases do not  arise.   Subject  to
    one important reservation, I agree.  The landscape of  appeal  is  very
    different from that  of  judicial  review.   The  appeal  is  for  most
    purposes limited to human rights grounds, but  there  needs  to  be  an
    examination of whether the appellant ought to have succeeded under  the
    Rules.   Thus  there  is  room  for  a  factual  investigation  of  the
    appellant's  acts  and  motives  and  whether  paragraph   322(5)   was
    applicable to him.  There is also a full opportunity for evidence to be
    adduced and considered, whether or not it has been deployed previously,
    on both the underlying events and any present factors going to  article
    8.  What is more, there is no free-standing ground of appeal  that  the
    decision was not in accordance with the law.


12. These points make it clear that where there is an appealable  decision,
    the role of the appellant and the Tribunal  will  be  to  undertake  an
    examination of the evidence and decide whether the  refusal  should  be
    upheld or struck out, not on the grounds applicable in judicial review,
    but on determination of all the relevant  facts.   The  appeal  process
    fills both the gaps  identified  by  the  Court  in  Balajigari  -  the
    procedural  fairness  gap  because  the  appeal  gives   the   relevant
    opportunity, and the article 8 gap because the appeal  encompasses  the
    human rights issues.  By the end of an appeal process the appellant has
    had every opportunity to put his case.


13. I note, of course, what the Court said in Balajigari at paragraphs [59]-
    [61], that the opportunity to make submissions only  after  a  decision
    has been made will usually be insufficient to meet the requirements  of
    procedural fairness.  But, for a number of reasons, I do not think that
    those observations can be taken as applying to appeals  of  this  sort.
    First, they were specifically made in the context of  judicial  review,
    by reference to leading authorities on judicial review  and  procedural
    fairness,  and  including  observations  about  the  limited  role   of
    statutory administrative review, which is available only where there is
    no  right  of  appeal.   Secondly,  it  is  not  easy  to  detect   any
    reservations  of  this  sort  in  the  Court's  consideration  of   the
    possibility of affording a right of appeal in part C of its decision at
    [95]-[106], where the scope of its  observations  would  appear  to  be
    severely limited if the underlying decision on the merits  were  to  be
    considered as potentially  unlawful  even  within  the  context  of  an
    appeal.  Thirdly, and most important, although  judicial  review  is  a
    remedy lying outside  any  specific  statutory  regime,  the  statutory
    regime itself includes  the  right  of  appeal.   Where  an  appealable
    decision is made the entire process, including the notification of  the
    decision to the individual, envisages the possibility of the correction
    of the decision by an appeal.  In  this  sense,  the  decision  is  not
    finally 'taken' until any appeal is over; and indeed,  judicial  review
    can have virtually no role until an appellant has exhausted  his  right
    to have the decision set aside on appeal.


14. I said above that there was one reservation.  It is this.   The  appeal
    process ought to provide an opportunity for an individual to raise  all
    the relevant matters he wishes to raise.  But it may not do so  if,  at
    the time the appeal is heard, there is a restriction  (imposed  by  the
    judge either of his own motion or from a current understanding  of  the
    law) which proves to have been itself unlawful.  If the appeal  allowed
    the appellant to raise questions going in substance to whether  he  was
    dishonest, the appeal to that extent will have  filled  the  procedural
    unfairness gap even if that was the first opportunity he  had;  but  if
    the appeal proceeded on the basis that the figures gave rise themselves
    to a presumption of dishonesty, it may be that the evidence adduced was
    in practice curtailed by what it was thought might be a possible ground
    of challenge.  Each  case  is  likely  to  depend  on  its  facts.   In
    particular, if all the evidence going to the issue was in fact adduced,
    a judge's error in the application of the law to that evidence will not
    necessarily prevent the Upper Tribunal from correcting  the  error  and
    substituting a decision on the basis of the evidence.  But  it  is  not
    difficult to envisage cases where a misunderstanding of the  law  might
    require there to be an opportunity to take further evidence.  For these
    reasons it cannot be said that in every case the actual appeal provided
    all the opportunities to which  the  appellant  was  entitled  by  law,
    although the general position is that the appeal process satisfies  the
    demands of procedural fairness.


15. I turn now to the facts of the present appeal.


16. In the present case  the  appellant's  income  was,  in  the  years  in
    question, derived (except for a small amount) from his partnership in a
    family business, A & S Properties of Perth.  According to the  material
    produced by the  Secretary  of  State,  (including  documentation  from
    HMRC), the discrepancies were as follows.  In March 2011, as part of an
    application for leave to remain, the appellant  claimed  an  income  of
    �40,074.00 from all sources.  His tax  return  for  that  year,  ending
    three weeks later, showed total income of �21,782.00 from all  sources.
    In an application for leave to remain made 5 June 2013,  the  appellant
    claimed to have an income of �41,289.00 from all sources between 1 July
    2012 and 27 May 2013.  The appellant's tax return for the year ending 5
    April 2013 showed a total income received of �26,000.00, all from self-
    employment.


17. The appellant has subsequently amended  his  tax  returns  to  coincide
    (more or less: there is  a  difference  of  a  few  hundred  pounds  in
    relation to the earlier return) with the  figures  he  claimed  in  his
    applications for leave to remain.  The respondent takes the  view  that
    the appellant deliberately and dishonestly provided  different  figures
    to the two government departments in order to secure the advantages  of
    obtaining leave but paying less tax.


18. The appeals of the appellant and his wife were heard by Judge Gillespie
    on 20 September 2018.  Mr Bryce represented  the  appellants,  and  had
    prepared a full skeleton argument, based to an extent on,  and  citing,
    Khan.  There was oral and written evidence from the appellant, from the
    partnership's accountant, Mr Stewart Tough FCCA, and from  one  of  the
    other partners, Afzal Noor Muhammad.  The judge's decision contains his
    conclusions about the evidence he  heard.   It  was  challenged  by  Mr
    Bryce, who drafted the grounds of appeal, on the basis that  the  judge
    appeared to have ignored his written skeleton argument, which  set  out
    the basis for distribution of the profits of the partnership.  What is,
    however, clear is that the judge took the view  that  it  was  for  the
    appellant to discharge the burden of proof by showing that he  had  not
    been dishonest.  As Balajigari shows, that was not correct.   In  these
    circumstances it is  clear  that  the  judge  erred  in  law.   As  the
    application for permission proposed that if the  judge's  decision  was
    set aside, the decision on the appeal ought to be  made  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal, there being no real issues of fact to determine, I  indicated
    at the beginning of the hearing that I would set aside the decision for
    error of law; and  Mr Caskie and Mr Govan thereupon made submission  on
    the impact of the evidence.


19. There are two elements of the grounds which, as it seems to me, have no
    bearing on the outcome of the appeal, and I  deal  with  them  straight
    away.  First, Mr Bryce submits  that  the  Secretary  of  State  is  in
    difficulties in this case because the original applications  for  leave
    to remain have not been produced.  I can understand that there might be
    some cases where that would be of importance, but this is  not  one  of
    them: as Mr Bryce also submits,  there  is  no  real  doubt  about  the
    external facts in this case.  Secondly, it is suggested  that,  because
    the appellant adjusted his tax returns, with the result that there  has
    been no financial loss to HMRC in the end, that in some  way  mitigates
    the appellant's position.  It is true that it does mean that he is  not
    liable,  as  he  otherwise  would  be,  to  further   proceedings   for
    underpayment of tax.  It does not, however, affect the position at  the
    time the various statements were made.  The question  is  whether  they
    were dishonest then.


20. Dealing first with the events  relating  to  the  2011  tax  year,  the
    appellant's clear evidence is that his share of the partnership profits
    for that year was two thirds, leaving only  one  third  for  the  other
    partners, Mr Afsal Muhammad and  his  wife.   The  relevant  two-thirds
    share was the amount that he claimed on his application  for  leave  to
    remain.  Mr Tough, the accountant, endorses that; he wrote a letter  at
    the time, which has been  produced,  indicating  that  the  appellant's
    share of the partnership profit for the period from 1 July  2010  to  8
    March 2011 was �40,074, of a total profit of �60,111.  In  his  written
    statement, Mr Tough  explains  that  the  reason  why  the  partnership
    profits were shared in that way  was  because  of  the  other  business
    interests of Mr and Mrs Afsal Muhammad, and for tax planning  purposes.
    Mr Afsal Muhammad agrees with the statements of the  appellant  and  Mr
    Tough.


21. So far as the tax return is concerned, the appellant says that  it  was
    prepared by Mr Tough,  who  acted  on  the  instructions  of  Mr  Afsal
    Muhammad.  He says that he had family difficulties  at  the  time,  and
    implies that he did not attend very closely  to  the  contents  of  the
    return.  Mr Tough refers to "the apportionment of the  profit  for  tax
    purposes".  Again, Mr Afsal Muhammad is content to  endorse  what  both
    the appellant and Mr Tough have said.


22. In the course of submissions on behalf of  the  appellant,  Mr  Bryce's
    position was that it was unlikely that the appellant had actually drawn
    the two thirds of the income to which he was entitled.  Tax,  he  said,
    had been paid  on  the  basis  that  one  third  of  the  profits  were
    attributable to each partner, not only for the tax year ending 5  April
    2011, but for subsequent tax years, apparently up to May 2016.


23. The explanation provided  at  one  stage  by  Mr  Bryce  that,  if  the
    appellant had a two-third share in the profits, he might not have drawn
    the whole of that share is irrelevant: he would still be liable to  tax
    on his share.  But the truth of the matter is that the  evidence  taken
    as a whole shows that the partners must have been complicit in what the
    accountant was doing, which was to prepare tax  returns  on  the  basis
    that the profits were shared equally, but  to  provide  other  evidence
    indicating that they were not.  Although it is said that the reason for
    the unequal distribution of profits was tax planning by Afsal  Muhammad
    and his wife, that would  have  completely  failed,  given  the  actual
    returns, reflecting equal distribution, made to HMRC.  Further,  if  it
    is right that there was an unequal distribution for this  purpose,  the
    fact that it had gone wrong would  be  quickly  apparent  to  Mr  Afsal
    Muhammad and his wife when they received  their  tax  bills.   On  this
    hypothesis, they would have agreed to allow the appellant to  have  two
    thirds of the partnership income in order to reduce  their  tax  bills,
    but would find that their tax bills were not reduced.  Given the  clear
    evidence of the declaration that was actually made for tax purposes,  I
    regard it as wholly incredible that there was an agreement between  the
    partners for unequal distribution of profits in order to avoid tax.  It
    follows, that the appellant's story, that he really did have an  income
    of �40,000 from the partnership,  but  had  not  appreciated  that  his
    income had been understated for tax purposes, cannot be the truth.


24. I do not need to investigate further where the truth  lies.   The  fact
    that the appellant has, in order to prepare himself for his application
    for indefinite leave to remain, made adjustments to  his  tax  returns,
    does not show that, in the years in question, he genuinely did have the
    income claimed for immigration purposes.  The position is that  in  the
    tax year 2011 there was a discrepancy, and  that  discrepancy  has  not
    even now been satisfactorily explained; in particular, the  explanation
    given by the appellant and those giving evidence on his behalf  is  not
    the truth.  I am wholly satisfied that the difference between  the  sum
    declared to HMRC and that claimed to the Secretary of State was knowing
    and deliberate, not accidental.


25. So far as the events of 2013 are concerned, the position is less clear,
    because the end of the period that was  relevant  for  the  immigration
    application was not near the end of a financial year.  In  relation  to
    the 2013 application and the 2013 tax return, the explanation given  is
    that the appellant was entitled, by agreement of the partners,  to  one
    half of the income of the  partnership.   Apart  from  that,  the  only
    difference is that the other partners would have by then had a  further
    two years to appreciate that the returns being made to the  tax  office
    and the tax they were paying did not reflect the agreed distribution of
    partnership income, if that was the case.  Again, I regard the  account
    of the agreement for the distribution of the income as  not  worthy  of
    credit.


26. I would regard either of the discrepancies identified  as  reasons  for
    the refusal of the  application  for  indefinite  leave  to  remain  as
    sufficiently serious to merit refusal under  paragraph  322(5)  if  the
    appellant was complicit.  I have found that he was complicit  in  both.
    For these reasons, I conclude that the decision under appeal was wholly
    merited.


27. This is, however, a human rights appeal.  The appellant  and  his  wife
    have family life together, and they have two children, one of which  is
    aged over seven and so is a "qualified child" within the meaning  of  s
    117D(1).  However, Mr Govan pointed  out  that  there  is  very  little
    evidence of that child's needs other than the medical needs  which  are
    on record; and there is no evidence that it would  be  unreasonable  to
    expect either of the children to leave the United Kingdom.  So  far  as
    the evidence adduced in this appeal, there is no article 8  reason  why
    this family, all citizens of Pakistan, should not be expected  to  live
    in Pakistan.


28. For the foregoing reasons  I  dismiss  the  appeal  of  the  appellant.
    Because his wife's appeal is dependent upon his, I dismiss  her  appeal
    also.
