                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


     1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a determination
        of First-tier Tribunal Judge  Pirotta,  promulgated  on  12th  June
        2014, in which she allowed the appeal under  both  the  Immigration
        Rules and Human Rights Convention.


     2. Mrs Hammond is a citizen of the United States of  America  born  on
        25th November 1975. She sought leave to enter as the  spouse  of  a
        British citizen Mr Philip Hammond. The application was  refused  on
        5th July 2013 on a number of grounds the only one of which was live
        before the Judge being that relating to the ability of Mrs  Hammond
        to satisfy the maintenance requirements.


     3. The Judge notes  some  confusion  regarding  exactly  who  was  the
        subject of the application in  the  mind  of  the  Entry  Clearance
        Officer (ECO) as a result of misleading information being  included
        in  the  application  form.  In   relation   to   the   maintenance
        requirements the Judge states in paragraph 19 of her determination:


     19.  The Sponsor has established in this appeal by  probative  evidence
     that the facts  are  as  stated  and  that  he  does  meet  the  income
      threshold  stipulated  in  Appendix  FM.  The  Sponsor  has  shown  an
   employment history, working  abroad  on  a  pattern  with  pay  which  is
   not liable to be taxed in  any  country,  accounts  show  his  fees  were
   sufficient to  meet  the  income  criteria  that  he  had  disclosed  all
     relevant information.


     4. In relation  to  the  human  rights  element  the  Judge  finds  in
        paragraph 22:


     22.  The decision to refuse entry on  the  basis  of  the  Appendix  FM
   criteria            was not unreasonable in the circumstances  when  made
   but the                 persistence of that decision is not proportionate
   as the  ambiguities            have  been  cleared  and  the  true  facts
   disclose the  parties  meet  the              threshold  for  income  and
   durability of the relationship. A further              refusal  in  these
   circumstances would unlawfully interfere  with  the            Article  8
   rights  to  private  and  family  life   of   the   Appellant   and   the
   Sponsor.


     5. The Secretary of State seeks to appeal  this  decision  on  grounds
        which can be summarised as follows: (a) there is a lack of  clarity
        on  exactly  what  basis  the  Judge  found  the  requirements   of
        Immigration Rules to be  satisfied  including  failure  to  provide
        adequate reasons as to why and on the basis of  what  evidence  she
        found the sponsor to be a sole trader, (b) there was confusion over
        the level of income threshold actually applicable in this case. The
        Judge found the children  had  been  incorrectly  included  in  the
        application but failed to give adequate reasons for her findings on
        this matter, (c) the Judge failed  to  give  adequate  reasons  for
        finding the sponsor had sufficient income to meet the threshold for
        one non-national dependent. It is unclear whether before the  Judge
        there was evidence of self-employment required under paragraph 8 of
        Appendix FM-SE, (d) the Judge's assessment under Article 8 fails to
        undertake a full and proper assessment or to give adequate reasons.



Error of law


     6. The Judge erred in law but the question is whether  such  error  is
        material to the  decision  to  allow  the  appeal.  There  is,  for
        example, in paragraph 7 a reference to the burden standard of proof
        being "on the balance of probabilities" yet in paragraph 17 to  the
        Judge being satisfied to the "lower-level of proof required  of  an
        Appellant".  In an appeal of this nature the  correct  standard  is
        the civil standard, the balance of probabilities.   Notwithstanding
        what may appear to be a contradictory statement regarding the lower-
        level of proof I  do  not  find  a  reading  of  the  determination
        demonstrates anything other than the correct burden  being  applied
        in arriving at the decisions under challenge.


     7. The original application included Mrs Hammond  and  three  children
        all of whom were declared to be citizens of the  United  States  of
        America. The applications of all were refused as the  ECO  was  not
        satisfied that it had been proved  the  required  income  level  of
        �27,200 per annum had been shown to be available.


     8. The appeal is in the name of Maria Hammond only and  oral  evidence
        was given by Mr Hammond to the Judge that two of the children  will
        remain in the United States of America and will be the  subject  of
        separate applications in the future.  Although the Judge  fails  to
        identify in the determination the minimum level of income  required
        to be demonstrated it was accepted before the Upper  Tribunal  that
        this is the sum of �18,600 for Mrs Hammond only.


     9. A substantial  volume  of  material  was  provided  by  Mr  Hammond
        relating to his work and income. It is clear that  the  application
        form contained incorrect information in  describing  him  as  being
        involved in a limited company and/or to his being employed, as  the
        evidence  clearly  stipulates  that  the   contracts   Mr   Hammond
        undertakes are in  his  capacity  as  a  self-employed  independent
        contractor with no employer/ employee  relationship  being  proved.
        The evidence clearly shows that Mr Hammond is self  employed.  This
        is not disputed before the Upper Tribunal.


    10. Notwithstanding the substantial income figures contained within the
        information made available to the Tribunal, Appendix FM-SE sets out
        the specified evidence that must be provided to prove that adequate
        funds are genuinely available.  Paragraph 7 of FM-SE states that in
        respect of self-employment in the  UK  as  a  partner,  as  a  sole
        trader, or in a franchise "all the following must be provided"  and
        specifies  a  number  of  documents  including  HMRC  annual  self-
        assessment tax returns, personal bank statements, and  evidence  of
        ongoing self-employment, required to enable an individual to  prove
        not only that they are  self-employed  but  also  that  the  income
        derived from that employment is sufficient to meet the requirements
        of the Rules.  Mr Hammond is self-employed but outside  the  United
        Kingdom and therefore paragraph 8 is the relevant  paragraph  which
        states:


              "8. In respect of self-employment  outside  the  UK,  evidence
   should be a                  reasonable equivalent to  that  set  out  in
   paragraph 7".


    11. Mr Mills, in his submissions, accepted that  as  a  result  of  the
        nature of income earned outside the United Kingdom, over which  the
        Secretary of State has no control,  paragraph  8  permits  a  broad
        discretion in relation to the nature of the evidence  that  can  be
        taken into account by a decision maker.


    12. Mr Hammond gave oral evidence to the Judge and was found  to  be  a
        credible witness in relation to the situation appertaining  at  the
        date of decision and the evidence provided which  shows  an  income
        considerably in excess of �18,600. The only issue relating to  that
        income  is  whether  there  was  a  reasonable  equivalent  to  the
        documents set out in paragraph 7  to  establish  that  the  claimed
        income is in fact available.  Where the Judge stated  in  paragraph
        19 that the sponsor has established by "probative evidence that the
        facts are as  stated"  this  appears  to  be  acceptance  that  the
        evidence of contracts of engagement, bank statements, and schedules
        of income earned, satisfies this requirement.


    13. Having reviewed all the material, and although the  Judge  did  not
        approach  her  findings  by  specific  reference  to  the  relevant
        provisions of the Rules, I am satisfied that no material  error  is
        made in her allowing the appeal under the Immigration Rules  as  Mr
        Hammond has, by providing documents reasonably equivalent to  those
        in paragraph 7, shown that more than adequate income is available.


    14. As the income issue was the  only  matter  outstanding  before  the
        Judge a finding that the appeal should be allowed under  the  Rules
        is therefore a finding with the range of  those  available  to  the
        Judge on the evidence. In relation to the  Judge's  decision  under
        Article 8; there is  no  reference  to  relevant  case  law  or  an
        analysis of the Secretary of State's position which is a  mandatory
        requirement  as  the  Judge   was   purporting   to   undertake   a
        proportionality assessment, but in light of the  fact  Mrs  Hammond
        succeeds under the Immigration Rules there is not need to deal with
        Article 8 further although, as this is an error of law hearing, the
        finding will have to be that an any error is in  form  rather  than
        substance and not material to the decision.


Decision

    15. There is no material  error  of  law  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal
        Judge's decision. The determination shall stand.




   Anonymity.


    16. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005. I make no such order pursuant to  rule  14  of  the  Tribunal
        Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
