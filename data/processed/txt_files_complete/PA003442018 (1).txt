                       DECISION OF THE UPPER TRIBUNAL
                        PURSUANT TO RULE 40(3)(a) OF
             THE TRIBUNAL PROCEDURE (UPPER TRIBUNAL) RULES 2008


 1. The appellant, an Egyptian citizen, appeals with  permission  from  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal dismissing his appeal  against  the
    respondent's decision to refuse his claim for international  protection
    on asylum or humanitarian protection grounds, or leave to remain in the
    United Kingdom on human rights grounds based on his asserted  links  to
    the Muslim Brotherhood.

 2. Permission to appeal was granted based on inadequacy of  reasoning,  in
    particular with regard to the witness HA, who gave evidence.

 3. At the hearing today, it was common ground that the First-tier Tribunal
    did materially err in law in that the decision lacked factual  findings
    about the evidence of the witness HA  and  was  generally  inadequately
    reasoned.  The parties agree that this is a case where the decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal must be set aside, and that no written  reasons
    are required.  The requirements of sub-paragraphs 40(3)(a) and 40(3)(b)
    of the Rules are met.  I am satisfied that the decision of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal can properly be set aside  without  a  reasoned  decision
    notice.

 4. By consent, no written reasons are required.

 5. I therefore set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

 6. Pursuant to Rule 14 of The Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 (as amended), the anonymity order made by the First-tier  Tribunal
    is maintained.

 7. The appeal will now proceed  to  the  stage  in  which  the  First-tier
    Tribunal will remake the  decision  to  allow  or  dismiss  the  appeal
    afresh, with no findings of fact or credibility preserved.
