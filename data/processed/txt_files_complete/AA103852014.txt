                      ERROR OF LAW DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant ZN, date of birth 3.10.95, is a citizen of Afghanistan.

 2. This is his appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge North promulgated 24.4.15,  dismissing  his  appeal  against  the
    decision of the Secretary of  State,  dated  17.11.14,  to  refuse  his
    asylum, humanitarian protection, and human rights  claims.   The  Judge
    heard the appeal on 10.4.15.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Shimmin  refused  permission  to  appeal  on
    18.5.15. However,  when  the  application  was  renewed  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Chamberlain granted permission to
    appeal on 23.7.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 3.11.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. For the reasons set out below I find that there was such error  of  law
    in the making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  that  the
    decision of Judge North  should  be  set  aside  in  its  entirety  and
    remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be heard de novo.

 6.  The  primary  ground  of  appeal  is  that  Judge  North  mistook  the
    appellant's age, stating at �6 that the appellant stated he was born in
    October 1986. That is not correct. The appellant's age has  been  given
    as 3.10.95, which is stated at the top of the refusal decision, on  the
    file jacket, and confirmed in an age assessment by Staffordshire Social
    Services. He was therefore 16 years of age when  entering  the  UK  and
    claiming asylum. In consequence, the refusal decision of 2.6.11 granted
    discretionary leave to remain as an unaccompanied child. In March  2013
    the appellant applied for further leave to remain, when aged 18 and had
    turned 19 by the date of the refusal.

 7. Judge North did not take any account  of  the  appellant's  youth  when
    considering the credibility of his account as to events in  Afghanistan
    including allegedly assisting his father in the delivery of  goods  for
    the government during a period  when  the  appellant  would  have  been
    between approximately 13 and 16 years of age. At �8  of  the  decision,
    Judge North found that the appellant's inability to provide descriptive
    detail  undermined  his  credibility.  The   judge   also   relied   on
    inconsistencies in the account.

 8. Whilst he did not concede the issue, Mr McVeety was unable to offer any
    effective resistance to this primary ground of appeal. He accepted that
    the judge made no relevant reference to the appellant's age, other than
    getting the appellant's age completely wrong at �6 of the decision.

 9. I find that the judge should have  taken  account  of  the  appellant's
    youth and made  due  allowance  for  that  factor  when  assessing  the
    appellant's credibility. The failure to do so entirely  undermines  the
    findings and the  conclusions  to  be  drawn  therefrom,  so  that  the
    reasoning of the judge amounts to material error of law, which  infects
    the entirety of the decision.

10. The other grounds  of  appeal,  including  health  issues,  the  expert
    report, and whether the appellant would be able to resume contact  with
    family members in Afghanistan, are far less persuasive. However,  given
    the fundamental error of law disclosed by the first ground  of  appeal,
    it is not necessary to reach a conclusion on those  others  issues,  as
    the decision must be set aside to be remade afresh.

11. When a decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside,  section
    12(2) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 requires either
    that the case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  with  directions,
    or it must be remade by the Upper Tribunal. The scheme of the Tribunals
    Court and Enforcement Act 2007 does not assign the function of  primary
    fact finding to the  Upper  Tribunal.  The  errors  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge vitiates all other findings of fact and the  conclusions
    from those facts so that there has not been a  valid  determination  of
    the issues in the appeal.

12. In all the circumstances, at the invitation and request of both parties
    to relist this appeal for a fresh hearing in the First-tier Tribunal, I
    do so, on the basis that this is a case which falls squarely within the
    Senior President's Practice Statement at paragraph 7.2. The  effect  of
    the error has been to deprive the appellant of a fair hearing and  that
    the nature or extent of any judicial fact finding  which  is  necessary
    for the decision in the appeal to  be  re-made  is  such  that,  having
    regard to the overriding objective in rule 2 to deal with cases  fairly
    and justly, including with the avoidance of delay, I find  that  it  is
    appropriate  to  remit  this  appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    determine the appeal afresh.

Conclusions:

13. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making  of  an  error  on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

                    I remit the decision in the appeal to be made afresh  in
                    the First-tier Tribunal.

Consequential Directions

14. The appeal is to be reheard afresh, with no findings preserved, in  the
    First-tier Tribunal at Stoke-on-Trent;

15. The time  estimate  is  3  hours,  with  two  witnesses  including  the
    appellant;

16. The appeal may be listed before any  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  other
    than Judge North and Judge Shimmin.

17. A Pushto interpreter will be required.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order. However,  given  the  circumstances  of  the
appellant's age, I make an anonymity order.

Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable in this case and thus there can be no fee award.
