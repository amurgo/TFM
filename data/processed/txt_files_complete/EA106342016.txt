For the appellant:  Mathias Ume-Ezeoke  (counsel instructed by Kaim Todner)
For the respondent: Mr Tom Wilding


                            DECISION AND REASONS

       This is an appeal, by the , against the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Norris[1]), sitting at Hatton Cross on 19  January,  to
    an EEA  appeal by a citizen of Nigeria, born 1967. After coming here on
    a student visa in 2007, the appellant had first been given a  residence
    card as the  dependent  extended  family  member  of  his  cousin  (the
    sponsor) on 27 September 2010. He had however been refused a  permanent
    residence card, first in 2016, and then, following a fresh  application
    on 7 February 2017, in the decision under appeal on 9 July 2017.

 2. The respondent had not been satisfied that the appellant had been  "...
    residing with/dependent on your EEA  sponsor  for  5  continuous  years
    ...". The judge had taken this case at short notice, and  got  no  help
    from the appellant, and no significant help from the presenting officer
    (see his paragraphs 5.1 - 5.3).

 3. Like the writer of the decision letter, the judge took the relevant EEA
    Regulations as those of 2016. Despite a suggestion to the  contrary  by
    Mr Wilding, it seems to me  he  was  right  about  that:  this  is  the
    transitional provision made in schedule 5  'Transitory  Provisions'  of
    the 2016 Regulations:

       2.  Between the coming  into  force  of  the  provisions  covered  by
       regulation 1(2)(a)  and  the  coming  into  force  of  the  remaining
       provisions covered by regulation 1(2)(b)  an  application  under  the
       2006 Regulations for-
       ...
       (e)    a permanent residence card;
       ...
       made but not determined before 25th November 2016 is to be treated as
       having been made under the 2006 Regulations, as amended by  paragraph
       1 of this Schedule.

 4. These are the commencement provisions in reg. 1 (2):

       (2) These Regulations come into force-

       (a)    for the  purposes  of  this  regulation,  regulation  44  and
       Schedule 5 (transitory provisions), on 25th November 2016;

       (b)    for all other purposes, on 1st February 2017.

 5. The result is that the application in this case would have  had  to  be
    dealt with under the 2006 Regulations, if decided between those  dates;
    but not if after the second, as it was. Whether anything will  turn  on
    this  remains  to  be  seen.  The  operative  provisions  of  the  2016
    Regulations for this case are in reg. 8:

       8.     (1) In these Regulations  "extended  family  member"  means  a
       person who is not a family member of an EEA national under regulation
       7(1)(a), (b) or (c) and who satisfies a condition in  paragraph  (2),
       (3), (4) or (5).

       (2)    The condition in this paragraph is that the person is-

             (a)    a relative of an EEA national; and

             (b)    ...

             (ii)   has joined the EEA national in the United  Kingdom  and
             continues to be dependent upon the EEA national, or  to  be  a
             member of the EEA national's household.

 6. This of course allowed the appellant to  show  either  that  he  was  a
    member of the sponsor's household at the date of the decision; or  that
    he was dependent on him then. It is common ground  on  the  authorities
    that dependency need not be one of necessity;  but  must  at  least  be
    significant.

 7. The judge made the findings of fact on dependency:

     a) between 2009 and October 2017 the appellant  was  living  with  the
        sponsor "according to various bills and letters  addressed  to  him
        there during those years. Therefore I  find  that  they  have  been
        living in the same  household,  which  is  a  factor  in  assessing
        dependency".

     b) The appellant was receiving small sums of money annually  from  the
        sponsor.

     c) The sponsor had met larger expenses, of which no evidence remained,
        such as  flight  tickets  and  computer  repairs.  There  was  also
        evidence of a transfer of �1,500 from the sponsor to the  appellant
        in November 2017.

     d)  The  judge  could  not  accept  that  the  sponsor  had  paid  the
        appellant's tuition fees (over �17,000) in all,  for  lack  of  any
        bank statements in which the payments appeared.

     e)  "...  however  overall  these  documents   demonstrate   financial
        dependency by the Appellant on his sponsor. I am extremely confused
        by the fact that the Appellant says he has put large sums of money,
        received on behalf of his church, through his own tax return, but I
        do not consider  that  this  alters  the  essential  point  of  his
        financial dependency on his cousin/sponsor".

     f) The judge did  not  accept  that  the  sponsor  was  providing  the
        appellant with necessary emotional support in a  course  of  cancer
        treatment he was taking.

     g) "Nonetheless, overall and on the balance of probabilities,  I  find
        that the Appellant is dependent on his sponsor. The factors are not
        prescriptive and those set out in  the  guidance  are  illustrative
        only. Therefore, given their cohabitation in  the  same  household,
        the limited expenses of the Appellant other than his student  fees,
        his unchallenged prior dependency and the payments for  his  living
        costs, I am satisfied that he is indeed dependent ..."

 8. The judge had made  some  entirely  realistic  findings  on  individual
    points, against the appellant on the most significant one in  financial
    terms (d). He had found himself unable to make  any  finding  on  other
    significant sums coming into the appellant's bank  account  (e),  which
    left the appellant unable to establish that they were not funds of  his
    own. It is quite clear from the terms of his findings at  (a)  and  (g)
    that he would not have accepted that the  appellant  was  significantly
    dependent on the sponsor, if they had  not  been  living  in  the  same
    household from 2009 till October 2017.

 9. If the appellant and the sponsor had been living in the same  household
    for the necessary five-year period, then the judge at least might  have
    been justified in concluding that  the  required  dependency  had  been
    established. This state of affairs had however certainly come to an end
    by the time the sponsor wrote his letter of 1 December 2015, saying the
    appellant had already decided to move out and was living  on  his  own:
    the judge does not seem to have noticed this.

10. The question then is whether  there  was  evidence  to  show  that  the
    appellant had been dependent on the sponsor in this way for a period of
    five years before that point. Mr Wilding argued  that  no  such  period
    could begin till the appellant's status as an  extended  family  member
    had been recognized by the issue of his  first  residence  card  on  27
    September  2010.  While  he  based  his  argument  on  the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006, for reasons already given  I
    regard the 2016 ones as applying to this case.

11. The relevant regulation giving a right of permanent residence is this:

       15     (1) The following persons acquire the right to reside  in  the
       United Kingdom permanently-
       ...
       (b)    a family member of an EEA national who is not an EEA  national
       but who has resided in the United Kingdom with the  EEA  national  in
       accordance with these Regulations for a  continuous  period  of  five
       years;

12. The next point is the definition of 'family member', which for  present
    purposes is to be found at reg. 7 (3):

       A person ("B") who is an extended family member and has  been  issued
       with an EEA family permit, a registration certificate or a  residence
       card must be treated as a family member of A, provided-

        (a)  B continues to satisfy the conditions in regulation 8(2), (3),
           (4) or (5); and

        (b)  the EEA family permit, registration certificate  or  residence
           card remains in force.

13. It follows from this that the appellant did not fall to be treated as a
    family member of the sponsor's till he was first issued with a card  on
    27 September 2010. The next question is the date till  when  the  judge
    might have been justified in accepting that he  remained  dependent  on
    the sponsor, on the basis that they were living in the same household.

14. Here it is necessary to look at the evidence before the judge in rather
    more detail than he did. The judge made his finding (see 7  (a)  above)
    in very  general  terms,  referring  to  "various  bills  and  letters"
    addressed to him at the sponsor's house, without going  into  any  more
    explanation: as already  mentioned,  he  got  no  real  help  from  the
    presenting officer.

15.  The  academic  letters  enclosed  with  the  covering  letter  to  the
    application (annexe E in the respondent's bundle)  clearly  showed  the
    sponsor living at Flat 13 [ - ], SE15 throughout the period in question
    (from 5 March 2010 on: see E2). However the appellant's bank statements
    (annexe I) have him at a quite different address (48  [  -  ],  Bexley)
    from when they begin on 22 August 2015.

16. It is hard to think of any explanation for this, other  than  that  the
    appellant had already moved out of the sponsor's flat;  even  if  there
    had been one, he did not take the opportunity of appearing  before  the
    judge and giving it, subject to cross-examination. He had said  he  was
    undergoing cancer treatment, and asked for the case to be dealt with on
    the papers; but he could have  applied  for  an  adjournment,  and  the
    consequences of not doing so are his own responsibility,  and  that  of
    the solicitors representing him at the time.


17. The result is that there was no evidence which might have justified the
    judge in making a finding of dependency beyond 22 August 2015, and  the
    appellant failed to show the necessary five years'  dependency  on  the
    sponsor from 27 September 2010. The judge disregarded material evidence
    to that effect, and his decision is reversed.
