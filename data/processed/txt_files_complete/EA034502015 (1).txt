                            DECISION AND REASONS






BACKGROUND TO THE APPEAL

1.   The Appellant was born on 31 July 1986, is a national of Sri Lanka.  On
    7 February 2017 First-tier Tribunal Judge Herbert dismissed his  appeal
    against the decision by the Respondent to refuse him a  residence  card
    as an extended family member of an EEA  national  exercising  a  Treaty
    right in the United Kingdom.

2.   He appealed and Upper Tribunal Judge Bruce granted  him  permission  to
    appeal on 1 March 2018. She also  stated  that  she  assumed  that  the
    appeal would not be opposed by the Respondent and stated that,  if  the
    Respondent did wish to oppose the appeal, she must do so in writing  no
    later than 22 March 2018. She added that if the Respondent did  not  do
    so the Upper Tribunal would dispose of the matter by finding  an  error
    of law and remitting the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.
ERROR OF LAW DECISION

3.   I allow the Appellant's appeal on the basis that Sala (EFMs:  Right  of
    Appeal) [2006] UKUT 00411 (IAC) was  wrongly  decided  and,  therefore,
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Herbert erred in law when he  found  that  he
    had no jurisdiction to hear the appeal.

4.   As the substance of this appeal has not  yet  been  considered  by  the
    First-tier Tribunal, I find that the appeal should be remitted to  that
    Tribunal.

DECISION

(1)  The  Appellant's  appeal  is  allowed  and  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Herbert's decision is set aside.

(2)  The appeal is remitted to a First-tier Tribunal Judge other than First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Herbert for a de novo hearing.
