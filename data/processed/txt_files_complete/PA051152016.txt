               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     Mr S Martin, of Jain, Neil & Ruddy, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals against a determination  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge David C Clapham SSC, promulgated on 10 January 2017.

 2. I find that the grounds of appeal  to  the  UT,  supplemented  in  oral
    submissions, do not establish that the making of the  decision  of  the
    FtT involved the making of any error on a point of law.

 3. Ground 1 says that the judge gave  inadequate  reasons  at  �35-37  for
    rejecting the appellant's evidence that his girlfriend,  Lewan,  became
    tired and changed in appearance after loss of  her  virginity  (thereby
    alerting the girlfriend's family to the nature of their  relationship),
    and it should have been within judicial knowledge that pregnancy  would
    bring about such changes.

 4. Mr Martin said there had been  no  evidence  of  a  pregnancy  but  the
    evidence should have suggested to the judge  that  such  might  be  the
    case.

 5. Mr Matthews pointed out that according to  the  appellant  he  had  one
    sexual encounter with his girlfriend, on 24 or 26 October 2016; threats
    against him from her family began on 10 October; he was last threatened
    on either 15 or 28 October; and he fled Iraq by 30 October.

 6. If the judge should have  taken  any  account  of  the  possibility  of
    pregnancy and its becoming evident, there was at most one week for  the
    change of characteristics to emerge.

 7. Once reference is made to the evidence, the  ground  loses  any  force.
    The judge needed to say no more than he did about rejecting this aspect
    of the evidence.

 8. Ground 2 says that the judge erred at �37 by giving inadequate  reasons
    for rejecting the appellant's evidence  about  the  first  threat  made
    against him, namely that he did not recognise it as such.

 9. Mr Matthews demonstrated by reference to the evidence recorded  at  �18
    of the decision and at Q/A 105 of the asylum interview that  there  was
    an inconsistency; that it was put to the appellant; and that  he  tried
    to row back from parts of his evidence.

10. The judge was entitled to resolve this matter as he did.

11. Ground 3 says that at �37 the judge applied  too  high  a  standard  of
    proof when declining to accept that Lewan's father is a  powerful  man,
    and that having a bodyguard showed he had significant  position  within
    the KDP.

12. The judge resolved this factual matter also for sensible reasons.  This
    ground is only disagreement dressed up as error under a legal  heading,
    when there is nothing in the decision to bear out any misconception  of
    the standard of proof.

13. Ground 4 says that the  judge  speculated  by  taking  it  against  the
    appellant that he prioritised his own safety over his girlfriend.

14. This ground misrepresents the judge's main point here,  which  was  not
    that the appellant would not have abandoned his  girlfriend,  but  that
    absence of interest in her subsequent welfare belied his claims.   That
    is far from speculative.

15. Ground 5 insists that so strong is the power of Lewan's father that the
    claim could not be defeated by sufficiency of protection or by internal
    relocation.

16. In absence of any favourable credibility  findings,  these  issues  are
    incidental.

17. The claim, on any  sensible  view,  fell  far  short  of  showing  risk
    throughout Iraq.

18. Separately and together, the grounds are no more  than  insistence  and
    disagreement on the facts.

19. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

20. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
