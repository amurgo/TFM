|DETERMINATION AND REASONS                                                 |

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr.  F.  Gaskin,  of  Counsel,  instructed  by   Reid
                       Sinclair & Co. Solicitors.
For the Respondent:    Ms. C. Hanrahan, Home Office Presenting Officer.

1.    The Appellant is a citizen of the Democratic  Republic  of  the  Congo
     (formerly Zaire) (DRC), born on 24th April 1974. She has appealed, with
     leave, against the determination of Mr. F R C Such, an Adjudicator, who
     (following a hearing on 16th January 2003 at  Taylor  House)  dismissed
     her appeal under Section 69(1) and under Section 65 of the  Immigration
     and Asylum Appeals Act 1999 (the 1999  Act)  against  the  Respondent's
     decision of 13th August 2002  to  refuse  leave  to  enter  the  United
     Kingdom. The Respondent proposes to remove the Appellant to the DRC.

2.    The Appellant left the DRC on 1st April 2002 and travelled to  France,
     where she stayed for 2 � months. She left France on 15th June 2002  and
     travelled to the United  Kingdom  by  Eurostar,  arriving  at  Waterloo
     Station on the same date. On arrival, she made  her  asylum  and  human
     rights claims. Her husband, who had arrived in 1995, had exhausted  his
     appeal rights (according to � 1. of the  Adjudicator's  Determination).
     Apparently, as at the date of the hearing before  the  Adjudicator,  he
     was in custody pending removal to the DRC.

3.    Basis of claim (in brief):  In Kinshasa, the Appellant  was  the  best
     friend of Micheline Mushiya, who was the mistress of Eddy  Kapend,  who
     was high in President Laurent Kabila's government.  The  Appellant  and
     Micheline carried out a business together,  exporting  to  Brazzaville.
     Four days after the assassination of Laurent Kabila (on  17th  February
     2001), soldiers arrested the Appellant, Micheline,  Micheline's  friend
     and two female students. By this time, Mr.  Kapend had been arrested on
     suspicion of being involved in the  assassination.  The  Appellant  was
     accused of being an accomplice to Mr. Kapend. She was detained for 1  �
     months. Wives of various commanders  were  also  incarcerated  in  this
     detention centre. A body of comanders raided the detention  centre  and
     set their wives plus the Appellant and Micheline  free.  The  Appellant
     sought refuge in the house of a friend named Fatou. She stayed with her
     friend  for  11  months.  When  the  trial  of  those  accused  of  the
     assassination began in March  2002,  the  authorities  began  arresting
     innocent people and family members of the accused.  Fatou  advised  the
     Appellant to leave the  DRC.  The  Appellant  then  left  the  DRC,  in
     disguise, with an agent. She flew to Luanda in Angola and then Paris.

4.    The Adjudicator's Determination: The Adjudicator considered  that  the
     Appellant had not been consistent about where she had been arrested. In
     her self-completed questionnaire (SCQ), she had said that she had  been
     arrested at Micheline's house,  whereas,  at  her  interview,  she  had
     stated that she was arrested in Mrs. Kapend's house. He noted that  she
     had purported not to know the name of Mrs.  Kapend,  although  she  had
     said that she had met her and had received packages from her to take to
     Brazzaville. She had not been consistent about the goods which she  had
     allegedly traded. No objective evidence had been placed before  him  of
     any commando raid of a detention centre as claimed  by  the  Appellant.
     Her delay in leaving the DRC indicated that she was of no  interest  to
     the authorities. He did not accept that she was close  to  either  Mrs.
     Kapend or Micheline, nor that she was involved with either of them.  He
     did not accept that she was arrested  following  Mr.  Kapend's  arrest.
     Before  the  Adjudicator,  reliance  was  placed  on   the   Tribunal's
     Determination in Mozu [2002] UKIAT 05308.

5.    In the grounds of application for leave to  appeal  the  Tribunal,  it
     was asserted (inter alia) that the  Adjudicator  erred  in  considering
     that Mozu had no application to this case, given that Mozu  deals  with
     returnability of failed asylum seekers to the  DRC  regardless  of  the
     reasons for the failure of their claims.

6.    Leave to appeal to the Tribunal was granted in  a  determination  sent
     to the parties on 20th March 2003. The reason for  granting  leave  was
     that, although Mozu was a decision on the facts and not binding on  the
     Adjudicator, it was desirable that the Tribunal should speak  with  one
     voice, even on questions of fact,  where  those  turn  on  the  general
     background in a particular country. The Tribunal should  revisit  Mozu,
     if that case was being used for  a  purpose  for  which  it  was  never
     intended. Leave was granted only on this point and specifically refused
     otherwise.

7.    At the hearing before us, Mr. Gaskin sought to take up  ground  2.  of
     the grounds of application, on which leave had been refused.  We  heard
     briefly on this, and then decided to grant leave in relation to  ground
     2, which challenges the Adjudicator's credibility findings.

      The issues:

8.    There are two issues before us:

      Issue  1:    Whether  (regardless  of  any  credibility  issues),  the
             Appellant  would  be  at  real  risk  of  persecution   and/or
             treatment in breach of Article 3 as a  failed  asylum  seeker,
             per se (i.e. the Senga point). If the answer is yes, then  the
             appeal stood to be allowed. If the answer is no, then we would
             proceed to consider the next issue, which is:

      Issue 2:   Whether the Adjudicator's findings are safe.
      Issue 1 - Risk as a failed asylum seeker:

9.1   Mr. Gaskin relied on the Tribunal's Determination in Mozu and also  on
     the report of Mr. Kennes (this, it would seem, is  his  correct  title,
     rather than Dr. Kennes) dated 30th  July  2002,  a  copy  of  which  he
     submitted. He could  not  say  whether  this  report  (which  had  been
     prepared for a specific case) was authorised by the author for  release
     generally. This report was  referred  to  in  �  9  of  the  Tribunal's
     Determination in  Mozu.  Mr.  Gaskin  submitted  that  Mr.  Kennes  has
     considerable expertise.

9.2   We were referred to Section C on page 28 of this report,  which  deals
     with the fate of returned asylum seekers to the DRC. It is  appropriate
     that we set out Section C of the report in full:

            C.   The fate of returned asylum seekers in the DRC

            No systematic studies have been done on  the  fate  of  returned
           asylum seekers, nor on the Kinshasa government policy.  We  must
           relay on two letters and two press articles.

            The first press article is a statement of a former  official  of
           the Minister of  the  Interior,  inspector  of  the  immigration
           police. According  to  his  statement,  returned  failed  asylum
           seekers are immediately arrested at the airport and subsequently
           imprisoned. No other source of information is known  about  this
           alleged practice, and it has not been independently verified.

            The second press article is about an official statement  by  the
           immigration  office.  On  May  24,  2001,  the  newly  appointed
           director general of  the  Congolese  immigration  services,  Mr.
           Leyka  Moussa  Nyembo,  delivered  a  speech  in  Hotel  Memling
           (Kinshasa) where he outlined his immigration policy. Mention was
           made of the attitude of his services ad the  government  towards
           returned political asylum seekers. Mr. Leyka declared he  wanted
           to dismantle underground emigration networks, who operate  under
           the cover  of  applications  for  political  asylum  in  western
           countries. One of the instruments of his  policy  would  be  the
           creation of "migratory detention centres" in  Kinshasa.  In  the
           press reports about this speech, it was not clear what the  role
           would be of these centres.

            During a telephone conversation with the author of  his  report,
           Mr. Leyka made it clear that the "migratory  detention  centres"
           are not centres of imprisonment. The aim of the centres  is  the
           screening and identification of returned  asylum  seekers,  with
           the view of heir  reintegration  into  society.  Information  is
           gathered about the individuals behind the underground  networks,
           to be  able  to  put  them  before  justice.  According  to  the
           assistant to the director general, some  of  these  centres  are
           already operational.

            According to this official  version,  the  "migratory  detention
           centres" are just a screening agency. There is no  problem  with
           it as long  as  the  returned  asylum  seekers  are  effectively
           members of an underground migration network.  When  the  centres
           harbour returned asylum seekers who were entitled  to  political
           asylum  but  were  unjustly  refused,   then   the   authorities
           immediately have their opponents at hand to interrogate them and
           put them into jail. The real function of the  detention  centres
           is  thus  linked  to  the  overall  government  policy   towards
           opposition. The government policy towards  political  opposition
           cannot be considered without taking into account the workings of
           the judicial system, and more specifically, the workings of  the
           Military Court.

            The first letter is made up by the Amnesty International  London
           office and states that Amnesty had received  reports  in  August
           2000  about  three  returned  asylum  seekers  who   have   been
           imprisoned in Makala prison, Kinshasa.

            The second letter is the most  crucial  document.  In  a  letter
           written by Mr. Wanigasekara (UNHCR London) to Mr. Zohreh  Neinzi
           of the Devon law Centre, dated November 20, 2001, it is said

                 It is important  to  consider  that  the  overall  security
                 situation remains volatile  and  is  a  matter  of  general
                 concern to everyone resident in the  DRC.  Despite  ongoing
                 efforts and negotiations between  the  opposition  parties,
                 armed  movements  and  the   government,   fighting   still
                 continues between the rebel and the  government  forces  in
                 the  eastern  and  southeastern  regions  as  well  as  the
                 Equateur province, resulting in human rights violations.

                 Against this backdrop, persons originating from  rebel-held
                 territories (....) are held  in  suspicion  and  liable  to
                 adverse attention - sometimes amounting  to  persecution  -
                 from the authorities in Kinshasa (...)

                 According to information available to UNHCR, agents of  the
                 security   services   frequently   interrogate    Congolese
                 returning to Kinshasa from abroad, particularly  those  who
                 are  known  to  have  sought  asylum.  UNHCR  is  aware  of
                 instances where  interrogation  at  the  airport  has  been
                 followed by arbitrary detention and serious  ill  treatment
                 by DRC security agencies. If the returnee  is  not  already
                 known to the DRC authorities, there is a strong  likelihood
                 that were he to be returned  to  Kinshasa,  his  background
                 would be revealed  in  the  course  of  interrogation  upon
                 arrival.

            We may add to this element that  returned  asylum  seekers  from
           the UK will be met with more suspicion than others,  because  of
           the support given by the British government  to  the  RCD  rebel
           movement in the East, and more specifically to  the  governments
           of Rwanda and Uganda.

9.3   We were also referred to the report of the Special Rapporteur  of  the
     United Nations Economic  and  Social  Council  -  Commission  on  Human
     Rights, dated 1st February 2001, extracts of which are set out on pages
     22 to 23 of  Mr.  Kennes'  report.   The  Special  Rapporteur's  report
     mentions, inter  alia,  gross  human  rights  violations  in  the  DRC,
     arbitrary detention, prolonged detention without due  process,  torture
     in prisons, the "very bad conditions" of detention  in  Makala  prison,
     many deaths in prisons (in particular, Makala prison).  In � 82 of  the
     report  (quoted  at  page  22  of  Mr.  Kennes'  report),  the  Special
     Rapporteur mentions that ten UDPS  (Union  Pour  La  Democratie  et  le
     Progres Social) leaders who were held at Kinshasa  police  inspectorate
     until the day he arrived in the country had not registered.  They  were
     then taken to an unknown destination.

9.4   We were also referred to � � 4.18 to 4.22 of the CIPU Report of  April
     2003. This states that conditions in most of the large, central prisons
     are harsh but are no longer  life-threatening  as  they  have  been  in
     previous years (�  4.18).  However,  conditions  in  the  small,  local
     prisons remain harsh and life-threatening (� 4.20). According to �4.19,
     146 persons died at Makala prison in 2002. Makala prison is  Kinshasa's
     main central prison (� 4.18).  There  are  numerous  illegal  detention
     centres which are operated by the security services, especially the ANR
     (Agencie  Nationale  de  Renseignements)  and  the   DEMIAP   (Military
     Detection of Anti-Patriotic Activities. Annex  C  of  the  CIPU  Report
     states that the ANR shares responsibility  for  internal  and  external
     security with the CNS,  including  border  security  matters.  Annex  C
     states that the CNS (National Security Council)  shared  responsibility
     for internal and external  security  with  the  ANR,  including  border
     security matters and that it was replaced by the  Committee  for  State
     Security in 2002.

9.5   Mr. Gaskin submitted that there was a real risk that returning  failed
     asylum seekers are transferred to prisons or illegal detentions centres
     until such time as enquiries are completed.  The  fact  that  the  CIPU
     Report states that illegal detention centres are operated  by  the  ANR
     (which, with the CNS until it was replaced, was responsible for  border
     security matters) meant that there  was  a  real  risk  that  returning
     failed asylum  seekers  would  be  transferred  to  illegal  detentions
     centres. Even if they are held  at  migratory  detention  centres,  Mr.
     Gaskin submitted that it cannot  be  assumed  that  conditions  in  the
     migratory detention centres are  any  better  than  the  conditions  in
     prisons or illegal detention centres.

      Determination of Issue 1:

10.1  We would say at the outset that we are considering  the  situation  of
     failed asylum seekers returning to  the  DRC  whose  claims  have  been
     properly assessed and whose backgrounds have been found to be such that
     there is no real risk that they would draw the adverse attention of the
     DRC authorities. We entirely accept that  anyone  whose  background  is
     such that there  is  a  real  risk  that  they  would,  on  arrival  or
     subsequently, draw the adverse attention of the DRC authorities,  would
     be very harshly treated indeed. They, however, would succeed  in  their
     asylum and human rights claims (Article 3).

10.2  We have no reason to doubt the expertise of Mr. Kennes to  comment  on
     the situation in the DRC. His curriculum vitae (which is annexed to his
     report)  shows  that  he  has  undertaken  studies  (including  ongoing
     research papers on Zaire), been involved in training  courses,  written
     or co-written several publications and working papers on  Africa  (with
     emphasis on the DRC).

10.3  We noted that Mr. Kennes' report has  been  prepared  for  a  specific
     case. Our attention has not been drawn to anything which suggests  that
     the report is authorised for use generally and/or that its contents are
     of general application. The Tribunal has, on countless occasion in  the
     past, made it clear that reports should not been adduced if  they  have
     been prepared for a specific case unless the  author's  permission  has
     been obtained and the author has confirmed that  the  contents  are  of
     general application. This simply has not been done in this case.

10.4  Nevertheless, we considered the report. We noted that the first  press
     article  is attributed, according to footnote 72  on  page  28  of  the
     report, to a release dated 13th October 2000 -  which  is  nearly  2  �
     years ago. Furthermore, Mr. Kennes himself states, in relation  to  the
     first press article, that no other source of information is known about
     the alleged practice of immediately arresting  returned  failed  asylum
     seekers at the airport and  imprisoning  them,  and  that  the  alleged
     practice has not been independently verified.

10.5  Against the first press article, we  have  to  set  the  second  press
     article, which (having been issued in May 2001) is more recent than the
     first press article and which was an official statement issued  by  the
     immigration service. We acknowledge that official statements  from  the
     DRC authorities  suggesting  that  returned  asylum  seekers  would  be
     properly treated should, bearing  in  mind  the  general  human  rights
     record of the DRC government, be viewed with great suspicion. We  noted
     that the first press article states that persons  whose  asylum  claims
     have been "unjustly refused" would be interrogated and  imprisoned.  If
     this was said by the official in question to Mr. Kennes,  then  such  a
     candid admission on the part of the official endows  the  remainder  of
     what he is quoted to have said  above  with  greater  credibility  than
     might have been the case if he had  denied  that  the  DRC  authorities
     would mistreat such persons. If, on the other hand, the assertion  that
     there are no problems with the migratory detention centres  unless  the
     DRC authorities are  dealing  with  persons  who  have  been  "unjustly
     refused asylum"  is  attributable  to  Mr.  Kennes  himself,  then  the
     Appellant's evidence itself shows that it  is  safe  to  return  failed
     asylum seekers to the DRC, provided their  claims  have  been  properly
     assessed.

10.6  The second letter (from the UNHCR) is dated November  2001.  We  noted
     that this letter was addressed to Mr. Zohreh Neinzi of  the  Devon  Law
     Centre. We do not know whether this letter was prepared in respect of a
     specific proposed returnee. However, even if this letter is of  general
     application, the  letter  only  states  that  the  UNHCR  is  aware  of
     "instances" where interrogation at the airport  has  been  followed  by
     arbitrary detention and serious ill-treatment. The  standard  of  proof
     for showing that returned failed asylum seekers would receive treatment
     amounting to persecution or in breach of Article 3 is that  of  a  real
     risk or a real likelihood. Of course, guarantees cannot be  given.  The
     fact that there are "instances" where interrogation at the airport  has
     been followed by arbitrary detention and serious  ill-treatment  simply
     is not sufficient to discharge the low standard of proof.

10.7  We considered that the final sentence  of  the  UNHCR's  letter  would
     only apply if the returnee's background is such that there  is  a  real
     risk  that  he  or  she  would  be  of  adverse  interest  to  the  DRC
     authorities. As we have already stated above, we are  here  considering
     the risk on return for persons whose backgrounds have been found to  be
     such that there is no real risk of adverse attention from the DRC.

10.8  The first letter (from Amnesty International) is dated  January  2001.
     The letter does not provide details such as whether persons other  than
     the three who were detained at Makala were returned to the DRC and what
     happened to the others. Neither does the  letter  provide  any  details
     about the background of the three persons who were detained. Are  they,
     for example, persons whose asylum claims ought to have been allowed but
     who somehow "slipped through the net" and therefore persons who (in the
     words used in the second press article, were "unjustly refused asylum"?
     We considered it inconceivable that,  if  there  was  a  real  risk  of
     persecution in the DRC for returning failed asylum seekers in the  DRC,
     the letter from the UNHCR (which post-dates  the  letter  from  Amnesty
     International) would not have made this clear.

10.9  We entirely accept that, if there is  a  real  risk  that  a  returned
     failed asylum seeker would  be  transferred  to  a  prison  or  illegal
     detention centre whilst they  are  interrogated  and/or  enquiries  are
     conducted  into  their  backgrounds,  then  he  or  she  would  receive
     treatment amounting to persecution or in breach of  Article  3,  either
     because of the general conditions they are likely  to  have  to  endure
     and/or because of the treatment which, as detainees, they are likely to
     be subjected to by those detaining  them.  Whether  there  would  be  a
     Convention reason for the purposes of the 1951  Refugee  Convention  is
     something which we do not need to determine in this particular appeal.

10.10 However, the evidence before us simply does not show, even to the  low
     standard, that there is  a  real  risk  that  returning  failed  asylum
     seekers would be transferred to prisons or illegal  detention  centres.
     Mr. Gaskin's submission was that, given that illegal detention  centres
     are operated by the ANR  and  given  that  the  ANR's  responsibilities
     include border security matters, this means that there is a  real  risk
     that returning failed asylum seekers would be  transferred  to  illegal
     detention centres. We do not accept that submission, as it is based  on
     pure supposition. Furthermore, if this was the fate of returning failed
     asylum seekers, we would expect to see reports from international human
     rights organisations to this effect.  What  little  evidence  has  been
     drawn to our attention relates the persons whose backgrounds would draw
     adverse attention - for example, the report of the  Special  Rapporteur
     on page 22 of Mr. Kennes' report which refers to ten UDPS leaders being
     transferred to unknown detention  centres.  We  cannot  conceive  that,
     given the procedures and appeal rights which are in place in the United
     Kingdom  for  refugee  status  determination  and  given  the   current
     objective evidence, UDPS leaders would feature  amongst  failed  asylum
     seekers being returned to the DRC by the United  Kingdom.  The  context
     suggests that the UDPS  leaders  were  in  detention  following  arrest
     within the DRC.

10.11 We note that Mr. Kennes states that returnees from the United  Kingdom
     are viewed with more suspicion. We have no reason to  take  issue  with
     this. However, if returning  failed  asylum  seekers  from  the  United
     Kingdom are at real risk of persecution after arrival in  the  DRC,  we
     (again) considered it inconceivable that the UNHCR would not say so.

10.12 We have been provided (on behalf of the Respondent) with a copy  of  a
     letter from the British Ambassador in Kinshasa dated 22nd November 2002
     addressed to the Immigration and Nationality Directorate.  This  letter
     states:

            In answer to your recent enquiry I can confirm  that,  since  my
           appointment to Kinshasa in May 2000, this Embassy has  not  come
           across any evidence that  DRC  nationals  forcibly  returned  to
           Kinshasa after failing to obtain political  asylum  in  European
           countries have faced persecution from the DRC authorities.

            The Belgian and French  governments  regularly  forcibly  return
           failed asylum seekers to Kinshasa; the Dutch government returned
           a group of 48 on 20 November. The local Embassies of these three
           countries have told me that the essential  requirement  for  DRC
           Immigration is acceptable identification documents.

            I am  not  in  a  position  to  offer  assurances  however  that
           returnees would not face prosecution if it were established that
           they had left the DRC without the mandatory travel documents, or
           if they had been the subject of criminal arrest warrants  or  of
           legal investigation prior to their original departure.

10.13 Mr. Gaskin submitted that, given that returned failed  asylum  seekers
     are not British nationals, there is  no  reason  to  suppose  that  the
     British Embassy would receive information about the  fate  of  returned
     failed asylum seekers.  We  can  see  some  merit  in  this  assertion.
     However, it is evident, from the letter from  the  British  Ambassador,
     that the Ambassador had been in touch with the embassies of three other
     governments, all of which have forcibly returned failed asylum  seekers
     to the DRC. We are  aware  that  there  are  numerous  non-governmental
     international organisations which are interested in  the  human  rights
     situations in countries across the globe,  including  the  DRC.  It  is
     inconceivable that, if returned failed asylum  seekers  (regardless  of
     their background) had encountered persecutory treatment or treatment in
     breach of Article 3 simply on account of being failed  asylum  seekers,
     this would not be reported. We have not had produced to us any  reports
     which show that returned failed asylum seekers are, simply  on  account
     thereof, at risk in the DRC. The lack of any  such  evidence,  together
     with the lack of any general advice  from  the  UNHCR  that  it  is  at
     present not safe in general to return failed asylum seekers to the  DRC
     is, in our view, significant.

10.14 Mr. Gaskin submitted that it should not be assumed that conditions  in
     migratory detention centres are any better than  those  in  prisons  or
     illegal detention centres. However,  there  is  a  complete  dearth  of
     evidence about the conditions in migratory detention centres. We  again
     revert to the fact that no evidence has been produced from human rights
     organisations that returned failed asylum seekers  receive  persecutory
     treatment or treatment in breach of Article 3. We again revert  to  the
     fact that the UNHCR has not said that it is  at  present  not  safe  to
     return failed asylum seekers to the DRC. This in spite of the fact that
     the evidence is that returns are being effected.

10.15 We have no reason to suppose that the Respondent would seek to  remove
     any failed asylum seekers to the DRC without valid  identification  and
     travel  documentation.  Indeed,  the  Bulletin  numbered  1/2003  dated
     January 2003 issued by  CIPU  on  the  DRC  suggests  that  the  delays
     currently being experienced in effecting removals to  the  DRC  are  on
     account of the administrative problems of  obtaining  travel  documents
     from the DRC Embassy in London - which suggests that removals are  only
     effected after proper documentation is in place.

10.16 Accordingly, we have concluded, on the whole of  the  evidence  before
     us, that failed asylum seekers are not at real risk of being  subjected
     by the DRC authorities to treatment which amounts to persecution or  in
     breach of Article 3, simply because they are failed asylum seekers. The
     Tribunal's Determination in Mozu should not be  regarded  as  authority
     for the proposition that failed asylum seekers are at such risk (if  it
     ever was) and should no longer be cited.

      Issue 2 - The challenge to the credibility findings:

11.1  Mr. Gaskin submitted that the Appellant had not claimed  to  have  any
     knowledge of Mrs. Kapend, the first wife of Mr. Kapend. She stated that
     she did not know Mrs. Kapend's name because she could  not  enquire  of
     her friend Micheline as that would be insulting to Micheline. When  she
     referred to her arrest, she said that she was with her friend Micheline
     who she might have referred to as Mrs. Kapend. When the Appellant  said
     that she had received packages from Mrs. Kapend, she was  referring  to
     her friend Micheline and not Mrs. Kapend, who the Appellant had  always
     maintained she had never known.

11.2. Ms. Hanrahan accepted that � 14  of  the  Adjudicator's  Determination
     was somewhat  confusing.  However,  the  Adjudicator  had  given  other
     reasons for rejecting the credibility of the Appellant's claims  -  for
     example, the Appellant had not been consistent as to the nature of  the
     goods she had traded in, the lack of any documentary  evidence  of  the
     commando raid on the  detention  centre  and  the  fact  that  she  had
     remained in the DRC  for  11  months  after  her  alleged  escape.  Ms.
     Hanrahan submitted  that,  overall,  the  Adjudicator's  findings  were
     sound.

      Determination of Issue 2:

12.   Whilst we acknowledge that the  Adjudicator  gave  other  reasons  for
     rejecting the credibility of the Appellant's claims, we considered that
     it was clear from the Determination  that  the  main  reasons  why  the
     Adjudicator rejected the credibility  of  the  Appellant's  claims  was
     because she had not been able to provide the first name of the wife  of
     Mr. Kapend and the  fact  that  the  Adjudicator  considered  that  the
     Appellant had been inconsistent in her accounts as to the  place  where
     she was arrested.  In  our  view,  the  explanations  offered  for  the
     credibility  issues   (�   11.1   above)   render   the   Adjudicator's
     Determination  unsafe,  given  that  the  explanations  have  not  been
     considered. This is not to say that the explanations  offered  will  be
     accepted as credible. That is a matter for the Adjudicator hearing  the
     appeal afresh to determine in the light of all of the evidence.

      Decision

      The appeal is allowed, to the extent that the appeal is  remitted  for
     fresh hearing before an Adjudicator other than Mr. F R C Such.
