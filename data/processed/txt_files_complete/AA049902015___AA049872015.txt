                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants,  mother  and  dependent  minor  daughter,  citizens  of
    Nigeria, appeal against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Pacey
    promulgated 1.7.15, dismissing on  all  grounds  their  linked  appeals
    against the decisions of the Secretary of State, dated 4.3.15 & 5.3.15,
    to refuse  their  asylum,  humanitarian  protection  and  human  rights
    claims, and to remove them from the UK.  The Judge heard the appeal  on
    17.6.15.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Brunnen  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    24.7.15, limited to the first ground only.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 16.2.16 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. For the reasons set out herein, I find no material error of law in  the
    making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal such  as  to  require
    the decision of Judge Pacey to be set aside.

 5. In summary, the grounds of application for permission to  appeal  argue
    that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  failed  to  consider  the  best
    interests of the son of the first appellant. However, it was the  first
    appellant's case that she intended to leave her son with  a  friend  in
    the UK and go to live permanently in Dubai.

 6. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Brunnen noted  that  given  the
    first appellant's intentions to leave her son behind in the  UK  whilst
    she went to make a new life for herself in Dubai, consideration of  the
    best interests of her son may not have assisted her  in  resisting  her
    removal from the UK, but that it was arguable that those best interests
    should have been considered.

 7. The grounds also submitted that the judge erred in finding  the  option
    of internal relocation open to the appellants and  failed  to  consider
    background evidence relating to  the  cruelty  suffered  by  widows  in
    Nigeria. However, Judge Brunnen noted, for good reason, that neither of
    these grounds identify any arguable error in the decision.  "The  judge
    gave clear and sufficient reasons to support her findings in respect of
    internal relocation. There was no independent evidence before the Judge
    of cruelty to widows. The grounds do not identify the evidence that the
    judge is said to have failed to consider."

 8. With respect, I fully agree with the observations of Judge  Brunnen  in
    relation to internal relocation and 'cruelty  to  widows'  issues.  The
    grounds make vague and unsubstantiated assertions in  regard  to  these
    issues. However, it follows that the only ground  on  which  permission
    was granted  relates  entirely  to  the  first  appellant.  The  second
    appellant did not renew the application for permission to appeal to the
    Upper Tribunal and thus there is no valid appeal to the Upper  Tribunal
    in the case of the  second  appellant.  In  the  circumstances,  I  can
    consider the second appellant's case no further.

 9. Mr Muman pointed out the limited references to the minor child  of  the
    first appellant, a dependent on her asylum  claim,  beginning  at  �12,
    where he is not named. Other references appear at �27, �72, �73.  Other
    references to best interests are in relation to the second  appellant's
    child, at �62 and �104. Mr Muman submitted that  the  judge  failed  to
    take into account the circumstances of the child of the first appellant
    and made a number of submissions about this child having entered the UK
    in 2010 as a visitor in the company of the first and second appellants.
    He is now 16, has been in state education since 2011, is  studying  for
    GCSEs, and is alleged to have a wide circle of friends.

10. Nevertheless, Mr Mills conceded that there  ought  to  have  been  some
    consideration of the best interests of the first appellant's child  and
    that the failure to do so was an error.

11. However, for the reasons set out below, I accept Mr  Mills'  submission
    that this omission was not and could not  have  been  material  to  the
    outcome of the appeal.

12. There is no witness statement from this child. In fact, there is barely
    any reference to this child in the witness  statements  of  either  the
    first or second appellants. There  was  very  little  evidence  in  the
    appellants' bundle of 32 pages that related to this  child,  only  some
    minor reference naming him at school. There  was  no  evidence  of  the
    claimed wide circle of friends or of any private life outside the  home
    other than the bare fact he was at school and pursuing GCSEs.

13. There was nothing advanced at the First-tier Tribunal  in  evidence  or
    submissions to suggest that the best interests of this child outweighed
    the public interest in removal of the appellants. The  first  appellant
    was on her way to Dubai, having left the child in the care of a friend,
    and intending to apply for asylum and  settle  in  Dubai.  The  history
    demonstrates that she did something similar previously. She brought the
    child to the UK in 2010 but then returned to Nigeria, leaving him  here
    in the UK until she returned in 2012. Frankly, there  was  no  evidence
    before the First-tier Tribunal to suggest that the  best  interests  of
    the child required the first appellant to be permitted to remain in the
    UK. There was no evidence to suggest that her intentions in leaving him
    behind were not in fact in his best interests. Even if he had to return
    to Nigeria with his mother,  the  refusal  decision  pointed  out  that
    education is available in Nigeria. There was no evidence  of  any  ties
    outside the home. In short, on the peculiar circumstances of this  case
    and in the absence of  any  significant  evidence  in  support,  it  is
    impossible to construct a best interests argument that could even begin
    to outweigh the public interest in removal of the  first  appellant  to
    Nigeria, whether or not the child accompanied her.

14. The reliance on this ground of appeal  at  this  late  stage  when  the
    child's interests were not advanced by the appellants at the First-tier
    Tribunal, if not ignored  entirely,  and  certainly  not  supported  by
    evidence, amounts to no more that a searching around for some straw  to
    clutch at to resist the first appellant's removal from the UK following
    the complete failure of her asylum  claim.  In  the  circumstances,  if
    there was an error of law in the judge's failure to  address  the  best
    interests of the child, it was not  material  to  the  outcome  of  the
    appeal.

Conclusions:

15. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

                    I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeals  of  each  appellant  remain  dismissed  on  all
                    grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did make an order.

Given the circumstances, I continue the anonymity order.


Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable in this case and thus there can be no fee award.
