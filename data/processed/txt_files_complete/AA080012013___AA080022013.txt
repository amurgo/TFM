Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr C Lane, instructed by Braitch RB Solicitors
For the respondent:    Ms C Johnstone, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants, RA, date of  birth  13.1.76,  and  SA,  date  of  birth
    23.9.04, are citizens of Pakistan.

 2. This are their appeals against the determination of First-tier Tribunal
    Judge Fox, promulgated 5.2.14, dismissing their linked appeals  against
    the decisions of the respondent, dated 2.8.13, to refuse their  asylum,
    humanitarian protection, and human rights claims.  The Judge heard  the
    appeal on 13.1.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Reid refused permission to appeal on 27.2.14.
    However, when renewed to the Upper Tribunal Upper Tribunal Judge  Coker
    granted permission to appeal on 27.2.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 21.10.14 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Fox should be set aside.

 6. The relevant background to the appeal can be summarised as follows.  On
    17.5.03 the first appellant underwent an arranged marriage in Pakistan.
    She claims  that  her  husband  was  physically  and  sexually  abusive
    throughout the marriage, until  he  threw  her  out  on  22.3.04,  with
    kicking, metal and cigarette burns, and raping her. After separation he
    continued to threaten her life, to the extent that she felt  she  could
    not live safely with her parents and  went  to  reside  with  different
    relatives from time to time, between 2004 and 2006.  The  divorce  took
    place in 2005. However, her ex-husband sought to gain custody of  their
    child, the second appellant.  According  to  the  first  appellant  the
    outcome of court proceedings was that the child would remain  with  her
    until 7 years of age. She was required to take her son to court once  a
    month; sometimes her husband was present.

 7. The first appellant claims that in 2007 her  ex-husband  kidnapped  her
    son from the court for 9  hours,  before  returning  him.  She  stopped
    attending court,  but  bailiffs  came  to  her  home,  so  she  resumed
    attending court on a monthly basis. She claims that her husband  chased
    her through the market on one occasion in 2009 and a few days later  he
    kidnapped the child from school. She was made to sign a blank sheet  of
    paper to enable her son to be returned to her. She  believed  this  was
    intended to obtain the withdrawal of  a  child  maintenance  and  dowry
    claim she had made against him. Although she  changed  the  school  she
    worked at, in January 2010 she received a message from her husband that
    he knew she was working there, that  he  was  still  pursuing  her  and
    intended to 'wreck' her face.  She  came  to  the  UK  to  further  her
    education and to escape her ex-husband.  She  claims  she  intended  to
    return to Pakistan but was not prepared to hand over her son to her ex-
    husband.

 8. The appellants arrived in the UK on 7.10.10 with  leave  as  a  Tier  4
    (general) migrant student and dependant, under the points based  system
    (PBS) of the Immigration Rules. Leave was subsequently  extended  as  a
    Tier 1 (post study work) migrant to 31.5.14. However,  on  21.6.13  the
    first appellant claimed asylum. She claims that her ex-husband has been
    harassing and abusing her family  members  in  Pakistan,  firing  shots
    outside the home in August 2012 and April 2013. She and  her  son  have
    been badly affected by the past and continuing problems  from  her  ex-
    husband. She is suffering from depression and insomnia and her son, who
    has nightmares and trouble  sleeping,  has  received  counselling.  She
    believes that if she were returned to Pakistan her husband  would  kill
    her, and possibly their son. He is very wealthy  and  his  uncle  is  a
    politician in the People's Party.

 9. In granting permission to appeal, Judge  Coker  consider  it  arguable,
    "that the weight placed by the judge  and  the  interpretation  by  the
    judge of what may in some scenarios be seen  as  insignificant  matters
    has tainted his approach to the evidence as a  whole.  It  is  arguable
    that his interpretation, without reasons, of the first appellant's  ex-
    husband retention of the child for 9 hours/3  days  as  oppose  to  the
    agreed one hour  as  extended  custody  as  oppose  to  kidnapping  was
    irrational. It is arguable that the judge has failed  to  consider  the
    background material as regards access to the courts by  divorced  women
    in reaching his findings. Overall it is arguable that the assessment of
    evidence  and  the  lack  of  reasoning  for  some  findings   may   be
    irrational."

10. The Rule 24  response,  dated  9.5.14,  submits  that  the  judge  made
    reasonable, sustainable findings that were open to him on the evidence.
    "The respondent submits that the grounds advanced do not  disclose  any
    material arguable errors of law and are in mere disagreement  with  the
    negative outcome of the appeal. The determination is  a  very  detailed
    and balanced evaluation of the material facts and  supporting  evidence
    of the appellants' claim and it is submitted that the findings spanning
    across paragraphs numbered 70-149 were properly  open  to  the  learned
    judge to make. On the  material  facts  of  this  case,  no  reasonably
    alternative constituted Tribunal  could  possibly  have  arrived  at  a
    materially different outcome to that of this Tribunal."

11. At the outset of the hearing  the  parties  agreed  that  the  relevant
    issues were, PSG, (particular social group),  credibility,  section  55
    best interests of the child, and articles 2,3 and 8 ECHR. It was agreed
    that the medical issues were confined to article 8 and  article  3  was
    not relied on.

12. I find that Judge Fox conducted  a  very  detailed  assessment  of  the
    appellants' case, in a decision  running  to  151  paragraphs  over  22
    pages.

13. The first appellant did not give oral evidence, as she  had  apparently
    taken medication. Her sister, with whom the appellants had lived  since
    arriving in the UK, gave oral evidence, which is set out in some length
    between �25 and �56 of the decision. The findings of fact are  set  out
    in detail over 12 pages, between �70 and �151. I note  that  the  first
    appellant has disputed many of the findings, though some of them  arose
    from her sister's oral evidence.

14. Rather oddly, at �20 Judge Fox decided that he would not consider  some
    of the relevant case law, because it was promulgated after the  refusal
    decision. That was an error of law; the judge is required to apply  all
    relevant case law. There is also an incomplete  sentence  with  missing
    content at �12, but �23 suggests that it related to the  OGN  submitted
    in closing submissions. However, in  the  circumstances  of  this  case
    neither these errors nor minor factual  errors  are  not  material.  In
    fact, taking an overall view of both the evidence and the way in  which
    Judge Fox addressed that evidence it  is  difficult  to  conceive  that
    there could have been any other outcome than a dismissal of the claims.



15. In summary, Judge Fox found the  evidence  adduced  on  behalf  of  the
    appellants unreliable and in particular was satisfied  that  the  first
    appellant's  sister  was  not  a  witness  of  truth,   gave   evidence
    inconsistent with the first appellant's account, and was  rehearsing  a
    false asylum claim, as was  the  first  appellant.  At  �92  the  judge
    concluded that the sister had improvised some of  her  evidence.  These
    were all findings open to the judge,  having  heard  the  evidence  and
    being able to assess the witness.

16. The judge concluded that on consideration of the evidence in the  round
    the allegation of kidnapping  was  an  embellishment.  Considering  the
    claim in the context of the  court  proceedings  and  the  ex-husband's
    right of access, the judge reached the conclusion that the evidence did
    not possess the features of kidnapping. On the first occasion the child
    was brought back to court after 9 hours.  In  relation  to  the  second
    occasion, it is clear from �81  that  the  judge  did  not  accept  the
    factual account and gave clear reasons for that conclusion.

17. The findings also set out discrepancies, inconsistencies and  parts  of
    the account that the judge concluded were not credible. I find  on  any
    assessment that the judge has given cogent  reasons  for  the  findings
    reached and that they were sustainable on the evidence, even  if  there
    were some minor factual inaccuracies in the summary given.

18. The judge gave clear reasons for rejecting many of the documents relied
    on by the appellants, including court  documents,  police  reports  and
    affidavits. The judge did not find it credible that the ex-husband with
    the alleged behaviour and ability to act with impunity as described  by
    the first appellant would co-operate in civil proceedings; wait some  5
    years before allegedly kidnapping the second appellant;  or  co-operate
    in the appellants leaving Pakistan to migrate to the  UK.  At  �97  the
    judge noted that documentation in relation to  the  latter  action  was
    inconsistent with the first appellant's claim that he was unaware  that
    she was bringing the second appellant to the UK.

19. The judge also grappled with the expert evidence, including medical and
    expert opinion, setting out in considerable detail the deficiencies  of
    the latter. At �120 the judge found  that  there  was  no  causal  link
    between the allegation of domestic violence, which was not accepted  by
    the judge, and the first appellant's mental health, concluding that her
    mental health was directly linked to her legal issues, but noting  that
    she has now abandoned any suicidal ideation. At �123 and again at  �128
    the judge concluded that when the evidence is considered in the  round,
    he found the first appellant to be a manipulative individual who  seeks
    to exploit the medical services and as such,  �132  no  weight  can  be
    placed on the social services report, "which is most likely the product
    of manipulative and unreliable statements made by the  first  appellant
    for the reasons stated."

20. At �142 the judge concluded that after considering  the  relevant  case
    law, there was no reliable  evidence  to  demonstrate  that  the  first
    appellant is at risk as claimed and in particular  that  she  does  not
    meet the requirements of KA.

21. The judge went on to consider the appellants' claims  under  article  8
    ECHR, taking into account section 55 and best interests of  the  second
    appellant child, referencing both Azimi-Moyad and Zoumbas.

22. Having considered the grant of permission  I  am  satisfied  that  what
    Judge  Coker  thought  arguable  as  irrational  in  relation  to   the
    kidnapping issue, is not borne out be  a  careful  examination  of  the
    decision of Judge Fox. He was not characterising the retention  of  the
    child for 3 hours, or for 3 days  on  a  separate  occasion  as  merely
    "extended custody." The judge rejected the second  incident  altogether
    and gave cogent reasons for finding  that  in  relating  to  the  first
    incident the first appellant was  exaggerating  her  claim,  which  the
    judge considered in the context of  the  claimed  history  between  the
    first appellant and her ex-husband and the court  proceedings.  I  find
    nothing irrational about  the  conclusions  drawn,  which  are  clearly
    supported by cogent reasons. Whilst  another  judge  may  have  reached
    different conclusions, it cannot be said that the findings of Judge Fox
    were irrational or perverse.

23. Much of the criticism of Judge Fox's  determination  contained  in  the
    grounds and the oral submissions is no more than  a  disagreement  with
    his findings and an attempt to reargue the case.  Given  the  extensive
    treatment of the evidence, if anything in an overly-detailed manner,  I
    do not accept that the judge has not taken all  of  the  evidence  into
    account in reaching his findings of fact. To the contrary, it is  clear
    that he has made a careful assessment of all of the evidence.

24. The grounds of appeal have  to  be  considered  in  the  light  of  the
    findings as a whole. At the heart of the  difficulties  for  the  first
    appellant in seeking to appeal the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal
    is that her alleged ex-husband (the judge was  not  in  fact  satisfied
    that she was divorced as claimed) gave  her  permission  to  bring  the
    second appellant to the UK and thus for her to have sole custody of him
    for an indefinite period of time. Despite the first appellant's attempt
    to deny that he knew the child was accompanying  her,  contradicted  by
    the documentary evidence, nothing in the evidence before the First-tier
    Tribunal dislodges that fact, which rather undermines  the  appellant's
    account and stands in stark contrast  to  the  dark  portrait  she  has
    attempted to paint of her ex-husband.

25. In short, the judge  did  not  accept  the  first  appellant's  factual
    background, including her account of history with  her  ex-husband  and
    the difficulties in Pakistan of which she complained. The  judge  found
    that the first appellant was in fact fabricating her account  and  that
    her claim was "rejected in substance" (�120), and at �126 that  it  was
    reasonable  to  conclude,  in  the   light   of   inconsistencies   and
    discrepancies in the evidence, that  "the  first  appellant  cannot  be
    relied  upon  to  provide  an  honest  or  reliable  account   of   her
    circumstances." At �130 the judge did not accept the claim that her two
    female cousins had been the victims of honour  killings.  At  �128  and
    elsewhere in the determination, the judge found that the appellant  was
    manipulative and had  manipulated  and  exploited  medical  and  social
    services in the UK to promote a false asylum claim.

26. The judge also considered at �144 that in the alternative the  evidence
    demonstrated  that  the  appellants  have  the   option   of   internal
    relocation.

27. The only ground of any potential merit was that the judge has failed to
    consider the relevant background material as regards child contact  and
    divorced women in Pakistan.  However,  a  number  of  findings  in  the
    decision render this issue largely irrelevant as inconsistent with  the
    conclusions of the judge on the first appellant's factual claim.

28. At �110 the judge found that on the available evidence that  the  first
    appellant has effective support from male relatives and extended family
    members, who were able to make complaint to the  police.  At  �113  the
    judge found that the evidence demonstrated that the first appellant has
    enjoyed historic and effective support from her  family  and  that  the
    family is wealthy, as  confirmed  by  the  first  appellant's  sister's
    evidence.  Her  father  is  a  retired  civil  servant.  She   received
    protection and support from her family (�119). In addition,  the  first
    appellant's employment prospects in Pakistan are good. It is clear from
    �133 that the judge did not accept that the first  appellant  had  been
    beaten with an iron bar. More significantly, after  assessing  all  the
    evidence, at �142 the judge  concluded  that,  "there  is  no  reliable
    evidence to demonstrate that the first appellant is at risk as  claimed
    for the reasons stated." It is also  clear  that  the  judge  found  no
    reliable evidence that her husband has brought  a  charge  of  adultery
    against her, despite several years  of  opportunity  and  an  allegedly
    vengeful motivation to do so. At �144 the judge did not accept that the
    transfer of custody of the second appellant to the  father  is  a  fait
    accompli, relying on paragraph 23.79 of the COI report,  "or  that  the
    father would require formal custody of  the  second  appellant  in  any
    event, when one considers  that  the  first  appellant  has  failed  to
    provide reliable evidence that she is divorced as claimed and therefore
    it follows that she has failed to provide reliable evidence that she is
    estranged from her husband as claimed. In the alternative there  is  no
    reliable evidence that the husband would seek to deny  contact  between
    the appellants."

29. The judge also concluded from �116-120 that the first appellant is  not
    at risk of suicide or self-harm but that if there are any mental health
    issues, which he doubted, they do not relate to  any  alleged  domestic
    violence  or  her  circumstances  in  Pakistan,  but   her   precarious
    immigration status in the UK. If she ever had them, she  has  abandoned
    any self-harm or suicidal intentions. At �135 and  onwards,  the  judge
    gave reasons for not accepting that the appellant suffers from PTSD. If
    she is in need of any mental health treatment,  the  judge  found  that
    such treatment is available in Pakistan.

30. Some of Mr Lane's submissions were  in  fact  made  in  error,  perhaps
    compounded by the fact that he  was  not  at  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    appeal hearing and was unaware of what material had been placed  before
    the judge and what issues were in contention. For example, he  drew  my
    attention to the GP's letter at A37 to contradict the  judge's  finding
    at �116 that the first appellant did not display any signs of  suicidal
    ideation. However, Mr Lane appeared to be unaware  that  the  GP  notes
    forming the source material, not in the appellant's  bundle,  had  been
    handed in at the appeal hearing and that these  bear  out  the  judge's
    findings.

31. Mr Lane was also relying on a passage in the psychiatric report  by  Dr
    Dhumad at �17(g). However, unknown to him, the part he was  relying  on
    had been redacted and was no longer relied on by the  first  appellant.
    Mr Lane was also relying in his submissions on  certain  documents,  an
    application and letter, that had not in fact been produced to the First-
    tier Tribunal.

32. In the circumstances, I reach the conclusion  that  the  criticisms  of
    Judge Fox are of the 'nit-picking' variety, attempting  to  disassemble
    what was a very comprehensive assessment of  the  entire  evidence  and
    issues before him. The submissions are largely argumentative and in  my
    view amount to no more  than  a  disagreement  with  the  findings,  an
    attempt to reargue the case in the Upper Tribunal. I find that  in  his
    lengthy submissions Mr Lane has distinctly failed to identify to me any
    findings which could be regarded  as  irrational  or  perverse  or  not
    capable of being supported by the evidence.

Conclusion & Decision:

33. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed on all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal made  an  order  pursuant  to  rule  45(4)(i)  of  the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I continue the anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable in this case.
