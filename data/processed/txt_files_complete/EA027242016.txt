                      ERROR OF LAW DECISION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant appeals against the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal
      (Judge N Haria) (FtT) promulgated on 31st  July  2017,  in  which  the
      appeal against the Respondent's decision dated 17.2.2016 refusing  the
      application for a permanent residence card
         (Regulations 10 & 15 EEA Regulations 2006), was dismissed.

Background
2.   The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan.  He claims to have entered  the
    UK on 19.9.2006 although the respondent has no record of the entry.  He
    was issued with a residence card valid until 18.10.2015. On  12.10.2015
    he  applied  for  permanent  residence.   The  respondent  refused  the
    application on  the  grounds  that  the  appellant  failed  to  provide
    evidence of his spouse having exercised free movement at  the  time  of
    the divorce (decree absolute dated 9.9.2015), of the  marriage  lasting
    for 3 years, of one year's  residence in the UK and that the  appellant
    was exercising Treaty rights as if an EEA national.

First-tier Tribunal decision
3.   The FtT found that the marriage had lasted for 3  years  and  that  the
    appellant resided in the UK for one year [24].  The FtT had evidence of
    the spouse's tax documentation which showed that she was employed  from
    2010 - 2015.  In addition there was an SA 302 for the tax  year  ending
    in April 2012 showing income of ï¿½7545.00 and NI contributions made, and
    a letter from HMRC confirming NI was paid for periods from 2011 to 2013
    [27].  In addition the appellant produced  invoices  for  2010  -  2015
    contract for cleaning services and bank statements. The FtT found  that
    the spouse was working as a  cleaner  [28]  but  that  the  documentary
    evidence was insufficient to show that the spouse was  working  at  the
    date of divorce [37].  The most upto date evidence was upto 31st August
    2015 and the credit of a cheque into the bank account on 2.9.2015 [37].



Grounds of appeal
4.   In grounds of appeal  the  appellant  argued  that  the  FtT  erred  by
    failing to take into account the  EEA  Regulations  applicable  to  the
    application that  was  for  permanent  residence  as  distinct  from  a
    retained right of residence (OA (EEA - retained right  of  residence  )
    Nigeria [2010] UKAIT 00003.

5.   In any event the FtT erred in its approach to Regulation 10(5) in  that
    no reason was given for concluding that Regulation 10(5)  was  not  met
    [40].  The appellant argued that the 5 year period  was  met  from  the
    date  of  marriage  on  9.11.2009  to  November  2014  and  there   was
    documentary evidence for that period.

6.   The FtT erred by failing to look at the 5 year period from the date  of
    marriage and considering instead the 5 years preceding the divorce. The
    evidence adduced and that relating to the 2012 period showed  that  the
    EEA spouse was working during the 5 year period from the marriage  (Iza
    Tom Idezuna (EEA- permanent residence) Nigeria [2011] UKUT 00474 (IAT).



Permission to appeal
7.   Permission to  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  (UT)  was  granted  by
    Designated Judge of the FTT Macdonald on  24.1.2018.  It  was  arguable
    that it was an error in law  for  the  FtT  not  to  consider  material
    evidence.


Submissions
8.   At the hearing before me Mr Kumi  submitted  a  skeleton  argument  and
    submitted that the  FtT failed  to  determine  the  core  issue  namely
    whether or not the appellant had lived in the UK  for  a  period  of  5
    years in accordance with the EEA Regulations and that he was  a  family
    member with a retained right of residence. The Respondent and  the  FtT
    were wrong to focus on Regulation 10(5).  There was evidence before the
    FtT to show that the spouse was working.

9.   In response Mr Bramble contended that it was difficult to see  how  the
    appeal was presented on the day in the FtT and whether  the  Judge  had
    been made aware of the  accrued  5  year  period  from  November  2009?
    Although this was a clear error, Mr Bramble argued that  this  Tribunal
    was not in position to re make the decision on the  available  evidence
    if the starting date was taken from November 2009 as there was a gap of
    some months from 9.11.2009 - 1.3.2010 for the spouse's  employment  and
    there were concerns that the income was so low that this could  not  be
    genuine employment.

10.  Mr Kumi responded that there was documentary evidence to show that  the
    regulations were met, including  the  HMRC  documentation  and  it  was
    irrational to raise the issue of low income in the circumstances.

Discussion and conclusion
11.  There is a material error of law in the decision  which  shall  be  set
    aside save for the preserved findings made below.  The  FtT  failed  to
    apply the correct approach to the relevant EEA regulations.   This  was
    an application for permanent residence under Regulation 15(f) EEA Regs.
    which the FtT  failed  to  apply  to  the  facts  and  focused  on  the
    requirements under Regulation 10. It was accepted  that  the  appellant
    married on 9.11.2009 and divorced on 9.9.2015.  He made his application
    for permanent residence on 12.10.2015 at which stage had had  lived  in
    the UK for just under 6 years.  If the period  of  residence  is  taken
    from the date of marriage then he satisfied the residence  requirements
    of Regulation 15 as at 9.11.2014 and thereafter once divorced he was  a
    family member with a retained right of residence. There  was  no  issue
    raised as to the continuity of residence. In the circumstances  it  was
    open to the appellant to apply for right of  residence  either  on  the
    basis of a  retained  right  of  residence  or  a  right  of  permanent
    residence (Samsan (EEA:revocation and  retained  rights)  Syria  [2011]
    UKUT 00165 (IAC) paragraphs 48-53).  Although  it  was  unclear  to  me
    whether it was argued at the FtT hearing that the start  date  was  the
    date of marriage, nevertheless there was an error  in  the  failure  to
    consider Regulation 15(1)(f) in this context.  I preserve the  findings
    made by the FtT as to the genuineness of the bank statements [32],  the
    level of income [39], the length of marriage and residence  in  the  UK
    [24], the appellant's employment [25], the  spouse's  employment  as  a
    cleaner [30].

Re making
12.  I go on to remake the decision.  I am satisfied that the appellant  has
    shown evidence that his wife was exercising Treaty  rights  during  the
    period of the marriage  up  until  9.11.2014  and  that  the  appellant
    himself was self employed up to and since the date of the divorce. This
    evidence included the affidavit of the ex spouse, a statement from  her
    former employer and the appellant's own witness statement all of  which
    are consistent evidence as to the  exercise  of  Treaty  rights.   This
    evidence meets the requirements of  Regulation  15(i)(f).   Taking  the
    start date as the date of marriage the appellant has met the five  year
    continuous residence at 9.11.2014 and that at the end  of  that  period
    the appellant  was  a  family  member  who  has  a  retained  right  of
    residence.  I find documentary evidence consistent with the appellant's
    wife being employed as a cleaner including the  period  2012  and  that
    there is no strong argument that the  low  earnings  in  2010  are  not
    capable  of  amounting  to  genuine  and  effective   employment   when
    considered in the context of the  financial/employment  evidence  as  a
    whole. This was considered by the FtT in any event. I am satisfied that
    the appellant has produced evidence that his wife  was  working  during
    the relevant 5 year period.  The profit and loss  account  is  for  the
    year ending March 2010 and which would include from April 2009 and  the
    invoice for the  same  month  is  number  25  which  suggests  previous
    invoices at earlier dates (G63) and there is a form SA 1035  for  April
    2009 to 2010 (F6). The period that the FtT found to be lacking  was  at
    the time of the divorce [35] which is beyond the  5  year  period.   In
    considering Regulation 15 the  respondent  made  no  reference  to  any
    circumstances why the appellant should not be issued with  a  permanent
    residence card.

Decision
13.  The decision that I re make is to allow the appellant's appeal.
