LLP


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. In a decision promulgated on the 9th October 2018, I held  that  whilst
    the primary factual findings of First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Myers  were
    unimpeachable, her assessment of the reasonableness internal relocation
    within Iraq was legally flawed. I now set out my own  conclusions  upon
    the issue of internal relocation having heard further evidence from the
    appellant's husband (BOA) at a hearing on the 9th January 2019.



Factual background

 2. The following factual findings of Judge Myers are preserved.

 3. The appellant is an Iraqi Kurd from Qaladze in the IKR where she  lived
    with her brother and widowed mother. She has three uncles. They  wanted
    her to marry her cousin.  However, in June 2016, she was introduced  by
    a work colleague to one 'BOA'. BOA lives in the  UK  but  was  visiting
    family in the IKR when they met. They  remained  in  contact  following
    BOA's return to the UK in August 2016.  They  subsequently  married  in
    secret whilst BOA was visiting the IKR between the 6th and 18th days of
    October 2016. In April 2017, one of the appellant's uncles (MR) renewed
    pressure on her to marry  his  son.  At  that  point,  the  appellant's
    brother was forced to reveal that the appellant  was  already  married.
    Her uncle and his son then violently assaulted her brother and  held  a
    gun to the appellant's head. They forced her brother to give them BOA's
    telephone number and switched on the speakerphone as they informed  BOA
    that he had one month to divorce the  appellant  otherwise  they  would
    kill her. Her brother then arranged for the appellant to travel to  the
    UK.

The appellant's case at the hearing

 4. I did not hear evidence from the appellant. I did however hear evidence
    from her husband through the medium of a  Kurdish  Sorani  interpreter.
    This may be conveniently summarised as follows.

 5. The appellant gave birth to their daughter, BBO, on the 6th  July  2018
    and she is now pregnant  with  their  second  child.  BOA  was  granted
    indefinite leave to remain on the 19th October 2018 and  the  appellant
    made an application to register BBO as a British  citizen  on  the  5th
    December 2018. BOA is a director of Azamar Property Limited, trading as
    "Alldays". The appellant's family are from the Mangur Tribe with "close
    links  throughout  Kurdistan"  [BOA's  witness  statement  of  the  8th
    December 2018] and they would try to locate and kill  him  were  he  to
    return to the IKR. BOA would not return to Iraq in any circumstances.

Additional factual findings

 6. I am satisfied that (a) the appellant gave to birth to BBO on  the  6th
    July 2018 and is now pregnant with her husband's second child, and  (b)
    BOA was granted indefinite leave to  remain  in  the  UK  on  the  19th
    October  2018.  These  facts  have  been  substantiated   by   reliable
    documentary evidence that can be found in the appellant's supplementary
    bundle of documents. I am also willing to accept  BBO's  uncorroborated
    testimony that there is currently a pending application to register BBO
    as a British citizen.

 7. I do not however accept BBO's  claim  that  he  would  not  follow  his
    pregnant wife and his daughter if they were they forced  to  return  to
    Iraq. He had to be asked three times whether he would do so  before  he
    finally answered that question. His  first  two  replies  were  to  the
    effect that he had spent his "whole life" in the UK (which  is  not  of
    course true) and that he  had  his  own  business  here.  When  he  did
    eventually answer the question, he said that he would choose to  remain
    in the UK even if this meant being separated indefinitely from his wife
    and daughter. He then promptly contradicted this reply by  adding  that
    he would do everything in his power to protect  his  wife.  I  find  it
    wholly implausible that the appellant would consider it more  important
    to maintain his business links to the UK  than  preserve  a  meaningful
    relationship with his  wife  and  daughter  in  Iraq.  I  am  therefore
    satisfied that the appellant was being evasive because he feared that a
    straightforward and truthful reply would damage  his  wife's  case  for
    remaining in the UK. It follows from this that, contrary to the finding
    made by Judge Myers, the appellant  would  not  be  returning  to  Iraq
    without her husband.

 8. The following facts were agreed by the representatives at the  hearing.
    The population of the IKR is 5.7 million, the population of  the  Erbil
    governate is 2.1 million, and the population of Erbil City is 852,000.

The rival submissions

 9. Mrs Pettersen submitted that if the appellant and her husband were able
    to marry in secret they should have little  difficulty  in  maintaining
    their anonymity upon  relocating  within  the  IKR.  Whilst  there  was
    evidence of 'honour killings taking place  in  the  Danish  Immigration
    Service Report (beginning at  page  82  the  appellant's  supplementary
    bundle) it did not establish that the appellant's family would be  able
    to trace her whereabouts.

10. Mr Greer pointed out that three of the appellant's  uncles  were  high-
    ranking  officers  in  the  Peshmerga  (a  retired  Major  General,   a
    Brigadier, and a Lieutenant Colonel respectively). He drew attention to
    background country information demonstrating that BBO would also be  at
    risk of being killed by the appellant's family members in the IKR [page
    100 in the supplementary bundle] and to evidence of the whereabouts  of
    couples being traced and killed in the  IKR  for  perceived  crimes  of
    dishonour [page 105]. Even if the appellant and her husband  would  not
    be in danger upon relocating within the IKR, it would be  unduly  harsh
    to expect them to do so given (a) BOA's lack of  recent  experience  of
    living and working there, (b) the difficulties caused in providing care
    for two young children whilst supporting  themselves  financially,  (c)
    their natural reluctance to seek assistance from  the  IKR  authorities
    given the  associated  risk  of  giving  away  their  location  to  the
    appellant's relatives.

Analysis and conclusion

11. Notwithstanding their high-ranking positions in the Peshmerga, I am not
    satisfied that there is a real risk of  the  appellant's  uncles  being
    able to locate her in  a  city  with  a  population  of  852,000  in  a
    governorate with a population of 2.1 million. The only evidence to  the
    contrary comes from Hana  Swann  of  the  Women's  Media  and  Cultural
    Organization (WMCO) which appears in  the  Danish  Immigration  Service
    Report, beginning at page 103 of the appellant's bundle  of  documents.
    This gives a single example of a couple  being  killed  by  the  wife's
    family after "hiding for some time". I am struck by  the  vagueness  of
    this report. I also consider that the  source  of  the  information  is
    prone to exaggeration, given that s/he "did not reply"  when  asked  to
    give an example of the claim that couples have  been  traced  and  then
    killed after fleeing to Europe [paragraphs 87 to 89 at page 105].

12. I am however satisfied that it would be  unduly  harsh  to  expect  the
    appellant to relocate with her  husband  to  Erbil.  Although  BOA  has
    experience of working over many years in  the  UK,  this  has  been  in
    connection with the off-licence trade. Such experience is very unlikely
    to be of benefit to him in the IKR. Adding to his difficulties  is  the
    fact that he has not resided in the IKR for  some  eight  years.  Thus,
    whilst the appellant may have access  to  ï¿½1,500  under  the  Voluntary
    Returns Scheme, this would likely rapidly become exhausted by the costs
    of food and renting an apartment for a rent of between $300 and $400  a
    month [AAH Iraq CG]. It is thus unlikely to tide them  over  until  BOA
    was able to find work. They would thus likely find themselves forced to
    reside in 'critical shelter accommodation' of the type characterised as
    'unduly harsh' in AAH. Given that the appellant and her husband  appear
    to have been able to travel freely between Iraq and the UK in  2016,  I
    am not satisfied that they would face any significant  difficulties  in
    securing either a passport or a CSID card. There is however a real risk
    that they will face such difficulties in  relation  to  their  daughter
    whose existence, combined with the  fact  that  the  appellant  is  now
    pregnant, would compound the  practical  difficulties  of  her  parents
    relocating to an area with which neither of them  is  familiar  and  to
    which they have no existing social or economic ties. Whilst I have  not
    found their fear of being traced to Erbil well-founded, I  nevertheless
    accept that there is force in Mr Greer's point that the  appellant  may
    be reluctant to access local services as a  result  of  her  subjective
    fear that this may lead to her whereabouts being discovered.
