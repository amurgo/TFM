                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS



  1. This is an appeal against the decision of an Adjudicator, Dr R  Keki?,
     promulgated on 9th January 2004.  The Appellant is a  citizen  of  the
     C�te d'Ivoire born on 8th January 1968.   He  arrived  in  the  United
     Kingdom as a visitor on 27th July 2001.  Although he claimed  to  have
     gone to the Home Office in Croydon to seek an extension, there  is  no
     record of that.  In September 2003, he was arrested  on  suspicion  of
     being  an  overstayer  and  during  the  interview  conducted  by   an
     Immigration Officer he  claimed  asylum.   He  was  prosecuted  as  an
     overstayer.  He  was  found  guilty  and  on  8th  October  2003,  was
     sentenced to four month's imprisonment.  He was released from  Brixton
     Prison  on  21st  November  2003,  whereupon  he  was  transferred  to
     immigration detention.  On 2nd December 2003, he  was  transferred  to
     Harmondsworth, where he entered the fast track process.  The Secretary
     of State refused his asylum claim and gave directions for his  removal
     in a decision dated  16th  December  2003.   A  bail  application  was
     refused by an Adjudicator on 30th December 2003.  The  appeal  to  the
     Adjudicator under the fast track system was heard over the  course  of
     two days on 7th and 8th January 2004.

  2. The basis of  the  Appellant's  asylum  claim,  as  described  by  the
     Adjudicator, was that he was a well-known singer in the C�te d'Ivoire.
      His music, and in particular an album or single or musical called  El
     Mutino, on which he sang and which he had been involved in  producing,
     was appreciated by General Guei who assumed power following a coup  in
     December 1999.  El Mutino lauded  those  events.   The  Appellant  was
     believed by many in C�te d'Ivoire to be a supporter of  General  Guei.
     There had been a student meeting in April 2000 at which the  Appellant
     sang and at which the General had been criticised, which led to a raid
     by police on the campus and students had been arrested.  General  Guei
     had lost elections in October 2000, which had  led  to  his  music  no
     longer being played on the radio.  General Guei had subsequently  been
     killed in September 2002 in the course of an uprising against the  new
     President.  Mr Yace, who had helped produce  El  Mutino  and  was  the
     keyboard player with the Appellant, had also been  killed  in  October
     2002.  The Appellant believed that  he  would  be  at  risk  of  being
     killed, as someone believed through his music to  be  a  supporter  of
     General Guei.

  3. The Appellant said that he was married in a  traditional  marriage  in
     1995 to Elisabeth Ehouman, who was now in the United Kingdom and  that
     they had had two children born in  the  UK.   He  said  that  she  had
     arrived in the United Kingdom in May  2000  and  had  claimed  asylum.
     Although he said that he did not  know  her  current  status,  it  was
     apparent that she had been refused asylum  and  her  appeal  had  been
     dismissed on 3rd April 2001 by an Adjudicator.  This was apparent from
     the bundle produced by the Home Office for this Appellant's appeal  to
     the Adjudicator.

  4. The Adjudicator said that the main issues in the appeal were:

           "Whether the Appellant experienced the  problems  he  described,
           whether these were due to his actual or  perceived  support  for
           general Guei made apparent through his  music,  and  whether  he
           would be at risk for the same reason were he now  to  return  to
           the C�te d'Ivoire."


      She accepted that the Appellant was a musician and that  some  of  his
      songs had a political overtone.  These  were  facts  accepted  by  the
      Secretary of State and supported by objective evidence.  El Mutino was
      written in support of General Guei.  The Adjudicator accepted that  Mr
      Yace had had a role to play in its production and  that  Mr  Yace  had
      died of unnatural causes.  The Adjudicator,  however,  concluded  that
      none of those facts meant that the Appellant would be killed  were  he
      to be returned to the C�te d'Ivoire.  There was, she said, no evidence
      to suggest that those associated with Mr Yace were all at  risk.   She
      concluded that there was no evidence that  the  Appellant's  fear  was
      objectively well-founded.


  5. She rejected the reliability of the evidence  of  witnesses  who  gave
     evidence at the hearing in relation to circumstances in C�te  d'Ivoire
     because they had no first-hand knowledge of Mr Yace's death or of  any
     problems which the Appellant might have had;  they had obtained  their
     information only through the  media.   She  said  that  there  was  no
     evidence to suggest that all  supporters  of  the  late  General  were
     targeted or persecuted in the manner suggested by the  Appellant,  nor
     that they ever were, even after he had lost the  election  in  October
     2000.  The Appellant had only referred, despite repeated requests,  to
     country information which dealt with general unrest, the threat  of  a
     possible war and random abuses committed by the security forces during
     the period of unrest.  The Amnesty International Report of  May  2003,
     upon which the Appellant had put weight,  showed  that,  in  September
     2002, during the course of an uprising, General  Guei  and  some  high
     profile members of the Government closely  associated  with  him  were
     persecuted and killed by the security forces and that in  the  ensuing
     chaos many innocent people lost their lives.  But she said that it did
     not follow from this that the Appellant would be targeted  and  killed
     on his return:  there was no evidence to that effect.  She pointed out
     that although the General's son was detained following  the  death  of
     his father, no attempt to kill him had been  made  and  there  was  no
     reason to suppose that the Appellant would be pursued  or  pursued  in
     the same way in which the General's son had been.

  6. The Adjudicator concluded that reference to the volatile situation  in
     the western part of the country, massacres along the  Liberian  border
     and to the rebel areas in the north  were  of  no  assistance  to  the
     Appellant's claim because he would not be returning to  any  of  those
     areas.  The general instability of the position in C�te  d'Ivoire  did
     not suffice for his claim.  She concluded that it could not be  argued
     that the Appellant would face a real risk of breaches of his Article 2
     and 3 rights as a result of the general conflict were he to be removed
     from the United Kingdom.  The number of deaths was in fact very small.

  7. The Adjudicator also concluded that the Appellant had  exaggerated  in
     his claim to have a personal relationship with General Guei  and  said
     that it was clear that he was not specifically regarded as a spokesman
     for General Guei.  A musical partner of his, Mr  Alan  Bill,  had  not
     faced any problems.  She was also very critical of the evidence  given
     by the Appellant's wife which, she concluded, was untrue in  a  number
     of respects. She pointed to a considerable  number  of  contradictions
     between what the wife said and what the  Appellant  had  said  in  his
     evidence.  She also took the view  that  the  Appellant's  immigration
     history was damaging to his credibility.  She  pointed  out  that  the
     Appellant did not seek to rely on Article 8 and given  the  fact  that
     the wife had no right to be in the United  Kingdom  and  could  return
     with the Appellant and their children  to  the  C�te  d'Ivoire,  there
     would have been no merit in pursuing such a claim.

  8. The Adjudicator finally concluded, in paragraph 124, as follows:


           "The Article 3 claim relies on the  same  facts  as  the  asylum
           claim and therefore my findings  apply  equally  to  both.   The
           appellant is clearly a talented musician  however  the  evidence
           does not support his claim that he would be at  risk  on  return
           because of the political content of his songs.  Based on all the
           evidence before me I find that there is no reasonable degree  of
           likelihood that the appellant would face persecution or breaches
           of his human rights were he to return to C�te d'Ivoire."


  8. Before the  Tribunal,  Mr  Morgan,  who  appeared  on  behalf  of  the
     Appellant, took four points.  He contended that  the  Adjudicator  had
     wrongly refused an  application  for  an  adjournment  in  order  that
     particular evidence be examined.  He submitted  that  the  Adjudicator
     had intervened excessively, both  in  the  course  of  the  giving  of
     evidence and in the course of the submissions  of  Mr  Bobb,  who  was
     appearing then for the Appellant.  His final point raised a series  of
     criticisms of the conclusions which the  Adjudicator  had  drawn.   He
     highlighted two points in particular:  the way in which, he said,  the
     Adjudicator had unfairly allowed her view of the  wife's  credibility,
     who had acknowledged that she had given  untruthful  evidence  to  the
     Adjudicator, to affect her view of the Appellant's credibility and the
     failure of the Adjudicator to appreciate the simple point  that  there
     was no reason for the Appellant, a successful C�te  d'Ivoire  musician
     to leave his country unless he were at risk of persecution.

Removal from the Fast Track

  9. Mr Morgan, however, made a preliminary application for the removal  of
     this case from the fast track procedure.  He complained that this  was
     not a normal fast track case.  It did not come from one of the top  35
     asylum-seeker countries, nor was it a white-list country.   The  claim
     was not on its face unbelievable.   The  Appellant  had  been  in  the
     United Kingdom for some time and others were involved in his case.  He
     had been in ordinary immigration detention for a number of days before
     he was transferred to Harmondsworth, a transfer which was a  necessary
     pre-condition to the operation of the fast track.  Mr Morgan submitted
     that the effect of the inappropriate inclusion of this case within the
     fast track was that corners were cut.  The Adjudicator had refused  an
     adjournment when it should have been  granted  because  of  a  problem
     created by the late return by the Home Office of a video which Mr Bobb
     had sought to introduce.  The hearing had led  to  antagonism  between
     him and the Adjudicator because of the time pressures which fast track
     procedures impose.  He had also been taken by surprise by  discovering
     that the Appellant's wife was not telling the truth in  her  statement
     or would not be telling the truth  in  her  evidence  because  of  the
     shortness of time which he had had to  read  the  Home  Office  bundle
     which showed, contrary to what the Appellant and his wife  said,  that
     she had  already  been  refused  asylum  and  had  made  a  number  of
     contradictory statements.

 10. We rejected this application.  Rule 23(1)(b) of  the  Immigration  and
     Asylum Appeals (fast track Procedure) Rules  2003  provides  that  the
     fast track  should  cease  to  apply  to  an  appeal  "in  exceptional
     circumstances, if the Adjudicator or  the  Tribunal  is  satisfied  by
     evidence filed or given by or on behalf of a  party  that  the  appeal
     cannot otherwise be justly  determined;   ...".   There  had  been  no
     formal application to the Adjudicator for the case to be removed  from
     the fast track and the bail application was not as such the same.   It
     was not suggested that before us this appeal  could  not  properly  be
     dealt with within the fast track.  In any event, the Appellant did not
     really put his case within the confines of Rule  23,  whether  or  not
     saying that the Adjudicator should have removed the case from the fast
     track.   We  deal  separately  with  the  question  of   whether   the
     adjournment sought should have been granted, but conclude  that  there
     was nothing wrong with the Adjudicator's refusal  of  it.   There  was
     nothing unfair in the Home Office bundle revealing that the  wife  had
     had her claim determined.  Although the determination  letter  in  the
     bundle was incompletely copied when initially served in  time,  it  is
     clear that the fact that there had been an Adjudicator's rejection  of
     the  wife's  claim,  one  of  the  critical  points  in  relation   to
     credibility, was apparent from the bundle itself when served.   It  is
     wrong to suppose that the just disposition of an appeal requires it to
     be removed from the fast track simply because  an  Appellant  receives
     less forewarning than he might otherwise receive of the untruthfulness
     of a witness whom he presents as truthful, problematic for his  appeal
     though that may be.

 11. This was not a case either, so far as the effect of the involvement of
     others was concerned, in which in the  end  an  Article  8  point  was
     pursued.  Mr Bobb withdrew any reliance upon Article 8.  There were no
     corners cut in the appeal.  It was a lengthy hearing  over  two  days.
     It can only be said that the lunch hour on one occasion was truncated.
      That does not go anywhere near supporting Mr Morgan's point.   Except
     for the complaint about the  adjournment,  there  is  no  evidence  or
     submissions which have been referred to which the Appellant was unable
     to provide.  There is nothing in the other facts which show  that  the
     appeal, whether to the Adjudicator or to the Tribunal, requires to  be
     removed from the fast track in order for it justly to  be  determined,
     and indeed there are no other circumstances which show that this  case
     should be removed from the fast track.

The adjournment application

 12. The appeal had been adjourned on 22nd December  2003  to  7th  January
     2004 because the Appellant wished to rely upon  the  contents  of  two
     videos which the Home Office had received from him  and  had  not  yet
     returned to him.  The videos  were  not  returned  until  1pm  on  6th
     January 2004 and no transcripts of their contents in English had  been
     provided by the time the  appeal  came  on  for  hearing.   A  written
     application for an adjournment was refused on 5th  January  2004.   Mr
     Morgan  pointed  out  that  it  was  particularly  important  for  the
     Secretary of State to do promptly what he has to do if he is  imposing
     on an Appellant the very tight timetable inherent in  the  fast  track
     procedure.  That is obviously right.  Mr Bobb  sought  an  adjournment
     from the Adjudicator at the outset of the hearing on 7th January  2004
     because he said that he had had insufficient time to prepare his  case
     for a number of reasons.  However, it is only the point in relation to
     the second video which has been pursued before us.  Mr Bobb was  given
     some further time to read the papers which he  had  said  he  had  not
     fully read.

 13. In  relation  to  the  second  video,  the  Adjudicator  said  in  the
     determination that she could not  see  that  the  second  video  would
     advance the Appellant's case because there was no issue as to the fact
     that the Appellant was  a  musician  who  had  been  involved  in  the
     production of El Mutino, had sung at concerts and that his  music  had
     political overtones.  She said that the Appellant  would  be  able  to
     give evidence as to the contents of the second video and indeed he did
     so, saying, as recorded in the determination, that  it  was  concerned
     with the work  and  death  of  Mr  Yace.   The  Adjudicator  said,  in
     paragraph 100, of the determination:

           "I further accept that Mr Yace died of unnatural  causes;   this
           is also accepted by the Secretary of State.  The second video is
           said to be a documentary about Mr Yace's  work  and  his  death,
           although no indication is given as to who  was  responsible  for
           his killing, and Mr Bobb did not seek to rely on this  video  at
           the conclusion of the hearing in spite of his  earlier  repeated
           requests for an adjournment to provide a transcript of it."


 14. Mr Bobb, in his witness statement  for  this  appeal,  said  that  the
     Adjudicator had said that she would view one video  overnight  and  he
     viewed the second one but only saw 30 minutes of it, stopping  because
     he did not understand the African/French, or indeed any French at all.
      The Adjudicator  had  said  to  him  that  he  could  use  the  Court
     Interpreter, and Mr Ouseley (unrelated to the President) told us  that
     there were video viewing facilities available at Hatton Cross.  In his
     witness statement, Mr Bobb said that on the second video the names  of
     Guei and Yace were mentioned and a car was shown riddled  with  bullet
     holes.  At paragraph 11 of his statement, he said  that  he  told  the
     Adjudicator that he would not be relying upon  the  video  because  he
     could not say whose car was shown riddled with bullets or describe how
     the video related to the appeal.  He could  only  say  with  certainty
     that it showed a  picture  of  General  Guei  dead,  a  point  already
     accepted by the Secretary of State.

 15. We do not consider that there is anything in this  ground  of  appeal.
     The question of whether an adjournment should be granted is very  much
     one for the judicial discretion of the Adjudicator, a discretion  with
     which the Immigration Appeal Tribunal should only interfere if it  has
     been exercised on an improper basis or  unfairly.   The  shortness  of
     time available before the appeal for the viewing of the videos created
     by the late return of them to the Appellant by the Secretary of  State
     undoubtedly would have added to the pressure on Mr Bobb.  However, the
     Appellant knew the contents of the second  video  and  could  describe
     them to Mr Bobb.  He could explain the significance of their  contents
     for his case.  He could and did give evidence about  the  contents  to
     the  Adjudicator.   They  related  to  matters  which  were   not   in
     contention.  Their main point, according to the Appellant, was to show
     the death of Mr Yace with whom the Appellant was  connected.   Neither
     the death nor the connection were at issue.  Mr Bobb said they  showed
     the death of General Guei, which was not at issue either. It was  open
     to Mr Bobb to seek the assistance of the Court Interpreter,  there  to
     interpret for the Appellant and other witnesses, in understanding what
     the video was about through  the  use,  if  necessary,  of  facilities
     available at the hearing centre.  Mr Bobb actively  withdrew  reliance
     upon the second video.

 16. Crucially, even now with the passage of time since  the  dismissal  of
     the appeal, there has been no transcript provided  or  description  of
     the contents of the second video.  It is not suggested that there  was
     any point, let alone a point  of  significance,  contained  within  it
     which would have advanced the Appellant's case, which the  refusal  of
     the adjournment prevented being placed  before  the  Adjudicator.   No
     such point has been identified or evidenced.

 17. We should add briefly in relation to the other points  upon  which  Mr
     Bobb had sought an adjournment, that  Mr  Bobb's  firm  knew,  on  3rd
     December 2003, that the case was a fast track case  and  Mr  Bobb  was
     given some further time to read documents which he had said he had not
     had sufficient time to read, notably the full version  of  the  asylum
     determination in respect of the Appellant's wife.  Mr  Bobb  did  not,
     and indeed could not, put his application for an  adjournment  on  the
     basis that the untruthfulness of the wife's evidence, as was  becoming
     apparent, put him in tactical difficulties which  he  needed  time  to
     resolve.

Conduct of the appeal:  evidence and submissions

 18.  Mr  Bobb's  first  complaint  relates  to  interventions  during  the
     Appellant's evidence.  There were no interventions during evidence-in-
     chief, but Mr Bobb refers to 12 interventions  which  occurred  during
     the course of cross-examination by the Home Office Presenting Officer.
      However, Mr Bobb took no objection to  those  questions  and  in  his
     witness statement says that the questions followed naturally from  the
     questions asked and  answers  given  to  the  Home  Office  Presenting
     Officer.  Nonetheless, Mr Bobb says that he thought  it  was  improper
     for the Adjudicator to put those questions.  He clearly  had  in  mind
     that he thought it was for the Home Office Presenting Officer alone to
     put those questions.  He makes no complaint about two questions  asked
     in the course of his re-examination of  the  Appellant,  but  he  then
     asked if he could ask further questions  in  chief  of  the  Appellant
     which he had forgotten to put.  He was allowed to  put  them  but  his
     chief complaint in relation to the evidence of the  Appellant  relates
     to the questions which the Adjudicator put  after  the  conclusion  of
     this second round of questions.

 19. He does not and cannot take objection to the fact that, at this  stage
     in  the  proceedings,  the  Adjudicator  asked  questions.   He  says,
     however, that he objected twice to  the  questions  which  were  being
     asked.  This was because he said the Adjudicator asked no  fewer  than
     17 questions.  He objected, saying that it was for the Home Office  to
     present its case and that the Tribunal did not allow an Adjudicator to
     usurp the Home Office's position.  The Adjudicator  responded  to  the
     effect that she was well aware of her duties.

 20. Mr Bobb provided a transcript of those questions  and  answers.   They
     cover some seven or eight  topics,  although  a  number  of  them  are
     related.  They deal with such matters as why the Appellant's name  and
     his son's name were not on the son's birth  certificate  and  somebody
     else's was, with the time that he had spent in the United Kingdom  and
     a number of matters which his wife had  said  in  the  course  of  her
     appeal, and other matters.  The  questions  are  short  and  neutrally
     phrased.  Mr Bobb complains that they read  like  a  cross-examination
     rather than clarification.

 21. Mr Bobb's second complaint relates to the evidence of Mr Assagou.   He
     had been trying to get Mr Assagou to explain how long  someone  called
     Leopold had lived with the Appellant and the  Appellant's  wife.   The
     witness's memory or willingness to answer was  plainly  somewhat  less
     than Mr Bobb had hoped.  After a number of questions, Mr Bobb was able
     to bring the witness to say that the last time he had seen Leopold  at
     the house was around the beginning of 2003.  He  then  turned  to  ask
     what the first time he had seen him there was.  The  witness  answered
     that it was difficult to remember, between  2001  and  2002.   He  was
     pressed as to which year, but answered that it was  difficult  because
     he had not realised that he would be asked questions about his  living
     there at that time.

 22. Mr Bobb complains that the Adjudicator intervened here and  asked  him
     to move on with his questioning because the witness clearly could  not
     answer the question.  Mr Bobb had hoped that further questioning might
     achieve some jogging of the memory as to the first time  he  had  seen
     them in the way that his questions had achieved some  jogging  of  the
     memory in relation to the last time that he had seen  Leopold  at  the
     house.  The purpose of these  questions  was  to  establish  that  the
     husband's evidence in relation to this  was  more  reliable  than  the
     wife's.

 23. He complains that the intervention was unfair and  was  compounded  by
     the leeway given to the Home Office Presenting Officer when asking his
     questions in cross-examination.  The Home  Office  Presenting  Officer
     had been asking about when Mr  Assagou  had  gone  back  to  the  C�te
     d'Ivoire after his arrival in 1994 in the United Kingdom.  He had said
     that he had gone back but did not know when the  last  time  was.   Mr
     Bobb objected as the Home Office Presenting Officer sought  to  pursue
     the question, but his objection was overruled.  The  questioning  then
     continued with a question about whether the witness had been  back  to
     the C�te d'Ivoire.  The answer was "What has this got to do with being
     here this morning?"  The witness  was  asked  by  the  Adjudicator  to
     answer the question.  The question was again put, asking  the  witness
     to say when the last time was that  he  had  been  back  to  the  C�te
     d'Ivoire to which the witness again replied that he did not know  what
     this had to do with the case.   Mr  Bobb  says  that  the  Adjudicator
     should have asked the  Home  Office  Presenting  Officer  to  move  on
     because the witness could not answer  questions.   He  had  apparently
     pursued the line of questioning further.

 24. The third point in relation to the evidence is one which Mr Bobb  does
     not press.  He recognises that his invitation to  another  witness  to
     hazard a guess about  how  long  Leopold  had  been  living  with  the
     Appellant and his wife was possibly an inappropriate question, but  he
     complained  that  the  Adjudicator  told  him,  in  response  to  that
     question, that any answer would be worthless.  He did not  pursue  the
     point.

 25. Mr Bobb made two complaints essentially  about  interventions  in  the
     course of summing up.  He said that  when  the  Appellant's  wife  was
     giving evidence and had made several statements directly contradicting
     the evidence of the Appellant, he had established that she had lied to
     the Appellant's representatives, to the Appellant, to  the  Respondent
     and also lied at the present appeal before the Adjudicator.   Mr  Bobb
     says that he then sought permission from the Adjudicator to treat  the
     wife as a hostile witness.  He  said  that  he  had  previously  taken
     instructions from the Appellant on this matter  and  his  instructions
     were to do just that.  The Adjudicator asked why she had  been  called
     if Mr Bobb wanted to treat her as hostile, to which he replied that it
     was necessary for him to establish that she was lying before he  could
     treat her as hostile.  He says that the Adjudicator then said that  he
     could proceed on that basis, and he did indeed accuse the  Appellant's
     wife of lying.

 26. When it came to submissions, and he referred  to  the  fact  that  the
     Adjudicator had given  him  permission  to  treat  her  as  a  hostile
     witness, the Adjudicator said that  there  was  no  provision  in  the
     Procedure  Rules  for  treating  a  witness  as  a  hostile   witness.
     Nonetheless, she continued to let him make his submissions as  to  the
     reliability of the wife and as to the effect of her evidence upon  the
     Appellant's credibility.

 27. Mr Bobb's more substantial point in relation to  the  submissions  was
     that there were no interventions during the course of the Home  Office
     Presenting Officer's submissions but that there were many  during  the
     course of his, so many that his submissions became disconnected and he
     felt harried.  The Adjudicator, as he  described  it,  was  constantly
     intervening to ask him  to  refer  to  the  passages  in  the  country
     evidence which  showed  that  followers  of  the  General  were  being
     persecuted.  He said that he had tried to make a submission  that  the
     country evidence was circumstantial and that  a  reasonable  inference
     could be drawn from it, but he says he felt that in the end he had  to
     abandon making his submissions.  His complaint about the interventions
     is confined to those two points and not the other areas which he dealt
     with in his submissions.

 28. The statement of Mr Bobb raises a number of matters where it is  clear
     that the impression he gained was that he had irritated and aggravated
     the Adjudicator on a number of occasions.  These included his  seeking
     an  adjournment,  his  seeking  of  time  to  examine  documents,  her
     interventions and his objections, his asking to  cross-examination  in
     chief further the Appellant and the reference in the  decision  letter
     to his being late.

 29. He said that he could not recollect being late, because if he were  he
     always apologised.  He was surprised that  comment  was  made  in  the
     determination  on  that  point.   He  was  also  concerned  that   the
     Adjudicator was then displeased with the fact that evidence  had  been
     served late and with a translation only in part.

 30. Mr  Beer,  the  Home  Office  Presenting  Officer,  produced  a  short
     statement in which he expressed the view that  the  interventions  had
     not been excessive, that issues had  not  been  prevented  from  being
     raised and that in the course of the more than seven hour hearing,  Mr
     Bobb had spent an inordinate amount of time on irrelevant  issues  and
     had simply been moved on.

 31. It was suggested in submission and in the grounds of appeal  that  the
     intervention in the cross-examination and more so the questions  asked
     of the Appellant by  the  Adjudicator  after  the  conclusion  of  re-
     examination, tended  to  support  the  lines  which  the  Home  Office
     Presenting Officer was pursuing and that that was a breach of  natural
     justice.  It was  suggested  that  the  appropriate  approach  for  an
     Adjudicator was that he should not enter the arena, save to the extent
     absolutely necessary to ascertain the truth, and must  not  appear  to
     adopt a hostile attitude to any witness.

 32. Mr Morgan referred to Oyono [2002] UKIAT  2034  in  which  the  Deputy
     President said:

           "When evidence is being taken from a witness and where there  is
           representation on both sides, an Adjudicator's role is of silent
           listening.  It may very occasionally happen that an  Adjudicator
           is so unclear as to what he has heard that he needs to  ask  for
           something to be repeated and, of course, there may  occasionally
           be difficulties  with  interpreters  causing  the  Adjudicator's
           general control over the proceedings to come into play.  But  it
           is for the parties to bring out evidence in the order they think
           appropriate  and  it  is  for  the  parties  to   put   whatever
           contradictions in the evidence need to be put  to  the  witness.
           When the evidence has been finished, in the sense that there has
           been  examination-in-chief   and   cross-examination   and   re-
           examination, it may  be  that  the  Adjudicator  wishes  to  put
           matters arising out of the evidence to  the  witness:   but  the
           time for that is after re-examination.  If the Adjudicator  does
           ask the witness any questions,  he  must  then  always  give  an
           opportunity to the parties to ask any  further  questions  which
           arise from his.  An Adjudicator who intervenes during the course
           of evidence is running the risk that  he  will  be  seen  to  be
           taking the side of one party or the other."


 33.  Mr  Morgan  submitted  that  the   Adjudicator   had,   through   her
     interventions, usurped the position  of  the  Home  Office  Presenting
     Officer.  She had confused the role which sometimes has to be  adopted
     where there is no Home Office Presenting  Officer  with  the  position
     where a Home Office Presenting  Officer  is  present.   The  Surendran
     guidelines had no application in these circumstances.   There  was  no
     obligation on the Adjudicator to put to the Appellant what was set out
     in  the  refusal  letter.   During  submissions,   Adjudicators   were
     habitually inactive, taking a record of the submissions only.  He said
     that the pressure brought about by the fast track and, in  particular,
     a long fast  track  case,  were  to  blame.   Mr  Bobb  had  3�  years
     experience appearing before Adjudicators  and  the  Tribunal  and  had
     experienced no  such  similar  case.   It  was  unfortunate  that  the
     Adjudicator and Mr Bobb got off on the wrong foot, but the upshot  had
     been an unfair hearing.

 34. The Adjudicator refers on a number of occasions in  the  determination
     to these matters.  In paragraph 54 on, the Adjudicator refers  to  her
     having "asked a few  questions  to  clarify  matters  arising  in  the
     appellant's evidence" after the  conclusion  of  re-examination.   She
     asked whether the Appellant had the originals of the articles  he  had
     submitted which he said were with the  immigration  authorities.   She
     then asked why he thought his name did not appear on his  son's  birth
     certificate.  Paragraph 56 of the determination continues:

           "I asked why he thought his name did not  appear  on  his  son's
           birth certificate.  Before the appellant could give  an  answer,
           Mr Bobb interrupted and objected to my question.  He  maintained
           this was a matter which should have been put by the Home  Office
           Presenting Officer.  I pointed out to Mr Bobb that  this  was  a
           matter raised in the Reasons for Refusal Letter and that  I  was
           affording the appellant an opportunity to try  and  resolve  it.
           The appellant then replied.  He said that he did  not  know  why
           his wife had done this and that his name did not even appear  on
           Ashley's birth certificate."

 35. She then sets out the other questions which she asked in a  way  which
     is entirely consistent with the way in which  Mr  Bobb  describes  the
     questions.  At paragraph 60, she says this:

           "I asked the appellant when he completed his studies.   He  said
           he thought it was 1994 or 1995 but he then  said  that  when  he
           married in January 1995 he had been in his final year.  I  asked
           why he had claimed  at  his  screening  interview  that  he  had
           completed his education in 1989.  Mr Bobb once again intervened,
           maintaining that I was intervening in a way  prohibited  by  the
           Tribunal.  I did not agree with Mr Bobb and pointed out that  it
           was far fairer to allow the appellant an opportunity to  explain
           matters that concerned me in his evidence.  The  appellant  said
           that he had told the  interviewing  officer  something  was  not
           right with the information he had provided but the  officer  had
           told him they would look at it later on."

 36. After one more question,  the  Adjudicator  records,  and  it  is  not
     disputed, that Mr Beer was given  the  opportunity  to  ask  questions
     arising but he had none, and that Mr Bobb asked one  question  out  of
     matters which the Adjudicator had raised.

 37. The Adjudicator describes the stages through which the wife's evidence
     went, that Mr Bobb wished to treat her as hostile and that  after  the
     witness had given evidence that she had lied on a number of occasions,
     had said that he did not rely on anything she said and  would  not  be
     pursuing any Article 8 case.

 38. She points out in paragraph 79 that Mr Bobb  had  failed  to  ask  the
     witness Mr Assagou whether  he  was  aware  of  the  contents  of  his
     statement, whether it was his signature and whether he  was  happy  to
     rely on  it:   a  matter  which  she  records.   She  deals  with  the
     intervention by Mr Bobb during the cross-examination of Mr Assagou  in
     paragraph 80.  He had been asked again whether he had returned to  the
     C�te d'Ivoire since 1994, which was the first question, and then since
     2000, which was the second question. Paragraph 80 continues:

           "Once again the witness replied 'What has this got  to  do  with
           anything'.  I asked him  whether  he  was  able  to  answer  the
           question or not and Mr Bobb interrupted to object.  I  asked  Mr
           Bobb to allow Mr Beer to continue his cross-examination and  the
           witness was asked again whether he was able to give an answer to
           the question put to him.  His answer once  more  was  'What  has
           this got to do with anything'.  It was explained to him that  he
           had given a lot of information about his country in evidence and
           that it would be helpful to know when he was  last  there.   The
           witness once more replied that he did not know what that had got
           to do with his evidence."

 39. In paragraph 84, she deals with the evidence of the  witness  whom  Mr
     Bobb asked to speculate.

           "She stated that she knew  the  appellant's  wife  from  Abidjan
           before she came here 11 years ago that they did  not  know  each
           other well.  She stated that whilst in the UK the appellant  had
           lived with his wife however it was their custom to put  up  many
           people one of whom was Mr Mandjoba whom she saw once and did not
           know.  She was unable to state how long he had lived there  that
           she did not go there very often.  Mr Bobb asked her to hazard  a
           guess at which point I intervened  indicating  that  any  answer
           given to that question would be  worthless.   The  witness  said
           that she knew Mr Mandjoba was now in Paris that she did not know
           when he had gone back there."


 40. In paragraph 85, she refers to the partially translated  document  and
     her indication to Mr Bobb that  it  would  have  limited  weight,  but
     nonetheless she had agreed to accept  it.   Next,  she  refers  to  an
     inconsistency which Mr Bobb had not noticed  between  the  Appellant's
     evidence and a music review which he had submitted,  an  inconsistency
     that was resolved by Mr Beer noticing an error in translation  by  the
     interpreter.  In paragraph 91, she says that she asked Mr Bobb whether
     he wished to rely in any way on the second video which  the  Appellant
     had produced, but he replied that he did not.

 41. Although Mr Morgan puts his case  on  the  basis  that  the  issue  is
     whether or not the hearing had been fair, we have also  considered  it
     appropriate to ask ourselves whether there was any  apparent  bias  in
     this case.  The test  for  that  is  whether  the  circumstances  when
     ascertained  would  lead  to  a  fair-minded  and  informed   observer
     concluding that there was a real possibility or real danger  that  the
     Adjudicator was biased; Porter v Magill [2002] 2 WLR 37.

 42. There is a danger that the comments  relied  on  in  Oyono  have  been
     misunderstood.  An Adjudicator or any  judge  is  of  course  entitled
     during evidence-in-chief to seek clarification of an  answer,  whether
     because it has not been heard properly or  understood  or  interpreted
     properly.  He is entitled to check that he  has  recorded  the  answer
     correctly.  But that is not the limit on  his  powers  or  indeed  his
     obligations  of  intervention  during  the  giving  of  evidence.   An
     Adjudicator also has obligations in relation to the general control of
     a  case.   It  is  proper  for  an  Adjudicator  to  intervene  during
     examination-in-chief and cross-examination for the purposes of  moving
     the proceedings along, so long as that is done in a fair  manner.   It
     is necessary and proper for an Adjudicator to point out that a line of
     questioning is irrelevant or valueless  or  repetitious  or  is  going
     nowhere.  It will, of course, be necessary to  consider  any  response
     made by a representative to such an approach.  But what  was  said  by
     the Deputy President in Oyono assumes that the questions being put are
     relevant and are not being pursued at undue length.   Even  where  the
     parties are both represented, it is still relevant for questions to be
     put by the Adjudicator to  a  witness  if  they  raise  matters  which
     trouble the Adjudicator if they have not been raised or dealt with  by
     the opposing advocate.  This is especially so if  the  Adjudicator  is
     concerned by the point and  it  is  something  which  may  affect  the
     decision or indeed should affect the decision, but cannot fairly do so
     without the relevant witness being given the opportunity to deal  with
     it.  The comments made in this respect by the Adjudicator in paragraph
     60 are entirely right.

 43. Of course, what is said in Oyono in relation to the timing at which an
     Adjudicator should put  questions  for  that  purpose  is  right.   An
     Adjudicator ought not  to  interrupt  examination-in-chief  or  cross-
     examination except in the circumstances to which we have  referred  or
     for other reasons associated with the general control of the case  and
     the court room.  If there are inconsistencies  between  documents  and
     oral evidence or between answers which have been given already, it  is
     nearly always best to  wait  until  after  cross-examination  and  re-
     examination to see what  matters  are  put.   However,  it  is  wholly
     legitimate for the Adjudicator to ask his  or  her  own  questions  on
     issues of inconsistency,  points  raised  in  the  refusal  letter  or
     matters which trouble the Adjudicator whether or not they  are  raised
     by the other party.  What is important, however, in relation to  those
     matters is that the Adjudicator should not develop  a  different  case
     from that being presented by the other party or pursue his or her  own
     theory of the case.

 44. The manner in which any intervention is undertaken is also  important.
     It should not be done in any hostile  manner  or  in  a  manner  which
     suggests that the Adjudicator's mind  has  been  made  up.   Questions
     should not be leading questions or ones which conceal the purpose  for
     which they are asked, but instead  should  be  direct  and  open-ended
     questions.  It is perfectly proper for the Adjudicator to  ask,  after
     questions have been put in cross-examination  and  re-examination  has
     taken place, why a witness has said x when  earlier  that  or  another
     witness has said y, or how document x can be reconciled with  document
     or oral evidence y.  An Adjudicator is entitled to follow the  logical
     train of answers to see how they fit with the case if that is regarded
     as potentially significant for an issue  in  the  case.   It  is  also
     important, however,  that  an  Adjudicator  should  keep  a  sense  of
     proportion about the questions which he or she asks.  It  is  not  for
     the Adjudicator to take over conduct of the case either by the  number
     of questions asked or the development of his or her own theories.  The
     interventions may or may not assist one or other party.  They are  not
     unfair merely because one or other party may  derive  assistance  from
     them.

 45. As to submissions, it is quite wrong  to  suppose  that  there  is  an
     obligation on an Adjudicator merely to keep silent during submissions,
     noting them down regardless of whether they are  words  of  wisdom  or
     irrelevancies, failing to deal  with  the  points  which  trouble  the
     Adjudicator.  An Adjudicator is entitled also to intervene  to  ensure
     that an advocate responds, if he is not otherwise doing so, to  points
     which his opponent has made.  There is no reason  for  the  number  of
     questions to be asked of one side to equal  the  number  of  questions
     asked of another.  The degree of  intervention  will  depend  entirely
     upon  the  focus  and  relevance  of  the  submissions  made;    their
     helpfulness and their succinctness.  It is  perfectly  proper  for  an
     Adjudicator  to  move  submissions  on  by  indicating  that  she  has
     understood the point or to prevent the irrelevant in order to try  and
     obtain  the  relevant  answers  for  the  purposes  of   writing   the
     determination.  Much will depend upon the nature of the case  and  the
     style of the advocates and Adjudicator.   It  is  important,  however,
     that the Adjudicator  does  not  intervene  to  such  an  extent  that
     relevant submissions are disrupted and relevant points  are  prevented
     from  being  made.   In  that  way,  the  Adjudicator  would  fail  to
     understand the case and potentially would miss important points  being
     made to her.

 46. With those points in mind, we turn to examine the specific  complaints
     made by Mr  Morgan.   So  far  as  the  Appellant's  own  witness  was
     concerned, the intervention complained of did not take  place  in  the
     course of evidence-in-chief and no objection was raised in respect  of
     the intervention in cross-examination at the time.  It is acknowledged
     that the questions flowed naturally from  the  questions  and  answers
     given.  No detail is provided as to  their  nature.   Accordingly,  we
     regard that part of the complaint as a minor point which  is  entirely
     unevidenced and misconceived in principle.

 47. The real complaint in relation to the  Appellant's  evidence  concerns
     the questions which were asked by the Adjudicator after the conclusion
     of re-examination.  The questions and answers, both in her language as
     set out in the determination and in Mr Bobb's witness  evidence,  show
     nothing in terms of their style to controvert any  of  the  principles
     which we have set out.  They properly raise legitimate questions, some
     of clarification, some of inconsistency or obvious concern.  It  would
     have been arguably remiss for the Adjudicator to reach conclusions  in
     relation to those matters without giving the Appellant an  opportunity
     to deal with the concerns  which  she  had.   They  were  not  leading
     questions, nor did they conceal, in  the  way  in  which  an  advocate
     legitimately might, the ultimate target to which  the  questions  were
     working.  There has been no suggestion of anything in the  tone  which
     indicated hostility or a mind made  up.   If  the  questions  were  of
     assistance to one side rather  than  to  another,  that  reflects  the
     weakness  of  the  case  and  cannot  impose  an  obligation  on   the
     Adjudicator not to ask the questions.   They  were  not  over-long  in
     number, or disproportionate to the issues;  they did not  involve  the
     Adjudicator going off on some misguided frolic of her own.

 48. It is  suggested  that  there  was  a  wrongful  intervention  in  the
     questioning  of  Mr  Assagou  in  chief.    From   the   Adjudicator's
     determination and from Mr Bobb's list of  the  questions  and  answers
     which were given, it was, in our judgment, a reasonable point for  the
     Adjudicator to intervene and ask Mr Bobb to move on.  It was perfectly
     clear that the witness had no recollection that could be refined  more
     greatly than he had done already.  He had  been  able  to  refine  the
     timing of the last visit, but had twice said, already having  revealed
     a poor memory, that he was unable to assist on the time when he  first
     went to C�te d'Ivoire beyond referring to the two  year  period.   The
     Adjudicator had already had the advantage of seeing the way  in  which
     the witness gave evidence in relation to time and her intervention was
     not one which, in our judgment, can properly be criticised.

 49. It is then said that the same point ought to have been  taken  by  the
     Adjudicator  against  the  Home  Office  Presenting  Officer's  cross-
     examination of this witness in relation to when he had  gone  back  to
     the C�te d'Ivoire.  This was a point at which Mr Bobb  had  intervened
     to object to the fact that the  Home  Office  Presenting  Officer  was
     allowed to continue questioning.  It is important for the distinctions
     between cross-examination and evidence-in-chief to be remembered.   In
     evidence-in-chief, the function of  the  advocate  is  to  elicit  the
     relevant information upon which he relies.  In cross-examination,  one
     task of the advocate is to show how unreliable a witness is by showing
     how much he has  forgotten  and  how  little  able  he  is  to  answer
     questions.  The criticism is without sound foundation.

 50. The Adjudicator was quite right to point out that there was  no  point
     in inviting the next witness to guess at  something,  as  Mr  Bobb  in
     effect recognises, and it is proper for the Adjudicator to say that an
     invitation to guess produces an answer  to  which  no  weight  can  be
     given.

 51. The complaints in  relation  to  the  submissions  are  entirely  ill-
     founded.  The Adjudicator is right to  point  out  that  there  is  no
     procedure for treating a witness as hostile as such, but it  is  quite
     clear that she also accepted that Mr Bobb could  ask  the  Appellant's
     wife questions which sought to establish not the truthfulness of  what
     she had to say, but her unreliability.  To our mind, her  intervention
     in the submissions did not alter the substance of the point.  She  had
     allowed him to present his case in the way in which  he  wanted;   the
     Adjudicator was not preventing a submission being made that  the  wife
     was an unreliable witness.  Indeed, the Adjudicator reaches that  very
     conclusion herself.  The Adjudicator was taking what might  have  been
     regarded as a precise, perhaps over-precise point, in relation to  the
     rules.

 52. The more general point made in relation to the submissions is likewise
     ill-founded.  It was perfectly proper for the Adjudicator to endeavour
     to focus Mr Bobb on the relevant parts  of  the  background  evidence.
     What the Adjudicator was looking for was material which supported  the
     contention that someone who had the relationship with and support  for
     General Guei, which she found the Appellant had, would be at  risk  of
     persecution on return.  She was not concerned at that stage with  more
     general points about difficulties in C�te  d'Ivoire  which  would  not
     affect the Appellant, whether because of the location in  which  those
     troubles were occurring or for any other reason.  It is  difficult  as
     well to see that her interventions prevented her getting hold  of  the
     points which the Appellant wished to make through Mr Bobb.

 53. It is plain that the Adjudicator was right to conclude that there  was
     nothing which showed that the asserted association with  General  Guei
     or Mr Yace would put the Appellant at any risk of persecution or  ill-
     treatment on his return.  Before us, when we pressed  Mr  Morgan  with
     the same point, he made it clear that there was no such material.  He,
     like Mr Bobb, was relying upon more general, and  as  the  Adjudicator
     found in substance, irrelevant material.  It is for  the  purposes  of
     these submissions irrelevant that the Home Office  Presenting  Officer
     was not interrupted in the course of  his  submissions.   There  would
     have been little point in doing  so  if  the  Home  Office  Presenting
     Officer's submissions directed themselves succinctly to  the  relevant
     points.   The  Adjudicator  properly  considered  all  the   objective
     evidence in relation to C�te d'Ivoire and reached  proper  conclusions
     in  relation  to  it,  conclusions  which  are  consistent  with   the
     Tribunal's approach to the problems in that country.

 54. We recognise that where allegations of unfairness are made, they  have
     to be looked  at  as  a  whole  and  one  cannot  exclude  from  one's
     consideration  of  them  the  sort  of  incidents  which,   minor   in
     themselves, may indicate that there was hostility towards an  advocate
     or to a party which precluded a fair hearing being or  seeming  to  be
     fair.  There are a  number  of  comments  in  the  determination,  for
     example about Mr Bobb's late arrival and about the late production  of
     partially  translated  documents,  which  suggest  that  Mr  Bobb  had
     irritated the Adjudicator.  It is also plain from  Mr  Bobb's  witness
     statement that the Adjudicator did not take  kindly  to  some  of  his
     interventions,  thinking,  perhaps  rightly  in  the  light   of   the
     submissions made, that he was telling her that she did not know how to
     do her job.  It is possible that there  was  some  irritation  between
     them at an early stage, arising out of her refusal of  an  adjournment
     and her manifest belief that he could cope with  the  material  within
     the timeframe she allowed.  Whether or not a different approach  would
     have been adopted in relation  to  a  non-fast  track  appeal,  it  is
     impossible to say.

 55. However, viewing the hearing as a whole, and having regard to the  way
     the questions have been put, the  nature  of  the  questions  and  the
     circumstances, we do not consider that there  is  any  just  criticism
     which can be made of the Adjudicator.  We do  not  consider  that  her
     interventions were of a nature or manner so as to render  the  hearing
     unfair.  She plainly has understood the points which were  being  made
     and she has dealt with them carefully in a  considered  determination.
     We do not consider that a fair-minded observer, in possession  of  all
     the information, would have concluded that there was a real risk  that
     she was biased.  It is important that  a  fair-minded  observer  would
     have been able to distinguish between an Adjudicator firmly in control
     of a case behaving fairly and properly in order to ascertain  how  the
     case related to the available evidence and somebody who is  indicating
     hostility towards a party or predetermination through the  timing  and
     manner of intervention.   Regrettable  occasional  irritation  between
     judge and advocate does not suffice for a case of apparent bias.

Errors of fact

 56. The grounds of appeal contain a large number of points, in respect  of
     which it is said that the Adjudicator has misunderstood  the  evidence
     or has given inadequate reasons for  the  conclusions  which  she  has
     reached or has been in some way or other illogical in her conclusions.
      Essentially, these are a large number of lesser points which  involve
     taking issue with findings of fact or conclusions of  the  Adjudicator
     which have had to be put into the conventional public  law  framework.
     Mr Morgan recognised the difficulties which he faced  in  relation  to
     all of those at the outset of his submissions.  Indeed, he volunteered
     the difficulties.  Leave had been given to argue them in view  of  the
     more serious allegations which the grounds of appeal raised,  so  that
     the whole of that issue could be seen in the context of  its  possible
     impact on the case.  However, in view of the conclusions which we have
     reached in relation to the fairness of the hearing, and in view of the
     lack of any  real  relationship  between  those  allegations  and  any
     conclusion reached on the substance of the appeal, we propose to  deal
     briefly with these points.

 57. One theme of a number of those points was  that  the  Adjudicator  had
     allowed her view of the wife's credibility adversely and  unfairly  to
     colour her view of the Appellant's credibility on a number of matters.
      The Adjudicator said, in paragraph 111:

           "The  evidence  given  by  the  witnesses  do  not  advance  the
           appellant's  claim  whatsoever  indeed   his   wife's   evidence
           contradicts large  parts  of  what  the  appellant  himself  has
           claimed.  I was asked to disregard her as a hostile witness  but
           the fact remains that  she  was  called  as  a  witness  by  the
           appellant's representative, her oral and documentary evidence is
           before me and it is my duty to assess it and to consider  it  in
           the context of the appellant's claim."


      The Adjudicator said that the wife had made no mention  whatsoever  of
      the Appellant's music in her application or  appeal  which  astonished
      the Adjudicator given that, by the time of her appeal, the Appellant's
      music had allegedly been banned and he  had  gone  into  hiding.   She
      claimed that she had had no information about her  husband  since  she
      left, whereas he claimed to have been in regular  touch  with  her  in
      2000 and 2001, which would have meant that she would indeed have  been
      well aware of  his  problems  if  he  had  genuinely  had  them.   The
      Adjudicator concludes that that clearly suggests  that  the  Appellant
      has embellished his claim in an attempt to claim asylum in the  United
      Kingdom.  There was no reason why, in order to advance her claim,  the
      Appellant's wife should not  have  referred  to  those  matters,  even
      though her real point in her appeal appears to have been  a  different
      one.


 58. The Adjudicator specifically concludes that she is prepared to  accept
     that the Appellant  is  the  biological  father  of  the  two  further
     children which his wife has had in the United Kingdom,  but  concluded
     that  Mr  Mandjoba  had  been  named  as  the  father  on  the   birth
     certificate:

            "... in a deliberate attempt to mislead the Home Office and  to
           strengthen the Appellant's wife's application to remain here  on
           the basis of her relationship to a French national.   I  do  not
           accept that the Appellant was unaware of this and I find that he
           was a party to this deception.  However, as this has  no  direct
           bearing on the asylum claim, I take this matter no further.   Ms
           Ehouman's admission that she never had a  relationship  with  Mr
           Mandjoba and that this was a fabrication  solely  to  facilitate
           the human rights application is no doubt a matter the  Secretary
           of State will take into account when considering whether or  not
           to remove her."


      The Adjudicator then concluded that she did not accept that  the  wife
      had been raped or that the Appellant and his wife had been invited  to
      a campus meeting at the university in April 2000.   She  explains  her
      reasons for that conclusion.


 59. The Adjudicator's task was to appraise all the evidence and it was for
     her to reach a  conclusion  as  to  the  significance  of  the  wife's
     evidence, including its lies and contradictions, for  the  Appellant's
     case.  She was entitled to consider that the calling of a  witness  to
     give evidence which then contradicted the Appellant's  evidence  could
     not be regarded as a matter which simply went to  the  credibility  of
     the wife, and upon the wife's  evidence  being  regarded  as  in  part
     untruthful could simply  be  disregarded  in  the  assessment  of  the
     Appellant's.  It was not simply for the Adjudicator to  say  that  the
     Appellant's wife was a liar in a number of respects and therefore  she
     would focus only on what the husband had said.   The  Adjudicator  was
     entitled to look at contradictions between  the  wife's  evidence  and
     his, and that she mentioned in her appeal no problems which  he  might
     have faced.  The Adjudicator was entitled conclude that this suggested
     that the Appellant had embellished his claim.   She  was  entitled  to
     take into account that he was a party to the deception as to  who  was
     the father of his son, in order to assist his  wife's  claim  and  the
     conflicting evidence given by the wife and the Appellant as  to  where
     they were living  in  April  2000.   They  are  all  relevant  to  the
     reliability of the Appellant.

 60. But, in any event, the Adjudicator is perfectly clear that  there  are
     many pieces of evidence given by the  Appellant  which  she  does  not
     accept for reasons other than conflict between  the  evidence  of  the
     wife and of the Appellant.  This is of particular importance  for  the
     probability of the Appellant being invited to the campus to sing songs
     in praise of somebody against whom the students  had  already  turned.
     His evidence was inconsistent with the CIPU Report  which  dealt  with
     demonstrations at around that time and did not deal with  any  at  the
     university in April 2000.  His documentary evidence contradicted  what
     he said about his music being banned on the radio from  October  2000.
     He had made no reference to  the  military  raiding  his  house.   The
     Adjudicator was also entitled to look at the way in which  he  entered
     the United Kingdom and allowed his visa to expire  without  attempting
     to regularise his stay.

 61. It was also suggested that the Adjudicator had failed to grapple  with
     a simple point which was, why would the Appellant leave C�te  d'Ivoire
     as a successful musician if he were not in fact being persecuted?  The
     Appellant's evidence was that his music had  been  banned  by  October
     2000, and although the Adjudicator concluded  that  that  was  not  so
     because the album Red Lights had been produced  and  released  in  May
     2001, he said it had not been successful.   Although  the  Adjudicator
     refers to the potential success of that album,  she  regarded  him  as
     attempting to play down its success.  It  is  perfectly  obvious  that
     somebody who may make a living as a talented  and  perhaps  successful
     musician in C�te d'Ivoire might have good economic reasons for seeking
     to work in the United Kingdom.  However, this general point made by Mr
     Morgan is more a matter of rhetoric, than a point  identified  in  the
     grounds of appeal or point raised for the Adjudicator as a significant
     point.

 62. Mr Morgan was invited to identify the best of the points which he  was
     taking in relation to the very many criticisms that had  been  raised.
     He referred to the conclusion in paragraph 108 to the effect that  the
     Appellant had exaggerated his personal relationship with General  Guei
     in order to enhance his claim.  The Appellant had  said  that  he  was
     invited to the General's home in order to be  enlisted  to  controvert
     what another popular singer was singing about the General.  It is said
     that the Adjudicator had failed to identify how or in  what  way  that
     had been exaggerated:  why  would  he  leave  if  he  was  "presumably
     prosperous" as Mr Morgan put it?   The  Adjudicator  was  entitled  to
     conclude that he had exaggerated this  personal  relationship  because
     there was no supporting material for it.  The Adjudicator did  have  a
     considerable amount  of  evidence  produced  by  the  Appellant  which
     related to his music, reviews of it  and  the  way  in  which  he  was
     regarded in C�te d'Ivoire, but there was nothing  in  that,  which  is
     what the Adjudicator is referring to, to confirm the claim.  There was
     no other evidence orally which confirmed that.  The  Adjudicator  also
     was aware of the difficulties which she had with the  Appellant's  own
     evidence.   The  Adjudicator's  finding  was  properly  open  to   her
     considering all the evidence.

 63. It is complained that  the  Adjudicator  on  a  number  of  occasions,
     misunderstood  the  significance  of  another  singer,  called   Alpha
     Blondie, remaining in the C�te d'Ivoire without problems regardless of
     having composed numerous political songs.  It is said that that is  an
     error because he was not a supporter of General Guei and so was  in  a
     different position to the Appellant.  Whether that is so or  not,  the
     Adjudicator was entitled to rely on the absence of any suggestion that
     the Appellant's musical partner, Alan Bill, ever faced  any  problems.
     He had been the main singer on El Mutino.  It is very far  from  clear
     from the various reports which the Appellant produced that the comment
     that he made that Alpha Blondie was anti-General Guei is a  sufficient
     explanation for the lack of problems which he faced.  They  both  sing
     politicised songs and it is suggested in a BBC World Service  document
     that Blondie had been singing highly politicised songs for many  years
     before and after the coup in December 1999.

 64. There is nothing in the riposte by Mr Bobb to the finding in paragraph
     112 that the wife had made no mention whatsoever of his music  in  her
     application for appeal, in her statement that she had accompanied  her
     husband to a concert.  The real point which the Adjudicator is  making
     is that, as it is said that the Appellant's singing and music  writing
     was central to the way in which he would  be  viewed  were  he  to  be
     returned, it is astonishing that the case  was  not  put  along  those
     lines in the Appellant's wife's appeal.  The reference to an error  in
     relation to regularity of contact, if  it  is  an  error,  is  trivial
     relating as it does simply to the dispute about frequency.

 65. At paragraph 113, the Adjudicator's reference to taking the matter  no
     further as it has no direct bearing on the asylum claim is a reference
     not to the irrelevance of the  wife's  credibility  to  the  husband's
     claim, but to the fact that their joint endeavour to deceive the  Home
     Office in relation to the wife's claim had no direct  bearing  on  the
     validity of the Appellant's claim.  The conclusion of the  Adjudicator
     in relation to the CIPU Report is  not  answered  by  the  Appellant's
     citation of a reference to a demonstration some six months later  than
     the one which the Adjudicator was concerned with.  There is even  less
     in the other points raised.

 66. Accordingly, for the reasons which  we  have  given,  this  appeal  is
     dismissed.
