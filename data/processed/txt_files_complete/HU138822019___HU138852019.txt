Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms Jaja, instructed by Howe & Co Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Bates, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS



 1. The appellants appeal, with permission granted by  First-tier  Tribunal
    ("FtT") Judge Gumsley, against FtT Judge  Moon's  decision  to  dismiss
    their appeals against the respondent's refusal of  their  human  rights
    claims.

Background

 2. The appellants are Nepalese nationals who are now 37 and 34  years  old
    respectively.  They sought entry clearance to join  their  mother,  the
    sponsor.  She is Diga Maya Rai, a Nepalese national who is  settled  in
    the UK.  Mrs Rai's late husband and the father of the  two  appellants,
    Dal Bahadur Rai, was a soldier in the Brigade of Gurkhas  between  1964
    and 1980.  Mr Rai passed away on 24 July 2001.

 3. The sponsor and Mr Rai had  four  children.   The  appellants  are  the
    youngest two children.  The other two children, a son and  a  daughter,
    are married and live in Hong Kong.  The sponsor entered the UK  as  the
    widow of a Gurkha veteran on 26 July 2012.

 4. On 25 March 2019, the appellants applied for entry  clearance  to  join
    their mother in the UK.  They stated that they had been born in Khotang
    but they gave a permanent residential address in  Dhara.   They  stated
    that they were both unemployed;  that  they  were  supported  by  their
    mother; and that they were in contact  with  her  by  using  Viber  and
    telephone cards.  Various documents were submitted with the application
    in order to support the family relationship and the  sponsor's  ongoing
    relationship with the appellants.

 5. The applications were refused on 26 June 2019.  The respondent did  not
    consider her published policy to apply as the appellants  were  seeking
    to join their mother as opposed to a retired Gurkha soldier.  She noted
    that the appellants had been described as  married  on  their  mother's
    application for settlement.  The respondent did  not  accept  that  the
    appellants were reliant upon their mother.  As for Article 8 ECHR,  the
    respondent did not accept that there was a  family  life  in  existence
    between the appellant and the sponsor.

The Appeals to the First-tier Tribunal

 6. The appellants appealed to the First-tier Tribunal  and  their  appeals
    were heard together by Judge Moon  ('the  judge'),  sitting  at  Hatton
    Cross on 22 October 2020.  The appellants were represented by Ms  Jaja,
    as they were before  me.   The  judge  heard  oral  evidence  from  the
    appellant, who attended the hearing remotely.   She  heard  submissions
    from Ms Jaja  and  from  the  respondent's  Presenting  Officer  before
    reserving her decision.

 7. In her reserved decision, the judge proceeded - with the concurrence of
    the advocates - on the basis that the appellants had not married:  [7].
    The judge noted the evidence and the events at the  hearing:  [8]-[13].
    At [14]-[20], the judge stated that  the  only  issue  before  her  was
    whether the refusal amounted to a  disproportionate  interference  with
    the appellants' Article 8 rights  and  she  cited  relevant  authority,
    including Jitendra Rai v ECO [2017] EWCA Civ 320 on the proper approach
    to such case.

 8. The judge then grouped her analysis under two sub-headings:  'Emotional
    Dependency' and 'Financial Dependency'.  At [22], she noted that  there
    was an inconsistency over the number of times the sponsor  had  visited
    Nepal, in that she had said that there had  been  five  visits  in  her
    witness statement but her passport only  disclosed  four  visits.   The
    judge stated that this was likely to be a simple mistake  and  that  it
    made no material difference to her decision.

 9. There was, the judge stated,  'as  much  direct  contact  as  possible'
    between the appellants and the sponsor.  For reasons she gave at  [23]-
    [25], the judge found that the appellants  were  in  contact  with  the
    sponsor once a week or every two to three days.  She rejected Ms Jaja's
    submission  that  there  was  overwhelming  evidence  of  almost  daily
    contact.  At [26]-[27], the judge noted that the  appellants  were  not
    said to have any other relatives in Nepal and  that  they  spent  their
    time living on the money they were sent by the sponsor and  socialising
    with their friends.

10. At [28]-[29], the judge expressed concern over what she thought  was  a
    second inconsistency in the evidence.  She understood  the  sponsor  to
    have stated in her witness statement that Dharan, where the  appellants
    live, is a village, whereas she had stated in oral evidence that it was
    a city.  The evidence suggested, the judge concluded, that Dharan was a
    larger town or city.

11. Having considered the evidence about  the  appellant's  employment,  or
    lack thereof, at [30], the judge returned  to  her  concern  about  the
    description of Dharan.  She noted that 'there is  an  inconsistency  in
    the sponsor's evidence as to whether Dharan is a village  or  a  city'.
    She did not accept that there  were  no  job  opportunities  for  these
    English speaking appellants: [31].

12. At [32], the judge accepted that the appellants had had the benefit  of
    the sponsor's pension for two years.  She did not accept that they  had
    had access to the pension before then.  The judge had  similar  concern
    in relation to the money remittance slips,  in  that  there  were  none
    which were dated prior to November 2017. For reasons she gave at  [35],
    the judge declined to draw an inference that  there  had  been  regular
    transfers since 2012.  She concluded that the sponsor  was  simply  not
    able - given her income - to afford to make  regular  payments  in  the
    sums claimed.

13. The judge was prepared to assume at [39] that the appellants lived rent-
    free in the family home  but  she  was  concerned  that  there  was  no
    evidence from the appellants to explain how they spent  their  mother's
    pension.  This was evidence which would have been easy  to  obtain  but
    the appellants had 'elected to remain silent  in  their  own  appeals':
    [40].  There was no evidence  before  the  Tribunal  to  establish  the
    amount that the appellants required to meet the monthly outgoings.  All
    things considered, the judge  concluded  that  there  was  insufficient
    evidence of financial dependency: [44].

14. In the concluding paragraphs of the decision, the judge recalled  again
    what had been said in Jitendra Rai and  Kugathas.   At  [47]-[48],  she
    summarised her conclusions in this way:

         "[47] Considering the evidence as a whole and applying the  factors
         set out by Arden LJ in Kugathas specifically, identifying the  near
         relatives and considering the links between  them.   I  have  taken
         into account that these adult children, aged 34  and  36  have  the
         support of each other, the possibility of  emotional  support  from
         cousins in  Nepal,  the  appellants  are  not  therefore  entirely,
         without family support in Nepal.  I  am  satisfied  that  there  is
         frequent contact between the appellants and the sponsor but, I find
         that telephone calls, even if made on a  daily  basis,  do  not  in
         themselves demonstrate that more than normal emotional ties  exist.
         Frequent  and  daily  contact  between  adult  family  members   by
         messages, telephone calls and other modern means  of  communication
         is not uncommon.

         [48] Taking all of these factors into account, I am unable to  find
         that there are elements  of  dependency  going  beyond  the  normal
         emotional ties that would usually exist between adult children  and
         their parents. I therefore find that there is no family life and so
         Article 8 is not engaged."

15. It was for those reasons that the judge dismissed the appeals.

The Appeals to the Upper Tribunal

16. Ms Jaja sought and was granted permission to appeal on two grounds.

17. By the first, Ms Jaja submits that the judge misdirected herself in law
    in her consideration of whether Article  8  ECHR  was  engaged  in  its
    family life aspect.  This was particularly apparent at [44],  [45]  and
    [48], she submitted, in which the judge appeared to have substituted  a
    test of dependency in place of the test in Rai.

18. By the second ground, Ms Jaja submits that the judge made two  mistakes
    of fact which amount to errors of law.  Both  relate  to  the  supposed
    inconsistences which the judge found to exist in the evidence.  Ms Jaja
    submits that there was no inconsistency  in  the  evidence  as  to  the
    number of times the sponsor had visited Nepal.  She said that  she  had
    visited five times and that was the  number  of  visits  shown  in  the
    sponsor's passport, contrary to the judge's analysis at [22]. The judge
    also misread the sponsor's witness statement  in  relation  to  Dharan.
    The sponsor's statement made reference to  the  family's  life  in  the
    village and  then  to  their  relocation  to  Dharan.   She  had  never
    suggested that  Dharan  was  the  village  and  the  judge  had  simply
    misunderstood what was said.  Whilst there were other  aspects  of  the
    judge's  reasoning  which  stood  unchallenged,   these   errors   were
    sufficient in Ms Jaja's submission to necessitate the judge's  decision
    being set aside and the decision on the appeal being remade afresh.

19. In her response to the grounds and her oral submissions, the respondent
    does not accept that the judge erred in her approach to the  engagement
    of Article 8 ECHR.  She had cited and applied relevant authority and it
    was unrealistic to suggest that the judge had not applied the  law  she
    had cited.  Insofar as the judge had erred in her conclusions about the
    number of visits to Nepal and the description of Dharan,  these  errors
    were not material to the outcome of the appeal.   Mr  Bates  noted,  on
    behalf of the respondent, that the judge's mathematical analysis of the
    sponsor ability to support the appellants to  the  extent  claimed  was
    unchallenged and cogent.

20. I reserved my decision at the end of the submissions.

Analysis

21. The test for establishing whether Article 8  ECHR  is  engaged  in  its
    family life aspect between a parent and  their  adult  child  has  been
    established for at least 37 years.  In Odawey v  ECO  [2011]  EWCA  Civ
    840, Rix LJ summarised the position, and  some  of  the  learning  from
    which it derived, as follows:

         "[35] As for the position of parents  and  adult  children,  it  is
         established that family life will not normally exist  between  them
         within the meaning of article 8 at all in the  absence  of  further
         elements of dependency which go beyond normal emotional ties: see S
         v. United Kingdom  (1984)  40  DR  196  ,  Abdulaziz,  Cabales  and
         Balkandali v. United Kingdom [1985] 7 EHRR 471 ,  Advic  v.  United
         Kingdom [1995] EHRR 57 , Kugathas v. SSHD [2003] EWCA Civ 31 ,  and
         JB (India) v. ECO [2009] EWCA Civ 234 . That is  not  to  say  that
         reliance on the further element of financial dependency will  bring
         a breach of article 8: no case in  which  it  has  in  the  present
         context has been discovered."

22. Nothing said by Lindblom  LJ  (with  whom  Henderson  and  Beatson  LJJ
    agreed) in Jitendra Rai marked a departure from that line of authority.
     The principal error into which the Deputy  Upper  Tribunal  judge  had
    fallen into that case was to require the appellant to demonstrate  some
    form of exceptional feature in  the  appellant's  dependency  upon  his
    parents as a necessary determinant of the existence of his family  life
    with them.  So much is clear from what was  said  by  Lindblom  LJ  and
    Beatson LJ at [36] and [61] respectively.

23. There was no such error on the part of the judge in this case.  She was
    plainly well aware of the test to be applied.  She  cited  Kugathas  at
    [17] of her decision and she set out what was said by Sedley LJ at [17]
    of his judgment in  that  case,  about  reading  down  the  concept  of
    dependency so as to mean support and considering whether  such  support
    was real, committed or effective.  The judge went on to cite  what  had
    been said by Arden LJ (as she then was) at [24]-[25] of Kugathas.   She
    was aware of the  holding  in  Ghising  [2012]  UKUT  567  (IAC),  that
    Kugathas had been interpreted too restrictively in the  past:  [19]  of
    her decision refers.  And she then set out relevant sections of Rai  at
    [20] of her decision.  With respect to the judge, it is not easy to see
    how she could have given herself a clearer or more comprehensive  self-
    direction.

24. Ms Jaja seizes in her submissions on the fact that the judge  used  the
    term 'dependency' on more than one occasion in her decision.  This, she
    submits, is evidence that the wrong test was being  applied;  what  the
    judge should have been searching for was  whether  there  was  real  or
    committed or effective support.

25. I am unable to  accept  this  submission,  which  loses  sight  of  the
    substantive analysis undertaken by the judge.  She began that  analysis
    by demonstrating the clearest possible understanding of the law and  of
    the highly fact-sensitive nature of the necessary  analysis.   She  was
    presented with a case in which the appellants  stated  that  they  were
    wholly financially dependent upon their mother and in which it was said
    that there was a higher degree of emotional dependency  between  mother
    and children than would ordinarily be expected.   Over  the  course  of
    several  paragraphs,  the  judge  made  reasoned  findings   on   those
    assertions.  In drawing together those conclusions on  the  penultimate
    page of her decision, she certainly made reference (as has the Court of
    Appeal, the ECHR and the Upper Tribunal) to dependency.  But  she  also
    made repeated reference to 'support', at [45] and [47] in particular.

26. It would be to read the decision inaccurately to suggest that the judge
    proceeded on the basis that nothing short of dependency  would  suffice
    to establish a family life in these circumstances.  She considered  the
    emotional and financial support which flowed from the  sponsor  to  the
    appellants and she concluded that the evidence did  not  show  anything
    more than the normal emotional ties that would  usually  exist  between
    adult children and their parents. The judge's application  of  the  law
    which she had set out in the earlier  stages  of  her  decision  cannot
    properly be faulted, in my judgment.

27. I am bound to say that I am wholly unimpressed with the point taken  by
    Ms Jaja in relation to the sponsor's passport.  It is  clear  -  as  is
    accepted by Mr Bates in his realistic  submissions  -  that  the  judge
    erred in thinking that the passport only showed  the  sponsor  to  have
    visited Nepal on four occasions.  There is evidence of five visits  and
    the judge erred in thinking otherwise.  At  [22],  however,  the  judge
    stated that she was proceeding on the basis that the sponsor had made a
    simple mistake and that the  point  was  immaterial  to  her  decision.
    There is no reason to think that  the  judge  somehow  held  the  point
    against the appellants even though she said she had not.  And I am  not
    prepared to accept that this was evidence of a general lack of care  in
    the judge's analysis.  The  decision  is  generally  cogent  and  well-
    reasoned.  Insofar as ground two is premised on  the  judge's  slip  at
    [22], it cannot prosper.

28. I am much more concerned about the other half of ground two and  it  is
    perhaps only fair that to record that I have changed my mind about  the
    point more than once since reserving my decision.

29. It is clear that the judge made a mistake when she concluded that there
    was an inconsistency in the evidence.  The  sponsor  spoke  about  'the
    village' in her witness statement.  She described  a  basic  and  rural
    lifestyle in the village.  She then moved on, in the same part  of  the
    witness statement, to speak about the family's  life  in  Dharan.   The
    judge clearly formed the impression that the sponsor was describing one
    and the same location in this part of her witness statement.  In  doing
    so, the judge seems to have overlooked the first sentence  of  [10]  of
    the witness statement, in which  the  sponsor  said  that  her  husband
    decided to move the family to Dharan after he was discharged  from  the
    British Army.  The judge also appears to have overlooked the fact  that
    the appellants' applications forms chime with this description, in that
    they both gave their places of birth as Khotang but  their  address  in
    Nepal as Dharan.

30. The judge therefore erred when she concluded that  the  sponsor's  oral
    evidence about the size of Dharan had changed.  She had  not  described
    Dharan as a village in her witness statement and her oral evidence that
    it was a city did not represent a departure from the account which bore
    her signature.

31. The difficulty with this ground lies not in whether or  not  the  judge
    erred.  It is clear that she did,  as  I  have  explained  above.   The
    difficulty is, instead, as to whether or not the error was material  to
    the outcome of the appeal.  Mr Tan, who wrote the respondent's response
    to the grounds of appeal, and Mr Bates, who appeared  before  me,  both
    argued persuasively that the error was not  a  material  one.   Mr  Tan
    emphasised the fact that the judge clearly proceeded on the basis  that
    Dharan is a city.  He  submits,  therefore,  that  the  error  did  not
    distract the judge from considering the real facts.  For his  part,  Mr
    Bates drew my attention to the fact that there were other parts of  the
    decision which were beyond challenge and submitted that the judge would
    necessarily have reached the same conclusion even if she had not  erred
    in this respect.

32. With some hesitation, I have ultimately come to the conclusion that the
    judge's error about the sponsor's evidence vitiated her  assessment  of
    the relationship between the appellants and the sponsor.  I  am  unable
    to accept Mr Tan's submission that the judge  ultimately  proceeded  on
    the correct footing about the size of Dharan and that the error made no
    difference as a result.  The difficulty with that submission  is  clear
    from [31] of the judge's decision,  which  starts  with  the  following
    sentence:




         "Whilst I recognise that  the  employment  situation  in  Nepal  is
         difficult, there is an inconsistency in the sponsor's  evidence  in
         relation to whether Dharan is a village or a city."

33.  As  Ms  Jaja  submitted,  therefore,  the  judge's  error  about   the
    consistency of the sponsor's evidence went on to colour her view of the
    evidence  she  had  heard.   Had  the  judge  been  correct  about  the
    discrepancy, it is not difficult to see why.  If  she  considered  that
    the sponsor had attempted in  her  witness  statement  to  portray  the
    appellants as living a basic, rural lifestyle in the  hills  of  Nepal,
    only to admit in her oral testimony that they in fact lived in a  city,
    that would necessarily lead her to view what else was  said  with  some
    circumspection.  The judge was told that the appellants had not worked,
    for example, and she was unable to accept that there  were  'absolutely
    no job opportunities' for the appellants in Nepal.  She  did  not  make
    that finding purely because the  appellants  lived  in  the  city;  the
    concern she had expressed over the preceding three paragraphs about the
    sponsor's inconsistent evidence must  have  been  factored  in  to  her
    refusal to accept what she had been told in  this  respect.   As  Judge
    Gumsley put it in granting permission: "this was a factor  which  would
    have featured in the Judge's ultimate assessment of the  truth  of  the
    case the sponsor advanced."

34. Mr Bates' submission  that  the  judge  would  have  reached  the  same
    conclusion in any event fails for the same reason.  The  judge  clearly
    thought that she was evaluating the evidence of a witness (the sponsor)
    who had attempted to change her account about the place  in  which  the
    appellants live.  It was  through  that  prism  that  she  went  on  to
    consider other aspects of what the sponsor said.  The judge scrutinised
    the sponsor's finances very carefully and concluded that she was unable
    to accept that she had been sending �400 or so,  eight  times  a  year,
    since 2012.

35. The important point, for present purposes, is that the evidence  showed
    that such payments had been made since  2017  and  the  judge  was  not
    prepared to draw an inference that these payments had been made for the
    preceding five years.  One factor in that conclusion was the persuasive
    mathematical  analysis  she  undertook  at  [35]-[37].    Another   was
    undoubtedly the circumspection with  which  she  viewed  the  sponsor's
    evidence as a result of the mistake the judge had  made  about  Dharan.
    Despite Mr Bates' determined submissions that the error over Dharan can
    simply  be  severed  from  the  rest  of  the  decision,  I  have  come
    reluctantly to the conclusion that it cannot.  The judge's analysis  of
    the sponsor's account got off on the wrong foot and I cannot know where
    it would have ended if she had not erred as she did.

36. I will therefore set aside the decision of the FtT and direct that  the
    appeal is to be reheard by the FtT.  In doing  so,  I  should  make  it
    quite clear that the points made by  the  judge  at  [35]-[44]  of  her
    decision were cogent and that the appellants have  been  on  notice  of
    those points since October 2020.  They are on notice, in  other  words,
    of the concern expressed by the judge that the sponsor could not afford
    have afforded to remit  in  the  region  of  �3200  per  annum  to  the
    appellants since 2012.  They are on notice of the likelihood  that  the
    respondent will take  that  point  in  the  future  and  of  the  need,
    therefore, to attempt to meet it with financial evidence, failing which
    inferences might properly be drawn.  And they  are  on  notice  of  the
    perfectly proper concern expressed by the judge about the absence of  a
    witness statement from either of the appellants dealing, in particular,
    with their need, in their thirties, to rely on their  mother's  pension
    whilst living rent-free in the family home.

37. For the avoidance of doubt, however, the rehearing of this appeal  will
    be de novo.



Notice of Decision

The First-tier Tribunal's decision involved the making  of  an  error  on  a
point of law.  I set that decision aside  and  direct  that  the  appeal  be
remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a de novo hearing.
