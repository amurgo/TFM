                         (ANONYMITY ORDER NOT MADE)
                                                                   Appellant


                                     and



               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent


           DECISION MADE PURSUANT TO RULES 34, 39 & 40 (3) OF THE
               TRIBUNAL PROCEDURE (UPPER TRIBUNAL) RULES 2008

   1. On 26 July 2017, this appeal came  before  me  and  I  set  aside  the
      decision of the First-tier Tribunal. On 11 October 2017,  I  gave  the
      following directions: -


         1. Further  to  the  directions  given  on  30  August  2017,  the
            appellant has made further submissions, to which the respondent
            has replied in a letter dated 10 October 2017, stating that the
            Secretary of State has decided to grant the appellant leave  to
            remain pursuant to article 8.


         2. In the light of the letter from the respondent  of  10  October
            2017, it is my provisional  view  that  the  appeal  should  be
            allowed without any further hearing and without giving detailed
            reasons, as is permitted pursuant to rules 34, 39 and 40 (3) of
            the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.


         3. Unless either party objects to this course of action in writing
            within 10 working days,  the  Upper  Tribunal  will  allow  the
            appeal on the above basis.


         4. The parties are put on notice  that,  in  the  absence  of  any
            express written objection, they will for the purposes  of  rule
            40 (3) be deemed to have consented to the  Upper  Tribunal  not
            giving reasons.


   3. There has been no objection to the proposed course  of  action  within
      the time specified.


   4. Rule 40 (1) of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
      provided that the Upper Tribunal may  give  a  decision  orally  at  a
      hearing. Ruled 40 (3) provides that the Upper  Tribunal  must  provide
      written reasons for its decision with a  decision  notice  unless  the
      parties have consented  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  not  giving  written
      reasons. I am satisfied that the parties are,  in  the  light  of  the
      directions made, deemed to given such consent in failing to object  to
      the proposed course of action.


   5. In the circumstances, pursuant  to  the  decision  promulgated  on  30
      August 2017, the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
      making of an error of law and is set aside. The appeal  is  remade  by
      allowing the appeal on human rights grounds.




      Signed                       Date: 6 November 2017
