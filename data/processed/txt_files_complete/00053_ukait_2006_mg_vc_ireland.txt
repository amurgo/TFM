(1)  The Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006  contain  the
law relating to all EEA appeals dealt with from the  date  of  the  date  of
their commencement:  the old Regulations  are  not  applicable  to  the  old
appeals; (2)  A decision to deport an EEA national  is  a  decision  "under"
the Regulations and is therefore a "relevant decision" for the  purposes  of
them, however it is expressed;  (3)  Regulation 21 (and  the  provisions  of
Directive 2004/38/EC)  may make it  more  difficult  for  the  Secretary  of
State to remove or deport an EEA national on the ground of criminal  conduct
than appeared to be the case previously.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

  1. These two reconsiderations were heard together.   The  Appellants  are
     citizens of European Union countries who  have  successfully  appealed
     against decisions that they should be deported from the United Kingdom
     on the ground that their deportation is conducive to the public  good.
     The reconsideration is, therefore, in each case, at  the  instance  of
     the Respondent.  These cases are the first opportunity that  a  senior
     panel of the Tribunal has had to examine Directive 2004/38/EC  of  the
     European Parliament and of the Council and the  Immigration  (European
     Economic Area) Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/1003) in the context  of  the
     present intense public interest in the deportation of non-UK nationals
     convicted of criminal offences.

  2. In order to  set  that  context  a  little  more  widely,  it  may  be
     appropriate briefly  to  indicate  the  principles  applying  to  such
     action.  A person who is not a British citizen is, under  s3(5)(a)  of
     the Immigration Act 1971 as amended, liable to  deportation  from  the
     United Kingdom if the Secretary of State deems his deportation  to  be
     conducive to the public good.  In addition, by s3(6) of the same  Act,
     a person who is not a British citizen  is  liable  to  deportation  in
     certain circumstances if, on his conviction for an offence  punishable
     with imprisonment, he is recommended for  deportation  by  the  court.
     The power under s3(5)(a) is not limited to those convicted of criminal
     offences, although the vast majority  of  decisions  made  under  that
     section relate to those who have been convicted of criminal offences.

  3. The decision to make a deportation order is  never  automatic.   Every
     case has to be considered on  its  merits,  as  provided  for  in  the
     Immigration Rules, currently in  paragraph  364  of  HC  395.   Before
     making a decision to deport a person, the Secretary of  State  or  his
     officer is required to take into account all relevant factors known to
     him, including age;   length  of  residence  in  the  United  Kingdom;
     strength of connections with the United  Kingdom;   personal  history,
     including  character,  conduct  and   employment   record;    domestic
     circumstances;  previous criminal record and the nature of any offence
     of which the person has been convicted;  compassionate  circumstances;
     and any representations received on the person's behalf.  The duty  to
     take all relevant  circumstances  into  account  applies  whether  the
     liability to deportation arises under s3(5) or s3(6) of the 1971  Act.
     Even a recommendation by a criminal court,  therefore,  does  not  and
     cannot   lead   automatically   to   deportation.    How   many   such
     recommendations do result in deportation is not known:  from  research
     undertaken by the Sentencing Guidelines Panel (Consultation  Paper  on
     Recommendations for Deportation (2005), p3, notes 3-4) it appears that
     1996  was  the  last  year  for  which  such  figures  were  routinely
     collected.

  4. The Refugee Convention, as is well known,  prohibits  the  removal  of
     refugees to their own countries if they have a  well-founded  fear  of
     persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership  of
     a particular social group, or political opinion.  The  prohibition  on
     removal of Convention refugees is, however, removed in cases where the
     refugee  has  committed  a  "particularly  serious   crime"   and   so
     constitutes a danger to the community of the country in  which  he  is
     living.  For the  purposes  of  United  Kingdom  law,  the  phrase  in
     inverted commas is defined by s72(2) of the  Nationality,  Immigration
     and Asylum Act 2002 as meaning a crime resulting, on conviction in the
     United Kingdom, to a sentence of at  least  two  years'  imprisonment.
     (There are similar provisions applying to those convicted outside  the
     United Kingdom.)  It is not known whether  this  provision  of  United
     Kingdom law amounts to a correct interpretation of the  terms  of  the
     Convention.

  5. Although in the circumstances we have just mentioned a  person  cannot
     escape deportation by claiming the benefits of the Refugee Convention,
     he cannot be deported  if  his  deportation  would  breach  his  human
     rights.  The legislation to that effect derives from the Human  Rights
     Act 1998, which, with associated provisions relating  to  immigration,
     and changes to the Immigration Rules, came into effect  on  2  October
     2000.  It follows that a person may not in practice be deported if the
     only country to which he could be deported is one where he would be at
     risk of torture or  inhuman  or  degrading  treatment  or  punishment,
     because his removal there would  be  a  breach  of  his  rights  under
     Article 3.  Other Articles of the European Convention on Human  Rights
     may also have a practical effect on deportation cases,  in  particular
     Article 2 (right to life) and Article 8 (right to respect for  private
     and family life).  It is sometimes said that a  criminal's  invocation
     of his own human rights is inappropriate, or undeserved,  or  cynical.
     The position is, however, that the law of this country is  that  those
     rights are to be respected.

  6. There is no doubt in general that the decision to make  a  deportation
     order on conducive grounds is, in part at least,  a  response  to  the
     individual's conduct.  So  much  is  clear  from  the  fact  that  the
     recommendation for deportation can be made by a criminal court as part
     of the way in which it deals with an offender on conviction,  and  can
     itself be the subject of an appeal on sentence to the Court of  Appeal
     (Criminal Division).  In cases where no such recommendation  is  made,
     the assessment of the "public good" clearly also includes the need  to
     respond firmly to the commission of a serious crime (see N  (Kenya)  v
     SSHD [2004] EWCA Civ 1094, especially paragraphs [64]-[65] per May LJ,
     and [94] per Judge LJ).  Although any recommendation  for  deportation
     has to be made at the time of sentence, however, and despite the  fact
     that a deportation decision will  be,  in  part,  a  response  to  the
     individual's past conduct, the appropriate time to make  the  decision
     will be shortly before it is to be  carried  out:   that  is  to  say,
     towards the end of a prison sentence (Chindamo v SSHD 00/TH/02345).

  7. When there has been a decision to make a deportation order, the person
     affected has a right of appeal.  The availability and possible  length
     of  the  appellate  process  has  expanded   considerably   owing   to
     legislative changes in recent years.  Before 2000, decisions  to  make
     deportation orders on conducive grounds could be appealed only to  the
     Immigration Appeal Tribunal, the upper tier  of  the  old  Immigration
     Appellate Authority.  Thus, all  these  cases  were  considered  by  a
     relatively small number of individuals, who acquired some expertise in
     them.  Under the provisions of the  1999  Act,  conducive  deportation
     appeals went at first instance  to  an  Adjudicator,  like  all  other
     immigration appeals, and  so,  like  all  other  immigration  appeals,
     carried the possibility of a further appeal to the Immigration  Appeal
     Tribunal.  That further appeal  was  restricted  by  the  Nationality,
     Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 to an appeal on a point  of  law,  and
     now takes the form of a reconsideration on a point of law.

  8. Decisions to make a deportation order following the recommendation  of
     a court could not be the subject  of  an  appeal  to  the  Immigration
     Appellate Authority until s82 of the 2002 Act came  into  force  on  1
     April  2003.   All  decisions  to  make  deportation  orders  are  now
     appealable and, once the appellate decision has been made,  there  may
     be a reconsideration within the terms of the  Asylum  and  Immigration
     (Treatment of Claimants, etc) Act 2004.

  9. The deportation of nationals of countries in the  European  Union  and
     the European Economic Area has been subject  to  special  restrictions
     from the beginning.  Directive 64/221/EEC prevented the expulsion of a
     person exercising Treaty rights, or a member of his  family,  save  on
     grounds of public policy, public security or public health.  Article 3
     of that Directive contains the following provisions:

           "1.   Measures taken on grounds of public policy  or  of  public
                 security shall be based exclusively on the personal conduct
                 of the individual concerned.
              2. Previous  criminal  convictions  shall  not  in  themselves
                 constitute grounds for the taking of such measures.
           ..."


 10. In Monsignore v Oberstadtdirektor der Stadt K�ln (Case  67/74)  [1975]
     ECR 297, the German authorities sought to deport an Italian worker who
     had accidentally killed his brother whilst handling a gun which he had
     obtained apparently illegally.  There was no suggestion that he  would
     commit a similar offence again  and  the  intention  was  that  he  be
     deported as a general deterrent to  others.   The  European  Court  of
     Justice held that  Article  3(2)  prohibited  deportation  of  an  EEC
     national for that reason.  In R v Bouchereau [1978] QB  732,  where  a
     French national had pleaded guilty to offences relating to  prohibited
     drugs, the ECJ said that:

           "Recourse by a national or authority to the  concept  of  public
           policy presupposes, in any event, the existence, in addition  to
           the perturbation of the social order which any  infringement  of
           the law involves, of a genuine and sufficiently  serious  threat
           to the requirements  of  public  policy  affecting  one  of  the
           fundamental interests of society."

 11. The Court continued by indicating that:

           "Although, in general, a  finding  that  such  a  threat  exists
           implies  the  existence  in  the  individual  concerned   of   a
           propensity to act in the same way in the future, it is  possible
           that past conduct alone may constitute  such  a  threat  to  the
           requirements of public policy."

 12. Subsequent UK cases, in particular R v SSHD ex p Marchon [1993] Imm AR
     384, have held that particularly disgraceful criminal conduct  may  of
     itself merit the reaction of deportation of an  EEA  national  without
     reference to propensity to re-offend:  but  Nazli  v  Stadt  N�rnberg,
     (Case C-340/97), [2000] ECR I-957, suggests clearly that  those  views
     were unsound as a matter of Community law.

 13. The provisions now in force derive from the Directive 2004/38/EC whose
     purpose is in part to promote the notion of citizenship of  the  Union
     as set out in part 2 of the consolidated version of  the  Treaty.   In
     doing so, it adopts wording which attempts to set out  the  effect  of
     the development of the rights of nationals of EU countries not  to  be
     removed from countries in which they  are  exercising  Treaty  rights.
     The underlying notion is no doubt that for many purposes a citizen  of
     an EU country is to be regarded as in  his  own  country  when  he  is
     exercising a Treaty right within another European Union country.

 14. For the purposes of English law, the  Immigration  (European  Economic
     Area) Regulations 2006 implement the Directive and are the  provisions
     with which we are directly concerned.  The  relevant  Regulations  are
     the following:

           "Permanent right of residence
           15. - (1)  The following persons  shall  acquire  the  right  to
           reside in the United Kingdom permanently -
           (a)  an EEA national who has resided in the  United  Kingdom  in
           accordance with these Regulations for  a  continuous  period  of
           five years;
           (b)   a family member of an EEA national who is not  himself  an
           EEA national but who has resided in the United Kingdom with  the
           EEA  national  in  accordance  with  these  Regulations  for   a
           continuous period of five years;
           (c)   a worker or self-employed person who has ceased activity;
           (d)   the family member of a worker or self-employed person
           (e)   a person who was the family member of a  worker  or  self-
           employed where -
                 (i)  the worker or self-employed person has died;
                 (ii)  the  family  member  resided  with  him  immediately
           before his death; and
                 (iii)  the  worker  or  self-employed  person  had  resided
                 continuously in the United Kingdom for  at  least  the  two
                 years immediately before his death or  the  death  was  the
                 result of an accident at work or an occupational disease;
            (f)  a person who -
                 (i)  has resided in the United Kingdom in  accordance  with
                 these Regulations for a continuous period  of  five  years;
                 and
                 (ii)  was, at the end of that period, a family  member  who
                 has returned the right of residence.
           (2)  Once acquired, the right of permanent residence under  this
           regulation shall be lost only through absence  from  the  United
           Kingdom for a period exceeding two consecutive years.
           (3)  But this regulation is subject to regulation 19(3)(b)


           Exclusion and removal from the United Kingdom
           19. - (1) A person is not entitled to be admitted to the  United
           Kingdom by virtue of regulation 11 if his exclusion is justified
           on grounds of public policy, public security or public health in
           accordance with regulation 21
           ...
           (3)  Subject to paragraph (4) and (5) [which are not relevant in
           these appeals], a person who has been admitted to, or acquired a
           right to reside in, the United Kingdom under  these  Regulations
           may be removed from the United Kingdom if -
                 (a)  he does not have or ceases to have a right  to  reside
                 under these Regulations; or
                 (b)  he would otherwise be entitled to reside in the United
                 Kingdom under these Regulations but the Secretary of  State
                 has decided that his removal is justified on the grounds of
                 public  policy,  public  security  or  public   health   in
                 accordance with regulation 21.
                 ...

            Decisions taken on public policy, public security and public
health ground
           21. -  (1)  In these regulation a 'relevant decision'  means  an
           EEA decision taken on  the  grounds  of  public  policy,  public
           security or public health.
           (2)  A relevant decision may not  be  taken  to  serve  economic
           ends.
           (3)  A relevant decision may not be taken in respect of a person
           which a permanent right of residence under regulation 15  except
           on serious grounds of public policy or public security.
           (4)  A relevant decision may not be taken except  on  imperative
           grounds of public security in respect of an EEA national who -
                 (a)  has resided in the United  Kingdom  for  a  continuous
                 period of at least ten years prior to the relevant decision
                 (b)  is under the age of 18, unless the  relevant  decision
                 is necessary in his best interests, as provided for in  the
                 Convention of Rights of the Child adopted  by  the  General
                 Assembly of the United Nations on 20th November 1989.
           (5)  Where a relevant decision is taken  on  grounds  of  public
           policy or public security it shall,  in  addition  to  complying
           with the preceding paragraphs of this regulation,  be  taken  in
           accordance with the following principles -
                 (a)  the  decision  must  comply  with  the  principle  of
           proportionality;
                 (b)  the decision must be based exclusively on the personal
                 conduct of the person concerned;
                 (c)  the personal conduct  of  the  person  concerned  must
                 represent  a  genuine,  present  and  sufficiently  serious
                 threat  affecting  one  of  the  fundamental  interests  of
                 society;
                 (d)  matters isolated from the particulars of the  case  or
                 which relate to considerations of general prevention do not
                 justify the decision;
                 (e)  a person's previous criminal  convictions  do  not  in
                 themselves justify the decision.
           (6)  Before taking a relevant decision on the grounds of  public
           policy or public  security  in  relation  to  a  person  who  is
           resident in the United Kingdom  the  decision  maker  must  take
           account of considerations such as  the  age,  state  of  health,
           family and economic situation of the person, the person's length
           of residence in the United  Kingdom,  the  person's  social  and
           cultural integration into the United Kingdom and the  extent  of
           the person's links with his country of origin.


           ...


           Person subject to removal
           24. - (1)  This regulation applies to a person whom it has  been
           decided to remove from the United  Kingdom  in  accordance  with
           regulation 19(3).
           ...
           (3)  Where the decision is under regulation 19(3)(b), the person
           is to be treated as if he were a person to whom section  3(5)(a)
           of the 1971 Act (liability to deportation) applied, and  section
           5 of that Act (procedure for deportation) and Schedule 3 to that
           Act (supplementary provision as to  deportation)  are  to  apply
           accordingly.
           ...

           5. - (1)  Where an appeal against an EEA decision under the 2000
           Regulations is pending immediately before 30th April  2006  that
           appeal  shall  be  treated  as  a  pending  appeal  against  the
           corresponding EEA decision under these Regulations.
           (2)  Where an appeal against an  EEA  decision  under  the  2000
           Regulations has  been  determined,  withdrawn  or  abandoned  it
           shall, on and after 30th April 2006, be  treated  as  an  appeal
           against the corresponding EEA decision under  these  Regulations
           which has been determined, withdrawn or abandoned, respectively.
           (3)  For the purpose of this paragraph -
                 (a)  a decision to refuse to admit  a  person  under  these
                 Regulations corresponds to a decision to  refuse  to  admit
                 that person under the 2000 Regulations;
                 (b)   a  decision  to  remove  a  person  under  regulation
                 19(3)(a) of these Regulations corresponds to a decision  to
                 remove that person  under  regulation  21(3)  of  the  2000
                 Regulations;
                 (c)   a  decision  to  remove  a  person  under  regulation
                 19(3)(b) of these Regulations corresponds to a decision  to
                 remove that person under regulation 21(3)(b)  of  the  2000
                 Regulations, including a decision which  is  treated  as  a
                 decision to remove a person under  regulation  21(3)(b)  of
                 the 2000 Regulations by virtue of regulation 6(3)(a) of the
                 Accession Regulations;
                 (d)  a decision to refuse to  revoke  a  deportation  order
                 made against a person under these  Regulations  corresponds
                 to a decision maker to refuse to revoke a deportation order
                 made  against  that  person  under  the  2000  Regulations,
                 including a decision which is  treated  as  a  decision  to
                 refuse  to  revoke  a  deportation  order  under  the  2000
                 Regulations  by  virtue  of  regulation  6(3)(b)   of   the
                 Accession Regulations;
                 (e)  a decision not to issue or renew or to revoke  an  EEA
                 family permit, a registration certificate  or  a  residence
                 card under these Regulations corresponds to a decision  not
                 to issue or renew or to revoke  an  EEA  family  permit,  a
                 residence permit or a residence  document  under  the  2000
                 Regulations, respectively."

 15. We need only add that the previous statutory regime, contained in  the
     Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2000 (SI 2000/2326 as
     amended) is for present purposes entirely revoked with no  savings  or
     transitional provisions.

 16. The first thing that is apparent is that the new Regulations came into
     force immediately on 30 April 2006, and that the previous  law  is  no
     longer in effect.  The effect on existing  decisions  and  appeals  is
     quite remarkable:  they are to be treated  as  decisions  and  appeals
     under the new Regulations.  The consequence may  be  that  a  decision
     lawful  when  it  was  made,  and  a  determination  by  the  Tribunal
     containing no error of law when it was made, may now disclose an error
     of law because of the retrospective change of  the  decision  and  its
     authority.

 17. Those considerations apply directly in relation to decisions under the
     previous Regulations and appeals against  EEA  decisions  under  those
     Regulations.

 18. The precise interaction between the provisions of the Immigration Acts
     and the EEA Regulations is somewhat obscure.  Fortunately, we  do  not
     need to treat it in detail for the purposes of these  appeals.   There
     are provisions providing rights of appeal against decisions made under
     the Regulations:  those rights are not exactly the same as the  rights
     of appeal against immigration decisions, provided by the 2002 Act, but
     are given with reference to provisions of that Act.  As we  understand
     the  position,  however,  where  the  Immigration  Acts  empower   the
     Secretary of State to make a decision against a person who  is  not  a
     national of  the  United  Kingdom,  such  decisions  can  (unless  the
     contrary appears) be made against a person who is an EEA  national  or
     who is or would be a qualified person under the EEA  Regulations.   In
     those circumstances, the decision will, generally speaking, not  be  a
     decision under the EEA Regulations: it will be a  decision  under  the
     relevant Act.

 19. The EEA Regulations  are  not  solely  concerned  with  appeals:   the
     Directive which they implement attributes substantive rights to  those
     governed by them.  So a person who appeals under the 2002 Act  against
     an immigration decision may invoke the Directive as implemented by the
     Regulations indirectly under s84(1)(d), which permits him to appeal on
     the ground "that the appellant is an EEA national or  a  member  of  a
     family of an EEA national and the decision  breaches  the  appellant's
     rights under  the  community  treaties  in  respect  of  entry  to  or
     residence in the United Kingdom".

 20. In those circumstances, as we have indicated, the applicable law  will
     be that of the new Regulations, because the old Regulations have  been
     revoked.  The effect is, as it ought to be, that all  appeals  raising
     issues under Directive 2004/38/EC and decided after 30 April 2006  are
     to be decided under the provisions of that Directive as implemented by
     the Regulations.

 21. The notices of decision in the present appeals  are  both  in  similar
     form.  Each recites the  appellant's  conviction  of  an  offence  and
     indicates that the Secretary of State is satisfied that the  appellant
     "would pose a threat to the requirements of public policy  if  allowed
     to remain in the United Kingdom "and that  in view of this  conviction
     the Secretary of State deems it to be conducive to the public good  to
     make a deportation order against you".  The decision to make  such  an
     order  by virtue of section 3(5)(a) of the 1971 Act and  the  proposal
     to give directions for the  appellant's  removal  to  his  country  of
     nationality follow.

 22. Each of the appellants  has  appealed  on  the  grounds  specified  in
     section 84 (1)(d).

 23. Give that the decisions are avowedly made under the  1971  Act  rather
     that  the  Regulations,  the  question  may  be  asked  whether  these
     decisions are in truth "EEA decisions", defined in Regulation 2 as  "a
     decision under these Regulations."  We are confident  that  these  are
     EEA decisions.  The reasoning is as follows.

 24. First, the  Directive,  and  the  Regulations  implementing  it,  give
     substantive rights to EEA nationals.  One of those rights is the right
     of a person otherwise entitled to reside in the UK not to  be  removed
     save in circumstances permitted by the Directive and regulation 19(3).
      Secondly, Regulation 24 applies to all decisions to remove  that  are
     made "in accordance with regulation 19(3)".  Thirdly, any decision  to
     remove an EEA national with a right  of  residence  that  was  not  in
     accordance with regulation 19(3) would be unlawful, so  regulation  24
     applies to all decisions to remove an EEA national  with  a  right  of
     residence.  Fourthly, given that regulation 24 applies,  the  decision
     is a decision under (not merely in accordance  with)  the  regulations
     even if (by virtue of Regulation 24(3)) it is worded as  if  the  1971
     Act , with no intrusion of EU law, were the empowering provision.

 25. (If it were to be said (which in these cases it  has  not  been)  that
     decisions phrased in this way are not "EEA decisions", there would  be
     no difference in substance, because in that case the  Directive  would
     have direct effect on these cases and the terms of Articles 27 and 28,
     which are for all practical purposes the same as those of  regulations
     19 and 21 would apply and achieve the same result as if the  decisions
     were "EEA decisions" governed by the Regulations.  We should add  that
     the reasoning in  the  previous  paragraph  is  not  affected  by  the
     consideration that the present decisions  were  made  before  the  new
     Regulations came into force  because  the  2000  Regulations  had,  in
     regulations  2,  21(3)  and  26,  provisions  identical  to  those  in
     regulations 2, 19(3) and 24 to which we refer there.)

 26. These appeals are undoubtedly to be considered within the calculus  of
     removals for which provision is  made  in  the  new  Regulations.   We
     remind ourselves that under those Regulations an EEA national who  has
     a permanent right  of residence in the United Kingdom can  be  removed
     only on "serious grounds of public policy or public security"; if  the
     EEA national is under the age of eighteen or has resided in the United
     Kingdom for more than ten years he can be removed only on  "imperative
     grounds of public security".  The meaning of the last  phrase  is  not
     absolutely clear.  What is clear is that the ground for  removing  any
     EEA national with a right of residence is more strongly expressed than
     it was under the previous regulations, by the insertion  of  the  word
     "serious" before "grounds".  Further, in the case of a minor or a long-
     term resident even serious grounds  are  not  enough  and  no  grounds
     merely of public policy are enough.  The word  of  intensification  is
     "imperative" and the grounds must be grounds of "public security".  At
     he hearing, Mr Montilla indicated that his instructions were that  the
     phrase "imperative grounds of public security" was a reference to  the
     commission or suspicion of commission of terrorist offences.   It  may
     well be that that is what is intended by that phrase  in  the  English
     version of the Directive and in the Regulations, bearing in  mind  the
     similar specialised meaning that  "security"  has  in  the  1971  (and
     subsequent) Acts. Whether or not that is so, we do not think  that  it
     is a phrase which is appropriate to cover the ordinary risk to society
     arising from  the  commission  of  further  offences  by  a  convicted
     criminal.  That is the risk which has in the past been met by  removal
     decisions based on grounds of "public policy".

 27. Where regulation 21(3) applies to an individual (because he is an  EEA
     national with a right of residence, but not a minor  or  a  long  term
     resident) he may be removed as previously on the grounds that there is
     a risk of his committing further offences, with the proviso  that  the
     risk of harm must now constitute serious grounds of public policy  for
     his removal.  Where regulation  21(4)  applies,  (that  is  where  the
     individual is a minor or a long-term resident)  the  ground  must  now
     evidently be both qualitatively and quantitatively more  serious.   We
     therefore doubt whether the words in question are intended to apply in
     any general sense to even a serious risk of  the  commission  of  even
     quite serious criminal offences.

 28. The first appellant was convicted of robbery at Warwick Crown Court on
     23 January 2001.  The Immigration Judge records in  his  determination
     as follows:

           "15.  In carrying out he balancing exercise which applies I have
           looked first at the circumstances of the offence for  which  the
           Appellant was imprisoned.  In his sentencing remarks Mr. Justice
           Goldring said
                 'as you now appreciate, you became involved  in  a  serious
                 robbery. In the middle of the afternoon  you  went  into  a
                 shop: you were armed with a steak knife; you threatened the
                 shopkeeper with it; you took money.  I accept that you were
                 drunk.  The effect on the shopkeeper has been considerable.
                  She says in  her  statement  "I  feel  this  incident  has
                 changed my life and that I now lack confidence".'
           16. The pre-sentence report made reference  to  the  Appellant's
           military service career  including two tours of duty in  Lebanon
           with the UN Peacekeeping Force, but reference was also  made  to
           the Appellant's problems relating to  alcohol  abuse  which  had
           contributed to the breakdown of his marriage and difficulties in
           other  personal  relationships.   The  probation   officer   who
           prepared the report assessed he risk of re-  offending  as  low.
           However, the pattern of offending, starting late but progressing
           swiftly to the current serious offence was a cause for  concern.
           The probation concluded that if  the  Appellant  was  indeed  to
           benefit from the inevitable prison term he would need to serve a
           fairly  substantial  term.,  enabling  him  to  get  access   to
           sustained  help.   It  was  against  that  background  that  the
           Appellant was sentenced to 4 � years.
           ...
           18.  I note that the Appellant has been granted early release on
           licence on two occasions but on each occasion he broke the terms
           of his licence and was returned to prison.
           ...
           21. It appears that the Appellant  has  behaved  well  while  in
           prison.
           ...
           He has a good attendance record  and  has  developed  very  good
           relationships with PE staff and other gym users.
           ...
           The Appellant is described as punctual, polite and courteous and
           is  enthusiastic  and  well  motivated.   He  acts  on  his  own
           initiative ensuring that facility areas and equipment is working
           effectively.
           ...
           23. I formed the view that the Appellant  has  a  clear  insight
           into his drink related problems which he was  perfectly  willing
           to  acknowledge.    During   cross-examination   the   Appellant
           acknowledged  that  all  his  problems  were  due  to  excessive
           drinking.  He said that drinking would conflict with his fitness
           training and  that  he  was  determined  to  take  advantage  of
           whatever  help  was  available  to  ensure  that  there  was  no
           repetition.  The Appellant said that he had receive considerable
           assistance from a counsellor while in prison.  He said upon  his
           release he would go to Alcoholics Anonymous  for  help  if  that
           were necessary and that he was determined not to return  to  his
           former ways.
           ...
           26. I am satisfied from all the evidence which I heard and  read
           that the Appellant is motivated to lead an industrious and crime
           free life  on  his  return  from  prison.   A  great  deal  will
           undoubtedly depend on his ability to refrain from alcohol  abuse
           but I am satisfied that there are good reasons to  suppose  that
           the Appellant has both the motivation and the ability to  obtain
           and  professional help in order to obviate any risk  that  might
           exist.

 29.  The  Immigration  Judge  thus  allowed  the  appeal  under  the  2000
     Regulations.  In our view he was entirely right to do so.  Removal  of
     an EEA national is not to be based on past conduct but on future risk,
     and, given his findings  as  to  the  risk  of  re-offending  and  the
     intention to keep away from alcohol any decision to the contrary would
     probably have been perverse.

 30. In this reconsideration we apply the 2006 Regulations, under which the
     Immigration Judge's decision is, if anything,  even  less  subject  to
     challenge.  Applying the principles set out  in  regulation  21(5)  it
     would be  impossible  to  say  that  the  appellant's  deportation  is
     justified on "serious grounds of public policy or public security".

 31. The second appellant came to the  United  Kingdom  to  live  with  her
     mother in 1993, when she was nine years old.  She  has  been  resident
     here ever since.  In April  2002  she  was  convicted  an  offence  of
     importation of class A drugs and was sentenced to  eight  and  a  half
     years imprisonment.  The Secretary of State's letter dated 23 November
     2005 challenges the appellant's account of her residence in the United
     Kingdom, but it is no longer suggested on the respondent's behalf that
     she has not been resident here since 1993 or 1994.  The letter goes on
     to say:

           "Although there is no clear evidence that  you  will  re-offend,
           the offence for which you have been convicted is  considered  to
           constitute a threat to the requirements of public policy on  the
           basis of conduct alone."


 32. The Immigration Judge indicated, in a short  determination,  that  she
     was satisfied that the appellant would not commit any further offences
     and allowed the appeal because she considered that:


           "there is no likelihood she will commit further offences  or  in
           some other way infringe public security or policy".


 33. The Secretary of State's grounds for reconsideration  cite  Bouchereau
     and Marchon and assert that the severity of the offence was sufficient
     to warrant a deportation order, particularly because it was an offence
     related to drugs.  We have  to  say  that  we  should  have  had  some
     concerns about the Immigration Judge's decision if it had not been for
     the coming into force of the new Regulations.

 34. Under those  Regulations,  however,  an  EEA  national  who  has  been
     resident in the United Kingdom for ten years or  is  a  minor  can  be
     removed  only  on  "imperative  grounds  of  public  security".    The
     appellant is no longer a minor (although she was  when  she  committed
     the offence for which she was convicted).  Her residence in the United
     Kingdom has partly been in prison, but there is  no  doubt  that  that
     constitutes "residence" for the purposes of the Regulations.  The test
     of "imperative grounds of public security"  is  at  the  very  highest
     level of the calculus introduced by the 2006 Regulations and Directive
     2004/38/EC.  There are no such grounds justifying the removal of  this
     appellant.  Any error made by the Immigration  Judge  was  accordingly
     not material.

 35. For the forgoing reasons we affirm the Immigration Judge's decision in
     each case.
