Anonymity

Rule 14: The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
An anonymity order  was  made  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  when  granting
permission to appeal. For reasons which are contained  within  our  decision
below, we consider it is appropriate to  continue  that  order.  Unless  and
until a Tribunal or  court  directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is  granted
anonymity. No report of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or  indirectly
identify him or any member of his family. This  direction  applies,  amongst
others, to both parties. Failure to comply with this  direction  could  lead
to contempt of court proceedings.

                            DECISION AND REASONS

    BACKGROUND

 1. Both members of the panel have contributed to this decision.

 2. The Appellant appeals against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge
    Mark Eldridge promulgated on 31 October 2019 ("the Decision").  By  the
    Decision, the  Judge  dismissed  the  Appellant's  appeal  against  the
    Respondent's decision dated 18 June  2019  refusing  his  human  rights
    claim in the context of a decision  to  deport  him  to  Jamaica  as  a
    persistent offender.

 3. The Appellant was born in 1999. He is currently aged twenty-one  years.
    He came to the UK with indefinite leave to enter  in  2011  (then  aged
    eleven years) to join his mother and stepfather. His mother  thereafter
    physically abused him, and he suffered sexual abuse at the hands of one
    of her friends (although the Appellant  is  reluctant  to  discuss  the
    detail of either experience). The Appellant's mother ejected  him  from
    the family home when he was about thirteen years old.

 4. The Appellant attributes the  abuse  by  his  mother  to  him  resuming
    contact with his biological father. His father left Jamaica immediately
    after the Appellant's birth and the Appellant did not see him until  he
    was aged about seven or eight years old when  his  father  returned  to
    that country. The Appellant's mother's  family  tried  to  prevent  the
    Appellant having contact with his father, but the Appellant  says  that
    he saw his father quite regularly after their first meeting in  Jamaica
    until he was brought to the UK.

 5. After the Appellant was excluded from his mother's home, he called  his
    father (who had by then returned to the UK) and went to live  with  his
    father in London. The Appellant's mother involved  the  police  as  she
    said that the Appellant's father had kidnapped him. It is at that stage
    that social services first became involved and the physical  abuse  was
    discovered.

 6. The Appellant was out of school for a year after he came to London as a
    space could not be found at a local school. He was then found  a  place
    at a Pupil Referral Unit in September 2014. The Appellant blames  those
    with whom he associated at that Unit for the fact that he then  started
    to get into trouble. He says that he was at risk from gangs and he  was
    stabbed on one occasion. Whilst the Appellant's father tried to  instil
    discipline, he failed and the Appellant's relationship with his  father
    deteriorated because the Appellant thought him too strict.

 7. The Appellant's father handed him over  to  social  services  when  the
    Appellant was aged  sixteen  years  because  he  could  not  cope.  The
    Appellant was placed into social  services  care  and  lived  in  semi-
    independent accommodation. Although the Appellant is now an  adult,  he
    remains subject to leaving care assistance until he is aged twenty-five
    years due to the age he was when he went into care.

 8. The Appellant was able to find a job in the summer of 2016.  In  August
    2016, he was stabbed again and hospitalised, so he was unable  to  work
    for a while.

 9. The Appellant has committed a number of offences starting at the age of
    thirteen years. He was convicted in 2016 of possession of  a  knife  or
    blade or sharply pointed article in a public place. He was sentenced to
    a Detention and Training Order for twelve  months  and  forfeiture  and
    destruction of the knife. In January 2017, he was convicted of robbery,
    possession of an offensive weapon in a public place and possession of a
    knife or blade or  sharply  pointed  article  in  a  public  place  and
    sentenced to a Detention and  Training  Order  for  twelve  months  and
    forfeiture and destruction of the bladed articles.  In  November  2017,
    the Appellant was convicted of two counts of assault on a constable and
    racially/religiously aggravated intention to cause harassment, alarm or
    distress and was sentenced to a Detention and Training  order  for  two
    months with two months concurrent and a Community  Order.  In  February
    2018, the Appellant  was  convicted  of  failing  to  comply  with  the
    Community Order. He was convicted of the same offence in December 2018,
    the order was revoked, and he was  made  subject  to  a  Detention  and
    Training Order of four months.

10. On his own admission, the Appellant continues to  smoke  cannabis.  The
    Appellant has been assessed as having symptoms of post-traumatic stress
    disorder ("PTSD") and depression. Having formed such  opinion  his  own
    expert assessed the risk which the Appellant poses and  concluded  that
    he poses a moderate risk of violent offending and a  moderate  risk  of
    causing serious harm.

11. Judge Eldridge accepted the Respondent's conclusion that the  Appellant
    is a persistent offender. It was accepted that the Appellant could  not
    succeed under the Immigration Rules ("the Rules") based on  his  family
    life. He has  no  partner  or  child.  The  Judge  concluded  that  the
    Appellant did not have  a  family  life  with  his  relatives  for  the
    purposes of an  assessment  outside  the  Rules.  In  relation  to  the
    Appellant's private life, the Judge found that the Appellant could  not
    succeed within the Rules as he has not been in the UK lawfully for more
    than half of his life. In any  event,  the  Judge  concluded  that  the
    Appellant is not socially  and  culturally  integrated.  Balancing  the
    interference with the  Appellant's  private  life  against  the  public
    interest, the Judge found that the Respondent's decision to deport  was
    proportionate and accordingly dismissed the appeal.

12. The Appellant appeals the Decision on five grounds which are, in  short
    summary, as follows:

         Ground 1: The Judge failed to give adequate reasons for refusing to
         make an anonymity order  or  failed  to  have  regard  to  material
         considerations when refusing that application.

         Ground 2: The Judge failed to deal with the Appellant's submissions
         regarding the applicability  of  Articles  39  and  40  of  the  UN
         Convention on the Rights of the Child ("UNCRC").

         Ground 3: The Judge failed to take into account material  evidence,
         reached findings  inconsistent  with  the  evidence  or  failed  to
         provide adequate reasons for rejecting evidence in relation to  the
         following:

             (i) Finding that the Appellant "is  not  on  any  recognisable
             journey  of  rehabilitation  at  this  stage"  ([55]  of   the
             Decision)

             (ii) Finding  that  the  Appellant  has  shown  "disdain"  for
             opportunities offered to him to deal with  his  mental  health
             issues ([54] of the Decision).

             (iii)  Finding  that  the  Appellant  would  not  be  "without
             practical support" in Jamaica ([56] of the Decision).

         Ground 4: The Judge failed to carry out a  holistic  assessment  or
         had regard to immaterial considerations when  concluding  that  the
         Appellant is not socially and culturally integrated in the UK.

         Ground 5: The Judge erred in his conclusion that the Appellant does
         not enjoy family life with his relatives by misdirecting himself in
         law and/or failing to have regard to material  evidence  or  making
         findings which are inconsistent with that evidence. It is said that
         the Judge's conclusion in this regard is perverse.

13. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Landes on
    14 February 2020 in the following terms so far as relevant:

         "... 2. It is arguable as set out at ground 2 that the judge failed
         to determine the submissions relying upon Articles 39 and 40 of the
         Convention on the Rights of the Child. I can trace no reference  to
         those submissions or any obvious indication  that  they  have  been
         taken into account.

         3. It is also arguable (ground 3) that the  judge  failed  to  give
         adequate reasons for concluding that the appellant was not  on  any
         recognisable journey of rehabilitation given the  evidence  of  the
         social worker about the appellant seeking to change his  behaviour.
         It is not clear to me however that the judge was  saying  that  the
         appellant had a current disdain for mental health  referrals.  This
         is because in the next sentence he concludes "even now, .... he  is
         ambivalent about seeking any therapy". That suggests a past disdain
         and a current ambivalence rather than a current disdain.

         4. I do not consider that the judge failed to give adequate reasons
         for his  conclusion  that  there  would  be  practical  support  in
         Jamaica. His grandmother visits Jamaica regularly and at the moment
         there are other family members there; no reason was given  for  the
         claimed hostility of the great-grandmother.

         5. I also consider it arguable (ground 4) that the  judge  did  not
         conduct a holistic assessment  as  to  whether  the  appellant  was
         socially and culturally integrated into the UK.

         6. So far as family life is concerned, the judge explained that the
         appellant was not living with family members  since  he  was  taken
         into care in early 2016 and he did not  receive  practical  support
         from any of the three family members relied upon. I  consider  that
         the judge was entitled to conclude that  the  appellant  and  those
         family members did not enjoy family life together.

         7. Despite my comments I do not restrict the grounds which  may  be
         argued.

         8. I make an anonymity direction for the moment bearing in mind the
         terms of ground 1. Of course, it will be for the Upper Tribunal  to
         decide whether that direction is to continue".

14. The Respondent filed a Rule 24 Reply on 30 March 2020 seeking to uphold
    the Decision. We were also provided with an Appellant's bundle for  the
    hearing which included Mr Chirico's skeleton argument  for  the  First-
    tier Tribunal hearing and a Note of Oral  Submissions  prepared  by  Mr
    Chirico for the hearing before us.

15. The hearing before us was conducted via Skype for Business. There  were
    no technical difficulties and both parties  confirmed  that  they  were
    able to follow the proceedings throughout.

16. The matter comes before us to determine whether the  Decision  contains
    an error of law and, if we so conclude, to either re-make the  decision
    or remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal to do so.

    DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

17. We deal with the grounds as pleaded and developed by Mr Chirico in oral
    argument. However, for reasons which we give below, we have taken those
    in a slightly different order.

    Ground 1

18. Mr Chirico fairly and correctly conceded  that  the  Appellant's  first
    ground could not be utilised to establish  any  error  of  law  in  the
    Decision. This is not a case which was pursued  on  the  basis  of  any
    individualised risk to the Appellant in Jamaica which it is said  would
    be exacerbated by the failure to make an anonymity direction. The basis
    on which it is said that an anonymity direction should be made  relates
    to the sensitivity of some of the issues, particularly related  to  the
    Appellant's family background and history.

19. The Judge dealt with the anonymity direction at [61] of the Decision in
    the following terms:

         "So far as I am aware there  has  never  been  an  order  in  place
         preserving  the  Appellant's  anonymity  at  any  stage  of   these
         proceedings. I do not consider it is appropriate to  make  such  an
         order now and I do not."

20. Whilst that passage is devoid of reasons for not  making  an  anonymity
    direction, whether such a direction is appropriate is largely a  matter
    of judicial discretion. As appears from [14] of the Decision, the Judge
    did agree to treat the Appellant as a vulnerable witness on  the  basis
    of the sensitivity of the issues in this case.

21. As we note above, Judge Landes ordered anonymity on  an  interim  basis
    when granting permission. Although we are acutely aware of the  general
    principle of open justice, that is to be balanced in appropriate  cases
    against the interference with the individual's  right  to  privacy.  We
    make clear that, in this case, the individual rights of  the  Appellant
    are based only on the sensitivity of his past family  life  and  events
    which befell him as a  child.  They  do  not  include  the  Appellant's
    interests in keeping private his criminal offending. Even  though  some
    or most of those offences were committed before the Appellant  attained
    his  majority,  we  do  not  order  anonymity  so  as  to  prevent  the
    Appellant's commission of those offences being disclosed. We do so only
    to protect the Appellant's privacy in relation to the events  which  we
    record at [3] above. Mr  Lindsay  indicated  that  the  Respondent  was
    neutral in relation to this matter.

22. Having continued the interim anonymity order for the  purposes  of  the
    ongoing appeal, we need say no more about the first ground. That is now
    academic.

    Ground 2

23. It was unclear to us at the outset of this hearing  how  the  Appellant
    puts his case in relation to Articles 39 and 40 of UNCRC. We accept  as
    did Mr Lindsay that the Judge did not deal with this argument which  we
    accept appears in Mr Chirico's skeleton  argument  for  the  First-tier
    Tribunal hearing at [36] to [48] of that document. As such, there is an
    error of law in failing to deal with an argument put forward. The  real
    issue which arises in relation to this ground is whether  the  argument
    is one which is capable of making any difference to  the  outcome.  For
    that reason, we propose to return to this ground after dealing with the
    other remaining grounds.

    Ground 3

24. By means of this ground of claim the Appellant raises three  individual
    challenges that are linked by the assertion  that  the  Judge  Eldridge
    made findings inconsistent with the evidence before him.

25. The Appellant complains about what is said to be a stark  finding  that
    he 'is not on any recognisable journey of rehabilitation'  at  [55]  of
    the Decision. It is  appropriate  to  consider  the  paragraph  in  its
    entirety:

         '55. It must be accepted  that  the  majority  of  the  Appellant's
             offending occurred whilst he was under the age of 18  but  the
             factors which I have indicated, the risk he continues to  pose
             of serious offending, the spurning of treatment  proposed  and
             offered, and the nature of his offending leads me to  conclude
             that he continues to pose a real threat  of  conduct  such  as
             carrying bladed instruments and violent offending. The  public
             interest in his removal by way of deportation  is  very  high.
             With the attitude he has shown  to  community  sentences,  the
             fact that he has disappeared at times whilst under the care of
             social services and, to a limited extent, his continuing on  a
             daily basis to flout the criminal law through his  drug  habit
             lead me to conclude that he is not on any recognisable journey
             of rehabilitation at this stage.'

             [our emphasis]

26. Mr Chirico submitted that the Judge  had  failed  to  factor  into  his
    assessment the unchallenged evidence of  Mr  Huntley,  the  Appellant's
    social worker, that the Appellant was trying to  change  his  behaviour
    and such attitude was evidenced by his engagement both with Mr  Huntley
    and his probation officer though his  attending  all  appointments  and
    being keen to look for work. Such evidence  was  said  to  be  directly
    incompatible with the conclusion that  the  Appellant  is  not  on  any
    recognisable journey of rehabilitation.

27. We are satisfied  that  the  Judge  took  Mr  Huntley's  evidence  into
    account. Indeed, the Judge expressly noted as part of  his  assessment,
    at [49] of the Decision that Mr Huntley was a disinterested expert  who
    had worked with the Appellant throughout 2019, seeing  him  on  several
    occasions, and that Mr. Huntley  spoke  of  the  Appellant  "trying  to
    change his  behaviour  and  now  being  engaged  with  probation"  (our
    emphasis). It was a matter for  the  Judge  to  consider  the  evidence
    relied upon by the Appellant in the round and it was reasonably open to
    him  to  prefer  the  evidence  of  Dr  Davies,   Consultant   Forensic
    Psychologist (the Appellant's own expert). At  [50]  consideration  was
    given to Dr Davies' assessment that the Appellant was a  moderate  risk
    of further violent offending and a moderate risk of  serious  harm  and
    was "currently ambivalent as to therapy" (our emphasis).

28. Mr Chirico further submitted that in  reaching  his  conclusion  as  to
    rehabilitation, the Judge failed to consider the  Appellant's  evidence
    that he  used  cannabis  as  a  form  of  coping  'until  he  gets  the
    opportunity to go to work and make something of [him]self'. We  observe
    that the Judge considered the Appellant's evidence and was entitled  to
    place weight upon his confirmation to  Dr  Davies,  as  detailed  in  a
    report authored the week before the hearing,  that  he  was  ambivalent
    about seeking any therapy that was offered to  him.  We  are  satisfied
    that the Appellant's illicit drug use could properly  be  seen  by  the
    Judge as a choice or habit that he was  content  to  engage  in  whilst
    being aware that it was a criminal act.

29. Further, the Judge was lawfully entitled to conclude  on  the  evidence
    before him that the Appellant remained a moderate (or medium)  risk  of
    both further violent offending and of serious harm  to  others  in  the
    community, as  confirmed  by  Dr  Davies  and  the  general  assessment
    contained within the OASys report.  Consideration of such risk was part
    and parcel of the assessment of rehabilitation.

30. The Judge did not treat past events and action as  indicative  of  risk
    and  rehabilitation  but  looked  at  them  in  conjunction  with   the
    Appellant's ongoing limited  engagement  with  offers  of  support  and
    treatment. In the circumstances we are satisfied that  the  Judge  took
    all relevant factors into account when concluding  that  the  Appellant
    was not on any recognisable journey of rehabilitation at  the  time  of
    his Decision.

31. The Appellant's second complaint concerns the Judge's finding, at [54],
    that he has shown a disdain for the opportunities  offered  to  him  in
    terms of mental health referrals. By means of his grounds of appeal, Mr
    Chirico asserted at �24 that 'the FTT's position is plainly  that  [the
    Appellant] has, through his own fault, failed to obtain  mental  health
    support'  and  that  such  conclusion  failed  to   engage   with   the
    difficulties that the Appellant might face in approaching mental health
    professionals consequent to his history of abuse.

32. We observe the relevant paragraph:

         '54.  I  am  concerned  that  he  has  shown  a  disdain  for   the
             opportunities  offered  to  him  in  terms  of  mental  health
             referrals and, above all, court  orders  that  were  aimed  at
             rehabilitation within the community. Even  now,  talking  with
             Ms. Davies, he is ambivalent about seeking  any  therapy  that
             might be offered to him. He has to be seen on the basis of the
             expert evidence available to me to be at least a  medium  risk
             of reoffending and a medium risk of causing  serious  harm  to
             members  of  the  public.  These  are  important  factors   in
             ascertaining the interests of the state.'

             [our emphasis]

33. Before us Mr Chirico accepted from the outset that the  Judge  had  not
    concluded that the Appellant has a current disdain  for  mental  health
    referrals. Rather, upon reading [54] in its entirety, he submitted that
    the  Judge  found  a  past  disdain  and  a  current  ambivalence.  His
    submission was that the Judge failed to take into  account  the  reason
    for the Appellant's failure to take offered medical support, which lies
    in his history of abuse, and that the use  of  'disdain'  placed  blame
    upon a victim of abuse.

34. We find that when read as a whole, [54] the "disdain"  is  identifiable
    as mainly directed towards the Appellant's  attitude  to  court  orders
    that were aimed at  supporting  his  rehabilitation  and  his  lack  of
    engagement with them.  If and insofar as the Judge placed weight on the
    Appellant's failure to engage in  the  past  or  now  with  therapy  to
    address his difficulties, we accept that the use of the word  "disdain"
    may be an unfortunate one.   However,  the  broad  point  is  that  the
    Appellant  was  and  is  unwilling  to  engage  with  the  pathways  to
    rehabilitation that have been offered to  him,  whatever  his  reasons.
    That was a matter on which the Judge was entitled to place weight.

35. The Appellant further complains that the Judge erred in concluding that
    he would enjoy practical support upon return to Jamaica  as  there  was
    evidence before the Judge that  his  great-grandmother  and  his  half-
    sister are unable to offer him  any  ongoing  support.  Before  us,  Mr
    Chirico acknowledged that this was not the strongest point advanced  on
    behalf of the Appellant.

36. The Judge addressed this issue  at  [56]  and  [59]  of  the  Decision,
    observing that the Appellant's  grandmother  had  visited  Jamaica  for
    between six weeks and four months  in  recent  times  and  that  family
    members in this country were willing to support him on  his  return  to
    Jamaica, including his father.

37. We observe that the support available on return does  not  have  to  be
    extensive and are satisfied that the Judge appropriately considered the
    nature and substance of the  support  available  to  the  Appellant  on
    return. He was not required to detail the persons unable to offer  such
    support within his Decision. He only needed  to  be  satisfied  to  the
    appropriate standard that such support was available.  The  finding  he
    reached was one which was open to him on the evidence.

38. For the foregoing reasons, we are satisfied that there is no  error  of
    law disclosed under any of the heads of the third ground.

    Ground 4

39. The Appellant complains by means of this ground that in concluding that
    he is not 'socially and culturally  integrated'  in  this  country  the
    Judge failed to conduct a holistic assessment and further had regard to
    immaterial considerations. The  Judge  addressed  social  and  cultural
    integration at [41] of the Decision:

         '41. Even if that had been incorrect, I would not have  found  that
             the Appellant was socially and culturally  integrated  in  the
             United Kingdom. In my judgement carrying  bladed  instruments,
             committing offences of robbery, assaulting police officers  in
             the execution of their duty and daily use of proscribed  drugs
             does not show such integration. In  the  decision  in  Binbuga
             cultural and social integration was described at paragraph  56
             of the judgment of Hamblen  LJ  as  'the  extent  to  which  a
             foreign criminal has become  incorporated  within  the  lawful
             social structure of the UK'. He took this further in paragraph
             57 in describing it as 'the acceptance and assumption  by  the
             foreign criminal of the culture of the UK,  its  core  values,
             ideas, customs and social behaviour. This includes  acceptance
             of the principle of the rule of law.'

40. Mr Chirico submitted that the  Judge  took  a  reductive  and  unlawful
    approach by wholly failing  to  undertake  a  holistic  assessment  and
    instead exclusively referred to the Appellant's  criminal  conduct.  By
    adopting such approach, the Judge is said to have failed to have regard
    to several factors favourable to the Appellant, including his length of
    residence in this country, the  reasons  underpinning  his  criminality
    including his history of sexual and physical abuse,  and  the  positive
    evidence presented by Mr Huntley and Dr Davies.

41. The Appellant placed reliance on the Court of Appeal's judgment  in  CI
    (Nigeria) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department [2019] EWCA Civ
    2027 ("CI (Nigeria)") at [56] to [62].  The point there made is, as  we
    accept, that the nature and context of offending is only  one  part  of
    the overall issue of integration.

42. As the Court of Appeal held at [57] "it is important to  keep  in  mind
    that the rationale behind the test is to determine whether  the  person
    concerned has established  a  private  life  in  the  UK  which  has  a
    substantial claim to protection under Article 8".  The Court of  Appeal
    went  on  to  say  that  "[r]elevant  social  ties  obviously   include
    relationships with friends  and  relatives,  as  well  as  ties  formed
    through  employment  or  other  paid  or   unpaid   work   or   through
    participation in  communal  activities".   The  Court  of  Appeal  also
    pointed out though that integration as a concept is "constituted  at  a
    deep level by familiarity with and participation in the shared customs,
    traditions, practices, beliefs, values,  linguistic  idioms  and  other
    local knowledge which situate a person in a society or social group and
    generate a sense of belonging".

43. The first point we make is that what the Judge  says  at  [41]  of  the
    Decision has to be read in the context of the Decision as a whole.   In
    particular, the Judge had, at [34] to [39] of the Decision,  considered
    the extent of the Appellant's private life  and  family  relationships.
    He was aware that the Appellant has been present in this  country  from
    the age of eleven. He made findings on the Appellant's interaction with
    family members, and the emotional ties that he enjoyed with his father,
    sister and grandmother. He noted the support received by the  Appellant
    from Lambeth council.

44. However, he also observed records  from  Lambeth  that  identified  the
    Appellant as exhibiting very anti-social behaviour and  concerns  being
    raised  as  to  his  stalking  female  contemporaries.  He   took   the
    Appellant's criminal convictions and his  continuing  use  of  cannabis
    into account along with other relevant issues, as he  was  required  to
    do.

45. Paragraph [41] of the Decision therefore draws together  what  is  said
    about the Appellant's offending at [30] to [33] of the Decision against
    the Appellant's community ties at [34] to [39] of the Decision.

46. Second, that approach is underlined by the penultimate sentence of [41]
    of the Decision.  Although the Judge was there quoting from the case of
    Binbuga v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2019]  EWCA  Civ
    551, that sentence encapsulates the principles set out by the Court  of
    Appeal in CI (Nigeria).

47. For those reasons, we are satisfied that  the  Judge  did  undertake  a
    holistic assessment as to integration.

48. We add that, when considering the fact-sensitive nature of an Article 8
    assessment, the scenarios in CI (Nigeria) and Akinyemi v  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department (No.2) ("Akinyemi No 2") [2019] EWCA  Civ
    2098 do not assist the Appellant. In the former, the appellant  arrived
    in the United Kingdom when aged one. In the latter, the  appellant  was
    born in this country and had not left it. In this matter, the Appellant
    arrived in this country  when  aged  eleven  and  committed  his  first
    offence - battery, for which  he  received  a  reprimand  -  when  aged
    thirteen. By the age  of  fifteen  he  was  considered  by  persons  in
    authority to be a stalker and received his first conviction  when  aged
    seventeen in relation to the possession of a knife or blade or  sharply
    pointed article in a public place.

49. Having undertaken a holistic assessment, the Judge lawfully  determined
    that the Appellant was not socially and culturally integrated  in  this
    country and gave lawful reasons for so concluding.   There is no  error
    of law under this ground.

   Ground 5

50. Before the First-tier Tribunal the Appellant asserted that he enjoyed a
    family life with his sister, his father and his grandmother. The  Judge
    concluded that for the purposes of Article 8  a  family  life  was  not
    established between the Appellant and these relatives. The Judge  noted
    at [36] - [39] of the Decision that the Appellant  is  not  leading  an
    independent life because he remains in receipt of support from  Lambeth
    Council, but found that he does not receive any practical support  from
    his father, sister and grandmother. The Judge  found  that  whilst  the
    Appellant's sister has a sincere affection for him, they  enjoy  little
    contact and had not seen each other for a considerable period of  time.
    As to the Appellant and his father, they have  an  on-off  relationship
    and by the time of the hearing were seeing each other once a month. The
    Judge accepted that the Appellant's grandmother has  sincere  affection
    for the Appellant, but she has other relatives living with her for whom
    she was responsible.

51. The Judge concluded, at [39], that:

         '39. ... it is clear that the Appellant has many needs,  but  I  do
             not find that the nature of the relationship  on  a  practical
             level is that of family life between the Appellant and any  of
             the relatives he has relied upon. Emotional  support  will  be
             provided by his grandmother whenever possible and sometimes by
             his father but  I  do  not  consider  that  the  relationships
             between them amount of [sic] family life within the  terms  of
             Article 8 ...'

52. The Appellant's first complaint is that the Judge  erred  in  confining
    his assessment to the date of the hearing, a time when he was  required
    by bail conditions to reside with his uncle  in  Bournemouth,  as  such
    approach failed to engage with the positive obligation placed upon  the
    Respondent to ensure  respect  for  family  life.  Consequent  to  such
    positive  obligation,  the  Appellant  submitted  that  the  Judge  was
    required to examine the 'potential' for family life if his  appeal  was
    successful, thereby permitting the Appellant to return to London and be
    closer to his father, sister and grandmother.

53. The Court of Appeal confirmed in Singh v. Entry Clearance Officer,  New
    Delhi [2004] EWCA Civ  1075,  at  [38],  that  the  potential  for  the
    development of family life is relevant in  determining  whether  family
    life  already  exists.  In  this  matter,  the  Judge  was  considering
    circumstances  existing  between  the  Appellant  and  certain   family
    members, and he was entitled  to  place  into  his  assessment  of  the
    existence or otherwise of family life the fact that the Appellant  left
    the family home in 2016 and having been  placed  into  local  authority
    care was living semi-independently.

54. The evidence confirmed that the Appellant had  not  received  practical
    support from his father, sister and grandmother for  significant  time,
    nor did the evidence before the Judge identify a likelihood  as  to  an
    increase in practical support provided by family  members  towards  the
    Appellant at a future time.

55. We note that the Appellant and his family members  sought  to  identify
    the strength of their emotional ties, with  the  Appellant  referencing
    his enjoyment of being able to get things of his chest when  he  visits
    his father and the enjoyment of being  able  to  pop  in  and  see  his
    grandmother.

56. We are satisfied however that the Judge considered the  family  dynamic
    as detailed before him and was mindful that considerations of Article 8
    rights are fact sensitive when he concluded that family  life  did  not
    exist between the Appellant and identified family members at  the  date
    of his decision. Further, observing the evidence of  emotional  support
    advanced by the Appellant the Judge proceeded to  consider  'potential'
    development at [39], concluding that such support would be provided  by
    his grandmother 'whenever possible' and 'sometimes' by his father,  but
    such support was not capable of establishing  a  family  life  for  the
    purpose of article 8. Such assessment is consistent with  the  approach
    confirmed by the Court of Appeal in Kugathas v. Secretary of State  for
    the Home Department [2003] EWCA Civ 31, that a finding of  family  life
    between adults requires more than the normal emotional ties.

57. For those reasons, we can discern no  error  of  law  under  the  fifth
    ground.

    Ground 2 revisited

58. We have concluded that there is  no  error  of  law  disclosed  by  the
    Appellant's grounds 3, 4 and 5. However, as we accepted at [23]  above,
    ground 2 does disclose an error in relation to the Judge's  failure  to
    deal with the Appellant's arguments regarding Articles 39 and 40 UNCRC.
    As we there indicated, the question which now arises  is  whether  that
    argument is one which is capable  of  affecting  the  outcome  of  this
    appeal or whether, as we have concluded, for reasons set out below, the
    argument is one which, had it  been  considered,  would  have  made  no
    difference.

59. We initially understood from his skeleton argument that Mr Chirico  was
    seeking to place direct reliance on an instrument of international  law
    which, so far as we could ascertain, has  not  been  incorporated  into
    domestic law  (at  least  so  far  as  the  articles  relied  upon  are
    concerned). Mr Chirico confirmed however that this is not  the  way  in
    which the case is put. He accepted that  the  Tribunal  could  not  and
    should not seek  to  interpret  or  apply  Articles  39  and  40  UNCRC
    directly.

60. The way in which Mr Chirico seeks to place reliance on Articles 39  and
    40 is as follows. The Supreme Court in Hesham Ali (Iraq) v Secretary of
    State for the Home Department [2016] UKSC 60 "reaffirmed ...  the  need
    for  domestic  decision-makers  to  be   guided   by   the   Strasbourg
    jurisprudence". The Tribunal is of course also  obliged  by  the  Human
    Rights Act 1998 to have regard to the case-law of the Strasbourg court.

61. Next, Mr Chirico draws attention to the  Strasbourg  cases  of  Uner  v
    Netherlands (Application No. 46410/99, 18 October 2006) particularly as
    reaffirmed in Maslov v Austria  (Application  1638/03,  23  June  2008)
    ("Maslov"). Mr Chirico relies in particular on  paragraphs  [73],  [75]
    and [82] of the Grand  Chamber's  judgment  which  he  submits  provide
    general guidance about the  principles  to  be  applied  in  Article  8
    deportation cases. Those include in particular the obligation  to  have
    regard to the best interests of the child in any case where the  person
    to be expelled is still a minor or "the reason for the  expulsion  lies
    in offences committed when a minor" ([82] of the judgment  in  Maslov).
    This obligation is, says  Mr  Chirico,  derived  from  the  UNCRC  (see
    reference at [82] of the judgment to [36] where Article 40  is  cited).
    The Grand Chamber goes on at [83]  of  the  judgment  to  set  out  the
    relevance of Article 40 as follows:

         "The Court considers  that,  where  expulsion  measures  against  a
         juvenile offender are concerned, the obligation to  take  the  best
         interests of the child  into  account  includes  an  obligation  to
         facilitate his or her reintegration. In this connection, the  Court
         notes that Article 40 of the Convention on the Rights of the  Child
         makes reintegration an aim to be pursued by  the  juvenile  justice
         system (see paragraphs 36-38 above). In the Court's view  this  aim
         will not be achieved by severing  family  or  social  ties  through
         expulsion, which must remain a means of last resort in the case  of
         a juvenile offender..."

62. Based on this analysis, Mr Chirico concludes that Article 8 ECHR has to
    encompass consideration of the aim of Article 40 UNCRC  when  assessing
    the proportionality of the deportation of a person as the Appellant who
    has committed  crimes  whilst  still  a  child,  for  the  purposes  of
    facilitating reintegration (even where, as here, the  Appellant  is  no
    longer a child). His  submission  is  that,  in  a  similar  vein,  the
    Tribunal should have regard to Article 39 UNCRC even though he accepted
    that there is  no  express  reference  to  that  article  made  by  the
    Strasbourg court in Maslov or any other case.

63. Particularly in relation to Article 40 UNCRC, as we canvassed  with  Mr
    Chirico, we were unable to understand how his submission amounts to any
    more than a development of an argument that the  Tribunal  should  take
    into account the guidance in Maslov insofar as that is relevant to this
    case. We will come to the relevance of the judgment in that case below.

64. We begin our analysis however by setting out articles 39 and  40  UNCRC
    which read as follows:

         "Article 39

         States Parties shall  take  all  appropriate  measures  to  promote
         physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration  of  a
         child victim of: any  form  of  neglect,  exploitation,  or  abuse;
         torture or any other form of cruel, inhuman or degrading  treatment
         of  punishment;   or   armed   conflicts.   Such   recovering   and
         reintegration shall take place in an environment which fosters  the
         health, self-respect and dignity of the child.

         Article 40

         1. States Parties recognize the right of every  child  alleged  as,
         accused of, or recognized as having infringed the penal law  to  be
         treated in a manner consistent with the promotion  of  the  child's
         sense of dignity and worth, which reinforces  the  child's  respect
         for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of others  and  which
         takes  into  account  the  child's  age  and  the  desirability  of
         promoting the child's reintegration  and  the  child's  assuming  a
         constructive role in society.

         2. To this end, and having regard to  the  relevant  provisions  of
         international instruments, States  Parties  shall,  in  particular,
         ensure that:

             (a) No child shall be alleged as, be accused of, or recognized
             as having infringed  the  penal  law  by  reason  of  acts  or
             omissions  that   were   not   prohibited   by   national   or
             international law at the time they were committed;

             (b) Every child alleged as or accused of having infringed  the
             penal law has at least the following guarantees:

                  (i) To be presumed innocent until proven guilty  according
                  to law;

                  (ii) To be informed promptly and directly of  the  charges
                  against him or her, and, if appropriate,  through  his  or
                  her parents or legal guardians, and to have legal or other
                  appropriate assistance in the preparation and presentation
                  of his or her defence;

                  (iii) To have the matter determined  without  delay  by  a
                  competent, independent and impartial authority or judicial
                  body in a fair hearing according to law, in  the  presence
                  of legal or other appropriate assistance and, unless it is
                  considered not to be in the best interest of the child, in
                  particular,  taking  into  account  his  or  her  age   or
                  situation, his or her parents or legal guardians;

                  (iv) Not to be compelled to give testimony or  to  confess
                  guilt; to examine or have examined adverse  witnesses  and
                  to obtain the participation and examination  of  witnesses
                  on his or her behalf under conditions of equality;

                  (v) If considered to have infringed the penal law, to have
                  this decision and  any  measures  imposed  in  consequence
                  thereof reviewed by a higher  competent,  independent  and
                  impartial authority or judicial body according to law;

                  (vi) To have the free assistance of an interpreter if  the
                  child cannot understand or speak the language used;

                  (vii) To have his or her privacy fully  respected  at  all
                  stages of the proceedings.

         3. States Parties shall seek to promote the establishment of  laws,
         procedures, authorities and institutions specifically applicable to
         children alleged as, accused or, or recognized as having  infringed
         the penal law, and, in particular:

             (a) The establishment of a minimum age  below  which  children
             shall be presumed not to have the  capacity  to  infringe  the
             penal law;

             (b) Whenever appropriate and desirable, measures  for  dealing
             with such children without resorting to judicial  proceedings,
             providing that human rights and  legal  safeguards  are  fully
             respected.

         4.  A  variety  of  dispositions,  such  as  care,   guidance   and
         supervision orders; counselling; probation; foster care;  education
         and  vocational  training  programmes  and  other  alternatives  to
         institutional care shall be available to ensure that  children  are
         dealt  with  in  a  manner  appropriate  to  their  well-being  and
         proportionate both to their circumstances and the offence."

65. It goes without saying that the UNCRC is concerned  with  all  children
    which of  course  includes  non-national  minors.  It  is  however  not
    specifically targeted at  foreign  national  children  and  nor  is  it
    concerned generally with immigration. As  such,  whilst  we  accept  Mr
    Chirico's submission that the provisions of the UNCRC are addressed  to
    State Parties generally rather than any individual part of  the  State,
    the relevance of the individual provisions does rather  depend  on  the
    context to which that provision is directed. Although the Grand Chamber
    in Maslov confined itself to a citation of Article 40(1) UNCRC, we have
    set out the whole of Article 40 so that the  sub-article  can  also  be
    read in context.

66. As we set out at [60] to [62] above, Mr Chirico's argument in  relation
    to Article 40 turns on what is said by the Grand Chamber  at  [82]  and
    [83] of its judgment in Maslov. We note at this juncture that, although
    paragraph [83] does speak of reintegration in general terms and relates
    Article 40 to the need to integrate juvenile offenders in  the  context
    of deportation, that has to be read with what is said about Article  40
    earlier in the judgment as follows:

         "37. The Committee on the Rights of the Child,  in  its  concluding
         observations  on  the  second  periodic  report  of  Austria   (see
         CRC/C/15/Add 251, 31 March  2005  ��  53  and  54),  expressed  its
         concern about the increasing number of persons below the age of  18
         placed into detention, a measure disproportionately affecting those
         of foreign origin, and recommended with regard to Article 40 of the
         Convention on the Rights of the Child that appropriate measures  to
         promote  the  recovery  and  social  integration  involved  in  the
         juvenile justice system be taken.

         38. In its General Comment no. 10 (2007) on  children's  rights  in
         juvenile  justice  (see  CRC/C/GC/10,  25  April  2007,  �71),  the
         Committee on the Rights of the  Child  emphasised  with  regard  to
         measures in the sphere of juvenile justice:

             '... that the reaction to  an  offence  should  always  be  in
             proportion not only to the circumstances and  the  gravity  of
             the  offence,  but  also  to  the  age,  lesser   culpability,
             circumstances and needs of  the  child,  as  well  as  to  the
             various and particularly long-term needs  of  the  society.  A
             strictly punitive approach  is  not  in  accordance  with  the
             leading principles for juvenile justice spelled out in Article
             40�1 of CRC [Convention on the Rights of  the  Child]  ...  In
             cases of severe offences by children,  measures  proportionate
             to the circumstances of the offender and to the gravity of the
             offence may be considered,  including  considerations  of  the
             need of public safety and sanctions. In the case of  children,
             such considerations must always be outweighed by the  need  to
             safeguard the well-being and the best interests of  the  child
             and to promote his/her reintegration.'"

67. Before turning to the relevance of what is said in Maslov to this case,
    we make the following general observations.

68. First, as we have already noted, the legal system in the United Kingdom
    provides (in broad terms) that domestic courts are unable to adjudicate
    on rights arising in international law unless  those  are  incorporated
    into domestic legislation or are part of  customary  international  law
    (see JH Rayner (Mincing Lane) Ltd and others v. Department of Trade and
    Industry and Others - the "Tin Council" cases - [1990] 2 AC 418). As we
    have already noted, Mr Chirico did not disagree with that proposition.

69. Second, as we observed in the course of Mr Chirico's  submissions,  the
    Grand Chamber is part of a supranational court  which  itself  operates
    therefore on the international plane and  is  not  constrained  by  the
    doctrine of incorporation. As such, it is perhaps unsurprising that  it
    informs its judgments by reference to other international instruments.

70. Third, whilst  we  do  not  disagree  that  those  other  international
    instruments may  inform  human  rights  in  the  domestic  arena  where
    directly relevant, through the lens of Article 8  ECHR  and  Strasbourg
    cases, that cannot be used as some sort of  mechanism  to  apply  those
    rights directly in domestic law to avoid the need for incorporation and
    circumvent the doctrine.

71. Fourth, for that reason, the way in which the ECtHR  uses  those  other
    international instruments and relies upon  them  has  to  be  carefully
    considered in its context. As we have already said, the  UNCRC  is  not
    directly concerned with foreign national children nor  the  context  of
    immigration. What it has to say  about  the  rights  and  interests  of
    children may be relevant to a particular case, but the context  is  all
    important.

72. Turning then to the case of Maslov, we begin by summarising  the  facts
    of that case. The appellant in that case,  a  Bulgarian  national,  had
    entered Austria lawfully with his family in 1990 at the age of six.  He
    had remained lawfully  throughout.  His  parents  became  nationals  of
    Austria.  The   appellant   underwent   his   education   in   Austria.
    Notwithstanding a series of minor offences committed in 1998 (when  the
    appellant would have been aged about fourteen  or  fifteen  years),  in
    March 1999, he was given a permit to settle indefinitely in Austria. He
    was convicted some six months later of a number of  much  more  serious
    offences  committed  between  November  1998  and  June  1999.  He  was
    sentenced to a term of imprisonment  with  an  order  to  undergo  drug
    therapy. He was later convicted for further offences and sentenced to a
    term of further imprisonment. The appellant was made the subject of  an
    exclusion order in 2001 when he would have been  aged  about  seventeen
    years old. His appeal against exclusion relied on his  family  ties  as
    his entire family lived in Austria and although the  courts  had  noted
    the parents' inability to influence  the  appellant,  he  had  remained
    living with his family outside the  periods  of  imprisonment.  He  was
    still living with his family at the time of the exclusion order.

73. We have already set the reference to Article 40 UNCRC  in  its  context
    within the judgment at [66] above. As is there  evident,  that  article
    was particularly relevant in Maslov because of what had  been  said  by
    the Committee on the Rights of the  Child  about  Austria's  increasing
    practice of detaining those under eighteen. Those comments  related  of
    course to the juvenile criminal justice system as a whole, but  it  was
    noted that the  practice  had  a  disproportionate  effect  on  foreign
    nationals such as the appellant. Mr Maslov had been made subject to two
    fairly lengthy terms of imprisonment by the time  he  reached  eighteen
    years.

74. In order to understand  the  Grand  Chamber's  approach,  the  relevant
    starting point is [71] to [75] where the  Court  set  out  the  general
    principles which apply to cases such as Maslov as follows:

         "71. In a case like  the  present  one,  where  the  person  to  be
         expelled is a young adult who has not yet founded a family  of  his
         own, the relevant criteria are - the nature and seriousness of  the
         offence committed by the applicant; - the length of the applicant's
         stay in the country from which he or she is to be expelled;  -  the
         time elapsed since the offence was committed  and  the  applicant's
         conduct during that period; and - the solidity of social,  cultural
         and family ties with the host  country  and  with  the  country  of
         destination.

         72. The Court would  also  clarify  that  the  age  of  the  person
         concerned can play a role when applying some of the above criteria.
         For instance, when assessing the  nature  and  seriousness  of  the
         offences committed by an applicant, it has to be taken into account
         whether he or she committed them as a juvenile or as an adult...

         73. In turn, when assessing the length of the applicant's  stay  in
         the country from which he or she is to be expelled and the solidity
         of the social, cultural and family ties with the host  country,  it
         evidently makes a  difference  whether  the  person  concerned  had
         already come to the country during his or her childhood  or  youth,
         or was even born there, or whether  he  or  she  only  came  as  an
         adult...

         74. Although Article 8  provides  no  absolute  protection  against
         expulsion for any category of aliens (see Uner, cited above,  �55),
         including those who were born in the host country or moved there in
         their early childhood, the Court has already found that  regard  is
         to be had to the special situation of aliens who have  spent  most,
         if not all, of their childhood in the host country, were brought up
         there4 and received their education there (see Uner, �58 in fine).

         75. In short, the Court considers that for a  settled  migrant  who
         has lawfully spent all or the major part of his  or  her  childhood
         and youth in the host country very serious reasons are required  to
         justify expulsion. This  is  all  the  more  so  where  the  person
         concerned committed the offences underlying the  expulsion  measure
         as a juvenile."

75. We pause to observe two matters arising from that part of the judgment.
    First, that approach largely reflects the domestic  approach  contained
    in the Rules and Section 117C Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act
    2002 ("Section 117C") when considering private life (viz time spent  in
    the UK, social and cultural integration in  the  UK  and  obstacles  to
    reintegration in home country). As such, those are  all  matters  which
    were taken into account by Judge  Eldridge  and,  as  we  have  already
    concluded, there is no legal error in his conclusions on those issues.

76. Second,  there  are  some  rather  important  differences  between  the
    situation of this Appellant and Mr Maslov. First,  the  Appellant  came
    here when he was almost a teenager and not as a young child. We  accept
    that he came here and has remained here  lawfully.  Second,  unlike  Mr
    Maslov, the Appellant has not continued living with his family. He  was
    already estranged from them at the  time  of  his  detention.  We  have
    concluded that the Judge did not err in relation to his conclusion that
    the Appellant does not  enjoy  family  life  with  his  family.  Third,
    contrary to Mr Maslov who had committed no offences after  his  release
    from prison until he was deported, the Appellant in this case  is  said
    to remain a medium risk of  further  offending  and,  again  unlike  Mr
    Maslov, some of the Appellant's offending has involved violence  or  at
    least the risk of violence.

77. Returning then to the point at which we began this discussion with  the
    Grand Chamber's reference to Article 40 at [83] of the judgment (as set
    out at [61] above), the reference has to be read in its context  of  an
    aim of the juvenile justice system and one  about  which  concerns  had
    recently been raised by the committee related to the  UNCRC  about  the
    country against which Mr Maslov  had  brought  his  complaint.  In  its
    observation, therefore, the Court was using Article 40 UNCRC merely  as
    an interpretative aid to the principle  already  enunciated  about  the
    need to rehabilitate youth offenders. It  merely  "notes"  the  aim  of
    Article 40 and does not suggest that Article  8  directly  incorporates
    that provision which is as we understand Mr Chirico's case.

78. Even if we are wrong about that, we come back to  the  point  that  the
    reference to Article 40 UNCRC adds nothing  to  this  case.  The  Judge
    noted that the convictions  and  offences  were  at  a  time  when  the
    Appellant was not yet an adult ([7] to [9] of the  Decision).  However,
    even on the Appellant's own evidence, he remained a  risk  and  he  was
    aged twenty years at the hearing before Judge Eldridge. Crucially,  the
    Judge found that  the  Appellant  was  not  integrated  in  the  UK,  a
    conclusion which we have upheld.  There  is  therefore  no  aim  within
    Article 40 which has any bearing on this case.

79. We also note Mr Chirico's reliance on the Court of Appeal's judgment in
    this context in Akinyemi No.2 We accept as  was  there  said  that  the
    public interest has a  "moveable"  quality  and  that,  in  appropriate
    cases, the strong public interest in deportation of  foreign  criminals
    may be diminished by specific factors in an individual  case.  In  that
    case, the factor which appears to have significantly weighed  with  the
    court in determining that the Upper Tribunal had  erred  in  dismissing
    the appeal was that the appellant in that case was born in the UK  (see
    [33] and [53] of the judgment). That is of course not  the  case  here.
    Whilst there are some common factors in that case  when  compared  with
    the instant case, that is not the test. Article 8 requires a balance of
    individual rights against the public interest in this case  and  it  is
    rarely appropriate to pray in aid the facts of another  case,  whatever
    factual similarities there might be to that case.

80. Reliance was also placed on the case of CI (Nigeria). We do not need to
    deal with that case in any depth as it is already covered above in what
    we have to say about the  findings  concerning  integration.  We  would
    simply observe that the judgment in that case merely serves to underpin
    what we say about Akinyemi No.  2  and  Mr  Chirico's  arguments  about
    Maslov and Article 40. The relevance of  a  foreign  criminal's  lawful
    residence (or even unlawful residence) as a child is  relevant  to  the
    degree of social and cultural integration  in  the  UK.  That  may,  in
    appropriate cases, be of sufficient depth to lead  to  a  finding  that
    there is a private  and/or  family  life  which  outweighs  the  public
    interest due either to the strengthening of the factors on the side  of
    the interference or a diminution of the public interest on  the  other.
    However, as  we  have  already  concluded,  the  Judge  considered  the
    strength of private  life  formed  (including  the  Appellant's  family
    relationships) when carrying out the balancing exercise and there is no
    error in his assessment.

81. Further, Mr Chirico's reliance on those  two  cases  merely  serves  to
    illustrate our point that the Article 40 argument adds nothing  as,  in
    substance, the Court of Appeal was in those cases applying the guidance
    taken from Maslov which we have dealt with above. Whilst the Judge  did
    not refer to Maslov expressly in the Decision, he followed the guidance
    in substance because he considered the case first through the  lens  of
    the Rules and Section 117C which incorporate the parts of the  judgment
    which are relevant for these purposes.

82. We can deal more shortly with Article 39 UNCRC.  Mr  Chirico  does  not
    rely on any Strasbourg case which makes any reference to that  article.
    He seeks to introduce it by analogy  with  Article  40.  If  Article  8
    incorporates Article 40 UNCRC in a relevant case, as he contends,  then
    the same is true of Article 39. For the reasons we have already  given,
    Maslov does not illustrate what Mr Chirico says it does in relation  to
    the interaction of Article 8 and Article 40. At  most,  Article  40  is
    used as a shorthand to inform a principle of Article 8. It is  no  more
    than an aid to interpretation. In any event, unlike Mr  Maslov's  case,
    there is no criticism made of the UK failing to observe an aim  of  the
    juvenile justice  system  in  this  case.  None  is  suggested  by  the
    evidence.

83. It is in this regard that Mr Chirico's case also falls apart on Article
    39 even if it were correct in law (which we do not accept). As  we  had
    understood part of his argument, it was being suggested that the system
    in this country had let down the Appellant in relation to his care  due
    to his troubled background. The Appellant was, as we have noted,  taken
    into the care of the local authority when he was  aged  sixteen  years.
    There is a passing suggestion to a failure  to  find  the  Appellant  a
    place in education before that when he first moved to  London  to  live
    with his father but no complaint is made about  the  local  authority's
    treatment of him after he was placed  into  care  and  allocated  semi-
    independent accommodation. Judge Eldridge had evidence from Mr  Huntley
    who is the Appellant's  allocated  social  worker.  We  have  read  his
    evidence with some care. There is nothing in it  to  suggest  that  the
    authorities have failed the Appellant in their care of him.

84. As we observed in the course of Mr Chirico's submissions, it  seems  to
    us that whereas Article 40  is  concerned  with  the  juvenile  justice
    system, Article 39 is relevant to the position of  vulnerable  children
    and, therefore, in this context, to State care of such children.  There
    is no evidence that the UK has failed in its obligations to  "take  all
    appropriate measures" in relation to the Appellant. True it is that the
    Appellant has been found not to have integrated in the UK but  that  is
    not by reason of any failure by the authorities but by  reason  of  his
    own actions.

85. Even if Mr Chirico's argument was correct in law,  therefore,  Articles
    39 and 40 have no bearing on  this  case  on  the  evidence.  They  add
    nothing to the issue whether the Appellant  is  in  fact  socially  and
    culturally integrated in the UK  and  whether  removing  him  from  his
    family who live in the UK and from his private life here would  disrupt
    such integration. Judge Eldridge made a finding that the  Appellant  is
    not integrated and does not have family life with his relatives in  the
    UK. Having upheld those findings, therefore, there  is  nothing  in  Mr
    Chirico's submissions based on Article 39  and  40  UNCRC  which  could
    conceivably make any difference to those findings.

86. For those reasons, although we accept  that  Judge  Eldridge  erred  by
    failing to deal with these arguments, we conclude that such error makes
    no difference, and we decline to set aside the Decision based  on  that
    error.

    CONCLUSION

87. For the above reasons, we are satisfied that there is an error  of  law
    in the Decision  for  failure  to  consider  the  arguments  concerning
    Articles 39 and 40 UNCRC but that the error could make no difference to
    the outcome for the reasons we have given. We are satisfied that  there
    is no other error of  law  identified  by  the  grounds.  We  therefore
    decline to set aside the Decision. We uphold the Decision.




    DECISION

    The Decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Mark Eldridge promulgated  on
    31 October 2019 does involve the making of an error on a point  of  law
    on ground two only, but we decline to set aside the  decision  on  that
    basis as the error makes no difference. The grounds  do  not  establish
    any other error of law.  We therefore  uphold  the  Decision  with  the
    consequence that the Appellant's appeal remains dismissed.
