                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS



 1. The appellant is a Somali national who was born on 4 April  1987.   She
    appeals against a decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge  Walters  which
    was promulgated on 2 October 2013 following a hearing at  Taylor  House
    on 12 September 2013.

 2. I shall  summarise  the  history  of  this  application  briefly.   The
    appellant is married to a Mr Iyow who  was  also  originally  a  Somali
    citizen but who was granted refugee status in the UK in  2001  and  was
    subsequently granted British citizenship.  The couple were  married  in
    2004 by proxy in Somalia and  the  marriage  was  registered  with  the
    Swedish authorities in 2009.  It seems that the appellant was granted a
    refugee status  of  some  sort  in  Sweden  in  that  she  was  granted
    indefinite leave to remain having originally fled Somalia  and  claimed
    asylum in Sweden.

 3. The couple met in 2005 and there are now four children of the marriage.
     The children are aged respectively 7, 5 and 3, and  there  is  also  a
    baby who  has  recently  been  born  in  November  2013.   Because  the
    appellant's husband was a British citizen who was being educated in the
    UK he could not go to live with the appellant in Sweden.  She  was  not
    entitled to live in the UK and so the appellant's husband  would  visit
    her in Sweden when he could  and  sometimes  she  would  visit  him  in
    London.  She found this very difficult and so after  having  her  third
    child in 2011 she came to this country originally as a visitor but then
    remained without leave  thereafter.   The  three  oldest  children  are
    nationals of Sweden and they have a right to continue  living  in  this
    country with their father.  The youngest, who was born last year, is  a
    British citizen having been born to a British citizen.

 4. The current position with regard to the appellant's husband is that  he
    has an income of around �26,000 a year and is currently  completing  at
    the same time an MSc in a specialised form of engineering which will be
    completed relatively soon.

 5. The appellant made an application for a residence card under  the  2006
    Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations but this  was  refused
    by the respondent.  It appears that the  application  might  have  been
    founded on the rights of her children who were exercising treaty rights
    in this country although this is not entirely clear  from  the  papers.
    It is certainly the case that she was not entitled  to  any  derivative
    rights by reason of her husband's presence in this country because  her
    husband is a British citizen and  therefore  is  not  in  this  country
    exercising treaty rights.

 6. It is not suggested on behalf of the appellant  that  in  fact  she  is
    entitled to a residence  card.   The  appellant  appealed  against  the
    decision of the respondent not to issue a residence card (at that  time
    it was not accepted that she was not entitled to a residence card)  and
    included in her grounds of appeal were grounds that she was entitled to
    remain in this country pursuant to her rights under Article 8.

 7. Her appeal was as noted above heard before  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Walters sitting at Taylor House on 12 September 2013 but  he  dismissed
    her appeal under the 2006 Regulations (and it is not now suggested that
    he was wrong so to do).  However, with regard to the  Article  8  claim
    Judge Walters read out that part of the  refusal  letter  dealing  with
    Article 8 which is incorporated into his determination at paragraph  24
    as follows:

         "Page 4 of the refusal letter deals with Article 8.  It  reads,  in
         part:

             'Consideration has been given to your family or  private  life
             established in the UK under Article 8 of the  ECHR.   ...   If
             you wish the UKBA to consider an application on this basis you
             must make a separate charged application using the appropriate
             specified application form (FLR (M)) for the five year partner
             route or FLR(O) for the five year parent or ten  year  partner
             or parent route, or FLR(O)  for  the  ten  year  private  life
             route.  ...  Since you have not made a valid  application  for
             Article 8 consideration, consideration has not been  given  as
             to whether your removal from the UK would breach Article 8  of
             the ECHR.  Additionally, it is pointed out that a decision not
             to issue a residence card/permanent residence  card  does  not
             require you to leave the United Kingdom if you  can  otherwise
             demonstrate  that  you  have  a  right  to  reside  under  the
             Regulations.'"

    As explained in the determination, what was meant by this was that  the
    respondent would wish to levy a  considerably  higher  fee  before  she
    considered an Article 8 application and that was why Article 8 was  not
    considered in any detail by the respondent.

 8. Judge Walters found at paragraph 26 as follows:

         "I accept, of course, that there is no requirement on the appellant
         to leave the UK and therefore the first question raised  in  Razgar
         [2004] UKHL 27 cannot apply which is:

             '(i) Will the proposed removal be an interference by a  public
                  authority with the exercise of the  applicant's  right  to
                  respect for his private or family life?'"

 9. For this reason he continued at paragraph 27 as follows:

         "27. I therefore did not find that I had a valid Article  8  appeal
             before me and that, in order to bring such an appeal before  a
             Tribunal,  the  appellant  would  have  to  make  one  of  the
             applications suggested by the respondent quoted above."

10. The appellant appealed against this decision and permission  to  appeal
    was initially refused  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Pirotta  on  15
    January 2014 who agreed with Judge Walters that because there had  been
    no removal directions Article 8 was not engaged.  The appellant renewed
    her application for permission to appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  and
    eventually on 20 February 2014 permission  to  appeal  was  granted  by
    Upper Tribunal Judge  Grubb  who  when  setting  out  his  reasons  for
    granting permission to appeal stated as follows:

         "...

         2.   The judge concluded that there was  not  'a  valid  Article  8
             appeal' before him and so did  not  consider  the  appellant's
             Article 8 rights which would  appear  to  be  engaged  on  the
             evidence before him.  That was an arguable error of  law.   To
             the extent it was necessary, as the notice  of  decision  made
             clear, the appellant  was  told  that  'she  should  now  make
             arrangements to leave'.  In any  event,  it  does  not  appear
             necessary in order to require a consideration of Article 8  in
             an appeal that the immigration decision entails  removal:  see
             JM (Liberia) ... [2006] EWCA Civ 1402 - an  appeal  against  a
             decision refusing to vary leave.  ..."

11. I heard submissions with  regard  to  whether  or  not  the  First-tier
    Tribunal had erred in law by refusing to consider the appellant's claim
    under Article 8 and in my judgment it is clear that this was  an  error
    of law.  I give my reasons for so finding.  This  was  an  applicantion
    made pursuant to the 2006 EEA Regulations and the appeal was against  a
    refusal to grant a residence card pursuant to those  Regulations.   The
    appeal rights in respect against an  EEA  decision  pursuant  to  these
    Regulations are set out at Regulation 26, and at Regulation 26(7) it is
    provided as follows:

         "The provisions of  or  made  under  the  2002  Act  [that  is  the
         Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002]  referred  to  in
         Schedule 1 shall have effect for the purposes of  an  appeal  under
         these Regulations to the First-tier  Tribunal  in  accordance  with
         that Schedule."

    By Schedule 1 it is provided as follows:

         "1.  The following provisions of, or made under, the 2002 Act  have
             effect in relation to an appeal under these Regulations ... as
             if it were an appeal against  an  immigration  decision  under
             Section 82(1) of that Act."

    Although there are certain exceptions, one of the provisions  which  is
    included is Section 84(1)(g) of that Act which provides as follows:

         "84  Grounds of appeal

             (1)  An appeal under  Section  82(1)  against  an  immigration
                  decision must be brought on one or more of  the  following
                  grounds -

                  ...

                  (g)  that removal of the appellant from the United Kingdom
                      in consequence  of  the  immigration  decision  would
                      breach the United  Kingdom's  obligations  under  the
                      Refugee Convention or would be unlawful under Section
                      6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 as being  incompatible
                      with the appellant's Convention rights.  ..."

12. It is not suggested on behalf of the respondent that (as noted by Judge
    Grubb when giving his reasons for granting permission  to  appeal)  the
    principles as set out by the Court of Appeal in JM (Liberia) would  not
    apply and it is accordingly clear in this case that having included  an
    Article 8 claim in her grounds of appeal the appellant was entitled  to
    have this properly considered by Judge Walters and that Judge  Walters'
    failure so to consider her claim under Article 8 was an error  of  law.
    It follows that insofar as her claim under Article  8  is  concerned  I
    must remake the decision.  I record that on behalf of the respondent Mr
    Jarvis accepted that Judge Walters' failure to consider the  Article  8
    claim was an error of law.

13. Having found an error of law, with the agreement of both parties I have
    then gone on to remake the decision.



The Hearing

14. I must at the outset express my gratitude  to  the  representatives  of
    both parties for the clear, concise but nonetheless thorough manner  in
    which the interests both of the appellant and of  the  respondent  were
    represented.  On behalf of the appellant Mr Bild relied in  part  on  a
    skeleton argument which  he  had  produced  for  the  purposes  of  the
    hearing.  On behalf of the respondent  Mr  Jarvis  ensured  that  every
    argument which could properly be put on behalf of  the  respondent  was
    put and that there was  no  danger  of  the  appellant's  appeal  being
    allowed by reason of his failure to address the Tribunal to the matters
    set out within the Immigration Rules as they now apply.

15. The appellant relied upon a bundle of documents which had been prepared
    for this hearing in anticipation that  the  Tribunal  would  go  on  to
    remake the decision without any further adjournment should an error  of
    law be found which bundle included witness  statements  from  both  the
    appellant  and  her  husband  which  had  been  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  For the  reasons  which  follow  I  did  hear  some  further
    evidence given by the appellant although this  was  merely  to  satisfy
    myself as to her ability to speak English as this was  a  factor  which
    was raised during argument by Mr Jarvis.

16. On behalf of the respondent Mr Jarvis did not seek to challenge any  of
    the evidence contained within this bundle of documents and so  for  the
    purposes of this hearing I accept that everything set out within  these
    documents is genuine and accurate and indeed there  is  no  basis  upon
    which I could do otherwise.

17. I heard submissions on behalf of both parties which as I  have  already
    indicated were extremely thorough and dealt with every aspect  of  this
    appeal.  I  attempted  to  record  everything  which  was  said  to  me
    contemporaneously and as my notes are contained within  the  Record  of
    Proceedings I will not set out below every word which was  said  during
    the course of  the  hearing  but  shall  refer  only  to  such  of  the
    submissions as are necessary for the purposes of this determination.  I
    have, however, taken account of everything which was said to me  during
    the hearing as well as to all the documents contained within  the  file
    whether or not any specific part of the submissions or the documents is
    referred to specifically below.  I shall summarise briefly first of all
    the submissions which were made on  behalf  of  the  respondent  by  Mr
    Jarvis, who quite properly felt it his duty to address me as to what he
    considered the respondent's policy was with regard to  applications  or
    appeals under  Article  8  because  he  submitted  the  provisions  now
    contained within the Rules were "very broad and very generous".

18. There was some discussion as to whether or not this claim  fell  to  be
    considered under Appendix EX.1 but it was eventually agreed between all
    parties that this was a claim where  one  should  have  regard  to  the
    provisions of E-LTRP.2.1. contained within Appendix FM of the Rules and
    which provides as follows:

         "Immigration status requirements

         E-LTRP.2.1.   The applicant must not be in the UK -

                    (a)    as a visitor;

                    (b)    with valid leave granted  for  a  period  of  six
                        months or less, unless that leave is as a fianc�(e)
                        or proposed civil partner, or

                    (c)    on temporary admission.

         E-LTRP.2.2.   The applicant must not be in  the  UK  in  breach  of
                    immigration laws (disregarding any period of overstaying
                    for a period of 28 days or less), unless paragraph EX.1.
                    applies."

    Mr Jarvis agreed that as this appellant was technically in  the  UK  in
    breach of immigration laws (because she had overstayed the  leave  that
    had been granted to her) pursuant to E-LTRP.2.2.  the  Tribunal  should
    have regard when  considering  this  appeal  under  Article  8  to  the
    provisions of paragraph EX.1.

19. Essentially the position that Mr Jarvis on  behalf  of  the  respondent
    asked the Tribunal to adopt was that there was nothing disproportionate
    about requiring this appellant to leave the country.  It  was  conceded
    (and I will deal with this below) that the financial requirements which
    would be necessary under FM-SE had technically not been met and it  was
    said that the English language requirement had  not  been  met  either.
    The effect of the  Rules  was  that  this  was  an  expression  of  the
    respondent's very broad and very generous policy  and  that  the  court
    should give great weight to the need to maintain a fair and  consistent
    system of immigration control.

20. I apologise to Mr Jarvis if I have summarised his case  in  too  little
    detail but as is clear from the Record of Proceedings he did  take  the
    Tribunal to all the  relevant  passages  contained  within  the  Rules.
    Essentially  it  was  Mr  Jarvis'  case  that  the  appellant  had  had
    considerable experience of living in Sweden, three of her children  had
    been born there and been brought up there without her husband and  that
    although the baby was a British citizen this was not in itself a  trump
    card and using the words used by Mr Justice Sales in Gulshan  it  would
    not be "unjustifiably harsh" to require this  appellant,  who  was  not
    entitled to remain here under the Immigration Rules or  under  the  EEA
    Regulations, to go back to Sweden from where she came.  It would not be
    difficult for the whole family to go with her bearing in mind that  the
    Tribunal could take judicial notice of the fact that English is  widely
    spoken in Sweden.

21. With regard to the failure of the appellant to provide any  certificate
    showing that she had the level of English which would be required  were
    she to make an application to be here as a spouse under the Immigration
    Rules I considered it appropriate (when considering what weight  should
    be given to this factor if any) to ask her  some  questions  myself  to
    ascertain whether or not this was a point to which any weight should be
    attached.  Mr Jarvis did not object to my taking such a course  and  it
    was entirely apparent that the appellant is fluent in English and  that
    her standard of English is excellent.  It is certainly very much higher
    than the standard which would be required in order  to  enable  her  to
    satisfy the English language requirement within the Rules.  She clearly
    speaks very good English indeed.

22. On behalf of the appellant Mr Bild essentially submitted that it  would
    not be reasonable to require any of this family to relocate  to  Sweden
    which  realistically  is  the  only  place  they  could  now  go.   The
    appellant's husband had come to this country in 2001,  had  immediately
    been granted refugee status and thereafter became  a  British  citizen.
    Although the appellant had not produced the documentary evidence  which
    would be required were she to have made an application to be allowed to
    remain under the Rules this was because it was accepted from the outset
    that such an application could not succeed  for  the  technical  reason
    that her immigration status  was  that  she  was  here  without  leave.
    Accordingly it was known that she would have to rely on the  provisions
    contained within EX.1 which effectively exempts her with regard to  the
    technical requirements under the Rules (that is to produce documents in
    a specified form) and also from the English language requirements.

23. However, insofar as these were matters which were  relevant  when  this
    Tribunal  considered  proportionality  there  was   evidence   of   the
    appellant's husband's income contained within the wage slips within the
    bundle and as noted  by  the  Tribunal  it  was  also  clear  that  the
    appellant spoke very good English.  It had not been contested on behalf
    of the respondent that the appellant met the substantive  requirements,
    that this was not a near-miss case (and it  is  accepted  there  is  no
    longer such a  category  in  any  event)  but  the  fact  is  that  the
    appellant's husband support his family with no recourse to public funds
    and  the  appellant  speaks  good  English.   This  is  relevant   when
    considering proportionality or whether or not a decision to remove  the
    appellant (which carries an implication if this  family  is  to  remain
    together that the whole family would be removed) is reasonable.

24. So the question this Tribunal has to consider  is  whether  or  not  it
    would be reasonable for the family to live now in Sweden.  Three of the
    children are EEA nationals who are integrated in schooling  in  the  UK
    aged respectively 7, 5 and 3.  They have  friends  here.   These  three
    children are Swedish but entitled to reside in this country, the  other
    family members being the appellant's husband and a baby are British and
    have a right of  abode  and  while  it  is  correct  that  the  British
    citizenship of the baby is not a trump  card  nonetheless  there  would
    have to be a powerful countervailing force here  and  beyond  the  fact
    that this appellant is technically here without leave there has been no
    other criminality and there is nothing to outweigh the  very  important
    consideration to be given  to  the  rights  of  the  British  child  in
    particular and in addition the right of the EU  children  to  integrate
    into the host state that they are now in.  It was  submitted  that  all
    this is relevant when  this  Tribunal  considers  reasonableness  under
    EX.1.

25. It should also be noted in this regard that as is confirmed within  the
    bundle at page 29 the appellant's husband is  currently  in  the  final
    stages of completing his MSc  in  telecommunication  engineering.   The
    expected end date is 31 August 2014.  It would not be a  simple  matter
    to transfer the skills that he has acquired and that he is using in his
    current job should he be obliged to move to Sweden.



Discussion

26. In my judgment this is a very easy decision to make because  I  do  not
    consider the factors competing one  way  or  the  other  to  be  finely
    balanced at all.  On the one hand there  is  the  perfectly  legitimate
    need to enforce and apply a consistent and fair system  of  immigration
    control.  This is recognised within the new  Rules  and  indeed  it  is
    recognised in established jurisprudence.  However, the new  Rules  also
    recognise (especially if as Mr Jarvis maintains they  are  intended  to
    provide a broad and generous  basis  upon  which  deserving  appellants
    should be allowed to remain even though they are not entitled otherwise
    to remain under the Rules) that a person  should  not  be  required  to
    leave the UK where the consequences would, weighing  up  the  competing
    factors together, be "unjustifiably harsh".  In my  judgement,  on  any
    view of this case it would be "unjustifiably  harsh"  to  require  this
    appellant to leave this country now either with or without her  family.
    Although exceptionality is a prediction and not a test I consider  that
    the circumstances disclosed in this appeal can properly be said  to  be
    exceptional.

27. I also consider that on the basis of the evidence which  has  been  put
    before me the reasons why this appellant should be allowed to remain in
    this country are very compelling indeed.  I will  summarise  them  very
    briefly, because they have already been identified above.

28. This is a case which exposes an anomaly contained within the  interplay
    between the EEA Regulations  and  the  Immigration  Rules  because  the
    appellant's husband who is a British citizen would be entitled to  live
    with his entire family in Sweden (because if he went to work in  Sweden
    his wife would be entitled to be with him as the dependent wife  of  an
    EU citizen exercising treaty rights in another EU  country)  but  under
    the Rules there is no equivalent right for his wife to remain  in  this
    country.  However, notwithstanding this anomaly, the reasons  why  this
    appeal should be allowed are in any event overwhelming.

29. The appellant's husband is clearly entirely  settled  in  this  country
    now.  He has been here, having been granted refugee  status,  for  over
    thirteen years, is fully integrated  into  British  society  and  there
    would obviously be considerable upheaval were he now to be  obliged  to
    leave his current job where he is  earning  a  good  income  (from  the
    papers it is clear that this is around �26,000 a year) on which  he  is
    able to maintain his wife and four children.

30. There is no reason in  principle  other  than  the  desire  to  enforce
    compliance with technical requirements why the appellant could be  said
    not to satisfy the  substantive  requirements  under  the  Rules.   Her
    husband earns enough  to  maintain  the  entire  family  (this  is  not
    disputed) and although she does not have a piece of paper to say so she
    is clearly integrated into this society to the extent that  she  speaks
    what  is  almost  perfect  English.   The  three  oldest  children  are
    integrated into British society to the extent that they are  at  school
    here and have friends here.  The baby, who is  a  British  citizen,  is
    entitled to a right of abode in this country.

31. Although I was not referred to either the  decision  of  the  House  of
    Lords in Chikwamba or the subsequent decision of the Court of Appeal in
    Hayat  I  must  have  these  decisions  in  mind,  in  particular   the
    observations in the Court of Appeal in Hayat that if an applicant  such
    as this appellant, especially in cases involving young children, is  to
    be required to leave this country with a view to making an  application
    to return as a spouse, a good reason must be given.  That is not to say
    that there will necessarily not be such a reason, because in many cases
    there will.  In this case, however, I am firmly of the view that  there
    would not.

32. For the reasons I have given, I consider that  this  is  one  of  those
    cases which can be said fairly to be exceptional and where the  reasons
    for allowing this appeal can be said  to  be  very  compelling.   I  am
    entirely satisfied on the evidence which I have  considered  that  were
    the appellant now to go to Sweden and make an application from there to
    return under the provisions of the Immigration Rules there is no reason
    why that application  should  not  succeed.   In  those  circumstances,
    following the guidance given in Chikwamba and  Hayat,  it  is  entirely
    disproportionate to require her to do so merely so that it can be  said
    that the i's are dotted and the t's are  crossed  with  regard  to  the
    technical  requirements  under  the  Rules.   For  these  reasons   the
    appellant's appeal must be allowed and I shall so find.



Decision.

I set aside  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  as  containing  a
material error of law and in substitute the following decision:

The appellant's appeal is dismissed under the EEA Regulations 2006.

The appellant's appeal is allowed on human rights grounds, Article 8.
