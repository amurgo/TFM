Anonymity directions not made
For the Appellant: Mr G Davison (counsel, instructed by Morgan Mark
Solicitors)
For the Respondent: Ms R Patten (Home Office Presenting Officer)

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. The First Appellant applied for leave to remain in the UK as a Tier 1
   (Entrepreneur), the Second and Third Appellants applied as his
   dependents. The applications were refused with the Secretary of State
   expressing the view that the First Appellant had submitted false
   documents (banks statements) in support of the application and relying on
   a document verification report (DVR) of the 1st of October 2013.

2. The Appellants appealed to the First-tier Tribunal, their appeals were
   heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Rose at Hatton Cross on the 25th of
   March 2014. In a determination promulgated on the 31st of March 2014 the
   appeals were dismissed with the Judge finding that the Secretary of State
   had discharged the burden of proof on her to show that the documents
   submitted were false.

3. The Appellants sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal in
   grounds of the 4th of April 2014. In the grounds it was observed that the
   Secretary of State had, at an earlier hearing, been granted an
   adjournment to enable her to verify two later letters from the bank
   submitted to rebut the DVR. The failure to obtain an updated DVR ought to
   have featured more heavily in the Judge's reasoning. It was also
   submitted that there was procedural unfairness in that the Judge made
   findings on the documentation without raising the points with the
   Appellants' representatives in the hearing.

4. The application was considered by Judge Cox who granted permission on
   the basis that it was just arguable that the Judge should have given more
   weight to the Respondent's failure to conduct further verification checks
   on the new evidence submitted by the Appellant. He was not impressed by
   the complaint about the failure to raise with the parties his analysis of
   the documents originally submitted.

5. At the hearing Mr Davison relied on the grounds that had been submitted
   and submitted that it was a matter of fairness that the concerns should
   have been raised with the parties and if need be the hearing could have
   been resumed. It was accepted that there was no explanation for the
   mathematical errors that the Judge had identified. There was no
   additional evidence available.

6. For the Home Office it was submitted that it was not simply the maths
   that placed the documents in question. The DHL envelope showed that the
   new letters had been sent from a residential address and not the bank
   itself. The evidence was that the account did not exist and the contents
   of the statements were problematic. The fact that the Judge considered
   the evidence after the hearing was not material, he had heard from the
   First Appellant and had an issue with the evidence given. Evidential
   flexibility did not apply to the decision.

7. In the determination the issues relating to the bank statements were
   considered at paragraphs 13 to 27. It cannot be said that he had dealt
   with the bank statements and the later supporting letters briefly or
   without regard to the wider issues. At paragraph 14 he noted correctly
   that as the letters related to the genuineness of the bank statements
   they could properly be considered in evidence. At paragraph 17 the
   relevant burden and standard in relation to allegations of forgery was
   set out.

8. In addition to the DVR the Judge considered the contents of the bank
   statements at paragraphs 19 to 21. It is not suggested that the Judge's
   analysis of the mathematics in the statements is incorrect. Not only was
   he referring to entries for November and December 2012 which showed
   errors in the balance shown but there was, and there remains, no evidence
   to explain how the errors were made or to show that they have been
   corrected by the bank at any stage. At paragraph 20 the Judge noted the
   anomaly that the account held over ï¿½500,000 but that the deposits and
   withdrawals were relatively small. In paragraph 21 the Judge referred to
   inconsistencies in the balances.

9. By the time the case came to be heard the nature of the bank statements
   was clearly in issue. The Appellant had the advantage of representation
   and, with the production of the bank letters, had taken steps to address
   the question of the statement's validity. The Appellant's representatives
   had had more time than the Judge to consider the actual contents of the
   statement relied upon.

10. In addition to the contents of the statements and the admitted and
   unexplained problems with the mathematics of the balances displayed the
   Judge also considered the letters that the Appellants relied upon in
   paragraphs 22 to 25. He gave good reasons for considering that the
   letters did not assist, that he could have given more reasons for
   rejecting the statements or for regarding the letters as at least of no
   real assistance does not alter the fact that he gave adequate reasons.

11. The complaints made in the grounds of application to the Upper Tribunal
   have no substance. It is clear from the determination that the Judge gave
   proper and full consideration to the documentation that had been provided
   for his consideration. The parties usually have the documents for far
   more time than a Judge and it is not the fault of the Judge that in this
   case the neither the First Appellant nor the representatives had not had
   regard to the clear contents of the bank statements even though their
   validity was already in issue. I note that despite that has been
   available there remains no explanation for the points made by the Judge
   in his analysis.

12. This was a fully and carefully considered determination in which the
   Judge was alert to the relevant issues that had been raised and
   considered all of the documents with care and attention. The reasons
   given for rejecting the bank letters submitted in support of the
   statements were clearly open to him and the reasons relied on for the
   conclusions reached were properly made out. The determination contains no
   errors of law.

CONCLUSIONS

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the
making of an error on a point of law.

I do not set aside the decision.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of
the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005 and I make no
order.

Fee Award

In dismissing these appeals I make no fee award.

Deputy Judge of the Upper Tribunal (IAC)
