Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Diwnych, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms Faryl, of Counsel

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   In this appeal the appellant is the Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
    Department and to avoid confusion I shall refer to her  as  being  "the
    claimant".

2.   The respondent is a citizen of Nigeria  who  was  born  on  28th  June,
    1986.

3.   She appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal  against  a  decision  of  the
    respondent, taken on 15th  May,  2014  to  remove  her  as  an  illegal
    entrant.  Her  appeal  was  based  on  her  claim  to  be  in  need  of
    international  protection  as  a  refugee,  alternatively  humanitarian
    protection and also on the basis that  her  removal  would  breach  her
    rights under the 1950 Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and
    Fundamental Freedoms.

4.   The respondent's appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Holt  at
    Manchester Piccadilly on 9th July, 2014.  She purported  to  allow  the
    respondent's asylum appeal, and the humanitarian protection appeal  and
    the respondent's human rights appeal,  based  on  her  claim  that  her
    removal from the United Kingdom would breach her rights under  Articles
    2, 3 and 8 of the 1950 Convention.

5.   The claimant challenged the  decision  asserting  that  the  judge  had
    failed to give adequate reasons for finding  at  paragraph  59  of  her
    determination that the respondent would be unable  to  access  shelters
    for victims of trafficking.  The claimant had referred in  her  refusal
    letter to  objective  evidence  suggesting  that  there  were  shelters
    available for victims of trafficking  in  Nigeria.   The  grounds  also
    asserted that there was no reference in any  of  the  material  to  any
    difficulty or lack of access for women with children  and  no  evidence
    had been provided by the respondent's representatives to  suggest  that
    women with children would be unable to access shelters.   As  a  result
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge had  reversed  the  burden  of  proof  in
    respect of the availability of shelters by what she said  at  paragraph
    59.

6.    Addressing  me,  Counsel  suggested   that   paragraph   59   of   the
    determination needed to be read in conjunction with paragraph 58.   The
    judge was entitled to find that the respondent would  not  be  able  to
    access facilities on the basis of the fact that she has young  children
    and no-one to return to in Nigeria.  She was effectively relying on  PO
    (Nigeria) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] EWCA  Civ
    132 and in particular on paragraph 19, where  the  expert  referred  to
    suggested that there were funding problems resulting  in  no  childcare
    facilities such as crï¿½ches or private facilities for  nursing  mothers,
    no medical facilities beyond first aid and the  facility  for  hospital
    referrals in emergency, and no qualified mental  health  therapists  in
    the shelters.  The Immigration Judge recognised that on  the  facts  of
    the appeal the respondent would not be accepted  in  the  shelters  and
    recognised that the appellant would be unable to support  herself  with
    young children due to her vulnerability and lack of family  support  on
    return to Nigeria.

7.   For the claimant, Mr Diwnych pointed out that the Reasons  for  Refusal
    Letter does make reference to  the  availability  of  federal  shelters
    which have childcare facilities and no evidence was adduced  on  behalf
    of the respondent to show that the respondent would not be accommodated
    in one of them.  The judge reversed the burden of proof and  failed  to
    take account of the evidence relating to  federal  shelters.   In  that
    respect she had erred.  She had further erred by going on to allow  the
    appeal under Article 8.  She had not given  any  consideration  to  the
    question of the Immigration Rules and it was simply inadequate for  her
    to suggest that since she had allowed the appeal she did  not  need  to
    consider the issue separately.  Counsel pointed out that there  was  no
    finding in respect of EX.1.  In the event that the refugee claim stands
    then any error she may have  made  in  respect  of  Article  8  is  not
    material.  Counsel agreed that in the  event  that  the  asylum  appeal
    failed then what the judge had  said  at  paragraph  64  was  a  wholly
    inadequate basis for  allowing  the  respondent's  appeal  outside  the
    Immigration Rules on the basis of her Article 8 rights.

8.   I reserved my decision.

9.   Having read the judge's  decision  I  have  been  unable  to  find  any
    reference by her to any objective evidence dealing with the question of
    the  availability   of   shelters   suitable   for   the   respondent's
    accommodation with her children.  Whilst she does refer to the  Reasons
    for Refusal Letter she makes no specific reference to paragraphs 60, 67
    or 68 and it is paragraph 68 which refers  to  the  Country  of  Origin
    Information Report on Nigeria of 14th June, 2013 which  in  turn  makes
    reference to the  British-Danish  2008  FFM  Report  dealing  with  the
    Federal Ministry of Women's Affairs and Social Development  shelter  in
    Abuja for battered women and accompanying children which is said to  be
    "modelled after the shelters of NGOs".

10.  At paragraphs 58 and 59 the judge said this:

         "58. However, I find that the [respondent] would be in an extremely
             difficult  and  vulnerable  situation  should  she  return  to
             Nigeria.  She would be returning as an individual who has  not
             lived there for ten years.  She would go back  with  different
             vulnerabilities  as  a  mother  with  three   young   children
             (including the new-born baby).  Whilst it is probably  correct
             that the [respondent] would be  able  to  avoid  a  particular
             individual who has  made  threats  to  her  previously,  I  am
             satisfied that the [respondent] would still  be  returning  to
             circumstances of extreme vulnerability to  exploitation.   She
             has no family or social network to support her upon return  to
             Nigeria.  She has only known  exploitation  and  servitude  in
             Nigeria in the past and also at the hands of  (some)  Nigerian
             in the United Kingdom and I find that she would  be  at  grave
             risk of falling back into similar situations  of  exploitation
             and servitude upon return.


         59.  In contrast, the only evidence that the [claimant] could point
             to in order to support their contention that the  [respondent]
             would not be at risk on return is the  fact  that  they  claim
             that there is a system of women's refuges in the  main  cities
             in Nigeria where the [respondent] could access help.  However,
             there is no evidence that this  particular  [respondent]  with
             two very young children and a soon-to-be-born  baby  would  be
             accepted by any such women's refuge organisation.  Further  it
             is difficult to see how the  [respondent]  would  be  able  to
             survive financially for the next few years given that she will
             not be able to leave her children in  order  to  work  without
             making them very vulnerable.  This is because I find that  she
             has no family  members  to  look  after  them  and  I  am  not
             satisfied that she would have the ability to pay for safe  and
             reliable childcare for three children  while  she  worked,  in
             addition to feeding and housing her family.   Further,  whilst
             the [claimant] has also provided two pages of photocopies from
             financial organisations in Nigeria who  make  small  loans  to
             people wishing to set up small businesses, I am not  satisfied
             that this would be practicable or useful  to  this  particular
             [respondent].  I find that the [respondent] would  be  a  most
             unattractive client for a bank to  lend  money  to  given  her
             circumstances."

11.  I am satisfied that the judge did err in law by  failing  to  refer  to
    any credible background evidence that a trafficked woman with  children
    would be unable  to  access  refuge  shelters  on  return  to  Nigeria.
    Counsel drew my attention to the  Court  of  Appeal's  decision  in  PO
    (Trafficked Women) Nigeria CG [2009] UKAIT 00046, but the claimant  had
    of course relied upon objective evidence contained in  the  Country  of
    Origin Information Report, suggesting that there is a  federal  shelter
    which accepts accompanying children and which is, apparently, "modelled
    after the shelters of NGOs".

12.  Having found there to be an error of law in the  judge's  consideration
    of the respondent's asylum appeal  it  follows  that  this  error  also
    taints  the  judge's  conclusions  in  respect  of   the   respondent's
    humanitarian appeal.  The  judge's  consideration  of  the  appellant's
    Article 8 appeal outside the Immigration Rules is inadequate and  fails
    to demonstrate that the judge has carried out a proper  proportionality
    assessment.

13.  I am satisfied  that  this  is  a  case  which  falls  squarely  within
    paragraph 7 of the Senior President's  practice  statement,  given  the
    length of time the parties would have to wait  for  the  matter  to  be
    relisted before me in Manchester and  that  it  could,  conversely,  be
    heard relatively speedily by the First-tier Tribunal and in view of the
    overriding objective in forming the forward conduct of  the  appeal,  I
    have decided that the appeal be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for
    a hearing afresh before a First-tier Tribunal Judge  other  than  Judge
    Holt.

14.  Judge Holt refers at paragraph 53 to  having  had  concerns  about  the
    appellant's credibility and not being satisfied that the appellant  had
    told the truth.  In fairness to the appellant I direct that the  appeal
    should be heard afresh de novo.  A Yoruba interpreter will be  required
    and two hours should be allowed for the hearing of the appeal.


Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him/her or any member of their family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
