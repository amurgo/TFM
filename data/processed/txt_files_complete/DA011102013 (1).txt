Representation:
For the Appellant:         Ms A Everett a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:        Mr A Akindele a Solicitor from A & A Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1. The appellant is the Secretary of State for the Home  Department.  We
       will refer to her as the Secretary of  State.  The  respondent  is  a
       citizen of Jamaica who was born on 24 April 1957. We  will  refer  to
       him as the claimant. He has  been  given  permission  to  appeal  the
       determination of a panel (First-Tier Tribunal Judge Holder  and  non-
       legal member Mrs S I Hewitt JP) who dismissed his appeal against  the
       Secretary of State's decision of 29 May 2013  to  make  an  automatic
       deportation order against him under the provisions of section 32  (5)
       of the UK Borders Act  2007  as  a  foreign  national  who  had  been
       convicted of an offence and sentenced to a period of imprisonment  of
       at least 12 months.

    2. The offence leading to  the  deportation  order  was  the  claimant's
       conviction at Bristol Crown Court on 29 February 2012 when he pleaded
       guilty to supplying a class A drug (crack cocaine) for which  he  was
       sentenced to 6 years imprisonment and there was a confiscation  order
       in respect of �12,600.

    3. On 8 August 1973 the claimant was granted leave to enter  the  UK  in
       order to join his father. His father was living here with his mother.
       The claimant had been brought up in Jamaica  by  his  grandmother  He
       arrived here on 11 October 1973 and was granted indefinite  leave  to
       remain. He has lived here ever since, although he has made two visits
       to Jamaica one of them for his grandmother's funeral. It is  not  now
       clear whether, in about 2010, he applied for British citizenship  but
       withdrew the application because he needed  his  passport  to  go  to
       Jamaica for his grandmother's funeral or whether he applied for  what
       has been referred to as a "no time limit". Nobody has  been  able  to
       explain to us exactly what a "no time limit" is, although we  surmise
       that it  is  likely  to  have  been  an  application  to  provide  an
       appropriate endorsement in his  Jamaican  passport  showing  that  he
       still had indefinite leave to remain. However, it  is  common  ground
       that the claimant has always been in this country legally, is still a
       Jamaican citizen and has never become a British citizen.

    4. The pre-sentence report  prepared  in  November  2011  prior  to  the
       claimant's conviction for the index offence records that he had  been
       convicted 21 times for a total of  35  offences.  His  likelihood  of
       reconviction was assessed as low but the risk of causing serious harm
       as medium. There had been 8 offences against the  person,  1  offence
       against property, 19 theft and kindred offences,  2  public  disorder
       offences, 3 offences relating to  police/courts/prisons  and  3  drug
       offences. The first conviction was on 17 December 1976 and  the  last
       (the index offence) on 29 February 2012. The  claimant  is  still  in
       prison.

    5. The claimant has been with his wife  for  about  20  years  and  they
       married in June 2011. They have two sons born  in  January  1994  and
       December 1995. The claimant's wife has two  older  children  and  the
       claimant is their stepfather. She suffers from depression and asthma.
       The claimant is diabetic and takes insulin. He may be  developing  an
       eye problem and renal failure.

    6. The claimant appealed  against  the  Secretary  of  State's  decision
       claiming that it would breach his Article 8 human  rights  to  family
       life and his Article 3 and 8 human rights because  he  would  not  be
       able to obtain adequate treatment for his diabetes in Jamaica.

    7. The panel held the appeal  on  12  August  2013.  Both  parties  were
       represented. The panel heard evidence from the  claimant,  his  wife,
       his sister, his mother and his elder son. There were statements  from
       other relatives including the claimant's younger  son  and  a  letter
       from the claimant's GP surgery. The panel made reference to extensive
       case law, the judges sentencing remarks, the pre-sentence report, the
       OASys report and a letter of support from the prison chaplain.

    8. The panel heard submissions from both representatives.

    9. The panel concluded that, because the claimant had been sentenced  to
       6 years imprisonment,  paragraph  398(a)  of  the  Immigration  Rules
       applied. Paragraphs 399 and 399A did not apply and it would  only  be
       in exceptional circumstances that the public interest in  deportation
       would be outweighed by other factors. In paragraph 52 the  panel  set
       out what were considered to be the other factors before reaching  the
       conclusion that there were such exceptional circumstances.

   10. The panel went on to consider the  Articles  3  and  8  human  rights
       grounds outside the Immigration Rules reaching  the  conclusion  that
       the Article 8 claim succeeded but the Article 3 claim did not because
       the claimant had not shown that he would be unable to access  insulin
       in Jamaica or that he would have significant difficulty in  accessing
       adequate healthcare for his diabetes.

   11. The respondent sought permission to appeal which  was  refused  by  a
       judge in the First-Tier Tribunal. The  application  was  renewed  and
       granted by a Judge in the Upper Tribunal. There is one  ground  which
       submits that the panel erred in law by failing  to  give  reasons  or
       adequate reasons for the findings on material matters. These are  set
       out in more detail in the numbered paragraphs which follow.

   12. There has been no application to produce the  claimant  from  custody
       and neither he nor any member of  his  family  attended  the  hearing
       before us.  The  claimant's  solicitors  have  submitted  a  Rule  24
       response in their letter dated 28 February 2014.

   13. Ms Everett relied on the grounds of appeal. She  submitted  that  the
       claimant needed to show exceptional circumstances but had  failed  to
       do so because the  panel  did  not  give  adequate  reasons  for  the
       conclusions. She was not arguing that the reasoning or  decision  was
       perverse. In reply to our question, she accepted that in paragraph 78
       of the determination the panel  had  not  said  that  the  assistance
       required by both the claimant's parents and his wife's parents  would
       or should be  provided  by  the  claimant.  She  also  accepted  that
       paragraph 5 of the grounds was misconceived because the panel had not
       reached the conclusion that the claimant would not be able to  obtain
       appropriate medical treatment in Jamaica.  Notwithstanding  what  was
       said in paragraph 52(i) the panel reached  the  final  conclusion  in
       paragraph 82 that he had not shown that he would be unable to  access
       insulin in Jamaica or that he would have  significant  difficulty  in
       accessing adequate health care for his diabetes. She  said  that  the
       Secretary of State no longer pursued paragraph 5 of the grounds.

   14. Ms Everett questioned what the panel meant in paragraph  54  when  it
       was said that the claimant was, in effect, a "home  grown  offender".
       This was an inappropriate finding. She accepted that  the  claimant's
       children had lived here all their lives and were British citizens.

   15. We raised the question of  whether,  in  paragraph  59,  the  panel's
       pr�cis of some of the circumstances of the  index  offence  correctly
       recorded what the judge  had  said  in  his  sentencing  remarks.  Ms
       Everett said that it appeared to be factually incorrect, although she
       accepted that what was said here needed to be read in the light of  a
       substantial extract from the sentencing remarks set out in  paragraph
       42.

   16. We were asked to find that the panel had erred  in  law  and  to  set
       aside the decision. Ms Everett submitted that  we  could  remake  the
       decision without adjournment and without hearing further evidence.

   17. Mr Akindele relied on the Rule 24 response. Neither he nor Ms Everett
       could assist us as to exactly what  a  "no  time  limit  application"
       might be. Mr Akindele thought that it might be a further  endorsement
       in the claimant's passport indicating that he had indefinite leave to
       remain. He had not appeared for the claimant  before  the  panel  and
       could not say what evidence had been submitted  or  submissions  made
       about this.

   18. Mr Akindele submitted that  the  panel  made  findings  of  fact  and
       reached properly reasoned conclusions in the light  of  the  evidence
       before them. It was  clear  that  the  panel  had  followed  all  the
       appropriate Razgar steps. The  panel  had  accepted  that  the  index
       offence was a very serious offence.  Describing  the  claimant  as  a
       "home grown offender" was no more than a reflection of the fact  that
       he had been in this country for so  long.  It  was  argued  that  the
       determination was lengthy, detailed and well written. What the  panel
       said in paragraph 59 had to be read in  the  light  of  the  detailed
       extract from the judges sentencing remarks set  out  earlier  in  the
       determination. There was no material difference.  We  were  asked  to
       find that the panel had not erred in law and to uphold the  decision.
       We reserved our determination.

   19. Paragraph 1 of the grounds argues that the panel  failed  to  provide
       adequate reasons for  the  conclusion  that  there  were  exceptional
       circumstances which outweighed the public interest in deportation. We
       find that in paragraphs 51 to 55 of the determination the  panel  did
       provide clear and sufficient reasons  for  this  conclusion.  If  any
       amplification of these reasons is required it can properly  be  found
       in the detailed record  of  the  evidence  set  out  earlier  in  the
       determination. The Secretary of State's representative at the hearing
       before the panel does not appear to have suggested that the  claimant
       or his witnesses were not credible and there is  no  indication  that
       the panel did not accept their evidence. Providing  adequate  reasons
       does not mean that the panel is required to set out, in that part  of
       the determination, every aspect of the evidence  and  every  possible
       interpretation of  it.  It  is  sufficient  for  the  panel  to  make
       reference to and  outline  the  important  factors,  particularly  if
       further details can be found elsewhere in the determination. We  find
       that this is what the panel did both in relation to the challenge  in
       this paragraph of the grounds and the other  challenges  relating  to
       alleged lack of reasoning. Paragraph 1 is in substance no  more  than
       an attempt to re-argue the case without identifying any error of law.

   20. Paragraph 2 of the grounds relies on the submission that the claimant
       had to establish that there  were  insurmountable  obstacles  to  the
       family relocating to Jamaica. That is not the test. The correct test,
       applied by the panel, was whether it would be unreasonable to  expect
       the family to relocate to Jamaica. The panel gave sufficient  reasons
       for the conclusion that it would be unreasonable to  expect  them  to
       relocate in paragraph 52 (h). Paragraph 52 needs  to  be  read  as  a
       whole  and  in  the  light  of  all  the  evidence  recorded  in  the
       determination.

   21. As to paragraph 3 of the grounds which refer to paragraph 52  (e)  of
       the determination, the panel did not find that the withdrawal  of  an
       application  by  the  claimant  for  British   citizenship   was   an
       exceptional circumstance to outweigh the public interest in deporting
       him. They found that this was one of a number of  factors  which  led
       them to that conclusion. We can find no indication that the panel was
       shown any documentary evidence  as  to  the  precise  nature  of  the
       claimant's application in 2010. We accept that in  paragraph  62  the
       panel  said  that  the  claimant  was  "close  to  achieving  British
       citizenship". However, in the assessment of  the  position  following
       the deportation order the panel  did  not  make  any  finding  as  to
       whether the claimant could apply for or would  be  likely  to  obtain
       British citizenship. Whether there was  an  application  for  British
       citizenship which the claimant withdrew, for  what  appears  to  have
       been a good reason, or  an  application  for  some  sort  of  further
       documentation to record his indefinite  leave  to  remain  is  of  no
       material significance where it is common ground that the claimant  is
       still a Jamaican citizen and has never become a British citizen.

   22. In paragraph 4 of the grounds the Secretary of State argues that  the
       panel failed to provide adequate reasons for the finding in paragraph
       78 (iii) that the claimant's wife's parents required assistance.  The
       panel said; "both the appellant's and his wife's parents are  elderly
       and require assistance". The panel did not say that  that  assistance
       would or should be provided by the claimant. The claimant's wife gave
       evidence as to the ages of her parents  and  that  she  visited  them
       three times  a  week  which  is  recorded  in  paragraph  14  of  the
       determination. It was a reasonable conclusion open to the panel  that
       both sets of parents were elderly and required some assistance.

   23. Paragraph 5 of the grounds was withdrawn by Ms Everett.

   24. In paragraph 6 the Secretary of State submits that the  panel  failed
       to give adequate reasons for the conclusion set out in  paragraph  61
       that the claimant's conduct in prison had been excellent and that  he
       was making good progress with his rehabilitation. We  find  that  the
       panel gave sufficient  reasons  for  this  conclusion  based  on  the
       evidence set out in paragraph 61. Paragraph 6  of  the  grounds  also
       submits that  the  panel  failed  to  make  any  findings  about  the
       appellant's risk of harm which  had  been  assessed  as  medium,  the
       escalation in the seriousness of his offences and that he had  failed
       to take numerous previous opportunities to reform. Whilst  we  accept
       that in paragraph 52 (j) the  panel  referred  to  the  low  risk  of
       reoffending but not  the  risk  of  causing  serious  harm,  this  is
       recorded in paragraph 44  in  the  panel's  assessment  of  the  pre-
       sentence report. We find that this was taken into account as was  the
       panel's assessment of the claimant's  offending  history.  The  panel
       properly assessed the seriousness of the  index  offence  as  appears
       from paragraph 59.

   25. In relation to paragraph 7 we are not sure what the  panel  meant  in
       paragraph 54 when they said that the  appellant  was  a  "home  grown
       offender". The phrase is unfortunate, lacks clarity  and  would  have
       been better avoided. Taken in context it seems to us that  the  panel
       were  emphasising  that  the  claimant  came   here   when   he   was
       approximately 16 and did not start offending until about  four  years
       later and now has strong family ties in  the  UK,  built  up  over  a
       lengthy period and no significant family  or  ties  in  Jamaica.  The
       phrase does not indicate to  us  that  the  panel  thought  that  the
       claimant "learnt" this behaviour whilst in the  UK,  as  the  grounds
       suggest.

   26. As to paragraph 8 of the grounds we find  that  the  panel  did  give
       adequate reasons for the conclusion in paragraph 78 that it would  be
       in the best interests of the claimant's younger son for him to remain
       here with both his mother and father. The panel made reference to the
       evidence that there was a close bond between  the  claimant  and  his
       father. Furthermore, we find that the panel accepted the evidence  of
       the claimant and his wife about their younger son which can be  found
       in paragraphs 11, 12, 13 and 18.

   27. Whilst it is not referred to in the grounds we raised the question of
       whether, in paragraph 59, the panel made an error of  fact  amounting
       to  an  error  of  law  when  stating;  "we  find  from   the   court
       documentation that the nature of the  appellant's  index  offence  is
       supplying class A drugs in circumstances where the Judge  found  that
       he was looking after the drugs for another and would have handed them
       back to that other person for eventual supply  on  the  streets".  We
       find that there is a minor error  of  fact  in  the  summary  of  the
       sentencing remarks.  The  sentencing  judge  did  not  say  that  the
       claimant would hand the drugs back to the person  who  gave  them  to
       him. He said that the claimant would  make  the  drugs  available  to
       those who would supply them on the streets. The panel  did  say  that
       the drugs would  be  made  available  for  "eventual  supply  on  the
       streets". We conclude that the factual error as to whether the supply
       would be via the person who originally  provided  the  drugs  to  the
       claimant or direct to the street is minor and has  made  no  material
       difference to the panel's assessment or to the outcome.

   28. We have not been asked to make an anonymity direction and can see  no
       good reason to do so.

   29. The conclusions reached were open to the panel on  all  the  evidence
       and sufficiently reasoned. We find that the panel did not err in  law
       and we uphold the determination.
