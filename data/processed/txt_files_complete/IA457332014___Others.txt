Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms Fijiwala, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Yousef on behalf of D J Webb & Co, Solicitors,
London


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant in these proceedings is the Secretary of  State,  however
    for convenience I shall refer to the parties as they  were  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The Appellants are citizens of Jamaica born on 7 January 1977, 19  July
    1971 and 2 February 2006 respectively.  The first  two  Appellants  are
    husband and wife and the Third Appellant is their son.   They  appealed
    against the Respondent's decision of  27  October  2014  refusing  them
    leave to remain in the United Kingdom. Their claims are based on  their
    family and private life and the length of their residency in the United
    Kingdom. Their applications were considered and refused under  Appendix
    FM and paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules. The Third Appellant's
    application was further  refused  under  Article  3  ECHR.   All  three
    applications were also considered outside the Rules, but it  was  found
    that there were  no  exceptional  circumstances  which  would  make  it
    appropriate to allow the Appellants to remain  in  the  United  Kingdom
    outside the Rules.  Their appeals were heard by Judge of the First-tier
    Tribunal S Aziz on 20 July 2015 and allowed under Article 8 ECHR  in  a
    decision promulgated on 31 July 2015.

 3. An application for permission to appeal was lodged and  permission  was
    granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Parkes on 18 November 2015.
     The grounds state that the First-tier Judge failed  to  give  adequate
    reasons for allowing the claims on the material before him, and why  he
    considered the freestanding Article 8 claim. The grounds state that the
    Judge at paragraph 54 states that he is considering Article  8  outside
    the Rules because the Immigration Rules are not a complete code but  he
    does not explain why the Appellants' claims  are  not  covered  by  the
    Rules.  The grounds state  that  the  Judge  failed  to  give  adequate
    consideration to MF (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 1192.  They refer to  the
    Judge erring as the Appellants' circumstances fall into  the  ambit  of
    the relevant Rules so it was incumbent on the Judge to  articulate  the
    reasons why their circumstances warranted  consideration  beyond  this.
    The grounds refer to public interest and state that the Judge failed to
    give adequate consideration to public interest and failed to  give  any
    consideration to factors such as the financial  burden  the  Appellants
    impose on the state, the fact that they remained here after their leave
    expired and they state that the Judge did not adequately deal with  the
    substance  of  Section  117B  and  so  materially  erred  in  law  when
    considering Article 8 outside the Rules.  The grounds assert  that  the
    Judge failed to give adequate  reasons  on  Section  55  and  the  best
    interests of the child.  Reference is made in the grounds to  the  case
    of E-A (Nigeria) [2011] UKUT 315 (IAC).  The  grounds  state  that  the
    Judge has failed to identify and explain  the  reasons  why  the  Third
    Appellant cannot return to Jamaica with his parents  and  continue  his
    family life there, or why he would be unable to establish a  comparable
    private life there.  They state  that  the  Judge  failed  to  adopt  a
    holistic assessment to the facts of the case.  The permission refers to
    EV (Philippines) [2014] EWCA Civ  874  and  states  that  there  is  no
    reference to paragraph 276ADE(iv) of the Immigration Rules as  applying
    to the Third Appellant.

 4. There is a Rule 24 response which, in connection with the  freestanding
    Article 8 appeal refers to Shahzad [2014] UKUT 00085  and  states  that
    the Immigration Rules, in the context of family removal cases are not a
    complete code.  The response  refers  to  the  Third  Appellant  having
    accrued nine and a half  years  continuous'  residence  in  the  United
    Kingdom and states that at paragraphs 54 and 55  of  the  decision  the
    Judge deals in detail  with  whether  the  case  should  be  considered
    outside the Rules.  With regard to public interest the response  states
    that the Judge had Section 117B of the 2002 Act at the forefront of his
    mind when undertaking his proportionality  assessment.   He  refers  to
    Section 19 of the Immigration Act 2014 at paragraph 55 and at paragraph
    75 he refers in particular to Section 117B(6) of  the  2002  Act.  With
    regard to Section 55 the response states that this ground is  merely  a
    disagreement  with  the  Judge's  finding.   The  response  refers   to
    paragraph 43 of the Judge's decision which deals  with  the  First  and
    Second Appellants` lives in Jamaica before  they  came  to  the  United
    Kingdom and the length of time they were there.

 5. The Presenting Officer made her submissions  first  of  all  submitting
    that she is not pursuing the ground  of  application  relating  to  the
    Immigration Rules not being a complete code.  She  submitted  that  the
    Judge at paragraphs 52 to 55 addressed this issue and addressed Section
    55.

 6. The Presenting Officer went on to the second and  third  grounds.   She
    referred to public interest  and  submitted  that  the  Judge  has  not
    properly applied Section 117.  The Presenting Officer referred  to  the
    case of AM (Malawi) [2015] UKUT 260 (IAC) at paragraph 13 which  states
    that the mere presence of children in the United Kingdom is not a trump
    card.  She submitted that that is how the  Judge  has  dealt  with  the
    child in this case. She then referred to Section 117D and the financial
    burden on the taxpayers if these Appellants are allowed  to  remain  in
    the United Kingdom.  She submitted that the Judge  has  not  considered
    this at all.  She submitted that when Section 117B is considered  there
    should be no distinction between adults and children so  little  weight
    should be given to the Third Appellant in this appeal.   She  submitted
    that the Judge has not  taken  a  holistic  approach  when  making  his
    decision. The Judge considered Appellant number three separately and it
    was only because of this that the three Appellants won their appeals.

 7. She submitted that when Section 117A is considered this must  apply  to
    all three Appellants.  I was referred to the case of Forman [2015] UKUT
    412 (IAC) which deals with Sections 117A to C and  states  that  public
    interest in immigration control is not  diluted  by  the  consideration
    that a person pursuing a claim under Article 8 ECHR has at no time been
    a financial burden on the state or is self-sufficient or is  likely  to
    remain so indefinitely.  The significance  of  these  factors  is  that
    where they are not present  the  public  interest  is  fortified.   She
    submitted that 117B applies in every case and I was referred to Section
    117B(6) which is referred to at  paragraph  17  in  the  said  case  of
    Forman.  Here it  is  stated  clearly  that  the  correct  analysis  of
    Sections 117A and 117B are that they apply in every case where a  Court
    or Tribunal is required to determine whether a decision made under  the
    Immigration Rules breaches a person's right to respect for private  and
    family life under Article 8 ECHR and as  a  result  would  be  unlawful
    under Section 6 of the Human Rights  Act  1998.   The  public  interest
    question is whether interference with a person's right to  respect  for
    private and family life is justified under Article 8(2) which  embraces
    the entirety of the proportionality exercise.  This paragraph  goes  on
    to state that the Tribunal concerned has no choice, it must have regard
    to the listed considerations.

 8. I was referred to the case of Deelah and Others [2015] UKUT  515  (IAC)
    which deals with Section 117B.  At paragraph 20 it is stated  that  the
    characteristic  which  links  the  considerations  listed  in   Section
    117B(1), (2), (3) and (6) is that of the public  interest.   It  states
    that public interest is multi-layered and has multiple dimensions.   It
    goes on to state that  those  aspects  of  public  interest  which  the
    legislature has identified as considerations to be taken  into  account
    as a matter of obligation, are contained in these provisions  and  must
    all be taken into account.

 9. The Presenting Officer  submitted  that  when  all  these  factors  are
    considered there must be errors in the First-tier Judge's decision.

10. I referred the Presenting Officer to paragraph 49 of the decision which
    refers to the First and Second  Appellants  being  able  to  return  to
    Jamaica.  I put to her that the decision in this claim  hinges  totally
    on the Third Appellant's situation.  The Presenting  Officer  submitted
    that the Judge has not considered the Immigration Rules  substantively.
    She has not referred to paragraph 276ADE.  What the Judge has  done  is
    consider the Appellants' situation  outside  the  Rules  only  and  she
    submitted that the Third Appellant might have been  able  to  meet  the
    terms of paragraph 276ADE of the Rules because of the length of time he
    has been in the United Kingdom so the Judge must have made an error  by
    making no detailed assessment about this.  She  submitted  that  it  is
    clear that Appellants one and two cannot meet the terms of Appendix  FM
    and if it is then found that the Third Appellant cannot meet the  terms
    of paragraph 276ADE, that  is  when  the  claim  should  be  considered
    outside the Rules but that is not what the Judge did.

11. The Appellants' representative made her  submissions  noting  that  the
    Presenting Officer  will  not  be  making  submissions  on  the  ground
    relating to the Immigration Rules forming a complete code.

12.  He  referred  to  grounds  2  and  3  and  the  Presenting   Officer's
    disagreement with the Judge's findings and how much  weight  should  be
    attached to these findings.  He submitted that there is no error of law
    in the Judge's decision.  Ground 2 states  that  the  Judge  failed  to
    consider public interest, but he  submitted  that  failure  to  mention
    Section 117B is not a legal error as long as the substance  of  Section
    117B is  applied.   He  submitted  that  the  Judge  considered  public
    interest and the substance of  the  Section  was  applied.   The  Judge
    referred to Section 19 of the 2014 Act at paragraph 55 of his  decision
    and he submitted that Section 117B(6) has also been considered by  him,
    although he has not made specific reference  to  this  Section.  I  was
    referred to paragraph 47 of the decision which refers to the First  and
    Second Appellants' lives in the United Kingdom  being  precarious.   He
    submitted that the Judge has clearly given weight to this  when  making
    his proportionality assessment.  He actually states that the First  and
    Second Appellants can return to Jamaica.

13. I was referred to paragraph 59 of the  decision  which  refers  to  the
    First and Second Appellants' appeals being unable to succeed under  the
    Immigration Rules and he submitted that the Judge considered the  three
    applications  under  the  Immigration  Rules  and   considered   public
    interest.  He submitted that the Judge's finding on public interest and
    under the Immigration Rules was open to him.

14. The representative then referred to the case of  ZH  (Tanzania)  (2011)
    UKSC 4 which states that nationality is not a trump card for a child in
    the United Kingdom.  He submitted that the  Judge  is  aware  that  the
    child is not British and that negative factors relating to the  child's
    parents can outweigh the child's best  interests,  but  the  Judge  has
    found that the best interests of the child are a primary  consideration
    and when the proportionality assessment is carried out, even  when  the
    factors against the First and Second Appellants are taken together they
    do not outweigh the child's best interests.  I asked the representative
    if the Judge actually states that in his decision.  He does  not.   The
    representative  submitted  that  the  Judge  then  considers  paragraph
    117B(6), but goes on to find that there is no public  interest  in  the
    removal of the  parents  from  the  United  Kingdom  and  it  would  be
    unreasonable to expect the child to leave the United Kingdom.

15. The representative submitted that the first two Appellants are  not  on
    benefits in the United Kingdom.  I pointed out that the Judge does  not
    appear to have considered free  health  care  on  the  National  Health
    Service and free education when he considers public interest,  but  the
    representative submitted that the Judge raised his concerns as  to  how
    the Appellants were supporting themselves and did put his mind to this.
     He submitted that the Judge gave  considerable  weight  to  the  child
    having been in the United Kingdom  for  nine  and  a  half  years.   He
    submitted that the child in six months time can register as  a  British
    citizen and this should be  given  weight,  as  should  his  length  of
    residence.

16. The representative then referred me to the case of EV  (Philippines)  &
    Ors [2014] EWCA Civ 874 submitting that although the Judge did not cite
    this case he has applied the guidance therein.  At paragraph 35 of that
    case it is stated that a decision as to what is in the  best  interests
    of children will depend on a number of a factors such as:-

    (a)  their age;

    (b)  the length of time they have been here;

    (c)  how long they have been in education;

    (d)  what stage their education has reached;

    (e)  to what extent they have become  distanced  from  the  country  to
         which it is proposed that they return;

    (f)  how renewable their connection with it may be;

    (g)  to  what  extent  they  will  have  linguistic  medical  or  other
         difficulties in adapting to life in that country; and

    (h)  the extent to which the course proposed will interfere with  their
         family life or their rights, if they have any, as British citizens.



    He submitted that the judge has considered all of these matters.

17. I asked the representative what is different in this family's situation
    when it is compared to a family where one of the  parents  gets  a  job
    abroad and the whole family  has  to  go  abroad  with  him.   This  is
    something that happens often. The representative submitted that that is
    a different situation, as in this case the Appellants will be  made  to
    leave the United Kingdom.  He submitted that  the  Judge  considers  to
    what extent the child is distanced from Jamaica. He submitted  that  it
    is clear that the Judge has considered the terms of the said case of EV
    (Philippines).

18. The representative submitted that the Judge  has  referred  to  social,
    cultural and educational ties to the United Kingdom in his decision and
    has applied various parts of relevant  jurisprudence,  particularly  to
    Section 117B(6) when he allowed the  appeal.   He  submitted  that  his
    findings were open to him and there is no error of law in the decision.

19. The Presenting Officer submitted that at paragraph 47 of  the  decision
    there is no reference to Section 117B.  The  Judge  stresses  that  the
    Appellants only ever had temporary leave  in  the  United  Kingdom  and
    refers to their private/family life being established while their leave
    was precarious.  He also mentions that it is not clear  how  they  have
    been supporting themselves since their leave  expired.   She  submitted
    that the Judge does not appear to have considered the  fact  that  this
    family could well be a burden on the state.   They  may  already  be  a
    burden on the state or they  may  have  been  working  illegally.   She
    submitted that at paragraph 59 the Judge makes it clear that the  First
    and Second Appellants can  go  back  to  stay  in  Jamaica.   They  are
    overstayers.  Their private lives were established  when  they  had  no
    leave to remain in the United Kingdom.  She  submitted  that  there  is
    nowhere in the 2002 Act which states that Section 117B does  not  apply
    to a child. She submitted that the representative has stated  that  the
    child is  six  months  away  from  being  able  to  apply  for  British
    nationality, but she submitted that  the  considerations  will  be  the
    same, even if he gets British nationality.  This would  not  strengthen
    the claim.  I was again referred to EV (Philippines) at  paragraph  35.
    She submitted that the Judge did not consider the factors  narrated  in
    this paragraph.  She submitted  that  the  Judge  should  have  decided
    whether this child is at a crucial stage in his education  and  whether
    he can integrate into Jamaica. She submitted that  the  Judge  has  not
    assessed proportionality properly relating to the Third Appellant.  She
    has not weighed his rights against public interest and his situation in
    the United Kingdom.

20. The representative submitted that the Presenting Officer is relying  on
    Section 117B applying to the child.  He submitted that  limited  weight
    has to be given to a precarious private life and  that  the  first  two
    Appellants have never had a legitimate expectation  of  being  able  to
    remain in the United Kingdom, but that cannot be said  for  the  child.
    He submitted that it is clear from the Act that the  child  has  always
    been in the United Kingdom and has had an expectation of being able  to
    remain here.  The child had no control over  his  time  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  He submitted that the Judge has looked at this  sensibly  and
    carried out a proper assessment.  He submitted that it is up to  me  to
    decide if the decision makes sense and if the Judge has considered  all
    the relevant factors, but based on what was before him he was  entitled
    to come to the decision he did.

Decision and Reasons

21. I have to decide if there is a material error of law in the First  Tier
    Judge's decision. I have to  decide  if  he  dealt  properly  with  the
    application of the Immigration Rules and public interest,  taking  into
    account the relevant country guidance. I have to decide if he was right
    to consider the claims outside the Rules and  if,  when  doing  so,  he
    dealt satisfactorily with Sections 117A-D and I have to decide  if  the
    child's best interests have been dealt with adequately. The Judge  does
    not require to refer to Sections 117A-D specifically, in his  decision,
    as long as he has considered their substance.

22. It is clear from the decision that had the claim related  only  to  the
    First and Second Appellants, the terms of the Rules could not have been
    satisfied and the appeals would have been dismissed (paragraphs  43  to
    47 of the decision).  At paragraph 49 the Judge states that he sees  no
    reason why the First and Second Appellants could not return to  Jamaica
    to re-establish a life for themselves.  The Judge  then  considers  the
    Third Appellant separately. He has not adopted a holistic  approach  to
    the three Appellants'  rights  and  weighed  them  all  against  public
    interest. The Appellants` representative states that the  terms  of  EV
    (Philippines) have been considered by the Judge but  when  the  factors
    relating to the best interests of the child, listed in that  case,  are
    considered the Judge has not taken these into account.  The child is 9�
    years old, so will have started in primary education when he  was  five
    so he has been in primary education  for  4�  years.   This  is  not  a
    crucial stage in his education.  He has been  brought  up  by  Jamaican
    parents and English is spoken in Jamaica.  He will be removed with  his
    parents so his family life will not be affected and  he  is  young  and
    will be able to integrate into society in Jamaica.

23. It is clear that the Third Appellant might have been able to  meet  the
    terms of the Rules, (paragraph  276ADE)  but  the  Judge  has  made  no
    mention of this although he has made it clear that the First and Second
    Appellants cannot meet the terms of the Rules. The  judge  should  have
    dealt with all the claims under the Rules before considering Article  8
    outside the Rules.

24. All of the issues have to be considered within the Rules  and  balanced
    against public interest when proportionality is  assessed.   The  Judge
    states that there is  no  public  interest  in  the  removal  of  these
    Appellants but he has not  taken  into  account  effective  immigration
    control or the burden this family are likely to be on the State and the
    fact that they will be accessing free education and free health care if
    they remain here. All of these issues are covered by the Rules.

25. Sections 117A and B only have to be considered when Article  8  outside
    the Rules is dealt with.  The judge has not  given  reasons  for  there
    being a good arguable case for the claims to be considered outside  the
    Rules. When Article 8 outside the Rules is considered  Sections  117A-D
    apply to all 3 Appellants. The Appellants` representative  stated  that
    the Judge has not specifically referred to Section  117B  (6).  He  has
    referred to it at paragraph 75 but he has not explained why he finds it
    would not be reasonable for the third Appellant  to  leave  the  United
    Kingdom. The Appellants' representative states that  the  substance  of
    Section 117B is contained in the decision  but  when  the  decision  is
    analysed that is not the case.

26. The Judge has referred to a number of matters which must weigh  against
    the Appellants` appeals  succeeding,  such  as  the  First  and  Second
    Appellants only having temporary leave in the United Kingdom  and  then
    having no leave at all and the  fact  that  when  they  had  the  Third
    Appellant their status in the United Kingdom was precarious.  All these
    findings have to be taken together and weighed against the child's best
    interests.  The Appellants` representative stated that  the  Judge  did
    this and found that they do not outweigh the child's best interests but
    there is nothing in the decision to indicate that the  judge  has  done
    this. Nowhere in the decision is this  mentioned.  The  Judge  has  not
    taken into  account  various  important  public  interest  issues  when
    carrying out his proportionality assessment.

27. A child must not be blamed for matters for which he is not responsible,
    e.g. the conduct of his parents but there  is  nothing  exceptional  in
    this case and based on what was  before  the  judge  it  would  not  be
    unreasonable for the Third Appellant to go to Jamaica. He will be going
    with his parents.  There are no compelling reasons for this family  not
    returning to Jamaica and having a child should not  be  regarded  as  a
    trump card. That is what the First and  Second  Appellants  have  based
    their claims on and that is why the judge has allowed the appeals. This
    must be an error.

28. Although the Third Appellant, in six  months,  can  apply  for  British
    nationality  I  do  not  find  that  even  if  he  is  granted  British
    Nationality this application can succeed.  This is the only fact  which
    will have changed.

29. The Judge has not considered the claims properly under the  Rules.  The
    terms of the Rules cover all the issues in these claims. The judge  has
    given no good reason for finding that the claims should  be  considered
    outside the Rules and when he does  consider  the  claims  outside  the
    Rules he has not dealt adequately with the public interest question  or
    the relevant country guidance cases and  has  not  properly  considered
    Sections 117A-D.

Decision

30. I find that  there  are  material  errors  of  law  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's decision.

31. I find that had the judge considered  the  claims  properly  under  the
    Rules and had he dealt properly with public interest and  the  relevant
    country guidance when making his decision the judge would have  reached
    a different conclusion.

32. The First-tier Tribunal's decision, promulgated on 31 July  2015,  must
    be set aside.

33. No findings of the First-tier Tribunal can stand. Under  s.12  (2)  (b)
    (i) of the 2007 Act and Practice Statement 7.2 the nature and extent of
    judicial fact finding necessary for the decision to be remade  is  such
    that it is appropriate to remit the case to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.
    The member of the First-tier Tribunal chosen to reconsider the case are
    not to include Judge Aziz.

34. Anonymity has been directed.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
