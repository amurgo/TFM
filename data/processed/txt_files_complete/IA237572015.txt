For the Respondent:    Mr L Tarlow, a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a national of India who was born on 7  February  1984.
    On 8 January 2010 the appellant entered the United Kingdom on a Tier  4
    (General) Student visa valid until 16 April 2012.  On 5 April  2012  he
    applied for further leave to remain as  a  Tier  4  (General)  Student.
    This application was refused on 30 April 2012.  The  appellant  applied
    again on 19 May 2012 for leave to remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student.
     That application was granted on 31 July 2012  and  the  appellant  was
    granted leave to remain until 10 September 2014.  On 2  September  2014
    the appellant applied for leave to remain based  upon  his  family  and
    private life in the UK.  The appellant in that application said that he
    had a partner, Nirmala Beeharee a  Mauritian  national  whose  date  of
    birth is 2 January 1985.  He said that they had married on  24  October
    2012.

 2. The respondent refused the appellant's  application.   The  refusal  of
    that application was based  on  the  respondent's  assertion  that  the
    appellant had obtained his leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  4  (General)
    Student on 31 July 2012 by deception.  As a result  the  appellant  was
    not found to meet the suitability  requirements  for  consideration  of
    limited leave to remain in the UK either as a partner or as  a  parent.
    The respondent also indicated that the appellant did not qualify  as  a
    partner because his partner was not a British  citizen  in  the  United
    Kingdom or present and settled in the United  Kingdom.   The  appellant
    was not considered to meet the requirements of paragraph 276ADE in  any
    event  because  there  were  no  very  significant  obstacles  to   the
    appellant's reintegration into India.

The appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

 3. The appellant appealed against the Secretary of State's decision to the
    First-tier Tribunal.

 4. In a decision promulgated on  17  May  2017  First-tier  Tribunal  P  B
    Conrath dismissed the appellant's appeal.  The appeal was considered on
    the papers of the request of the appellant.

 5. The appellant applied for permission to appeal against  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's decision.  On 1  December  2017  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Pickup granted the appellant permission to appeal.

The hearing before the Upper Tribunal

 6. At the commencement of the hearing  I  considered  an  application  for
    permission to add further grounds of appeal that had been sent  to  the
    Upper Tribunal on 15 January 2018.  Essentially  the  appellant  sought
    permission to file supplementary  grounds  of  appeal  which  were  not
    considered by the First-tier Tribunal  Judge.   It  is  submitted  that
    there is a material error of law arising from a procedural  unfairness.
    In essence the appellant argued  that  the  judge  failed  to  consider
    properly the material with regard to the evidence concerning the use of
    deception to obtain his TOIEC certificate.  Reliance is placed  on  the
    case of Chen  paper  appeals  proving  dishonesty  [2014]  UKUT  00236.
    During consideration of this preliminary matter Mr Bellara considered a
    document referred to by the judge in the decision  which  set  out  the
    appellant's test score results.  This is a document that the  appellant
    had not seen.  After considering that  document  Mr  Bellara  indicated
    that the application to amend the grounds of  appeal  was  not  pursued
    vigorously.

 7. In the grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal which were  settled
    by the appellant's legal representative there was no appeal against the
    'deception' decision.  At  paragraph  3  of  those  grounds  it  simply
    mentions that deception was a  reason  for  refusal.   In  the  witness
    statements for the appeal hearing the appellant did not dispute that he
    has used deception to obtain his TOEIC certificate.  In the grounds  of
    appeal to this  Tribunal  there  was  no  appeal  against  the  judge's
    consideration of that issue either.

 8. The  judge  considered  from  paragraphs  21  to  23  the  respondent's
    assertion that the appellant has used deception  to  obtain  his  TOEIC
    certificate and therefore to obtain his leave to remain in the UK.  The
    judge has given careful consideration to the respondent's evidence  and
    whether or not it was sufficient to satisfy the evidential burden.   As
    the judge set out:

         "This Appellant has not sought to do this  [establish  an  innocent
         explanation] at all, either in his Notice and Grounds of Appeal, or
         in his written  Witness  Statement  dated  the  23rd  August  2016.
         Consequently, I find that it has been established, on  the  balance
         of probabilities, that the Appellant's test scores were obtained on
         the 18th April 2012 by deception, and are therefore  invalid.   Not
         only  does  this  mean,  therefore,  that  he  does  not  meet  the
         'suitability' requirements for consideration  of  Leave  to  Remain
         under the Rules, but it means that he has effectively been  in  the
         United Kingdom 'unlawfully'  since  his  previous  Application  for
         Leave to Remain was refused on the 30th April 2012."

    There  was  no  error  of  law  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal   Judge's
    consideration of this issue.

 9. For the reasons set out  above  I  do  not  grant  permission  for  the
    appellant to amend his grounds of appeal.

10. The grounds of  appeal  are  focused  on  the  best  interests  of  the
    appellant's child.  As set out in the  First-tier  Tribunal's  decision
    the appellant had a child born on 7 December 2014.  It is asserted that
    the judge has not adequately considered the effects of removal  on  the
    child and has not considered and made findings as to what  the  child's
    best interests are.

11. It is also asserted  that  the  judge  erred  by  failing  to  consider
    appropriately the  situation  of  the  appellant's  wife,  a  Mauritian
    national, with no links to India who cannot possibly go and  settle  in
    India  to  be  with  her  husband.   This  should  be   considered   an
    insurmountable obstacle to returning to India to live there.   In  oral
    submissions Mr Bellara relied on the grounds of  appeal  and  submitted
    that the appellant's child was a British citizen.   He  indicated  that
    the child's passport had been produced before the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge.  To justly dispose of the appeal the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    was required to assess what the best interests of the child  were.   In
    this case there is no consideration at all for what that  child's  best
    interests are.  With regard to insurmountable  obstacles  he  submitted
    that the best interests issue overlaps on the basis of family  life  in
    the UK and failure to consider the effect on the  family  life  if  the
    appellant is removed.  Mr Bellara  referred  to  paragraph  12  of  the
    grounds of appeal where it is asserted that the judge should  not  have
    considered that the appellant's relationship was entered into while  he
    was in the UK unlawfully.  He submitted that  it  is  unreasonable  and
    unfair for the judge to raise this issue of his own accord.  Mr Bellara
    accepted that in fact the appellant was in the UK unlawfully after  his
    previous application for leave to remain was refused on 30  April  2012
    and did not pursue this further.

12. Mr Tarlow relied on the Rule 24 response which asserts that  the  judge
    did properly consider the best interests of the child and relocation to
    India.  In any event the child is not expected to leave the UK with the
    appellant as the child can remain in the UK with  the  mother  who  has
    ILR.  This is a case in which separation is justified given the adverse
    findings against the appellant in respect of deception  employed  in  a
    previous application and these findings have not been  challenged.   Mr
    Tarlow  submitted  the  fact  that  the  appellant  cannot   meet   the
    suitability requirements has a bearing on the situation with regard  to
    the child.  The appropriate course of action is for  the  appellant  to
    make a fresh application from abroad.

13. Mr Bellara submitted that whilst suitability is important the fact that
    the judge makes no reference at all to the best interests of the  child
    cannot be overcome.  The judge was required to consider  carefully  the
    duty under Section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and  Immigration  Act
    to consider the best interests of the child.   He  submitted  that  the
    sins of the  parents  has  to  be  considered  very  carefully  in  the
    proportionality exercise.

Discussion

14. In an otherwise carefully reasoned  decision  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge in this case has simply failed to consider the best interests  of
    the appellant's child.  The judge at paragraph 27 went on  to  consider
    the appellant's claim outside of the Immigration  Rules  and  correctly
    set out the approach in Razgar.  The judge accepted that the  appellant
    has a son born on 7 December 2014 who at the time of the hearing was 2�
    years  old.   The  judge  accepted  that  refusal  of  the  appellant's
    application will cause a serious interference in his family and private
    life.  When considering Section 117B of the Immigration Act 2014, which
    inserted this provision into the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum
    Act  2002,  the  judge  considered  the  weight  to  be  given  to  the
    appellant's private life.  In paragraph 34 the judge considered that:

         "I accept that any requirement for the Appellant to  leave,  whilst
         he returns to India and makes what would be a fresh Application for
         Entry Clearance as a 'Partner' and/or 'Parent' will cause both  him
         and his wife, and his son some degree of hardship."

15. That is the only substantive consideration of the effect of removal  of
    the appellant on his son.  This is woefully inadequate in terms of  the
    consideration of a child's best interests.  It is not  clear  that  the
    judge considered at all what those  interests  are  before  reaching  a
    decision.

16. I find  that  the  failure  to  consider  the  best  interests  of  the
    appellant's child is a material error of law and  I  set  the  decision
    aside.

17. I find that there is a material error of law in the First-tier Tribunal
    decision. I set that decision aside pursuant to section 12(2)(a) of the
    Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 ('TCEA').

18. I considered whether or not I could  re-make  the  decision  myself.  I
    considered the Practice Statement concerning transfer  of  proceedings.
    As there have been no findings of fact or proper consideration  of  the
    child's best interests after  considering  whether  I  could  make  the
    decision myself I accepted  that  there  would  need  to  be  a  fuller
    consideration and findings.  I am satisfied that the nature and  extent
    of judicial fact finding that is necessary in order for the decision in
    the appeal to be re-made is  such,  having  regard  to  the  overriding
    objective, that it is appropriate to remit the matter to the First-tier
    Tribunal.

19. There are two findings in the First-tier Tribunal's decision  that  are
    preserved.  Firstly, at paragraph 23 the judge found "I  find  that  it
    has  been  established,  on  a  balance  of  probabilities,  that   the
    Appellant's test scores  were  obtained  on  the  18th  April  2012  by
    deception, and are therefore invalid."

20. Secondly the finding that the appellant has been in the United  Kingdom
    unlawfully since his previous  application  for  leave  to  remain  was
    refused on 30 April 2012 is also preserved.

21. It was not clear to me the basis  on  which  the  child  is  a  British
    Citizen. I indicated that this needs to be established at  the  hearing
    and that I would give a direction to that effect.

22. I remit the case to the First-tier Tribunal for the case to be heard at
    the First-tier Tribunal  at Taylor House before any judge   other  than
    Judge Conrath  pursuant to section 12(2)(b) and 12(3)(a) of the TCEA. A
    new hearing will be fixed at the next available date.

23. No anonymity direction is made.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains a material  error  of  law.
The decision is set aside. The case is remitted to the  First-tier  Tribunal
to be re-heard with two findings preserved as set out above.

Direction

The child's passport or other  evidence  to  prove  that  he  is  a  British
citizen should be filed with the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  served  on  the
respondent.
