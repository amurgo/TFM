Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms A Everett, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr C Jacobs, Counsel, instructed by Minority
                    Development & Advocacy

                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

 1. The appellant is a citizen of the United States of America, born  on  1
    January 1980, who appealed the decision of an Entry  Clearance  Officer
    dated 25 January 2016 to refuse the appellant's application  for  entry
    clearance as a  partner  under  Appendix  FM  on  the  basis  that  the
    appellant  had  failed  to  evidence  that  there  would  be   adequate
    maintenance and accommodation available to the appellant.

 2. In a decision promulgated on 20  June  2017  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Miles allowed the appellant's appeal on human  rights  grounds
    under Article 8 ECHR, which, it was not disputed, was the  only  ground
    of appeal.

 3. The appellant before the First-tier Tribunal was Mr Zakaria Ahmed  Ali.
    The appellant  before  the  Upper  Tribunal  was  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer.  However, for the purposes of  this  Decision  and  Reasons  I
    refer to the parties as they were before the First-tier Tribunal.

 4. The Secretary of State appeals with permission on the grounds that:

      1) Ground 1: the judge made a material misdirection in law in allowing
         the appeal on the basis that that appellant automatically satisfies
         the financial requirements by virtue of the receipt by the  sponsor
         of the carer's allowance;

      2) It was further submitted that the  Tribunal  erred  in  failing  to
         provide adequate reasons as  to  why  the  appeal  succeeded  under
         Article 8, particularly as the couple have lived apart  for  almost
         ten years with no attempt by the couple to  be  reunited  and  that
         this had been a choice and the decision  caused  no  breach  as  it
         simply maintains the status quo.

Error of law discussion

 5. Mr  Jacobs  accepted  that  the  provisions  of  EC-P.1.1  required  an
    applicant, in addition to showing that their partner was in receipt  of
    one of the qualifying benefits (it is not disputed that the sponsor  is
    in receipt of carer's allowance) also had to show, under  E-ECP.3.3(b),
    that their partner was able to maintain themselves, the  applicant  and
    any dependants adequately in the UK without recourse to public funds.

 6. The Tribunal Judge misdirected himself in stating, as he did at page  3
    of  the  Decision  and  Reasons  (in   which   the   paragraphs   were,
    unfortunately, unnumbered) that the financial requirements of  Appendix
    FM can be satisfied where the applicant's  partner  is  in  receipt  of
    carer's allowance, E-ECP.3.3(a)(v).  He failed to give adequate reasons
    or  indeed  any  reasons  as  to  why  the  appellant   satisfied   the
    requirements for adequate maintenance and accommodation or  to  address
    the respondent's concerns that, following  the  relevant  formula,  the
    appellant's income was not adequate.

 7. Although Mr Jacobs submitted that the error was not material given  the
    evidence before me I do not agree.  The First-tier Tribunal  failed  to
    consider the  evidence  as  to  whether  the  funds  available  to  the
    appellant and his sponsor were adequate, given that the judge continued
    under the misdirection that receipt of carer's allowance was sufficient
    in itself.

 8. Although this was an appeal under Article 8 and the judge gave  reasons
    (including  the  history  of  the  case  and  that  the  appellant  had
    previously been granted limited leave  as  the  sponsor  and  this  was
    interrupted by him being required to return to  the  United  States  to
    care for his sick father and that the couple  have  a  disabled  child,
    whose welfare must be given significant weight)  the  judge  also  took
    into consideration that in his findings the requirements of Appendix FM
    were met.  It cannot  be  said,  therefore,  that  the  decision  would
    inevitably have been the same if he had properly considered  the  issue
    of adequacy of maintenance.



Error of law

 9. I find, therefore, a material error of law in the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal.  I preserve the Tribunal's findings of fact  other  than
    the finding that the receipt of carer's allowance is enough  in  itself
    to satisfy the requirements of E-ECP.3.3.

Remaking the Decision

10. Both parties before me confirmed  that  they  were  in  a  position  to
    proceed.  I heard oral evidence from the sponsor, who gave evidence  in
    English and adopted her witness statement.  The sponsor  gave  evidence
    in relation to  the  benefits  that  she  is  in  receipt  of  and  her
    representatives also provided a handwritten schedule  to  the  Tribunal
    setting out how it was argued the appellant  would  now  have  adequate
    maintenance available to him.

11. Ms Everett accepted that the Tribunal  could  take  into  consideration
    matters arising after the  date  of  the  decision;  the  decision  was
    reached after 6 April 2015  by  virtue  of  the  Immigration  Act  2014
    (Commencement No. 4, Transitional and Saving Provisions and  Amendment)
    Order 2015, 2015 No. 371 (C. 18) there is no longer  a  restriction  on
    consideration of evidence restricted to the date of decision.

12. In terms of adequacy of  maintenance  it  was  not  disputed  that  the
    relevant formula is as set out by the respondent in the refusal  letter
    (see Ahmed (benefits; proof of receipt;  evidence)  [2013]  UKUT  00084
    (IAC)) i.e. that the formula is A minus B and this must be greater than
    or equal to C; where A is the projected net income after  deduction  of
    income tax and national insurance contributions, B  is  housing  costs,
    i.e. what needs to be spent on accommodation, and C is  the  amount  of
    income support that would be received by a British family of equivalent
    size.

13. The appellant's representative provided  figures  for  the  sponsor  as
    follows:

|Benefits received per Week                          |
|Child tax credit                |�279.00  |         |
|Child benefit                   |�61.00   |         |
|Carer's allowance               |�62.00   |         |
|Disability allowance �310 � 4 = |�77.50   |         |
|Housing benefit                 |�149.00  |         |
|Total per week                  |         |�628.50  |

|Income Support per Week                             |
|Couple:                         |�114.85  |         |
|Dependent children �66.90 x 4 = |�267.60  |         |
|Family premium                  |�17.45   |         |
|Carer premium                   |�34.60   |         |
|Disabled child                  |�60.06   |         |
|Total                           |         |�494.56  |


14. The sponsor's net income therefore is �628.50.  The housing  costs,  in
    my findings, are �149.  The sponsor confirmed in oral evidence that she
    did not pay any additional housing costs and the �149 benefit per  week
    for housing was the sum total of her  housing  costs.   Therefore,  the
    calculation must be �628.50 minus �149, giving a total of �478.  It was
    not disputed before me that this is just  (almost  �17)  of  the  total
    requirement of �494.56, the amount of  income  support  that  would  be
    received by a British family of equivalent size.

15. However, there was also considerable evidence before me in relation  to
    the financial position of the appellant in the United States, including
    evidence of savings in the UK of almost �5,000 and evidence  of  income
    in  the  United  States  of  approximately  $4,000  a  month  and  bank
    statements indicated  that  the  sponsor  had  fluctuating  amounts  of
    savings in his US bank account and that as of 11 May 2017 there  was  a
    balance of $7,000 in his account.  I accept, including relying  on  the
    documentary evidence and the consistent oral evidence of  the  sponsor,
    which  was  not  substantively  challenged  by  Ms  Everett,  that  the
    appellant's financial circumstances are as  claimed.   In  addition,  I
    accept the evidence of the sponsor, which  again  was  not  challenged,
    that her husband also owns a truck worth approximately  $40,000,  which
    is an asset he intends to sell when he is in a position  to  enter  the
    UK.

16. Ms Everett could not point to any provision to support  the  contention
    that the appellant was unable to rely on his own  savings  and  assets,
    ensuring that there was adequate maintenance.

17. It was not disputed and I  preserve  the  findings  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge that the  appellant  had  demonstrated  that  there  was
    adequate accommodation available to the family and these findings  were
    not challenged.  Considering the totality of the documentary  and  oral
    evidence before  me  I  am  satisfied  that  the  appellant  meets  the
    requirements of Appendix FM E-ECP.3.3(a) and  (b)  and  that  there  is
    adequate maintenance and accommodation  available  to  the  sponsor  to
    maintain the appellant and any dependants without  recourse  to  public
    funds.  Even if I am wrong in relation to the ability of the  appellant
    to rely on his own assets and savings, such is not fatal to my ultimate
    conclusion that this appeal falls to be allowed.

18. Under Article 8 I have applied the five-stage test set  out  in  Razgar
    [2004].  I am satisfied that family life exists and  has  continued  to
    exist.  I accept the oral and written evidence of  the  sponsor  and  I
    also had the benefit of a witness statement from the appellant.  It  is
    clear that the relationship between the couple has endured despite  the
    fact that they have lived apart for ten  years  and  the  sponsor  gave
    evidence that during the winter the appellant would come to the  UK  to
    stay for an extended period and during the summer she and the  children
    would travel to the US and that their lives had continued in this  way.
    I accept the reasons why the appellant had to leave  the  UK  in  2006,
    given that his father suffered a heart attack in the United States, and
    that he was then unable to return on his two year spousal visa.   I  am
    satisfied that the decision of the Entry Clearance  Officer  interferes
    with that family life and given the low  threshhold  would  potentially
    constitute a breach of Article 8.  The decision is in  accordance  with
    the law and for the purposes of immigration control.  I turn  therefore
    to whether or not the decision is proportionate.

19. In so doing I take into consideration the provisions of Section 117  of
    the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, the  public  interest
    considerations applicable in all cases.  I accept that the  maintenance
    of effective immigration control is in the public interest.  It was not
    disputed  that  the  appellant  could  speak  English  and  Ms  Everett
    confirmed that  she  took  no  point  in  this  regard.   I  have  also
    considered that it is in the public interest that  persons  seeking  to
    enter the  UK  are  financially  independent.   In  considering  in  my
    findings that the appellant is  financially  dependent,  therefore,  no
    weight is attached to the public interest in this regard.  I take  into
    consideration that he has  considerable  savings,  that  he  previously
    worked in the UK and intends to work on his return and in addition  the
    combination of his savings and the benefits to  which  the  sponsor  is
    entitled are sufficient to adequately maintain the appellant such  that
    he will be financially independent.

20. I accept the sponsor's  evidence  that  she  received  poor  advice  in
    relation to the appellant's re-entry to the UK.  Although I accept that
    the regime in relation to the  requirements  of  Appendix  FM  and  the
    maintenance level did not come into force until 2012 when the appellant
    has been outside the UK since 2006,  the  sponsor  was  candid  in  her
    evidence that she was unsure when exactly she and the appellant started
    their research and obtained advice in relation to his return to the UK.
     I also take into consideration that the evidence  indicates  that  the
    appellant tried to return to London on his original visa  and  had  not
    realised that it was no longer valid given his absence from the UK.

21. The sponsor  also  gave  evidence  that  the  sponsor's  mother  had  a
    difficult relationship with the appellant and this in part affected the
    decision to return although I note the application to return  was  made
    in September 2015, prior to the death of the sponsor's mother in August
    2016.  I accept that the sponsor may  well  have  received  (erroneous)
    evidence prior to that date and indeed prior to 2012 that at that point
    they did not meet the financial threshold because she had become a full-
    time  carer.   I  further  accept  the   evidence   that   the   couple
    realistically considered the prospect  of  the  family  moving  to  the
    United States but that they took into consideration that this would  be
    potentially damaging to the health and development of their son I,  who
    has been diagnosed with autism.  Such was not disputed.   The  life  of
    the family has continued through these visits and indeed three or  four
    of their children have been born whilst the appellant has been residing
    overseas.  However, I am satisfied that the separation is  not  one  of
    choice and that throughout this time it has been the intention  of  the
    family  to  reunite  subject  to  obtaining  the  correct   immigration
    permission.

22. In considering the  appellant's  appeal  I  have  considered  the  best
    interests of the children  as  a  primary  consideration.   Absent  any
    evidence to the contrary it is in  the  children's  best  interests  to
    reside with both parents and I accept that this is  the  case  in  this
    appeal.  All the evidence both  oral  and  documentary  points  to  the
    appellant and the sponsor both being committed parents to all of  their
    children and I take into consideration that there were  letters  before
    me from the children indicating that they want their father to stay  in
    the UK for good.  There was also evidence in  the  form  of  a  medical
    letter for I dated 17 May 2017 which confirmed  that  he  suffers  from
    autism, developmental delay and weakness in his muscles.  It  indicated
    that his mother struggles to care for  him,  particularly  as  he  gets
    bigger, and that he requires his father's help.  I  am  satisfied  that
    the best interests of the children are best served  in  being  reunited
    with their father.

23. Taking  into  consideration  all  the  factors,  including  that  I  am
    satisfied  that  on  balance  that  the  maintenance  requirements  are
    satisfied and that the appellant therefore meets  the  requirements  of
    Appendix FM (and even if they were not I am of the view that this is  a
    case where refusal would be disproportionate taking  into  account  all
    the factors discussed above) I am satisfied that the appeal falls to be
    allowed.
