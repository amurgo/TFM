                            DECISION AND REASONS

1    This is an appeal brought by the Secretary of State. We shall refer  to
      the parties as they  were  before  the  First  tier.   The  Respondent
      appeals against the decision  of  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
      Gandhi dated 29 June 2015 allowing the Appellant's  appeal  against  a
      decision of the Respondent dated 3 February 2014 refusing to grant him
      a residence  card  under  the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
      Regulations 2006 ('the  EEA  Regulations')  as  the  spouse  of  Laura
      Stefanaviciute, a Lithuanian national ('the Sponsor').

2    The Appellant has an adverse immigration and criminal history.   He  is
      a national of Albania and first entered the  United  Kingdom  in  1998
      claiming  asylum.   That  application  was  unsuccessful,  the  appeal
      against asylum having been dismissed finally on 25 March 2002.  He had
      a previous partner Ms Brunilda Zeneli with whom he had a  son.   Leave
      to remain was sought  on  the  basis  of  that  relationship  but  the
      Appellant has convictions in the  United  Kingdom,  most  pressing  of
      which is that on 9 March 2009 he was convicted  at  Snaresbrook  Crown
      Court for grievous bodily harm for  which  on  7  April  2009  he  was
      sentenced to four years' imprisonment.

3     That  lead  to  deportation  proceedings  against  the  Appellant.   A
      decision made under Section 32 of the UK Borders Act 2007 was made  on
      3 August 2012 resulting in an appeal which was dismissed on 11 January
      2013.  Shortly prior to that decision and following the  breakdown  in
      his relationship with Ms Zeneli  the  Appellant  had  entered  into  a
      relationship with the Sponsor, later marrying her on 13  August  2013.
      Notwithstanding the dismissal of his deport appeal, the Appellant made
      an application on 11 March 2013 for a residence  card  under  the  EEA
      Regulations.

4    That application was  refused  by  the  Respondent  for  two  principle
      reasons.  Firstly that the Respondent did not accept that the  Sponsor
      was a qualified person under the EEA Regulations on the  grounds  that
      they were not satisfied on the evidence adduced that the  Sponsor  was
      economically active and asserting her rights of  free  movement  under
      the EEA Regulations. Secondly, due the  Appellant's  conviction  of  9
      March 2009, there were reasons of public security,  public  policy  or
      public health  which  under  Regulation  20  of  the  EEA  Regulations
      justified the refusal of the grant of such a residence card.

5    The Appellant appealed against that decision.  The  appeal  first  came
      before a judge of the First-tier Tribunal on 23 July 2014 resulting in
      the dismissal of that appeal, but the matter was then appealed to  the
      Upper Tribunal which on 18 December  2014  held  that  the  First-tier
      Judge had erred in law, set aside  that  decision,  and  remitted  the
      appeal for a re-hearing before the First-tier.  In that way the matter
      came before Judge Gandhi at Hatton Cross on 29 June 2015.

6    The Appellant gave evidence in that appeal  as  did  his  wife.   Other
      witnesses were also called; two different employers of the Appellant's
      wife.  In a detailed decision the Judge set out the evidence  of  each
      of the witnesses  in  particular  dealing  with  the  details  of  the
      Appellant's wife's employment.  That evidence was complex, there being
      two  different  sets  of  employers.   The  Appellant  relied  upon  a
      considerable volume of paperwork including  payslips,  P60s  and  bank
      statements in support of the proposition that his wife  was  genuinely
      employed by these two employers.  Evidence was also given in  relation
      to the Appellant's past conduct, the way that he had conducted himself
      since his conviction in 2009, and the Judge considered the Appellant's
      current risk of offending.

7    The judge was in summary satisfied on the face of  that  evidence  that
      the  Sponsor  was  a  qualified  person  and  found  by  applying  the
      principles set out in Regulation 21 of the 2006 EEA  Regulations  that
      there were not sufficient public policy reasons to justify the refusal
      of a residence card  for  the  Appellant.   We  consider  the  judge's
      reasoning in further detail below.

8    The Respondent's grounds of appeal dated 20  November  2015  raise  two
      principle issues. It  is  argued  firstly  that  there  were  material
      misdirections  of  law  in  relation  to  the  Appellant's   Sponsor's
      exercising of treaty rights. It was argued that the judge's conclusion
      that she was a qualified person was 'misconceived'.  It was said  that
      the judge had noted that there were issues with the Sponsor's evidence
      but went on to find in the Appellant's favour on what  the  Respondent
      described in the grounds as 'weak evidence'.

9    It is to be noted that at the outset of the First-tier  hearing  before
      the judge  the  Presenting  Officer  Ms  Hunjan  had  applied  for  an
      adjournment on the basis that she had only had sight of a large bundle
      of evidence relied upon by  the  Appellant  on  the  morning  of  that
      hearing.   The  bundle  had  been  filed  and  served   several   days
      beforehand, although not in strict  compliance  with  directions.  The
      judge considered the Respondent's application and refused  it  on  the
      basis that very little of the evidence contained in  that  bundle  was
      new to the Respondent. We have mentioned above  the  history  of  this
      appeal, which had come before  a  First-tier  Tribunal  and  an  Upper
      Tribunal prior to reaching Judge Gandhi.  It appears that  the  bundle
      before Judge Gandhi contained an entire copy of the bundle  which  had
      previously been placed  before  the  First-tier  and  Upper  Tribunals
      preceding it, and which had also been served on the Respondent  during
      those earlier hearings.

10   In that way Judge Gandhi found the Respondent should  have  been  fully
      aware of the nature of the evidence that the Appellant relied upon  in
      support of his appeal. She found that the  new  bundle  contained  the
      same material as previously filed and served, but with some additional
      evidence bringing matters up to date.  The  judge  recorded  the  fact
      that the Presenting Officer Ms Hunjan said that she wished not only to
      familiarise herself with the content of the bundle but also to conduct
      checks on certain of the evidence contained within  it.   However  the
      judge recorded that Ms Hunjan did not state what checks  she  intended
      to make nor are we told today by Ms Isherwood what those  checks  were
      intended to be.  The judge gave Ms Hunjan  a  considerable  period  of
      time on the day of the hearing to familiarise herself with the content
      of the bundle and the appeal,  with  the  hearing  commencing  in  the
      afternoon of that day.   It is also to be noted at paragraph 18 of the
      judge's decision  that  at  the  beginning  of  the  hearing  on  that
      afternoon Ms Hunjan confirmed that she had had enough time to  prepare
      her case.  We also  note  that  she  did  not  renew  any  adjournment
      application.

11   The Respondent's grounds of appeal to this Tribunal assert  that:  "The
      FTJ criticises  the  SSHD  for  not  conducting  HMRC  checks  on  the
      documents but had refused an adjournment application  earlier  in  the
      day to do just that."  The grounds of appeal  also  suggest  that  the
      judge should have viewed the Appellant's documents with some  caution,
      there being no evidence that the two alleged employers actually  owned
      the businesses which they stated that they ran.  It was also suggested
      that there were discrepancies in the  oral  and  documentary  evidence
      which had been unexplained, and that it was 'entirely  unclear'  given
      these discrepancies why the First-tier  Judge  found  that  there  was
      sufficient evidence without further checks to show  that  the  partner
      was exercising treaty rights.

12   The second ground of appeal relied upon by the Respondent asserts  that
      there was a failure to give adequate reasons on the material issue  of
      the Appellant's risk of  re-offending  and  his  rehabilitation.   The
      grounds assert  that  the  judge  failed  to  take  into  account  the
      seriousness of the Appellant's offence and erroneously concluded  that
      he did not pose a genuine present threat to the public.  The nature of
      the Appellant's offence  is  re-stated  within  the  grounds.   It  is
      asserted that his offence caused serious harm and that that issue  was
      given no consideration in the determination.  It was suggested that if
      the Appellant posed a low risk of re-offending this still amounted  to
      a real risk.

13   Permission to appeal  was  initially  refused  by  the  First-tier  but
      granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Kebede on 1 June  2016,  finding  that
      the first ground was arguable but noting that the  second  ground  was
      arguably a mere disagreement but granting permission on both  grounds.



14   We have had the benefit of  a  Rule  24  response  from  the  Appellant
      prepared by Ms Benitez of Counsel who was appeared before the judge.

15   Before us Ms Isherwood relies upon the Respondent's grounds of  appeal.
       She accepts that no ground of appeal has been advanced  that  it  was
      unfair or procedurally improper  for  the  judge  to  have  failed  to
      adjourn the case. Rather she reiterates some of  the  criticisms  that
      are made in the grounds of appeal of the financial documentation  that
      was relied upon by the Appellant.  She also argues in respect  of  the
      second ground that the conduct  of  the  Appellant  was  not  properly
      considered by the judge in the decision.

16   Mr Collins addressed us briefly in defence  of  the  judge's  decision,
      principally relying upon Ms Benitez's Rule 24 response.

17   Ms Isherwood did not make any submissions by way of reply.


      Discussion

18   We find that  there  is  no  material  error  of  law  in  the  judge's
      decision.  We refer below to  some,  but  by  no  means  all,  of  the
      particulars of the reasons that were given by the judge supporting her
      decision.  In relation to the status of the  Sponsor  as  a  qualified
      person, the judge  sets  out  in  detail  the  oral  evidence  of  the
      Appellant's Sponsor and of her employers.  She considers at  paragraph
      106 onwards the nature  of  the  evidence  including  the  documentary
      evidence that was relied upon.  She held  that  if  the  Sponsor  were
      fabricating evidence to advance a false claim to be  employed  it  was
      unusual that she had decided to claim to have two different  employers
      rather than one.  The judge held at  paragraph  107  that  there  were
      adequate explanations given  for  the  pattern  and  amounts  of  cash
      deposits made into the Sponsor's bank account.  This  was  not  always
      consistent with the amount of salary which she earned because she  was
      paid in cash and she used some of that cash for everyday living.

19    The  judge  noted  that  the  two  employers'  evidence  was   broadly
      consistent with the evidence relied upon  by  the  Appellant.  It  was
      noted that there  was  a  discrepancy  between  the  evidence  of  the
      Sponsor's employer at the Five Elms Caf� who had said that the Sponsor
      was paid weekly, whereas the Sponsor had  said  in  relation  to  that
      employment that she was paid monthly.  However, the  judge  considered
      the explanations given in that regard, noting that her payslips showed
      that she was being paid monthly but in  reality  she  was  being  paid
      weekly.  She held that this was not therefore  an  inconsistency  that
      affected her or her employer's credibility.  The  judge  addressed  an
      alleged discrepancy between the Sponsor's hours  of  employment  on  a
      Sunday. Further, she addressed at paragraph 113 the concern that there
      was no documentary evidence demonstrating the employers' ownership  of
      these businesses, noting that the Appellant had provided evidence from
      a variety of different websites showing that these businesses existed.



20   The Respondent had complained that  the  comparison  of  the  Sponsor's
      payslips and her P60s did not correlate in a number of  respects.   In
      meticulous  reasoning  between  paragraphs  115  and  118  the   judge
      considers this evidence and provides calculations which satisfactorily
      demonstrated that the documentary evidence was in fact consistent.

21   We  find  that  the  judge's  conclusion  at  paragraph  120  that  the
      Appellant's spouse was credible and  that  she  was  an  EEA  national
      exercising her treaty rights is entirely sustainable. We find that the
      challenge  brought  by  the  Respondent  in  that  regard  is  a  mere
      disagreement.

22   The second limb of the Respondent's challenge  relates  to  the  public
      policy reasons for refusing the Appellant a residence card.  The judge
      considers this issue at paragraph 121 to 156  of  her  decision.   The
      judge noted both negative and positive  elements  to  the  Appellant's
      character and conduct.  The Appellant has a son in the United  Kingdom
      by his previous relationship.  The judge found the evidence  given  by
      the Appellant and the Sponsor credible in  regards  to  the  frequency
      that the Appellant had contact with his son.  We find that there is no
      proper challenge to the finding in that regard.  The judge  considered
      at paragraph 126 that the Sponsor knew of the Appellant's offences  at
      the time they were  married  and  at  paragraph  127  that  her  being
      employed as a waitress or shop assistant was the sort  of  work  which
      could be carried out in any EEA country.   However the judge noted  at
      paragraph 130 that the Sponsor's exercising her treaty rights  in  the
      United Kingdom was an important consideration and that she  had  every
      right to be in the United Kingdom.

23   At paragraph133 onwards the judge considered in more detail the  nature
      of the Appellant's offence.  She held that there was a low risk of him
      re-offending.  Detailed reasons are given at  paragraphs  145  to  153
      supporting that proposition.  At paragraphs  137  and  138  the  judge
      revisited the law and the issues which are relevant in deciding  under
      the EEA Regulations whether it is proportionate and lawful  to  refuse
      to grant a residence card. She directed herself that the  Respondent's
      decision needed to be proportionate and held that the decision was not
      proportionate to the gravity of the Appellant's conduct, in  that  the
      removal  was  not  necessary  for  the  attainment  of  public  policy
      objectives sought, on the basis that she held that there was no threat
      posed by the Appellant in the United Kingdom.  She held  at  paragraph
      140 that there was no evidence that there was a  genuine  and  present
      threat from the Appellant.  At 142 she held that  there  that  was  no
      evidence of a current propensity to re-offend.

24   In conclusion we find that the judge's reasons given  in  her  detailed
      decision were entirely sustainable in  finding  that  there  were  not
      sufficient public policy reasons, applying the  principles  under  the
      Citizens Directive and the EEA Regulations 2006, to justify a  refusal
      of the residence card to which he would otherwise be entitled  as  the
      Sponsor of a qualified person.

25   We find that the grounds of appeal relied upon by the Respondent are  a
      mere disagreement with the  judge's  conclusions.   They  disclose  no
      error of law and we reject them.

     Decision

26   We therefore find no error of law in the judge's decision.  We dismiss
      the Respondent's challenge to the judge's decision, which we uphold.

No anonymity direction is made.
