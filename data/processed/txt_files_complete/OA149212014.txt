For the Respondent:    Mr J Parkinson - Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is an appeal against  a  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
       Judge M A Khan promulgated on the 4 September 2015 in which the Judge
       dismissed the appellant's appeal under both the Immigration Rules and
       Article 8 ECHR.

    2. The appellant is a citizen of Iran born on the  21  March  1946.  The
       appellant's  sponsor  is  her   adult   daughter.   The   appellant's
       application for leave to  enter  the  United  Kingdom  as  the  adult
       dependant relative of her daughter was refused by an Entry  Clearance
       Officer (ECO) on 20 October 2014.  The  application  was  refused  by
       reference to paragraphs EC-DR.1.1 (d), E-ECDR 2.4  and  E-ECDR2.5  of
       the Immigration Rules. These parts of the Rules provide:

           Section EC-DR: Entry clearance as an adult dependent relative

           EC-DR.1.1. The requirements to be met for entry clearance as  an
           adult dependent relative are that-

                (a)    the applicant must be outside the UK;

                (b)    the applicant must have made a valid application  for
                entry clearance as an adult dependent relative;

                (c)    the applicant must not fall for refusal under any  of
                the  grounds  in  Section  S-EC:   Suitability   for   entry
                clearance; and

                (d)    the applicant must meet all of  the  requirements  of
                Section E-ECDR: Eligibility for entry clearance as an  adult
                dependent relative.

           Section E-ECDR: Eligibility for  entry  clearance  as  an  adult
           dependent relative

           E-ECDR.1.1. To  meet  the  eligibility  requirements  for  entry
           clearance as an adult dependent relative all of the requirements
           in paragraphs E-ECDR.2.1. to 3.2. must be met.

           Relationship requirements

           E-ECDR.2.1. The applicant must be the-

                (a)    parent aged 18 years or over;

                (b)    grandparent;

                (c)    brother or sister aged 18 years or over; or

                (d)    son or daughter aged 18 years or  over  of  a  person
                ("the sponsor") who is in the UK.

           E-ECDR.2.2.  If  the  applicant  is  the  sponsor's  parent   or
           grandparent they must not be in a subsisting relationship with a
           partner unless that partner is  also  the  sponsor's  parent  or
           grandparent and is applying for entry clearance at the same time
           as the applicant.

           E-ECDR.2.3. The sponsor must at the date of application be-

                (a)    aged 18 years or over; and

                (b)    (i)  a British Citizen in the UK; or

                    (ii)   present and settled in the UK; or

                    (iii)  in the UK  with  refugee  leave  or  humanitarian
                    protection.

           E-ECDR.2.4. The applicant or, if the applicant and their partner
           are the  sponsor's  parents  or  grandparents,  the  applicant's
           partner, must as a result of age, illness or disability  require
           long-term personal care to perform everyday tasks.

           E-ECDR.2.5. The applicant or, if the applicant and their partner
           are the  sponsor's  parents  or  grandparents,  the  applicant's
           partner, must be unable, even with the practical  and  financial
           help of the sponsor, to obtain the required level of care in the
           country where they are living, because-

                (a)    it is not available and there is no  person  in  that
                country who can reasonably provide it; or

                (b)    it is not affordable.

    3. At paragraph 37 of the determination the Judge found:

           "On the evidence before me, on the balance of probabilities, for
           the  above-mentioned  reasons,  I  am  not  satisfied  that  the
           appellant meets all the requirements of paragraphs  EC-DR.1.1(d)
           (E-ECDR 2.5) and (E-ECDR.3.1) Appendix  FM  of  the  Immigration
           Rules  of the Immigration Rules, HC 395."

    4. In relation to Article 8 ECHR outside the Rules the  Judge  sets  out
       the Razgar questions [38] before stating at [39]:

           "In this case, the appellant does not meet the  requirements  of
           the Immigration Rules.  There is evidence  before  me  that  the
           appellant's family in the UK regularly visit her in  Iran.   The
           sponsor came to settle in the UK in  2001  and  her  husband  in
           2008.  Before the son in law came to live in the  UK  he  had  a
           longstanding medical practice in Iran.  The couple have a  young
           child born in the UK. The couple can choose to return to live in
           Iran and continue with their family life with the appellant. The
           appellant has always lived in Iran and her  family  and  private
           life is in that country."

    5. The decision under challenge is set out at paragraph 40 in which  the
       Judge dismissed the appeal. The findings at [30-39] are the 'stepping
       stones' by which the Judge arrived at that conclusion.

Discussion


    6. It  is  accepted  there  is  a  lack  of  care  demonstrated  in  the
       determination such as the use of the words 'clasped' and  'coolapsed'
       rather than 'collapsed' in [33] and the claim "The appellant made  an
       application for entry clearance to join his adoptive father who  also
       happens to be his maternal uncle, in the United Kingdom"  [31]  which
       is factually incorrect. I do not find these matters material as it is
       clear  some  are  proof  reading  errors  and  a   reading   of   the
       determination as a whole shows the Judge was aware of the real reason
       for the application and the issues at large.

    7. Ground 1 of the challenge asserts the Judge failed to make a  finding
       in relation to E-ECDR 2.4. Whilst there is no specific  finding  this
       element of the Rule is satisfied it is clear from paragraph 37 of the
       determination that the Judge does not refer to this part when setting
       out why the appeal under the Rules must fail.  It  can  be  inferred,
       therefore, that this element is met and that it had been  shown  that
       the appellant as a result of age, illness or disability requires long-
       term personal care to perform everyday tasks. No arguable legal error
       is established.

    8. Ground 2 asserts the Judge misunderstood the evidence in relation  to
       the ability of the appellant to function in her home, but the finding
       in relation to 2.4 is relevant to this issue and to  the  appellant's
       functioning as an individual, at least it appears until she has  knee
       replacement surgery.

    9. The core of the claim is that the appellant is an  elderly  lady  who
       lives in Tehran who is not coping well following  the  death  of  her
       husband in 2009. The appellant lived in her  daughter's  house  which
       unfortunately collapsed as a result of building work being undertaken
       on an adjoining plot in a negligent manner on  2  June  2014.  Papers
       have been produced together with photographs in relation to the event
       and claims arising therefrom. The value of the daughters land is said
       to be in the region of ï¿½200,000.

   10. The appellant was trapped in the rubble from  the  collapse  and  was
       saved by a neighbour. It is said that as a result of her  experiences
       the appellant has lost her  confidence  and  suffers  from  PTDS  and
       anxiety when alone and has a fear of buildings, the wind,  and  being
       alone. The appellant has mobility issues as she is not able  to  move
       around freely due  to  bad  knees  and  had  the  assistance  of  her
       neighbours to help with shopping for groceries.   The appellant is in
       a flat rented by her daughter and so the neighbour  is  unable  to  a
       help as they live elsewhere too. It is  said  the  appellant  suffers
       from depression which has resulted in her not caring for herself  and
       not asking her new neighbours for assistance as a result of which  it
       is said she has lost weight.

   11. The medical evidence was considered by the Judge.  A translation of a
       letter dated 17 June 2014 written by a Dr Semnani states:

           "This is hereby to certify that:

           Mahboubeh Sepehri suffers from acute stress disorder pursuant to
           the created incident; meanwhile  she  has  to  be  medicated  by
           medicines and family support.

           This  certificate  is  issued  upon  the  application   of   the
           interested party to submit To Whom It May Concern

           Dr Yousej Semnani

           Psychiatrist

           Medical Council No. 57085"

   12. A letter written by  a Dr Hasan Avarseji, dated 5 July  2014,  is  in
       the following terms:

           "To whom it may concern

           Mrs Mahboubeh Sepehri is a patient of mine who is  unfortunately
           suffering from a severe  form  of  PTSD  (Post-Traumatic  Stress
           Disorder).

           Her home in Tehran collapsed around four weeks ago and  she  was
           narrowly saved from rubbles.

           Since  then  she  has  severe  anxiety,  insomnia,   flashbacks,
           nightmares and depression.  She can't stay alone in a  room  due
           to constant fear of building collapsing on her.

           Considering that she is a widow and her  only  child  is  living
           abroad, she will need long-term 24 hour care preferably with her
           daughter.

           I do not recommend any other carer such as psychiatric nurse for
           her as she is psychologically very dependent  on  her  daughter.
           Using psychiatric nursing  service  on  a  long  term  basis  is
           neither practical nor affordable for this lady.

           Dr Hasan Avarseji MD

           Consultant Neurologist"

   13. A translation of the attendance of an ambulance at the  site  of  the
       collapsed property on the 2 June 2014 is provided [A's bundle p.  25-
       30].

   14. At [A's bundle. P. 34-36] is a further report written in  English  by
       Dr Moshen Mobasheri, psychologist, concerning PTSD in  the  following
       terms:

           "To whom it may concern.

           Mrs Mahboubeh Sepehri is a 68 year old lady who has  suffered  a
           very stressful experience when her house  was  demolished  about
           two months ago.   Although  she  was  rescued  by  neighbours  a
           significant mental scar has remained.

           This condition is called PTSD = Post-Traumatic Stress  disorder,
           in medical terms.

           She has flashbacks and cries a lot.

           Considering  her  associated  physical  disabilities  she  needs
           continual professional physical and mental care.

           To my knowledge this is not available in Iran.

           Dr Mohsen Mobasheri"

   15. At [A's bundle. P. 64-65] is a further medical report from Y. Semnani
       MD dated 25 July 2015 claiming that the appellant 'has  been  visited
       since June 2014 and has been prescribed mediation but it has not  had
       any definite effects'.  The  note  continues:  "It  is  advisable  to
       manage by psychiatric nursing which is not available in Iran".

   16. At [A's bundle. P. 66-68] is a letter from an orthopaedic surgeon  in
       Iran stating that the applicant has severe osteoporosis as  a  result
       of which she is house bound.  It  is  said  the  appellant  has  been
       offered total knee replacement  surgery  but  so  too  frightened  to
       undergo surgery [page 66].

   17.  It  is  said  the  Judge  erred  in  that  although  there  is  good
       physiotherapy available in  hospitals  in  Iran  facilities  are  not
       available in the home. It is also stated the Judge failed to consider
       the lack of  care  for  the  appellant's  mental  health  needs  when
       concluding at paragraph 34 of the determination:

           "The appellant's son in law said that the appellant  needs  both
           knee replacement but this cannot take  place  until  her  mental
           condition is stable. His evidence  is  that  there  are  medical
           facilities in hospitals in Iran and  home  help  can  be  hired,
           although this is not professional help as in  the  UK.   I  find
           that the appellant's needs are to be assessed in the context  of
           the circumstances in  Iran  and  not  the  United  Kingdom.  The
           appellant is in a much better situation than many other Iranians
           in that she her daughter and son in law are  in  a  position  to
           afford to hire care for the appellant. The appellant herself  is
           also financially well off in that I was told that  the  land  on
           which the family home stood is worth over ï¿½200,000."

   18. The appellant's son in law, who is an orthopaedic surgeon in the  UK,
       gave evidence that the appellant's physical condition was complicated
       by her PTSD and the fact she was not responding to treatment and that
       there could be no operation to replace the appellant's knees  in  her
       current mental state.

   19. The overall situation of the appellant was not  disputed  before  the
       Upper Tribunal.  The  Entry  Clearance  Office  in  relation  to  the
       availability of care in Iran states in the refusal notice:

           'Furthermore, if you demonstrate that you require long term care
           I must also be satisfied that this care cannot  be  received  in
           your home country. The medical issues outlined in the  documents
           provided can be treated in Iran.  A  World  Health  Organisation
           policy report into the nationwide integration of  mental  health
           into primary care states "Nationwide expansion of  primary  care
           during 1980's provided a good  opportunity  for  integration  of
           other health programmes. In 1989, mental health  was  integrated
           as a component of primary care, long before many other diseases.
            In some districts, one psychiatrist  is  available  to  provide
           specialist  mental  health  services.  Otherwise,  a   specially
           trained  practitioner  provided  mental  health  coverage.   The
           district health centre  accepts  mental  health  referrals  from
           urban and rural health centres, but sometimes  refers  difficult
           cases to the provincial health  centre.   There  are  40  health
           centres in 30 provinces - some  provinces  have  more  than  one
           medical university, who are responsible for both health services
           in the catchment area and medical education.  The mental  health
           units in these services are staffed by one psychiatrist and  one
           psychologist,   who   are   responsible   for   the   technical,
           organizational, and administrative management of the services in
           the periphery. There are also specialist mental health services,
           mostly based in psychiatric hospitals or  psychiatric  wards  of
           general  hospitals,  that  provide  mental  health  services  to
           patients from district and other urban centres.

           I note you have stated that you have 2  sisters  and  a  brother
           living in Iran and that you see  them  annually.  You  have  not
           demonstrated that they are to in a position to assist you.'

   20. At paragraph 20 of the  determination  the  Judge  records  a  matter
       arising from cross examination:

           "The sponsor said that she and her husband earn combined  income
           of ï¿½10,000 per month.  She said that she did  not  make  enquiry
           about the nursing home, she asked a friend who now lives in  the
           USA and his elderly mother is in a Nursing Home. She  said  that
           she did not know that she would need  evidence  of  any  enquiry
           concerning a nursing home. She said that she did not want to put
           her mother in a nursing home."

   21. The Upper Tribunal made it known at the hearing that it has  judicial
       notice that there are approximately 44  public  and  private  nursing
       homes in Tehran, caring for over 2,550 elderly residents in 2013. The
       cultural norm of the family providing care for the elderly  is  noted
       but this is not the case for all, and in a family where  members  are
       in the UK and family in Iran are unable to provide the degree of care
       provided the available resource cannot be ignored in  the  assessment
       of the claim.

   22. The reply recorded above highlighted the  contrasting  approaches  of
       the parties in the case. The  appellant's  stance  and  that  of  her
       sponsor is that they want to succeed and for the appellant to be able
       to join her daughter and her  family  in  the  UK.  The  respondent's
       position is that this can happen but only if it is  demonstrate  that
       the requirements of the Rules can be  satisfied.  The  appellant  has
       obtained evidence in  relation  to  her  physical  and  psychological
       issues but undertaken little investigation from all available sources
       to  shown  those  needs  cannot  be  met  in  Iran.  Whilst  this  is
       understandable  as  the  sponsor  clearly  wants  her  mother  to  be
       permitted entry, a court of Tribunal is required to consider all  the
       available evidence.

   23. Paragraph 2.5 of the Rules provides that a person must show that  the
       required level of support "must be unable, even  with  the  practical
       and financial help of the sponsor, to obtain the  required  level  of
       care in the country where they are living, because-

           (a)    it is not available  and  there  is  no  person  in  that
           country who can reasonably provide it; or

           (b)    it is not affordable."

   24. The first stage must be to furnish detailed evidence of the needs  of
       an individual. Although some material has been provided it  is  clear
       this is limited to short notes. For example, it is said the appellant
       suffers from PTSD following the collapse of her house in  2014.  PTSD
       is Post-traumatic stress disorder which is an anxiety disorder caused
       by very stressful, frightening or distressing events. Within the  NHS
       and other countries mental health services PTSD can  be  successfully
       treated, even when it develops many years after a traumatic event.

   25. Treatment options may  be  recommended  include  watchful  waiting  -
       monitoring  symptoms to see whether they improve or get worse without
       treatment,  psychotherapy  -   such   as   trauma-focused   cognitive
       behavioural  therapy  (CBT)  or  eye  movement  desensitisation   and
       reprocessing  (EMDR)  and  the  use  of  antidepressants  -  such  as
       paroxetine or mirtazapine.

   26. The evidence refers to some intervention but fails  to  comment  upon
       the criteria for diagnosis and how this is met and  to  what  degree,
       the treatment plan  in  detail  including  time  scales  and  ongoing
       intervention, the purpose of  the  medication  including  dosage  and
       actions taken to change dosages/nature of medication if  the  current
       prescription is  not  working,  whether  there  is  evidence  of  the
       appellant being compliant, whether there was any evidence  of  mental
       health issues before the collapse of the building. It  is  noted  the
       appellant has found life difficult since the death of her husband  in
       2009 but little is said of this in the evidence.

   27. In relation to PTSD, extensive research has been carried out to  show
       the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) intervention
       approaches to treating posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). There is
       no mention of this being tried and the effectiveness of the  same  in
       the medical letters, indicating an effective line of therapy may  not
       have been tried.

   28. The evidence is limited on availability of  help.  It  has  not  been
       shown help is not available. It was said at the hearing this  is  not
       the issue which is that the type of help required is not available in
       the home. If care within a residential setting is required it has not
       been shown the same cannot be sourced on a private basis if  required
       in a care home environment, if this is  the  only  available  option.
       The medical  notes  refer  to  the  fact  mental  health  nursing  is
       available but fails to provide detail of the costing to show  it,  or
       residential care, is prohibitive.   Generalised  statements  are  not
       sufficient especially when it is admitted such enquires have not been
       made as the sponsor does not want to entertain this option.

   29. The finding of the Judge that it has  not  been  shown  the  required
       level of care is not available or not affordable is within the  range
       of findings the Judge was entitled to make on the available evidence,
       in relation to both the appellant's physical and psychological needs.

   30. The Judge is criticised for finding the sponsor and her family can go
       and live in Iran to care for the appellant [39]. Whilst  this  is  an
       option if the family choose to return,  the  Judge  was  required  to
       consider that the sponsor's child is a British citizen born in the UK
       and that living in Iran would take the child outside the EU.  It  was
       necessary for this to be assessed on the basis of the  reasonableness
       of the decision which the Judge failed to do. Any such error is  not,
       however, material.

   31. Submissions were made in relation to the desire to develop the family
       life between the appellant and her daughter in the UK by enabling the
       appellant to enter the UK to live with her daughter and  her  family.
       Whilst there is a positive obligation upon a State to facilitate  the
       development of family life in the future,  if  the  test  is  one  of
       proportionality, the balancing exercise is the same as for any family
       life Article 8 claim. It is a fact sensitive assessment.

   32. The sponsor is also now back in the UK with her  family.  Contact  is
       maintained indirectly with her mother but someone must  be  providing
       for her needs showing the required  level  of  day  to  day  care  is
       available, even if it has to be paid for.

   33. It has not been  shown  that  the  required  level  of  care  is  not
       available in Iran or that it is unaffordable. An  income  of  ï¿½10,000
       per month has not been shown to be insufficient, even allowing for UK
       expenses, and capital assets worth of ï¿½200,000 in Iran are available.

   34. Article 8 does not permit a person to choose where they wish to  live
       and should not be used as  a  means  to  circumvent  the  Rules.  The
       function of this  Article  is  to  protect  an  existing  right  from
       unwarranted interference by the State.  The  family  in  the  UK  are
       clearly within the category  of  those  entitled  to  rely  upon  the
       protection provided by ECHR:

           'ARTICLE 1

           Obligation to respect Human Rights

        1. The High Contracting Parties shall  secure  to  everyone  within
           their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in Section  I
           of this Convention.'

   35. The private life of those  falling  within  Article  1  will  not  be
       interfered with. The family life within the UK based family will  not
       change. The indirect contact and visits can continue to Iran but  the
       family life that exists between the appellant and her sponsor will be
       prevented from developing further. On the evidence, however,  it  has
       not been shown the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  to
       dismiss the appeal on  this  point,  i.e.  finding  the  decision  is
       proportionate, is infected by material legal error. The appeal  fails
       on this point.

   36. As an aside and no more, at  the  hearing  there  was  discussion  in
       relation to the provision  of  the  Immigration  Rules  permitting  a
       person to seek entry for the purposes of  medical  treatment.  Whilst
       this is not a route to settlement, it may cover  an  application  for
       private surgery to replace the appellant's  knees  and  pre-operative
       counselling or work to  ensure  she  is  suitable  for  surgery.  The
       sponsor thanks an ECO for granting  three  entry  clearances  to  the
       appellant in the past who must, therefore, have  a  good  immigration
       history.

   37. Persons can enter the UK as a visitor  for  medical  treatment  -  an
       individual may receive private medical treatment provided  they  meet
       the additional eligibility requirements at V 4.14 - V 4.16:

           Additional eligibility requirements for visitors coming  to  the
           UK to receive private medical treatment


           V 4.14  If  the  applicant  is  suffering  from  a  communicable
           disease, they must have satisfied  the  medical  inspector  that
           they are not a danger to public health.

           V 4.15 The applicant must have arranged  their  private  medical
           treatment before they travel to  the  UK,  and  must  provide  a
           letter from their doctor or consultant detailing:

                (a)     the  medical  condition  requiring  consultation  or
                treatment; and

                (b)    the  estimated  costs  and  likely  duration  of  any
                treatment which must be of a finite duration; and

                (c)    where the consultation or treatment will take place.

           V 4.16 If the applicant is applying for an 11 month  visit  visa
           for the purposes of private medical treatment they must also:

                (a)    provide evidence from their medical  practitioner  in
                the UK that the proposed treatment is  likely  to  exceed  6
                months but not more than 11 months; and

                (b)    if required under paragraph A39 and Appendix T Part 1
                of these Rules, provide a valid medical  certificate  issued
                by a medical practitioner listed in Appendix  T  Part  2  of
                these Rules confirming that they  have  undergone  screening
                for active pulmonary tuberculosis and that this tuberculosis
                is not present in the applicant.

   38. The option of enabling the appellant to enter UK for knee replacement
       surgery is attractive as this  will  have  effect  of  resolving  her
       mobility issues and  at  the  same  time  assisting  with  PTSD.  The
       appellant will have to persuade an ECO that  after  any  surgery  she
       will return to Iran as she has in the past.

Decision

   39. There is no material error of law in the First-tier Tribunal  Judge's
       decision. The determination shall stand.

  Anonymity.

   40. The First-tier Tribunal did  not  make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
       45(4)(i) of the Asylum and  Immigration  Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
       2005.

       I make no such order pursuant to rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
       (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
