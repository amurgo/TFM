Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Turner of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Ms Kiss, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant was born on  19  December  1982.   He  is  a  citizen  of
    Pakistan.  He appealed  against  the  respondent's  decision  dated  15
    February 2017 to refuse him indefinite leave to remain on the basis  of
    ten years' lawful and continuous residence here.

 2. The appeal against the respondent's  refusal  was  dismissed  by  Judge
    Coaster (the judge) in a decision promulgated on 30 January 2018.   The
    grounds claimed the judge erred as follows:

 3. Ground  1  -  the  judge  failed  to  recognise  that  before  the  ILR
    application, the appellant had filed an amended tax return  voluntarily
    and had also made  payment  of  relevant  tax  liabilities.   In  those
    circumstances the judge erred in failing  to  consider  whether  322(5)
    applied given "... that all was accurate and up-to-date at the date  of
    the ILR application and more importantly at  the  date  of  the  appeal
    hearing."

 4. Ground 2 - as 322(5) is a discretionary provision the  judge  erred  in
    failing to consider whether the respondent had exercised discretion and
    the judge erred in failing to exercise the discretion in the Rules.

 5. Ground 3 - the judge's credibility findings are not sound.  Whereas she
    says at [45] that the burden of proof falls on the appellant to provide
    a plausible account, at [46] the judge says that  the  account  is  not
    credible.  Plausibility imposes a far lower threshold than credibility.
     See SM and Qadir (ETS - evidence - burden of proof)  [2016]  UKUT  229
    (IAC).

 6. Ground 4 - the judge made no findings with regard to the letter at page
    54 of the appellant's bundle which  is  important  to  the  appellant's
    innocent explanation.  See MK (duty to give  reasons)  Pakistan  [2013]
    UKUT 641 (IAC).

 7. Ground 5 - the judge made no findings  with  regard  to  the  character
    reference at pages 70 onwards in the appellant's bundle.

 8. Ground 6  -  the  judge  failed  to  engage  with  the  fact  that  the
    appellant's child was born prematurely such that he was preoccupied.

 9.  Ground  7  -  the  judge  erred  in  failing  to  undertake  a  proper
    proportionality assessment.

10. Judge Pooler refused permission to appeal on 5 April 2018.  He said:

         "3.  The judge undertook  a  careful  evaluation  of  the  evidence
             relating to an underpayment of  tax  by  the  appellant.   She
             found that the appellant had been dishonest and  that  he  had
             not been the victim of a  mistake  by  his  accountant.   This
             finding was open to her and was adequately reasoned.   It  was
             moreover relevant to the issues of whether the  appellant  met
             the requirements of para 276B of  the  Immigration  Rules  and
             whether para 322(5) was  engaged.   Ground  3  refers  to  the
             burden on the appellant to advance a plausible explanation but
             under para 276B the burden of proof remained throughout on the
             appellant;  the  judge  clearly  found  the  decision  to   be
             justified under para 276B as  well  as  para  322(5)  and  any
             alleged errors of law in relation to the latter,  as  advanced
             in grounds 1 - 4, cannot be arguably material errors of law.

         4.   As to grounds 5 and 6, there was  no  duty  on  the  judge  to
             mention each and every piece of evidence in her  decision  and
             reasons.  The judge was entitled to reach her findings  having
             heard the appellant under cross-examination.

         5.   Ground 7  is  vague  and  unparticularised  and  discloses  no
             arguable error of law.

11. The  grounds  were  repeated.   Judge  Pitt  on  9  July  2018  granted
    permission to appeal, inter alia as follows:

         "3.  The decision turned on the application of paragraph 322(5)  of
             the Immigration Rules where the appellant amended a tax return
             from 2011 prior to applying for ILR in 2016. In light  of  the
             respondent's public statements on the potential misapplication
             of paragraph 322(5) and in light  of  the  grounds  concerning
             whether the correct approach was taken to the letter from  the
             most  recent  accountants  and  the  premature  birth  of  the
             appellant's child at the time he discovered the incorrect  tax
             return, it is arguable that legal error arises.

         4.   All grounds are arguable."

12. I adjourned this case when it was first before me on 7  September  2018
    with a direction as follows:

         "Not less than ten working days prior to the  resumed  hearing,  Mr
         Turner do file and serve  respondent's  public  statements  on  the
         potential  misapplication  of  paragraph  322(5)  and  a   skeleton
         argument addressing such public statements and their  applicability
         to the appellant's grounds that an incorrect approach was taken  to
         the letter from the appellant's most  recent  accountants  and  the
         interaction of the premature birth of the appellant's child at  the
         time he discovered the incorrect tax return."

13. Mr Turner filed and served  a  skeleton  dated  10  October  2018.   My
    attention was drawn  to  a  letter  from  the  Minister  of  State  for
    Immigration to Yvette Cooper MP dated 21 June 2018, a question put  to
    the Minister of State for Immigration answered on  13 June  2018.   Mr
    Turner also handed up a letter dated 14 August  2018  from  E  Smith  &
    Company, the appellant's previous accountants, said to acknowledge  and
    clarify errors  made  by  the  accountants  for  the  tax  returns  for
    2010/2011.  This letter is postdecision and I  have  not  read  it  nor
    taken it into account.

14. Mr Turner submits that the Secretary of State recognises that there are
    problems with the way rectification of tax returns are  dealt  with  in
    terms of refusal to grant indefinite leave to  remain  under  paragraph
    322(5).  This is the comment made by Upper Tribunal Judge Pitt which  I
    have referred to at [11] above.

15. Given Mr Turner's reliance on such documentation, I propose to  set  it
    out in full.  The answer given by the Minister of State for Immigration
    on 13 June 2018 was in response to a  question  made  on  6  June  2018
    asking her for what reason rectifying a tax  return  error  constituted
    sufficient grounds to refuse indefinite leave to remain under paragraph
    322(5).  The Minister for Immigration's response was as follows:

         "It is not the Government's policy to refuse  applications  due  to
         rectification of tax return errors.

         We  have  refused  applications   where   there   are   substantial
         differences - often tens of  thousands  of  pounds  -  between  the
         earnings used to claim points in an immigration application and  an
         applicant's HMRC records, without a credible explanation  from  the
         applicant.  We take all  available  evidence  into  account  before
         making a decision.  Paragraph 322(5) is  used  where  the  evidence
         shows that an applicant's character and conduct is such that  their
         application should be refused.  Any such case is signed  off  by  a
         manager before refusal grounds are applied.

         As I advised the Home Affairs Select Committee on  8  May,  we  are
         carrying out a review of these cases to see how many  showed  clear
         evidence of deceit, and whether any were minor errors."

16. The letter from the Minister of State for Immigration to Yvette  Cooper
    MP on 21 June 2018 was by way  of  updating  the  Home  Affairs  Select
    Committee on the review of the cases refused on character  and  conduct
    grounds under paragraph 322(5).

17. The letter inter alia reported the following:

           . "In 249 of the initial 281 cases reviewed, applicants  amended
             their HMRC records by more  than  �10,000.   In  many  of  the
             remaining  cases,  though  the  differences  were  less   than
             �10,000, they were nevertheless substantial.

           . In 241 cases, the amendments were made more than  three  years
             after the  initial  submission  to  HMRC,  with  the  majority
             looking to amend their records within one  year  of  making  a
             further application to the Home Office.

           . Applicants were given the choice to explain  their  situation.
             Most of those who did provided no further  explanation,  other
             than that there were errors by their accountants.

           .  Applications  were  not  refused  on  the  grounds  that  the
             applicants made  errors  in  their  tax  returns.   They  were
             refused on the grounds that the applicants had,  most  likely,
             exaggerated their earnings to the Home Office to claim  enough
             points to obtain leave to remain or indefinite leave to remain
             in the  UK  or,  alternatively,  substantially  under-reported
             their earnings to HMRC to  evade  tax.   In  either  scenario,
             their character and conduct is such  that  their  applications
             should not be granted."

18. The letter goes on to say that it is important that any applicants  who
    might have made minor errors should not be inadvertently caught  up  in
    tackling the wider pattern of abuse.

19. The appellant's circumstances can be readily distinguished  from  those
    mentioned in the respondent's public statements  who  might  have  made
    minor errors. The judge carried out what Judge Pooler called (see  [10]
    above) "... ... a careful evaluation of the  evidence  relating  to  an
    underpayment of tax by the appellant."  She set out her conclusions  at
    [32-[46].  The judge found and Ms Kiss submitted that the appellant had
    amended  the  tax  in  question  by  �21,000.   The  appellant  is   an
    intelligent, educated man; he would have known a dishonest  return  had
    been submitted on his behalf.

20. The judge found that the appellant signed off the  financial  statement
    in 2011 approving the  figures  and  acknowledging  responsibility  for
    them. The respondent's  public  statements  confirm  that  the  correct
    approach was taken with regard to the amended tax return and  no  error
    of law is established in that regard.

21. I find that none of the grounds are made out. The judge found there was
    no credible innocent  explanation  and  that  the  appellant  had  been
    dishonest. That was a finding the judge was entitled to come to on  the
    evidence. The appellant's preoccupation with the premature birth of his
    child was irrelevant to the dishonesty but in any event, there  was  no
    error of  law  in  the  judge  failing  to  mention  all  evidence  and
    submissions tendered. She  carried  out  a  careful  and  comprehensive
    analysis of all significant issues and evidence.

Decision

The grounds fail to establish any error of law.  The judge did  not  err  in
her decision which shall stand.

No anonymity direction is made.
