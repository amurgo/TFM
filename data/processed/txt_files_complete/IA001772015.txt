Representation:

For the Appellant:           Mr A Chohan (Immigration Chambers)
For the Respondent:        Ms S Sreeraman (Home Office Presenting Officer)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of Zahid Mehmood Bangash, a  citizen  of  Pakistan
       born 29  November  1974,  against  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
       tribunal of 17 July 2015 dismissing his appeal against the refusal of
       his application for leave to  remain  on  8  December  2014  and  the
       setting of removal directions against him under  section  47  of  the
       Immigration Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.


    2. He was granted leave to enter on 31 July 2010 as a student  until  30
       August 2011, which was extended until 29 April 2012, and he was  then
       given further leave as a post study worker until 4 September 2014.


    3.  His  application  of  10  July  2014  for  leave  to  remain  as  an
       Entrepreneur (to run his marketing consultancy, Szur Associates  Ltd)
       was refused primarily because of the delay in transferring  funds  to
       the United Kingdom notwithstanding that the company had been  trading
       since 7 April 2014, which  led  to  doubts  as  to  the  funds  being
       generally available to him. Furthermore  at  interview  he  had  been
       asked about market research and stated that he  had  been  conducting
       market research  in  relation  to  statistics  from  the  Office  for
       National Statistics and it was "not clear how this  relates  to  your
       business". Additionally he had not used his post study work leave  to
       develop the business, his company having been incorporated only on  7
       April 2014. The interview noted that he "had to be pushed to  explain
       what invested on. Claims to have spent on renovation  of  office  but
       wouldn't that fall to the  landlord  to  pay  for  ...  supplementary
       question  responses  also  rather  vague.  Overall  not  a   credible
       entrepreneur."


    4. At the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal he  confirmed  that  he
       had secured one contract, with Abs.com IT  solutions,  owned  by  his
       brother's friend, for which he had been paid �855.


    5. The First-tier Tribunal upheld the refusal by the Secretary of State,
       taking the view that


         a) Whilst the funds did not have to be present in the United
            Kingdom their continued retention abroad did raise an issue as
            to whether he genuinely intended to invest them here;
         b) The expenses of �10,000-�15,000 to which the Appellant referred
            at the hearing  were very significant for a small enterprise
            that was involved in leafleting and used Gumtree in contacting
            clients and it was surprising that he was unable to identify
            and explain the costs given his  expertise in business
            management; he could be expected to have considered the return
            on his investment having attracted only one client, a friend of
            his brother, who had paid him �855, through those efforts;
         c) His claim that he had additionally mentioned advertising via
            Google at interview was not a credible one given it was not
            recorded in the transcript thereof.


    6. Grounds of appeal against that decision asserted that


         1) The First-tier Tribunal had erred in law in failing to consider
            the Appellant's evidence seeking to explain the discrepancies
            believed to have arisen at interview which represented an
            illegitimate restriction on post-decision evidence: Ahmed was
            wrongly decided if it sought to rule out responses to the Home
            Office interview;
         2) The Appellant had altered his intention following his studies,
            as authorised by the Rules permitting switching into the Tier 1
            Entrepreneur route, which was relevant to the assessment of the
            compatibility of the immigration decision with his right to
            private life; furthermore the assessment under the Rules had
            infiltrated the consideration outside of them without regard to
            the admissibility of post-decision evidence on non-Points Based
            System grounds.


    7. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge Zucker for  the  First-tier
       Tribunal on 12 February 2016 on the basis that there may have been an
       error of law in the refusal to admit  evidence  going  to  non-Points
       Based System facts.


    8. At the hearing before me Mr Chohan argued that the Respondent  should
       have sought further information from the  Appellant  before  refusing
       his application if there were any matters as  to  which  she  was  in
       doubt. Given the absence of any absolute requirement to invest  funds
       in the United Kingdom before an application was  determined,  it  was
       wrong to have attributed weight to that consideration.  Ms  Sreeraman
       maintained that the decision was a lawful one.


Findings and reasons

    9. The Immigration Rules relevant to this application are  found  within
       Part 6A of the Rules addressing the Points Based System.


         "245DD. Requirements for leave to remain
         To qualify for leave to remain as a Tier 1  (Entrepreneur)  Migrant
         under this rule, an applicant must  meet  the  requirements  listed
         below. If the applicant meets these requirements, leave  to  remain
         will be granted. If the applicant does not meet these requirements,
         the application will be refused.
         Requirements: ...
         (h) Except where the applicant has, or was last granted, leave as a
         Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant, a Businessperson or an Innovator and
         is being assessed under Table 5 of Appendix  A,  the  Secretary  of
         State must be satisfied that:
         (i) the applicant genuinely:
         (1) intends and is  able  to  establish,  take  over  or  become  a
         director of one or more businesses in the UK within  the  next  six
         months, or
         (2) has established, taken over or become a director of one or more
         businesses in the UK and continues  to  operate  that  business  or
         businesses; and
         (ii) the applicant genuinely intends to invest the  money  referred
         to in Table 4 of Appendix A in the business or businesses  referred
         to in (i);
         (iii) that the money referred to  in  Table  4  of  Appendix  A  is
         genuinely available to the applicant, and will remain available  to
         him until such time as it is spent by his business  or  businesses.
         'Available to him' means that the funds are:
         (1) in his own possession,
         (2) in the financial accounts of  a  UK  incorporated  business  of
         which he is the director, or
         (3) available  from  the  third  party  or  parties  named  in  the
         application under the terms of the declaration(s)  referred  to  in
         paragraph 41-SD(b) of Appendix A;
         (iv) that the applicant does not intend to take employment  in  the
         United Kingdom other than under the terms of paragraph 245DE.
         (i) In making the assessment in (h), the Secretary  of  State  will
         assess the balance of probabilities. The  Secretary  of  State  may
         take into account the following factors:
         (i) the evidence the applicant has submitted;
         (ii) the viability and credibility  of  the  source  of  the  money
         referred to in Table 4 of Appendix A;
         (iii) the viability and credibility  of  the  applicant's  business
         plans and market research into their chosen business sector;
         (iv) the applicant's previous educational and  business  experience
         (or lack thereof);  ...
           (j)  The  Secretary  of  State  reserves  the  right  to  request
         additional information and evidence to support  the  assessment  in
         (h), and to refuse the application if the information  or  evidence
         is not provided. Any requested documents must be  received  by  the
         Secretary of State at the address specified in the  request  within
         28 working days of the date of the request. ..."


   10. In Ahmed and Another (PBS: admissible evidence) [2014] UKUT 365 (IAC)
       the Upper Tribunal ruled that where a provision of the Rules (such as
       that in para 245DD(k)) provides that points will not  be  awarded  if
       the decision-maker  is  not  satisfied  as  to  another  (non-points-
       scoring) aspect of the Rule, the non-points-scoring  aspect  and  the
       requirement for points are inextricably  linked;  as  a  result,  the
       prohibition  on  new  evidence  in  s  85A(4)  of  the   Nationality,
       Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  applies  to  the  non-points-scoring
       aspect of the rule: the prohibition is in relation  to  new  evidence
       that goes to the scoring of points.


   11. The grounds of appeal are lengthy, convoluted and very  difficult  to
       interpret as raising material errors of law.  It is  clear  that  the
       Article 8 ground has no mileage if the decision under  the  Rules  is
       upheld, because that finding would imply that  any  private  life  in
       this country had been formulated in relation to  business  activities
       that were not genuine, and it could  hardly  be  disproportionate  to
       interfere with private life of that nature. As to  the  ground  under
       the Immigration Rules, there are repeated  suggestions  therein  that
       the appeal would be used as a vehicle to question the correctness  of
       the decision in Ahmed but Mr  Chohan  did  not  press  that  line  of
       attack,  understandably  given  that  the   reasoning   therein   was
       effectively upheld in Olatunde [2015] EWCA Civ 670.


   12. I was not referred to any evidence that was overlooked by the  First-
       tier Tribunal that was admissible in its enquiry (a letter  from  the
       Appellant's brother was not part of  the  application  and  for  that
       reason was not admissible). Essentially its reasoning  was  based  on
       the fact that the business's expenses  appeared  disproportionate  to
       its returns and that the answers given at interview were unduly vague
       regarding the marketing steps taken, bearing  in  mind  the  business
       acumen of the Appellant and the  limited  range  of  activities  that
       there were for him to recall.


   13. One could certainly see that the judge below might have found in  the
       Appellant's favour. However, the question on appeal is  whether  some
       error of law infects the decision making of the First-tier  Tribunal,
       not simply whether another decision might have been taken. Before  me
       no  irrationality  or  failure  to  take  matters  into  account  was
       identified in those findings. They do not seem to me to be beyond the
       legitimate range of responses that might be taken to  such  evidence:
       whilst there is no requirement to invest all  the  funds  potentially
       available at the outset of a business enterprise, it will  be  easier
       to establish that the undertaking is a viable one if one does so; and
       although not every entrepreneur will be able to  recall  chapter  and
       verse of their stated marketing activities, it cannot  be  said  that
       vague answers must nevertheless be accepted as satisfactory.


          Decision:

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not contain  any  material
    error of law and stands. The appeal is dismissed.
