Representation:
For the Appellants:    Miss Jacob, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. These are appeals by the above Appellants who are citizens of Pakistan.
     The First and Second Appellants are  husband  and  wife  born  on  7th
    September 1965 and 18th September 1970  respectively.   The  Third  and
    Fourth Appellants are their children born on 25th July  1999  and  16th
    August 2005 respectively.  They appeal  against  the  decision  of  the
    Respondent to refuse the application of the First Appellant  for  leave
    to remain in the United Kingdom as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant  and
    the corresponding applications of the other three Appellants for  leave
    to remain as his dependents.

 2. The First Appellant first came to the UK on 10th  October  2003  having
    been granted entry clearance as a  student  valid  until  31st  October
    2004.  On 31st March 2011 he was granted leave  to  remain  until  31st
    March 2013 as a Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) Migrant.  The Second and Third
    Appellants came to the UK in 2004 and the  Fourth  Appellant  was  born
    here.  The application for leave to remain as an entrepreneur was  made
    on 27th March 2013.

 3. The Appellants' appeals against the decision of the Secretary of  State
    were heard on 26th February 2014 by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Blandy.
    He allowed the appeals on human rights grounds  having  dismissed  them
    under the Immigration Rules.  Permission was granted to appeal  against
    the decision of  Judge  Blandy  and  on  8th May  2014,  having  heard
    submissions, I found that there was a material  error  of  law  in  the
    determination of Judge Blandy insofar  as  it  related  to  the  First,
    Second and Fourth Appellants and set aside the determination insofar as
    it related to those Appellants.

 4. Both the Respondent and  the  Appellant  had  sought  leave  to  appeal
    against the determination of the First-tier Tribunal.  The  application
    by the Respondent was received first.  The  Judge  who  dealt  with  it
    said:

         "2.  It is not arguable that there is a material error  of  law  in
             relation to the  Third  Appellant  as  Judge  Blandy  made  it
             sufficiently clear at paragraph 21 that her appeal  was  being
             allowed under the Rules as she was under 18 and  had  achieved
             ten years' residence in the UK.

           3. It is arguable that in relation to the other Appellants  Judge
             Blandy was not sufficiently clear as to  the  legal  basis  on
             which he was allowing their  appeals  under  Article  8  human
             rights given his clear findings that they  could  not  succeed
             under the Rules.  There is an arguable material error  of  law
             in the decisions relating to  the  First,  Second  and  Fourth
             Appellants."

 5. A month later on 1st May 2014, Upper Tribunal Judge Martin  dealt  with
    the application for leave submitted late by the Appellants.  She  said:



         "2.  The applications are out of  time.   The  applications  should
             have been received by 17th March and were not in fact received
             until 30th April 2014.  The reason the applications are  late,
             it   is   contended,   is   that   the   Appellants    changed
             representatives.

           3. However it is clear that what has prompted the applications is
             the  fact  that  the  Secretary  of  State  has  been  granted
             permission to appeal in relation to Appellants  1,  2  and  4.
             The proper procedure in that event is for  the  Appellants  to
             file a Response pursuant to Rule 24 of the Tribunal  Procedure
             (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 in which they can (a) defend their
             determination and (b) argue  that  the  Judge  ought  to  have
             allowed the appeal on another basis.  Rule 24(3)(e).

           4. I therefore do not admit the application but direct  that  the
             application be treated as a Rule 24 notice."

 6. In considering whether there was an error of law I took the  view  that
    in granting leave to the Third Appellant  Judge  Blandy  had  taken  no
    account of the fact that paragraph 276ADE is a discretionary  provision
    or of the fact that it requires it to be shown to be  unreasonable  for
    the child to have to leave the UK and that he  erred  in  allowing  the
    appeals of the other three Appellants on the  basis  of  the  grant  of
    leave to the third Appellant.

 7.  At the first hearing before me Mr Khan for  the  Appellants  submitted
    that the First Appellant would qualify for leave to remain  in  the  UK
    under paragraph 276B of the Immigration Rules because he  had  by  that
    time resided here lawfully for ten years.  He  further  submitted  that
    the Fourth Appellant also meets the requirements  of  paragraph  276ADE
    having been here for more than seven years.  Neither  of  these  issues
    had been previously raised.

Evidence at the hearing

 8. I have two statements from the First Appellant, the  first  dated  14th
    February 2014 and the second 15th July 2014.

 9. The First Appellant confirms that he arrived in the UK on 10th  October
    2003 with valid leave  as  a  student.   The  bulk  of  this  statement
    pertains  to  the  refusal  of  the  application  for   leave   as   an
    entrepreneur.  Permission was not granted in relation to the refusal of
    the application under the Immigration Rules.  The Appellant goes on  to
    say that his daughter arrived in the UK on 27th June 2004 and has  been
    at school in the UK since then.  His second child was born here in 2005
    and is also at school here.

10. In his second statement he says that he has been  in  the  UK  lawfully
    studying and working for nearly eleven years.  He  has  not  left  here
    since 2004 and is currently working as a Management Consultant with his
    own management consultancy business.  With regard to his  son  he  says
    his whole life is in the UK and he has no ties to Pakistan.  His  first
    language is English.   He does speak some Urdu but is  not  fluent  and
    cannot read or write in that language.   I  have  statements  from  the
    First Appellant's wife confirming the family circumstances as  set  out
    above.

11. In cross-examination Mr Melvin put it to the First  Appellant  that  he
    had reported his passport missing in May 2006 and then obtained a fresh
    one from the Pakistan Embassy.  He asked  the  First  Appellant  if  he
    could remember the start and expiry dates on that passport it  and  the
    Appellant said he could not.  Mr Melvin  put  it  to  him  that  it  is
    therefore difficult to determine his movements from the  time  he  came
    here to the time he got his new passport.  He asked him if there is any
    evidence that he was in the UK between 2003 and  2006.   The  Appellant
    insisted that he was in the UK.  He asked him about his work in the  UK
    between 2011 and 2013 and the Appellant gave details of this.  He  gave
    some details of his business.  His wife works  for  him  part-time  and
    gets a salary of �600 a month which he pays into her bank account.

12. In re-examination the Appellant confirmed that he had gone to  Pakistan
    on 7th April 2004 and returned to the UK after 37  days.   He  went  to
    collect his wife and daughter and bring them to the UK and had not left
    the UK since then.

13. The Second Appellant gave evidence adopting her statements.  In  cross-
    examination she told Mr Melvin that she had last  visited  Pakistan  in
    2008 and had not been back since.  She confirmed that she  does  twenty
    hours a week in her husband's business and gets paid �600 a month.  She
    has a contract that says she does twenty  hours  a  week.   The  Inland
    Revenue are aware of this job.  The family are not in receipt of  state
    benefits.  There is enough money in the business to support the family.
     Her husband also works as a taxi driver.   She confirmed that  it  had
    been her husband's intention, as he told  the  Immigration  Officer  on
    entry, to start a school in Islamabad but the children settled here and
    they had their baby here and then did not want to return  to  Pakistan.
    Initially they did intend to return and it was only three or four years
    ago that they changed their minds.

My findings

14. I have given careful consideration to all the evidence put before me in
    this case.

15. It submitted that the Appellant's case should succeed  under  paragraph
    276B of the Immigration Rules.

16. Paragraph 276B  says,

    276B. The requirements to be met by an applicant for indefinite leave
    to remain on the ground of long residence in the United Kingdom are
    that:
         (i)  he has had at least 10 years continuous lawful residence in
    the United Kingdom.
         (ii) having regard to the public interest there are no reasons why
         it would be undesirable for him to be given indefinite leave to
         remain on the ground of long residence, taking into account his:
             (a) age; and
             (b) strength of connections in the United Kingdom; and
             (c) personal history, including character, conduct,
             associations and employment record; and
             (d) domestic circumstances; and
             (e) compassionate circumstances; and
             (f) any representations received on the person's behalf; and
         (iii) the applicant does not fall for refusal under the general
         grounds for refusal.
         (iv) the applicant has demonstrated sufficient knowledge of the
         English language and sufficient knowledge about life in the United
         Kingdom, in accordance with Appendix KoLL.
         (v) the applicant must not be in the UK in breach of immigration
         laws except that any period of overstaying for a period of 28 days
         or less will be disregarded, as will any period of overstaying
         between periods of entry clearance, leave to enter or leave to
         remain of up to 28 days and any period of overstaying pending the
         determination of an application made within that 28 day period.

17. The Appellant came to the  UK  in  October  2003.  The  Respondent  has
    provided no evidence that he was out of the UK for longer than  the  37
    days stated. No  records  are  kept  of  people  exiting  the  UK.  The
    Appellant has never been in receipt of  public  funds  and  has  always
    worked to support his family.  His  wife  is  working  too.   There  is
    nothing before me to suggest any reason why it would be contrary to the
    public interest to allow him  and  his  family  to  remain  here.   His
    firstborn child came to the UK in 2004 when she was around 5 years  old
    and his younger child was born here in 2005.  The  children  have  been
    brought up here. Neither has any knowledge or  experience  of  life  in
    Pakistan.  Both  are  settled  here.  Both  meet  the  requirements  of
    paragraph  276ADE (iv) that they have resided in the  UK  for  7  years
    subject to the requirement that it be unreasonable to  expect  them  to
    leave the UK. Taking into account all the circumstances  including  the
    fact that their parents have been here lawfully for over 10  years  and
    indeed that a Judge has already granted leave to the  older  child  and
    this finding was not challenged, I find that it would  be  unreasonable
    to expect them to leave the UK. In any  event  they  are  dependant  on
    their father who I find is entitled to Indefinite Leave  to  Remain  in
    the UK on the grounds of long residence here.

Notice of Decision

The appeal is allowed under the Immigration Rules.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make no  fee  award
as the basis on which the appeal has been allowed was not before the  First-
tier Tribunal and was only very recently open to the Appellants  and  raised
by them.
