                      ERROR OF LAW FINDING AND REASONS


      1. The appellant appeals with  permission  a  decision  of  First-tier
         Tribunal Judge Cox who in a determination promulgated on 23  August
         2018 dismissed the appellant's appeal on human rights grounds.







Background



      2. The appellant is a citizen of Afghanistan born on 11 November  1998
         who, on 13 April 2017, applied for a Visa to enable her to join her
         husband, her sponsor, in the United Kingdom. Having considered  the
         evidence the Judge sets out findings  of  fact  from  [15]  of  the
         decision under challenge.
      3. The Judge found in the appellant's favour in relation to one aspect
         of concern to the Entry Clearance Officer (ECO) where  at  [26]  it
         was found the Judge was satisfied the appellant and sponsor are  in
         a genuine and subsisting relationship and that there  is  potential
         family life between them that ought to be respected.
      4. The issue of concern related to the availability of funds available
         to this family unit. The Judge sets out relevant  findings  between
         [32 - 37] in the following terms:

             "32.     Under E-ECP.3.1, the Appellant must provide specified
                  evidence, from the sources listed in paragraph  E-ECP.3.2,
                  of a specified gross annual income  of  at  least  �18,600
                  (the Minimum Income Threshold, MIT). Under the rules,  and
                  Appellant is required to provide the specified evidence of
                  the claimed income for 6 month period preceding  the  date
                  of application.


             33.  The Appellant claimed that the Sponsor earned �15,935 per
                  year as a Barista with  Task  Master  Resources  Ltd.  The
                  Sponsor accepts that this was not sufficient to  meet  the
                  MIT and sought to rely on additional  earnings  of  �2,796
                  from his part-time  employment  with  Patisserie  Holdings
                  Ltd.


             34.   The  ECO  noted  that  the  Sponsor  was  employed  with
                  Patisserie Holdings Ltd from 23/3/2015 to  20/8/2016.  The
                  ECO stated it was unclear at  what  point  the  additional
                  �2,796 was  earned  or  whether  this  was  the  Sponsor's
                  cumulative earnings from his time at Patisserie Ltd.


             35.  Attached to the grounds of appeal, there is a letter from
                  HMRC, dated 23 June 2017. The letter sets out the Sponsors
                  earnings  from  Patisserie  Ltd  and  shows  that  between
                  23/03/2015 and 28/8/2016  he  earned  �2,554  and  between
                  5/11/2016 and 2/12/2016 he earned a further �241. However,
                  this does not assist the Appellant, as  it  suggests  that
                  for the relevant 6 month period he only earned �241, which
                  would not be sufficient to meet the shortfall in the MIT.


             36.  The Sponsor has now provided his annual tax  summary  for
                  the year 2016 - 17, which showed that he earned �18,626.41
                  during that year. However, the Sponsor  has  not  provided
                  his  payslips  for  Patisserie  Ltd,  which   would   have
                  demonstrated the months he earned the additional income.


             37.  Overall, the Appellant has failed to demonstrate that she
                  provided   all   the   specified   documents   and,   more
                  importantly, that the Sponsors  earnings  with  Patisserie
                  Ltd for the 6 months preceding  the  application  met  the
                  shortfall  in  the  sponsors  earnings   from   his   main
                  employment. On the totality of the evidence, I  find  that
                  the  Appellant  does  not   meet   financial   eligibility
                  requirements of Appendix FM."

      5. Thereafter the Judge went on to consider the merits of  the  appeal
         by reference article 8, considering section 117 of the 2002 Act, in
         relation to which the financial issues were further  considered  at
         [43] in the following terms:

             "43.     The Sponsor provided his tax  summary  for  the  year
                  2016/17, which is  the  tax  year  covering  the  relevant
                  period. The summary showed that his income  for  the  year
                  was �18,626.41 which is above the MIT. However,  as  noted
                  above the document does not show, what  he  earned  during
                  the 6 months preceding the application. In my view,  there
                  are  good  policy  reasons  why  the  Secretary  of  State
                  requires an applicant to demonstrate a  sufficient  income
                  for the 6 months immediately  preceding  the  application.
                  For example, he would want to be satisfied that a  sponsor
                  is   still   earning   a   sufficient   income.   In   the
                  circumstances, I have attached limited weight to the  fact
                  that the Sponsor earned more than  the  MIT  in  the  year
                  preceding the application."

      6. The appellant sought permission to  appeal  which  was  granted  by
         another judge of the First-Tier Tribunal on 18  October  2018;  the
         relevant part of the grant being in the following terms:

             "2.  The grounds state  that  the  First-Tier  Tribunal  Judge
                  erred in his assessment  of  the  evidence  regarding  the
                  financial requirements. The grounds state that the  First-
                  Tier Tribunal Judge misunderstood the evidence before him.
                  The grounds state that the letter from HMRC did not  state
                  that the sponsor earned �2,795 from Patisserie Ltd from 23
                  March 2015  until  20  August  2016  but  rather  that  he
                  commenced  employment  on  23  March   2016   and   ceased
                  employment on 20 August 2016 and  that  in  the  tax  year
                  April 2016 - April 2017, he  earned  �2,795.  The  grounds
                  further assert that the First-Tier Tribunal Judge erred in
                  finding that the appellant did not  supply  the  specified
                  evidence with the application.


             3.   At Paragraph 35 of the decision, the First-Tier  Tribunal
                  Judge refers to the letter from HMRC and states that  this
                  showed the sponsors earning from Patisserie Ltd between 23
                  March 2015 and 20 August 2016. In fact, the letter states,
                  'For the tax year  2016  to  2017  my  records  show'  and
                  'sources of income for the tax year ending 5 April  2017'.
                  It is arguable therefore that the  letter  from  HMRC  has
                  been misconstrued and that it  related  to  the  tax  year
                  2016/2017 and not to income  received  between  the  start
                  date and the end date of the  employment.  The  First-Tier
                  Tribunal Judge also  noted  that  the  appellant  had  not
                  provided payslips for his employment  at  Patisserie  Ltd.
                  The appellant states that these  were  provided  with  the
                  application. However, the  respondent's  bundle  does  not
                  include  them  and  they  were  not  re-submitted  by  the
                  appellant  (if  they  were   ever   submitted   with   the
                  application).  Nonetheless,  it  is  arguable   that   the
                  misconception regarding the information  provided  in  the
                  HMRC letter may have an impact on the First-Tier  Tribunal
                  Judges subsequent proportionality assessment including his
                  assessment of whether there was cogent  evidence  to  show
                  that the appellant met the financial requirements even  if
                  it was not the specified evidence."


Error of law



      7. For the purpose of  the  hearing  before  the  Upper  Tribunal  the
         appellant has provided a  substantial  bundle  of  documents  which
         includes the HMRC letter,  various  photographs,  bank  statements,
         copy wage slips and copies of  communications  that  have  occurred
         between the appellant and the sponsor.
      8. It was accepted by Mr Diwnycz that the appellant had made  out  his
         case  that  the  Judge  has  made  a  material  error  of  law   by
         misunderstanding the information recorded on the HMRC letter in the
         grounds.
      9. The decision of the Judge is set aside. The findings in relation to
         the appellant  and  sponsor  being  in  a  genuine  and  subsisting
         relationship are preserved findings as are those  relating  to  the
         sources of the sponsors income from employment.
     10. It was accepted by all parties that the Judge was right to find the
         appellant could not satisfy the  requirements  of  the  Immigration
         Rules as it was not shown that the appellant provided proof of  the
         income in the form of the documents specified in Appendix FM  -  SE
         for the relevant period.
     11. It  was  accepted,  however  that  the  evidence  provided  clearly
         demonstrated that the sponsor was earning more than the MIT. It was
         accepted that in light of the fact the two issues  relied  upon  by
         the ECO, relationship and level of funding, had been decided in the
         appellant's  favour   that   the   refusal   will   amount   to   a
         disproportionate interference with the right to family life of  the
         appellant and sponsor - section 117 of the 2002 Act considered.
     12. Article 8 ECHR has no requirement for  evidence  to  be  proved  in
         accordance with Appendix FM - SE. The material provided establishes
         on the balance  of  probabilities  that  the  appellant  does,  the
         assistance of a sponsor, satisfy the income requirement.


Decision


     13. The First-tier Tribunal Judge materially erred in law. I set  aside
         the decision of the  original  Judge.  I  remake  the  decision  as
         follows. This appeal is allowed pursuant to Article 8 ECHR.


   Anonymity.


     14. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
         45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
         2005.


         I make no such order pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal  Procedure
         (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
