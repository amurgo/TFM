Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Roberto Prieto (family member)
For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

These are the approved record of the decision and reasons which I gave
orally at the end of the hearing on 23rd April 2021.

This is the remaking of the decision in the appellant's appeal against the
respondent's refusal of her application for a residence permit as the
dependent child of the spouse of an EEA (Spanish) national, Mr Roberto
Prieto.  It is now accepted that the appellant is the daughter of Mr
Prieto's wife, Ms Wilson.  The only issue is whether the appellant is
dependent on Mr Prieto.

The appellant, a citizen of Nigeria, born on 1st June 1997, applied for a
family permit to accompany her stepfather, Mr Prieto, a Spanish national
who, prior to Brexit, was exercising Treaty rights, to the UK.  The date of
her application is not apparent from the papers, but at the time of her
application she was studying in Spain and, she asserts, was in possession
of an EEA Residence Card.  It is not suggested that she was a minor at the
date of her application.

In her decision dated 25th July 2019, the respondent refused the
application on a number of grounds (not now all pursued), including not
accepting the relationships between the appellant and Ms Wilson as claimed;
and not accepting claimed dependency between the appellant and Mr Prieto.
The appellant appealed against that decision on 25th August 2019.

In a decision promulgated on 21st April 2020, First-tier Tribunal Judge
Flynn (the 'FtT') dismissed the appellant's appeal, following consideration
of the appeal on the papers only.  The FtT accepted that Mr Wilson and Mr
Prieto were married as claimed, but not that the appellant was related to
Ms Wilson; or that she was dependent on him.

The appellant appealed and the basis of her challenges are set out in the
error-of-law decision annexed to this remaking decision.

In its error-of-law decision, this Tribunal set aside the FtT's decision,
allowing the appeal, but preserving the FtT's finding that Mr Prieto and Ms
Wilson are married and the respondent's concession that the appellant is
related to Ms Wilson.  This Tribunal regarded it as appropriate to remake
the decision, noting the narrowness of the remaining contested issue.

The issue in this appeal

The sole issue remaining in dispute is whether the appellant was and
remains dependent on Mr Prieto.

The gist of the respondent's refusal

The core points taken against the appellant were the lack of money
transfers or other means of financial support, and evidence of the family's
wider circumstances which would satisfy the respondent that without the
financial support of Mr Prieto, the appellant's essential living needs
would not be met.

The Law

The test that the appellant must meet, to satisfy regulation 7(2) of the
EEA Regulations 2016, is one of dependency.  The burden of proof is on her
to prove this, to the ordinary civil standard.



The case of Reyes v Migrationsverket (Case C- 423/12) confirms that an
appellant must need a sponsor's support in order to meet their basic needs
for the purposes of financial dependency.  It is irrelevant whether the
dependency is out of choice, in circumstances where an appellant does not
already have sufficient funds of her own, as opposed to the ability to
work.

The hearing before me

I identified the sole issue of dependency and in light of Ms Everett's
comment that she was minded to concede the appeal subject to any document
that I had been able to identify that called into question the dependency,
I reviewed the witness statement of Mr Prieto dated 5th April 2021 at pages
[4] to [9] of the appellant's bundle.  Very broadly speaking, it dealt with
the various aspects of the claimed dependency including the fact that the
appellant is a full-time student; that she received regular remittances
solely from Mr Prieto and that also she lived in a flat co-owned (not by
her) by Mr Prieto, who paid for all of those home insurances, council
taxes, utilities and service contract; and for which she paid nothing.

Before me, Mr Prieto adopted his witness statement and his evidence was
unchallenged by Ms Everett.  His witness statement referred to extensive
documentation in the appellant's bundle. The documentation included, by way
of example, confirmation that the appellant was not registered for any tax
by the Spanish authorities (document [19]); that she had been attending an
education centre in Durango between 2016 and 2021 (document [12]) and a
record of almost weekly financial remittances from Mr Prieto and the
appellant (document [22]).

I asked one further supplemental question of Mr Prieto to address the
question of whether the appellant had any additional, separate, savings.
The context of my asking this question was to identify whether,
notwithstanding the provision of accommodation; the appellant's role as a
student; and remittances from Mr Prieto;  the appellant had any savings of
substance on which she could be expected to rely, rather than on Mr Prieto.
 Mr Prieto confirmed on oath that the appellant had no income and no
savings of any substance.  I accept his evidence without challenge or
reservation.

In the circumstances, I find that appellant was and is dependent upon Mr
Prieto for her basic needs.  As a consequence, the respondent's decision
dated 25th July 2019 breached the appellant's rights under the Immigration
(EEA) Regulations 2016.

Conclusions

On the facts established in this appeal, the appellant is dependent on Mr
Prieto and so meets the definition of 'family member' for the purposes of
regulation 7 of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2016.





Decision

The appellant's appeal under the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2016
succeeds. The respondent's decision is not upheld.

For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    Introduction


 1. This is an appeal against a decision, promulgated on 21 April 2020,  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Flynn ["the FtT"] dismissing the  Appellant's
    appeal against a decision of the Respondent, dated  25  July  2019,  to
    refuse her application for a  residence  card  pursuant  to  regulation
    7(2)(ii) of the Immigration (European Economic Area)  Regulations  2016
    ["the 2016 Regulations"].


 2. The basis of the Appellant's application under the 2016 Regulations  is
    that she is the step-daughter of Mr  Prieto  ["the  sponsor"],  who  is
    married to the Appellant's mother, Ms Wilson, and that she is dependent
    upon him.


 3. The FtT decided the appeal on the papers, pursuant to rule 25(1)(a)  of
    the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal)  (Immigration  and  Asylum
    Chamber) Rules 2014 ["the Tribunal Procedure Rules"]. The FtT dismissed
    the appeal, having found that the Appellant had not  demonstrated  that
    she is the daughter of Ms Wilson or that  she  is  dependent  upon  the
    sponsor. The FtT accepted that the sponsor and Ms Wilson are married.

The grounds of appeal and the grant of permission

 4. On 16 June 2020, permission was granted by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Kelly. The grant of permission was not limited but the specific  reason
    given was that it was arguable that the FtT had erred  in  taking  into
    account an irrelevant consideration in deciding that the  Appellant  is
    not the daughter of Ms Wilson, namely by drawing adverse inferences  in
    relation  to  the  Appellant's  credibility  from  the  fact  that  the
    Appellant chose to have her  appeal  before  the  FtT  decided  on  the
    papers, rather than at a hearing. We refer to this as ground 1.


 5. Next, the FtT erred in finding that there was no evidence, or none that
    was sufficiently reliable,  to  demonstrate  the  claimed  relationship
    between the  Appellant  and  Ms  Wilson  ["ground  2"]  and  dependency
    ["ground 3"].


Discussion and conclusions

Ground 1

 6. At [13] of the decision, the FtT stated:


    I find it surprising  that  the  Appellant  did  not  request  an  oral
    hearing, at which her mother and step-father could  have  appeared  and
    clarified  these  issues  [the  evidential  issues  relating   to   the
    mother/daughter relationship]. This failure  reinforces  my  conclusion
    that the relationship is not as claimed.


 7. The Tribunal Procedure Rules make provision for an appeal to be decided
    on the papers. There can be no basis for drawing an  adverse  inference
    as to credibility by reason of the Appellant making such a request.  We
    note that Mr Tufan, quite properly, conceded this error.


 8. Before drawing the adverse inference, the FtT gave two reasons why,  in
    her view, the Appellant had not demonstrated that she is  the  daughter
    of Ms Wilson. It may be that in using the word  "reinforces",  the  FtT
    had intended to convey that the adverse  inference  drawn  did  nothing
    more than accord with a decision already made on the evidence but it is
    far  from  clear.  Consequently,  we  cannot  be  satisfied  that   the
    irrelevant consideration formed no part of the decision making  and  we
    therefore conclude that it amounts to an error of law.

 9. However, we have gone on to consider whether that error  was  material,
    meaning whether irrespective of the error, the  same  conclusion  would
    inevitably have been reached by the FtT. We have concluded that  it  is
    material, particularly in light of the FtT's ignorance  of  a  relevant
    fact, which we come on to discuss in relation  to  ground  2  in  these
    reasons.

Ground 2


10. The evidence before the FtT of the familial relationship was:

    1) an 'Attestation of Birth', dated 13 November 2015, which records  Ms
       Wilson as being the mother of the Appellant and
    2) a statutory declaration of the Appellant's age, made by Ms Wilson in
       her capacity as the Appellant's mother and
    3) family registration documents issued in Spain.


11. The FtT was not satisfied that the documents were sufficiently reliable
    in themselves to demonstrate the claimed relationship because there was
    no explanation why the birth of the Appellant  was  not  registered  in
    accordance with Nigerian law,  which  provides,  as  described  in  the
    reasons for refusal of the Respondent, pursuant to Decree No. 69 of the
    Nigerian Births, Deaths, etc. (Compulsory Registration) Act of December
    1992, that all births must be registered with a period of 60 days.


12. What the FtT did not know is that, in an Entry Clearance Manager review
    decision dated 31  December  2019,  the  Respondent  had  reviewed  the
    further evidence submitted by the  Appellant  and  concluded  that  the
    relationship between Appellant and Ms  Wilson  was  accepted.  We  only
    became aware of this concession when we were provided with that further
    review by Mr Tufan at the start of the hearing. The  sponsor  indicated
    that  he  was  previously  unaware  of  the  concession.    Noting  the
    authority of   E v Secretary of State for Home Department [2004]  EWCA,
    at �66 and 91, the FtT had proceeded in ignorance of  a  relevant  fact
    (the Entry Clearance Manager review decision, the evidence for which we
    admit).  The fact of that decision is uncontentious and Mr  Tufan  does
    not seek to resile from it. The appellant was unaware of  the  decision
    until the hearing before us and so cannot be  fairly  held  responsible
    for the error. The Appellant and the Respondent clearly have  a  shared
    interest in  co-operating  to  achieve  the  correct  result;  and  the
    mistaken impression  clearly  played  a  material  part  in  the  FtT's
    reasoning, so that there was an  error  of  law,  based  on  the  FtT's
    ignorance of an established and relevant fact.

13. Her decision on this issue is therefore unsafe and cannot stand.

Ground 3


14. The FtT concluded at [20] that  there  was  no  evidence  of  financial
    dependency. Whilst we have sympathy with the FtT because the absence of
    written witness statements made the task of assessing the evidence  far
    more difficult than it need have been, there was  in  fact  documentary
    evidence of financial dependency in the papers:


    1) a legal certificate, provided to the  Spanish  authorities,  by  the
       sponsor, that he would be "responsible and obliged to cover  all  of
       the expenses that [the Appellant] may incur - thus being responsible
       for, among others, those  arising  from  her  accommodation,  living
       expenses and healthcare and education ...";
    2) documents originating from the  Spanish  authorities,  demonstrating
       that the Appellant had not registered any earned income; and
    3) written confirmation from Spanish authorities that the Appellant had
       not received any state financial assistance.

15. We conclude that the failure to take into account relevant evidence  is
    an error  of  law  and  further,  it  renders  the  FtT's  decision  on
    dependency unsafe, particularly where,  as  here,  the  Respondent  has
    accepted that the relationship between the Appellant and her mother was
    genuine, albeit that the FtT was unaware of this at the time.

Decision on error of law

16. The First-tier Tribunal's decision contains errors of law, such that it
    is unsafe and cannot stand.  We set the decision aside, while
    preserving the finding that the sponsor and Ms Wilson are married and
    noting the Respondent's concession as to the genuineness of the
    relationship between the Appellant and her mother.


Disposal

17. With reference to paragraph 7.2 of the Senior President's Practice
    Statement, given the limited scope of the issues and disputed facts, it
    is appropriate that the Upper Tribunal remakes the FtT's decision.
    Directions for the remaking are set out below.




Directions

18. The following directions shall apply to the future conduct of this
    appeal:


      a. The Resumed Hearing will be listed at Field House before any Upper
         Tribunal Judge with a time estimate of 1 � hours.
      b. The Appellant shall, no later than two weeks prior to the Hearing,
         file with the Upper Tribunal and serve upon the Respondent's
         representative a consolidated, indexed, and paginated bundle
         containing all the documentary evidence upon which she intends to
         rely.  Witness statements in the bundle must be signed, dated, and
         contain a declaration of truth and shall stand as the evidence-in-
         chief of the maker.
      c. The Respondent shall have leave to file any further documentation
         she intends to rely upon in response to the Appellant's evidence,
         provided the same is filed no later than one week prior to the
         Hearing.


Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains material errors of law  and
we set it aside, subject to the preserved finding set out above.

No anonymity direction is made
