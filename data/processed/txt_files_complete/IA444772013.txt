                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


     1. This is an appeal against a determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
        Judge D Thomas promulgated on the 27th January 2014  following  her
        consideration of the merits of the appeal on the papers.


     2. The Appellant is a Portuguese national born on  the  28th  December
        1956.  On 18th July 2013  she  applied  to  the  Respondent  for  a
        Residence Card claiming to have  been  employed  by  Jassy  Systems
        Limited since 28th October 2012 on a permanent contract of 40 hours
        per week for which she received an income of �1,500 a month.


     3. Section 6.10 of the application contained an employers  declaration
        which has an illegible signature at section 6.11 but  no  employers
        stamp in the relevant part of the form, although I accept the  same
        is only required "if available".  Wage  slips  for  the  months  of
        March-June 2013 were provided  showing  a  gross  monthly  wage  of
        �1,500.


     4. The application was refused on the 18th September 2013  as  it  was
        not accepted that on the evidence the Appellant had proved that she
        was a qualified person.  In the refusal letter of the same date the
        Appellant is  advised  that  the  Respondent  has  been  unable  to
        undertake verification checks for the following reasons:


              i.  The address provided for the company does  not  match  the
   company                 address on Duedil.com;


              ii. The company address  provided  on  the  application  form,
   cannot  be                located  as  an  address  for  "Jassy  Services
   Limited" on Google and  this                address  seems  to  be  in  a
   residential area;


              iii.     The company you claim to work for cannot  be  located
   on  yell.com,                  therefore  we  was  unable  to  call  said
   employer to verify your                       employment.


     5. In her skeleton argument prepared for the purposes  of  the  First-
        tier appeal hearing the Appellant stated that her  employer  has  a
        trading address but also  trades  from  the  home  address  of  the
        employer which is that provided in the application  form.  She  was
        unable to provide an explanation  for  why  the  business  was  not
        registered with Yell.com and maintains  that  she  is  employed  as
        required by the Regulations.  It  is  also  asserted  that  if  the
        Respondent wished to make checks she could  have  done  so  at  the
        address provided on the application form.


     6. A letter said to be from the employer has also been provided, dated
        9th December 2013, under  cover  of  a  separate  letter  from  the
        Appellant dated 10th December 2013.


     7. Having considered all the material provided the Judge stated:




          5.  In order to meet  the  requirements  and  to  prove  that  she
   qualifies  as  a  worker             under  regulation  6  of   the   EEA
   Regulations 2006,  the  Appellant  must  prove  that              she  is
   employed.  The evidence she provided is limited to a few pay  slips,  one
     bank statement and a letter from Jassy Systems Ltd.  None of the issues
   raised in           the decision have been  properly  addressed.  If  her
   employment exists as claimed,             the Appellant ought be able  to
   produce  obvious  supporting  documentation  such                as,   an
   employment contract, P60  and  tax  registration  details,  current  wage
   slips;              and evidence of her employer's company  registration,
   tax registration and                   accounts.   The  limited  evidence
   before the Tribunal  is  not  sufficient  to  discharge               the
   burden of  proof  of  employment  which  rests  with  the  Appellant.   I
   therefore           find the Appellant has  not  proved  that  she  is  a
   qualified person exercising               European Treaty Rights  in  the
   UK. The Respondent's decision is these                 circumstances,  is
   justified and in accordance with the law.



Discussion



     8. The status of a 'worker' in European law has a defined  meaning  as
        recognised in the case of Begum (EEA - worker - jobseeker) Pakistan
        [2011] UKUT 00275 (IAC)  in  which  the  Tribunal  held  that  when
        deciding whether an EEA national is a worker for  the  purposes  of
        the EEA Regulations, regard must be had to the fact that  the  term
        has a meaning in EU law, that it must be  interpreted  broadly  and
        that it is not conditioned by the type of employment or the  amount
        of income derived.  But a person who does not pursue effective  and
        genuine activities, or pursues activities on such a small scale  as
        to be regarded as purely marginal and ancillary or  which  have  no
        economic value to an employer, is not a worker.  In  this  context,
        regard must be given to the nature of the  employment  relationship
        and the rights and duties of the person concerned to decide if work
        activities are effective and genuine.


     9. In LN v Styrelsen Case C-46/12 CJEU Third Chamber it was held  that
        the concept of "worker" within the meaning of  Article  45  of  the
        TFEU expressed the requirement, which  was  inherent  in  the  very
        principle of the free movement  of  workers,  that  the  advantages
        conferred by EU law under that freedom may be  relied  on  only  by
        people  genuinely  pursuing  or  wishing   to   pursue   employment
        activities.


    10. Both cases highlight the requirement for a person claiming to  have
        the status of a worker to be  "genuinely  pursuing  or  wishing  to
        pursue employment activities".  The burden of proving that  such  a
        requirement is met rests upon the Appellant. The Judge was required
        to consider whether at  the  date  of  hearing  the  Appellant  had
        discharged such a burden upon her on the balance of probabilities.


    11. The challenge to the Judge's decision is, in effect, a challenge to
        the  weight  she  gave  to  the  evidence.    Provided  the   Judge
        considered the evidence with the degree  of  care  required  in  an
        appeal of this nature,  commonly  referred  to  as  being  that  of
        anxious scrutiny, and gave adequate reasons for the findings  made,
        then weight was a matter for the Judge.


    12.  In  this  case  the  Appellant  made  an  application  based  upon
        information which was found to be lacking for the reasons  set  out
        in the refusal letter. The  Appellant  was  therefore  aware  of  a
        number of concerns in relation to her claim.  Notwithstanding  this
        she provided the letter dated 9th December 2013, referred to above,
        but little else as evidence of her employment.


    13. At the date of the hearing the Judge only had the four  wage  slips
        for a period ending June 2013 and a bank statement for June 2013, a
        period seven months before the date of the hearing.  The  Applicant
        must have had a P60 for the tax year 2012-2013 and wage slips up to
        December 2013 by the date of the  hearing  if  her  employment  was
        genuine  and  ongoing.   Additional  bank  statements  proving  the
        receipt of income must also  have  been  available,  but  were  not
        disclosed. At the hearing  before  the  Upper  Tribunal  Mrs  Costa
        confirmed that such document were available  and  even  showed  the
        Tribunal copies of the same. They had, however, not  been  provided
        to Judge Thomas despite a clear direction having been made advising
        Mrs Costa of the need to make available her evidence no later  than
        20th December 2013. No satisfactory explanation  was  provided  for
        why this evidence was not submitted and it  is  not  an  error  for
        Judge Thomas not to consider something she was not aware of.


    14. At its highest the evidence provided  by  the  Appellant  with  her
        application indicated that she may have been employed between March
        to June 2013 not that she remained employed  at  the  date  of  the
        hearing or was engaged with the job market. The  letter  dated  9th
        January 2013  is  not  determinative  of  the  Appellant's  ongoing
        employment in light of the issues referred to by the Judge and,  on
        the basis of the limited information provided, it  cannot  be  said
        that the conclusions reached are perverse or irrational. The  Judge
        put the weight she was entitled to give to the evidence and  found,
        having also considered the reasons set out in the  refusal  notice,
        that the Appellant had not discharged the burden of proof upon  her
        to the required standard to prove she was entitled to  a  Residence
        Card as recognition of her status as a worker.


    15. The Appellant was advised in court that if she has further relevant
        evidence she can  always  make  a  fresh  application  although  Mr
        Whitwell indicated that such an application has already been  made-
        in April 2014.


Decision

    16. There is no material  error  of  law  in  the  Immigration  Judge's
        decision. The determination shall stand.


Anonymity.


    17. The First-tier Tribunal made no order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i)  of
        the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.  I make
        no such order pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper
        Tribunal) Rules 2008) as there  is  no  application  for  anonymity
        which is not justified on the facts.
