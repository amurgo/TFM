                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     Mr S Winter, Advocate, instructed by Katani & Co,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The respondent refused the appellant's claim for reasons  explained  in
    her letter dated 16 December 2016.

 2. Judge Mozolowski dismissed the appellant's appeal for reasons explained
    in her decision promulgated on 21 March 2017.

 3. The appellant contends that he  is  a  national  of  Eritrea,  but  the
    respondent and  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  find  that  to  be
    established.

 4. In terms of the Tribunal Procedure (UT) Rules 2008, rule 23  (1A),  the
    appellant's application for permission to  appeal  now  stands  as  the
    notice of appeal to the UT.  It sets out grounds under two headings:

      (1), "errors of law when reaching findings with no or [no]  sufficient
      evidential basis", sub-divided as:

      (i) error at �25 - 26 in findings on the language the appellant  would
      have spoken  with  his  uncle  and  aunt  and  outside  the  home,  in
      particular the judge's  statement  that  she  would  have  anticipated
      bilingualism to be the norm;

      (ii) error at �28 in finding that  the  appellant  could  have  gained
      knowledge from the internet, in absence of evidence of what was on the
      internet; irrationality in light of accepting appellant  had  returned
      to Eritrea for 2 years;

      (iii) findings at �31 not supported by evidence;

      (iv) finding at �33 that appellant might have had a right to reside in
      Ethiopia, not based on any evidence;

       (2), "failing to be slow in drawing adverse inferences from omissions
      at screening interview".

 5. Mr Winter submitted along the lines of  the  grounds,  and  further  as
    follows.  The appellant had explained how it came about that  he  spoke
    only Amharic and not Tigrinya.   His  claim  was  consistent  with  the
    background evidence, as it suggested that many people of his background
    were bilingual, but not all.  It was unusual to make a finding  against
    an  appellant  based  on  having  too  much  accurate  knowledge.   His
    knowledge was accurate but only of basic facts and might well have been
    acquired as he claimed.  There was no real contradiction  arising  from
    the screening interview on 24 June 2016.  The  appellant  was  recorded
    there as saying he was an Orthodox Christian but he  quickly  corrected
    that in  a  letter  from  his  solicitors  dated  11  July  2016.   His
    suggestion was that the interpreter made an incorrect  assumption  when
    he said he was  Christian.   He  also  had  produced  an  adminicle  of
    evidence in support, a letter dated 12  December  2017  confirming  his
    attendance at church [since his arrival in Glasgow].

 6. Mr Matthews submitted thus.  Ground 1 was mainly concerned  to  explain
    away the  appellant's  inability  to  speak  Tigrinya.   No  error  was
    suggested in the judge's summary at �23, 24 and 27  of  the  background
    evidence.  That set the scene for her analysis at �25-26.  The  reasons
    given there were all sound.  At �31 there was no lack  of  evidence  to
    support the conclusion reached; the paragraph sensibly said  there  was
    no good explanation in the appellant's version of events for abandoning
    his young sister, and a planned illegal exit  through  an  agent  would
    take time and money to organise. The  observation  that  the  appellant
    might have had a right to reside in Ethiopia was justified but  it  was
    only an aside  and  not  decisive.   The  finding  on  the  appellant's
    religion was not based only on the record of  the  screening  interview
    but on the nature of his  knowledge  of  Christianity  which  was  more
    consistent with  Orthodoxy  than  with  Pentecostalism  (decision  �38,
    refusal letter �17).  The letter from the church  was  correctly  found
    not to help him very much.  It showed attendance only  subsequently  to
    his claim and the church was  multi-denominational  [that  is  correct,
    although I note the letter does say the congregation is  "predominantly
    Pentecostal"].

 7. I reserved my decision.

 8. There was no need for specific evidence that basic facts about  Eritrea
    are  readily  to  be  found  on  the  internet.  That  is  well  within
    contemporary judicial knowledge.

 9. On inability to speak Tigrinya, the judge reasoned at �25 - 26 thus:

      (i) If Tigrinyan, the appellant would have spoken  Tigrinyan  at  home
      with his uncle and aunt, not Amharic;

      (ii) Prior to  independence,  even  Eritreans  spoke  Amharic  as  the
      official language, but not at home and among friends, and bilingualism
      would be the norm;

      (iii) It would  be  unusual  for  a  Tigrinyan  family  to  perpetuate
      insistence on Amharic;

      (iv) It was significant that the appellant was monolingual;

      (v) He claimed to understand but not speak Tigrinyan, but  if  he  did
      understand it, he would be able to speak it to some extent;

      (vii) He  had  not  verified  his  claim  to  be  able  to  understand
      Tigrinyan;

      (viii) Taking account of the lower standard of proof, he had not shown
      he is Tigrinyan.

10. That is plainly sensible reasoning, derived from  both  the  background
    evidence and the appellant's specific evidence.

11. The judge resolved the issue "without prejudice" to  the  rest  of  the
    appellant's claim - an approach favourable to him.  Her resolution must
    be placed now also in the context that the claim went on  to  fail  "in
    the round".

12. The judge's findings at �31 do not lack an evidential basis.  They  are
    based on rational analysis of the shortcomings of the evidence.

13. The "finding" at �33 is no more than an incidental aside.


14. The judge would be aware of the common principle of exercising  caution
    over screening interviews.  There was a record which  was  inconsistent
    with later claims.  She made no more of that than she  was  within  her
    rational scope, and she had other good reasons, in which  no  error  is
    suggested, for finding the appellant not to be  a  Pentecostalist.   In
    any event, his claim fell at the point of failing to establish that  he
    is Eritrean.

15. The appellant has not shown that the judge's decision  had  no  legally
    adequate basis in the evidence, or that its making involved the  making
    of any other error on a point of law.  His grounds amount  to  no  more
    than insistence and selective disagreement on the facts.

16. The decision of the FtT shall stand.

17. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
