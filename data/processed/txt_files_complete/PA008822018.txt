Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr A Burrett, Counsel, instructed by J D Spicer Zeb
                    Solicitors (83 Kilburn)
For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   On 4 January 2018 the respondent made a decision  to  refuse  to  grant
    asylum or humanitarian  protection  to  the  appellant,  a  citizen  of
    Albania.  Her appeal  came  before  Judge  Raymond  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (FtT) who, in a decision sent on 6 September  2018,  dismissed
    it.  The judge did not find her claim to be  a  victim  of  trafficking
    credible.

2.   The appellant's grounds raise four main arguments, it  being  contended
    that the judge erred in:

    (1)  his approach to assessment of credibility;


    (2)  failing to take into account material evidence;


    (3)  failing to give adequate reasons for rejecting the submission that
         there is inadequate sufficiency of protection in Albania; and


    (4)  committing a procedural  error,  in  failing  to  raise  with  the
         appellant concerns about her claimed time and manner of entry  into
         the UK.

3.   I express my gratitude to Mr Burrett and Ms Everett for  their  careful
    submissions.

4.   It is convenient to address the grounds in reverse order.

5.   Ground (4) is devoid of  merit.   The  respondent's  refusal  decision,
    when detailing her claimed and known immigration history,  stated  that
    she had arrived in the UK clandestinely on 28  April  2016.   That  was
    also the appellant's evidence before the FtT judge.  At  paragraph  146
    the judge concluded that in the light of his adverse  findings  on  her
    asylum narrative, he could not accept this claim, stating: "I  consider
    that she has concealed her time and  manner  of  entry,  which  was  an
    economic migrant".  I would agree that the judge's  treatment  of  the
    issue of the time and manner of  her  arrival  is  problematic  to  the
    extent that her own account regarding this  was  not  disputed  by  the
    respondent and he does not appear to have raised with the  parties  his
    concerns about it.  At  the  same  time,  this  point  clearly  had  no
    material impact on his assessment otherwise and it was not in  dispute,
    nor questioned by the judge, that she had entered the UK illegally.  Mr
    Burrett rightly did not seek to actively support this ground.

6.   I consider ground (3) is also hopeless.  The issue of  the  ability  of
    the  Albanian  authorities  to  provide  protection   to   victims   of
    trafficking was considered in  depth  by  the  Upper  Tribunal  in  the
    country guidance case of TD and AD (Trafficked women) CG [2016] UKUT 92
    (IAC), points (d) to (g) of the head note.  The judge took full account
    of this decision: see paragraphs 3 and 61;  and  also  of  more  recent
    background country materials relating to this issue: see paragraphs  59
    and 63.  These materials were relied on in part to support the  judge's
    assessment that the appellant's trafficking narrative  lacked  credence
    (see paragraph 142).  It was entirely within the  range  of  reasonable
    responses, therefore, for the judge to conclude at paragraph  143  that
    the appellant had not established that she was a victim of trafficking.
     The judge went on in paragraph 144 to state that:

         "144.    Even if I were wrong in so finding I have  concluded  that
             the objective evidence set out  in  detail  in  the  preceding
             establishes  that  there  would  be  sufficient  support   and
             protection  provided  by  the  Albanian  authorities  for  the
             appellant as a trafficked woman in Tirana, the area  that  she
             comes  from,  and  this  would   include   psychological   and
             counselling support, to whatever extent that it  may  be  said
             that these resources need more liberal funding.

7.   What this paragraph materials addresses  are  the  judge's  alternative
    findings.  Any attack on a judge's alternative findings cannot  prosper
    unless the judge's primary findings are found erroneous.  But  even  if
    Judge Raymond's primary findings were  vitiated  by  legal  error  (see
    below), ground (3) does no more than say that the judge's reasoning  on
    the issue of the insufficiency  of  protection  for  the  appellant  is
    inadequate.   If  this  ground  had  sought  to  impugn   the   judge's
    application  of  the  Tribunal  country  guidance  to  the  appellant's
    particular circumstances, this ground may have had some traction.   But
    all it does is refer to "objective evidence", including  the  US  State
    Department Report confirming that Albania still does not  meet  minimum
    standards for the elimination of  trafficking.   The  grounds  fail  to
    explain why it is considered that this evidence undermined the Tribunal
    country guidance.  Hence ground (3) must be rejected.

8.   I am unpersuaded  by  ground  (2).   It  accepts  that  the  judge  was
    entitled to attach less weight to the evidence  from  [S]  (a  lady  of
    Turkish descent who has been accommodating the appellant and  her  son)
    as she was not in attendance on 9 July 2018.  It relies solely  on  the
    judge being wrong in paragraph 130 to state that:

         "There is also the difficulty going to her credibility arising from
         the obscurity surrounding the help available to the appellant  from
         an anonymous friend whilst she has been in the UK,  whom  she  only
         named as '[S]' in her July 2018 statement and who has not  provided
         any evidence in this appeal".

9.   The judge's error is said to be that there was in fact  a  letter  from
    [S] before the FtT.  However, there is no such letter included  in  the
    appellant's bundles.  When asked by me to substantiate the claim in the
    grounds regarding this document, Mr Burrett said he could not find  any
    copy of it in the appellant's file.  Ms Everett said there was no  copy
    of such a letter in the respondent's file.  I was unable  to  find  any
    copy of it in the Tribunal file.  I am simply not prepared to entertain
    an argument that the judge erred in law in failing to take into account
    a material item of evidence, when the appellant's representatives  have
    been unable to substantiate its existence and nothing is to be found in
    the respondent's or Tribunal's files to confirm its  existence  either.
    I also agree with Ms Everett that even if such a letter had been placed
    before the judge, the judge would still have had to bear in  mind  that
    the woman concerned had not attended as a witness, to have her evidence
    tested in cross-examination.

10.  This brings me to ground (1). It is subdivided  into  three  points  of
    challenge, in respect of  the  judge's  treatment  of  the  appellant's
    vulnerability,  his   approach   to   plausibility   and   an   alleged
    misunderstanding the appellant's evidence. In relation to  plausibility
    it is alleged that the judge took plausibility as a "starting point".

11.  Dealing with the first point, Mr Burrett submits that the judge  failed
    to take account of the medical evidence from Professor  Katona  to  the
    effect that the appellant was cognitively impaired.

12.  I discern  no  error  in  the  judge's  treatment  of  the  appellant's
    vulnerability.  The judge expressly stated that  he  was  treating  the
    appellant as a  vulnerable  witness  in  light  of  Professor  Katona's
    report: see  paragraph  79  and  his  decision  also  shows  a  careful
    consideration throughout of the guidance set out by the Court of Appeal
    in AM (Afghanistan) [2017] EWCA Civ 1123 regarding vulnerable witnesses
    and at paragraph  81  the  judge  recorded  the  appellant's  Counsel's
    submissions regarding this:

         "81. Ms Nazima in her submissions drew my attention to the Court of
             Appeal guidance on vulnerable witnesses at paragraphs 20-21 of
             AM (Afghanistan) v Secretary of State for the Home  Department
             &  Lord  Chancellor  [2017]  EWCA  Civ  1123.  Important  core
             principles in asylum determinations include  that  assessments
             of personal credibility were not a substitute for  application
             of  the  criteria  for  refugee  status,  which  had   to   be
             holistically assessed. The  conclusions  of  medical  experts'
             findings had to be treated as part of the holistic assessment.
             Medical evidence  could  be  critical  in  explaining  why  an
             account might be incoherent or inconsistent.  Credibility  had
             to  be  judged  in  the  context  of   the   known   objective
             circumstances  and  practices  of  the  relevant  state.   The
             highest standards of procedural fairness were required."

13.  In the judge's subsequent analysis it is also abundantly clear that  he
    gave very specific consideration to whether the  appellant's  PTSD  and
    the possibility raised by Professor  Katona  of  significant  cognitive
    impairment could explain shortcomings in her evidence.   The  following
    paragraphs are of particular relevance here:

         "80. I had in  mind  what  Professor  Katona  had  said  about  the
             appellant  as  a  vulnerable  witness,  and  allowed  her   an
             adjournment in the course of the morning, as  well  as  taking
             especial  care  in  explaining  questions  to  her   she   had
             difficulty understanding, such as when asked if she  had  been
             given  sexual  health  screening  because  of  her  particular
             history, which she question she did not initially  understand.
             The appellant would make very audible sighs when  being  asked
             questions on occasions during her oral  evidence,  and  on  at
             least one occasion this prompted me to ask say  that  she  was
             very welcome to have a break but she did not wish to  take  up
             the offer.


         ...


         119. It also explains why the appellant, having said in her  asylum
             interview and statements that she was giving money  to  Fajeta
             to buy her things. Thus in her appeal statement - "...I  wish
             to state that Agim did not know that I  was  giving  money  to
             Fajeta and we were both cautious that he  did  not  find  out.
             When I was working I would give her the  money  cautiously  to
             buy things for my son which she would do cautiously" [�21].


         120. She completely reversed  the  position  in  oral  evidence  by
             saying that she only asked Fajeta on the one occasion  to  buy
             food for her son; and went on to add that she never gave money
             to Fajeta; and sighing conspicuously a number  of  times  when
             answering "No" to the question of whether Fajeta had asked her
             where she got her money.


         121. From my observation of her this sighing was not the result  of
             stress  that  a  vulnerable  witness  was   under;   but   the
             frustration of someone being taken back to consideration of an
             obvious flaw in her asylum narrative.


         ...


         127. I find that this change  of  a  core  element  to  her  asylum
             narrative by the appellant is not due to  any  confusion  that
             she  was  under  at  the  hearing  because  of  mental  health
             problems, but because it never had any  actual  basis  in  her
             personal experience. That it was a cynical response by her  to
             the lack of plausibility and inconsistencies identified in the
             NRM decision and refusal in this regard.


         ...


         131. I consider that the cumulative  weight  of  these  substantial
             flaws in the asylum narrative  of  the  appellant,  looked  at
             holistically, and whilst taking into account  as  regards  the
             giving of her oral evidence that she  has  been  diagnosed  as
             suffering from moderate  depression  and  PTSD,  justifies  my
             concluding that it is one which she is fabricated."

14.  These paragraphs not only demonstrate that  the  judge  did  take  into
    account the medical assessment  but  also  gave  a  cogent  reason  for
    concluding that cognitive difficulties could not satisfactorily explain
    identified shortcomings in the appellant's various accounts.

15.  The  grounds  also  take  issue  with  the  judge's  treatment  of  the
    appellant's sighs as relevant to credibility, alleging  that  this  was
    akin to reliance on a point of demeanour also  contrary  to  the  broad
    disapproval of demeanour as an indicator of credibility (see  KB  &  AH
    (credibility - structured approach) Pakistan [2017] UKUT 491 (IAC).  I
    am not persuaded that the judge's treatment of the appellant's  sighing
    discloses an error of law: the judge's  reference  to  the  appellant's
    sighing arose in the context of considering  and  evaluating  an  overt
    contradiction between her appeal statement and oral testimony regarding
    whether she had ever given money to the woman,  F,  who  she  said  was
    tasked by traffickers to look  after  her  son.   What  the  judge  was
    considering was whether her sighing  could  have  been  the  result  of
    "stress that a vulnerable witness was under".  In other words, it was a
    consideration of whether the sighing could be (part of) an  explanation
    for her inconsistency.  That is  different  from  treating  sighing  as
    evidence of lack of credibility.

16.  So far as concerns the challenge raised in the grounds to  the  judge's
    plausibility findings,  I  see  nothing  in  the  judge's  decision  to
    indicate that he took plausibility as a  starting  point  or  otherwise
    relied unduly on matters of plausibility.  Read as a whole, the judge's
    adverse  credibility  findings  identify  a  number  of   shortcomings,
    including in relation to a lack of internal  and  external  consistency
    (see e.g. paragraphs 102, 107, 110, 113, 114, 118-121,  127,  128,  141
    and 142).  It is also clear that the judge  considered  the  extent  to
    which the appellant's account showed a sufficiency of detail (see  e.g.
    paragraph 130).

17.  The third point raised within the appellant's ground  (1)  argues  that
    the judge misunderstood the appellant's evidence regarding whether  the
    women the appellant said she  was  working  with  as  (trafficked)  sex
    workers used contraception.  Reference is made to paragraph  139  where
    the  judge  stated  that  the  appellant  could  not  remember  in  her
    substantive interview whether these women used contraception.  That was
    said to be a misunderstanding because the appellant had only  said  she
    could not remember what type  of  contraception.   This  ground  simply
    neglects to mention that the judge only relied in paragraph 139 on  the
    fact that the appellant did not "initially" remember this.  That was  a
    fair reading of the interview record.

18.  For the above reasons, I conclude that the  judge  did  not  materially
    err in law and accordingly his  decision  to  dismiss  the  appellant's
    appeal must stand.

No anonymity direction is made.
