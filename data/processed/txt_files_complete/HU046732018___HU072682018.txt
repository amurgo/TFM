Anonymity
Rule 14: The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
Anonymity was granted at an earlier stage of  the  proceedings  because  the
case involved consideration of child welfare  issues.  I  find  that  it  is
appropriate to continue the order. Unless and  until  a  tribunal  or  court
directs otherwise, the appellants are granted anonymity. No report of  these
proceedings shall directly or indirectly identify  them  or  any  member  of
their  family.  This  direction  applies  to  the  appellants  and  to   the
respondent.


Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr M. Biggs, instructed by A Y & J Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr E. Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    The  first  appellant  ("the  appellant")  appealed  the  respondent's
    decision dated 30 January 2018 to refuse a human rights  claim  in  the
    context of an application for leave to remain  on  the  grounds  of  10
    years' lawful residence. The respondent refused the  application  under
    paragraph 322(5) of the immigration rules because it was undesirable to
    permit the appellant to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  due  to  his
    character and conduct. Large discrepancies  in  the  amount  of  income
    claimed to the UKBA for the purpose of applications for leave to remain
    and the amounts claimed to the HMRC for tax purposes showed that he had
    acted dishonestly. Either he had falsely exaggerated his income for the
    purpose of meeting the requirements of the immigration rules or made  a
    false declaration of his income to reduce his tax liability.

2.    First-tier Tribunal Judge  A.M.  Black  ("the  judge")  dismissed  the
    appeal in a decision promulgated on 30 August 2018. She considered  the
    decision  in  R  (Khan)  v  SSHD  (Dishonesty,  tax  return,  paragraph
    322(5))[2018] UKUT 384 and concluded that the respondent  was  entitled
    to consider, as a starting point, the large discrepancies  between  the
    income claimed to UKBA and  declared  to  HMRC  [21-25].  She  reminded
    herself that the respondent  bore  the  initial  evidential  burden  of
    proving dishonesty [27-29]. The judge went on to consider the substance
    of the evidence before her. She noted the significant discrepancies  in
    the figures [31]. In March 2011 the appellant claimed total earnings of
    �41,886.42 in an application for leave to remain. The proportion earned
    from employment was only �7,855.42 and the rest  was  claimed  to  come
    from dividend income earned from the appellant's claimed business as an
    IT  consultant.  The  claimed  dividend   income   was   �34,000.   The
    discrepancies did not occur in a single tax year, but occurred  in  two
    separate years that coincided with the appellant applying for leave  to
    remain. The judge noted that in September 2013 the  appellant  made  an
    application for further leave to remain in which he claimed earnings of
    �41,445 of which �14,445 was from employment. The remainder was said to
    come from self-employed income from his business.

3.    In contrast, the judge noted that the HMRC records showed that in  the
    tax  year  2010-2011  the  appellant  declared  no  income  from  self-
    employment or other sources (including dividends). In the tax year 2011-
    2012 he only declared �33,689 employed income. For  2012-2013  he  only
    declared �38,508  employed  income.  For  2013-2013  he  only  declared
    �22,125 employed income. The judge noted that  these  figures  did  not
    even approach the level of income claimed in the two  applications  for
    leave to remain in 2011 and 2013 [32-33]. She considered other evidence
    before her and concluded that the respondent had discharged the initial
    evidential burden of proof to show prima facie evidence of deception or
    dishonesty [46].

4.    The  judge  turned  to  consider  the  explanations  provided  by  the
    appellant in response to the allegation  of  dishonesty.  She  was  not
    satisfied that the appellant provided a credible  explanation  for  the
    discrepancies. The judge went through his explanations and the evidence
    in some detail [48-60]. She found:

         "48.      As  regards  the  failure  to  declare  his  income  from
             dividends for the tax year 2010/2011, I give little weight  to
             the fact that the unpaid tax on dividends was  relatively  low
             at �657.99. It is unlikely that the first appellant, who is an
             intelligent man with the benefit of  professional  accountancy
             advice from the outset of setting  up  his  company,  did  not
             appreciate he had to pay tax on  his  income  from  dividends.
             Even if he did not read the tax return himself or the guidance
             which accompanies it, as an intelligent man who has set  up  a
             company for the provision of IT services, he could  reasonable
             expect to pay tax on any income received from  it.  I  do  not
             accept that simply because he had instructed an accountant  he
             did not look at the tax return before he signed and  submitted
             it;  indeed  he  told  me  he  would  normally  look  at   it.
             Furthermore, he would have been advised by his  accountant  to
             read it carefully before signing it. It is  not  suggest  that
             the first appellant's personal circumstances were stressful at
             the time  he  set  up  the  company  and  filed,  through  his
             accountant,  the  tax  return  relating  to  his   income   in
             2010/2011. Given that  he  had  the  benefit  of  professional
             advice at that time, I find  it  unlikely  he  overlooked  the
             requirement to pay tax on the company dividend."

5.    The judge also considered whether the appellant's explanation that  he
    was under stress at the time was credible. She gave reasons to  explain
    why did not find those personal issues would have affected his  ability
    to check two tax  returns  in  different  years.  She  noted  that  the
    appellant's claimed income from the business for the years in which  he
    made applications for leave to remain did not accord with the  declared
    income from other tax years. She noted, at best, it was  reasonable  to
    infer that the appellant invoiced clients  shortly  before  he  had  to
    apply for leave to remain, but at worst, the  figures  were  unreliable
    [53]. She went on to find:

         "54.     The first appellant's evidence is that he had been told my
             an immigration lawyer that his tax affairs would be checked in
             connection with  his  proposed  application  [for]  indefinite
             leave to remain on the grounds of long residence. He  says  he
             then sought copies of his tax return from HMRC and it  was  at
             that stage that the discrepancies  came  to  light.  I  accept
             that."

6.    The judge took into account other discrepancies in the evidence  given
    by the appellant and his wife, which undermined his overall credibility
    as a witness [55-58]. The judge had the opportunity of hearing evidence
    from the appellant at the hearing. She considered his  evidence  to  be
    "confused  and  muddled"  and  observed  that  his  oral  evidence  was
    "evasive, vague and confused". She concluded:

         "60.     I find that the appellants are not  credible  or  reliable
             witnesses. They have fabricated and embellished their evidence
             to  demonstrate  the  first  appellant  has  a  reasonable  or
             innocent explanation for  the  discrepancies  in  the  figures
             claimed for his earnings and declared by way of income.  I  am
             satisfied that the first  appellant  did  not  earn  the  sums
             claimed to the respondent in March 2011  and  September  2013.
             The  fluctuations  in  the  profit  and  loss   accounts   are
             sufficiently concerning as to suggest that the first appellant
             had inflated his earnings to enable him to be  awarded  points
             as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant. [Such] a finding is  consistent
             with his wife's declaration in August 2016 that  they  had  no
             income  from  self-employment.  I  am  satisfied   the   first
             appellant sought to deceive and did deceive the respondent  in
             the two applications and that he had  no  entitlement  to  the
             award of points. I bear  in  mind  that  the  first  appellant
             submitted  invoices,  bank  statements,  accounts  and   other
             documents in support of those applications, but I consider the
             tax returns filed  by  the  first  appellant  on  professional
             advice are more persuasive. I am satisfied the first appellant
             knew he did not earn sufficient income from his work  for  the
             Co-op and that he set up the company as a means to demonstrate
             additional income for the purpose  of  reaching  the  required
             threshold for the award of points as a Tier 1 Migrant. I  have
             considered whether he earned some income  as  a  self-employed
             person but  am  unable  to  find  as  much:  his  evidence  is
             inconsistent and unreliable and I am unable to  make  positive
             findings on the issue, despite  the  tax  returns  which  were
             filed by  him.  I  am  satisfied  the  first  appellant  acted
             dishonestly in claiming in March 2011 and September 2013  that
             he earned �41,866.42 and �41,445 respectively."

7.    The judge went on to conclude that  the  respondent  was  entitled  to
    refuse the application under paragraph 322(5) of the immigration rules.
    He did not meet any of the requirements for leave to remain on  grounds
    of his  private  or  family  life  under  the  immigration  rules.  She
    considered the best interests of the child and took  into  account  her
    young age. She also considered the public interest factors outlined  in
    section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 ("NIAA
    2002") before concluding that removal of the appellant and  his  family
    would not amount to a disproportionate breach of Article 8.

8.    The appellant was granted permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal.
    In a decision promulgated on 13 March 2019 Deputy Upper Tribunal  Judge
    Sutherland Williams found that there was no error of law in the  First-
    tier Tribunal decision.  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Gleeson  reviewed  the
    decision pursuant to an application for permission  to  appeal  to  the
    Court of Appeal. She  set  aside  the  Deputy  Upper  Tribunal  Judge's
    decision for the following reasons:

         "3.      I am satisfied that the decision of the Court of Appeal in
             Balajigari v The Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department
             [2019] EWCA Civ 673 handed down on 16 April 2019, had it  been
             made before the Upper Tribunal's decision, could  have  had  a
             material effect on the decision in this appeal."

9.    Judge Gleeson did not explain how or why the  decision  in  Balajigari
    might have made a difference, but the consequence of setting aside  the
    Upper Tribunal decision is that the appeal comes before  me  to  decide
    whether the First-tier Tribunal decision  involved  the  making  of  an
    error of law.

10.   The original  grounds  of  appeal  argued  that  the  judge  (i)  made
    inconsistent  findings;  (ii)  made  irrational  findings;  and   (iii)
    unfairly took into account matters that were not put to  the  appellant
    to answer at the hearing. At the hearing before the Upper  Tribunal  Mr
    Biggs focussed his submissions on the following points:

    (i)    The judge's apparent acceptance of the  appellant's  explanation
         that he only discovered the discrepancies when he was preparing the
         application for ILR [54] was inconsistent with her conclusion  that
         the appellant was dishonest (and by  inference  must  have  already
         known about the discrepancies) in the  applications  for  leave  to
         remain made in 2011 and 2013.

    (ii)   The judge's finding at [48] that his failure to declare dividend
         income was irrational given that tax is paid on dividend income  at
         source and she accepted that the outstanding  tax  of  �657.99  was
         "relatively low".

    (iii)  The judge's finding at [48], that the appellant would have  been
         advised by his accountant to check and sign the tax  return  before
         signing it, was based on speculation.  There  was  no  evidence  to
         suggest that was so advised.

    (iv)   The judge failed to put to the appellant her concern  about  the
         two different accountants [37]. The appellant's  explanation  would
         have been that it was the same accountant who changed the name  and
         address of the firm. Her calculation regarding  the  invoices  that
         the appellant claimed that he failed to provide to  his  accountant
         for the tax  year  2013-2014  could  have  been  explained  by  the
         appellant if they fell within the lower  range  calculated  by  the
         judge [50]. The appellant was not asked why he might have a  higher
         income in the years in which he made applications for further leave
         to remain.

Decision and reasons

11.   After having considered the grounds of appeal  and  oral  arguments  I
    find that there is no error of law in the First-tier Tribunal decision.



12.   The judge noted at [41] that the appellant produced evidence  to  show
    that HMRC wrote to his accountant, Gohil's Accountancy Services Ltd, on
    10 November 2016. The letter indicated that the appellant had  notified
    HMRC of the fact that there was additional tax to pay,  which  was  not
    previously declared. She noted that the date of the letter was  broadly
    consistent with the appellant's  claim  that  he  only  discovered  the
    discrepancy in his tax return when he was preparing the application for
    ILR in 2016. It indicates that the appellant sought to  amend  the  tax
    return. It  is  likely  that  this  evidence  underpinned  the  judge's
    comments at [54] where she noted the appellant's evidence as to when he
    claimed to have discovered the discrepancy in the tax return for  2013-
    2014.

13.   It is alleged that the judge made inconsistent  findings  because  she
    appeared to accept the appellant's evidence. However, in my  assessment
    her finding in [54] is somewhat  unclear.  The  most  she  appeared  to
    accept was that the appellant was advised  by  the  immigration  lawyer
    that his tax affairs would be checked in connection with  the  proposed
    application for ILR. The  evidence  she  referred  to  from  HMRC  only
    acknowledged that the appellant had contacted HMRC in order to  correct
    errors that had come to light.  The  judge  noted  that  the  appellant
    claimed that it was only at this point that  he  became  aware  of  the
    discrepancy in so far as it related to the 2013-2014 tax return. Having
    made three separate statements in [54] it is not clear  which  one  she
    was referring to when she stated: "I accept that". When this finding is
    read in the context of her  other  findings  it  is  not  as  clear  or
    emphatic as the appellant asserts.

14.   Even if the appellant was advised by his immigration lawyer  that  his
    tax affairs would be checked when he prepared the  ILR  application  in
    2016, and subsequently contacted HMRC to correct  the  tax  return,  it
    does not necessarily follow that he  was  unaware  of  the  discrepancy
    before then. The judge made clear at [58] that she placed little weight
    on the fact that the appellant amended the tax return and paid any  tax
    that purported to be owed  after  the  fact.  At  highest  the  judge's
    findings in [41] and [54] merely acknowledged evidence that  lent  some
    support to the appellant's account. That was a proper approach for  her
    to take. Elsewhere in the decision she gave numerous reasons,  most  of
    which are unchallenged, for  finding  that  the  appellant  was  not  a
    credible  or  reliable  witness.  Having  weighed  the  evidence,   she
    concluded that he had been  dishonest.  The  finding  in  [54]  is  not
    sufficiently clear or precise to conclude that it conflicted  with  her
    other findings in such a way as to amount to an error of law.

15.   It is not arguable that the judge's findings at [48] were  irrational.
    It was open to the judge to infer that a professional accountant  would
    advise his or her client to check and sign the tax return before it  is
    filed. It matters not when the  appellant  confirmed  that  he  usually
    checked his tax returns in any event. Given that the appellant  claimed
    that his income from dividend payments in the tax year 2011-2012 formed
    the large bulk of the income claimed in the application  for  leave  to
    remain made in 2011 (�34,000 of a total of �41,886.42 claimed  income),
    it was within a range of reasonable responses to the evidence  for  the
    judge to conclude that  it  was  unlikely  that  the  appellant  simply
    overlooked the need to declare dividend income, especially in  view  of
    the fact that he had professional advice from an  accountant.  While  I
    acknowledge that dividend income is largely taxed from source, Mr Biggs
    accepted that there was a requirement to declare dividend income  after
    a certain level. �34,000 was  clearly  within  the  range  of  dividend
    income that should be declared. It was open to the judge to  find  that
    it was not plausible that the appellant and his accountant  would  both
    overlook such a high level of claimed dividend  income  when  preparing
    his personal tax return.

16.   In my assessment, the three points raised  in  support  of  the  third
    ground relating to procedural fairness would not,  either  individually
    or taken together, have led to a  different  outcome.  It  matters  not
    whether the judge misunderstood that the  earlier  accountant  was  the
    same person. In the absence of any  evidence  from  any  accountant  to
    explain the alleged errors any clarification by the  appellant  at  the
    hearing would have made no material difference to the outcome.  It  was
    open to the judge to take into account  the  figures  relating  to  the
    turnover of the business contained in the  profit  and  loss  accounts.
    Those accounts, on the appellant's own evidence,  were  the  ones  that
    were used to prepare the business accounts. Regardless  of  whether  he
    provided all the relevant invoices  to  his  accountant,  the  accounts
    purported to show disproportionate levels of turnover in the two  years
    when the appellant made applications for leave to remain compared  with
    the other years when he did not have an  incentive  to  exaggerate  his
    claimed level of income. It was open to the  judge,  in  assessing  the
    evidence as a whole, to take those figures  into  account.  No  further
    evidence has been produced to suggest what  explanation  the  appellant
    might have provided in response  that  would  have  made  any  material
    difference to the judge's overall credibility findings.

17.   It is unclear why Judge Gleeson  thought  that  the  Court  of  Appeal
    decision in Balajigari might have made any material difference  to  the
    outcome of this appeal. No argument was put forward in the  grounds  of
    appeal for permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal.  No  point  was
    pursued at the hearing. On the face of  it  there  is  nothing  in  the
    decision that would make any material difference to the outcome of  the
    First-tier Tribunal decision in this case. The  appellant  applied  for
    ILR and was given a right of appeal. He had an opportunity  to  address
    the issues raised by the respondent in the decision letter.  The  judge
    made a factual assessment based on the evidence. It  is  understandable
    that the appellant disagrees with the judge's findings, but  they  were
    within a range of reasonable responses to the evidence.
