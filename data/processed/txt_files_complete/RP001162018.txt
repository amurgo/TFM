Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr J Howard, instructed by Fountain Solicitors
(Walsall)
For the Respondent:    Mr A McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 (SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order. Unless the Upper Tribunal
    or a Court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings  or  any
    form of publication thereof shall directly or indirectly  identify  the
    appellant in  this  determination  identified  as  WW.  This  direction
    applies to, amongst others, all parties. Any  failure  to  comply  with
    this direction could give rise to contempt of court proceedings



      1. The appellant, a non-Arab Darfur Sudanese citizen born in 1987 came
         to the UK in 2005 and claimed asylum. Although his asylum claim was
         initially refused, he was eventually recognised  as  a  refugee  in
         November 2010 with leave to remain until 24th November 2015. He did
         not apply to extend his  leave  to  remain,  although  his  refugee
         status continues until revoked.

      2. On 20th July 2018, a  deportation  order  was  signed  against  him
         following sentencing for criminal offending[1]. The respondent,  in
         that decision, set out his reasons  for  revoking  the  appellant's
         refugee status; certified, in accordance with 72(9)(b)  Nationality
         Immigration and Asylum Act  2002,  that  the  appellant'  had  been
         convicted  of  a  particularly  serious  crime  and  his  continued
         presence in the UK constituted a danger to the community  and  thus
         the presumption under  s72(2)  applied;  refused  protection  under
         article 2 and 3 ECHR (Humanitarian protection); that in  any  event
         he is excluded from protection under paragraph  339D(iii)  &  (iv);
         and that there were no very compelling circumstances over and above
         those described in s117C(4) and/or (5).

      3.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  judge  correctly  considered  the   s72
         certificate first and then went on to consider the  other  elements
         of the appellant's claim. The judge found

           . The appellant failed to rebut the s72 presumption that  he  is
             and remains a danger to the community;

           . There was insufficient evidence to support the  revocation  of
             his refugee status  such  that  the  appellant  made  out  his
             Refugee Convention claim as a non-Arab Darfuri from the  Berti
             tribe (not  on  the  grounds  of  his  political  activity  or
             opinion), but he was, because of the s72 certificate, excluded
             from protection.

           . The appellant has not demonstrated that his  return  to  Sudan
             would be a breach of his Article 2 and/or 3 rights;

           . There are not very significant obstacles to his  reintegration
             to Sudan; he has not been lawfully resident in the UK for most
             of his life, he is not socially and culturally  integrated  in
             the UK and there are not very  compelling  circumstances  over
             and above those set out in s117C(4) and or (5).

      4. The appellant sought, and was granted, permission to  appeal  on  3
         grounds, although in fact grounds 1 & 2 are in  essence  the  same:
         that it having been accepted that the  appellant  was  at  risk  of
         being persecuted for a Convention reason as a non-Arab Darfur  from
         Sudan, the First-tier Tribunal failed to give reasons  for  finding
         he was not at Article 3 risk. Ground  3  was  that  the  judge  had
         failed to give adequate reasons why the evidence of a  witness  was
         not sufficient to rebut the presumption that the  appellant  was  a
         risk to the community.

      5. The respondent did not cross-appeal the finding of  the  First-tier
         Tribunal that the appellant was at risk of being persecuted  for  a
         Convention reason as a non-Arab Darfuri from Sudan.

         Error of Law

      6. In considering risk under Article 3, the First-tier Tribunal  judge
         has considered issues  of  destitution/hardship  (relying  upon  MA
         (Somalia) [2018] EWCA Civ 994 to dismiss the appeal  on  Article  3
         grounds) rather than issues of serious harm/persecution. Mr McVeety
         acknowledged that there had been no consideration by the  judge  of
         the risk of persecution and serious harm which, in the  context  of
         the refugee findings which were not under challenge, was  an  error
         of law.

      7. I am satisfied that the First-tier Tribunal judge erred in  law  in
         his Article 3 finding on the risk of being persecuted and set aside
         that element of the decision to be remade.

      8. In so far as the  s72  certificate  is  concerned,  the  First-tier
         Tribunal judge set out the evidence before  him  which  included  a
         summary of the evidence of Mr Liggett. Mr Liggett described himself
         in his letter in support as a personal friend who has known him for
         the last 5 ï¿½ years, initially  visiting  him  in  prison  and  then
         keeping in touch after his release. My attention was  drawn  to  Mr
         Liggett's oral evidence that he was aware that the offence involved
         robbery, violence and a knife; this is recorded in  the  First-tier
         Tribunal decision. Mr Howard submitted that the judge's  conclusion
         that Mr Liggett was not fully informed of the nature of the offence
         was a conclusion drawn  without  adequate  reasons,  and  had  that
         conclusion not been drawn, the balance to be struck may  well  have
         been different.

      9. The First-tier Tribunal  judge  accurately  recorded  Mr  Liggett's
         evidence. He also sets out the other evidence before him  including
         a letter from the National probation Service and the OASys  report.
         He records that the probation letter assesses the appellant  as  at
         high risk of serious to the public and medium risk to a known adult
         and that the risk was imminent given the  offence  was  financially
         motivated. His finding, given  the  nature  of  the  offence[2]  as
         described in the sentencing remarks and the OASys report,  that  Mr
         Liggett was unaware of the totality of the offence  was  a  finding
         that was plainly open to him. The judge set  out  that  he  had  to
         balance the factors for and against the appellant.  In  considering
         the evidence, the judge took account of the extent  and  nature  of
         the  offence,  including  that  the  sentencing  judge   found   no
         mitigating factors.

     10. I am satisfied that the objection by the appellant to  the  finding
         that he had not rebutted the s72 presumption is  no  more  than  an
         objection. The First-tier Tribunal judge took account  of  all  the
         factors and matters before him and reached a  conclusion  that  was
         plainly open to him, setting out detailed reasons for his  findings
         that cannot reasonably be undermined. I am satisfied  there  is  no
         error of law by the First-tier  Tribunal  judge  in  upholding  the
         certificate.

     11. I set aside the First-tier  Tribunal  decision  in  so  far  as  it
         relates to the Article 3 finding on persecution/serious harm only.

         Remaking the decision

     12. I notified both parties at the  conclusion  of  the  hearing  that,
         given the refugee finding, I would find that the appellant  was  at
         risk of a breach of his Article 3  rights  if  deported  to  Sudan.
         Neither party dissented from  this  nor  made  submissions  to  the
         contrary.

     13. The only issue outstanding at the end of the  hearing  was  whether
         the  judge  had  made  an  error  of  law  in  upholding  the   s72
         certificate. Given my finding that there is  no  error  of  law,  I
         remake the decision allowing the appeal on Article 3 grounds -  the
         appellant is, as a non-Arab Darfuri at risk of being persecuted and
         thus suffering serious harm if deported to Sudan.

    Conclusions:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law in so far as  his  conclusions  on
    whether there would be a breach of Article 3 were concerned.

    I set aside the decision on that limited basis and remake the  decision
    by allowing it on Article 3 human rights grounds only.

    Anonymity

    The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i)
    of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.

    I make that order (pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper
    Tribunal) Rules 2008).
