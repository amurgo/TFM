Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms A Bailey-Perkins, Solicitor for Synthesis
Chambers
For the Respondent:    Ms Z Ahmad, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the remaking of the decision  in  the  appeal  of  Mrs  Sanchez
    (hereafter the Appellant) against the  decision  of  the  Secretary  of
    State (hereafter the Respondent), dated 20 February 2015, in which  her
    human rights claim was  refused  and  directions  were  given  for  her
    removal under section 10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.   This
    resumed hearing follows on from my decision promulgated on 19 September
    2016 in which I found that the First-tier Tribunal had materially erred
    in law.  My error of law decision is set out in full at Annex 1.

 2. In summary, I concluded that the First-tier  Tribunal  had  misdirected
    itself in law as to the interpretation of Appendix FM EX.1 and EX.2  to
    the Immigration Rules, and that material matters  had  not  been  taken
    into account in respect of the Article  8  assessment  outside  of  the
    Rules.  There was in addition a lack of clear findings  in  respect  of
    the question of whether or not the Appellant could meet the Rules if an
    entry clearance application was to be made from the  Philippines.   The
    First-tier Tribunal decision was therefore set aside.




The scope of the remake decision

 3. At the end of my error of law decision I stated what  the  live  issues
    for consideration at the resumed hearing would be:  EX.1  and  EX.2  of
    Appendix FM; Article 8 outside of the  Rules,  including  the  possible
    application of the principle set out in Chikwamba with reference to the
    decision of the Upper Tribunal in Chen.




The hearing before me: the evidence

 4. I have before me two bundles from the Appellant,  now  marked  AB1  and
    AB2.  AB1 is the bundle that was before the First-tier Tribunal and  is
    paginated 1 to 123.  AB2 is a new  bundle  prepared  for  this  resumed
    hearing and is paginated 1 to 56.  I have admitted  the  second  bundle
    into evidence and there has been no objection from  the  Respondent  to
    this course of action.  In addition I have  the  original  Respondent's
    appeal bundle.  In remaking the decision  I  have  taken  all  of  this
    evidence into account.




The hearing before me: submissions

 5. Miss Bailey-Perkins acknowledged that the judge had found  against  the
    Appellant in respect of the  twenty  years'  residence  in  the  United
    Kingdom and in respect of paragraph 276ADE of  the  Rules.  Neither  of
    these findings had been challenged by  way  of  cross-appeal  and  Miss
    Bailey-Perkins recognised that these were no longer live issues  before
    me.  Miss Bailey-Perkins relied on her skeleton argument  contained  in
    AB2.  She  submitted  that  in  this  case  there  were  insurmountable
    obstacles to the family life between the Appellant and her husband (the
    sponsor) continuing in the Philippines.  She relied  on  the  following
    factors:

      a) the sponsor was British and had lived in this country since 1970;

      b) the sponsor is in full-time  employment  as  the  caretaker  for  a
         property in London;

      c) the sponsor's accommodation is provided through work;

      d) the Appellant's stepson (the sponsor's son) is now aged twenty-two,
         and has just graduated from university.  He is  living  and  always
         has lived with the sponsor and there is a close  bond  between  the
         Appellant and her stepson.   It  is  submitted  that  the  Kugathas
         threshold is met in this case in respect of the existence of family
         life as  between  the  Appellant  and  her  stepson.   There  is  a
         relationship between the Appellant and her  mother-in-law  and  the
         sponsor's other family members in this country;

      e) the sponsor has never been to the Philippines;

      f) the sponsor does not speak the language of the Philippines;

      g) the employment prospects both for the  Appellant  and  the  sponsor
         would be minimal given the lack of ties to that country  and  their
         respective ages;

      h) there has been no misconduct on the part of the Appellant  in  this
         country;

      i) the Appellant has done all she could  to  try  and  regularise  her
         status in this country following a period of overstaying;

      j) the Appellant has spent many years away from the Philippines.   She
         has little or no ties to that country, and although it is  accepted
         that her mother, two  brothers  and  a  sister  reside  there,  the
         contact between them  is  irregular  and  they  could  not  provide
         assistance upon return;

      k) the Appellant has no assets in the Philippines.

 6.  In  respect  of  the  prospects  of  success  of  an  entry  clearance
    application made from the  Philippines,  Miss  Bailey-Perkins  took  me
    through the evidence in  AB2  as  to  the  sponsor's  employment.   She
    referred me to the employer's letter at page 15 AB2 and the payslips at
    pages 17 to 22 AB2 covering a  period  six  months  between  March  and
    August 2016.  In addition I saw the pay  slip  for  September  of  this
    year.  Bank statements started at page 23 AB2 and covered the same six-
    month period as set out in the payslips.  The  wages  are  shown  going
    into that bank account under the heading "Esskey client".   In  respect
    of accommodation, the Appellant and the sponsor live  together  in  the
    accommodation provided through the sponsor's work.  There is  no  issue
    as to the couple's marriage and the fact that here  is  a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship.  It is also accepted by  the  Respondent  that
    the sponsor is British.

 7. In respect of whether a  temporary  separation  for  the  Appellant  to
    return to the Philippines and make an entry clearance  application  was
    possible, Miss Bailey-Perkins submitted that this would on the facts of
    this case be disproportionate having regard to what is said in the case
    of Chen.  There is a  family  unit,  who  all  live  together  in  this
    country.  If the Appellant went back to  the  Philippines  the  sponsor
    would have to pay for any expenses whilst she was there This would be a
    financial burden upon him.  In addition there  was  an  emotional  bond
    between the Appellant, stepson  and  the  sponsor  and  this  would  be
    broken, at least temporarily.  The Appellant's immigration  history  is
    not particularly poor.  Miss Bailey-Perkins submitted that as  of  July
    2015 the approximate time to process entry clearance  applications  was
    between 60 and 120 working  days.   The  cost  of  travel,  making  the
    application and the expenses whilst there would all be significant.

 8. Miss Ahmad submitted that the threshold set out in EX.1 and EX.2 was  a
    high one as per Agyarko at paragraphs 21 and 25.  The factors relied on
    by the Appellant in this case were simply not enough.  The situation on
    return for the couple may be difficult but they  would  not  amount  to
    insurmountable obstacles.  The Appellant has family there who should be
    able to provide at least some support.

 9. In respect of the Chikwamba issue and seen in the context of  the  Chen
    case, there were two aspects to any possible success under  Article  8:
    the Appellant would need to show first of all that she could succeed in
    the entry clearance application  and  also  that  temporary  separation
    would be disproportionate in all the circumstances.  Miss Ahmad did not
    challenge any of the financial evidence and accepted that this evidence
    would meet requirements of Appendix FM-SE to the  Rules.   However,  in
    this case there were no young children involved, there was no  evidence
    that either the sponsor or  his  son  could  not  survive  without  the
    Appellant for a temporary period of time.  Miss  Ahmad  submitted  that
    this was not simply a pragmatic matter but in light of Chen it was down
    to  the  Appellant  to  show  that  there  would  be   really   serious
    difficulties if she were to go back to  the  Philippines  and  make  an
    entry clearance application.  In terms of  Article  8  outside  of  the
    Rules, I was to have regard to the factors set out in section  117B  of
    the 2002 Act. In light of  the  Appellant's  unlawful  status  in  this
    country for many years a temporary separation in  this  case  would  be
    justified.

10. In reply  Miss  Bailey-Perkins  submitted  that  there  would  be  very
    significant difficulties in finding employment in the Philippines,  the
    evidence suggested that the family in the Philippines would not be able
    to assist the Appellant and her sponsor.  The effect on the family unit
    as a whole whether the separation was permanent or temporary  would  be
    significant.




My findings of fact

11. There have been no challenges to the credibility of  the  evidence  put
    before me at any time.  I have no reason to doubt what is said  on  the
    face of the evidence to which I have  had  regard.   I  find  that  the
    Appellant and the sponsor are  credible  and  the  evidence  they  have
    provided is reliable insofar as it goes.  I find that the  relationship
    between the Appellant and the sponsor is and always has been  perfectly
    genuine and subsisting.  I find that the Appellant  has  been  in  this
    country for a significant period of time although not  for  the  twenty
    years that she initially claimed (see  the  preserved  finding  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal at paragraph 48 of Judge  Malcolm's  decision).   I
    find that the Appellant arrived in this country as a  visitor  but  has
    been here unlawfully since the expiration of that very  limited  leave.
    I find that at all material times her status  has  been  unlawful,  and
    that the relationship with the sponsor was initiated and has  continued
    in that context.

12. I do find that the Appellant has taken steps  since  2010  to  try  and
    regularise her status in one way or another through applications to the
    Respondent. There have also been certain delays by  the  Respondent  in
    dealing with the applications.  I find that the sponsor is and had been
    employed as  claimed,  and  that  his  accommodation  is  tied  to  his
    employment.  I find that the  Appellant  and  the  sponsor  have  lived
    together.  I find that the sponsor's son is now  twenty-two  years  old
    and has indeed recently graduated  from  his  degree  course.   I  will
    accept that the sponsor's son  has  lived  with  the  sponsor  and  the
    Appellant throughout including during his time at university.  I accept
    that there is a close bond between the Appellant and the sponsor's son.
     This is perhaps not surprising given the solidity of her  relationship
    with the sponsor and the time that  they  have  known  each  other.   I
    accept that the sponsor's son's own mother effectively kicked  him  out
    of home when he was a  teenager  and  that  he  has  come  to  see  the
    Appellant as his real mother (see page 119 AB1).

13. I find that the Appellant,  sponsor  and  the  sponsor's  son  are  all
    healthy individuals.

14. I accept that the sponsor has other family members in this country, but
    there is no evidence in respect  of  any  particularly  close  ties  or
    dependency going above and beyond  the  normal  emotional  ties  to  be
    expected as between adult relatives.

15. I find that the sponsor has never in fact been to the Philippines,  and
    that he does not speak Tagalog or Spanish.

16. In respect of employment prospects in the Philippines I am  left  in  a
    position of having very little independent evidence on this issue.   It
    is true that the Appellant and the sponsor are middle-aged (if I  could
    put it that way): that does not of  itself  mean  that  such  prospects
    would be minimal, but I would accept  that  they  would  be  less  than
    ideal.  I do not have any independent evidence about the cost of living
    in the Philippines.  I accept that the  Appellant  does  not  have  any
    assets in that country.

17. In terms of her familial ties in that country I find  that  she  has  a
    mother living there, two brothers and one sister plus her own two adult
    children.  I accept that there  is  a  poor  relationship  between  the
    Appellant and her two older children. However I do not accept that  the
    other family members would simply be unable or  refuse  to  assist  the
    Appellant and the  sponsor  in  any  way  should  they  return  to  the
    Philippines together, or indeed if the Appellant were to  return  alone
    in order to make an application.  The evidence to which I was  referred
    at page 19 AB1 does not support Miss  Bailey-Perkins'  contention  that
    any such help would simply not be forthcoming.  It may be that  contact
    is fairly irregular but that is not to say that if the proposition were
    put to them, some assistance, whether financial, emotional or practical
    were asked for it would not be forthcoming.

18.  In  respect  of  the  prospects  of  success  of  an  entry  clearance
    application made from the Philippines, I find on the evidence before me
    that it is highly likely that entry clearance would in fact be granted.
     I find the financial evidence to be both reliable  and  in  compliance
    with the particular requirements of  Appendix  FM-SE.   The  employer's
    letter, payslips and the bank statements tick all of the relevant boxes
    in terms of mandatory  information,  and  they  cover  the  appropriate
    period.  There is and always has been adequate  accommodation  and  the
    couple are in a genuine and subsisting relationship.  The sponsor is of
    course British.

19.  In  respect  of  making  an  entry  clearance  application  from   the
    Philippines, on the evidence I do have (which I will accept is reliable
    as of July of 2015), an approximate waiting time for applications  made
    would be between 60 and 120 working days.  There  would  of  course  be
    expenses incurred in  the  Appellant  having  to  travel  back  to  the
    country, stay there pending the outcome  of  the  application,  and  to
    return to this country.  These expenses have  not  been  quantified  in
    evidence before me; nonetheless they would be fairly significant.   The
    cost would in all likelihood fall upon the shoulders of the sponsor The
    sponsor earns over �23,000 a year. His accommodation as far  as  I  can
    see comes with employment and incurs no extra cost.  I am not aware  of
    the financial circumstances of the sponsor's son, and it may be that he
    is dependent on large part upon his father.   Notwithstanding this,  it
    is more probable than not that the sponsor would  be  able  to  provide
    sufficient  finances  to  enable  the  Appellant  to  return   to   the
    Philippines, make the application, stay there for anything  up  to  120
    days and to travel back to this country if  and  when  the  appropriate
    entry clearance is granted.  I appreciate that it might be a  financial
    struggle, but there is no evidence before me  to  suggest  that  it  is
    simply not a realistic proposition.



Conclusions

20. The test of whether there are insurmountable obstacles is  a  high  one
    (see paragraph 21 of Agyarko and of course what is said in EX.2).

21. Having regard to my findings of fact, above, I conclude that there  are
    no insurmountable obstacles to the Appellant and the sponsor continuing
    their family life in the Philippines.

22. In the circumstances, establishing a  life  there  would  no  doubt  be
    difficult; there would be very real obstacles in their path and it  may
    well be that I would regard it as  being  unreasonable.  However,  this
    does  not  mean  that  the  obstacles  would  be  insurmountable.   The
    sponsor's nationality is not in and  of  itself  a  factor  that  would
    render relocation sufficiently difficult to meet the test. There are no
    health issues in this case. There are family members of  the  Appellant
    in the Philippines who would on my findings be able to provide at least
    some assistance, perhaps in the early stages of return  in  order  that
    the couple could find work and adjust to the  situation.   It  is  true
    that there would be linguistic difficulties for the sponsor. However in
    my view there is nothing preventing him from learning the  language  at
    least to an acceptable level sooner rather  than  later.  Although  the
    Appellant herself has been away from the country for some time now, she
    grew up there, spent most of her life in that  country  and  it  cannot
    realistically be said that she will not be aware of the cultural norms.



23. It may well be difficult to find employment but between the two of them
    I conclude that the prospects are reasonable. This  would  include  the
    scenario in which perhaps only one of them found  employment  initially
    whilst the other sought to  improve  their  prospects  in  due  course.
    There is no evidence to suggest that the sponsor would not be  admitted
    to the country as the husband of a Pilipino national.

24. I have had regard of course to the situation of the sponsor's son.   He
    would in effect be left in this country  without  his  father  and  his
    stepmother and that would be difficult for him. However he is a twenty-
    two year old adult who has now completed a degree and  is  forging  his
    way on in life.  I have no evidence to suggest that he simply would not
    be able to cope with life here alone both  in  respect  of  any  health
    issues, employment or emotional needs.  On this basis the appeal  fails
    in respect of the Rules.

25. I turn to consider the Article 8 claim outside of the Rules.  There  is
    nothing compelling in this case which  would  allow  the  Appellant  to
    succeed in respect of the argument that the couple could not go to live
    in the Philippines together.

26. I turn  to  the  alternative  submission  that  even  making  an  entry
    clearance application from abroad would be disproportionate. I conclude
    that an entry clearance  application  from  the  Philippines  would  be
    highly likely to  succeed.  It  is  right  also  that  the  Appellant's
    immigration history is not as poor as some that the Tribunal sees.  She
    has at least attempted to try and regularise her status over the course
    of a number of years now.  Having said that the inescapable  fact  that
    she has been  here  unlawfully  through  almost  the  entirety  of  her
    residence in the United Kingdom her relationship with her  husband  has
    been carried on in the full knowledge of both parties that she  may  be
    removed from this country at any time.  There was no  expectation  that
    she would be  able  to  remain.   The  sponsor  must  have  known  this
    throughout.  In my view the consequences of a temporary  separation  of
    the couple whilst she returned to the  Philippines  to  make  an  entry
    clearance application would not entail such serious consequences as  to
    render that possibility disproportionate.  I have  had  regard  to  the
    case of Chen which makes it clear that it is not simply a  question  of
    whether an entry clearance application would be  successful,  but  also
    whether there is evidence to show that  a  temporary  separation  would
    entail very serious consequences.  That statement of the correct  legal
    approach is supported in my  view  by  what  is  said  in  Agyarko,  in
    particular at paragraph 31 in which Lord Justice Sales comments that:

         "It is possible to envisage a Chikwamba type case arising in  which
         Article 8 might require that leave to remain be granted outside the
         Rules  even  though  it  could  not  be  said   that   there   were
         insurmountable obstacles to  the  applicant  and  their  spouse  or
         partner continuing  their  family  life  overseas  but  in  a  case
         involving precarious family life it would be necessary to establish
         that  there  were  exceptional  circumstances  to  warrant  such  a
         conclusion".

27. In the present case the family life is clearly  precarious  within  the
    meaning of section 117B(4) of the 2002 Act  and  the  decision  of  the
    Court of Appeal in Rhuppiah.  The Appellant has failed to  satisfy  the
    Rules as they relate to Article 8, and on the facts  as  I  have  found
    them to be there simply are in my view  no  compelling  or  exceptional
    circumstances which could avail the Appellant given the high thresholds
    set down by the law as it currently stands.

28. I have taken into account that the Appellant's ability to speak English
    and her financial support from her husband. These matters,  whilst  not
    counting against her are of neutral effect.  In light of the above  the
    Appellant's appeal fails on this basis as well.

Notice of Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

I re-make the decision by dismissing the appeal on human rights grounds.

No anonymity direction is made.

For the Respondent:    Ms A Bailey-Perkins, Counsel, instructed by
Synthesis Chambers


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State (hereafter the  Respondent)
    against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Malcolm (the  judge),
    promulgated on 17 December 2015, in which he allowed the appeal of  Mrs
    Sanchez (hereafter the Appellant) on human rights grounds.  That appeal
    arose from a decision of the Respondent, dated  20  February  2015,  in
    which her human rights claim was refused and directions were given  for
    her removal under section 10 of the Immigration and Asylum  Act,  1999.
    The human rights claim was refused on the basis that Appendix FM to the
    Immigration Rules could not be satisfied.  This  in  turn  was  on  the
    grounds that EX.1 and EX.2 of Appendix FM could not  be  met.   It  was
    concluded that the Appellant and her British citizen husband (with whom
    it was accepted she had a genuine and  subsisting  relationship)  could
    continue their family life outside of the United Kingdom.  It was  also
    concluded that paragraph 276ADE of the Rules was not satisfied.




The judge's decision

 2. A claim had been made that the Appellant satisfied the  surviving  long
    residence Rule, as it was said that  she  had  been  residing  in  this
    country since 1996.  The judge rejected this at paragraph 48  and  this
    aspect of his decision has not been challenged.

 3. In respect of Appendix FM and EX.1, the judge states  at  paragraph  50
    that  he  was  required  to  consider  whether  or   not   there   were
    insurmountable obstacles in  family  life  continuing  outside  of  the
    United Kingdom.  At paragraph 51 the judge found  that  the  Appellant,
    her husband and the husband's adult son had established a  very  strong
    family unit, and that the Appellant herself provided emotional  support
    to the son.

 4. I set out paragraph 52 in full:

         "Whilst it would be possible for the Appellant and her  husband  to
         move to the Philippines I considered that this was not a reasonable
         option for the Appellant's husband and considered that there  would
         be difficulties if this route  was  followed.   I  considered  that
         there could indeed be serious hardship for the  Appellant  and  her
         husband if required to move to the Philippines."

 5. At paragraph 53 the judge concludes that the requirements of  paragraph
    276ADE(1)(vi) were not satisfied.  This conclusion  too  has  not  been
    challenged by way of a cross appeal.

 6. At paragraph 56 the judge states that if the Appellant had to return to
    the Philippines alone and applied for entry clearance  her  application
    would be successful: in this  regard  the  judge  states  that  he  had
    considered the case of  Chikwamba.   He  concludes  that  paragraph  by
    stating  that  there  were,  "a  number  of  factors  resting  on   the
    Appellant's side of the balance".  As a result  of  his  considerations
    the judge purports to allow the appeal "on human rights grounds".




The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

 7. The grounds of appeal assert that the judge misdirected himself  as  to
    the applicable tests under EX.1 and EX.2 of Appendix FM with regard  to
    the Court of Appeal's decision in Agyarko & Others [2015] EWCA Civ 440.
     It is also said that the judge failed  to  deal  adequately  with  the
    Chikwamba point by not having regard to the guidance  provided  in  the
    decision of R (on the application of Chen) (Appendix FM -  Chikwamba  -
    temporary separation - proportionality) IJR [2015] UKUT 00189 .

 8. Finally, it is said that in considering the Article 8 claim outside  of
    the Rules the judge failed to have any or any adequate  regard  to  the
    mandatory factors in section 117B of the Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002.   Permission  to  appeal  was  granted  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge P J M Hollingworth on 8 July 2016.




The hearing before me

 9. Mr Kotas submitted that in paragraph 52 of his decision the  judge  had
    simply used the wrong terminology.  This was also a matter of substance
    because it was apparent from the words used that he had in fact applied
    too low a threshold in respect of EX.1 and EX.2.  Insofar as the  judge
    purported to allow the appeal on  Article  8  grounds  outside  of  the
    Rules, Mr Kotas submitted  that  there  was  nothing  in  substance  in
    relation to section 117B of the 2002 Act: what is said in paragraph  55
    was insufficient, and there was a failure to factor in the  point  that
    the Appellant had failed to satisfy the 'Article 8 Rules'.

10. For the  Appellant,  Ms  Bailey-Perkins  submitted  that  all  relevant
    evidence and submissions had been made to the judge at  the  First-tier
    Tribunal hearing.  A detailed skeleton argument had  been  before  him.
    She acknowledged that it was somewhat unfortunate that not all of these
    points had appeared in his decision.  Nonetheless she submitted that he
    had properly allowed the appeal on Article 8  grounds  outside  of  the
    Rules.




My decision on error of law

11. I find that there are material errors of law in the judge's decision.

12. First, although it is unclear from the wording adopted by the judge  at
    the end of his decision, I deem it appropriate to look initially at his
    consideration under Appendix FM with  particular  regard  to  EX.1  and
    EX.2.  It seems to me  having  regard  to  paragraph  52  that  he  was
    purporting to find that the relevant provisions had in fact been met by
    the Appellant.  However, in doing so he has misdirected himself in  law
    as to the applicable test.

13. Whilst it is true that reference is made in paragraph 52 to the  phrase
    "serious hardship", he also speaks of a move to the Philippines by  the
    Appellant's husband as not being a "reasonable" option and there  being
    "difficulties" in this.  This terminology  is  not  reflective  of  the
    clear guidance set out in Agyarko that  in  looking  at  insurmountable
    obstacles  the  threshold  is  significantly  higher  than  that  of  a
    reasonableness test.  In my view the judge has in fact applied too  low
    a threshold and in doing so has made an error of law.  It  is  material
    to the extent that the judge has seemingly  found  that  the  Appellant
    satisfied the requirements of the Rules.

14.  I  go  on  to  consider  the  decision  in  respect  of  the   judge's
    consideration of Article 8 outside of the Rules.  I conclude  that  the
    judge has simply failed to consider all relevant matters in respect  of
    the freestanding proportionality exercise.  In particular there  is  no
    reference to section 117B of the 2002  Act.   That  of  course  is  not
    necessarily fatal to the decision.

15. However, I also find that there is nothing  of  substance  to  indicate
    that the relevant mandatory factors have been considered adequately, or
    indeed at all.  There is no specific reference to the  public  interest
    in maintaining effective  immigration  control.   This  was  clearly  a
    highly relevant matter given the Appellant's complete lack of status in
    this country.  There is no reference to the  fact  that  the  Appellant
    failed to satisfy the Rules, as they relate to  Article  8.   Decisions
    such as Haleemudeen [2014] EWCA Civ 558 and SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA  Civ
    387 make it clear that a failure to meet the Rules must be  a  relevant
    factor when looking at Article 8 cases outside of the Rules.  There  is
    no consideration of financial  independence  or  the  English  language
    ability.

16. Paragraph 55 in my  view  is  inadequate  in  respect  of  the  overall
    exercise the judge was required to undertake.  There  is  reference  to
    the precarious immigration status but there is nothing to indicate that
    as a result of this the judge has materially reduced the weight  placed
    upon the family life as a result of this.  To this extent  the  judge's
    decision is materially flawed.

17. Finally, in respect of the  Chikwamba  point,  there  are  in  fact  no
    specific findings by the judge as to the Appellant's  ability  to  meet
    the  Rules  if  an  entry  clearance  application  was  made  from  the
    Philippines.  In particular, there is no consideration of the financial
    evidence which was apparently before him.  In  addition,  there  is  no
    engagement with the guidance in Chen as to why a  temporary  separation
    of the Appellant from her  husband  would  result  in  disproportionate
    consequences for that limited period.  This is another  material  error
    of law.

18. For all the above reasons I set aside the judge's decision.




Disposal

19. Mr Kotas confirmed that there had been and was no real challenge to the
    credibility of the Appellant's  evidence  in  this  case.   Ms  Bailey-
    Perkins confirmed to me that aside from  the  simple  passage  of  time
    between the First-tier hearing and the hearing before me there had  not
    been a material change in circumstances in the  Appellant's  case.   In
    light of this it seems to me that the matter should be retained in  the
    Upper Tribunal.

20. I am adjourning the case for a resumed hearing to be heard before me on
    5 October 2016.  The reason I cannot proceed to  re-make  the  decision
    now is that I have not had sight of any  of  the  Appellant's  evidence
    before the First-tier Tribunal (this is not the fault of the  Appellant
    or  her  representatives),  and  that  further  findings  of  fact   on
    particular issues may be  necessary  in  due  course.   Therefore,  the
    hearing is adjourned and I issue relevant directions, below.
