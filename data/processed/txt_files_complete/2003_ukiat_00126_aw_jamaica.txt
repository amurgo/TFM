Miss M Bhamra, of Counsel, instructed  by  Community  &  Immigration  Rights
Centre, appeared on behalf of the appellant and Mr L Parker, a  Senior  Home
Office Presenting Officer, appeared on behalf of the respondent.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.     The  appellant,  a  citizen   of   Jamaica,   appeals   against   the
      determination of an Adjudicator,  Mr  B  H  Forster  OBE,  who,  in  a
      determination promulgated on 4 March 2003, following a hearing  on  24
      February 2003 at Newport County Court, dismissed  her  appeal  against
      the decision of the respondent, taken on 1 February 2001, to refuse to
      vary leave to remain in the United Kingdom.

2.    The appellant was born on 9 August 1990 and she arrived in the  United
      Kingdom as a visitor on 11 June 1999, when she was  granted  leave  to
      enter on that basis for a period of six months.   She  is  now  twelve
      years old.

3.    On 11 November 1999, Community & Immigration Rights Centre applied  on
      behalf of the appellant for indefinite leave to remain in  the  United
      Kingdom as a dependant relative of her great uncle,  Arthur  Campbell,
      ("the sponsor"), a British citizen present and settled in  the  United
      Kingdom.  The relevant immigration rule is contained at paragraph  298
      of HC 395.

4.    On 1 February 2001, the respondent refused  to  vary  the  appellant's
      leave in accordance with paragraph 30 and with reference to  paragraph
      298(1)(d) of HC 395.  The respondent noted that the appellant's  close
      relatives in her own country included her mother and father, whom  the
      appellant's  representatives  claimed  were  unable  to  maintain  the
      appellant.  The respondent was of the view that there  was  no  reason
      why the sponsor could not continue to support the appellant, were  she
      to be returned to Jamaica, having been responsible for  her  financial
      support, according  to  the  application,  prior  to  the  appellant's
      arrival in the United Kingdom.  The respondent was  not  satisfied  on
      the basis of documentary evidence and information received, that  both
      the appellant's parents were settled in the United  Kingdom,  or  that
      the appellant's great uncle had previously had sole responsibility for
      the appellant's upbringing, or that there were serious and  compelling
      family or other considerations which made  the  appellant's  exclusion
      from the United Kingdom undesirable.  He concluded that the  appellant
      could not meet the requirements of the immigration rules  relating  to
      indefinite leave to remain as a child related to a person present  and
      settled in the United Kingdom and he refused her application.

5.    Following the respondent's decision, a notice of appeal was lodged  on
      behalf of the appellant on 7 February 2001, when the  application  was
      reconsidered by the  respondent,  who  maintained  his  refusal.   The
      appellant  had  raised  a  claim  under  Article  8  of  the  European
      Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental  Freedoms
      ("ECHR"), but on the basis of the documentary evidence  received,  the
      Secretary of State was not satisfied that  there  were  "any  concerns
      sufficiently serious to engage Article 8 in the  appellant's  case  as
      both parents were in Jamaica."

6.    In his determination, the Adjudicator found that the circumstances  of
      the appellant's family home in Jamaica,  while  being  less  desirable
      than those of the appellant's great uncle and his wife,  were  not  so
      poor as to amount to conditions which would make  the  return  of  the
      appellant undesirable.  In considering the appellant's Article 8 claim
      he said:


           "In the light of the fact that the appellant's  mother  and  the
           bulk of her family is in Jamaica, then although her  removal  to
           Jamaica would amount to an interference with the family life she
           has established with her sponsor and  his  wife  in  the  United
           Kingdom, that interference would be in pursuit of  a  legitimate
           aim, namely immigration control and taken in accordance with the
           law and I find that the interference with her Article  8  rights
           is proportionate to that aim for the same reasons that ground my
           view of her position under the Rules."


7.    In the (quite unnecessarily long) grounds of application for leave  to
      appeal, it was submitted that the Adjudicator had  not  considered  in
      detail all the evidence given  by  the  appellant's  great  uncle  and
      evidence submitted on behalf of the appellant from her school and  her
      church.  Had he done so he would have found that  there  were  serious
      and  compelling  family  or  other  considerations,  which  make   the
      appellant's  exclusion  undesirable.   They  also  assert   that   the
      Adjudicator erred in law  in  his  consideration  of  the  appellant's
      Article 8 claim and the effect of removal on the  physical  and  moral
      integrity of the appellant.

8.    Addressing us on behalf of the appellant, Ms  Bhamra pointed out  that
      the Adjudicator heard a great deal of evidence that was not previously
      considered by the Secretary of State.  Since arriving  in  the  United
      Kingdom in 1999, the appellant has lived with her great uncle and  his
      wife.  Neither of the appellant's parents take any real  role  in  the
      appellant's life.  The appellant's mother is  herself  wholly  reliant
      financially on her own father, the sponsor's brother.  The appellant's
      own mother lives with her mother and father, four of her siblings  and
      with the appellant's two younger  siblings.   They  live  in  a  three
      bedroom house  in  cramped  and  unsatisfactory  conditions.   Counsel
      submitted that there were  serious  and  compelling  family  or  other
      considerations  making  the  appellant's  exclusion  from  the  United
      Kingdom undesirable.  The appellant was entitled  to  succeed  in  her
      appeal against the refusal of the respondent to grant  her  indefinite
      leave to remain under paragraph 298 of HC 395.  She submitted that the
      Adjudicator's decision was unsustainable.

9.     Counsel  drew  the  Tribunal's  attention  to  paragraph  26  of  the
      Adjudicator's determination.  She reminded  us  that  the  Adjudicator
      accepted the evidence of the sponsor, in relation to the conditions in
      Jamaica to which the appellant would be  returning.   The  appellant's
      family members in Jamaica are not able  to  feed  themselves  and  the
      sponsor regularly sends them money.  He last sent  money  in  December
      2002.

10.   Turning to the appellant's Article 8 claim, the Adjudicator failed  to
      consider in the balancing exercise  the  conditions  under  which  the
      appellant lived in the United Kingdom.  Within  his  consideration  in
      paragraph 27 of his  determination,  the  Adjudicator  has  failed  to
      consider the impact which removal would have on such  a  young  child.
      He does not demonstrate that he has considered the  inevitable  change
      to  the  appellant's  emotionally  stability,  which  would  occur  by
      removal.

11.   The Tribunal asked Counsel to clarify whether, under  the  immigration
      rules,  the  Adjudicator  should  have  concerned  himself  with   the
      conditions in the appellant's own country rather than those which  the
      appellant enjoyed in the United Kingdom.   Counsel  was  not  able  to
      assist.  She invited the Tribunal  to  either  remit  the  appeal  for
      hearing afresh or, in the alternative, to allow the appeal.

12.   For the respondent, Mr Parker confirmed that the Adjudicator was  only
      concerned,  in  his  consideration  of  the  appellant's  claim  under
      paragraph 298(d) of HC 395, with the circumstances in the  appellant's
      own country.  In relation to the appellant's claim  under  Article  8,
      both the appellant's situation prevailing in the  United  Kingdom  and
      the conditions to which she will  be  required  to  return  should  be
      considered.

13.   Mr Parker submitted that the question of whether or  not,  "  ...there
      are serious and compelling family or other considerations  which  make
      exclusion  of  the  [appellant]  undesirable..."  had  been   properly
      considered by the  Adjudicator,  but  this  appellant  had  failed  to
      demonstrate that there were any such considerations.  There were  many
      children living at, or close to the poverty line throughout the  world
      and there is nothing in the evidence before the Adjudicator to suggest
      that conditions to which the appellant would return  in  Jamaica  were
      serious and compelling.  Her family in Jamaica were living just  above
      the poverty line.  Viewed cumulatively, the evidence of the conditions
      in which the appellant would live, do not meet  the  requirements  set
      out in paragraph 298 of HC395.  He suggested that were the sponsor not
      supporting the family as he had done, then it was possible that  those
      conditions might be met.  He submitted that the  correct  approach  in
      respect of the appellant's Article 8 claim was to look at the  balance
      between the conditions prevailing  in  Jamaica  and  those  which  the
      appellant enjoyed in the United Kingdom.

14.   As to the appellant's Article 8 claim, Mr  Parker  submitted  that  it
      was necessary to bear in mind that the appellant was granted leave  as
      a visitor, when in fact the intention of  the  sponsor  was  that  the
      appellant should settle in the United Kingdom.   That,  he  submitted,
      breaches   paragraph   322(2),   namely,   "the   making   of    false
      representations or the failure to disclose any material fact  for  the
      purpose of obtaining leave to enter or a previous variation of leave."
       That, he urged us,  must  be  a  consideration.   He  suggested  that
      culpability must attach to the appellant, because the sponsor  was  in
      loco  parenthesis.   After  some  discussion  with  the  Tribunal,  he
      conceded that this point could not be right, given that the  appellant
      is now only aged twelve and was only eight years of age  at  the  time
      she entered the United Kingdom.

15.   Mr Parker accepted that there was a fifteen month delay  on  the  part
      of the Secretary of State in  considering  the  application  and  that
      there was a further unacceptable delay on the part of  the  respondent
      following the giving of the notice of appeal, in  sending  the  appeal
      papers to the Immigration Appellate Authority.

16.   He conceded that the Adjudicator's determination was  not  sustainable
      in relation to  the  appellant's  claim  under  Article  8  since  the
      Adjudicator had not demonstrated that he had considered  properly  the
      question of whether removal was proportionate.  However, he  suggested
      that the Adjudicator had made clear findings of fact and on that basis
      the Tribunal could correct the error.   He  invited  the  Tribunal  to
      dismiss the appeal.

17.   Responding, Counsel accepted that there was  no  evidence  before  the
      Adjudicator which he has not properly recorded in  his  determination.
      We reserved our determination.

18.   We first considered the appellant's appeal in  respect  of  her  claim
      for indefinite leave  to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  under  the
      requirements of paragraph 298 of HC 395.

19.   Paragraph 298 provides as follows:

           "298. The requirements to be met by a person seeking  indefinite
                 leave to remain in the United Kingdom as  the  child  of  a
                 parent, parents or a relative present and  settled  in  the
                 United Kingdom are that he:


                 i)    is seeking to remain with  a  parent,  parents  or  a
                 relative in one of the following circumstances:


                       a)    ....


                       b)    ....


                       c)    .... or


                       d)    one parent or a relative is present and settled
                       in the United  Kingdom  and  there  are  serious  and
                       compelling family or other considerations which  make
                       exclusion  of  the  child  undesirable  and  suitable
                       arrangements have been made for the child's care; and


                 ii)   ....


                 iii)  ....


                 iv)   ....


                 v)    ...."




20.   We are grateful to Counsel for  having  accepted  that  there  was  no
      evidence before the Adjudicator, which he  has  not  recorded  in  his
      determination.  The evidence before the appellant in relation  to  the
      circumstances in Jamaica are set out in paragraphs 12 and  13  of  the
      Adjudicator's determination.  He said:

           12.   [the sponsor] said that since 1961 when  he  came  to  the
                 United Kingdom, he had been back to  Jamaica  five  or  six
                 times - the last occasion in 1999 - to  visit  his  brother
                 and had been struck by the appalling conditions.  There was
                 overcrowding with nine people in the  three  bedroom  house
                 and the appellant and her  mother  and  an  adult  and  two
                 sisters all shared two beds in the same room, sleeping "top
                 to toe".  The appellant was unable to  go  to  school  more
                 than two to three times a week because the fares could  not
                 be afforded.  She was thin  and  undernourished.   He  said
                 that the farming which provided their  livelihood  was  not
                 really paying and everything had virtually come to a  stop.
                   It was only a smallholding and  with  the  droughts  some
                 years and too much rain  others,  they  often  lost  crops.
                 When the crops did succeed, so  did  everybody  else's  and
                 there was too much produce and  no  profit.   When  he  was
                 there, there was not a lot to eat and there was no meat  or
                 fish and the appellant ate  yams,  banana,  breadfruit  and
                 whatever else she could find.  She was very thin, but still
                 lively.  She did not cry at all. The sponsor's brother  was
                 the breadwinner in the house and  the  farm  was  the  only
                 source of income.  The appellant's mother worked by way  of
                 washing and cooking in the house and could not maintain the
                 appellant properly on her own, having no income.  They  had
                 brought the  appellant  to  this  country  because  of  the
                 appalling conditions there and because they could give  her
                 such a better life here.  They treated  her  as  their  own
                 child and when she had any problems of the sort  afflicting
                 young women, she could turn to his wife or to his daughters
                 aged 33 and 34, although the latter no  longer  lived  with
                 the sponsor.  She called his wife "auntie".


           13.   The sponsor said that there was no one else to  take  care
                 of the appellant and if she returned to Jamaica  she  would
                 be devastated.  School there was a poor proposition and the
                 teaching here was much better.  She would not  be  able  to
                 afford to go to school every day back in  Jamaica  and  she
                 would not get such good food and would  lose  weight.   She
                 would also lose the emotional support of the sponsor's wife
                 and daughters."


21.   The Adjudicator noted that the appellant got on well with  her  mother
      and that the sponsor and his wife had chosen the  appellant  to  bring
      with them, because she was the oldest.  The sponsor confirmed that the
      appellant telephoned her mother regularly, but nonetheless came to him
      and his wife with her problems.  The appellant's father played no role
      in the proceedings and was not supporting them,  or  living  with  the
      appellant's mother, who was now in her early thirties.

22.   The Adjudicator correctly identified that the  sole  matter  requiring
      his decision was in relation to the decision taken by the Secretary of
      State, that there were no  serious  and  compelling  family  or  other
      considerations making exclusion  of  the  appellant  undesirable.   In
      paragraph 24 of his determination he said:-

           "It is abundantly clear that the appellant enjoys a  far  better
           standard of life in the United Kingdom with her great uncle than
           she would back  home  in  Jamaica  with  her  mother  and  other
           relatives.  The accommodation is more spacious,  there  is  more
           money and better food and the appellant is now  able  to  attend
           her school five days a week.  It is quite clear that  she  is  a
           model pupil, well thought of by her tutors and  that  she  is  a
           conscientious student and also a member of her local church.  In
           Jamaica the family position is much more  precarious,  standards
           of living  are  considerably  lower  and  not  only  do  I  have
           considerable sympathy with the view  taken  by  the  appellant's
           sponsor, it clearly does him great credit that he is prepared to
           offer the appellant a supportive and loving home in this country
           in order, at the very  least,  that  she  might  have  a  better
           standard of living and education."


23.   The Adjudicator considered the position of the family in Jamaica  and,
      while noting that they were patently less desirable than those of  the
      sponsor and his wife and it was  certainly  true  that  the  appellant
      would enjoy a much better standard of  living,  health  and  education
      were she to remain in the United Kingdom, he found  that  he  was  not
      satisfied  that  if  returned  to  Jamaica  the  physical  and  social
      conditions in which she would find herself would be such as to  amount
      to "serious and compelling family or other considerations  making  her
      exclusion undesirable."  He found that the conditions in Jamaica  were
      clearly not as good as they are in the United Kingdom, but  that  they
      were not so poor, in his opinion, and on the evidence which was placed
      before him, as to satisfy the requirements of paragraph 298.

24.   Included within the bundle submitted on behalf of the  appellant,  was
      a statement signed by the  sponsor  in  which  he  confirmed  that  he
      regularly sends money to his brother, the appellant's grandfather,  to
      maintain him and his family and there was also  included  a  "Victoria
      Link Money Transfer" form dated 20 September 2002  showing  that  the
      sponsor's wife had remitted the sum of �60  and  a  further  "Victoria
      Link Money Transfer" form showing that on 18 December 2002 the sponsor
      had remitted a further �160.

25.   We carefully considered the circumstances in which the  appellant  had
      been living in Jamaica, as set out in some detail by  the  Adjudicator
      at paragraph 12.

26.   We find  ourselves  unable  to  agree  with  Counsel  that  there  was
      sufficient evidence before the Adjudicator to establish that there are
      serious and compelling family and other considerations such as to make
      the exclusion of the appellant from the  United  Kingdom  undesirable.
      We therefore uphold the decision of the  Adjudicator  in  relation  to
      this aspect of the appellant's appeal.

27.   We now turn  to  the  appellant's  claim  under  Article  8.   As  the
      Tribunal have said  on  numerous  occasions  previously,  the  correct
      approach is to adopt that used by the European Court  and  to  analyse
      the claim, using a logical step-by-step approach.  First  it  must  be
      asked whether there is an existent private or family life?  Second  it
      needs to be considered whether there will be an interference with that
      family or private life?   Third,  it  must  be  decided  whether  that
      interference pursues a legitimate aim, and if it does, fourth, whether
      it is in accordance with the law?  Finally it must be decided  whether
      such interference is proportionate?

28.   In answer to the first question, we  find,  as  did  the  Adjudicator,
      that the appellant does enjoy a family life with the sponsor  and  his
      wife, with whom she has  lived  since  her  admission  to  the  United
      Kingdom.  It follows, therefore, that removal of  the  appellant  will
      amount to an interference with it.  Such interference  does  pursue  a
      legitimate aim and it has not been argued before us that it would  not
      be in accordance with the law.  The  question  for  us  to  decide  is
      whether such interference is proportionate?

29.   The Adjudicator had before  him  a  statement  from  the  sponsor  and
      letters of support from the appellant's church and school.  We have  a
      letter from the Rev. Audrey Standhaft in which she confirms  that  the
      appellant is a regular attendee at Sunday Worship and at  the  Parkway
      Methodist Church mid-week youth club.  She is  described  as  being  a
      reliable, trustworthy and helpful young lady.  The  appellant's  tutor
      from St. Thomas Moore School describes the appellant as keen pupil  of
      average ability who always works to the best of that ability.  She  is
      well behaved and polite, both in the classroom and around the  school.
      She is friendly, caring and enthusiastic about  everything  she  does.
      She punctually completes her homework and  is  described  as  being  a
      "delightful member of the tutor group" and always willing to volunteer
      for tasks and be helpful in any way she can.  She is popular with  her
      peers and teachers and  takes  a  keen  interest  in  extra-curricular
      activities and sings with the  choir.   She  is  a  keen  athlete  and
      competes on behalf of the school.  Her tutor describes her as being  a
      very likeable mature  girl  who  is  an  asset  to  the  school.   The
      appellant has been awarded an attendance award for perfect  attendance
      during the academic year September 2000 to July 2001.   She  has  been
      awarded nine commendations since December 2002 by her  school,  which,
      in the words of the Head Teacher,  "reflect  a  positive  attitude  to
      school life".  A charitable company  providing  arts  and  performance
      tuition for young people, Multi A Ltd., have presented  the  appellant
      with a Certificate of Achievement  for  outstanding  contribution  and
      performance.  It is quite clear to the Tribunal that  the  appellant's
      sponsor and his wife are to be congratulated for the way in which they
      have been caring for the appellant.

30.   Mr Parker asked us to bear in mind that  it  appears  to  have  always
      been the sponsor's intention to bring  the  appellant  to  the  United
      Kingdom for settlement.  That is a matter that we  believe  we  should
      have regard to; there was a  deliberate  attempt  by  the  sponsor  to
      circumvent immigration control.  We reminded ourselves that, when  the
      appellant entered the United Kingdom, she was eight years old and that
      the delay in processing her application for indefinite leave,  coupled
      with the delay on the part of the respondent in forwarding her  appeal
      to the Immigration Appellate Authorities, has resulted in  her  having
      spent some four years in the United Kingdom.  During these four  years
      she has made excellent progress in her education, assisted no doubt by
      the undoubted love and care lavished on her by  the  sponsor  and  his
      wife.   We take into account the fact that this four year  period  has
      been a crucial time in her development and that the appellant has come
      to regard her great uncle and aunt as substitute parents.  We  do  not
      underestimate the emotional trauma which she will  undoubtedly  suffer
      as a result of being required to leave the United Kingdom.

31.    Nevertheless,  this  appeal  does  not  in   our   view   raise   the
      considerations as to the effect of delay on the part of the  Secretary
      of State which applied in Shala v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
      Department [2003] EWCA Civ 233, where the claimant  had  a  legitimate
      claim to enter.  In the present appeal, although entry was  lawful  in
      the sense that entry clearance as a visitor had  been  obtained,  that
      was not the real purpose of entry, as we have noted above.  The delays
      on the part of the respondent have not  altered  the  outcome  of  the
      appeal under the Immigration Rules, or caused the appellant  to  alter
      her position to her detriment.  The Secretary of State has reached his
      decision on the human rights claim in the knowledge of the appellant's
      circumstances in this country and the passage of time has not  changed
      their essential nature.  We bear in mind the area of discretion  which
      is, as held in Blessings Edore v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
      Department [2003] EWCA Civ 716, to be accorded  to  the  Secretary  of
      State in making his decision, as to the  proportionality  of  removal.
      We cannot say that he is planly wrong in the  decision  which  he  has
      reached.

32.   We bear  in  mind  that  the  sponsor  and  his  wife  have  regularly
      supported the appellant's  family  in  Jamaica  financially  and  they
      continue to do so.  There is no evidence before us  to  suggest  that,
      were the appellant to be required to leave  the  United  Kingdom,  she
      would not continue to enjoy financial support from the sponsor and his
      wife.

33.   Taking all these factors into account and looking  at  the  matter  in
      the round,  we  are  of  the  view  that  the  interference  with  the
      appellant's Article 8 rights is, in  the  particular  circumstance  of
      this case, proportionate.   For  all  these  reasons  this  appeal  is
      dismissed.
