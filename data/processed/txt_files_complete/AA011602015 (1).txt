Representation:

For the appellant:     Mr A Jafar, instructed by Liyon Legal Ltd
For the respondent:    Mr S Kotas, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Kevin Rukshan Anthony,  date  of  birth  10.5.82,  is  a
    citizen of Sri Lanka.

 2. This is his appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Greasley promulgated 17.9.15, dismissing  on  all  grounds  his  appeal
    against  the  decision  of  the  respondent  to  refuse   his   asylum,
    humanitarian protection and human rights claims.  The Judge  heard  the
    appeal on 9.9.15.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Nicholson granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    20.10.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 8.1.16 as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.



Error of Law

 5. At the conclusion of the error of law hearing I reserved  my  decision,
    which I now give.

 6. I find that there was no material error of law in  the  making  of  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal such as to require the decision  of
    Judge Greasley to be set aside.

 7. In granting permission to appeal, Judge  Nicholson  found  it  arguable
    that the photocopied bundle submitted to the First-tier Tribunal at the
    appeal hearing, claimed by the appellant and his representative  to  be
    court-certified documents, were 'original' documents  provided  by  the
    court and that they were court-certified. Judge Nicholson noted that it
    is not uncommon in many countries for courts  to  photocopy  a  set  of
    documents, authenticate them with an original stamp and provide them to
    the parties. Judge Nicholson thus found  it  arguable  that  the  judge
    erred in rejecting these documents on the basis that they were  neither
    originals nor court certified.

 8. However, that is  not  a  strictly  accurate  summary  of  the  judge's
    findings at �40 and �47 of the decision. At �40 it is clear  that  this
    'original' bundle was handed in at the appeal hearing and that  it  was
    accepted that these were not original documents, as is obvious from the
    bundle itself, now with the case file. However,  I  can  see  from  the
    bundle that whilst each page is a photocopy  of  some  other  document,
    each page contains a separate purple stamp with a penned signature. The
    translation provided suggests that this stamp, each dated 25 May  2015,
    is a seal of the high  court,  Negombo  and  signed  illegibly  by  the
    Registrar of the High Court. The appellant's only explanation  for  the
    production of these documents was that they had been obtained from  his
    father, who had secured their release through a  lawyer.  There  is  no
    other explanation of their provenance from the court.

 9. Judge Greasley considered these  documents  at  �47  of  the  decision,
    noting first that no original documentation has been produced,  as  was
    accepted by the appellant's representation.  Second,  the  judge  noted
    that  whilst  the  bundle  was  described  as  'court-certified'   that
    description does not appear on the bundle and  was  no  more  than  the
    description provided by the appellant and his representative. The judge
    also accurately noted that each page has a date stamp on it of  25  May
    2015  (wrongly  described  by  the  judge  as  25  May   2010),   "with
    untranslated writing on each stamp, and an un-translated cover  sheet."
    Strictly speaking, the judge was correct. Whilst there is  a  purported
    translation of the cover sheet, it does not contain  a  translation  of
    all that appears on the 'original' cover  sheet.  Further,  it  follows
    that the signature is untranslated. It is  not  known  who  signed  the
    stamp. It  follows  that  there  was  no  reliable  evidence  that  the
    signature was that of a registrar of any  court,  or  indeed  that  the
    stamp is a genuine stamp of the court. Given the absence of explanation
    of how these documents came to be stamped, and absence of any  evidence
    that the person signing  the  stamp  made  any  comparison  to  genuine
    original documents, the judge was entitled to be somewhat sceptical  as
    to whether these were genuine, 'original' or court-certified copies  of
    such genuine or original documents.

10. Further, it is clear from the decision that the  judge  considered  the
    reliability of these so-called 'original documents in the light of  the
    evidence as a whole, including concerns about the content  and  context
    of the statements contained in the documents, particularly in the light
    of the appellant's evidence that he was aware that  an  arrest  warrant
    had been issued in May 2010.

11. The judge found this evidence "wholly  unsatisfactory,"  a  description
    which I find the judge was entitled  to  apply  and  for  which  cogent
    reasons were given. On the basis of the consideration of this evidence,
    together with other concerns  about  the  contents  and  dates  of  the
    documents,  set  out  at  �48-50,  the  judge  reached  the   following
    conclusion: "Considering the well-know  principles  in  Tanveer  Ahmed,
    given the absence of any original  court  documentation,  I  find  when
    considering the evidence in the round that  the  copy  documentation  I
    have been provided with is  not  credible  and  I  therefore  place  no
    reliance upon it."

12. I find, for the reasons set out  in  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and those elaborated herein, the judge was entitled to  attach
    little or no weight to the purported court documents.

13. First, the bundle itself does  not  claim  on  its  face  to  be  court
    certified. The sum total  of  the  claim  of  authenticity  is  that  a
    photocopied bundle of documents has been date  stamped  with  a  rubber
    stamp and signed illegibly, the  stamp  purporting  to  be  that  of  a
    register of the high court. Judge Greasley was evidently not satisfied,
    and nor am I, that this stamp renders these copy  documents  'original'
    or 'court-certified.' There is no independent evidence that  they  were
    stamped or signed by the high or any other court registrar, who remains
    unidentified, or on what basis they could be certified as accurate some
    5 years or so after alleged creation. The  COI  Report  for  Sri  Lanka
    dated March 2012 at section 27 refers to the ease with which forged and
    fraudulently obtained official documents can be produced in Sri  Lanka,
    explaining that there is such  a  high  level  of  corruption  and  the
    unscrupulous actions of government officials  at  all  levels  that  it
    undermines the issuing process  for  many  official  documents.  It  is
    apparently rare to see forged documents, because genuine documents  are
    so easy to obtain fraudulently. It would, of course,  be  a  relatively
    easy matter to apply a rubber stamp  to  any  documents.  There  is  no
    evidence that even if the stamp was genuinely applied, the person doing
    so had compared the copies being stamped with the originals.

14. I have carefully considered the  supposed  translation  and  note  that
    there are several sections not translated, or  which  are  inaccurately
    translated.  For example,  the  translation  of  the  release  on  bail
    document at A55 purports that  it  has  been  signed  by  a  Magistrate
    (Sign/Mag). However, the so-called original bears  no  such  signature,
    indeed no signature or space for a signature at all. Why (Sign/Mag) was
    added to the translation at all is a mystery.

15. The grounds of appeal refer to the COI Report  at  10.16,  which  state
    that whilst it is common practice to be released on bail without  being
    charged, "there are however certain offences considered unbailable  and
    the Bail Act (No 30 of 1997) stipulates a person suspected  or  accused
    of being concerned  in  committing  or  having  committed,  an  offence
    punishable with death or with life imprisonment, shall not be  released
    on bail except by a Judge of the  High  Court..."  The  grounds  at  �7
    suggest that a high court judge could release someone accused of having
    committed an  offence  punishable  with  death  or  life  imprisonment.
    However, there is no  credible  evidence  that  the  appellant  was  so
    released by a high court judge. It is not clear to me at all that  this
    case was ever before the high court.  The  Warrant  of  Detention,  the
    translation of which appears at A53, lists a number of different courts
    at Negombo "Magistrate's Court/District Court/  High  Court,"  none  of
    which have been indicated. At the end of the translation, the  document
    is said to have been signed by a Magistrate. The  entire  document  has
    not been translated, including, for example, the text that follows  the
    date of 10.1.2010. There are other  anomalies  on  this  document.  For
    example, whilst it is apparently dated 10.1.2010, which is supposed  to
    be the date of commencement of detention, the reverse of the page  also
    has a section with a commencement date of 15.2.10, after the  date  the
    document was purportedly created. It also suggests that  the  detention
    order was cancelled and "produced to the  court.  Bail  out."  If  that
    refers to the release on bail, the document translated at A55  suggests
    that took place on 15.2.10. It is not clear to me that these dates  are
    consistent with the creation of the document.

16. The documents suggest that an arrest warrant was not issued until April
    2011, when the appellant was supposedly bailed to sign on  weekly  from
    22.2.10 (curiously the date in the translation is given the  other  way
    round to all other dates in the translations). The appellant's  account
    is that he used an agent to leave Sri Lanka in June 2010, using his own
    passport. If no arrest warrant had been issued at that time,  it  seems
    unlikely that the authorities would not have been looking for him.

17. Another curiosity in these documents is  that  the  last  page  of  the
    bundle of translated documents, at A56, purports to certify that  these
    are a "True English Translation of the certified  copy  of  the  entire
    Case Record of High Court, Negombo, Case No. B 0137/2010 issued by  the
    Officer-in-Charge, Terrorist Investigation Division, Negombo." One  has
    to query how an independent translator would  know  that  this  is  the
    "entire" case record, and more significantly that  the  case  file  had
    been issued by the officer-in-charge  of  the  Terrorist  Investigation
    Division in Negombo. No such explanation of origin has been provided by
    the appellant, or his father, or his representative. It  is  not  clear
    from where this information has been derived and it is not  clear  that
    such information appears on any of the so-called  'original'  documents
    translated.

18. Judge Greasley also expressed some doubt as to  whether  the  appellant
    would have been bailed because the authorities had  failed  to  provide
    sufficient evidence against the accused, when the documents  themselves
    contain his own confession that for financial reward he helped a  known
    LTTE member to import medicine and weapons from foreign  countries  for
    the benefit of the LTTE. The judge found it not credible that he  would
    have been released on bail in such circumstances. Whether that is right
    or not, it is a factor which the judge was entitled  to  consider  when
    assessing the reliability of the so-called original documents  and  the
    credibility of the appellant's account.

19. In the circumstances, in light of the concerns self-evident on the face
    of these documents and for the reasons set out by Judge  Greasley,  the
    judge was entirely justified in considering the documents in the  round
    in the context of the evidence  as  a  whole,  including  that  of  the
    appellant who claimed that the arrest warrant was issued in  May  2010,
    when the documents suggest a date of 4.4.11. At  �50  the  judge  noted
    that the appellant was asked to explain this discrepancy but was unable
    to do so. I note that the grounds attempt to introduce further evidence
    not placed before the First-tier Tribunal, suggesting the appellant has
    now produced "a  statement  of  truth  explaining  this  mistake,"  and
    suggesting "... it could be possible that the  appellant  was  confused
    about this aspect rather than trying to hide anything about his claim."
    That is mere speculation. The appellant is  simply  trying  to  explain
    away the discrepancy in a manner he was manifestly unable  to  do  when
    questioned about the discrepancy at the appeal hearing.  Such  evidence
    is not admissible when considering whether there was an error of law in
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and to his credit Mr Jafar  did
    not attempt to rely on this post-hearing evidence.

20. I find that none of the above discloses any material error  of  law  in
    the judge's consideration of the documentary evidence  in  the  context
    and light of the appellant's case and evidence as a whole.

21. A further ground of appeal,  which  Judge  Nicholson  suggested  lacked
    merit, is that the  judge  erred  in  considering  the  expert  medical
    evidence. For the reasons set out, I also find no error of law in  this
    regard.

22. Before addressing this ground of appeal, I observe  that  there  is  no
    merit in the related ground of appeal suggesting that the judge reached
    conclusions on credibility without taking  the  medical  evidence  into
    account. It is clear from �42 of the decision that the judge  made  his
    findings only after considering the evidence in its  totality,  looking
    at the evidence in the round  and  taking  into  account  all  relevant
    circumstances, considering discrepancies and taking care to accommodate
    possible reasons for discrepancies. The judge also noted at �44 that he
    was not required to deal expressly with every point, but to demonstrate
    that he has given reasons for his  decision  so  that  parties  to  the
    decision can understand why one has won and the other has lost.

23. In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the judge  made  his  adverse
    credibility findings in the light of the evidence as a whole, including
    the medical evidence.

24. It is clear from the decision that the judge gave anxious  scrutiny  to
    the expert medical evidence. The decision sets out in some detail  from
    �25 a summary of that evidence from Mr Mason, dated 15.6.15. The  judge
    considered not only the scarring but the appellant's  explanation  that
    he had been struck on the face with a rifle butt and later beaten  with
    iron rods, assaulted on three or four occasions to the extent  that  he
    lost consciousness. From �29 the judge summarised Mr Mason's opinion as
    the causation.

25. At �51, as part of his findings, the judge found the report of  limited
    evidential value, noting the  description  of  Mr  Mason  that  various
    injuries "might" have resulted from actions described by the appellant.
    Such descriptions appear inconsistent with the conclusion at 6.2 of the
    report that on the Istanbul Protocol the numerous  scars  were  "highly
    consistent"  with  the  appellant's  claimed  account.  The  judge  was
    entitled to conclude at �51 that the report "is not clear or helpful in
    its assessment as to likely causation of such injuries  to  the  extent
    that I place limited evidential value upon its contentions. Equally, it
    would appear that the  report  has  failed  to  consider  causation  of
    injuries by proxy." In essence, the judge has carefully considered  the
    medical evidence but did not accept that  the  conclusions  of  'highly
    consistent' matched the earlier narrative of examination and  findings,
    giving clear reasons. I note that Mr Jaffar did not address the failure
    of the medical expert to consider self-infliction of injury by proxy, a
    serious shortcoming of the report. In  the  circumstances,  I  find  no
    error of law in the treatment of the medical evidence and  the  grounds
    of appeal in this regard are no  more  than  a  disagreement  with  the
    findings.

26. One issue that may have some force is that at  �54  the  judge  doubted
    that appellant would have been able to  leave  Sri  Lanka  on  his  own
    passport and without difficulty if he had effectively failed to  comply
    with his bail reporting conditions when facing what on any account must
    be regarded as very serious offences. The judge  did  not  mention  the
    country guidance case of GJ, which makes it clear that it  is  possible
    even for persons wanted by the authorities to  leave  Sri  Lanka  using
    their own identity through the airport. On the appellant's  account  at
    the First-tier Tribunal he believed that a warrant had been issued  for
    him in May 2010, before his June  2010  departure.  However,  Mr  Jafar
    suggests that the documents show the warrant was not issued until April
    2011, some 10 months after he left. It is also pointed out that  it  is
    claimed that an agent was used to assist the appellant's departure.

27. An examination of the decision reveals that the judge was  fully  aware
    that it was claimed that an agent had been used. At �23 the judge  also
    noted that the appellant remained indoors  before  departure  from  Sri
    Lanka, except to submit his application to the British High Commission,
    and to collect his visa.

28. However, I find that in  the  context  of  the  findings  as  a  whole,
    particularly as to the appellant's credibility, any error on  the  part
    of the judge to take account of the possibility of the appellant  being
    able to leave Sri Lanka using his own identity, through the services of
    an agent, cannot be more than of marginal relevance to the  outcome  of
    the decision.  The  other  findings  of  fact  supporting  the  adverse
    credibility findings are substantial and  can  stand  independently  of
    this possible error so  that  the  adverse  credibility  conclusion  is
    unassailable.

29. In my view, and for the reasons  set  out  above,  none  of  the  other
    grounds of appeal disclose any material error of law.

Conclusions:

30. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed on all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable in this case and thus there can be no fee award.
