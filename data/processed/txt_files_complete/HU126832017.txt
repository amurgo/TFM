Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr T. Lindsay, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer.
For the Respondent:    Mr M. Symes, instructed by Wilson Solicitors.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This appeal has  a  long  history,  as  its  file  number  shows.   The
    appellant, a national of Jamaica, appealed  against  the  Secretary  of
    State's decision refusing his human  rights  claim  and  maintaining  a
    deportation order which had been made  against  him.   The  appeal  was
    heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Herlihy on 31 July 2018 and she sent
    out her decision, allowing the appeal, on 29 August 2018.

 2. The Secretary of State applied for permission to appeal.  There was  an
    application dated 7 September 2020, nearly two years  after  the  time.
    That application asserted, however, that  a  previous  application  had
    been made, in time, on 10  September  2018,  and  had  apparently  been
    ignored by the Tribunal.  The 2020  application  attached  a  statement
    from the Presenting Officer who had  made  the  2018  application,  and
    continued to rely on the grounds said to have been submitted with it.

 3. The 2020 application came before Judge Rhys-Davies  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  He accepted the statement of  the  Presenting  Officer,  and
    concluded that the application was in time.  His decision was, however,
    that the application should not be admitted, not because it was out  of
    time, but because in his view it was not appropriate to admit it, given
    the respondent's conduct in failing to follow  up  the  application  by
    appropriate, and if necessary persistent, inquiries of the Tribunal.

 4. On receipt of  that  decision,  the  Secretary  of  State  renewed  her
    application for permission, to  this  Tribunal.   The  application  was
    determined by Judge Blundell.  He decided that  Judge  Rhys-Davies  had
    not been entitled to  act  as  he  did.   Having  determined  that  the
    application before him was in time, he needed to decide  whether  there
    was an arguable error of law disclosed by the grounds.  He did  not  at
    that stage have jurisdiction simply not to admit the  application.   In
    view of that conclusion, Judge Blundell thought it  right  to  consider
    again the evidence as to whether the application was in time.   He  too
    concluded that it was.  On consideration of  the  grounds,  he  granted
    permission.

 5. In preparation for the hearing, Counsel  instructed  on  behalf  of  Mr
    McLean, whom we shall call "the claimant", prepared a skeleton argument
    arguing  that  "the  application  for  permission  to  appeal  must  be
    excluded".  Mr Symes, who appeared for the claimant before us, and  who
    had not drafted that skeleton argument, similarly sought to argue  that
    the grant of permission should  be  set  aside.   The  basis  for  that
    application was, essentially, his submission that there was  reason  to
    question the reliability of the statement of the Presenting Officer.

 6. It is convenient to set out  here  the  rules  relating  to  issues  of
    timeliness in relation to applications for permission  to  appeal.   In
    the First-tier Tribunal, rule 33 sets out the time limits for  such  an
    application, and requires that the application "include any application
    for an extension of time and the reasons why such an  extension  should
    be given".  Rule 34 governs the determination of an  application.   The
    options clearly envisaged by  the  rule  are  "to  give  permission  to
    appeal" (Rule 34(2)), and to refuse permission to appeal (Rule  34(4)).
    Only in the latter case are reasons required.   There  is  no  specific
    power to decline the application for permission on the  basis  that  it
    has been received out of time, although it may perhaps be the case that
    such a power can be derived from the requirements relating to time  and
    applications for extension of time.

 7. So far as concerns an application made to the Upper Tribunal,  rule  21
    sets out time limits.  Rule 21(6) provides that an application made out
    of time must be accompanied by a request for an extension of  time  and
    the reason why the application was  not  provided  in  time,  and  that
    "unless the Upper Tribunal extends time for  the  application  ...  the
    Upper Tribunal must not admit the application".

 8. Rule 21(7) is as follows:

         "If the appellant makes an application to the  Upper  Tribunal  for
         permission to appeal against the decision of another tribunal,  and
         that other tribunal refused to admit  the  appellant's  application
         for permission to appeal because the application for permission  or
         for a written statement of reasons was not made in time -

          a) the application to the Upper Tribunal for permission to appeal
             must include the reason  why  the  application  to  the  other
             tribunal for permission to appeal or for a  written  statement
             of reasons, as the case my be, was not made in time; and

          b) the Upper Tribunal must only  admit  the  application  if  the
             Upper Tribunal considers  that  it  is  in  the  interests  of
             justice for it to do so."




 9. It is clear that paragraph (7) applies only in the circumstances  there
    set out, that is to say where the First-tier Tribunal has  (i)  refused
    to admit the application (ii) because it was out  of  time.   Paragraph
    (7) does not apply where either the First-tier Tribunal dealt  with  an
    issue of timeliness by admitting the application and refusing  it;  nor
    does it apply where  the  First-tier  Tribunal  refused  to  admit  the
    application for a reason other than that  it  was  out  of  time.   The
    latter was what happened in this case; and it  follows  that  paragraph
    (7) did not apply to the application for permission to  appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal.  Because paragraph (7) did not apply, the only issue of
    timeliness to be considered by the Upper Tribunal was that  of  whether
    the application to the Upper Tribunal was made within the time  limited
    by the Rules.   In this case it clearly was.

10. It follows from that that Judge Blundell should  not,  we  think,  have
    considered again the question of whether the application to the  First-
    tier Tribunal was made in time.  The First-tier Tribunal's decision was
    not a grant of permission.  There was therefore the right to renew  the
    application for permission to the Upper Tribunal.  The structure of the
    Upper Tribunal's rules is such that only in the  limited  circumstances
    set out in rule 21(7) is the Upper Tribunal concerned in a formal sense
    with the timeliness of the application to the First-tier Tribunal.

11. There remains of course the question  of  whether  the  Upper  Tribunal
    should concern itself with such delay  as  a  substantive  matter  that
    might  cause  it  to  decline  to  exercise  its  discretion  to  grant
    permission to appeal even in a case  where  it  thought  there  was  an
    arguable error of law.  It seems to us that that possibility cannot  be
    ruled out; but we think that circumstances where the facts are so clear
    at the application stage that such a reaction to  them  is  appropriate
    will be rare indeed.

12. Mr Symes's submission was that the Tribunal has power to set aside  its
    grant of permission, and that in the circumstances of the present  case
    it should do so.  As we said at the hearing, we have considerable doubt
    whether the power exists, and under what  circumstances  it  should  be
    exercised.  So far as the present case is  concerned,  the  application
    made to the Upper Tribunal for permission to appeal was made  in  time,
    and, as Judge Blundell's decision indicates, clearly indicated arguable
    errors of law.  Although Judge Blundell did enquire into the timeliness
    of the application to the First-tier Tribunal, that was  not  a  matter
    that was strictly before him.  In any event,  the  conclusion  that  he
    reached on that issue was entirely justifiable on the  evidence  before
    him; and could not by any stretch be regarded as so clearly wrong  that
    he should have considered, instead, whether to refuse permission on the
    arguable grounds because of the history of the applications.

13. We therefore decline to enquire further into, or to interfere with, the
    grant of permission to appeal.  We proceed to consider the Secretary of
    State's grounds of appeal, as argued by Mr Lindsay.

14. As we have said, the claimant is a national of Jamaica.  Some precision
    on the facts of his immigration history is desirable.  He was born on 2
    December 1997.  He came to the United Kingdom with  his  mother  on  30
    June 2002.  Following further grants of leave, he had leave  to  remain
    in the  United  Kingdom  until  31  March  2005.   There  had  been  an
    application for a further grant of leave made on 30 March 2005, that is
    to say within the currency of  existing  leave.   The  application  was
    refused, but there was an appeal against the refusal, which was finally
    determined on 31 August  2005.   By  the  operation  of  s  3C  of  the
    Immigration Act 1971, the claimant's  leave  therefore  expired  on  31
    August 2005, by which time it had run for three years and two months.

15. The claimant's mother made a number of further applications  for  leave
    in the following years.  One of them was  successful.  On  16  February
    2010 the claimant was granted leave  to  remain,  which,  following  an
    extension expired on 30 January 2017, a  total  period  of  six  years,
    eleven months and fourteen days of leave.  The claimant  was  convicted
    on 16 March 2016 and 18 August 2016 of possession  of  heroin,  cocaine
    and cannabis with intent to  supply.   He  was  sentenced  to  eighteen
    months detention in a young offenders' institution.  These were not his
    first offences.  He had been convicted in October  2016  of  possessing
    heroin, and on 16 August 2012 of common assault and  possession  of  an
    offensive  weapon  on  school  premises.   Following  his  most  recent
    conviction,  the  Secretary  of  State  gave   consideration   to   his
    deportation.  After taking into account submissions made on his behalf,
    the Secretary of State  rejected  the  claim  that  his  removal  would
    infringe  article  8.   She  therefore  concluded  that  the   relevant
    provisions of the UK Borders Act 2007 applied to the claimant and  that
    she was required to make a deportation order against  him.   The  order
    was made on 19 January 2017 and communicated  to  the  claimant  on  11
    February 2017 (by which time his leave had  expired)  together  with  a
    notice  of  the  Secretary  of   State's   decision,   which   included
    certification under s 94B of the 2002  Act  that  the  removal  of  the
    claimant from the United Kingdom whilst the appeal  was  pending  would
    not be a breach of his human rights.  The effect  of  that  certificate
    was that that any appeal by the claimant could  be  brought  only  from
    outside the United Kingdom.

16. The  claimant  responded  to  that  with  further  submissions.   Those
    submissions were dealt  with  in  a  decision  made  on  6  June  2017,
    declining to revoke the deportation order and again concluding that the
    claimant's deportation would not breach article 8, but withdrawing  the
    certification.   It  was  against  that  decision  that  the   claimant
    appealed.

17. The grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal were that the claimant
    should not be deported because s 117C of the 2002 Act demonstrated that
    the public interest did not require his deportation.  That  section  is
    as follows:

         "117C.  Article 8: additional  considerations  in  cases  involving
         foreign criminals

                   1) The deportation of foreign criminals is in the public
                      interest.

                   2) The more serious the offence committed by  a  foreign
                      criminal, the  greater  is  the  public  interest  in
                      deportation of the criminal

                   3) In the case of a foreign criminal ('C') who  has  not
                      been sentenced to a period of  imprisonment  of  four
                      years or  more,  the  public  interest  requires  C's
                      deportation  unless  Exception  1  or   Exception   2
                      applies.

                   4) Exception 1 applies where -

                  a) C has been lawfully resident in the United Kingdom for

                                 most of C's life.

                  b) C is socially and culturally integrated in the United

                                 Kingdom, and

                  c) There would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to  C's
                     integration

                                 into the country to which C is proposed to
                         be deported.

                   5) Exception  2  applies  where  C  has  a  genuine  and
                      subsisting relationship with a qualifying partner, or
                      a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with a
                      qualifying child, and the effect of  C's  deportation
                      on the partner or child would be unduly harsh.

                   6) In the case  of  a  foreign  criminal  who  has  been
                      sentenced to a period of  imprisonment  of  at  least
                      four years, the public interest requires  deportation
                      unless there are very compelling circumstances,  over
                      and above those described in Exceptions 1 and 2.

                   7) The considerations in subsections (1) to (6)  are  to
                      be taken into account where a court  or  tribunal  is
                      considering a decision to deport a  foreign  criminal
                      only to the extent that the reason for  the  decision
                      was the offence or offences for  which  the  criminal
                      has been convicted."

18. The claimant argued that Exception 1 applied to him, and he  sought  to
    demonstrate by evidence that that  was  so;  he  also  argued  that  if
    Exception  1  did  not  apply  to  him,  there  were  very   compelling
    circumstances countering the public interest: that is to say that sub-s
    (6) as interpreted by the Court of Appeal in NA (Pakistan) [2016]  EWCA
    Civ 662 at [25]-[27] as applying to those sentenced to lesser terms  of
    imprisonment, applied to him.

19. This is  the  Secretary  of  State's  appeal  against  Judge  Herlihy's
    decision, and there is no complaint about her  conclusions  of  primary
    fact.  The difficulty arises from her apparent confusion  and  arguable
    inaccuracy in applying the law to the facts she found.   She  found  as
    follows:

         "[35] ... I find that the Appellant has not lived in Jamaica  since
         he was aged 4 � and I accept that he has no ties or family contacts
         upon whom he could rely upon on his return and accept the  evidence
         of his mother that his family live in the UK or the  USA  and  thus
         would have no support on his return.   I  find  he  is  not  living
         independently and lives with his mother  and  stepfather.   He  has
         spent all his formative life in the United  Kingdom  where  he  has
         attended school and college and has not returned to  Jamaica  since
         coming to the United Kingdom and has spent all his adult life  here
         (three years).  ... I also find that the Appellant is a  vulnerable
         young man and has a diagnosis of AHDH [sic]  which  has  been  long
         suspected but only very recently confirmed and in respect of  which
         he is now prescribed medication.  I found  him  to  be  a  credible
         witness and find it likely that some of his offending was  possibly
         linked to his own cannabis use  which  he  said  he  had  taken  to
         alleviate his symptoms.  ... [there is also evidence  of]  symptoms
         suggestive  of  an  autism  spectrum   diagnosis   [and]   possibly
         undiagnosed special educational needs.

         [36]  I have also noted the report from Mr de Noronha  which  deals
         generally with the position of deportees from the Untied Kingdom to
         Jamaica.  This finds that those returning without  family  support,
         tend to be deportees who left  Jamaica  as  children  and  did  not
         maintain contact with their country of birth and  end  up  homeless
         and face myriad difficulties on return as they do not know  how  to
         operate practically or culturally in Jamaica.  At section 2 of  the
         report Mr de Noronha refers to the evidence  of  the  high  violent
         crime rate (among the highest in the world) and the  evidence  that
         deported persons are especially vulnerable to crime as  victims  of
         extortion and robbery and that they are instantly  recognisable  as
         foreign; are stigmatised and at increased risk of becoming a victim
         of crime.  The author  refers  to  the  Home  Office  guidance  for
         deportees indicating that deportees should use  local  accents  and
         dialects and try to lodge in safe areas.  Mr de Noronha also states
         that only 1% of Jamaicans speak English and most use Patois, Creole
         or Afro-English and that this is what is spoken by  most  Jamaicans
         and that the inability to speak and use the local  dialect  exposes
         deportees as it identifies them as potential targets.  Further  the
         author notes the very high rate of youth unemployment."

20. The judge had recorded and apparently accepted the claimant's  mother's
    evidence that the claimant speaks only English and has no knowledge  of
    any Patois.  The judge also made a number of comments on the  level  of
    the claimant's sentence and his history apart from his offending.   Her
    conclusions are as follows:

         "[38] The  Appellant  is  a  vulnerable  individual  who  would  be
         returning without family support with a diagnosis  of  ADHD  and  a
         possible autism disorder to a country where deportees face  a  risk
         of violence  and  exploitation.   I  note  that  the  Appellant  is
         currently undergoing follow up treatment from  Croydon  Adult  ADHD
         services and is prescribed medication for his condition.  The  Dr's
         report clearly referred to  the  Appellant's  chronic  issues  with
         social interaction and communication which I find would render  him
         additionally vulnerable on return to Jamaica.  His vulnerability is
         evidenced by the bullying he sustained whilst imprisoned.

         [39] However  it  is  apparent  that  the  Appellant  has  spent  a
         significant period of time lawfully in the UK where  he  has  lived
         since the age of 4 �; has not left the UK and is now aged 20 having
         spent well over half his life living here.  The respondent does not
         dispute that the Appellant has spent a significant period  of  time
         lawfully (although finding that only 8 years and  1  month  of  his
         residence was lawful) in  the  UK  and  that  he  is  socially  and
         culturally integrated.  At the date of the decision it was accepted
         that the Appellant had been in the UK for 14 years and 7 months  of
         which 8 years and 1 month of  his  residence  was  lawful  and  the
         Appellant satisfies paragraph 399A (a) and (b) and section 117  (C)
         (4) (a) and (b).  Much of the period of time where  the  Respondent
         disputes that the Appellant was living in the UK without leave  was
         when the Appellant was a minor living in the care of his mother.

         [40] In considering all the evidence in the round, I find that  the
         Appellant has established that there are significant  obstacles  to
         his integration to Jamaica  and that the  Appellant  satisfies  the
         requirements of paragraph 399A and section 117 C (4) and  that  the
         public interest does not require his [deportation] as  Exception  1
         applies.  I further find that very compelling  circumstances  exist
         which outweigh the public interest in deporting him.  To  rebalance
         the scales in favour of the  Appellant  against  deportation  there
         must be very compelling reasons which must  be  exceptional  and  I
         find that  in  weighing  up  all  the  relevant  factors  that  the
         Appellant has established that very  compelling  reasons  exist  to
         outweigh the public interest."

21. It appears to be clear that the judge found that the requirements of  s
    117C(4) were met, and that, in addition,  there  were  very  compelling
    circumstances over and above  those  described  in  Exception  1.   The
    Secretary of State argues that neither sub-s (4) nor sub-s (6)  applies
    to this claimant.  Both sub-s 4(c) and sub-s (6) require a  measure  of
    assessment, and the judge failed to  show  how  the  circumstances  she
    identified,  including  in  particular  the  claimant's  vulnerability,
    demonstrated either very significant obstacles to his integration  into
    Jamaica  or  very  compelling  circumstances  outweighing  the   public
    interest  in  deportation.   Further,  the  judge's  conclusions  on  s
    117C(4)(c) were flawed on their face, because  she  had  undertaken  an
    inappropriate calculation in para  [39],  and  in  para  [40]  she  had
    referred not  to  "very  significant  obstacles"  but  to  "significant
    obstacles", an obviously less rigorous test.

22. These are formidable arguments.  In the  circumstances  of  this  case,
    however, it seems to  us  that  the  issues  on  appeal  now  are  best
    addressed by examining the statutory requirements in the context of the
    evidence before the First-tier Tribunal Judge.

23. The first requirement is that "(a) C has been lawfully resident in  the
    United Kingdom for most of C's life".  According to  the  Secretary  of
    State's  calculations  as  set  out  in  the  decision  letters,   this
    requirement was not met.  As is  apparent  from  the  passages  of  the
    determination we have  set  out,  the  judge  does  not  seem  to  have
    concerned herself very much with the relevant calculation.  We set  out
    above the relevant dates and periods.  The  period  of  the  claimant's
    lawful residence in the United Kingdom totals 10 years, 1 month and  14
    days.  At the date of the notification to him of the deportation  order
    he was aged 19 years 2 months and 9 days: at the date of  the  decision
    following further representations he was aged 19 years 6 months  and  4
    days.  In either case he had been in the United Kingdom for  more  than
    half of his life.  The judge was wrong to think that the  claimant  met
    this requirement on the basis of her calculation, but,  as  Mr  Lindsay
    accepted before us, it does appear that that requirement was met.

24. The second requirement is "(b) C is socially and culturally  integrated
    in the United Kingdom".   The  judge's  conclusion  in  favour  of  the
    claimant on this point was challenged by the Secretary of State in  her
    grounds of appeal.  Judge Blundell declined to  regard  that  point  as
    arguable, because it was clear to him that the  position  before  Judge
    Herlihy after reviewing the file that the position before Judge Herlihy
    was that the respondent accepted that this requirement was  met.   That
    is clearly right, and before us, Mr Lindsay did not  suggest  that  any
    other conclusion was appropriate.

25. That leaves "(c) there would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to  C's
    integration into [Jamaica]".  The first question is whether  the  judge
    applied this requirement at all, or whether, as her words in para  [40]
    suggest, she applied a lower test of  merely  "significant"  obstacles.
    There is no doubt that the  wording  of  this  paragraph  is  extremely
    unfortunate,  and  quite  properly  gives  rise  to  concern  from  the
    Secretary of State on behalf of the public.  Nevertheless,  it  appears
    to us  that  it  is  simply  a  typographical  error.   The  judge  had
    throughout the  rest  of  her  decision  correctly  referred  to  "very
    significant" obstacles.  And  it  is  also  perfectly  clear  that  she
    regarded the requirements of sub--ss (4)  and  (6)  as  in  some  sense
    flowing into one another.  We doubt whether she was right  about  that;
    but she seems certainly to have treated the circumstances of which  she
    was aware as constituting "very compelling circumstances"  and  falling
    within sub-s (6).  So far as her assessment is concerned, therefore, we
    reach the view that, despite the way in which she expressed it, she did
    decide that there would be very significant obstacles to the claimant's
    integration in Jamaica, and that she  applied  that  test  despite  the
    omission of the word "very" in her expression  of  it  at  that  single
    point.

26. If that be the case, the respondent's attack has to be on  whether  she
    was entitled to reach that view,  or  alternatively  whether  she  gave
    sufficient reasons for it.  The grounds allude only to  the  claimant's
    vulnerability and to the time spent in the United Kingdom.  They wholly
    omit the important matters set out in para [36] of the decision,  which
    we  have  cited  above  and  which  the  judge  obviously  regarded  as
    important.  The evidence taken as a whole, as it seems to us, is  amply
    sufficient to entitle a judge to conclude that the claimant, as a young
    deportee without any family or  other  support,  standing  out  by  his
    language (if not for other reasons) as a recent arrival,  being  liable
    to stigmatisation and victimisation on that  ground,  and  in  addition
    suffering  from  social  disadvantages,  would  face  very  significant
    obstacles in integration in Jamaica.  We do not say that the judge  was
    bound to reach that conclusion: it is sufficient that she was  entitled
    to reach it.

27. Our conclusion is therefore that the judge was entitled  to  find  that
    the claimant met the requirements of Exception 1.  As we have said, her
    route to that conclusion appears to lack rigour; but  in  our  judgment
    there is no good reason  to  set  it  aside  for  error  of  law.   The
    Secretary of State's appeal is accordingly dismissed.
