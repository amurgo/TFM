                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   In a decision promulgated on 17th  May  2018,  the  appellant's  appeal
    against a decision to refuse to issue him with  a  permanent  residence
    card was dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge O'Garro ("the  judge").
    Having heard evidence from the appellant and his sponsor (his  brother)
    and submissions made by the appellant's representative and a Presenting
    Officer, the judge found that the appellant had not shown that he  fell
    within regulation 8(2) of  the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2006 ("the  2006  Regulations"),  as  a  dependant  of  his
    sponsor.  The appellant was required to show  household  membership  or
    dependency for a period of five years and the judge's assessment of the
    evidence was that he was unable to make out his case.

2.   Permission to appeal was granted by  a  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  on
    12th July 2018.  In a rule 24 response from  the  Secretary  of  State,
    dated 4th September 2018,  the  appeal  was  opposed.   The  respondent
    submitted that the judge directed herself appropriately in relation  to
    the test for showing dependency and the conclusion reached that he  was
    not dependent on his EEA national brother was open to her in the  light
    of evidence showing that the  appellant  earned  on  average  �800  per
    month.  Indeed, it would have been irrational to conclude otherwise.

3.   The appellant appeared in person.  He was accompanied  by  his  brother
    and Mr Ahmed Diri was present as the  Tribunal's  interpreter.   I  was
    satisfied that the appellant and  Mr  Diri  understood  each  other  in
    Somali.  I explained Mr  Avery's  role  as  the  Secretary  of  State's
    representative.

4.   I explained the procedure to be followed to the appellant,  emphasising
    that the task of the Upper Tribunal was to decide whether  the  judge's
    decision  contained  a  legal  error.   The  appellant  said  that   he
    remembered the hearing and was aware of the decision made by the judge,
    dismissing his appeal.  I summarised the respondent's rule 24  response
    and the appellant said that he understood it.  I reminded the appellant
    of the written grounds in support of his application for permission  to
    appeal, prepared by a firm of solicitors.  The appellant said  that  he
    had a copy of those grounds with him and wished to rely upon them.

5.   I asked the appellant whether he wished to  say  more  or  add  to  the
    written grounds.   He  replied  that  the  rule  24  response  was  not
    accurate.  It was at the end of 2013 that he moved out of his brother's
    house.  His employment at the time of the Tribunal hearing was not full-
    time.  He spent the past few years working  part-time.   He  now  lived
    again with his brother but at  the  time  of  the  appeal  hearing  his
    brother's friend let him  occupy  a  room  and  his  brother  paid  the
    appellant's rent.

6.   The appellant said that his income was not enough to meet his needs  as
    he has to pay fees, public transport and so on.  He  has  a  girlfriend
    and  they  have  a  son  together.   His  brother  has  supported   him
    continuously.  The appellant's earnings of  �800  per  month  were  not
    enough and he could not pay the rent himself.   He lived again with his
    brother because his job had  been  terminated.   At  the  time  of  the
    judge's decision, he did not have sufficient income and could  not  pay
    for accommodation, which was why his brother supported him financially.
     His brother would put money into his bank account.

7.   Mr Avery said that the grounds asserted that the judge  had  failed  to
    follow guidance given in case  law,  including  Duahoo  and  Lim.   The
    decision showed, however, that the judge directed herself  properly  on
    the case law and the relevant principles.  She understood that  it  was
    not in issue that the appellant had previously lived with his  brother.
    The issue for decision was whether the appellant  could  qualify  as  a
    dependant.  She summarised the judgment in Lim at paragraph 17  of  the
    decision.  The question was  whether  the  appellant  depended  on  his
    brother to meet his essential needs.  The factual background  in  terms
    of the evidence appeared at paragraphs 18 to 21.   The  judge  assessed
    the evidence regarding finances and employment.  In 2015 to  2016,  the
    appellant earned �11,443.35 and a P60 for the  year  ending  5th  April
    2015 showed annual income of �8,340.75.   The  extent  of  the  support
    available from the appellant's brother was summarised at paragraph  21.
    The summary of the evidence was accurate.  The appellant said that  his
    income was insufficient but the judge made an assessment which was open
    to her.  The appellant's essential needs were capable of being met from
    his own income.  The decision was soundly made and the legal principles
    properly applied.  The decision should be upheld.

8.   The appellant said that his monthly income of �800 at the time was  not
    enough.  The house was provided by his brother, who also paid the rent.
     Without his brother's support he would be unable to live.   There  was
    proof in his bank account.  The appellant had no money  left  over  and
    that was why his brother supported him.

Findings and Conclusions on Error of Law

9.   As noted above, the task of the Upper Tribunal is a  relatively  narrow
    one.  I must decide whether the judge  made  a  mistake  in  law.   The
    appellant described his case in such a way  that  it  is  obvious  that
    events have moved on and he is no longer in employment and has returned
    to live with his brother.  Even though  there  has  been  a  change  of
    circumstances, my focus is on the decision made by the judge.

10.  In the written grounds, it was contended that the  judge  misunderstood
    the relevance of Lim [2015] EWCA Civ 1383 and that the judgment of  the
    Court of Appeal had no bearing on the appellant's case.   This  is  not
    so.  The judgment contains important guidance relevant to  the  present
    appeal.  The court held that it is not enough to  show  that  financial
    support is provided to a claimant  by  an  EEA  national.   The  family
    member in receipt of the support must need it to meet basic needs.   If
    the family member is able to support himself or herself, there will  be
    no dependency for the purposes of the  2006  Regulations,  even  though
    financial support is received from a sponsor.

11.  The judge clearly understood this.  She also had clearly in  mind  that
    as the appellant lived apart from his brother, he had to show  that  he
    was dependent upon his brother to meet the requirements of regulation 8
    of the 2006 Regulations.  It  is  not  correct,  as  suggested  in  the
    grounds, that the judge misunderstood  the  requirements  of  the  2006
    Regulations.
12.  I agree with Mr Avery that the judge  summarised  the  evidence  before
    her accurately and that she was entitled to find as  a  fact  that  the
    appellant had not shown that he was  dependent  on  his  sponsor.   His
    basic needs could be met from his net income, shown to be nearly �8,400
    in the tax year ending 5th April 2015.  That finding of fact  was  open
    to the judge on the evidence before her.

13.  In conclusion,  the  grounds  of  appeal  are  not  made  out  and  the
    appellant has not shown that the judge made an  error  of  law  in  the
    decision she made.  There is no basis on  which  to  set  the  decision
    aside and so it shall stand.
