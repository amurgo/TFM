Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr R Layne, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr L Tarlow, Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the Appellant's  appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Harrington promulgated on 9th  May  2017  in  which  she
    refused the Appellant's appeal on human rights grounds, in  respect  of
    the appeal against the Respondent's decision to refuse to  grant  entry
    clearance to the Appellant as a spouse.

 2. Within the Grounds of Appeal, which are a  matter  of  record  and  are
    therefore not repeated in their entirety here, but which I  have  fully
    taken account of, it is stated that  as  the  Sponsor  is  entitled  to
    Personal Independence Payments she was exempt from  having  to  provide
    evidence of an income of �18,600 per annum and that  she  only  had  to
    provide evidence of being able  to  maintain  and  accommodate  herself
    adequately without recourse to public funds.

 3. The judge's findings between paragraphs 37 and  41  are  challenged  in
    terms  of  the  judge's  findings  regarding  the  credibility  of  the
    Sponsor's brother, regarding a job offer to the Appellant,  and  it  is
    further argued that the judge erred  in  terms  of  the  assessment  of
    whether there was adequate maintenance and accommodation following  the
    Immigration Appeal Tribunal's decision in KA  (Pakistan)  [2006]  UKAIT
    00065 in which it  was  found  that  the  requirement  of  adequacy  is
    objective and the level of income and  other  benefits  that  would  be
    available if the  family  were  drawing  income  support  remained  the
    yardstick.

 4. It is argued that the income support level for  a  couple  over  18  is
    �114.85 per week, and it is said that the Sponsor's income and benefits
    combined are in excess of that figure.  It is further  argued  that  in
    respect of the judge's findings on accommodation that the Sponsor has a
    tenancy of which he has exclusive possession.  It is argued  tat  there
    is no need to obtain permission from the landlord for the Appellant  to
    live there, and it is further argued that the Sponsor requires dialysis
    at least twice per week, and it is said that the Sponsor would  not  be
    able to visit the Appellant and that the judge's findings that he could
    are irrational.

 5. Permission to appeal has  been  granted  in  this  case  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Andrew on 9th June 2017.  He found  that  there  was  an
    arguable error of law in the judge coming to conclusions that the judge
    arguably did not take account of the guidance in KA  (Pakistan)  [2006]
    UKAIT 00065 and arguably did not take  note  of  the  earnings  of  the
    Sponsor from Dominos.  It  was  also  said  to  be  arguable  that  the
    question of accommodation had not been properly considered and  it  was
    arguable that in making findings  that  the  sponsor  could  visit  the
    Appellant in India  the  judge  did  not  note  the  Sponsor's  medical
    condition.

 6. I have also received and taken full account of the Respondent's Rule 24
    reply dated 27th June 2017 in which it is argued that  the  judge  made
    findings which were properly open to her on the  evidence  and  it  was
    open to the judge to consider whether the Appellant would be adequately
    maintained within the UK and that the Grounds of  Appeal  amount  to  a
    mere disagreement with the judge's findings.

 7. I have also heard careful submissions both by Mr Layne, Counsel for the
    Appellant, and also Mr Tarlow on behalf of the Secretary of State,  and
    I have fully taken account of those in reaching my decision.

 8. Looking at the first challenge to the judgment  on  the  basis  of  the
    evidence given regarding the job offer it is  argued  that  finding  is
    inadequately reasoned.  At  paragraph  39  the  judge  found  that  the
    evidence of the Sponsor's brother in relation to the job offer for  the
    Appellant to be unimpressive as he was unable to explain  how  he  both
    had very loyal staff with a low turnover and a constant  vacancy.   The
    judge found that at its highest, his evidence appeared to be that  when
    they received deliveries they were short-handed, i.e. temporary  rather
    than permanent vacancy, and he was vague on how he came  to  offer  the
    job and in his oral evidence he gave no indication that  he  had  Skype
    interviewed the Appellant as referred to in one of  the  letters.   The
    judge said that that cast doubt on  the  reliability  of  the  evidence
    regarding the job and overall she  concluded  that  he  was  trying  to
    assist his brother, but on the basis of the evidence, the Appellant had
    not proved that there was ongoing work for her  to  undertake  and  for
    which she would be paid.  The judge has given adequate  and  sufficient
    reasons for her findings in that regard.  Although it  is  said  within
    the Grounds of Appeal that it was a job at minimum  wage  cleaning  and
    one that anyone could do, the judge had  given  adequate  and  credible
    reasons for rejecting the evidence of a job offer.

 9. In the second Ground of Appeal it is argued the judge  failed  to  take
    account of the earnings of the Sponsor at  Dominos,  a  pizza  delivery
    company, when assessing whether or not there was adequate  maintenance.
    In that regard Mr Layne refers me to the contract  of  employment  with
    Dominos, at page 99. Although saying that the rate of pay will be �7.60
    per hour, the contract does not, as Mr Layne  properly  concedes,  give
    any minimum number of hours.  Although  in  re-examination  before  the
    First-tier Judge, it was said that the Sponsor works thirteen hours  at
    �7.60, Mr Layne properly concedes that there were no actual wage  slips
    or other documents, to prove the actual hours and total amount  earned.
     The judge at paragraph 40 stated:

         "In relation to the adequate maintenance requirement  there  is  no
         requirement for specified documents to be provided.  However, there
         is a requirement for the  Appellant  to  prove  her  case  and  the
         information before me does not include the necessary calculation or
         the evidence for me to undertake the calculation.  In particular, I
         do not know what impact the Appellant's presence in  the  UK  would
         have on the Sponsor's entitlement  to  benefits,  such  as  housing
         benefit or council tax reduction, or liability to make payments for
         those accommodation expenses".

10. She went on to find that the Appellant had not proved that she would be
    adequately maintained in the UK without recourse to public  funds.   In
    that regard, as Mr Tarlow points out, there was no actual  schedule  of
    the amount of income or benefits or other  expenses,  such  as  housing
    benefit and council tax, that would  be  payable.   Although  there  is
    evidence  within  the  bundle  as  to  the  amount  of   the   Personal
    Independence Payment at page 13 at �21.80 and  the  Employment  Support
    Allowance at page 17 in  the  sum  of  �72.40,  as  Mr  Layne  properly
    concedes, there was actually no documentary evidence before  the  judge
    as to the level of entitlement to housing benefits or what council  tax
    would be paid and there is no evidence as to the changes in any council
    tax or housing benefit were the Appellant to come to the UK.

11.   Obviously if the Sponsor was previously living on his own then  there
    may be an increase in council tax payable, if no longer entitled to the
    single person's discount.  But clearly without evidence as to the level
    of housing benefit and the other council tax and other liabilities, and
    in circumstances where the judge did not have any actual wage slips  to
    confirm the Sponsor's level of income, it was open to the judge on that
    evidence to find that there was insufficient evidence for her to  carry
    out the necessary calculation in order to determine whether or not  the
    available funds were above or below the income support threshold.

12. In respect of accommodation the judge also was not satisfied  that  the
    Appellant could be actively accommodated within the UK without recourse
    to public funds, and found at paragraph 42 that there was  no  evidence
    demonstrating the Sponsor's  landlord  would  allow  the  Appellant  to
    reside in the property with him. It is argued that this was not a  case
    of sub-letting, it was simply a case of a spouse  coming  to  join  the
    Sponsor in the UK.

13. The tenancy agreement that was before the judge was in very short  form
    format at pages 190 and 191, where reference was made to members of the
    household. The Appellant was not mentioned. It was open to the Judge on
    the evidence to find there was insufficient evidence to show  that  the
    landlord would  actually  allow  or  had  consented  to  the  Appellant
    residing within his property even though they were spouses.

14. It is further argued that the judge had failed to properly consider the
    Sponsor's health in finding at paragraph 43 of  her  judgment  that  he
    could go and visit her in India.  It is said that he requires  dialysis
    and he is of very limited means and the finding that  the  Sponsor  can
    visit the Appellant in India  is  irrational.   However  the  judge  at
    paragraph 43 noted that the Sponsor did not want to move to  India,  he
    was cautious about visiting again given his ill  health  that  followed
    his last visit, but she found that the evidence did not establish  that
    the medical treatment in India caused his ill health.  As a result  she
    concluded on the balance of probabilities  that  the  Sponsor's  health
    would not prevent him from visiting the Appellant in India.

15.  As Mr Layne properly concedes there were no medical reports  or  other
    medical evidence before the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  regarding  the
    Sponsor's health. Nor was there evidence regarding the  cost  of  short
    term dialysis treatment in India. The Judge has taken  account  of  the
    Sponsor's ill health, but found  that  there  was  inadequate  evidence
    before her to conclude that he could not visit the Appellant in  India.
    Given the lack of evidence within the Appellant's bundle that was again
    a finding open to her on the facts.

16. Having carefully considered the Grounds of Appeal  and  the  challenges
    made to this decision I am not persuaded that the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal Judge does contain any  material  errors  of  law  and  I
    therefore maintain the  decision.  There  is  nothing  to  prevent  the
    Sponsor making a further application with all  the  requisite  material
    being presented.  However, the judge made findings which were  open  to
    her on the evidence before her and the decision  does  not  reveal  any
    material error of law.  I therefore dismiss the appeal.

Notice of decision

The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Harrington  does  not  reveal  any
material errors in law and is maintained.
