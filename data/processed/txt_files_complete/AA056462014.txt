Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr S Jaisri, instructed by Kanaga Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr S Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Urthiran Balasuppirmaniyam, date of birth 26.9.83, is  a
    citizen of Sri Lanka.

 2. This is his appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Wyman, who dismissed his appeal  against  the  decisions  of  the
    respondent to refuse his asylum,  humanitarian  protection,  and  human
    rights claims, and to remove him from the  UK.   The  Judge  heard  the
    appeal on 10.9.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Cox granted permission to appeal on 30.10.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 10.12.14 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Wyman should be set aside.

 6. In essence, the grounds contend that:

      a) The judge's adverse credibility assessment was  flawed  because  it
         was based on reasons that were themselves untenable in law for  the
         reasons given in the grounds;

      b) The assessment of risk on return was similarly flawed.

 7. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Cox considered that the grounds
    have arguable merit.  "I  would  in  particular  question  the  judge's
    assessment of risk on return given  the  elements  of  the  appellant's
    account, including his diaspora activities and  his  detention  on  his
    voluntary return in 2010, that she did accept and having regard to  the
    Country Guidance in GJ. The grounds disclose an arguable material error
    of law in the determination and permission is granted."

 8. The Rule 24 response, dated 14.11.14, submits that the  judge  directed
    herself appropriately and the grounds  advanced  disclose  no  arguable
    errors of law that would be considered capable  of  having  a  material
    impact on the outcome of the appeal and are no more than an attempt  to
    reargue the case. "It is respectfully submitted that overall, the First-
    tier Tribunal Judge's determination is detailed, takes all the evidence
    into account and finds for numerous reasons that the appellant's  claim
    to be at risk on return  to  Sri  Lanka  is  not  made  out.  Moreover,
    contrary to the appellant's grounds, the  learned  judge  has  provided
    adequate reasons to support the  adverse  credibility  findings,  which
    were reasonable and properly open to the  judge  on  the  facts  before
    her."

 9. "The respondent will submit  that  the  learned  judge  considered  the
    evidence before her  in  the  round  and  made  reasonable  sustainable
    findings that the appellant has failed to discharge the burden of proof
    to the requisite standard to show that he fell within the  GJ  guidance
    as to who would be at risk on return to Sri Lanka. It  is  respectfully
    submitted that  the  learned  judge  correctly  followed  the  guidance
    contained in GJ and made findings that were properly open to  her  that
    the appellant did not fall into any of the risk categories."

10.  At  the  outset  of  the  hearing,  I  drew  the  attention   of   the
    representatives to the recent decision of the Court  of  Appeal  in  MN
    (Sri Lanka) [2014] Civ 1601, indicating that I would have  to  consider
    the submission in the light of that decision.

11. In MN (Sri Lanka) the First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  accept  that  the
    authorities in Sri Lanka were interested in the appellant  or  that  he
    would be at risk of harm if he were returned there. The  tribunal  also
    found that the appellant had no profile of a kind that would put him at
    risk on return and that, even if his  account  were  true,  he  was  no
    longer  of  interest  to  the  authorities.  The   appellant   obtained
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on the grounds that  it  was
    arguable that the First-tier Tribunal had failed to have proper  regard
    to the medical evidence and had failed to explain properly why  it  did
    not accept that the appellant had been injured at the hands of the army
    as he claimed. The Upper Tribunal dismissed the appeal, as  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge had considered the evidence properly and fully  and
    had given sufficient reasons for the conclusions he had reached. He had
    not made a positive finding that the appellant had not been detained or
    beaten as he alleged; the appellant had simply failed  to  satisfy  him
    that he had been detained and tortured by the army, as he claimed.

12. From �9 the Court of Appeal observed,

         "These  findings  presented  Ms  Jegarajah  with  something  of   a
         challenge, since it was necessary for her to submit,  as  she  did,
         that the medical evidence admitted of only one conclusion,  namely,
         that the appellant's account was true, and that it was perverse  on
         the part of Judge Burnett not  to  have  made  a  finding  to  that
         effect.  She  submitted  that  the  tribunal   had   rejected   the
         appellant's account as lacking  credibility  without  having  taken
         into account the injuries themselves, which tended to  support  his
         claim."

         "Detention and  torture  by  the  army  in  the  circumstances  the
         appellant had described was one possibility, but there were others;
         for example, he could have been the victim of an attack  by  people
         who had a grudge against him, or he could have  been  detained  and
         tortured by the authorities under  circumstances  and  for  reasons
         other than those he described, or his injuries could even have been
         inflicted with his consent to improve his claim for asylum. It  was
         impossible to say when the injuries  were  inflicted  and  his  own
         account  of  the  circumstances  in  which  he  received  them  was
         unsatisfactory in a number of significant respects. It is unfair to
         say that the tribunal rejected the claim of torture because it  did
         not fit the view it had  taken  independently  of  the  appellant's
         credibility; it was  simply  not  persuaded  that  the  appellant's
         injuries had been inflicted  by  the  authorities  in  the  way  he
         described. In my view it is not possible to say that the First-tier
         Tribunal was perverse or that it erred in law in not accepting  the
         claimant's account as reliable."

13. To succeed on the basis of failure to accord sufficient weight  to  the
    medical injuries the appellant would  have  to  demonstrate  that  they
    admitted of only one conclusion, namely, that the  appellant's  account
    was true, and that it was perverse on the part of the judge not to have
    made a finding to that effect.

14. There was a further  difficulty  for  that  appellant.  The  First-tier
    Tribunal found that even if the appellant's account  were  accepted  at
    face value and he had been detained and tortured  by  the  army  as  he
    described, he would no longer be of interest to the authorities  if  he
    were to return to Sri  Lanka.  The  basis  of  the  finding  was  that,
    following the suppression of the LTTE, the  authorities'  attention  is
    now directed only to those elements of the population  and  members  of
    the Sri Lankan diaspora who are thought to have a desire and an ability
    to undermine the  regime.  There  was  nothing  about  the  appellant's
    activities, either in Sri Lanka or this country, which  suggested  that
    he might fall into  that  category.  At  �13  Lord  Justice  Moore-Bick
    stated:

         "Ms Jegarajah submitted that, if the appellant had at one time been
         of sufficient interest  to  the  authorities  to  be  detained  and
         tortured and had obtained his freedom by bribery  before  the  army
         had chosen to release him, the authorities had not exhausted  their
         interest in him and  he  therefore  remained  at  risk  on  return.
         Whether that is so or not, however, is a question of fact, on which
         the tribunal was entitled to reach its own conclusion based on  the
         evidence before it. Ms Jegarajah accepted  that  the  tribunal  had
         correctly applied the country guidance as it stood at the  date  of
         its decision and in my view the  finding  that  the  appellant  was
         unlikely to be of any further interest to the authorities  was  one
         which it was entitled to make in the light of the  evidence  before
         it. If, therefore, the First-tier Tribunal did make an error of law
         in failing to accept the appellant's account, it was immaterial  to
         the outcome of the appeal.

15.  In  the  present  appeal,  Judge  Wyman  found  in  a   detailed   and
    comprehensive assessment of the appellant's case that he had  served  3
    years in the LTTE from 2003 and then came to the UK  in  2007.  It  was
    accepted that he had attended various  demonstrations  but  was  not  a
    leader in any of the communities he supported. At �93 she stated,  "His
    role appears to be that of very low level activity in simply  attending
    demonstrations and giving out leaflets." At �94, the  judge  concluded,
    "I therefore do not find that the appellant's activities in the  United
    Kingdom reaches the threshold  to  be  granted  asylum  in  the  United
    Kingdom. Nor do I  find  that  the  appellant  is  a  "committed  Tamil
    activist working for Tamil separatism and to  destabilise  the  unitary
    Sri Lankan state." I find  the  appellant  wishes  to  demonstrate  his
    opposition to the government - but this is significantly different from
    somebody who is actively working to destabilise the government."

16. In respect of the appellant's claim to have been arrested, detained and
    tortured when he returned to Sri Lanka in January 2010, the judge found
    that overall the appellant's evidence was very vague, noting a distinct
    lack of detail of the  circumstances  of  detention  in  his  screening
    interview, his asylum interview and his witness statement.  At �100 the
    judge accepted that he may have been  questioned  at  the  airport  and
    released, and that he was arrested from the family home  the  following
    day. However, at �102, the judge  did  not  accept  that  he  had  been
    detained and tortured for 10 days,  noting  the  inconsistency  of  the
    appellant stating that it was for 8 days. At �103, the  judge  accepted
    that he would have been interrogated about his activities in the UK and
    accused of taking part in demonstrations, but did not  accept  that  he
    had been accused of collecting money for the LTTE, which the  appellant
    denied. Neither did the  judge  accept  that  the  appellant  had  been
    released on the payment of a bribe organised by his uncle in Canada. "I
    believe  the  appellant  was  simply  arrested,  interviewed  and  then
    released because he had no significant information to provide."

17. At �105 the judge did not accept the appellant's evidence about leaving
    Sri Lanka. The reasons for refusal letter  explains  the  Secretary  of
    State's understanding of exit procedures  at  �49,  based  on  detailed
    information supplied by the British High Commission in Colombo in 2012.
    The judge did not accept the appellant's evidence, particularly as  his
    original passport had been stamped on exit with  no  problems  for  the
    appellant on leaving. Mr Whitwell also pointed out that  the  appellant
    left with his sister, which fact the appellant does not mention in  his
    witness statement at all, claiming that the agent escorted him  through
    the airport and as far as the Maldives.

18. Complaint  is  made  that  the  judge  relied  on  the  fact  that  the
    appellant's passport was stamped on exit  when  GJ  found  that  it  is
    possible to leave Sri Lanka through the airport by corrupt means,  even
    when a person is actively sought. However, this was but one  strand  of
    the overall credibility assessment.  I  cannot  see  that  absent  this
    finding the conclusion on credibility could  or  would  have  been  any
    different. The judge was entitled to reach a  view  that  she  did  not
    believe the claim.

19. Notwithstanding the claimed detention and torture,  the  appellant  did
    not claim asylum for a further 4  years,  which  the  judge  found  not
    credible if he had been detained and tortured as claimed, especially as
    had a good command of English and he had family in  the  UK  who  could
    have assisted him to make an asylum  claim.  Even  when  the  appellant
    attended the doctor, he did not  claim  that  he  had  been  beaten  or
    tortured, but simply stated that he could not sleep. Neither did he see
    a counsellor or psychologist, or received  any  other  treatment  until
    shortly before his appeal hearing in 2014. The judge took into  account
    the psychiatric report, but noted that it was not  being  claimed  that
    the appellant's mental health reached the Article 3 threshold.

20. The judge also took into account the claimed visit of  the  authorities
    to the appellant's mother in April 2014, finding at �112 that one visit
    in 4 years did not illustrate that he is of interest to the Sri  Lankan
    authorities.  Noting  the  timing  of  the  letter  to  be  after   his
    application for further leave to remain was refused the  judge  stated,
    "Instead, I find that letter was sent by his mother in order to bolster
    his application for asylum."

21. It was for all of those reasons, essentially taking the evidence in the
    round, that the judge concluded at �113 that she was not satisfied that
    the appellant had established a well-founded  fear  of  persecution  on
    return, or that the requirements for humanitarian protection  or  human
    rights were met.

22. The grounds of appeal complain that the judge applied  too  high  of  a
    test and speculated, for example, as to whether  his  uncle  in  Canada
    could have arranged an agent if he was not  in  the  country.  However,
    what the judge is saying is that looking at his evidence  as  a  whole,
    she was not persuaded to the lower standard of proof by  the  appellant
    that his factual account of events in Sri Lanka in  2010  was  accurate
    and reliable, including the alleged involvement of his uncle in Canada.
    The judge has given reasons for that conclusion. I also note  that  the
    appellant's sister's statement  claims  that  it  was  her  mother  who
    contacted the uncle and sought his help. However, the mother  makes  no
    mention of that in her letter and there is no evidence from  the  uncle
    in support of such a claim or to explain how he managed to  arrange  it
    all from Canada. The same applies to  the  mother's  letter  about  the
    visit of the authorities to the home; the judge was  not  persuaded  of
    the claim and gave reasons for that conclusion.

23. Complaint is also made that the judge failed to  consider  the  medical
    evidence in an appropriate way  between  �108  and  �109  and  that  in
    particular the judge failed to take into account  that  PTSD  may  have
    affected the appellant's ability to give evidence. However, there  does
    not appear to have been any  difficult  for  the  appellant  in  giving
    evidence, either of difficulty in remembering or confusion over  dates,
    or the like. His asylum interview answers are very clear and given in a
    matter of fact fashion. At  A63-A64  of  the  appellant's  bundle,  the
    conclusions are that the appellant has a  moderate  depressive  episode
    and "some symptoms" of PTSD. However, he was not receiving the  correct
    treatment for  his  condition  and  in  particular  was  not  on  anti-
    depressant medication.  It  suggests  that  he  may  suffer  a  serious
    deterioration in his mental health if returned to Sri Lanka.  At  14(f)
    the doctor stated  that  the  appellant's  concentration  is  poor  and
    recommended time to comprehend the questions and to be allowed  regular
    breaks. However, there was nothing in his  evidence  as  recorded  that
    suggested any of those features. Mr Jaisari, who did not represent  the
    appellant at the First-tier Tribunal, did not make any submissions that
    the appellant was  unfairly  treated  during  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    appeal hearing or that any of his answers need to be reconsidered, etc.
    In the circumstances, and in the absence of such concerns  in  relation
    to the appellant's evidence, there is little  probative  value  in  the
    medical evidence. Whether or not the appellant was  vulnerable  appears
    to be of no real relevance to the issues in the appeal. Neither  is  it
    crucial to his evidence being found vague; this appears to have  arisen
    from a lack of detail in  his  accounts,  and  not  some  inability  of
    concentration or trauma. In order to be able to succeed on this  ground
    the appellant would have  to  demonstrate  that  the  medical  evidence
    admitted of only one conclusion, that the appellant had  been  tortured
    and thus that the decision of the judge was perverse.

24. In summary, the grounds of appeal and Mr Jaisri's  submissions  attempt
    to pick apart the decision of the First-tier Tribunal piece  by  piece,
    but it has to be read as a whole in order to see that the judge made  a
    rounded assessment of  the  appellant's  factual  claim  and  found  it
    wanting of credibility. One or more strands of the  matters  relied  on
    may be criticised individually, but taken as a whole, I find  that  the
    judge's conclusions on events in 2010 and his diaspora  activities  are
    entirely sustainable and supported by cogent reasoning. In my  view  it
    is not possible to say that the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  was
    perverse or that it erred  in  law  in  not  accepting  the  claimant's
    account as reliable.

Conclusion & Decision

25. For the reasons stated above, I find that the making of the decision of
    the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of  an  error  on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed on all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable and thus there can be no fee award.
