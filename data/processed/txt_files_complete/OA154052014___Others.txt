Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mrs Heidar (Solicitor)
For  the  Respondent:     Miss  Fijiwala  (Senior  Home  Office   Presenting
Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the Appellants' appeal against  the  decision  of  First-tier
       Tribunal Judge Rose dated the  4th  June  2015  following  a  hearing
       before him at Sheldon Court, Birmingham on the 1st  June  2015.   Mrs
       Hamisha Shazada is the mother of Tamim, Sabrina  and  Zarifa  Yaguby.
       They are all citizens of Afghanistan.  The  Entry  Clearance  Officer
       refused the Appellants' applications for entry clearance, as the wife
       and children of Mr Meraab Shah  Yaqubi,  under  Appendix  FM  of  the
       Immigration Rules in decisions made on the 28th August 2014.   Within
       the original refusal decisions it was stated that the Sponsor  needed
       to establish that he was earning at least �27,200 per annum, in order
       to satisfy  the  minimum  income  requirements,  in  respect  of  the
       applications by Mrs Shazada and the three children and that  although
       it was said that the Sponsor was self-employed as a decorator and had
       been since the 1st November 2010, with an annual income  of  �33,691,
       although the  Sponsor's  declared  earnings  were  �33,691  his  bank
       statements for the period between the 6th  April  2012  and  the  5th
       April 2013 only showed deposits  amounting  to  �17,342.50.   It  was
       therefore found that the Sponsor's declared income had not been  paid
       into his bank account and that as a  result  the  specified  evidence
       requirements of Appendix FM-SE, in respect of the  Sponsor's  income,
       had not been met, as he had not  complied  with  the  requirement  to
       provide "personal bank statements for the same 12 month period as the
       tax return(s) showing that the income from self-employment  has  been
       paid into an account in the name of the person or in the name of  the
       person and their partner jointly.".

    2. The Appellants sought to  appeal  that  decision  to  the  First-tier
       Tribunal, and that appeal in respect of all  of  the  Appellants  was
       heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Rose on the 1st  June  2015,  with
       his decision dated the 4th June 2015.

       The Decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Rose

    3. Within  his  decision  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Rose  found  that
       paragraphs E-ECP.3.1  and  E-ECC.2.1  of  Appendix  FM  required  the
       Appellants to provide specified evidence  of  the  necessary  income,
       totalling �27,200 and that the Sponsor was said  to  have  an  income
       from self-employment of �33,691 in the relevant year. It was disputed
       but his bank statements only showed deposits amounting to �17,342.50.
        It was also not  disputed  before  Judge  Rose  that  the  specified
       evidence, which in relation to self-employment in the UK was set  out
       within  paragraph  7  of  Appendix  FM-SE,  included  personal   bank
       statements for  the  same  12  month  period  as  the  necessary  tax
       return(s) showing that the income from self-employment had been  paid
       into an account in the name of the Sponsor.

    4. Judge Rose noted that Mrs Heidar relied in her submissions  upon  the
       IDI of April 2015 at paragraph 9.3.8 which provided that:

       "Self-employed income can be cash-in-hand,  if  the  correct  tax  is
       paid.  In line  with  paragraph  3.1.5  of  this  guidance,  it  will
       generally be expected that the person's  business  or  personal  bank
       accounts  would  fully  reflect  all  gross  (pre-tax)  cash  income.
       Flexibility may only be applied where the decision-maker is satisfied
       that the cash income relied upon is fully evidenced by  the  relevant
       tax return(s) and the accounts information".

    5. Judge Rose found that the nature of the flexibility to be applied was
       not expressed, but in his judgment the  flexibility  related  to  the
       expectation that the person's bank account would  reflect  all  gross
       cash income rather than net income.  He further found that an undated
       IDI  produced  by  Mrs  Heidar  contained  no   reference   to   such
       flexibility.  In respect of paragraph 5.4.2  of  the  IDI,  where  it
       stated that in respect of earnings from  self-employment  "employment
       can be cash-in-hand if the correct tax is  paid",  Judge  Rose  found
       that this guidance simply referred to the way  in  which  money  from
       self-employment was received by the self-employed person, in the form
       of cash and that it was then open to him to pay such money  into  his
       bank account.  Judge Rose  was  not  satisfied  that  there  was  any
       published policy that flexibility should be applied if the  necessary
       income was not reflected  in  the  bank  statements  as  required  by
       paragraph 7(f)  of  Appendix  FM-SE,  beyond  that  provided  for  in
       paragraphs D and (1)(n).  He found that the provisions of paragraph D
       did not assist the Appellants as there was no missing information.




    6. Judge Rose further found that the decision of the Upper  Tribunal  in
       the case  of  Sultana  and  Others  (rules:  waiver/further  enquiry;
       discretion) [2014] UKUT 540 (IAC) did not assist the Appellants as in
       that case, as he found in the present appeal,  there  were  incurable
       deficiencies in meeting the requirements of the  Rules.   Judge  Rose
       found  that  not  having  complied  with   the   specified   evidence
       requirements, the Appellants could not succeed under the  Immigration
       Rules.  He further found that an appeal on Human  Rights  outside  of
       the Immigration  Rules  was  not  pursued,  either  in  Mrs  Heidar's
       skeleton argument, or in any oral submissions before him.

    7. The Appellants have sought to  appeal  that  decision  to  the  Upper
       Tribunal.  Within the Grounds of Appeal, it is  argued,  inter  alia,
       that following the Supreme Court decision in the case of  Mandalia  v
       Secretary of State for the Home Department [2015] UKSC  59,  that  if
       there was an evidential flexibility policy in place,  the  Respondent
       was under a duty to apply that policy in the Appellants' case.  It is
       argued that the First-tier Tribunal Judge's findings at [15  and  16]
       amount to a material error of law and that the  Judge  was  wrong  to
       find that the Appellants  could  not  benefit  from  paragraph  D  of
       Appendix FM-SE.  It is said that the Sponsor in his witness statement
       had provided a full explanation as to why his  income  had  not  been
       deposited into his account and that this explanation was supported by
       evidence from an accountant.  It is further argued that in respect of
       the IDI that cash-in-hand is acceptable and that  the  IDI  makes  it
       clear that flexibility can  be  applied  where  the  cash  income  is
       evidenced by the tax return and other supporting  documentation.   It
       is argued that the First-tier Tribunal Judge failed to understand the
       meaning of "cash-in-hand", which  it  is  argued  in  business  terms
       simply means money not going through the  bank  account  and  it  was
       argued that cash-in-hand was defined in the dictionary as "money  and
       notes, kept to pay small amounts but not deposited in the  bank"  and
       that all that had to be established was  that  the  correct  tax  was
       paid.  It was argued that it had been established that it was in fact
       the IDI dated  July  2014  that  was  applicable  given  the  refusal
       decisions were dated  the  28th  October  2014  and  that  the  Entry
       Clearance Officer had not followed the applicable IDI  and  that  the
       Sponsor had submitted all requisite  information  including  his  tax
       returns and SA302, as well as evidence that he had paid  tax  on  his
       declared income to HMRC  and  that  in  such  circumstances  the  IDI
       allowed flexibility regarding the fact that not all of the  Sponsor's
       income had been deposited into his bank account.

    8. Although permission to appeal was  initially  refused  by  First-tier
       Tribunal Judge Wellesley-Cole, permission to appeal was  subsequently
       granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Bruce on the 15th November 2015, when
       she found that although the Grounds of  Appeal  were  repetitive  and
       unhelpfully sought  to  rely  upon  unreported  decisions,  they  did
       identify an arguable issue of law arising from the decision  and  the
       "evidential flexibility" paragraph of the IDI, namely that where  the
       only defect in an Appendix FM application is the failure  to  produce
       bank statements as evidence of salary, to what extent can this defect
       be remedied by other evidence, for instance by evidence  of  payments
       made to HMRC.

    9. I am most grateful to Miss Heidar for her helpful skeleton  argument,
       which I have fully taken account of, and  for  the  oral  submissions
       made at the Upper Tribunal appeal hearing by Mrs Heidar on behalf  of
       the Appellants and by Miss Fijiwala on behalf of the  Respondent.   I
       have fully taken account of all of the arguments raised  both  within
       the original Grounds  of  Appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  the
       initial Grounds of Appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal,  the  Supplemental
       Grounds of Appeal to the Upper Tribunal, the skeleton  argument,  and
       the oral submissions.  I have further taken account of  the  original
       reasons for refusal letters,  the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal
       Judge  Rose,  the  initial  refusal  of  permission  to  appeal,  the
       subsequent grant of permission to appeal, the relevant IDI and all of
       the evidence contained within the respective bundles,  which  I  have
       carefully considered in reaching my decision.

       My Findings on Error of Law and Materiality

   10. When the appeal originally came before me on the 25th February  2016,
       at that time it was unclear as to which IDI actually applied  and  as
       to the exact wording of that IDI.  I therefore adjourned  the  appeal
       on that occasion in order that that situation could be  clarified  by
       the parties, and it has now been  agreed  that  the  appropriate  and
       applicable IDI was that dated the 29th  July  2014,  given  that  the
       decisions in the case were made on the 28th August 2014.

   11. It was not  in  dispute  before  me  that  under  the  provisions  of
       paragraph E-ECP.3.1 and E-ECC.2.1 of Appendix FM that the  Appellants
       were required to show  a  specified  gross  annual  income  totalling
       �27,200, given that there were three children Appellants in  addition
       to Mrs Shazada, the wife.  It was also not in dispute before  me,  as
       it was not in dispute before First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Rose,  that
       although the Sponsor said that he had an income from  self-employment
       of �33,691 in the relevant year,  his  bank  statements  only  showed
       deposits totalling �17,342.50.

   12. The requisite specified evidence in respect of self-employment in the
       UK are set out within paragraph 7 of Appendix FM-SE and the specified
       evidence in respect of the sponsor's self-employment in the  UK  that
       had to be produced  at  the  time  of  the  application  is  set  out
       paragraph 7 of Appendix FM-SE.  At paragraph 7(f) that included "bank
       statements for the same 12 month period as the tax return(s)  showing
       that the income from self-employment has been paid into an account in
       the name of the person or in the name of the person and their partner
       jointly".

   13. Mrs Heidar  on  behalf  of  the  Appellants  argued  that  evidential
       flexibility could be exercised under paragraph D of  Appendix  FM-SE,
       in that under paragraph D(d)(iii), as a document had  been  submitted
       that did not contain all of the specified information, but she argued
       that the missing information was  verifiable  from  "other  documents
       submitted with the application", in respect of the evidence from  the
       SA302, saying that tax was  payable,  together  with  the  subsequent
       payment of tax by the Sponsor and all of the tax  documentation,  and
       evidence from the Sponsor himself and accountant.

   14. However, this case is very different from the  situation  of  a  case
       where, for example, a letter from a bank or building society does not
       contain specified information, such as the account number or the date
       of the letter or the financial institution's name and logo.  In  this
       case, the actual specified evidence required under paragraph 7(f)  is
       that the income from self-employment has been paid into an account in
       the name of the person or the name of the person  and  their  partner
       jointly.  The specified evidence is not simply the level of the gross
       and/or net income, the specified evidence is evidence of  payment  of
       that  income  from  self-employment  into  the  bank  account.    The
       requirement under paragraph 7(f) for the personal bank statements for
       the same 12 month period as the tax return(s) showing that the income
       from self-employment has been paid into an account in the name of the
       person or the name of the person and their partner  jointly,  clearly
       indicates and establishes that this is evidence needed to corroborate
       the contents of the tax  return.   The  tax  return  itself  and  the
       statement of account under SA300 or SA302,  although  also  specified
       evidence under paragraph 7(b) are not, under paragraph 7,  themselves
       sufficient.  The bank statements have to show for that same 12  month
       period as the tax return, payment of the income from  self-employment
       into the account.  That is the specified evidence,  the  evidence  of
       payment of the income into the account.  Given that not  all  of  the
       Sponsor's income, it is conceded was paid into his account, then  the
       Appellants cannot benefit from paragraph D of Appendix FM-SE, as  the
       missing specified information in terms of the payments into the  bank
       account, are not verifiable from other documentation  submitted  with
       the application.  The level of the  gross  or  net  income  might  be
       ascertainable by other parts of the specified evidence that had to be
       submitted under paragraph 7 including the tax return and  SA302,  but
       not the specified evidence in  respect  of  payments  into  the  bank
       account.

   15. Nor does the flexibility contained within paragraph 1(n)  assist  the
       Appellants in this case. Paragraph 1(n) states that:

       "The gross amount of  any  cash  income  may  be  counted  where  the
       person's specified bank statements show the net amount which  relates
       to the gross amount shown on  their  payslips  (or  in  the  relevant
       specified  evidence  provided  in  addition  to  the  specified  bank
       statements in relation to non-employment  income).   Otherwise,  only
       the net  amount  shown  on  the  specified  bank  statements  may  be
       counted".

   16. In this case, it was agreed and conceded on behalf of the  Appellants
       that not all of the  net  income  went  through  the  Sponsor's  bank
       account.  This is not a case therefore  where  simply  the  full  net
       amount of the income having gone through the bank account, this could
       be utilised in  conjunction  with  other  evidence  provided  by  the
       Sponsor as a self-employed person, to show the gross  amount.   Here,
       not all of his income went through the bank account.

   17. In respect of the IDI dated the  29th  July  2014  and  the  argument
       raised by Mrs Heidar that as a result of paragraph 9.3.7 of the  IDI,
       that not all of the Sponsor's income  had  to  go  through  the  bank
       account, I note in this regard the wording of paragraph 9.3.7 of  the
       IDI.  That paragraph states:

       "9.3.7 Self-employed income can be cash-in-hand if the correct tax is
       paid.  In line with  paragraph  3.1.5  of  this  guidance,  it  would
       generally be expected that the person's  business  or  personal  bank
       statements would fully  reflect  all  gross  (pre-tax)  cash  income.
       Flexibility may only be applied where the decision-maker is satisfied
       that the cash income relied upon is fully evidenced by  the  relevant
       tax return(s) and the accounts information".

   18. Paragraph 3.1.5 states:

       "3.1.5 Under paragraph 1(n) of Appendix FM-SE the gross amount of any
       cash  income  may  be  counted  where  the  person's  specified  bank
       statements show the net amount which relates to the gross  amount  on
       their payslips  (or  the  relevant  specified  evidence  provided  in
       addition to  the  specified  bank  statements  in  relation  to  non-
       employment income).Otherwise,  only  the  net  amount  shown  on  the
       specified bank statements may be counted."

   19. In my judgment,  it  is  perfectly  clear  that  paragraph  9.3.7  is
       referring to paragraph 3.1.5, and  the  flexibility  under  paragraph
       1(n) of Appendix FM-SE that the gross amount of any cash  income  may
       be counted where the person's specified bank statements show the  net
       amount which relates to the gross amount in  the  relevant  specified
       evidence provided in addition to the specified  bank  statements,  in
       relation to non-employed income, and  that  otherwise  only  the  net
       amount shown on the specified bank statement  may  be  counted.   The
       specific reference to paragraph  3.1.5  in  paragraph  9.3.7,  in  my
       judgment makes it clear  that  the  paragraph  is  providing  further
       guidance in respect of paragraph 3.1.5 and the flexibility  contained
       within paragraph 1(n) of  Appendix  FM-SE.   It  is  not  seeking  to
       establish that  there  is  a  general  flexibility  to  consider  the
       relevant tax return(s) and  the  relevant  accounts  information,  in
       circumstances where not all of the net income goes through  the  bank
       account.  There would have been flexibility here  had  the  Sponsor's
       net income fully gone through the bank account.  It has  not.   I  do
       not find that the IDI whether under paragraph 9.3.7 or otherwise, nor
       the Immigration  Rules,  provide  the  flexibility  asserted  by  the
       Appellants in such circumstances.  If not all of  the  Sponsor's  net
       income has gone through the bank account, as is the case  here,  then
       the specified evidence requirements of Appendix FM-SE are not met.

   20. In respect of Mrs Heidar's  argument  regarding  "cash-in-hand",  she
       submits the definition provided on the website businessdictionary.com
       as being "money  and  notes,  kept  to  pay  small  amounts  but  not
       deposited in the bank". This does not  assist  the  Appellants  given
       that the reference at paragraph 9.3.7 of the  IDI  to  "self-employed
       income can be cash-in-hand if the  correct  tax  is  paid"  does  not
       simply mean that the Sponsor's net income does not need to wholly  go
       through his bank account, it is  just  referring  to  the  evidential
       flexibility that the full amount of the gross income does not need to
       be paid into the bank account if the net income has  been  paid  into
       the bank account and that the flexibility contained within  paragraph
       1(n) of Appendix FM-SE can be taken advantage of if the requisite and
       relevant specified information has been provided which shows the  net
       and the gross income.

   21. In such circumstances, the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Rose
       does not contain any material error of law and is maintained.

First-tier               Tribunal               Judge                McGinty
Dated 6th April 2016
