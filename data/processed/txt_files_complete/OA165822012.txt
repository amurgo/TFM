                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


Introduction

 1. The Appellant is a male citizen of Brazil born on 12th September  1976.
    He applied for entry clearance to the UK as the civil  partner  of  the
    Sponsor, James Miller.  That application was refused  by  a  Notice  of
    Decision dated 9th August 2012 which was confirmed following  a  review
    by an Entry Clearance Manager on  4th  February  2014.   The  Appellant
    appealed, and his appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Symes
    (the Judge) sitting at Hatton Cross on 6th June 2013.   He  decided  to
    allow the appeal under the Immigration Rules for the reasons  given  in
    his Determination promulgated on 27th June 2013.  The Respondent sought
    leave to appeal that decision and on 17th July 2013 such permission was
    granted.

Error of Law

 2. We must first decide if the decision of the Judge contained an error on
    a point of law so that it should be set aside.

 3. The issues before the Judge were limited to those  of  maintenance  and
    accommodation.  The Judge found that the requirements of paragraph  281
    of HC 395 were satisfied as to accommodation and that finding  has  not
    been challenged in this  appeal.   The  Judge  allowed  the  appeal  as
    regards maintenance because although he was not able to  calculate  the
    disposable income of the Sponsor  and  therefore  make  the  assessment
    necessary  following  the  decision  in  KA  &  Others   (Adequacy   of
    Maintenance) Pakistan [2006] UKAIT 00065, he  was  satisfied  that  any
    shortfall there may be between the Sponsor's net income and the  amount
    of the Appellant and Sponsor's combined entitlement to  income  support
    would be made up by capital made available by  the  Appellant's  mother
    amounting to �3,169 and the likelihood  of  the  Appellant  earning  an
    income from employment following his arrival in the UK.

 4. At the hearing, we first allowed Ms Kiss to amend the Grounds of Appeal
    as drafted.  Ms Kiss then referred to those grounds and submitted  that
    the Judge had erred in law.  He had failed to explain why he had relied
    upon a letter from Tesco, the Sponsor's employer, dated 3rd  July  2012
    to calculate the Sponsor's net earnings although its contents  did  not
    agree with the Sponsor's wage slips.  This was a  point  argued  before
    the Judge at the hearing.  Further, the Judge had failed to  take  into
    account any housing costs of the Sponsor in calculating his net  income
    for KA purposes, and had failed  to  explain  why  he  had  taken  into
    account third party support from the  Sponsor's  mother  following  the
    decision in Mahad & Others v ECO [2009] UKSC 16.  Overall the reasoning
    of the Judge was insufficient owing to the lack of evidence produced by
    the Appellant to satisfy the Immigration Rules.

 5. In response, Mr Hart acknowledged that the Respondent's submissions had
    strength, but argued that they only amounted to a disagreement with the
    Judge's decision and did not reveal an error of  law.   The  Judge  had
    adopted a common sense approach and  had  decided  the  issues  in  the
    appeal  on  the  balance  of  probabilities.   He  had  exercised   his
    discretion to use the  letter  of  Tesco  to  establish  the  Sponsor's
    income.

 6. We find an error of law in the decision of the Judge so that it is  set
    aside.  In our view, the Judge ignored the  fact  that  the  burden  of
    proof was upon the Appellant  to  show  that  he  met  the  maintenance
    requirements of the relevant Immigration Rule.  Therefore  it  was  for
    the Appellant to show that the income of the Sponsor less  his  housing
    costs was adequate applying the test given in KA & Others.  Instead  of
    applying this burden, the Judge speculated as  to  the  income  of  the
    Sponsor net of his housing costs and  therefore  as  to  the  shortfall
    between that income and  the  entitlement  of  the  Appellant  and  the
    Sponsor to income  support.   That  being  the  case,  it  was  further
    speculation by the Judge that  such  shortfall  could  be  met  by  the
    capital of a  third  party  or  the  Appellant's  prospective  earnings
    following his arrival in the UK.

 7. Having reached that conclusion, we decided to remake  the  decision  of
    the Judge on the basis of the evidence before him.  The  Appellant  had
    not complied with the Direction of Principal  Resident  Judge  Southern
    concerning any further evidence.

Remade Decision

 8. We heard further submissions from the parties.  Ms  Kiss  addressed  us
    first when she argued that the Appellant had failed to show that  there
    would be adequate maintenance for him.   There  was  a  lack  of  clear
    evidence as to the Sponsor's earnings.  The  information  contained  in
    the letter from Tesco, the Sponsor's  employer,  conflicted  with  that
    given in his wage slips.  There was no evidence  as  to  the  Sponsor's
    housing costs.  It was probable that the net income of the Sponsor less
    his housing costs would produce a  shortfall that was likely to  be  in
    excess of �30 per week.  However, it was not likely that  this  deficit
    would be made up by any earnings of the Appellant following his arrival
    in the UK.  The Appellant had  no  employment  arranged,  and  had  not
    worked in the UK since 2003.  It was also unlikely that such  shortfall
    could be made up by the Appellant's mother. She lived  in  Brazil,  and
    there was no indication as to her financial commitments there.  It  was
    pure speculation that she would be willing or able to finance  even  in
    part the Appellant's living expenses in the UK.

 9. In response, Mr Hart referred us to his Skeleton Argument used  at  the
    First-tier hearing and argued there was sufficient evidence to indicate
    that in probability the Appellant would be maintained adequately in the
    UK.  Mr Hart conceded  that  the  Appellant  could  not  succeed  under
    Article 8 of the ECHR.

10. We find that at the date of decision, being 9th August 2012,  that  the
    Sponsor was employed by Tesco working  fifteen  hours  per  week.   His
    earnings are given as �112.67 per week but it is not known if that is a
    gross or net figure.  The Appellant's wage slips indicate that he earns
    something less, perhaps in the region of about �90 net per  week.   The
    Sponsor also received Employment and Support Allowance amounting to �71
    per week.  For the purpose of making the  calculation  given  in  KA  &
    Others it is necessary to deduct the Sponsor's living costs.  These are
    not known.  However the probability is that having made that  deduction
    the Sponsor's income is somewhat  less  than  the  entitlement  of  the
    Appellant and the Sponsor to income support which at the relevant  time
    amounted to �111.45 per week.  We are not satisfied that the  Appellant
    has shown that any deficit can be made up by his potential earnings  in
    the UK or any contributions from capital made by the  Sponsor's  mother
    resident in Brazil.  There is no evidence of  any  employment  arranged
    for the Appellant in the UK, and he has not  worked  in  the  UK  since
    2003.  There is a letter from the Appellant's mother stating  that  she
    will assist, and although there is evidence that  she  had  savings  of
    �3,169 at the relevant time,  there  is  no  evidence  of  her  overall
    financial circumstances, nor of her willingness to take on a  long-term
    commitment.  We conclude that on this evidence the Appellant has failed
    to discharge  the  burden  of  showing  that  there  will  be  adequate
    maintenance for him in the UK.

Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

We set aside the decision.

We remake the decision in the appeal by dismissing it.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to Rule  45(4)(i)  of
the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005 and  we  find  no
necessity to do so.

Fee Award

In the light of our decision  to  remake  the  decision  in  the  appeal  by
dismissing it, we have  considered  the  decision  made  by  the  First-tier
Tribunal as to a fee award.  We make no fee award as  the  appeal  has  been
dismissed.
