For the Appellant:     Mr Nath
For the Respondent:    Ms Sher


                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. Mrs Begum is a citizen  of  Bangladesh  born  in  1963.   She  appeals
      against a decision of the ECO, Dhaka, made on 8  April  2016  refusing
      her application for entry clearance as a visitor under paragraph  V4.2
      of Appendix V of the Immigration Rules.

   2. In her application she states she wishes to visit her son and daughter-
      in-law in the UK who  had  recently  given  birth  to  triplets.   She
      intends to stay for eight weeks.


   3. The application was refused because the ECO considered that Mrs  Begum
      had not provided satisfactory evidence of her financial circumstances.
       She is retired and widowed.  She claims to  derive  a  total  monthly
      income of ï¿½190 from savings and investments as well as from properties
      and rents.  In support of her application  she  had  provided  a  land
      title deed, letter of enclosure, an agreement for ejected tenant and a
      land development tax receipt.  Such documents, in the ECO's view,  did
      not provide evidence of her income as claimed.


   4. Bank statements from Southeast Bank Ltd were noted.  Two accounts were
      in her and her UK son's name, a third in her and another  son's  name.
      However, the ECO noted these items were all over three months old.


   5. The ECO also noted that she had previously been refused a visa in  the
      same category as she had not provided  satisfactory  evidence  of  her
      finances.  The ECO added that  she  had  failed  to  provide  any  new
      evidence to  show  that  the  doubts  about  her  intentions  are  not
      justified.


   6. The ECO  concluded  that  Mrs  Begum  had  not  provided  satisfactory
      evidence of her circumstances in Bangladesh to show she  is  genuinely
      seeking entry for a purpose that is permitted by  the  visitor  route,
      that she will leave the UK at the end of the visit and  that  she  has
      sufficient funds for the cost of the trip.


   7. She appealed.


      First tier hearing


   8. Following a hearing at Taylor House on 5 July 2017, Judge of the First-
      Tier Majid allowed the appeal.


   9. His reasoning appears  to  be  at  paragraphs  [12]  to  [15]  of  the
      decision.  At [12]  he  states  her  witness  statement  gives  him  a
      'knockout reason to allow the  appeal.   It  is  clear  that  she  has
      approached the ECO on two previous occasions to come to the UK to have
      the company of her grandchildren.  The daughter-in-law  told  me  that
      she has had triplets and this was definitely an exciting event.'


  10. At [13] he records his pleasure that the mother of  the  triplets  had
      attended the hearing and that she had asked that  the  case  be  given
      priority because her triplets needed her attention.


  11. At [14] he notes that the ECO 'has spent a great deal of time' on  the
      'personal resources' of Mrs Begum.  While he acknowledged  that  there
      is 'more danger of violation of the immigration control by the poverty
      of a person', there was however 'not  a  fibre  of  other  independent
      evidence to show  that  the  appellant  should  be  saddled  with  the
      inference of bad faith'.  He added that the  ECO  'should  have  taken
      notice of the local tradition that an affluent relative living in  the
      West can help a relative of meagre means to visit the advanced part of
      the world; the host also giving himself the benefit of  the  appellant
      coming here rather than taking leave from his busy life  to  go  to  a
      developing country and being sure of  his  legal  obligation  and  not
      having any concern that the family visitor would be a burden on public
      funds.'


  12. At [15] he makes a comment that a return air ticket  is  most  usually
      purchased by a visitor as a one way ticket  is  very  expensive:  'The
      ticket having been purchased the appellant's  visit  to  this  country
      becomes a minor issue.'


  13. The ECO sought permission to appeal which was granted on  4  September
      2017.


      Error of law hearing


  14. At the error of law hearing before me Ms Sher agreed with Mr Nath that
      the decision could not stand.  It suffices to say that the judge  made
      no adequate analysis of any of the material issues  and  the  evidence
      relevant to them that was placed before him. He  has  failed  to  give
      adequate reasons for his decision to allow the appeal.  I agreed.


  15. By consent the decision was set aside to be remade.


  16. I heard brief submissions.  Mr Nath said that the case failed  at  the
      first hurdle.  There was no evidence of sufficiently  strong  ties  to
      amount to family life. In any event it was still unclear  whether  the
      income, particularly rental, was shown in the bank statements.


  17. In her submissions, Ms Sher, invited to address the  issue  of  family
      life, said the position is at it is.  The facts  cannot  be  enhanced.
      It was important that the grandchildren get to know their grandmother.
       There is no practical alternative to her coming here to do  so.   The
      family could not afford to go to Bangladesh.  The purpose to the  trip
      is not whimsical.  It would only be a short visit.  Ms Sher said  that
      the concerns about her finances had been addressed.   Perusal  of  the
      documents showed that  her  claimed  income  is  consistent  with  the
      evidence.  As for the risk of her  not  returning  she  has  property,
      family and friends and her own well established life there.


      Consideration


  18. In considering this matter the correct approach is set  out  in  Adjei
      (visit visas - Article 8) [2015] UKUT 0261 in which it  was  held  (at
      [9]) that the first question to be  addressed  in  an  appeal  against
      refusal to grant entry clearance as a visitor where only human  rights
      grounds are available is whether Article 8  is  engaged  at  all.   If
      there is no family life and/or insufficient interference in  any  such
      family life to engage Article 8, that is the end of the  matter.   The
      appeal fails.  If however there is a family  life  and  Article  8  is
      engaged, then the next question to consider is  whether  the  decision
      was lawful, taken in pursuit of a legitimate  aim  and  necessary  and
      proportionate  in  a  democratic   society.    In   the   context   of
      proportionality, it will need to be decided  whether  the  Immigration
      Rules were in fact met (as part of the proportionality exercise  under
      Article 8 and not as a separate  ground  of  appeal  under  the  Rules
      themselves, to which there is no entitlement) because, in  the  normal
      course,  it  is  hardly  likely  to  be  proportionate  to  refuse  an
      application for entry to a person who is entitled to entry  under  the
      respondent's own Immigration Rules and equally if the  Rules  are  not
      met then section 117B(1) of the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum
      Act 2002 will weigh heavily against the appellant.  In  this  respect,
      if in fact the Immigration Rules are not  met  then  of  course  there
      would need to be compelling circumstances outside of the Rules  before
      the appeal could succeed on the basis of proportionality under Article
      8.

  19. In considering the first question of whether there is family life  Mrs
      Begum is the mother of the sponsor.  She wishes to visit him, his wife
      and their recently born triplets, her grandchildren.


  20. Ms Sher made brief reference to Marckx v Belgium  [1979]  2  EHRR  330
      submitting  that  it  was   authority   for   the   proposition   that
      relationships between grandparents and grandchildren  are  potentially
      within the scope of 'family life'. In that regard I note the  decision
      of the ECHR in GHB V  United  Kingdom  (Application  number  42455/98)
      which states at page 5:


      'The Court recalls that the expression "family life" in Article 8  (1)
      is  broad  enough  to  include  the  ties  between  grandparents   and
      grandchildren (see Marckx v Belgium)...'

  21.  However, it does not necessarily  follow  that  the  existence  of  a
      grandparental relationship automatically results in  Article  8  being
      engaged. In GHB the  applicant  was  one  of  two  grandparents  whose
      grandchild had been adopted when aged 12 following some three years in
      foster care brought about by her mother's unstable mental health.  The
      grandchild had lived with  the  grandparents  temporarily,  for  three
      months, when aged 10 and during the  following  year  there  had  been
      regular contact. This was sufficient for the court  to  conclude  that
      there was  family  life  between  grandparents  and  grandchild  under
      Article 8.


  22. That decision lends emphasis to the proposition that the  question  of
      whether there exists family life will inevitably be a  fact  sensitive
      one.


  23. Again, in immigration cases 'there is no presumption that a person has
      a family life, even with the members of a person's  immediate  family.
      [Kugathas v SSHD [2003] INLR 170 (at [24] per Arden LJ). As the  court
      also indicated normal emotional ties between mother and adult  son  do
      not without more, constitute family life under Article 8. At [19]  per
      Sedley LJ, the court said: 'neither blood ties  nor  the  concern  and
      affection that ordinarily go with them are, by themselves together, in
      my judgment, enough to constitute family life.'


  24. More recently, the former President (McCloskey J)  gave  guidance.  In
      Mostafa (Article 8 in Entry Clearance) [2015] UKUT112 it was said  (at
      [24]: 'It will only be in very unusual  circumstances  that  a  person
      other than a close relative will be able to show that the  refusal  of
      entry clearance comes within the scope of Article 8(1).  In  practical
      terms this is likely to be limited to cases where the relationship  is
      that of husband and wife or other close life partners or a parent  and
      minor child...'


  25. As indicated, it is a fact sensitive issue to be determined on a  case
      by case basis. In respect of the relationship with  her  son  and  his
      wife, there is no evidence as to the amount and frequency  of  contact
      between Mrs Begum and them (or indeed before they  came  to  the  UK).
      There is no evidence of anything beyond what I assume to be the normal
      bonds of affection between  Mrs  Begum  and  her  son  and  his  wife.
      Further, the son's statement specifically indicates that she does  not
      depend on her son for any financial support.  On the  evidence  before
      me that relationship does not disclose sufficiently strong  ties  such
      as to fall within the scope of Article 8.


  26. In respect of the grandchildren, who it appears were born in 2016,  it
      is understandable that Mrs Begum would wish to  see  them.  I  see  no
      reason to doubt that it would be difficult not least in practical  and
      financial terms for the children to  be  taken  to  Bangladesh  for  a
      visit. On the evidence before me it is unclear what, if  any,  contact
      she has with them. In my view it would be wrong  to  take  a  lack  of
      contact as a factor against her not least because she has sought  such
      contact only to be refused more than once by  the  ECO.  However,  the
      fact remains there is again nothing  before  me  that  shows  anything
      above normal emotional ties, the normal interest a  grandmother  would
      have in her grandchildren who at such a young age gain  no  meaningful
      benefit from their grandmother. She is a grandmother who does not make
      decisions for them, who is not involved in  any  way  in  their  care.
      Again,  the  factual  basis  in  my   judgment   in   the   particular
      circumstances of this case does not show family life for  the  purpose
      of Article 8 between Mrs Begum and the grandchildren.

  27.  As Adjei indicated, family life not being engaged, that is the end of
      the matter.  The appeal fails.
