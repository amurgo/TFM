For the Respondent:    Ms J. Howorth, Westkin Associates


                            DECISION AND REASONS

  1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  against  the  decision  of
     First-tier Tribunal Judge Oliver promulgated on 18 July 2017  in  which
     he allowed Mr.  Hussain's  appeal  against  the  Secretary  of  State's
     decision to refuse to issue a permanent residence card.

  2. For the purposes of this decision I refer to the Secretary of State  as
     the Respondent, and to Mr. Hussain as the Appellant,  reflecting  their
     positions as they were before the First-tier Tribunal.

  3. Permission to appeal was granted as follows:

         "The judge had concentrated on the issue whether the Appellant's ex-
         spouse had been exercising treaty rights,  understandable  as  that
         appears to have been the main issue in the  case.   However  it  is
         arguable that in a short decision there  is  no  reference  to  the
         Appellant's own position in terms of exercise of treaty rights such
         as work as if he was an EEA citizen from the date  of  the  divorce
         onwards a requirement under the regulations for the Appellant to be
         granted a permanent residence card for which he had applied.  It is
         arguable therefore that the judge erred in not considering at all a
         significant aspect of this case."


  4. At the hearing I set aside the decision to the extent that  it  allowed
     the appeal under the EEA Regulations without having made findings as to
     the Appellant's own exercise of Treaty rights.  The findings in respect
     of the Appellant's ex-spouse were not challenged,  and  these  findings
     stand.  I stated that I would remake the decision having considered the
     Appellant's exercise of Treaty rights.

Error of Law

  5. In the Respondent's decision to refuse to issue a  permanent  residence
     card to the Appellant it clearly states that  the  Appellant  needs  to
     provide evidence that, since the date of the divorce,  he  had  been  a
     worker, a self-employed person or a student (page 2).  In  the  grounds
     of appeal before the First-tier Tribunal, it  was  submitted  that  the
     Appellant had provided sufficient evidence that  he  was  currently  in
     employment and had been employed prior to the breakdown of his marriage
     [3].  However, the Judge did not consider at all  the  Appellant's  own
     exercise of Treaty rights.

  6. In the grounds of appeal before this Tribunal there was no challenge to
     the finding that the Appellant had shown, through checks  conducted  by
     the Respondent, that his ex-spouse had been  exercising  Treaty  rights
     for the relevant period.

  7. As accepted in the grounds of appeal before this Tribunal, and  as  was
     agreed at the hearing, the Appellant needed to show that he was working
     from the date of divorce until 27 June 2016.  I  find  that  the  Judge
     erred in allowing the appeal  without  having  considered  this  issue.
     Accordingly, I set aside the decision to allow the appeal.

Remaking

  8. As stated above, there  was  no  challenge  to  the  finding  that  the
     Appellant's ex-spouse had been exercising Treaty rights,  and  I  adopt
     that finding here.  I find that the Appellant has shown  that  his  ex-
     spouse was exercising Treaty rights for the relevant period.  The  only
     issue before me is whether the Appellant himself was exercising  Treaty
     rights from the date of the divorce, 14  August  2014,  until  27  June
     2016.  This is a five year period starting with the date  of  marriage,
     27 June 2011.

  9. Ms Howorth provided a table which detailed the evidence provided by the
     Appellant showing his exercise of Treaty rights from 13 July 2014 until
     30 June 2016.  Ms Isherwood was given time at the hearing  to  consider
     this table, which referred to evidence in the Appellant's bundle.   The
     only objection to this evidence by Ms Isherwood at the hearing  was  in
     relation to a payment  made  in  May  2016.   I  was  referred  to  the
     Appellant's Nationwide statement of account dated 24  June  2016  (page
     255).  This shows on 31 May 2016  a  bank  credit  for  the  amount  of
     �2,013.03.  The corresponding payslip shows,  for  the  payment  period
     ending 31 May 2016, a net pay of �2,013.03 (page 187).  Ms  Isherwood's
     objection was the fact that the credit comes from the Bank  of  Baroda,
     not Ebury.  Ms Howorth stated that she had not  taken  instructions  on
     that particular point.

 10. The burden of proof lies on the Appellant and the standard of proof  is
     the balance of probabilities.  I have considered the bank statements as
     a whole.  There are statements which pre-date and  post-date  this  one
     which show some payments made to the Appellant from Ebury, for  example
     page 253, but some from Bank of Baroda.  However,  in  all  cases,  the
     amounts  paid  correspond  to  the  Ebury  payslips  provided  by   the
     Appellant.  There was no objection to the payslips at the hearing.  The
     Appellant's representative stated that she had the originals with  her,
     but there was no request to see them, and no challenge to  them.   Some
     originals were also on the Tribunal file.

 11. I find on the balance of probabilities that the payments  made  to  the
     Appellant, either from Ebury, or from Bank of Baroda, are in respect of
     his employment at Ebury.  I find that the fact that some  payments  are
     listed as coming from the Bank of Baroda, given the evidence before me,
     does not cast doubt on the Appellant's claim to have been  employed  by
     Ebury as claimed.

 12. I find, with reference to the  schedule  of  evidence  provided  by  Ms
     Howorth, and with reference to the evidence itself, that the  Appellant
     has shown on the balance of probabilities that he was exercising Treaty
     rights from the date of the divorce, 14  August  2014,  until  27  June
     2016.  The Appellant provided payslips and P60s  covering  this  entire
     period.

 13. Therefore I find,  having  taken  into  account  all  of  the  evidence
     provided, that the Appellant has shown on the balance of  probabilities
     that he was exercising Treaty rights for the  period  required  by  the
     Regulations.  I find that the Appellant has addressed  the  sole  issue
     which was outstanding before me.



Notice of Decision

 14. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.

 15. I remake the decision allowing the Appellant's  appeal  under  the  EEA
     Regulations.

 16. No anonymity direction is made.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal  and,  because  a  fee  has  been  paid  or  is
payable, I have considered making a fee award.  The  evidence  was  provided
for the appeal, not with the application.  In the circumstances  I  make  no
fee award.
