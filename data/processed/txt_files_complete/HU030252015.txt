Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Charles Addei, was born on 26 February  1952  and  is  a
    male citizen of Ghana.  He appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge
    Hillis) against the decision of the respondent dated  7  July  2015  to
    refuse him leave to remain as  the  spouse  of  a  person  present  and
    settled in the United Kingdom.  The First-tier Tribunal, in a  decision
    promulgated on 1 August 2016, dismissed the appeal.  The appellant  now
    appeals, with permission, to the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The appeal before the  First-tier  Tribunal  concerned,  in  part,  the
    refusal of the appellant's application on the basis of  allegations  of
    deception concerning an English language test.  The judge found in  the
    appellant's favour in respect of that aspect of the appeal and that the
    judge's findings are not  challenged  in  the  Upper  Tribunal  by  the
    respondent.

 3. The appellant was required under the Immigration Rules to  satisfy  the
    requirements of E-LTRP;

         E-LTRP.1.2. The applicant's partner must be-

         (a)  a British Citizen in the UK;

         (b)  present and settled in the UK; or

         (c)  in the UK with refugee leave or as a person with  humanitarian
         protection.

         E-LTRP.1.3. The applicant must be aged 18 or over at  the  date  of
         application.

         E-LTRP.1.4. The partner must be aged 18 or  over  at  the  date  of
         application.

         E-LTRP.1.5. The applicant and their partner must not be within  the
         prohibited degree of relationship.

         E-LTRP.1.6. The applicant  and  their  partner  must  have  met  in
         person.

         E-LTRP.1.7.  The  relationship  between  the  applicant  and  their
         partner must be genuine and subsisting.

         E-LTRP.1.8. If the applicant and partner are married or in a  civil
         partnership it must be a valid marriage or  civil  partnership,  as
         specified.

         E-LTRP.1.9. Any previous relationship of  the  applicant  or  their
         partner  must  have  broken  down  permanently,  unless  it  is   a
         relationship which falls within paragraph 278(i) of these Rules.

         E-LTRP.1.10. The applicant and their partner must  intend  to  live
         together permanently in the UK and, in any application for  further
         leave to remain as a partner (except where the applicant is in  the
         UK as a fianc�(e) or proposed civil partner) and in any application
         for indefinite leave to remain as a  partner,  the  applicant  must
         provide evidence that, since  entry  clearance  as  a  partner  was
         granted under paragraph  D-ECP1.1.  or  since  the  last  grant  of
         limited leave to remain as  a  partner,  the  applicant  and  their
         partner have lived together in the UK  or  there  is  good  reason,
         consistent with a continuing intention to live together permanently
         in the UK, for any period in which they have not done so.

         E-LTRP.1.11. If the  applicant  is  in  the  UK  with  leave  as  a
         fianc�(e) or proposed civil  partner  and  the  marriage  or  civil
         partnership did not take place during that period of  leave,  there
         must be good reason why and evidence that it will take place within
         the next 6 months.




         E-LTRP.1.12. The applicant's  partner  cannot  be  the  applicant's
         fianc�(e) or proposed  civil  partner,  unless  the  applicant  was
         granted entry clearance as  that  person's  fianc�(e)  or  proposed
         civil partner.

 4. I have highlighted above E-LTRP.1.7 and 1.10;  the  provisions  are  of
    particular relevance in the present appeal.  Refusing the  application,
    the Secretary of State in a letter dated 7 July 2015 wrote:

         You were previously granted EC as a spouse between 8 February  2013
         and 8 May 2015.  However, you did not come to  the  United  Kingdom
         until 17 October 2013 and returned to Ghana in  December  2013  not
         returning to the UK until late March  2015.   Whilst  you  provided
         some evidence in the form of emails and letters for the reasons for
         your absence to support elections in Nigeria, it would appear  that
         you had the option to volunteer for this work and so it was clearly
         your decision to return to Ghana and not to live with your  sponsor
         in the United Kingdom.  You have provided limited evidence, just  a
         few emails of contact with your partner whilst apart and  the  fact
         that you spent so little time in the United Kingdom (4  months  out
         of a possible 27 months) with your spouse  and  family  during  the
         previous period of leave means it  is  difficult  to  believe  that
         there is a genuine  and  subsisting  relationship  with  a  genuine
         continuing intention to live together permanently.

 5. Judge Hillis found  [53]  that  the  couple  were  "in  a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship."  However, he did not find, on the balance  of
    probabilities, that the couple intended to live together permanently in
    the United Kingdom as husband and wife.  He found  that  the  appellant
    had failed to provide a reasonable explanation as to why  he  had  left
    his wife during his claimed "retirement" with her in the UK to work  on
    a voluntary basis in Nigeria for a period of at least  fifteen  months.
    He noted that the appellant had not been contractually bound to take up
    a voluntary position in Nigeria and that such a decision  was  at  odds
    with his claim to wish to "retire" in the United Kingdom with his wife.
     He noted that the appellant had claimed that he had lived  apart  from
    his wife since 2003 when she had travelled to  the  United  Kingdom  in
    order to work.  They had:

         Maintained their ...  marriage  living  and  working  in  different
         countries despite not living with each other in the same household.
          In my judgment the appellant's behaviour since the grant of  leave
         to enter the UK dated August 2013 is that he has continued his life
         and work in the same way as he did prior  to  that  grant,  namely,
         predominantly apart from his wife in the UK.

 6. The grounds of appeal assert that the judge should  have  accepted  the
    evidence of the appellant and sponsor (his wife) that they intended  to
    live together permanently in the United Kingdom.  It was  not  rational
    for the judge to find that the couple enjoyed a genuine and  subsisting
    marriage but yet did not intend to  live  together  permanently.   That
    point is taken up by Judge Keane who granted permission to appeal.   He
    noted  that  "it  was  intrinsic  to  the  judge's  decision  that   he
    disbelieved [the evidence  of  the  appellant  and  sponsor].   It  was
    arguably incumbent upon the judge to explain  why  he  did  not  accept
    their evidence."

 7. I do not find that the judge made an inconsistent finding.   A  finding
    that a relationship is genuine and subsisting need not inevitably  lead
    a judicial decision maker also to find the parties to that relationship
    intend to live together permanently. Indeed, if that were not so,  then
    there would be no need for two separate Rules  such  as  ELTRP.1.7  and
    1.10 (see above); it would be sufficient for there to be a single  Rule
    concerning the genuine and subsisting nature of the relationship.   The
    fact that there are two separate Rules must indicate that an  applicant
    must satisfy both parts of the Rule in  order  to  succeed.   In  other
    words, the Rules envisage a scenario in which an applicant and  partner
    may be in a genuine and subsisting relationship but they do not  intend
    to live together permanently in the United Kingdom; this  is  the  very
    scenario that Judge Hillis found existed in the  present  appeal.   The
    judge had given a  number  of  reasons  (arising  rationally  from  the
    evidence before him) for reaching the conclusion that, despite being in
    a genuine and subsisting relationship,  the  appellant  had  failed  to
    prove that he intended to live permanently with his wife in the  United
    Kingdom.  In reaching that conclusion, the judge has assessed  all  the
    evidence, including the oral evidence of the appellant and sponsor.  In
    order to reach his findings, the  judge  did  not  need  to  brand  the
    appellant and sponsor as liars;  he  was  required  to  consider  their
    stated intention to live together permanently in the context of all the
    evidence and to reach a reasoned conclusion.  I find that Judge  Hillis
    has done exactly that.  He has relied upon the pattern of behaviour  of
    the appellant in the past (which have included very lengthy separations
    from the sponsor) and has concluded that such a pattern  is  likely  to
    continue in the future.  He reached  a  decision  which  is  internally
    consistent and consistent also with the Immigration Rules, as  drafted.
    I acknowledge that another Tribunal  might  have  reached  a  different
    decision but that, however, is not the  point.    It  is  not  for  the
    Tribunal to interfere with rational,  legally  sound  findings  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal.
