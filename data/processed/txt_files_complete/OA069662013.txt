                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

A. Introduction

 1. This is an appeal by Mrs Nurto Nur  Hassan  against  the  determination
    dated 26 September 2013 of  the  First-Tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Britton)
    dismissing her appeal against the decision dated 12  February  2013  of
    the Entry Clearance Officer  ("ECO")at  the  British  High  Commission,
    Nairobi, refusing Mrs Hassan's application for admission to the  United
    Kingdom, by virtue of the laws of the European  Union,  as  the  family
    member of a European Economic  Area  national  who  is  exercising,  or
    wishes to exercise, rights of free movement in the United Kingdom.

 2. On 29 October 2013 the First-Tier Tribunal (Judge E M Simpson)  granted
    permission to appeal on the ground that there was an arguable error  of
    law. Following a hearing Judge Wilson ruled that there was an error  of
    law in the determination of the First-Tier Tribunal, and directed  that
    there should be a re-hearing (in The Upper Tribunal)  of  Mrs  Hassan's
    appeal against the decision of the ECO. Judge Wilson did  not  identify
    the error of law, but both parties before us were agreed on the  nature
    of the error that he had found, and were content that we should proceed
    to re-hear the appeal.

B. The law applicable to this appeal

 3. By Regulation 7 (1)(c) of  the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2006 ("the Regulations"),  a  "family  member"  of  another
    person includes "dependent direct relatives in his  ascending  line  or
    that of his spouse or his civil partner". (emphasis added)

 4. With effect from 2 June 2011, Regulation 12 (1) provides, so far as  is
    material:

         "an entry clearance officer must issue an EEA family  permit  to  a
         person who apples for one if the person is a family  member  of  an
         EEA national and -

         (a) the EEA national -

               (i)  is  residing  in  the  UK  in  accordance   with   these
         Regulations; or

              (ii) ...

         (b) the family member will be accompanying the EEA national to  the
         United Kingdom or joining him here."

 5. Before 2 June 2011, after the words  just  cited,  Regulation  12(1)(b)
    continued:

         "and -

             (i) is lawfully resident in an EEA state; or

             (i) would meet  the  requirements  in  the  immigration  rules
             (other than those relating to entry clearance)  for  leave  to
             enter the United Kingdom as  the  family  member  of  the  EEA
             national or, in the case of direct  descendents  or  dependent
             direct relatives in the ascending line of his  spouse  or  his
             civil partner, as the family member of his spouse or his civil
             partner, were the EEA national or the spouse or civil  partner
             of a person present and settled in the United Kingdom."

 6. Regulation 12 (1)(b) was amended to its present form by the Immigration
    (European Economic Area) (Amendment) Regulations 2011. The  Explanatory
    Note referred to the case of Metock (case C-127/08) where the Court  of
    Justice of the European Union held that the rights of  accompanying  or
    joining family members apply, irrespective of whether the family member
    is already residing lawfully in another Member  State  with  the  Union
    citizen (or was so residing prior to moving to the host Member  State).
    The Explanatory Note stated that Regulation 12 (1)(b) was being amended
    in order to give effect to the judgment in Metock.

 7. In order to determine whether the relatives in the  ascending  line  of
    the spouse of a Community national are "dependent" on the  latter,  the
    host Member State must assess whether, having regard to their financial
    and  social  conditions,  they  are  not  in  a  position  to   support
    themselves. The need for national support must exist in  the  State  of
    origin of those relatives or the State where they came at the time when
    they apply to  join  the  Community  national.  There  is  no  need  to
    determine the reasons for recourse to that  support  or  to  raise  the
    question whether the person concerned is able  to  support  himself  by
    taking up paid employment. These  foregoing  propositions  derive  from
    paragraphs 22 and 23 of Centre Publique d' Aide Sociale de Courcelles v
    Lebon  [1987]  ECR  2811  and  paragraphs  36   and   37   of   Jia   v
    Migrationsverket (Case C-1/105), as explained and applied in SM (India)
    and Entry Clearance Officer (Mumbai) [2009] EWCA Civ 1426.

C. The Error of Law

 8. Unfortunately, the First-Tier Tribunal was not aware of,  and  did  not
    have their attention drawn to, the  relevant  amendment  of  Regulation
    12(1)(b). In September 2013 the First-Tier Tribunal directed itself  to
    Regulation 12(1)(b)(ii) of the Regulations as it stood  before  2  June
    2011, and applied  "the  requirements  in  the  immigration  rules"  to
    determine Mrs Hassan's appeal. In doing  so,  the  First-Tier  Tribunal
    fell into error, and the error of law materially affected  the  outcome
    of the appeal.

D. The issue in this re-hearing

 9. Mrs Dahabo Yusif Mohamed, living in Flat A, 21 Eton  Avenue,  Hounslow,
    is a national of Norway who came to the United Kingdom in 2011 to  join
    her husband. Her spouse, Mr Mohamed Abdi Abukar,  who  lives  with  Mrs
    Mohamed, is also a national of Norway. He came to the United Kingdom in
    2009 and exercises EU treaty rights through employment. Mrs  Hassan  is
    the mother of Mrs Mohamed. The only relevant issue in  this  appeal  is
    whether Mrs Hassan is a "family  member",  namely  a  dependent  direct
    relative  of  Mrs  Mohamed.  Whether  she   is   "dependent"   involves
    consideration of Mrs Hassan's current and future needs and  actual  and
    potential resources (income and/or capital), and  of  the  contribution
    made by Mrs Mohamed and Mr Abukar to supporting the needs of Mrs Hassan
    in light of her resources.

E. The Relevant Facts

10. At the re-hearing we considered witness statements  from  each  of  Mrs
    Mohamed and Mr  Abukar.  They  also  gave  oral  evidence  (through  an
    interpreter) and were cross-examined. We find  the  following  relevant
    facts.

11. Mrs Hassan is now aged 68. She is a national of  Somalia.  She  married
    another national of Somalia. Mrs Mohamed, now  aged  38,  is  the  only
    child. Mrs Hassan lived with her husband in Hargeisa,  Somaliland.  Her
    husband ran a small business as a retailer of food. Mrs Hassan did  not
    contribute to the running of the business, and did not engage  in  paid
    work during her marriage. Mrs Hassan's husband died in September  2012.
    The retail business and household furniture were sold  for  $1050.  Mrs
    Hassan used the proceeds of sale to support her essential  needs  (rent
    and food) in Hargeisa, Somaliland, for two months.  Her  own  resources
    were then depleted, and she had no source of income  or  capital  other
    than funds provided by Mrs Mohamed and her husband. She  left  Hargeisa
    and went to live in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, where she currently remains,
    living alone without close family members.

12. Mrs Hassan has several health  problems,  including  high  cholesterol,
    high blood pressure and a tumour on top  of  her  kidney.  The  medical
    treatment for these conditions also presently  requires  some  funding.
    Mrs Hassan does not perform any paid work and (in so far as this  might
    be legally relevant) would not be able to do so because of her age  and
    health problems.

13. As to the contribution made by Mrs Mohamed and her husband  to  support
    Mrs Hassan's needs, Mr Abukar works 24 hours each week at  the  minimum
    wage for Jaujar Estates Ltd, 447 Street West Road, Hounslow (apparently
    an enterprise of Mr Gurpal Sidhu), and in the  tax  year  from  6  Apil
    2011, to April 2012 he earned �7,722 (paying no  income  tax  on  these
    earnings). In addition, the  couple  received  Working  Tax  Credit  of
    �3,342 and Child Tax Credit of �16,046, a total credit of �19,389. They
    also receive from the London Borough of Hounslow annual housing benefit
    of �21,641 in respect of the property (5 bedrooms and 2 living  rooms),
    which  they  rent  from  Jaujar  Enterprises,  447  Street  West  Road,
    Hounslow, (apparently an associated enterprise of Mr Gurpal Sidhu). The
    total amount of public support to them and their 6 children is �41,032,
    comprising 84 per cent of the net annual family resources of �48,754.

14. From these resources Mrs Mohamed  and  her  husband  have  been  making
    regular and significant cash payments to Mrs  Hassan.   Given  that  Mr
    Abukar's earned tax free income of �7,722  is  relatively  modest,  and
    requires very substantial  additional  public  funding  in  order  that
    family resources are adequate to meet deemed family  needs,  it  is  an
    inescapable inference that a significant amount of these  resources  is
    being applied to support Mrs Hassan in  Ethiopia.  It  is  questionable
    whether the State intended that the publicly provided resources in this
    case should be applied in that manner, but that is not a question which
    it is relevant for this Tribunal to consider. We may only  have  regard
    to the fact that, on the evidence before us, Mrs Mohamed and Mr  Abukar
    do make regular cash payments to support the needs of Mrs Hassan.

15. We wish also to note the following.  At the hearing on 6 March 2014  Ms
    Brisset undertook to prepare and to leave on that day for the  Tribunal
    a schedule setting out the amount of each relevant payment and the date
    of  payment,  so  that  the  particulars  of  the  payments  could   be
    specifically included in this  determination.   No  such  schedule  was
    produced on that day  nor,  despite  further  enquiries,  subsequently.
    That failure has contributed to the regrettable delay  in  promulgating
    this determination.

F. Conclusions.

16.  The  First-Tier  Tribunal  made  a  material  error  of  law  in   its
    determination. On the facts that we have found (a) in  respect  of  Mrs
    Hassan's essential needs (rent and food), in the light  of  her  actual
    and potential income and capital,  and  (b)  in  respect  of  the  cash
    payments that she is receiving from Mrs Mohamed and Mr  Abukar,  it  is
    plain that Mrs Hassan is "dependent" on Mrs Mohamed and Mr Abukar.  She
    is, therefore, a relevant family member within  Regulation  7(1)(c)  of
    the Regulations, and she benefits from Regulation 12(1)(b),as a  person
    to whom the entry clearance officer must issue an EEA family permit.

17. For these reasons the appeal is allowed and the  determination  of  the
    First-Tier Tribunal is set aside.
