                                   Between

                    Harmeet Singh Kakar (first appellant)
                  Harvinder Singh kakar (second appellant)
                       (ANONYMITY DIRECTION NOT MADE)
                                                                  Appellants

                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr Holmes of Counsel, instructed by Legal Justice
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety, a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                     REASONS FOR FINDING AN ERROR OF LAW

1.   The appellants are brothers and are citizens of Afghanistan.  They  are
    both members of the Sikh religion and arrived  in  the  United  Kingdom
    with their parents on 31st March 2016.

2.   Their parents' applications for asylum and/or  humanitarian  protection
    were refused by  the  respondent  and  their  subsequent  appeals  were
    dismissed by the First-tier Tribunal  on  17th  August  2017  and  27th
    February 2018.

3.   The appellants claimed asylum in their own right on 9th July  2018  and
    those claims were refused by the respondent  in  a  letter  dated  24th
    January 2019.  The appellants appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal  and
    their appeal was heard in Manchester by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Alis
    on 11th March 2019.  He dismissed the appeals having applied AS (Safety
    of Kabul) Afghanistan CG [2018] UKUT 00118 IAC.

4.   The determination was challenged  on  the  basis  that,  amongst  other
    things, Judge Alis had failed to recognise that  the  case  of  AS  had
    subsequently been to the Court of Appeal and he failed to  have  regard
    to the decision of AS (Afghanistan) EWCA Civ 208.  Both Mr  Holmes  and
    Mr McVeety agreed this morning that the determinations  in  respect  of
    these two appeals could not stand and should be set aside.

5.   I accordingly set aside the determination and  remit  the  appeals  for
    rehearing afresh by a Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  other  than
    First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Alis.   A  Punjabi  interpreter  will   be
    required.

6.   The hearing is likely to last two hours and should not be listed  until
    the outcome of a current country guidance case is decided by the  Upper
    Tribunal in August of this year, dealing with the question of Sikhs and
    their safety in Afghanistan.

No anonymity direction is made.
