Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr E Tufan, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr P Haywood, Counsel, instructed by Lawrence Lupin
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   I shall refer to the respondent as the appellant as he was  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

2.   The appellant is a citizen of Morocco  and  his  date  of  birth  is  1
    January 1965.  He  was  convicted  of  twenty  counts  of  offences  of
    dishonestly involving benefit fraud on 19 March 2015.  As a  result  of
    this he was sentenced to sixteen months' imprisonment  and  ordered  to
    pay a fine of �8,000.

3.    Following  on  from  the  offences  the  Secretary  of  State  made  a
    deportation order. The appellant appealed against this relying  on  the
    EEA 2006 Regulations as a  result  of  his  relationship  with  an  EEA
    national.  His appeal was allowed by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal A
    M Black following a hearing on 5  September  2016.   The  decision  was
    promulgated on 16 September 2016.  The Secretary of State  was  granted
    permission by First-tier Tribunal Judge Lambert  in  a  decision  of  3
    October 2016.

4.   The First-tier Tribunal heard oral evidence from the appellant and  his
    partner and she made extensive findings including the following:

         "55. The appellant does not dispute the  records  of  his  criminal
             convictions.   The  remarks  of  the  sentencing   judge   are
             relevant.  The appellant pleaded guilty to 20 counts of  'what
             is loosely called benefit fraud'.  He entered the plea at  the
             earliest possible opportunity.   The  appellant  'successfully
             and repeatedly exploited the benefit system for over ten years
             and [was] dishonestly claiming benefits to which [he] knew [he
             was] not entitled.  The total  sum  involved  was  �52,727.38,
             made up of housing  benefit  of  about  �26,500,  council  tax
             benefit of �6,250 and Job Seekers Allowance of just  short  of
             �20,000.


         56.   The  Judge  refers  to  aggravating   factors.    There   was
             significant planning in obtaining  these  benefits  and  fraud
             from the outset.  The appellant did not  just  sit  and  claim
             benefit but actually  took  positive  steps  to  continue  the
             criminality using false identity documentation.  The appellant
             used  a  national  insurance  number,  household  bills,  bank
             account details and (in connection with Job seekers allowance)
             told the authorities he could not give his  birth  certificate
             and passport because they had been stolen.  On one occasion he
             enclosed a letter from the police.  He thus took active  steps
             to prolong the deception and to set the authorities on a trail
             through documentation he was providing to them.  The appellant
             adopted the false identity of  Frederico  Zillio,  an  Italian
             national; he lived a  false  life.   The  appellant  had  been
             granted a council tenancy of a property in Eltham on 24  April
             2000.  He had applied for it and was granted it in the name of
             Mr Zillio.  He held that tenancy for 14 years until July 2014.
              He fought eviction proceedings in Woolwich  County  Court  in
             that name.  The appellant  then  rented  that  property  to  a
             tenant who paid 12 months' rent.


         59.  The judge's remarks describe in detail the personal conduct of
             the appellant.  He has behaved dishonestly over  a  period  of
             ten years, setting up a series of frauds  for  personal  gain.
             He has not worked since 1999 and these frauds must have  given
             rise to his sole source of income  (apart  from  that  of  his
             wife).  Thus he has benefited personally from  his  fraudulent
             activities and the sole purpose of those activities  has  been
             personal gain.   He  has  gone  to  extraordinary  lengths  to
             perpetrate and perpetuate the frauds in that he  took  on  the
             identity of an Italian national, created various documents  in
             that name and effectively lived as that person.  His wife told
             me  she  had  not  been  aware  of  her  husband's  fraudulent
             activities and, to some extent, therefore,  he  was  dishonest
             with his wife with  regard  to  the  source  of  the  family's
             income.  Whilst the oral evidence of  the  appellant  was  not
             seriously challenged, I find his oral evidence to be vague and
             evasive  in  parts.   There  were  a  few   relatively   minor
             discrepancies but my overall impression is that the  appellant
             has given that evidence which he perceives to be supportive of
             his appeal and has not been open  and  transparent  about  his
             circumstances.  For example, there is no mention at all in his
             witness statement of how he has lived  in  the  UK  since  his
             arrival here.  I am left with the  impression  that  his  only
             sources of income have been his dishonest activities.


         60.  Whilst the appellant's activities may be at the lower  end  of
             the scale insofar as criminal seriousness is concerned in that
             they did not involve physical harm to individuals, these  were
             not victimless crimes: the fraud involved substantial sums  of
             money which would have otherwise been allocated to others  who
             were entitled to  social  assistance.   I  bear  in  mind  the
             judge's sentencing remarks with regard to  the  sophistication
             of the appellant's activities.


         61.  The OASys report was prepared  prior  to  sentencing.   It  is
             dated 19 October 2015.   It  is  based  on  interview,  prison
             records and OASys Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) It notes
             the appellant has been  recommended  for  deportation  in  the
             judge's remarks.  The appellant is on licence until 1  October
             2016.  The report states 'General offending % within  2  years
             of community sentence/discharge: 20'.  The  report  cites  the
             appellant's response to the SAQ to the effect  that  he  would
             'definitely not' offend in the future; this is because he  has
             a family to support and it is against his  religion.   I  give
             little weight to this  declaration  however,  given  that  the
             appellant had a family and the same  religion  throughout  the
             period of his fraudulent activities.


         62.   I  give  greater  weight  to  the  undated  letter  from  the
             appellant's probation officer.  This  refers  to  his  release
             from custody in May 2016 and I find therefore it  was  written
             after that date.  It is, to that  extent,  contemporaneous  in
             that it takes into account the appellant's state of mind after
             release from  prison.   The  probation  officer  states  '[the
             appellant] has no previous convictions and the  index  offence
             is not a violent offence.  As a result of this,  he  has  been
             assessed as posing a low risk of reoffending  [the  appellant]
             is assessed as posing the frequency of his reporting  has  now
             been reduced to once very six weeks.'  He  has  complied  with
             that reporting programme.  Given that this refers to the  risk
             of serious harm as opposed to the risk of 'general  offending'
             cited in the OASys report, I rely on the  probation  officer's
             evidence and find that the appellant is at low risk of causing
             serious harm and of reoffending.


         66.  Contrary to the assertion of the appellant  I  do  not  accept
             that his family life would act as a total deterrent for future
             reoffending: his wife and children did not act as a  deterrent
             in the past.  That said, his wife is now aware of his previous
             criminal  activities  and  I  find  she  would  have   greater
             influence over him now than she had previously.   It  is  also
             the case that he had embarked on his criminal activities prior
             to meeting and marrying his wife and prior  to  the  birth  of
             their children; thus, so some extent, he had embarked upon and
             became reliant upon, his criminal activities, and  the  income
             they produced, before his family life was created.   Whilst  I
             have doubts about the reliability of the appellant's  evidence
             and his assertion that he will never reoffend, I accept he  is
             at low risk of reoffending and that there is  a  low  risk  of
             serious harm.   He  was  cautioned  in  2009  in  relation  to
             offences under the Fraud Act but I have no further details.  I
             anticipate that he was engaged, at that time, in the  criminal
             activities which gave rise to his convictions in  March  2015.
             It is relevant  that  the  caution  did  not  deter  him  from
             continuing those criminal activities or  cause  him  to  cease
             them.  I take into account that the appellant himself sees his
             job prospects as limited.  That said, I accept the evidence of
             his wife that she would be able to return  to  work  when  her
             child is weaned and once her husband's immigration status  has
             been rectified.  Thus the family will have some income, albeit
             probably supplemented by state benefits, as now.  There  would
             thus be less incentive for the  appellant  to  commit  further
             offences.  I do not accept the appellant's  evidence  that  he
             has come to appreciate the impact of  his  criminal  behaviour
             and particularly his absence in prison on  his  children.   He
             now has a significant role in their care.  Whilst I accept the
             respondent's assertion that these were not victimless  crimes,
             they did not cause direct physical harm to any  victim.   They
             caused indirect financial harm.  They showed a  propensity  to
             flout the laws of this  country,  the  rule  of  law  being  a
             fundamental interest of society.  If the appellant were to re-
             offend the impact on society, particularly the taxpayer, would
             be financial; there would be no risk of serious physical  harm
             to any member of the public.


         67.  This is not a case where there is no risk of reoffending or of
             serious harm.  However, given the nature  of  the  appellant's
             crimes and the contemporaneous and  unchallenged  evidence  of
             his probation officer that there is a low risk of  reoffending
             and of serious harm (which is not inconsistent  with  that  in
             the OASys  report),  I  am  unable  to  find  the  appellant's
             personal  conduct   represents   a   'genuine,   present   and
             sufficiently serious threat affecting one of  the  fundamental
             interests of society', pursuant to  Regulation  21(5)(c).   In
             making this finding I bear in mind the  interests  of  society
             which the respondent cited in her reasons for her decision and
             which   were   reinforced   by   the   submissions   of    her
             representative.  I  do  not  doubt  that  the  activities  and
             conduct of the appellant  were  contrary  to  the  fundamental
             interests of society but, given the low risk of repetition and
             of serious harm, I am unable to find there  exists  a  genuine
             and present threat to those  interests,  irrespective  of  the
             requirement for that threat to be 'sufficiently serious'.   At
             best the threat could only be said to be a 'low' one.  I  take
             into  account  the  appellant's  personal  circumstances:  his
             family life in the UK,  his  recognition  of  the  detrimental
             impact of his  behaviour  (and  particularly  his  absence  in
             prison) on his three children and his wife who are  exercising
             their Treaty  rights  here,  the  length  of  the  appellant's
             residence (27 years), his degree of contact with his family in
             Morocco, his financial contribution to his family in  Morocco,
             his unchallenged integration into UK society as  a  result  of
             his length of residence and his relative  good  health  (there
             being no medical evidence to support his claim to suffer  from
             depression).  There is no suggestion of  a  risk  of  harm  to
             individuals physically or directly.  The risk of  harm  is  to
             the state and taxpayers  generally  in  that  it  arises  from
             potential further fraud.  Taking into account the low risk  of
             reoffending and the low risk of serious harm, I find that  the
             decision of the respondent cannot be justified on the  grounds
             of  public  policy  in  accordance  with  regulation  21.   In
             particular the decision has not bee taken in  accordance  with
             the principles in Regulation 21(5)(a) and (c)."

5.   The Secretary of  State's  grounds  seeking  permission  comprise  four
    bullet points and I shall refer to them as grounds 1 to  4.   Ground  1
    was not pursued by Mr Tufan, who conceded that he  was  at  a  loss  to
    understand why the ground had been drafted and reference made  to  Essa
    (EEA:   rehabilitation/integration)   [2013]   UKUT    00316    because
    rehabilitation was not an issue in this case.

6.   Ground 2 relates to a  letter  from  the  National  Probation  Service,
    specifically from a probation officer, Robert Shaw, on which the  judge
    relied (see [62]).  The ground argues that the letter does not  provide
    a direct answer to the relevant question that the judge had  to  answer
    because it was not drafted with Regulation 21(5)(c)  in  mind.   It  is
    also argued that the letter deals only with the likelihood of  physical
    threat in that low risk  of  serious  harm  is  concluded  following  a
    statement that the offence  committed  by  the  appellant  was  not  an
    offence of violence.  It is argued that the  judge  erred  because  low
    risk was assessed in the context of violent offending.

7.   Mr Tufan in oral submissions relied on the case of R v Benabbas  [2005]
    EWCA Crim 2113 with specific reference to paragraphs  14  and  46.   Mr
    Tufan in oral submissions indicated that it was  not  agreed  that  the
    appellant's partner had permanent residence.  However, he conceded that
    the judge concluded that she  had  permanent  residence  this  was  not
    challenged in the grounds seeking leave to appeal.

8.   The judge properly identified the relevant  issue  in  this  case.   At
    paragraph 31 she cited Regulation 21 and she then focused on Regulation
    21(5)(c) ("the personal conduct of the person concerned must  represent
    a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the
    fundamental interests of society").  The judge was only  too  aware  of
    the serious nature of the offences committed by the appellant.  She set
    the offences out in detail in the paragraphs quoted above.

9.   The appellant at the start of the hearing made an  application  for  an
    adjournment in order to obtain an up-to-date report in relation to  the
    risk of further offending.  This application was  refused.   The  judge
    had before her an OASys Report which was relatively historic and a more
    recent letter from the appellant's probation officer.  The  letter  was
    undated but the judge  concluded,  for  obvious  reasons  that  can  be
    inferred from the  content  of  the  letter,  that  it  post-dated  the
    appellant's release. The letter reads as follows;

         "On 6th June 2015 Mr Mennani was sentenced to a 16 month  custodial
         sentence for offences of Dishonesty.


         The circumstances of these offences is that between July  2000  and
         October 2010 Mr Mennani  claimed  Job  Seekers  Allowance,  Housing
         Benefit and Council Tax Benefit using a false name.


         Mr Mennani was released from custody in May 2016, probation records
         show that when he was initially released he was required to  report
         to the office weekly.  Our records show that he has  complied  with
         his Licence by reporting as instructed and has been engaged in  his
         supervision appointments.


         Mr Mennani has no previous convictions and the index offence is not
         a violent offence.  As a result of this he  has  been  assessed  as
         posing a low risk of serious harm and a low  risk  of  reoffending.
         Due to the low risk of serious harm and low risk of reoffending  Mr
         Mennani is assessed as posing the frequency of  his  reporting  has
         now been reduced to once every six weeks.


         Mr Mennani sentence end date is 01/10/2016 and after this  time  he
         will no longer be subject to probation supervision.


         If you require any further information please  contact  me  on  the
         number above."

10.  It is unarguable that the judge considered that this letter provided  a
    direct answer to Regulation 21(5)(c).  It was a matter  for  the  judge
    what weight to attach to the evidence. Albeit the letter was brief,  it
    was the most up to date piece of evidence save for the oral evidence of
    the appellant and his partner relating to the risk of reoffending.

11.  Having read the letter it is not arguable that the risk of  reoffending
    was assessed purely on the basis that the  offences  committed  by  the
    appellant were not offences of violence and it is unarguable  that  the
    judge focused on the threat of violence only.  She did not solely focus
    on the likelihood of a physical threat and to conclude otherwise  would
    involve a misreading of the decision of the judge.  It  is  clear  that
    she focused on other factors including the appellant's age, a  lack  of
    previous  convictions  and  her  findings   generally   and   I   refer
    specifically to paragraph 66 of the decision of the judge quoted above.

12.  The judge was well aware of the seriousness of the offences and  indeed
    made a number of adverse findings about the appellant's  conduct.   She
    did not proceed on the basis that there is no risk  of  reoffending  (I
    refer specifically to paragraph 67), but she was mindful  of  the  test
    that she had to apply.  She made an assessment based  on  the  evidence
    before her.  It is obvious that the letter from the  probation  officer
    was not written with Regulation 21(5)(c)  in  mind.   Nevertheless  the
    letter, containing conclusions reached  by  a  probation  officer  with
    direct dealings with the appellant, was a piece of  evidence  on  which
    the judge was entitled to rely.  The judge was wholly mindful that  the
    offences committed by the appellant are not victimless  and  there  was
    indeed some risk of reoffending and some risk of causing  serious  harm
    to the state and taxpayers. However, her task  was  to  apply  the  EEA
    Regulations as opposed to the immigration rules.

13.  In relation to the case of Benabbas this involved an appeal  against  a
    judge's recommendation to deport and it was not an appeal under the EEA
    Regulations.  The judge carried out a fact-sensitive assessment of  the
    appellant's conduct and I do not  see  how  paragraph  46  of  Benabbas
    assists the respondent's case. Ground 2 amounts to a disagreement  with
    the findings of the judge.

14.  Similarly grounds 3 and 4 are  an  attempt  to  reargue  the  case  and
    amount to a disagreement with the findings of  the  judge.   The  judge
    made a lawful and sustainable decision having had full  regard  to  the
    appropriate  test  and  paragraph  25  of  the  case   of   Straszewski
    C5/2014/1644:

         "In the present case the Secretary of State sought to  justify  Mr.
         Straszewski's deportation on serious grounds of  public  policy  or
         public security.  'Public policy' for these purposes  includes  the
         policy  which  is  reflected  in  the  interest  of  the  state  in
         protecting its citizens from violent crime and the theft  of  their
         property.   These  are  fundamental  interests   of   society   and
         therefore, although regulation 21(3) does not speak in terms of the
         risk of causing harm by future offending, in a case  of  this  kind
         that is the risk which the Secretary of State  is  called  upon  to
         assess when considering deportation.  That requires  an  evaluation
         to be made of the likelihood that the person concerned will  offend
         again and what the consequences are likely to be if  he  does.   In
         addition, the need for the  conduct  of  the  person  concerned  to
         represent a 'sufficiently serious' threat to one of the fundamental
         interests of society requires the  decision-maker  to  balance  the
         risk of future harm against the need to give effect to the right of
         free movement.  In any given case an evaluative  exercise  of  that
         kind may admit of more than one answer.  If so, provided  that  all
         appropriate factors have been  taken  into  account,  the  decision
         cannot be impugned unless it is  perverse  or  irrational,  in  the
         sense of falling outside the range of permissible decisions."

15.  The grounds do not establish that there is error  of  law.   The  judge
    made  findings  that  are  grounded  in  the  evidence  and  adequately
    reasoned.  She properly applied 21(5)(c) of  the  Regulations  and  had
    proper regard to relevant case law.  There is no error of law  and  the
    decision to allow the appeal is maintained.
