For the Appellant:     In person
For the Respondent:    Mr C Bates, a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan who was born on 2nd March  1984.
     He entered the United Kingdom with a Tier 4 Student Visa on 26th March
    2010, expiring on 30th October 2013.  He applied for and was refused an
    EEA residence card.  He then made  application  for  extension  of  his
    student visa, but that was refused on  26th  March  2014.   A  judicial
    review application was refused on 29th January 2015,  but  having  been
    given the opportunity to serve a One-Stop Notice, the appellant made an
    application for leave to remain on the basis of his human rights on  13
    October 2015.  His application was refused by the  respondent  on  10th
    February 2016, and the appellant appealed to the  First-tier  Tribunal.
    His appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Frankish at Stoke-on-
    Trent on 20th June 2017.

2.   The appellant heard oral evidence from  the  appellant  and  his  wife.
    When his leave expired in October 2013, the  appellant  was  cohabiting
    with a British citizen student, Lynn Gabriel Ewing ("the  spouse")  and
    he did not return with her to Pakistan, because he did not  believe  it
    to be safe for her to live there.  They were married on  23rd  February
    2013.  His wife is a citizen of Turks and  Caicos  and  is  a  pharmacy
    student at Liverpool John Moores  University,  hoping  to  graduate  in
    August of this year and currently undertaking  a  prequalifying  year's
    work.  The judge considered paragraph 276ADE and concluded  that  there
    would be no insurmountable obstacles to  the  appellant  returning  and
    integrating into the culture of his own country, but the real basis  of
    his case was that his wife would  not  wish  to  be  left  behind.   He
    considered EX.1 and EX.2.  The appellant claimed that  his  wife  would
    not  be  tolerated  in  Pakistan  which  would  in  effect  amount   to
    insurmountable obstacles.  Christians will not be tolerated in Pakistan
    and although he, as a Muslim, is entitled to marry a  Christian,  their
    offspring have to be brought up within the faith.  This  was  something
    the sponsor had acceded to.  The appellant also claimed that his family
    would not accept his spouse, but the judge said that as a grown man  if
    committed  to  his  marriage  he  should  not  be  discouraged  by  the
    disapproval of certain members of his extended family.

3.   The judge found that it was impossible to conclude in the terms of  the
    Rules  that  there  were  insurmountable  obstacles  to  the  appellant
    returning to Pakistan.  The judge accepted that there  were  obstacles,
    in that there would be a marital separation, but found that they  could
    be overcome by the appellant making a marriage  settlement  application
    once he could return to Pakistan.  Accommodation is  already  in  place
    and his spouse is currently supporting him as he is  not  permitted  to
    work.  She is currently earning just under �18,000 per annum  and  with
    part-time work could meet the �18,600 threshold.  The judge found  that
    there were not any insurmountable obstacles.   The  judge  went  on  to
    consider Section 117 and noted that the  appellant's  relationship  was
    established at a time when the appellant had limited leave to remain.

4.   Leave was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Chamberlain,  suggesting
    that it was arguable that the judge had not fully considered the return
    of both of them, since the judge refers to significant obstacles if the
    appellant were to return alone and make a settlement application.

5.   At the hearing before me, I explained to the appellant my  purpose  and
    also that unless I was satisfied there was a material error of  law  in
    the judge's determination, I was not permitted to  interfere  with  it.
    The appellant told me that he had had no relationships in Pakistan,  by
    which I believe he meant with females.  His parents  would  not  accept
    his marriage because he had married out of the  family  and  married  a
    Christian.  Were he to return to Pakistan, his family would prevent him
    from making an entry clearance application to come and join his wife in
    the United Kingdom.  He told me he was 32 years of age.  When  I  asked
    him how his family would prevent him and why he  could  not  return  to
    Pakistan without returning to the bosom of his  family,  the  appellant
    explained that it was a large family.  I told the appellant that I  was
    then going to hear from the Home Office after which I would invite  the
    appellant to address me again making any further comments he wished  to
    expand upon.
6.   The Presenting Officer said that it was clear that the  assertion  made
    before  the  judge  was  that  family  members  would  object  to   the
    appellant's spouse, because of the appellant's marriage to a  Christian
    woman.  However, the judge was correct in saying that Islam permits men
    (although not women) to marry outside their  faith,  subject  to  their
    offspring being brought up within the faith.  That was something  which
    the spouse had acceded to.  The judge was entitled to  have  regard  to
    the fact that Muslim men are permitted to  marry  women  outside  their
    faith.  The judge went on to note that the spouse is currently  earning
    approximately �18,000 and that there would be  obstacles  in  that  the
    appellant would  be  returning  to  Pakistan  on  his  own,  but  those
    obstacles could soon be overcome by making  an  application  for  entry
    clearance as a spouse.  His  wife  had  explained  that  she  hopes  to
    qualify this year but even if she  were  to  acquire  a  part-time  job
    bringing her salary up to �18,600 per annum such separation need not be
    for a long time.  There was no need for the appellant to take his  wife
    to Pakistan, because he would be able to apply for entry  clearance  as
    the spouse of someone  present  and  settled  in  the  United  Kingdom,
    provided her income was sufficient.

7.   I then told the appellant that he should confer with his  wife  to  see
    whether either of them had any comments to specifically  make  on  what
    the Presenting Officer had said.  I pointed out that I had received his
    witness  statement  which  was  dated  2nd  February  2018.   Mr  Bates
    confirmed he had a copy and I  read  it  aloud.   Having  done  so  the
    appellant told me that he had got nothing further to add since what  he
    wanted to say was already set out in the statement.

8.   I reserved my determination and explained that they  would  receive  my
    written decision shortly.

9.   I have concluded  that  there  is  no  error  of  law  in  the  judge's
    determination which is material to the outcome of the appeal.   Section
    EX.2 of the Immigration Rules refers to "insurmountable obstacles"  and
    says that they mean, "the very significant difficulties which would  be
    faced by the applicant  or  their  partner  in  continuing  their  life
    together outside the UK and which could not be overcome or would entail
    very serious hardship for the applicant or their partner."  It was  not
    suggested that the appellant's spouse should return with the  appellant
    to live in Pakistan, but I believe the judge was entitled to find  that
    the appellant could return to Pakistan  and  make  an  application  for
    entry clearance as the spouse of a person present and  settled  in  the
    United Kingdom.  That would involve some degree of  hardship,  in  that
    the parties would  be  separated  for  a  while,  but  the  appellant's
    spouse's income would, I was assured, increase  on  her  graduating  in
    August and in the  meantime  if  she  wished  to  take  some  part-time
    employment which took her  salary  above  the  level  of  �18,600,  the
    appellant could apply without waiting until his wife had graduated.  At
    the time of the hearing before the judge she was said to  be  about  to
    start her trainee pharmacy work at approximately �18,000 per annum  and
    as the judge said that would leave her with only an additional �600  to
    make up with part-time work in order to meet the threshold.  I  believe
    that the judge was entitled to find that that would not  amount  to  an
    insurmountable obstacle.

10.  I have  concluded  that  the  making  of  the  decision  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Frankish did not involve the making of an error on a point  of
    law.  The appellant's appeal is dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.
