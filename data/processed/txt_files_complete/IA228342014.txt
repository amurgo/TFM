                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 19th November 1991.   In
    May 2014 the Appellant's combined application for leave  to  remain  in
    the United Kingdom as a Tier 4  (General)  Student  Migrant  under  the
    points-based system was refused.  The Appellant appealed to the  First-
    tier Tribunal and the  appeal  came  before  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Dineen sitting at Hatton Cross  on  23rd  January  2015.   The
    Appellant's appeal was dismissed under both the Immigration  Rules  and
    human rights grounds.

 2. The Appellant lodged Grounds of Appeal to the Upper Tribunal and on 8th
    April 2015 Judge PJM Hollingworth granted permission to appeal  on  the
    basis that there was an arguable error of law in relation to the extent
    of the judge's consideration of whether there  would  be  a  breach  of
    Article 8.

 3. It was on that basis that  the  matter  came  before  me  to  determine
    whether there was a material error of law.   At  the  hearing  on  15th
    March 2016 there was no attendance by the Appellant and  the  Secretary
    of State appeared by her Home Office Presenting Officer Miss Johnstone.
      I  was  also  provided  with  correspondence  from  the   Appellant's
    instructed solicitors,  Pride  of  Hounslow,  advising  that  with  the
    consent of the Tribunal the appeal was to be withdrawn.

 4. Miss Johnstone indicates that she has no objection to this and pursuant
    to paragraph 17 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 I
    accept the withdrawal of this appeal.

Notice of Decision

The Appellant's appeal to the Upper Tribunal having been withdrawn  pursuant
to Regulation 17 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules  2008  the
