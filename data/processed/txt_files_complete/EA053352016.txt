For the Appellant:     Ms H Gore, instructed by R Spio & Co Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr P Singh, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born  on  18  January  1984.  She
    appeals against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Greasley
    promulgated on 31  January  2019  dismissing  her  appeal  against  the
    refusal of a residence card as an extended family member.

2.   On 10 June 2019, I found an error of law and set aside the decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal. The appeal was adjourned for rehearing  before
    the Upper Tribunal and the Appellant was directed to serve any  further
    evidence at least seven days before the hearing.  No  further  evidence
    has been  served.  The  Appellant  relied  on  a  bundle  of  documents
    containing  34  pages,  which  was  before  the  First-tier   Tribunal,
    including witness statements,  birth  certificates,  numerous  letters,
    payslips and photographs.


Oral Evidence

3.   The Appellant relied on a witness statement  dated  18  December  2018,
    which she signed in court. She told me she had  changed  address  since
    she made that statement and her new address was recorded on  the  court
    file. There were no further questions.

4.   In cross-examination, the Appellant confirmed she applied  for  a  visa
    to visit the UK in 2012 which was  refused.  She  then  made  a  second
    application to come to the UK with her husband for a  holiday  and  was
    granted a six-month visit visa. The Appellant did not travel to the  UK
    with her husband because she had an argument with him. Since coming  to
    the UK, the Appellant had little contact with her husband and had  been
    living with her auntie, the Sponsor. Her husband had abused her and she
    had a miscarriage. She called his parents and he was angry with her. He
    sent a letter about getting divorced in 2013.

5.   The Appellant was unable to give the name of  her  husband  when  first
    asked.  She said that he had three names, but  she  mostly  called  him
    [F]. She could not remember his second name, even though they had  been
    married for two years. He was not called [F] when she married  him  and
    he also had a nickname. Since the divorce she had not spoken to him and
    he had never visited her in the UK. She  started  a  relationship  with
    [EK] at the end of 2012 but stopped communicating with him  two  months
    ago. Their son was born in January 2016.

6.   The Appellant was convicted after a guilty plea of assault  occasioning
    actual bodily harm when she went to Mr  [EK]'s  home  and  got  into  a
    fight. The Appellant stated that prior to  this  separation  she  would
    stay with [EK] at his home for about a week in every month.  He  worked
    as a cleaner and a musician. He did not provide maintenance  for  their
    son. She had not married him.  He  had  not  seen  her  son  since  the
    incident leading to her conviction.

7.   When she first came to the UK, she lived  in  [~],  Southchurch  Court,
    [~]. She had lived there for about two or three years before she  moved
    to [~] Romford Road. She stayed there for a year then moved  to  McEwen
    Way, [~]. All three were council accommodation. The  Sponsor  had  been
    living with two other tenants in East Ham and one had moved  out.  They
    had lived in Romford Road when the Appellant was pregnant and then they
    moved to McEwen Way where the baby was born.

8.   The Appellant stated that she finished secondary school in Nigeria  and
    learned how to do hair. She did not  work.  Her  husband  worked  doing
    marketing for a company. He lived with his parents and she  lived  with
    them. They had a room in his parents' house.  The  Appellant  would  go
    back to her grandma's house  on  occasion.  Her  husband's  father  was
    working, but she did  not  know  what  he  did.  In  Nigeria,  she  was
    maintained by her husband and his parents and she lived in their house.
    She remained in contact with the Sponsor who  had  maintained  her  and
    paid her school fees when she lived with her grandma.  When  she  found
    someone she wanted to marry, she wanted to make things easier  for  the
    Sponsor, so she married and lived with her husband, whom she had  first
    known as [O], for two years. However, during the first three months  of
    the marriage she found out that her husband would  get  drunk  and  was
    abusive. He caused her to have a miscarriage and she had gone  back  to
    her grandma's. When the Appellant went to  Lagos,  she  found  out  her
    husband's name was [F]. The Appellant had been living with her  husband
    and his family before coming to the UK.

9.   The Sponsor would send �100  every  month  via  Western  Union  to  the
    Appellant's grandma, who would give the money to the Appellant and  her
    siblings. The Sponsor was still  sending  money  to  her  grandma.  The
    Sponsor never sent money directly to the Appellant in Nigeria.  It  was
    always sent to her grandma.

10.  The Appellant did not work in the UK and never had. The rent  from  the
    three properties in which she had lived was �1,100, �1,300  and  �1,200
    respectively and the bills were about �200. The Sponsor  worked  for  a
    cleaning agency. Her income was not really stable and she  also  wanted
    to study so she cleaned part-time. Her average income  was  �1,500  per
    month, sometimes it was �800 or �900, and then when she started working
    for the agency it went up to �1,200. The  Sponsor  gave  the  Appellant
    �100 or �150 every week. Sometimes the Appellant saved some  money  and
    helped pay the bills. She also received �20 child benefit a  week.  The
    Sponsor was able to afford to run the  household  from  the  money  she
    earned doing cleaning with an agency and some other jobs.

11.  When asked about why her name was on the water bill at McEwen Way,  the
    Appellant said that when she had made an application to the Home Office
    they had refused it, so she needed proof of address  to  confirm  where
    she was  living.  The  Sponsor  had  asked  for  a  bill  and  for  the
    Appellant's name to be on it. The Sponsor had said she  wanted  to  put
    the Appellant's name on one bill.

12.  When asked questions about proof of her relationship with the  Sponsor,
    the Appellant stated that they had been for a DNA test but it  did  not
    show anything. The Sponsor and the  Appellant's  mother  had  the  same
    mother but not the same father. The DNA test took place in 2017 but she
    could not remember the date and no copy of the test was produced.


13.  The Appellant was  still  in  contact  with  her  grandma  and  younger
    sister. She did not know she needed to obtain witness  statements  from
    them but she had asked about a birth certificate. She had been born  at
    home and did not have one, that is why she had obtained attestations of
    birth.  Her sister had in fact gone back to  the  council  and  done  a
    declaration. An affidavit was produced dated 8 October 2019.

14.  In answer to questions from me, the Appellant stated  that  the  credit
    in the bank statement from Joan Egbe in March 2014  was  her.  She  had
    been given money by the Sponsor and had  paid  it  into  her  grandma's
    account. She said there were no deposits directly from the Sponsor into
    grandma's account because most of the time  the  Sponsor  used  Western
    Union or asked some other family members to take money to  Nigeria.  In
    order to transfer from a UK account it had to be by  Western  Union.  I
    asked the Appellant about another payment in September 2011 in the name
    of Joan Omoregbe. She said that too was her. If she was given money she
    would send it to her grandma. She had used 'Ria' to send the money from
    the UK.

15.  In re-examination, she explained that she did not know why the  Sponsor
    did not use 'Ria'. She stated: "Ria is closer to me. If  I  don't  take
    her there she does not know."

16.  The Sponsor, [JO], gave evidence and confirmed  her  new  address.  Her
    witness statement was read out to her because she  could  not  remember
    having read it before the previous hearing. She confirmed  the  content
    of the statement and signed it in court.  She relied on  her  statement
    as evidence-in-chief.

17.  In cross-examination, the Sponsor could not remember  when  she  became
    an Italian citizen but confirmed that she came to the UK in  2006.  She
    had contact with the Appellant all the time before she came to  the  UK
    providing maintenance in Nigeria. She sent money  through  friends  who
    would give the money to her  mum,  the  Appellant's  grandma.  She  did
    transfer money by Western Union ten years ago but had not done so since
    2009 and had only sent money through friends. She was asked if she  had
    used 'Ria' and she said she had. She used it every  month  since  2009.
    When asked if the Appellant had sent money on  her  behalf,  she  said:
    "No, she does not have any." She confirmed that the Appellant  had  not
    sent money on her behalf and she did not know if the Appellant had used
    'Ria'. The Sponsor then stated: "If I had to send money, I  would  give
    her [the Appellant] money to send using my name." I asked  if  she  and
    the Appellant  ever  went  to  send  money  together,  she  said  "Yes,
    sometimes, sometimes no".

18.  The Sponsor confirmed that the Appellant was  married  in  Nigeria  and
    would come home to Benin from Lagos to grandma's  house  to  get  money
    that the Sponsor had sent. There was no record of  any  transfers  from
    the Sponsor to the Appellant's grandma via 'Ria'  because  the  Sponsor
    transferred money into her own account  in  Nigeria  and  then  it  was
    transferred to grandma's account. The  process  changed  four  or  five
    years ago and she now transferred money directly. When  asked  why  the
    Appellant had transferred  money  to  grandma's  account,  the  Sponsor
    stated that maybe when she sent money the Appellant  had  given  it  to
    grandma and also because the Appellant's sister was there as well.

19.  The Appellant did not work in the UK. The Sponsor was the  only  person
    working.  She earned about �1,000 a month, on average �1,200. Sometimes
    friends would give her money if she was broke. She  had  received  �400
    from a friend in the last six months.

20.  Since 2012, the Sponsor had lived at Southchurch Court,  Romford  Road,
    McEwen Way, Gresbrook Road and now Newport Avenue. When asked  how  she
    could afford to maintain herself she said she had help from friends who
    would also do some shopping as well. The friend who had  supported  her
    had not come to court because he was working and she had not obtained a
    witness statement from him because he did not put money in the bank, he
    gave it to her by hand.

21.  The Sponsor had met the Appellant's partner, [EK],  who  lived  in  the
    UK, but she had not seen him since the Appellant's  son's  birthday  in
    January. She had spoken to him last month on the  phone.  She  did  not
    think he saw his son and did not think he provided money for  his  son.
    The Sponsor confirmed that she gave the Appellant �30 to �40  per  week
    from her own pocket. She explained that the Appellant's name was on the
    water bill because she wanted her to have proof of address so  she  put
    her name on the bill to show that she lived in the same place. She just
    told the water company that the Appellant lived with her. When asked if
    the Appellant had any other income she said, "I  think  she  has  child
    benefit". There was no re-examination.


Respondent's Submissions

22.  Mr Singh relied on the refusal letter and  said  that  there  were  two
    issues: the claimed relationship and dependency prior  to  the  UK  and
    thereafter.  There  was  no  further  corroborative  evidence  of   the
    relationship. It could be assumed that the DNA test taken in  2017  was
    negative because the report had not been produced. The  affidavit  from
    the Appellant's sister, explaining the lack  of  a  birth  certificate,
    should be given little weight as it had been produced late in  the  day
    and the Appellant had not complied with directions.

23.  There was a lack of documentation of any transfers to the Appellant  in
    Nigeria. Mr Singh submitted that I should not accept the oral  evidence
    of the Appellant and the Sponsor because the water bill was  fabricated
    to enable the Appellant to remain in the  UK;  the  timelines  for  the
    addresses given by the Appellant and Sponsor were inconsistent; and the
    amount of rent was inconsistent.  The  Sponsor  did  not  know  of  any
    maintenance payments or  provisions  for  the  Appellant's  child.  The
    differences in rent and outgoings were significant.  The  discrepancies
    in maintenance and cost  of  living  meant  that,  on  the  balance  of
    probabilities,  the  Appellant  and  Sponsor  did  not  live  together.
    Further, there were many discrepancies in relation to  the  remittances
    sent to Nigeria. The Appellant said the  Sponsor  always  used  Western
    Union, not 'Ria', and the Sponsor said she stopped using Western  Union
    five to six years ago.

24.  Mr Singh submitted that there was a lack  of  documentary  evidence  in
    this case because the claim was fabricated. The Appellant said that she
    had paid money into her grandma's account in  2014  on  behalf  of  the
    Sponsor, but the Sponsor was not able to identify when  she  had  asked
    the Appellant to send any money. Even  if  it  was  accepted  that  the
    Sponsor sent money, it was sent to grandma. There was no evidence, oral
    or  documentary,  to  show  that  the  money  was  transferred  to  the
    Appellant. The Appellant could not show dependency prior to  coming  to
    the UK.  Further, two years prior to coming to the  UK,  the  Appellant
    was married and maintained by her husband and his family.  Even  though
    her marriage was turbulent it continued until the Appellant came to the
    UK.

25.  Mr Singh submitted it was not credible that the Sponsor  supported  the
    Appellant in the UK because her earnings were only sufficient to  cover
    the rent without any provision for the payment of  bills.  It  was  not
    possible for the Sponsor to provide any money  to  the  Appellant.  The
    Appellant was not financially dependent  on  the  Sponsor  because  she
    received child benefit.

26.  Mr Singh invited me to dismiss the appeal  because  the  Appellant  was
    not related to the Sponsor as claimed and there was  no  dependency  in
    Nigeria or in the UK. There was insufficient evidence to show that  the
    Appellant and Sponsor were members of the same household.


Appellant's Submissions

27.  Miss Gore submitted that there was  a  child  in  the  family  and  the
    Appellant's child and Sponsor  were  all  living  together.  The  birth
    certificate gave the child's address as [~]  McEwen  Way  which  showed
    that the Appellant and Sponsor were living together when the child  was
    born. The address was  the  same  on  the  PNC  and  on  various  other
    documents in the Appellant's bundle. The Appellant had  given  credible
    evidence because she had pleaded guilty to the offence  and  had  given
    evidence in relation to DNA testing, which did not assist her case. The
    fact that there were some discrepancies in dates and addresses was  not
    relevant. The Appellant also gave significant evidence that the Sponsor
    was not educated and required help with reading.  This  was  borne  out
    when the Sponsor's statement had to be read to her at the outset of the
    hearing. This indicated a closeness in the relationship  and  therefore
    explained why the Sponsor needed the Appellant's help to send money  to
    Nigeria. The Sponsor had given money to friends to take to Nigeria  and
    she also sent money via Western Union. She had been paying into her own
    account  which  was  then   forwarded   to   grandma's   account.   Any
    discrepancies were insignificant.

28.  When the Appellant's mother died  the  Sponsor  was  living  in  Italy.
    However, the  Sponsor  continued  to  fund  everybody  in  the  family.
    Although there was little  documentary  evidence  of  this,  there  was
    sufficient evidence given at the hearing that the Sponsor  was  funding
    the Appellant's education. There may  well  have  been  some  confusion
    about the money transfers, but the  Appellant  and  Sponsor  had  given
    consistent evidence about money being sent through  friends.  The  fact
    that the Appellant was receiving money from the Sponsor was  sufficient
    and how the money was sent was irrelevant.  The Appellant had  been  in
    an abusive relationship and was still supported by the Sponsor  because
    she kept returning to grandma's house. If I  found  the  Appellant  and
    Sponsor to be credible, the method of money transfers was not  crucial.



29.   Ms  Gore  submitted  this  case  turned  on  credibility  and  it  was
    unfortunate  that  there  was  insufficient  documentary  evidence   in
    support. There were, however, sufficient documents in addition  to  the
    water bill to show that the Appellant and Sponsor  lived  at  the  same
    address in the UK and receipt of child benefit was not relevant to  the
    assessment of dependency. The affidavit from the Appellant's sister did
    not add anything to the other documents. Miss Gore invited me to  allow
    the appeal.


Conclusions and Reasons

30.  The burden is on the Appellant to show that she was  a  member  of  the
    Sponsor's household prior to coming to the UK, or she was dependent  on
    the Sponsor prior to coming to the UK, and  she  is  a  member  of  the
    Sponsor's household in the UK, or dependent on the Sponsor in the UK.

31.  I do not find the Appellant  to  be  a  credible  witness  because  her
    account was inconsistent with the account given by the Sponsor and  was
    not supported by documentary evidence which the Appellant ought to have
    been able to produce if her account was true.  There  were  significant
    discrepancies in the Appellant's account in relation to how  money  was
    sent to Nigeria, how much money the Sponsor gave the Appellant and  the
    properties in which they lived in the UK.

32.  I do not find the Sponsor to be a credible witness because her  account
    was inconsistent with the Appellant's in relation to where  they  lived
    and for how long, the amount of rent, the method of money transfer  and
    how the Sponsor was able to afford to support the Appellant, given that
    her claimed income was only sufficient  to  cover  the  rent.  Further,
    there was no documentary evidence to support the Sponsor's  claim  that
    she transferred money into her own account in Nigeria.

33.  I find that the Appellant is unable to show that she was  a  member  of
    the Sponsor's household prior to coming to the UK. Her evidence,  taken
    at its highest, was that two years before she came to the UK she  lived
    with her husband and his family in Lagos and she returned to  Benin  on
    occasion to visit her grandma and escape from her abusive husband.  She
    accepted in oral evidence that she lived  and  was  maintained  by  her
    husband and his family for two years prior to coming to the UK in 2012.
    The Sponsor came to the UK in 2006.  On the  evidence  before  me,  the
    Appellant has failed to establish membership of the Sponsor's household
    prior to coming to the UK.

34.  The Appellant has also failed to show dependency on the  Sponsor  prior
    to coming to the UK because she has accepted that she was maintained by
    her husband and his parents. While she may well have gone back  to  her
    grandma's house on occasion, there was very little evidence to  support
    her claim that she was given money sent by the Sponsor. The Appellant's
    evidence was that the Sponsor would send money by  Western  Union.  The
    Sponsor's evidence was that she had not sent money by Western Union for
    the last ten years and that she would send money to her bank account in
    Nigeria and it would be transferred into grandma's  bank  account.  The
    bank statement of the Appellant's grandma showed no transfers from  the
    Sponsor.

35.  The explanation for the two payments  made  by  the  Appellant  to  her
    grandma was  not  credible.  The  Sponsor  initially  stated  that  the
    Appellant had not sent money on her behalf, but later stated  that  the
    Appellant would send money in the Sponsor's name.  The  Appellant  said
    that she was given money by the Sponsor to pay into  grandma's  account
    and she had transferred the money using 'Ria'. The Sponsor used Western
    Union not 'Ria'. The Sponsor's evidence  was  that  she  had  not  used
    Western Union for ten years and had started using  'Ria'  five  or  six
    years ago. She sometimes made  the  payments  with  the  Appellant  and
    sometimes on her own. The  Sponsor  now  made  payments  directly.  The
    Appellant's evidence was that the Sponsor  needed  help  to  make  such
    payments.

36.  There was no documentary evidence to show that the Sponsor  transferred
    money into her own account in Nigeria and then it  was  transferred  to
    grandma's account. This lack of evidence undermines the Sponsor's claim
    to be supporting the Appellant in Nigeria prior to her arrival  in  the
    UK. This is evidence the Sponsor ought to be able be able to produce if
    her account was true. The Sponsor's credibility is  further  undermined
    by the significant discrepancies in the account she gave as to how  she
    transferred money to Nigeria and the account the Appellant gave in oral
    evidence.

37.  I do not find the Appellant's claim  to  have  been  dependent  on  the
    Sponsor prior to coming to the UK to be credible. The two accounts were
    entirely inconsistent and were not supported by  documentary  evidence.
    The failure to prove this element of the Appellant's claim is fatal  to
    the application and the appeal is dismissed on that basis.

38.  In relation to the  other  matters,  it  may  well  be  that  there  is
    sufficient documentary evidence to support the oral evidence  that  the
    Sponsor and the Appellant lived at [~] McEwen Way with the  Appellant's
    child. However, there was insufficient  documentary  evidence  to  show
    that they had lived at the  other  addresses  claimed  and  their  oral
    evidence was inconsistent  in  relation  to  the  time  spent  at  each
    address. If the Appellant was a member of the  Sponsor's  household  it
    was for a brief period whilst they lived at McEwen Way.




39.  Further the Appellant cannot show dependency on the Sponsor in the  UK.
    Her evidence was  that  she  received  �100  to  �150  per  week.   The
    Sponsor's evidence was that she gave her �30 to �40 a week. It is clear
    from the Sponsor's income and  outgoings  that  she  could  not  afford
    either of those amounts. The Appellant has failed to show dependency in
    the UK.

40.   In  relation  to  the  claimed  relationship  there  were   no   birth
    certificates but attestations of birth dated 2015. Whilst I accept that
    it was rare for births to be registered, I attach little weight to  the
    attestations of birth produced many years later. Further, there was  no
    DNA evidence to show the relationship claimed. The Appellant  disclosed
    that she had obtained a DNA test in 2017 but said the  result  was  not
    conclusive, therefore she had not produced it. I infer from the failure
    to  produce  such  evidence  that  it  did  not  support  the   claimed
    relationship. I am not satisfied  on  the  totality  of  the  evidence,
    including the Appellant's oral evidence, that she  is  related  to  the
    Sponsor as  claimed.  I  find  that  the  Appellant  and  Sponsor  have
    fabricated their accounts to support this application.  Accordingly,  I
    dismiss the Appellant's appeal.
