For the Respondent:    Ms Willocks-Briscoe, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. In a decision promulgated on 29 August 2018 I set aside the decision of
    the First-tier Tribunal.  I now remake that decision.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria, born on 14 May 1970, who
    divorced his EEA national wife in May 2015.

 3. On 12 October 2015 the appellant applied for a residence card as
    confirmation of a retained right of residence following a divorce under
    the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006 ("the 2006 Regulations").  His
    application was refused on 17 March 2016 because he was unable to show,
    as required under Regulation 10(5)(a) of the 2006 Regulations, that his
    former wife was exercising Treaty Rights when the marriage terminated.



 4. The appellant has not produced any independent evidence to show that
    his former wife was exercising Treaty Rights when they divorced in
    2015.  The only documents he submitted are a payslip dated 26 February
    2010 and a letter from an employer dated 20 April 2010.  The documents
    are clearly irrelevant as they are from five years before the divorce.
    The employment status of the appellant's wife in 2010 cannot
    conceivably tell me anything about whether she was exercising Treaty
    Rights in 2015.

 5. In my decision of 29 August 2018 I directed the respondent to obtain
    from HMRC documents showing the tax paid and national insurance
    contributions made, if any, by the appellant's former wife.  HMRC duly
    undertook the enquiries at the request of the respondent.

 6. The evidence from HMRC is set out in two witness statements by an HMRC
    employee named Mr Lewis.  He stated that HMRC were unable to locate any
    evidence of the appellant's ex-wife's employment in the UK.  The second
    of his two statements states that the National Insurance number given
    on the payslip dated 26 February 2010 does not match that of the
    appellant's ex-wife and in fact relates to a male living in the
    Midlands area.

 7. Mr Shah argued that I should not draw any negative inference from the
    statements of Mr Lewis as there could have been an error by the
    appellant's ex-wife or her accountant in respect of the 2010 payslip
    and the search carried out by HMRC may have been inadequate because the
    last known address of the appellant's former wife was not used.  He
    also sought to rely on the fact that a resident's permit for the
    appellant was issued in October 2010.

 8. Despite HMRC having undertaken enquiries, the appellant has been unable
    to provide any independent or documentary evidence to show that his
    former wife was exercising Treaty Rights when they divorced in 2015.
    The only documents before me are from 2010 (five years before the
    relevant date) and are therefore irrelevant.  The appellant has not
    established that the requirements of Regulation 10(5) of the 2006
    Regulations are satisfied. His appeal is therefore dismissed.
