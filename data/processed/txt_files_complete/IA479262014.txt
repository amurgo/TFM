                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction
1. I have considered whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  an
   anonymity direction.  No  anonymity  direction  was  made  previously  in
   respect of this Appellant. Having considered all  the  circumstances  and
   evidence I do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.
2. This is an appeal by the Appellant against  the  decision  of  First-tier
   Tribunal Judge Edwards promulgated on 10 March  2015.  He  dismissed  the
   Appellant's appeal against a refusal of a Residence Card as  confirmation
   of her right to reside in the United Kingdom as a dependent family member
   under the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 ('the EEA
   Regulations') of the sponsor  who  is  a  Portuguese  citizen  exercising
   treaty rights in the United Kingdom.  .
Background


3. The Appellant was  born  on  27  December  1986  and  is  a  national  of
   Pakistan.
4. 8 December 2010 the Appellant's parents made  an  application  for  entry
   clearance to the United Kingdom as family members of the  sponsor  Faisal
   Saeed their son a Portuguese  citizen  exercising  treaty  rights.  Their
   application was refused on the basis only that a false document had  been
   produced. Their appeal against refusal was allowed on 18 August 2011 at a
   hearing before First -tier Tribunal Judge Davies.
5. On 11 May 2012 the Appellant entered the  United  Kingdom  as  a  Tier  4
   (General) Student with leave valid from 22 April 2012 until  12  November
   2014.
6. 11 June 2014 the Respondent curtailed the Appellant's leave  because  her
   college was de registered.
7. 21 August 2014 the Appellant made the application subject of  the  appeal
   before First-tier Tribunal Judge Edwards.
8. On 13 the Secretary of State refused the Appellant's application  on  the
   basis that:
   a) There was insufficient evidence that  the  Appellant  was  related  as
      claimed to Faisal Saeed.
   b) There was insufficient evidence that she was dependent on the  Sponsor
      either prior to coming to the United Kingdom or since she had  entered
      the United Kingdom or that  she  has  been  or  is  a  member  of  his
      household.


The Judge's Decision
9. The Appellant appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal.  First-tier  Tribunal
   Judge Edwards ("the Judge") dismissed the appeal against the Respondent's
   decision. The Judge found;
   a) The Appellant was not part of the Sponsors household  before  arriving
      in the United Kingdom.
   b) The remittances sent to Pakistan helped with the family  expenses  and
      improved their material conditions but did not establish dependency.
   c) The Appellant therefore did not meet Regulation 8(2) (a) and 8(2) (c).
   d) He also found that being in the United Kingdom as a student  envisages
      a return to the home country and therefore the Appellant could not  be
      a member of a household.
10. Grounds of appeal were lodged arguing that  in  essence  the  Judge  had
   applied the wrong version of the EEA Regulations and failed to take  into
   account the Immigration (EEA) (Amendment)(No2) Regulations  2012  removed
   the requirement that the Appellant resides in the country  in  which  the
   EEA national also resides in order to be a dependent; the Judge also took
   into account an irrelevant fact, that the Appellant  was  a  student,  in
   order to determine an EEA case.

11. On 2 June 2015 First-tier Tribunal Judge  Hollingworth  gave  permission
   to appeal.

12. At the hearing I heard submissions from Mr Marrington on behalf  of  the
   Appellant that :

   a) He relied on his skeleton argument at pages 121-124 of the bundle.

   b) The refusal letter set out the correct version of the Regulations  but
      the Judge used the wrong version.

   c) The Judge therefore failed to consider whether the Appellant could  be
      a member of the sponsor's household when they were not living  in  the
      same country

   d) The Judge also rules out the possibility of being an  extended  family
      member where the Appellant was here on another  basis,  as  a  student
      under the Immigration Rules.

   e) The Judge failed to address the argument advanced that as an unmarried
      Muslim woman she is the dependent of someone. Her parents came to  the
      United Kingdom in 2011 as the dependents of her brother the Sponsor so
      how could she be dependent on anyone other than her brother.

   f) There was no clear finding as to whether she was now dependent on  her
      brother the sponsor.

   g) He was content for the decision to be  remade  on  the  basis  of  the
      papers before me.

13. On behalf of the Respondent  Mr Harrison submitted that :

   a) He relied on the Rule 24 response.

   b) He had to concede that the Judge had applied the wrong version of  the
      Regulations and therefore the decision he made must be suspect.

   c) He did suggest there were question marks in relation to the chronology
      which  might  suggest  that  the  findings   about   dependency   were
      sustainable.

Legal Framework

14. Regulation 8 of the EEA Regulations 2006 was amended by the  Immigration
   (EEA) (Amendment)(No2) Regulations 2012 by removing the requirement  that
   the appellant resides in the country  in  which  the  EEA  national  also
   resides and now reads:
"Extended family member"
8.-(1) In these Regulations "extended family member" means a person  who  is
not a family member of an EEA national under regulation 7(1)(a), (b) or  (c)
and who satisfies the conditions in paragraph (2), (3), (4) or (5).
(2) A person satisfies the condition in this paragraph if the  person  is  a
relative of an EEA national, his spouse or his civil partner and-
(a) the person is residing in a country other than the  United  Kingdom  and
is dependent upon the EEA national or is a member of his household;
(b) the person satisfied the condition in paragraph (a) and is  accompanying
the EEA national to the United Kingdom or wishes to join him there; or
(c) the person satisfied the condition in paragraph (a), has joined the  EEA
national in the United Kingdom and continues to be dependent upon him or  to
be a member of his household."



15. In relation to the issuing  of  a  residence  card  to  extended  family
   members the  Regulations provide at 17(4)-(5):
   "(4) The Secretary of State may issue a residence  card  to  an  extended
   family member not falling within  regulation  7(3)  who  is  not  an  EEA
   national on application if-
   (a) the relevant EEA national in relation to the extended  family  member
   is a qualified person or an  EEA  national  with  a  permanent  right  of
   residence under regulation 15; and
   (b) in all the  circumstances  it  appears  to  the  Secretary  of  State
   appropriate to issue the residence card.
   (5) Where the Secretary of State receives an application under  paragraph
   (4)  he  shall  undertake  an  extensive  examination  of  the   personal
   circumstances of the applicant and if he refuses  the  application  shall
   give reasons justifying the  refusal  unless  this  is  contrary  to  the
   interests of national security"

16. In relation to the definition of dependency I take into account   Moneke
   (EEA - OFMs) Nigeria [2011] UKUT 00341(IAC) where the  Tribunal  accepted
   that the definition of dependency was accurately captured by the  current
   UKBA ECIs which read as follows at ch.5.12: "In determining if  a  family
   member  or  extended  family  member  is  dependent   (i.e.   financially
   dependent) on the relevant EEA national  for  the  purposes  of  the  EEA
   Regulations: Financial dependency should be interpreted as  meaning  that
   the person needs financial support from the  EEA  national  or  his/  her
   spouse/civil partner in order to meet his/her essential needs  -  not  in
   order to have a certain level of income. Provided a person would  not  be
   able to meet his/her essential living needs without the financial support
   of the  EEA  national,  s/he  should  be  considered  dependent  on  that
   national. In those circumstances, it does not matter that  the  applicant
   may in addition receive financial support / income  from  other  sources.
   There is no need to determine the reasons for recourse to  the  financial
   support provided by the EEA national or to consider whether the applicant
   is able to support him/herself by taking up paid employment.  The  person
   does not need to be living or have lived in an EEA state  which  the  EEA
   national sponsor also lives or has lived." At paragraph 42  the  Tribunal
   went on "We of course accept (and as the ECIs  reflect)  that  dependency
   does not have to be "necessary" in the sense of  the  Immigration  Rules,
   that is to say an  able  bodied  person  who  chooses  to  rely  for  his
   essential needs on material support of the sponsor may be entitled to  do
   so even if he could meet those needs from his or her economic activity."




Finding on Material Error

17. Having heard  those  submissions  I  reached  the  conclusion  that  the
   Tribunal made material errors of law.

18. I am satisfied that the Judge made findings in this case in relation  to
   what he understood were the relevant issues based on an incorrect version
   of the Regulations. This error I consider to be material  since  had  the
   Tribunal applied the correct version of the Regulations the outcome could
   have been different. That in my view is the correct test to apply.

19. I therefore found that errors of law have been established and that  the
   Judge's determination cannot stand and must be set aside in its  entirety
   to be remade. Mr Marrington indicated that  he  was  content  for  me  to
   remake the decision on the basis of the evidence placed before the First-
   tier Tribunal and the consolidated bundle that he had prepared  for  this
   hearing. He would not have sought to call any additional evidence.

Remaking the Decision

20. The Appellant is a single 28 year old national  of  Pakistan.  I  accept
   that the Appellant arrived in the United Kingdom on 11 May 2012 as a Tier
   4 Student with  valid  leave  until  12  November  2014  .Her  leave  was
   curtailed on 11 June 2014 and she applied for a  residence  card  as  the
   extended family member of her brother Faisal Saeed a  Portuguese  citizen
   who I am satisfied has  been  exercising  treaty  rights  in  the  United
   Kingdom as a worker since 2006 .Mr Saeed acquired a  right  of  permanent
   residence in 2010.

21. It was recognised in Dauhoo (EEA Regulations - reg 8(2)) [2012] UKUT  79
   (IAC) that  under  the  scheme  set  out  in  Regulation  8  (2)  of  the
   Immigration (European Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006,  a  person  can
   succeed in establishing that he or she is an "extended family member"  in
   any one of four different ways, each of which requires proving a relevant
   connection both prior to arrival in the UK and in the United Kingdom  and
   while the  Regulations  have  been  amended  since  this  decision  I  am
   satisfied that the principle of meeting the Regulation in these different
   ways survives the amendment.

22. I have therefore started by considering whether  there  is  evidence  of
   pre arrival dependency in Pakistan given the  number  of  money  transfer
   receipts in the Appellant's bundle.  I  accept  that  the  Appellant  was
   living with her parents at an address in Lahore prior to  coming  to  the
   United Kingdom as the same address appears for both her and  her  parents
   in the money transfer receipts that are found in the bundle.

23. I am satisfied that prior to the arrival of the Appellant's  parents  in
   the UK to live with their son there is  abundant  evidence  of  financial
   support from Mr Saeed the his father at pages 87-11  of  the  Appellant's
   bundle: the sums sent are regular and certainly in 2010  and  2011  there
   are monthly remittances of between �100 and �250 which in the context  of
   living in Pakistan are not insubstantial sums. At that time I accept that
   the Appellant was living with  her  parents  as  is  common  with  single
   unmarried women in Pakistan and she  was  supported  by  the  money  they
   received from their son. I note that all of the remittances  during  that
   period, a period when she was living with her  parents,  the  remittances
   were made out to her father. I accept that given that she was living with
   them they supported her financially with the money sent from the  Sponsor
   and therefore the reality of the situation was  that  the  whole  of  his
   family in Pakistan were dependent on Mr Saeed the Sponsor in the UK.

24.  While  there  is  little  documentary  evidence  of  what  part   these
   remittances played in relation to  the  family  finances  in  Pakistan  I
   accept that the  Respondent  must  have  accepted  that  the  Appellant's
   parents were as a matter of fact dependents of their son as the  decision
   of First-tier tribunal Judge Davies of 18 August 2011 makes clear that in
   allowing the appeal  against  a  refusal  of  a  family  permit  for  the
   Appellant's parents the only issue in the case  was  the  validity  of  a
   birth certificate, dependency was not in issue.  The  Judge  allowed  the
   appeal and the Appellant's parents came to live with the sponsor  at  his
   home in the United Kingdom as dependent family members.

25. Following the success of their appeal the Appellant's  parents  came  to
   live in the United Kingdom. The fact that the Appellant continued  to  be
   dependent on her brother receives support in my view from the  fact  that
   from the end of 2011 the remittances, in the same significant  sums,  are
   then made payable to the Appellant rather than her father  as  previously
   up until the point where she came to the UK in May 2012.

26. On arrival in the United Kingdom the Appellant came  to  live  with  her
   brother the sponsor and her parents at the Sponsors home address as there
   are a number of documents with that show they all share the same address.
   I note that her father died in 2013 but she  continued  to  live  at  the
   sponsors address I have not been directed to any caselaw or provision  of
   the Regulations that suggests that the fact that the Appellant came as  a
   student under the Immigration Rules prevents her from being a  member  of
   her sponsors household for the  purpose  of  meeting  the  definition  of
   extended family member.

27. I am satisfied that  I  am  not  required  to  find  prior  and  present
   connection to the EEA sponsor but it does not have  to  be  in  the  same
   capacity and in this case i am satisfied that prior to  her  arrival  the
   Appellant was a dependent  of  the  sponsor  but  upon  her  arrival  the
   evidence is clearer that she is a member  of  his  household:  I  do  not
   exclude the possibility of her also being financially  dependent  in  the
   United Kingdom the evidence is simply less clear.

28. Given that the issue of a residence card is  discretionary  my  findings
   of fact are made in the knowledge that the decision will have  to  revert
   to the Respondent for a lawful decision.

Decision

29. There was an error on a point of law in the decision of  the  First-tier
   Tribunal such that the decision is set aside

30. I remake the appeal.

31. I allow the appeal under the EEA Regulations to the limited extent  that
   it is remitted to the Respondent for a lawful decision to be made.
