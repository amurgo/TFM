Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Stefan Kotas, Senior Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals, with permission, against a decision of Judge  of
    the First-tier Tribunal Davidson who, in a determination promulgated on
    18 May 2018, dismissed the appellant's appeal against the refusal of an
    application for leave to remain on human rights grounds.

 2. The appellant is a national of Nigeria who was born in  February  1960.
    She frequently visited Britain, entering last on 30  April  2005  as  a
    visitor, and thereafter overstayed.  Her human rights  application  was
    made in February 2016.  The judge heard evidence  from  the  appellant,
    her nephew's wife, her sister-in-law and her  brothers  and  noted  the
    appellant's evidence which was that she was aged 45 when  she  came  to
    Britain in 2005.  She said that she had  attempted  to  regularise  her
    stay seven years later but no application was actually  made.  She  had
    been  apprehended  by  Immigration  Officers  in  2015  and  made   the
    application the refusal of which is the subject of this appeal in 2016.
     The appellant's evidence was that she lived with her brother  and  his
    wife and she had another brother, sister, nephews and nieces and  their
    spouses in Britain.

 3. In Nigeria she has a husband, from whom  she  is  estranged  and  three
    children aged 26, 25 and 17 who all live together.   Her  26  year  old
    daughter works as a lawyer in a law  firm,  her  25  year  old  son  is
    unemployed and her 17 year  old  had  just  gone  to  university.   The
    appellant's evidence was that she had worked as a  chef  in  a  nursing
    home in Belfast but she was not currently working but was supported  by
    her relations.  She asserted  that  Nigeria  was  a  dangerous  country
    ravaged by terrorists and militant activities and  that  she  would  be
    unable to sustain herself there because Nigeria was very expensive  and
    although her family here gave her ï¿½300 per  month  that  would  not  be
    sufficient to support her.

4.   The appellant's brother's evidence  asserted  that  the  appellant  had
    been maltreated in an unhappy marriage in Nigeria and  there  would  be
    nobody to support her there.  It  appears  that  one  of  her  brothers
    travels to Nigeria quite often.

5.   In paragraphs 32 onwards of the determination the  judge  set  out  his
    findings of fact and relevant law referring to  Rule  278ADE(1)(vi)  of
    the Rules and Section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum
    Act. He concluded that the appellant could not meet the requirements of
    the  Rules.   He  considered  that  in  Nigeria  she  could  still   be
    economically active and could find work.  He placed weight on the  fact
    that she  had  overstayed  and  that  she  could  never  have  had  any
    expectation of being able to stay in the  United  Kingdom  permanently:
    she had no leave to remain after  her  visit  visa  had  expired.    He
    stated that he had not taken into account representations regarding the
    threat of kidnap and terrorism in Nigeria but pointed out that this was
    not an asylum claim.

6.   The grounds of appeal asserted firstly that the judge had  not  made  a
    step by step consideration of the appellant's rights under Article 8 as
    set out in Razgar [2004] 2 AC  368  and  furthermore  stated  that  the
    decision was not compatible with Article 8 as the judge had  failed  to
    apply Section 117B to the determination.  The grounds asserted that the
    judge had not followed the  approach  laid  down  in  his  judgment  in
    Rhuppiah [2016] EWCA Civ 803 by  Sales  LJ  who  had  stated  that  the
    starting point in consideration of the proper construction of  part  5A
    of the 2002  Act  was  that  Sections  117A  -  117D,  taken  together,
    identified a structured approach to the application of Article 8  which
    produces in all cases a final result which is compatible with  and  not
    in violation of Article 8.

7.   Before the hearing Ms Price had  submitted  a  skeleton  argument.   It
    argued  that  the  judge  had  not  properly  taken  into  account  the
    appellant's private life here and that he had not properly  weighed  up
    the public interest against that claimed private life. She argued  that
    there were two important factors to be given weight  in  the  balancing
    exercises, which were the ability of the applicant to speak English and
    to be financially independent so as not to be a burden  on  the  public
    purse.  She pointed that that argument had swayed Judge of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Grant-Hutchinson when she granted permission  to  appeal.
    The grounds of appeal  referred  to  ten  certificates  of  higher  and
    further  education,  a  bundle  showing  the  advanced  level  of   the
    appellant's English sufficiency and she argued that these  showed  that
    the appellant would not be a burden on public funds because  she  would
    be able to obtain work here.  Moreover, it was argued  that  there  was
    evidence that there was civil unrest in Nigeria and she said that  that
    should be taken into account.  The judge had  not  properly  considered
    whether or not there would be unjustifiably harsh circumstances for the
    appellant being removed to Nigeria.  A number of cases were cited which
    referred to the discretion which should be used in Article 8 cases.

8.   Ms Price stated that the judge had not properly exercised his  judgment
    in considering the appellant's circumstances and  moreover  that  there
    was in Nigeria the threat of kidnap - she referred  to  the  government
    guidelines on travel to Nigeria which referred to violent crime  there.
    Moreover, she pointed out the appellant's husband  was  estranged  from
    her.

Discussion

9.   I consider that there is no material error of law in the  determination
    of the Immigration Judge.  The judge was entitled to  place  weight  on
    the fact that the appellant's private life had been built up at a  time
    when she did not have leave to remain in Britain.  The  fact  that  the
    appellant speaks English and has certain qualifications are not factors
    which could weigh in favour of the appellant when assessing her  rights
    under Article 8 of the ECHR.   That  is  clear  from  the  judgment  in
    Rhuppiah to which the grounds of appeal referred. However, the relevant
    guidance is in paragraphs 59, 61, 62 and 63 of the judgment.  There  it
    is clearly stated that the ability to speak English and  indeed  to  be
    financially self-sufficient or not requiring state assistance  were  at
    best neural factors in an Article 8 assessment.

10.  Moreover, although I accept that the  background  documentation  refers
    to unrest in Nigeria or to levels of crime there, there is  nothing  to
    indicate that there would be a reasonable likelihood of this  appellant
    suffering kidnap or being the  victim  of  a  crime  in  Nigeria.   The
    reality is that she can return to Nigeria - a country  which  she  left
    when she was aged 45 and where she  was  clearly  well  integrated  and
    where she has three children  who  all  live  together.   There  is  no
    indication that she could not be supported there, particularly  if  she
    has additional resources from her family here.  It may well be that she
    is estranged from her husband but that does not mean  that  she  cannot
    return.  Indeed, the reality is that the various  qualifications  which
    she has obtained would stand her in good stead  on  return.   There  is
    simply  nothing  to  indicate  that  it  would   be   unreasonable   or
    disproportionate to expect her to return to Nigeria.

11.  Accordingly, I consider that there is no material error of law  in  the
    determination of the Immigration Judge and that his decision to dismiss
    this appeal shall stand.
