Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms J Isherwood (Home Office Presenting Officer)
For the Claimant: Mr G Franco (Counsel instructed by Veja & co solicitors)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This matter comes before me as a resumed hearing following an error  of
    law decision and reasons promulgated on 13 June 2016.  The Secretary of
    State on behalf of the Entry Clearance Officer in Islamabad appealed on
    the grounds that the First-tier Tribunal ("FTT") erred in  law  in  its
    consideration of evidence under Appendix FM-SE.   I  found  a  material
    error of law in the decision and reasons which was set  aside  and  the
    claimant's appeal under the Rules dismissed.  Article 8  ECHR  remained
    to be determined and directions were made for the matter to be relisted
    for consideration of Article 8 outside of the Rules.

Application for an Adjournment

2.   Mr Franco applied for an adjournment on the grounds that  he  had  been
    instructed the day before at 4 o clock and that the  claimant  had  not
    produced evidence pursuant to the directions made at the error  of  law
    hearing.  The claimant had given birth to a child some five months  ago
    by way of caesarean section and was in hospital in Kabul and  currently
    receiving medical treatment.  It was likely that the relative with whom
    she was living would be moving to Turkey on a permanent basis.

3.   Ms Isherwood relied on SS  (Congo)  and  Others  [2015]  EWCA  Civ  387
    arguing that the Tribunal was only able to take into  account  evidence
    as  at  the  date  of  decision  given  this  was  an  entry  clearance
    application.

Decision Re Adjournment

4.   I refused the application for  an  adjournment.   The  sponsor  was  in
    attendance at the hearing and would be able to give relevant  evidence.
    The parties had been informed of the Tribunal's decision and directions
    at the hearing on 24 May 2016 and had been sent a copy of the  relevant
    decision and reasons promulgated on 13 June 2016.   I  considered  that
    the claimant had adequate time in which to  prepare  evidence  for  the
    resumed hearing with regard to Article  8  issues.   Whilst  Mr  Franco
    indicated that reliance  was  placed  on  Gurung  as  regards  relevant
    evidence for entry clearance cases, he subsequently confirmed  that  no
    reliance was placed on this decision in respect of that issue.

Evidence of Mr S Sayed

5.   The sponsor gave evidence and confirmed that he was living and  working
    in Oxford as at the date of the  application  for  entry  clearance  in
    2014.  He married the claimant in September 2013 in Kabul.  At the time
    the application was  made  there  was  no  child  of  the  family.   He
    travelled to Kabul and visited her.  She was living with his uncle.  He
    provided her with financial support on a monthly  basis  and  they  had
    communicated regularly over the phone.  He established private life  in
    the UK by working here and planned to set up his own business and  take
    a business degree.  He was a British citizen as  was  his  father.   He
    resided in the UK for some twelve years.  He visited Afghanistan on  an
    annual basis to see his wife.  He visited for a holiday before they got
    married.  Kunar was his home area which is an area in which the Taliban
    are based.  He would not be able to relocate to Afghanistan because  of
    security reasons and  there  was  an  increased  chance  of  his  being
    kidnapped as a British citizen.  He would not be able to live in  Kabul
    as he did not speak Pashtu and would therefore be unable to get a  job.
    He confirmed that women were not treated as equals in Afghanistan.

6.   In cross-examination the sponsor confirmed that he visited  Afghanistan
    on three occasions between 2007 and 2014 and he stayed  in  Kabul.   On
    one occasion his visit was for a period of two  months.   He  generally
    stayed indoors but would venture  out  if  accompanied  by  friends  or
    relatives.  He obtained British citizenship in 2006/7 and  returned  to
    Afghanistan some six years later in 2012.  He visited  regularly  since
    he married.  Other members  of  his  family  in  the  UK  visited  less
    frequently.  His mother went to Afghanistan for a wedding and when  her
    mother died.  The sponsor has siblings in the UK.  The sponsor and  the
    appellant arranged for their wedding to be in Afghanistan in accordance
    with their customs.  The sponsor did not look into whether  or  not  he
    would be able to obtain entry clearance for the claimant as a  fiancï¿½e.



7.   In response to a question asking what compelling circumstances  existed
    in October  2014  to  justify  consideration  outside  the  Rules?  The
    claimant failed to meet the Rules for  entry  clearance.   The  sponsor
    stated he would not be able to work in Afghanistan.  The  claimant  was
    unsafe there. He did not speak the appropriate dialect.  He  played  an
    important role in family life in the UK.  He obtained employment in the
    UK at Tesco's from October 2014.  He was  not  working  for  Marks  and
    Spencers at the time of the entry clearance application.   He  accepted
    that this fact had not been recorded in his witness statement.  He  did
    not accept that at the time of the application  he  did  not  meet  the
    financial requirements under the rules.

8.   In re-examination Mr  Franco  raised  a  question  in  respect  of  new
    evidence produced from HMRC arguing that the income from Tesco's  would
    establish that the sponsor earned  sufficient  to  meet  the  financial
    threshold.  He acknowledged however that this  was  not  evidence  that
    could be taken into account as it amounted to new evidence.

Submissions

9.   Ms Isherwood  submitted  that  were  it  appropriate  to  consider  the
    financial evidence now  relied  on  by  the  sponsor,  it  nevertheless
    remained the position that there was no reliable evidence to show  that
    the claimant met the financial requirements.  There was no evidence  to
    show  that  there  were  any  compelling   circumstances   to   justify
    consideration of Article 8 outside of the Rules.  The sponsor  and  his
    family members were happy to  return  to  Afghanistan  for  significant
    periods of time.  In the event that the claimant  could  not  meet  the
    financial requirements there would be public interest concerns in terms
    of  recourse  to  public  funds.   Family  life  could  be  carried  on
    elsewhere.  The sponsor was a British citizen but he returned regularly
    to see the claimant in Afghanistan and so family life has continued.  A
    near miss does not amount to a compelling circumstance.   The  claimant
    should consider making a fresh application.

10.  Mr Franco submitted that the sponsor was working in the UK.   He  would
    lose his employment and income and be unable to  exercise  his  private
    life in the UK.  He was a British national.  He married in  Afghanistan
    and his understanding was that he had to apply for a visit visa for the
    claimant as his wife.  He was only able to live a limited life in Kabul
    and had to be accompanied by others because of security concerns.   The
    claimant was not seeking to reopen issues previously determined but  Mr
    Franco argued that he wished to reframe his argument that the  evidence
    produced was capable of establishing that  the  financial  requirements
    were met, but acknowledging that there would have to  be  some  further
    calculation and adjustment as to details of income earned in the letter
    dated 18 May from HMRC.  He relied on a near miss argument.

11.   Ms  Isherwood  made  an  additional  submission  in  response  to  the
    submissions as regards financial  evidence.   She  submitted  that  the
    further evidence from HMRC dated 18 May 2016 was not reliable  and  the
    sponsor was not credible as regards his employment.   The  letter  from
    HMRC showed no income received from Oxford City Link Limited which  had
    formed  the  basis  of  his  financial  evidence  in  support  of   the
    application.

12.  At the end of the hearing I reserved my decision which I now give  with
    my reasons.

Discussion and Decision

13.  The basic principles and approach to dealing with Article 8  issues  in
    entry clearance cases have been established in SS  (Congo)  and  Others
    from [39]-[42].  The court concluded that

         "The appropriate general formulation for this category is that such
         cases will arise where an applicant for leave  to  enter  can  show
         that compelling circumstances exist  (which  are  not  sufficiently
         recognised under the new  Rules)  to  require  the  grant  of  such
         leave."

14.  As at the date of the application and at the date of the  decision  the
    Claimant had not had  a  child  and  her  circumstances  were  entirely
    different from those at present.  As regards the Rules I find that  the
    claimant  failed  to  adduce  reliable  evidence  that  the   financial
    requirements under the Rules were met. This matter  was  determined  at
    the error of law hearing and the appeal dismissed under the Immigration
    Rules.  Whilst Mr  Franco  sought  to  "reframe"  his  arguments  I  am
    satisfied that this amounted to an endeavour on his part  to  introduce
    new evidence that had not formed  the  basis  of  any  argument  before
    either the First-tier Tribunal or before the Upper  Tribunal  error  of
    law hearing.  In any event I find that the evidence fails to show  that
    the financial requirements are met as was acknowledged by Mr Franco who
    ultimately sought to rely on a near miss argument.

15.  In terms of the Article 8 issue I find no evidence to show  that  there
    are compelling circumstances  which  are  not  sufficiently  recognised
    under the Rules to require the grant of leave to enter.  The sponsor is
    a British citizen and he has been able to maintain family life  to  the
    extent that he has visited Afghanistan regularly in circumstances where
    he was aware that there was no  expectation  that  his  wife  could  be
    granted entry clearance into the UK.  The current  circumstances  where
    there is now a child of  the  family  are  adequately  covered  by  the
    Immigration Rules and accordingly it is open to the claimant to make  a
    fresh application for entry clearance.

16.  I  find  no  evidence  to  show  compelling  circumstances  to  justify
    consideration of Article 8 outside of the  Rules  as  at  the  date  of
    decision.  In the alternative if I am wrong I find  that  there  is  no
    breach of Article  8  as  the  sponsor  has  been  able  to  return  to
    Afghanistan and maintain some form of family life  through  visits  and
    contact with the claimant.  There is a public  interest  issue  to  the
    extent that the financial requirements have  not  been  met  under  the
    Rules and therefore there would  be  recourse  to  public  funds.   The
    sponsor on behalf of the claimant has adduced financial evidence  on  a
    piecemeal basis and ultimately I find that this  cannot  be  relied  on
    when considering the evidence as  a  whole.   I  find  that  there  are
    contradictions  and/or  discrepancies  as  to  where  the  sponsor  was
    working, how long he was working for and there is inconsistency in  the
    evidence of his personal finances and that more recently obtained  from
    HMRC.
