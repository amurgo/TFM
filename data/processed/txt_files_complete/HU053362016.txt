Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr D Balroop, Counsel, instructed by 12 Bridge
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is a challenge by the Appellant against the decision of First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Scott-Baker ("the judge"), promulgated on 23  May  2018,
    by which she dismissed his appeal against the Respondent's decision  of
    13 January 2016, which in turn had refused  an  application  for  entry
    clearance (a deemed human rights claim).

 2. The Appellant, a citizen of Nepal, had applied to join  her  mother  in
    this country.  The Appellant is the adult daughter of a  former  Gurkha
    soldier, who passed away in 2009.  The sponsor had  applied  for  entry
    clearance at the same time  as  the  Appellant.   Both  relied  on  the
    Respondent's policy guidance.  The sponsor's  application  was  granted
    and she came to this country in 2016, leaving the Appellant behind.




The judge's decision

 3. At [45] the judge concludes that the Appellant could  not  satisfy  the
    various requirements of Annex K to the Respondent's policy guidance and
    this conclusion has not been challenged.

 4. The judge goes on to make the following relevant findings of fact:

      i) The Appellant had lived together with the sponsor in a family  home
         prior to the latter's departure in 2016;

     ii) The Appellant continued to live in the family home along with three
         of her brothers;

    iii) The sponsor had been sending  money  back  to  her  children  on  a
         regular basis and this money was used for all of their benefit;

     iv) That the brothers may have been able to contribute to the household
         income and that the Appellant may have been able to obtain work  in
         the local area;

      v) That the sponsor had "willingly"  chosen  to  come  to  the  United
         Kingdom when she did;

     vi) That the level of contact between the Appellant and sponsor was not
         as significant as has been claimed.

 5. The  judge  concluded  that  the  Appellant  was  not  financially  and
    emotionally dependent on the sponsor [53].  It is then said,  at  least
    implicitly, that there was no family life.

 6. The judge goes on to consider the issue of proportionality  (given  the
    apparent finding on the  family  life  issue,  this  was  not  strictly
    necessary).  She concluded that although the historic  injustice  point
    was relevant, the critical issue was the inability of the Appellant  to
    show that Article 8 was engaged in the first  place.   The  appeal  was
    therefore dismissed.



The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

 7. The grounds of appeal set out a number of favourable findings  of  fact
    and go on to say that in light of these and the  guidance  provided  by
    the Court of Appeal in Rai [2017] EWCA Civ 320 the judge was  wrong  to
    have found that there was no family life between the Appellant and  the
    sponsor.  It was also said that the judge was wrong to  have  concluded
    that, if family life had existed, the decision of  the  Respondent  was
    proportionate in any event.

 8. Permission to appeal was refused by the First-tier  Tribunal  but  then
    granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Allen on 4 January 2019.




The hearing before me

 9. Mr Balroop relied on the grounds of appeal and submitted that the judge
    erred in her approach to the financial issue and the sponsor's "choice"
    in leaving Nepal.  He placed emphasis on the guidance stated in Rai.

10. Mr Tufan accepted that the judge had erred in respect of  the  "choice"
    and financial support issues.  She had failed to ask the right question
    in light of Rai and had speculated on whether the Appellant's  brothers
    were able to contribute to the household income.  He acknowledged  that
    if family life had been found to exist the judge was wrong  in  respect
    of her proportionality conclusions and that the  Appellant  would  have
    been entitled to succeed in her appeal.




Decision on error of law

11. As I announced to the parties at the hearing, I conclude that the judge
    did materially err in  law.   My  reasons  for  so  concluding  are  as
    follows.

12. The core issue of family life had to be assessed in light of the  well-
    known Kugathas framework, but also the guidance provided by  the  Court
    of Appeal in Gurung [2013] EWCA Civ 8 and, more recently, Rai.

13. At [63] and [65] the  judge  had  accepted  that  family  life  existed
    between the Appellant and sponsor whilst they were both living together
    in Nepal.  The question was whether this family life had been  "broken"
    by the sponsor's departure in 2016 or had  otherwise  ceased  to  exist
    over the passage of time since that departure and up until the date  of
    hearing.

14.  The  judge  did  accept  that  the  sponsor  was  providing  financial
    assistance to the Appellant and her three brothers.   In  my  view  she
    then erred in failing to address the  issue  of  whether  or  not  that
    financial assistance  showed  "real"  or  "committed"  support  to  the
    Appellant (and indeed her brothers).  That was the test to  be  applied
    (see, for example, paragraph 40 of Rai).   It  was  not  necessarily  a
    question of the Appellant being wholly financially dependent  upon  the
    sponsor.

15. Further,  as  Mr  Tufan  has  accepted,  the  judge  engaged  in  undue
    speculation as to the possibility of the brothers providing a financial
    contribution to the household income.  Neither representative were able
    to point me to any evidence in support  of  this  conclusion.   Similar
    speculation was involved in the conclusion  that  the  Appellant  might
    herself be able to find work.  In my view, the judge was bound to  have
    based her assessment on the evidence before her and the facts as  found
    relating to the situation as at the date of hearing.

16. The second error relates to the judge's  reliance  upon  the  sponsor's
    willingness to have left the Appellant back in Nepal when she  came  to
    the United Kingdom in 2016.  We know from  Rai  that  the  question  of
    whether a parent exercises a "free choice" is to be treated  with  real
    caution.  In particular, parents issued with  entry  clearance  had  to
    "activate" that by coming to the  United  Kingdom  sooner  rather  than
    later.  This is precisely what occurred in the  present  case.   Having
    regard to paragraphs 38-42 of Rai , I conclude that the judge erred  by
    placing material reliance upon this issue.

17. In respect of emotional dependency, the judge was entitled to find that
    there had been a degree of exaggeration as  to  the  level  of  contact
    between the Appellant and sponsor.  However, the two errors  identified
    above render the overall conclusion on the issue of family life  to  be
    unsound.

18. The errors in respect of the family life issue are clearly material  to
    the outcome of the appeal as a whole.  This is in part  because  of  Mr
    Tufan's concession, but also because the judge herself stated  in  [73]
    that the "critical" factor in her assessment under Article 8(2) was the
    fact that in her view Article 8 had  not  been  engaged  in  the  first
    instance.

19. In light of the above I set the judge's decision aside.




Remaking the decision

20. Both representatives were agreed that I could  and  should  remake  the
    decision in this appeal based on the evidence now before  me.   This  I
    now do.

21. Based upon that evidence as a whole, the judge's unchallenged findings,
    and the position adopted by Mr Turfan, I make the following findings of
    fact.

22. The Appellant and sponsor lived together in a family home up until  the
    departure of the latter from Nepal in 2016.  I find that  during  their
    cohabitation the Appellant was dependent upon both of her parents  and,
    after the death of her father in 2009, upon the sponsor alone.  I  find
    as a fact that there was family life.

23. I find that the sponsor applied for both herself and the  Appellant  in
    2015 for entry clearance to come to the United Kingdom.   This  clearly
    indicated an intention for that part of the family to remain united and
    to travel to this country together.  The decision of the sponsor to  in
    fact leave Nepal after the grant of entry clearance did not represent a
    "free choice" in any real sensible understanding of that term.  I  find
    that she had to come to this country in order to take advantage of  the
    entry clearance and the right to settle here, a right which  arose  out
    of the recognition of the historic injustice done to Gurkhas and  their
    families over the course of time.

24. I find that the sponsor has sent money back to the  Appellant  and  her
    siblings on a regular basis over the course of time.  The  amounts  may
    not be particularly large, but I have regard to the sponsor's means and
    find they represent a fairly significant amount of her own  income.   I
    agree with Judge Scott-Baker that the money  was  not  purely  for  the
    benefit of the Appellant, but also went to assist  her  three  brothers
    with whom I find she continues to live in the family home.

25. However, I find that the  financial  assistance  is  an  important  and
    necessary element  of  the  household  income.   Indeed,  there  is  no
    evidential basis for me to conclude that there was other  money  coming
    in from any form of employment.  It is clear to me that  the  sponsor's
    remittances constituted "real" and "committed"  financial  support  for
    the Appellant.  The same would probably apply to the three brothers  as
    well.

26. Albeit by a relatively narrow  margin,  I  also  find  that  there  has
    continued to be  an  emotional  dependency  by  the  Appellant  on  the
    sponsor.  I accept that there has not been as  much  contact  as  might
    otherwise have been the case, but given the fact of the cohabitation up
    until 2016, the financial assistance thereafter, and the fact that  the
    Appellant is the only daughter of the sponsor, it is more  likely  than
    not that there has been a requisite level of dependency  beyond  normal
    ties.  I note in this regard that Mr Tufan has not sought to  argue  to
    the contrary.

27. This is a case in which there may not be any  exceptional  features  of
    the dependency, but that is not of course the test (see paragraph 36 of
    Rai).

28. Overall I find  that  there  is  continuing  family  life  between  the
    Appellant and sponsor.

29. Moving straight on to  the  issue  of  proportionality,  Mr  Tufan  has
    conceded that in  the  particular  circumstances  of  this  appeal  the
    historic  injustice  issue  outweighs  the  important  public  interest
    consideration  of  effective  immigration   control   (as   these   are
    represented within section 117B of the NIAA 2002).

30. In light of this properly made concession and the various  authorities,
    I conclude  that  the  Respondent's  decision  was  a  disproportionate
    interference with the Appellant's family life  and  therefore  unlawful
    under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.




Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains material errors of law  and
I set it aside.

I re-make the decision in this appeal by determining that  the  Respondent's
refusal of the Appellant's human rights claim was unlawful under  section  6
of the Human Rights Act 1998.

I therefore allow the Appellant's appeal.

No anonymity direction is made.
