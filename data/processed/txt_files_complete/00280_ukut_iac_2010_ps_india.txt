Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr A Mahmood, Counsel, instructed by UKIC
                    Immigration Lawyers
For the Respondent:    Ms J Isherwood, Home Office Presenting Officer


(1)   There is no single, proper test  to  be  applied  when  assessing  the
    adequacy of maintenance in a working holidaymaker appeal.

(2)    The  onus  is  on  the  appellant  to  show  that  he  can  meet  the
    requirements of para95(v) of HC395. It is for him to explain his  plans
    and how  he  proposes  to  maintain  and  accommodate  himself  without
    recourse to public funds.

(3)   Whether those proposals are practical  can  be  assessed  against  any
    reliable evidence of the likely costs subject to ensuring that  a  true
    comparison can be made.  However, any such evidence is a guide only and
    cannot be treated in  itself  as  determinative  or  as  displacing  or
    putting a gloss on the wording of the rule itself.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    This is an appeal  by  the  appellant  against  the  determination  of
    Immigration Judge Lowe issued on 14 April 2009  dismissing  his  appeal
    against the respondent's decision to refuse him entry  clearance  as  a
    working holidaymaker.  Reconsideration was ordered by  the  High  Court
    and on 11 January 2010 the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  found  that
    the judge  had  materially  erred  in  law.   The  reconsideration  now
    proceeds by virtue of transitional provisions as an appeal to the Upper
    Tribunal.  The factual  issue  which  remains  unresolved  between  the
    parties is whether the appellant is able to meet  the  maintenance  and
    accommodation requirements of para 95 of HC 395.  A more general  issue
    of principle has been raised, both by the Immigration Judge and by  the
    Senior Immigration Judge at the first stage of the reconsideration,  as
    to the proper test to be applied when making his assessment.

Background

2.    The appellant is a citizen of India born  on  15  April  1988  and  he
    lives with his family in the village of Pandori Ran Singh in  Amritsar.
    On 22 January  2008  he  applied  for  entry  clearance  as  a  working
    holidaymaker.  In his application he said that he assisted  his  father
    in the family agriculture business and the total  family  income  after
    tax was Rs1,20,000.  He intended to stay in the UK for two years for an
    extended holiday and would take work incidental  to  that  holiday  for
    less than twelve months.  He set out his holiday plans and said that he
    would take �500 with him and would be maintained  and  accommodated  by
    his brother-in-law, the sponsor.

3.    However, the respondent was  not  satisfied  that  the  appellant  had
    shown that he could meet all  the  requirements  of  para  95  for  the
    following reasons:

           "Although I accept that your age makes you eligible to apply for
         a working holiday visa, you must also show me that you  will  leave
         the UK at the end of your working holiday and  that  you  will  not
         take up permanent work.


           You state that you are currently working, assisting your  father
         in your family's agricultural business  since  August  2006.   Your
         presence here is clearly not essential given that you are  able  to
         travel to the UK for an up to two year working holiday.


           Because of this I  am  not  satisfied  that  you  are  genuinely
         seeking entry to the UK as a working holidaymaker, that you plan to
         leave the UK at the end of your working holiday or that you plan to
         do only temporary work which is incidental to a holiday  (paragraph
         95(vi)(viii) of HC 395).


           You state that you have �500 (about Rs40,000) available for your
         trip.  You have not provided satisfactory evidence that such  funds
         will actually be available to you or that it is credible  for  your
         family to deplete their savings to fund an extended holiday by you.
          You have not explained or shown that it is realistic  for  you  to
         spend such funds on a  working  holiday.   The  costs  involved  in
         spending two years in the United Kingdom  on  a  two  year  working
         holiday  will  be   considerable.    Taking   into   account   your
         circumstances and experience in India, I am not satisfied that your
         earning potential in the UK would be sufficient to  enable  you  to
         support yourself for two years if you were not to  take  employment
         that was only incidental to a holiday and for not more than  twelve
         months.  You have not provided satisfactory evidence as to how  you
         will be able to support yourself during  this  period.   I  am  not
         satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that you will  be  able
         to maintain and accommodate yourself in the UK without recourse  to
         public funds or without taking employment other than that which  is
         incidental to a holiday (paragraph 95(v)(vi) of HC 395).


         Although I accept that you may not have firm plans for the  future,
         you must show that you plan to leave the UK  at  the  end  of  your
         working holiday.  Because you  have  not  shown  me  any  realistic
         future plans, I am not satisfied that you plan to leave the  UK  at
         the end of your stay (paragraph 95(viii) of HC 395).


        I        therefore        refuse         your         application."



4.    At the hearing before the immigration  judge  the  sponsor  gave  oral
    evidence.  He confirmed that he had offered the  appellant  hospitality
    for an initial week or so and also whenever he  returned  to  the  West
    Midlands during his holiday.  He said that this  was  optional  as  the
    appellant had underlined that he  wished  to  be  self-sufficient.   He
    lived with his parents and elder brother and helped his father  on  the
    farm which would continue to be run by the appellant's father who could
    hire labourers.  As the appellant worked for his  father,  he  took  no
    wages and so in return his father had given him  funds  for  the  trip.
    The sponsor had also made him a gift  of  �1,000.   He  said  that  the
    appellant's family had earned a good living from the farm  for  a  long
    time and the value of  their  land  was  increasing  so  there  was  no
    question that the expenditure on the trip would  affect  their  overall
    financial position.  The appellant would have about �2,800 to spend  in
    the UK and would do no more than twelve  months'  incidental  unskilled
    work.   The  sponsor  said  that  he  was  a  transport  driver  making
    deliveries to large construction  companies.   He  had  made  enquiries
    about labouring jobs for the appellant and had  been  told  that  there
    were always concrete laying  jobs  going  at  the  minimum  wage.   The
    appellant would be able to improve his  English.   He  could  work  for
    maybe three days and then go sightseeing for the other four days  in  a
    week.  He would take him to see local sights but the appellant had also
    mentioned living in London and Glasgow.

The Findings of the Immigration Judge

5.    The judge dealt with the points in the respondent's decision in  turn.
     She commented that the  refusal  appeared  to  doubt  the  appellant's
    employment status in India because he could be released from the family
    farm for up to two years as he was "not essential" thus adding  to  the
    respondent's suspicions about the appellant's  personal  and  financial
    circumstances and whether he intended to work in the UK  in  breach  of
    the scheme.  She  said  that  the  scheme  was  a  "gap  year  type  of
    opportunity for those who had yet to establish themselves in their home
    country" and that there was no requirement that  an  appellant  had  to
    have been working in his home country, have a job to return to or  even
    have settled plans for the future.  She found that the  respondent  had
    made a mistake in his assertion that the appellant had initial funds of
    only �500 accepting from the evidence before  her  that  he  had  about
    �2,800 in funds under his control derived  from  gifts.   She  accepted
    that he intended to work  as  required  by  the  case  of  NS  (Working
    holidaymaker; intention to work) India [2007] UKAIT 00090) [2007] UKAIT
    00090 and that his sponsors had modified  their  offer  of  hospitality
    from two years to an initial period  in  the  UK  followed  by  ad  hoc
    accommodation.  She found that the appellant appeared to be aiming  for
    realistic work such as labouring where  the  sponsor  had  been  making
    enquiries.  There was no reason to suppose that  a  20  year  old  man,
    physically fit from working on a farm and  used  to  hard  manual  work
    would not be able to get this type of job.

6.    At the hearing the  appellant's  representative  produced  a  list  of
    places which could be visited for free in the London area but the judge
    that she did not attach much weight to this as it appeared to be  post-
    refusal and contained places which did not have any obvious  attraction
    to a working holidaymaker like the  appellant.   Rather  more  relevant
    evidence  was  produced  about  the  cost  of  hostel   and   dormitory
    accommodation to support an argument that realistically  the  appellant
    need only pay about �5 per night to accommodate himself.  It was argued
    on behalf of the appellant that the income support  rates  provided  an
    appropriate benchmark for the assessment of whether he  could  maintain
    himself.

7.    The judge considered the determination in TS  (Working  Holidaymakers:
    no third party support) India) [2008] UKAIT 00024  where  the  Tribunal
    had held that an appellant had to show that he could meet the costs  of
    the holiday from a combination of his own financial resources  and  his
    earnings from incidental employment and that he would not be able to do
    so if he had to rely either in  whole  or  in  part  upon  promises  of
    financial support from third parties whether family, friends or  others
    to meet his maintenance or his accommodation  needs.   In  MH  (Working
    Holidaymaker: intention to support) Bangladesh [2008] UKAIT  00039  the
    Tribunal held that so far as accommodation was concerned, an  offer  of
    hospitality was not necessarily fatal on third  party  support  grounds
    but the appellant still had to be in the position of being able to show
    that if any proposed hospitality did not materialise or came to an end,
    he would be able to maintain and accommodate himself.

8.    The judge was referred to the guidance set out  in  the  relevant  IDI
    April 2004 and in the Entry  Clearance  Guidance  (General)  Directions
    Chapter 18, 18.4 to the effect that any working  holidaymaker  must  be
    able to satisfy the ECO that he has the means to support himself for at
    least the first two months after arrival or for at least one  month  if
    he has a job arranged in advance. She rightly made the point that  this
    guidance could not override the provision of the rules.   She  accepted
    that the appellant would have �2,800 in initial funds and would be able
    to work.   If he worked a 40 hour week for 52  weeks  at  the  national
    minimum wage, he could earn about �9,700 net and therefore the  maximum
    that he would have available for his holiday would be in the region  of
    �12,500.  On this basis, over a period  of  two  years,  the  appellant
    would need about �120 per week to support himself.

9.    She commented that the respondent normally used the figures  given  in
    the Lonely Planet Guide for the UK as the benchmark for  assessing  how
    much it would cost a  working  holidaymaker  to  maintain  and  support
    himself.  The provincial rate for a "shoestring" traveller for food and
    accommodation alone would be �25 a  day  and  on  this  basis,  without
    taking into  account  any  travel  or  discretionary  expenditure,  the
    appellant would need �18,250 for a two year  stay  or  about  �175  per
    week.

10.   It was argued on the appellant's behalf that the income support  rates
    with accommodation costs added provided a  better  benchmark  than  the
    Lonely Planet Guide.   The  income  support  rates  were  used  as  the
    benchmark for assessing the  adequacy  of  maintenance  for  a  married
    couple and it could hardly be the  case,  so  it  was  argued,  that  a
    working holidaymaker would in reality need more resources when  showing
    that he could maintain  and  accommodate  himself  when  there  was  no
    requirement of adequacy in para 95.

11.   The judge set out her findings on these issues as follows:

         "24.     I  take  the  view  that   using   income   support   plus
             accommodation costs as a benchmark is not valid for a  working
             holidaymaker, who is by definition doing some work and  having
             an extended holiday.  The recipient of this subsistence  level
             allowance is someone usually living at home who is  definitely
             not a tourist or holidaymaker, and is  incurring  only  living
             expenses and perhaps travel expenses to job  interviews.   The
             case of KA is not therefore applicable.  Whilst  it  would  be
             helpful to have judicial confirmation of  the  formula  to  be
             used (albeit on a defunct scheme) the working holidaymaker has
             to be regarded  as  someone  who  will  in  pursuit  of  their
             extended holiday incur board and lodging expenses not in their
             own home, travel costs and sightseeing expenses even if travel
             passes and free entries are to be used as  much  as  possible.
             Not all free schemes would cater for a working  holidaymaker's
             needs  or  interests,  so   some   tourism   and   socialising
             expenditure has to be expected, including entrance fees to the
             theme parks and major tourist  attractions  mentioned  by  the
             appellant.  As it is an extended holiday, there has to be some
             expenditure on toiletries  and  discretionary  items  such  as
             clothing to meet changing seasons, and costs arising from  the
             limited opportunity to  cook  one's  own  meals.   If  the  TS
             determination quoted without disapproval 2006 daily  costs  of
             �30-�60 in the provinces, �25 per day at the date  of  refusal
             in  2008  does  not  seem  unreasonable.   The  appellant   is
             therefore short of about �5,750 to fund his  working  holiday,
             on the basis of funds, likely employment and costs as  at  the
             date of refusal.


         25.     I appreciate  that  the  appellant  and  sponsors  will  be
             disappointed by this decision.   However,  the  appellant  may
             wish to consider applying for a family visa as this would give
             him up to six months of staying with his sister and brother-in-
             law, and going sightseeing.  Providing a family visit to  them
             is intended, there is nothing in the Immigration Rules to stop
             the appellant from doing some touring and sightseeing  on  his
             own.  He would not be able to work, but he would  be  able  to
             meet people and improve his English through conversation.  His
             father is apparently willing for him to take time off from the
             farm, and he has savings to fund his trip."


    For     these     reasons      the      appeal      was      dismissed.



The Grounds

12.    The  grounds  seek  to  challenge  the  judge's  finding   that   the
    appellant's financial requirements fell short by  �5,750.   They  argue
    that the judge was wrong not to take proper account of the guidance  in
    the IDI and to proceed on  the  basis  that  the  working  holidaymaker
    scheme required  an  appellant  to  have  all  the  necessary  finances
    available in advance and and would need the level of resources set  out
    in the Lonely Planet Guide.  The rules did not require maintenance  and
    accommodation to be adequate and the grounds repeat the  argument  that
    the income support figures provide a  more  appropriate  guideline  for
    assessing whether the requirements of the Rules are met.

The Material Error of Law

13.   The Tribunal (Senior Immigration Judge Freeman) found that  the  judge
    had erred in law for the following reasons:

     a) This is a working holiday-maker appeal, in  which  HH  Judge  David
        Pearl, sitting as  a  deputy  judge  of  the  High  Court,  granted
        reconsideration on the basis that the immigration judge's  decision
        was challenged over what she said about third party  support.  This
        was in fact not the case, as the appellant's  solicitor  Mr  Thomas
        made clear before me: the appellant argued that he would be able to
        pay his own way, not only by the money he would bring with him, but
        by what he would earn in this country. (Probably  Judge  Pearl  was
        misled by the incidental reference to the question of  third  party
        support in the grounds for review).

     b) The judge seems to have accepted that the appellant would have been
        able to bring the equivalent of �2,800 with him. So far as  earning
        capacity goes, she accepted (at paragraph 17) that he could  get  a
        labouring job in this country; but there was nothing apart from the
        fact that his uncle had made some inquiries to  show  any  specific
        prospects of that. Mr Thomas argued that  he  should  be  taken  as
        having the capacity to earn the equivalent of the national  minimum
        wage at 40 hours a week for  12  months,  which  he  calculated  as
        �12,376.


     c) I do not think this was necessarily the conclusion the judge should
        have drawn from  her  findings;  but  these  certainly  included  a
        finding that the appellant did have some earning capacity, and that
        figure no doubt represents the maximum that could  reasonably  have
        been attributed to it; so the judge's round figure  of  �12,500  on
        that basis is not wrong in law, in the absence of any challenge  to
        it by the Home Office in a r. 30 reply. That  brings  the  relevant
        finding on the appellant's resources for his  two-year  stay  to  a
        total of �14,300.

     d) The problem with the judge's  reasons  for  dismissing  the  appeal
        comes with her use of the 'Lonely Planet'  guidelines.  This  well-
        known work of reference for travellers  is  often  cited  by  entry
        clearance officers, and use of it has  passed  without  comment  in
        various decided cases. Though Mr Smart  for  the  Home  Office  was
        undoubtedly right in pointing to the Court of Appeal's  calculation
        of resources in KS (India) [2009] EWCA  Civ  762  as  covering  the
        whole of the two-year period, that is not the length of  stay  with
        which the 'Lonely Planet' is dealing.

     e) Clearly someone who is here for that length of  time  will  have  a
        cheaper daily cost of living than  a  short-term  visitor.  On  the
        other hand, the expenses he will have to meet, even on the notional
        basis that he will  be  living  as  a  self-supporting  independent
        person, will include the cost  of  housing,  not  included  in  the
        single person's income support rate; so it would not seem  possible
        to take that as the basis, as done in family reunion appeals.

     f) It is not clear from KS (India) or any other case cited to me  what
        the right  basis  of  assessment  would  be,  and,  even  with  the
        declining number of working  holiday-maker  appeals  still  passing
        through the system, it may be of some general interest for this  to
        be established. There is no issue on third  party  support  in  the
        present case, so it may have to  be  decided  on  another  occasion
        whether what the Court of Appeal said  about  that  in  KS  (India)
        survives Ahmed Mahad [2009] UKSC 16.

Submissions

14.   Mr Mahmood submitted that on this basis of the funds available to  the
    appellant he would have at  his  disposal  about  �12,368  (savings  of
    �2,800 together with earnings at the minimum wage of �9,568  (�4.60  an
    hour x 40 hours x 52).  The cost of living  for  two  years  on  income
    support levels  would  be  �47.95  per  week  x  104=�4,986.85  and  if
    accommodation costs were �5 a day they would total  about  �3,605  (�35
    per week x 103 weeks as he would stay for at  least  a  week  with  his
    sponsor = �3,685).  His total costs would therefore be �8,591.85  which
    would leave him with a surplus of �3,908.15.

15.   He submitted that there was no legal basis for using  the  figures  in
    the Lonely Planet Guide and this had led the judge wrongly to  conclude
    that the appellant would need �18,200 for his holiday, a weekly cost of
    �175.  So far as any issue of third  party  support  was  concerned  he
    argued that the judgment of the Court of Appeal in KS  (India)  and  JA
    (Bangladesh) [2009] EWCA Civ  762  should  no  longer  be  regarded  as
    correct in the light of the judgments of the  Supreme  Court  in  Ahmed
    Mahad [2009] UKSC 16.  He argued that  there  was  no  reason  why  the
    income support levels should not be regarded as  a  sensible  benchmark
    rather than the figures in the Lonely Planet Guide.

16.   Ms Isherwood submitted  that  the  judge  had  not  erred  in  law  by
    referring to the Lonely Planet Guide.  A working holidaymaker could not
    be regarded as meeting the requirements of the Rules simply by  showing
    that he could scrape by at a very minimal level.  He would be in a very
    different position from a person on income support and  would  have  to
    meet the additional expenses of taking a holiday.  There was no  reason
    not to take the Lonely Planet Guide figures into account as a guide but
    a flexible approach should be taken.

The Issues

17.   Although the  respondent  was  not  satisfied  about  the  appellant's
    intentions or whether he intended to leave the UK at  the  end  of  his
    working holiday, the immigration judge found that these requirements of
    the rules were met and her decision to dismiss the appeal was solely on
    the ground that the appellant would not be able to meet the maintenance
    and accommodation requirements of the rules.   The  Rules  require  the
    appellant to show that he:

        "(v)     is able and intends to maintain  and  accommodate  himself
             without recourse to public funds ... (para 95(v) of HC 395)."


18.   The onus is on the appellant to show on  a  balance  of  probabilities
    that he can meet this requirement.  The grounds have raised  the  issue
    of how maintenance and accommodation  should  be  assessed  in  working
    holidaymaker cases.  We heard submissions on whether the income support
    level or the figures given in the Lonely Planet Guide could  or  should
    be regarded as the appropriate benchmark.

19.   The proper starting point is to emphasise that  the  onus  is  on  the
    appellant to show that he can meet the requirements of the  rules.   It
    is for him to explain his plans and how he  proposes  to  maintain  and
    accommodate himself.  This is a question of fact to be assessed in  the
    light of the evidence as a whole.  Whether his proposals are  practical
    can be assessed against any  reliable  evidence  of  the  likely  costs
    subject to ensuring that a true comparison can be made.   However,  any
    such evidence is a guide only  and  cannot  be  treated  in  itself  as
    determinative or as displacing or putting a gloss on the wording of the
    rule itself.  It will always be a question of fact to  be  assessed  in
    the light of the evidence produced whether the appellant has shown on a
    balance of probabilities that he is able and intends  to  maintain  and
    accommodate himself without recourse to public funds.

20.   If an appellant has family or friends in this country and  intends  to
    stay with them for a substantial part of his working holiday,  he  will
    not  incur  the  same  accommodation  costs  as  someone  who,  out  of
    necessity,  has  to  meet  the  expense  of  finding  and  paying   for
    accommodation for the whole of his stay.  In the latter case and in the
    absence of any evidence to the contrary, the guideline figures set  out
    in the  Lonely  Planet  Guide  can  properly  be  regarded  as  a  good
    indication of the likely costs.

21.   In this case the Lonely Planet Guide figures were not referred  to  by
    the respondent in his decision and have not been produced  in  evidence
    but no issue has been taken with the figures referred to by  the  judge
    in para 23 of her determination.  In 2006 the  guide  gave  figures  of
    between �40-�60 per day for the cheapest accommodation, food, transport
    and cheap sightseeing/nightlife in London in contrast to  �30  per  day
    outside London if a traveller had his own transport and cooked his  own
    meals to �60 for bed and breakfast accommodation, one other daily meals
    and entrance fees and the judge relied on the  provincial  rate  for  a
    shoestring traveller of �25 a day.

22.   It was argued on behalf of  the  appellant  that  the  income  support
    level for a single person was �47.95 a week and that  if  he  lived  in
    cheap hostel accommodation, he would be able to  support  and  maintain
    himself.  We agree with Ms Isherwood's argument that the income support
    rate is not a satisfactory benchmark for assessing the maintenance  and
    accommodation requirements for a working holidaymaker.  Income  support
    rates what can be regarded as the minimum necessary requirement  for  a
    resident not a holidaymaker and they do not include any  allowance  for
    accommodation, travelling or other incidental expenses associated  with
    a  holiday.  They  provide  a  reasonable   benchmark   for   assessing
    maintenance and accommodation needs for those seeking to settle in  the
    UK but they are of limited value in relation to  working  holidaymakers
    who may have to meet the  cost  of  buying  their  own  meals,  finding
    accommodation and paying for  travel  costs  and  other  general  costs
    associated with a holiday.  There  is  no  single  proper  test  to  be
    applied when assessing maintenance and accommodation in working holiday
    maker appeals but in general terms the Lonely Planet Guide rather  than
    the income support rate is likely to provide a better  way  of  testing
    the viability of an appellant's evidence but inevitably each case  will
    depend upon its own facts. We now turn to the specific  facts  relating
    to this appellant.

23.   The way the appellant has put his case has shifted with  the  changing
    understanding of what the rules mean particularly on the issue of third
    party support although it is now accepted  that  this  issue  does  not
    arise in this appeal.  When the appellant initially made his  claim  he
    said that he would be  maintained  and  accommodated  by  his  sponsor.
    Following the judgment of the Court of Appeal that third party  support
    was not available for working holidaymakers, the appellant revised  the
    way he put his case to explain how he said  he  could  still  meet  the
    requirements of the rules.  There is no reason why an appellant  should
    not seek to take this course in the light of a changed understanding of
    the meaning of the rules: it will be a question  of  fact  whether  any
    adverse inferences on credibility should be drawn from a change in  the
    evidence as to  how  an  appellant  says  that  he  is  able  meet  the
    requirements of the rules.

24.   The appellant sought to argue that with the money  he  had  and  would
    earn, he would still be able to  support  and  accommodate  himself  as
    cheap hostel and dormitory accommodation was available in  places  like
    London and Edinburgh with rates ranging from �3.30 to �10.00 per night.
     It was on this basis that it was argued that with accommodation  costs
    of �5 per day added to  the  cost  of  maintaining  himself  at  income
    support levels, his costs would fall well within his available funds of
    about �12,500.  However, we are not satisfied that if the appellant had
    to find accommodation for his entire holiday save for one or two  weeks
    with his relatives that he would have sufficient  funding  or  that  it
    would really be his intention to spend such long  periods  of  time  in
    such very cheap and low quality accommodation.

25.   The judge accepted that a genuine working holiday was  intended,  that
    the work the appellant proposed to take would  be  incidental  to  that
    holiday and that he intended to return to India once  his  holiday  was
    over.  She also accepted that in fact the appellant would  be  able  to
    stay with his family, his sister and the sponsor.  In para  25  of  her
    determination she referred to the option of applying for a family visit
    visa saying that this would give the appellant the ability  of  staying
    for six months with his family and going sightseeing.  We can  properly
    infer from this comment that the judge accepted that the reality of the
    position was that the appellant would be able to stay with  his  family
    if necessary for extended periods during his working holiday.

26.   We are satisfied that the appellant's real plans were as  outlined  in
    his original application.  He would be based with  his  family  in  the
    West Midlands, would obtain work and when finance permitted would  take
    the opportunity of visiting other parts of the UK when he would be able
    to stay for relatively  short  periods  of  time  in  cheap  hostel  or
    dormitory accommodation.  The appellant has access to funds of  �2,800;
    he can stay with a close relative in  this  country  and  there  is  no
    reason to believe that this accommodation will not be available as  and
    when needed and he has shown that he is likely to be able  obtain  work
    yielding up to �9,568. We are satisfied that he has shown on a  balance
    of probabilities an ability and intention to maintain  and  accommodate
    himself without recourse to public funds.

Decision

27.   The immigration judge erred  in  point  of  law.   We  set  aside  her
    decision and substitute a decision  allowing  the  appeal  against  the
    refusal of entry clearance as a working holidaymaker.
