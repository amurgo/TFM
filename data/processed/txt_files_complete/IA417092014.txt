                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an application to the Upper Tribunal  by  the  Appellant,  with
    permission, against the decision of First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Higgins
    which was promulgated on 1st June 2015.  The Appellant had applied  for
    leave to remain which was refused by the Respondent on 3rd October 2014
    who at the same time made the decision to remove him to India.  It  was
    his appeal against that decision which came before Judge Higgins.

 2. The Appellant came to the UK as a student on 10th July 2010 and he  was
    subsequently granted leave to remain as a post-study work migrant  with
    leave expiring on 7th August 2014.  He made an application for  further
    leave to remain outside the Rules and he did so because his father  had
    died in September 2011. He was his mother's only financial support  and
    he wanted to stay for an additional period to  strength  his  financial
    position before returning to India.

 3. He was clearly not entitled to succeed  under  paragraph  276ADE,  that
    part of the Immigration Rules that deals with private life due  to  the
    length of time he had been in the UK and also his continuing links with
    India.  His wish to support his mother from work within the UK  is  not
    something which would engage  Article  8  outside  the  Rules.   It  is
    difficult to see how human rights could be engaged at all although  the
    judge did in fact consider Article 8, and s.117B  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

 4. It is true that the judge may have misstated  what  the  Appellant  was
    applying for when he recited what is now trite law and indeed contained
    in Section 117B that little regard should  be  given  to  private  life
    established when a  person's  immigration  status  is  precarious.  The
    Appellant's immigration status was in fact precarious  because  he  had
    only ever had periods of temporary leave. The Appellant argues that  he
    was not seeking to remain indefinitely, however, whether he  wished  to
    stay for a short period or indefinitely is  wholly  irrelevant  to  the
    issue of whether or not he ought to succeed on Article 8 grounds.

Notice of Decision

 5. There is no right to work in the UK to support a family in India,  that
    is not a protected human right, and I therefore find that the judge did
    not err in law and the determination shall stand.  The  appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal is dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.
