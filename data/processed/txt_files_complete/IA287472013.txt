For the Appellant:           Mr Gentili, Islington Law Centre
For the Respondent:    Ms Holmes, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Cote D'Ivoire  date  of  birth  9th  May
    1969.  She appeals against the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge Higgins) to dismiss her appeal against the Respondent's decision
    to refuse to issue her with a residence card  as  confirmation  of  her
    right of permanent residence in the UK as the spouse of an EEA national
    exercising treaty rights.


 2. The Appellant asserts that she has a right of permanent residence  with
    reference to Regulation 15(1)(b) of the Immigration (European  Economic
    Area) Regulations 2006:

         15.  (1)  The following persons shall acquire the right to reside
         in the United Kingdom permanently-


         (a) an EEA national who has resided in the United Kingdom in
         accordance with these Regulations for a continuous period of five
         years;


         (b) a family member of an EEA national who is not himself an EEA
         national but who has resided in the United Kingdom with the EEA
         national in accordance with these Regulations for a continuous
         period of five years;
         ...


 3. The Respondent refused to issue a residence card to confirm the same on
    the grounds that the Appellant had not  demonstrated  that  her  French
    husband, a Mr Claude Yapo, had been residing continuously in the UK for
    five years in accordance with the  Regulations,  ie  exercising  treaty
    rights. The Appellant had submitted two wage slips and P60 as  evidence
    of her husband's employment during the relevant period. The  Respondent
    did not consider this evidence adequate.


 4. On  appeal  the  First-tier  Tribunal  heard  oral  evidence  from  the
    Appellant and had regard to further documentary evidence that  she  had
    provided. It appears to have been accepted that  Mr  Yapo  had  been  a
    'worker' for the purpose of the Regulations from 2004  to  sometime  in
    2009/2010 when he took a 'career break'  and  was  claiming  jobseekers
    allowance; he started work again in 2011. On these facts  the  Tribunal
    found that he could not  show  a  continuous  period  of  residence  in
    accordance with the Regulations and  the  appeal  was  dismissed.   The
    determination records that the evidence submitted  included  P60s  that
    appeared to show that Mr Yapo had been working continuously in  the  UK
    between sometime in 2003 and April 2014.

 5. The grounds of appeal to this Tribunal are that the First-tier Tribunal
    erred in:

    a) Failing to consider whether Mr Yapo had already acquired a right  of
       permanent residence before his 'career  break'  in  which  case  the
       Appellant's residence with him in the UK was always  "in  accordance
       with the Regulations"; or in the alternative


    b) Failing to consider whether Mr Yapo  continued  to  be  a  qualified
       person. The Appellant had produced all of his P60s over a  ten  year
       period all of which showed earnings of over �20,000  pa  except  the
       years ending 4/10 and 4/11 in  which  he  only  earned  �11,452  and
       �17,852. It is submitted  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  erred  in
       finding that he was not working during these years (the  sums  shown
       would appear to contradict the evidence of the Appellant that he had
       taken a career break) or alternatively erred in failing to  consider
       whether he was a jobseeker during any breaks in employment.
 6. Before me Ms Holmes conceded that both grounds are made out.  The  P60s
    had not been challenged by the Respondent and these showed that Mr Yapo
    was exercising treaty rights as a worker between 2003/04 and 2008/9. At
    the end of that  five-year  period  he  acquired  permanent  rights  of
    residence, and was therefore thereafter living in the UK "in accordance
    with the Regulations" (see  for  instance  Dias[1]).    The  First-tier
    Tribunal appears to have concentrated on the Appellant's evidence  that
    her husband had decided to take a 'career  break'  sometime  after  the
    birth of their child. Her evidence was that he would say he  was  going
    to the library and would be out  all  day  (see  paragraph  11  of  the
    determination). The determination does not reconcile that evidence with
    the P60s, which indicate that if Mr Yapo  in  fact  continued  to  work
    throughout the years in question.


 7. I am satisfied that the determination does contain an error of law. The
    skeleton argument place before the First-tier Tribunal  by  Mr  Gentili
    raises the argument that Mr Yapo had already acquired a permanent right
    of residence before any 'career break' and the appeal  should,  on  the
    evidence available, have been allowed on that ground. Further the  P60s
    show that the gentleman did in fact continue to exercise treaty  rights
    throughout the period considered relevant by the  First-tier  Tribunal,
    the five years immediately preceding the application.


      Decisions

 8. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains errors of law and
    is set aside.

 9. I re-make the decision in the appeal by allowing the appeal.
