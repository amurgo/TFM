Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr G Hodgetts instructed by Blavo & Co Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr K Hibbs, Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REMITTAL

   1. This appeal is subject to an anonymity order made  by  the  First-tier
      Tribunal pursuant to rule  45(4)(i)  of  the  Asylum  and  Immigration
      Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005 (SI 2005/230).  Neither party  invited
      me to rescind the order and I continue it pursuant to rule 14  of  the
      Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (SI 2008/2698).

   2. The appellant is a citizen of France who was born on 13 November 1984.
       On 2 December 2010 he pleaded guilty to  possessing  a  shotgun  with
      intent to cause fear of violence contrary  to  section  16(a)  of  the
      Firearms Act 1968.  On 30 January 2012, the appellant was sentenced to
      a term of imprisonment of 4� years. On 7 September 2012, the Secretary
      of State made a decision to deport the appellant.   The  Secretary  of
      State was satisfied that the appellant presented a  "genuine,  present
      and  sufficiently  serious  threat  to  the  public"  and   that   his
      deportation was proportionate and therefore justified under regulation
      21(6) of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulation 2006  (SI
      2006/1003) (the "2006 EEA Regulations").  In addition,  the  Secretary
      of State was satisfied that  the  appellant's  deportation  would  not
      breach  Article  8  of  the  ECHR  based,  in  particular,  upon   any
      interference with his family life with his former  partner  and  their
      son or his current partner and his step-daughter.

   3. The First-tier Tribunal (Judge Hart TD and Mrs S E  Singer)  dismissed
      the appellant's appeal under the 2006 EEA Regulations and Article 8 of
      the ECHR.  The appellant was initially refused permission to appeal to
      the Upper Tribunal by the First-tier Tribunal.  However, on 22 January
      2013, the Upper Tribunal (UT Judge  Chalkley)  granted  the  appellant
      permission to appeal.  Thus, the appeal came before me.

Permission and Extending Time

   4. Before turning to the substantive grounds of appeal, an initial  issue
      arose at the  hearing.   Mr  Hibbs,  who  represented  the  respondent
      pointed out that the appellant's application for permission to  appeal
      made to the Upper Tribunal was  out  of  time.    By  virtue  of  rule
      21(3)(aa) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules  2008,  the
      application to the Upper Tribunal must be made "7 working days"  after
      the date on which that notice was sent.  The refusal of permission  by
      the First-tier Tribunal was sent on  29  November  2012.   It  is  not
      disputed that the last date, therefore, for  lodging  the  application
      for  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  was  10  December  2012.    The
      application was actually received on 28 December 2012.  It was  agreed
      that the application was, therefore, 10 working days late.   Mr  Hibbs
      pointed out that in granting permission to appeal  UT  Judge  Chalkley
      had not extended time.  He submitted that time should not be  extended
      and, therefore, permission to appeal had not been granted.

   5. Mr Hodgetts, who represented the appellant relied upon paragraph 3  of
      the grounds drafted by Counsel which pointed out, in essence, that the
      appellant had had extensive difficulties in  engaging  solicitors  and
      was in detention throughout.  In addition, my attention was drawn to a
      supporting statement attached to the grounds  from  "CF"  who  is  the
      appellant's current partner.  In that statement she  points  out  that
      the  appellant's  previous  solicitors  "let  us  down"  and  did  not
      represent the appellant at the hearing.  The appellant received notice
      of the decision on 11 November 2012 and contacted her to inform her of
      the decision and to ask her to find representation as he was currently
      detained in prison.  She explains  that  she  started  to  seek  legal
      representation and was aware that there was only 5 days to  apply  for
      permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.  She had no money to  fund
      the case and started to seek legal aid solicitors.  Unfortunately, she
      was unsuccessful in doing that  and  was  unable  to  find  any  legal
      representation. (I interpose  this  clearly  relates  to  the  initial
      application for permission to appeal to the First-tier Tribunal  which
      was also out of time.)  CF continues  that  she  then  approached  the
      appellant's current solicitors on 15 November 2012  and  was  informed
      that they could represent the appellant on a private  basis.  She  did
      not have funds at the time and she managed to  save  some  money  over
      time before the appellant's current solicitors began to act for him.

   6. Without an extension of time, the permission  to  appeal  cannot  have
      effect.  I note that the application to the  First-tier  Tribunal  was
      not prepared by the appellant's legal representatives but,  presumably
      by him personally.  By virtue of rule  21(7)  of  the  Upper  Tribunal
      Procedure Rules an out of time application may only be admitted if  it
      is "in  the  interests  of  justice"  to  do  so.   In  applying  that
      provision, I also have regard to the overriding objective set  out  in
      rule 2 of the Upper Tribunal Procedure Rules namely to deal  with  the
      case "fairly and justly".  Mr Hibbs did not suggest that the Secretary
      of State was prejudiced by the late application in itself. I also note
      that the Secretary of State did not rely upon  this  in  her  rule  24
      notice dated 25 February 2013 in which she states  her  opposition  to
      the appellant's appeal. I bear in mind that the appellant is  detained
      and  I  accept  what  is  said  in  CF's  statement  that  there  were
      difficulties in obtaining appropriate legal representation and I  also
      note that the application is only 10 working days out of time.  I also
      bear in mind the nature of the appeal which involves  the  deportation
      of an EU  citizen.   Taking  all  these  circumstances  into  account,
      including the need to deal fairly and justly with this  appeal,  I  am
      satisfied that it is in the interest of justice to extend time  albeit
      retrospectively.

The Grounds of Appeal

   7. The grounds of appeal are drafted under three headings.  First, it  is
      said that the panel misdirected itself  as  to  the  correct  approach
      under Article 8 of the ECHR.  Secondly, it is said that the panel,  in
      determining  that  the  appellant's  deportation  was   proportionate,
      speculated on  matters  concerning  his  offending  going  beyond  the
      Sentencing Judge's remarks.  Thirdly, it is said that the panel failed
      properly  to  take  into  account  the  effect  upon  the  appellant's
      relationships with his former partner and son and his current  partner
      and step-daughter.

   8. Although Mr Hodgetts relied on these grounds, he placed emphasis  upon
      particular aspects of the grounds which he amplified in his supporting
      skeleton argument.  In addition, he sought to raise a ground by way of
      amendment to the original ground.  That ground relates to the  panel's
      assessment  of  proportionality  under  reg  21  of   the   2006   EEA
      Regulations.  In reliance upon the Court of Justice's decision in Land
      Baden-W�rttemberg  v  Tsakouridis  (C-145/09)  [2011]  2  CMLR  11  he
      submitted that the panel had failed to consider the  effect  that  the
      deportation decision would have on the appellant's rehabilitation and,
      in particular, had failed to carry out a comparative exercise  on  the
      appellant's prospects for rehabilitation  in  the  UK  as  opposed  to
      France.  Mr Hodgetts relied upon the Court of Appeal's decision  in  R
      (Essa) v Upper Tribunal (Immigration and  Asylum Chamber) [2012]  EWCA
      Civ 1718.  Mr Hodgetts submitted that the proportionality exercise was
      different under EU law than under Article 8 and the panel had erred by
      treating them as the same.

Discussion and Analysis

      The EU point

   9. I deal first with the additional ground which Mr  Hodgetts  wished  to
      rely upon.

  10. Mr Hibbs did not formally object  to  the  amendment  even  though  he
      pointed out that it was somewhat late.   Mr  Hodgetts  submitted  that
      the amended grounds had been drafted  by  him  when  he  had  recently
      received the papers.  He submitted  that  the  impact  of  the  CJEC's
      decision in Tsakouridis had only become apparent following  the  Court
      of Appeal's decision in Essa which was decided on  21  December  2012.
      That was only two days before Counsel  settled  the  original  grounds
      seeking permission  to  appeal.   That  certainly,  in  my  judgement,
      explains the omission of this ground  from  the  original  grounds  as
      drafted.  It does not, however, wholly explain why the  amendment  was
      not put forward until a document dated 30 April  2013  drafted  by  Mr
      Hodgetts was sent to the Tribunal and received on 2 May 2013.

  11. I again bear in mind the overriding objective in  the  Upper  Tribunal
      Procedure Rules of dealing with the appeal "fairly and justly".  As it
      transpired, Mr Hibbs was able to make a number of submissions  on  the
      substance of the ground at the hearing in  response  to  Mr  Hodgetts'
      application to amend the grounds.  I did not form the view that he was
      in any way prejudiced by the matter arising so  late.   No  doubt  the
      implications of Tsakouridis only became apparent after the decision in
      Essa.  The case does involve the deportation of an EU national and the
      point which Mr Hodgetts seeks now to rely on by way of amended grounds
      is clearly seen both by the CJEC and the Court of Appeal in Essa as an
      integral part of EU  law  when  a  decision  maker  is  assessing  the
      proportionality of the expulsion of an EU citizen.

  12. At the hearing, I heard submissions both on the issue of amending  the
      grounds  and  the  substance  of  the  grounds  without  reaching  any
      concluded view  on  whether  to  permit  the  amendment.   Having  now
      considered the matter carefully, I exercise my discretion to allow the
      appellant to amend his grounds so as to include what might  be  called
      as the "rehabilitation" ground after Tsakouridis.

  13. It is convenient to deal with that ground first as it is, in my  view,
      the strongest of the grounds relied upon by Mr Hodgetts.   The  ground
      takes shape,  as  I  have  indicated,  from  the  CJEC's  decision  in
      Tsakouridis.  Expulsion decisions  are  governed  by,  in  particular,
      Articles 27 and 28 of the Citizens Directive  (Directive  2004/38/EC).
      Those provisions are transposed into  the  2006  EEA  Regulations,  in
      particular in regs 19 and 21.  For convenience, I will  refer  to  the
      latter provisions hereafter.  They  have  been  accurately  transposed
      into our law.  So far as relevant regulation 19(3)provides as follows:

           "...an EEA national who has entered the United Kingdom...may  be
           removed if -

                 (a) ....;

                 (b) the Secretary of State has decided  that  the  person's
                 removal is justified on grounds of  public  policy,  public
                 security or public health  in  accordance  with  regulation
                 21."

  14. Regulation 21 sets out the approach to be followed when a decision  is
      taken against an EEA national on "grounds  of  public  policy,  public
      security or public  health"  (see  reg  21(1)).   As  is  well  known,
      regulation 21 sets out a hierarchy of levels of protection in relation
      to decisions to remove EEA citizens on the grounds of public policy or
      public security (see LG (Italy) v SSHD [2008] EWCA Civ  190  at  [14]-
      [15]).  There is a general criteria for removal  "on  the  grounds  of
      public policy, public security or public  health";  a  more  stringent
      criterion requiring  "serious  grounds  of  public  policy  or  public
      security" where an individual has permanent rights of  residence;  and
      finally the "most stringent criterion" that  removal  cannot  be  made
      except on "imperative grounds of public security" when,  for  example,
      the individual has resided for a continuous  period  of  at  least  10
      years prior to the relevant decision.

  15. It is not disputed that the appellant in this appeal  is  entitled  to
      the lowest level of protection namely  removal  may  be  justified  on
      "grounds of public policy, public security or public health".

  16. Regulation 21(5) sets out certain general criteria which must  be  met
      (in fact for each level of protection) as follows:

           "21(5)      Where a relevant decision is  taken  on  grounds  of
                 public policy or public security it shall, in  addition  to
                 complying with the preceding paragraphs of this regulation,
                 be taken in accordance with the following principles -

                    a) the  decision  must  comply  with  the  principle  of
                       proportionality;

                    b)  the  decision  must  be  based  exclusively  on  the
                       personal conduct of the person concerned;

                    c) the personal conduct of  the  person  concerned  must
                       represent a genuine, present and sufficiently serious
                       threat affecting one of the fundamental interests  of
                       society;

                    d) matters isolated from the particulars of the case  or
                       which relate to consideration of  general  prevention
                       do not justify the decision;

                    e) a person's previous criminal convictions  do  not  in
                       themselves justify the decision."

  17. Regulation 21(6) goes on to require that certain  considerations  must
      be taken into account as follows:

           "21(6)      Before taking a relevant decision on the grounds  of
                 public policy or public security in relation  to  a  person
                 who is resident in the United Kingdom  the  decision  maker
                 must take account of considerations such as the age,  state
                 of health, family and economic situation of the person, the
                 person's length of residence in  the  United  Kingdom,  the
                 person's social and cultural integration  into  the  United
                 Kingdom and the extent  of  the  person's  links  with  his
                 country of origin."

  18. In Tsakouridis the CJEC at [50] formulated the balance  that  must  be
      struck in assessing proportionality as follows:

           "50.  In the application of Directive 2004/38, a balance must be
                 struck more particularly between the exceptional nature  of
                 the threat to public security as a result of  the  personal
                 conduct of the person concerned, assessed if  necessary  at
                 the time when the expulsion decision is to  be  made  (see,
                 inter alia, Orfanopoulos v Land Baden-W�tternberg (C-482/01
                 & C-493/01) [2004] E.C.R. I-5257; [2005] 1 C.M.L.R.  18  at
                 [77]-[79]), by reference  in  particular  to  the  possible
                 penalties  and  the  sentences  imposed,  the   degree   of
                 involvement in the criminal activity, and, if  appropriate,
                 the risk of reoffending (see, to that effect,  inter  alia,
                 R. v  Bouchereau  (30/77)  [1977]  E.C.R.  1999;  [1977]  2
                 C.M.L.R. 800 at [29]), on the one hand, and, on  the  other
                 hand, the risk of compromising the social rehabilitation of
                 the Union citizen in the  State  in  which  he  has  become
                 genuinely integrated, which, as the A.G. observes in  point
                 95 of his Opinion, is not only in his interest but also  in
                 that of the European Union in general."

  19. In stating that the risk of reoffending must be assessed  against  the
      "risk of compromising the social rehabilitation" of the EU citizen the
      CJEC approved the observation of the Advocate General at point  95  of
      his opinion that the issue of "social rehabilitation" was  not  merely
      an individual interest but also a interest of the  union  in  general.
      The Advocate General's view in full was as follows:

           "AG95 In  my  view,  when  that  authority  takes  an  expulsion
           decision against a Union citizen following  the  enforcement  of
           the criminal sanction imposed, it must state precisely  in  what
           way  that   decision   does   not   prejudice   the   offender's
           rehabilitation.    Such   a   step,   which   relates   to   the
           individualisation of the sanction of which it is  an  extension,
           seems to me to be the only way of upholding the interests of the
           individual concerned as much as the interest  of  the  Union  in
           general. Even  if  he  is  expelled  from  a  Member  State  and
           prohibited from returning, when released the  offender  will  be
           able, as a Union citizen, to exercise his freedom of movement in
           the other  Member  States.   It  is  therefore  in  the  general
           interests that the conditions of his release should be  such  as
           to dissuade him from committing crimes and,  in  any  event  not
           risk pushing him back into offending."

  20. Mr Hodgetts relied upon these passages  and  the  CJEC's  decision  in
      Tsakouridis.  He submitted that the panel had, albeit through no fault
      of their own, not addressed the issue which the CJEC  required  to  be
      addressed  in  assessing  the  proportionality  of   the   appellant's
      deportation.  He referred me to the decision of the Court of Appeal in
      Essa where  the  Court  approved  the  statement  of  Lang  J  in  the
      Administrative Court ([2012] EWHC 1533 (QB)) at [46]) where she said:

           "In my judgment, the judgment....in Tsakouridis established that
           the  decision-maker,  in  applying  regulation  21  of  the  EEA
           Regulations, must consider whether  a  decision  to  deport  may
           prejudice the prospects of rehabilitation from offending in  the
           host country, and weigh that risk in the balance when  assessing
           proportionality under regulation 21(5)(a).  In most cases,  this
           will necessarily entail  a  comparison  with  the  prospects  of
           rehabilitation in the receiving country....".

  21. Mr Hodgetts pointed out that at [12] Maurice Kay  LJ  stated  that  he
      entirely agreed with that passage and went on to say that:

           "The European dimension, as I have called it, is now part of the
           proportionality exercise when the Secretary of  State  seeks  to
           deport an EU citizen."

  22. Mr Hodgetts submitted that the panel had simply not  dealt  with  this
      issue.  He accepted that there was reference to the  appellant  having
      left France because of his association with  others  using  drugs  and
      offending (see para 178 of the determination) but  he  submitted  that
      the panel had failed to consider the evidence from CF (the appellant's
      current partner) in her statement dated 29 March 2012 (at pages  33-36
      of the respondent's bundle)  that  the  appellant  was  determined  to
      settle into family life  with  her  and  his  son  and  step-daughter.
      Further, Mr Hodgetts submitted that the appellant  had  no  ties  with
      France; both his parents had gone back to Cameroon.  Further the panel
      had not taken into account the evidence of  "SW" (his former  partner)
      in her statement dated 26 April 2012 (at pages 37-40) where  she  also
      spoke of the appellant's desire to, in effect, regain  his  life  with
      his family in the UK on release.  Mr Hodgetts submitted that the panel
      had simply not taken all this evidence into account and engaged in the
      comparative exercise of the impact upon the appellant's rehabilitation
      in the UK and France. Mr Hodgetts also pointed out that the  appellant
      had MAPPA to support in the UK and there was  no  evidence  that  that
      multi-agency support would be available to him in France.

  23. Mr Hibbs made two principal submissions.  First, he submitted that the
      rehabilitation point in Tsakouridis only applied in  cases  of  higher
      level protection under regulation 21.   Tsakouridis was a  case  where
      the individual could only be removed on "imperative grounds of  public
      security". Secondly, Mr  Hibbs  submitted  that  even  if  Tsakouridis
      applied to this appeal, the panel could not have  come  to  any  other
      conclusion as there was no evidence  to  support  the  view  that  his
      rehabilitation  would  be  worsened  by  returning  to   France.    In
      particular, Mr Hibbs submitted that the evidence in the case was  that
      the appellant had not taken advantage of  rehabilitation  measures  in
      the UK.  He had not engaged with the process in the  UK  and  did  not
      appear to be amending his ways.  His criminality  was  escalating,  he
      had failed drug tests in prison and in a letter to his partner he  had
      said that he was "done with the UK life". The evidence was,  Mr  Hibbs
      submitted, not favourable to the appellant.

  24. As regards Mr Hibbs' first  submission,  I  do  not  accept  that  the
      rehabilitation point in Tsakouridis is restricted  to  removals  where
      the individual is entitled to one of the higher levels of  protection.



  25. Mr Hibbs referred me to  an  unreported  determination  of  the  Upper
      Tribunal (Blake J, Chamber President and DUTJ Phillips) in ME  v  SSHD
      (IA/15943/2012).  There the Upper Tribunal found an error of law  when
      the First-tier Tribunal had failed to consider whether  the  prospects
      of that appellant's rehabilitation would be promoted or diminished  by
      his deportation in a case where, as in this one,  that  appellant  was
      only entitled to the lowest level of protection.  Coincidentally in ME
      both Mr Hodgetts and Mr Hibbs were also the representatives.  Mr Hibbs
      indicated that he had been wrong  in  that  appeal  not  to  make  the
      submission that he now made that Tsakouridis  could  not  apply.   The
      decision in ME cannot be dismissed on this point so lightly.  It would
      be very surprising if the panel in that  appeal  had  considered  that
      Tsakouridis was only applicable when the higher level(s) of protection
      were engaged, that the point was not taken by the Panel itself despite
      Mr Hibbs' concession in that appeal.

  26. In any event, ME is consistent with  the  view  that  I  independently
      take.  Nothing in Tsakouridis or, indeed in Essa,  suggests  that  the
      rehabilitation point is  not  equally  relevant  where  the  expulsion
      decision is taken on the grounds of public policy and  the  individual
      is only entitled  to  the  lowest  level  of  protection  set  out  in
      regulation 21 of the 2006 EEA Regulations.  The relevance of the  risk
      of the expulsion order compromising the social rehabilitation  of  the
      EU citizen is engaged regardless of the level of protection that  that
      individual has against  expulsion.   It  is  always  relevant  to  the
      general question of the proportionality  of  his  or  her  removal  or
      expulsion. Likewise, its relevance as an interest of the EU in general
      pertains regardless of the level of protection from expulsion to which
      a particular individual is entitled.   For these reasons, I reject  Mr
      Hibbs first submission.

  27. Turning now to Mr Hibbs' second submission, there may be some force in
      what he says.  It is clear that the panel did  not  expressly  address
      the issue of comparative rehabilitation faced by the appellant in  the
      UK and, if removed, in France.  Although the  panel's  decision  post-
      dates the CJEC's decision in Tsakouridis, it pre-dates  the  Court  of
      Appeal's decision in Essa which highlighted an aspect of EU law  which
      had, perhaps, previously  slipped  "under  the  radar".    I  do  not,
      however, accept Mr Hibbs' submission that there was no evidence before
      the panel relevant to the issue  of  comparative  rehabilitation  such
      that the panel could not conceivably  have  reached  any  other  view.
      Without setting it out in here, there may well not have been the level
      of  evidence  that  there  was  in  ME  (see  para  15  of  the   UT's
      determination).  There was nevertheless evidence from the  appellant's
      partners of his desire to foster his social  links  and  therefore  of
      support systems in the UK.  There was no evidence of any  such  social
      support systems in France.  His parents no longer live  there.   There
      was also evidence  of  'bad  company'  in  France  that  had  led  the
      appellant to come to the  UK.    Of  course  I  accept,  as  Mr  Hibbs
      submitted, that there was equally evidence  of  the  appellant's  'bad
      company' that he kept in the UK.  The point is,  however,  that  there
      was evidence relevant both to the prospects of his  rehabilitation  in
      the UK and also in France which the panel simply did not engage  with.
      The evidence might  well  be  described  as  "mixed".   It  does  not,
      however, in my view point wholly in one direction.

  28. Ultimately, in my view the panel has simply not done what the CJEC  in
      Tsakouridis required of it in determining the proportionality  of  the
      appellant's deportation under EU law.  It was that  factor  which,  as
      the  Court  of  Appeal  makes  plain  in  Essa,   differentiates   the
      proportionality assessment under Article 8 from that  required  by  EU
      law.  The panel dealt with the issue of  proportionality  as  if  that
      issue was  the  same  under  both  legal  regimes.   As  a  result  of
      Tsakouridis the issue of proportionality under  EU  law  required  the
      panel to carry out the comparative exercise in assessing the prospects
      of rehabilitation in the host and receiving countries and  in  failing
      to do so the panel erred in law and its decision under  the  2006  EEA
      Regulations cannot stand and is, as a result, set aside.

      Article 8

  29. Mr Hodgetts frankly accepted in his  submissions  that  his  strongest
      case was under the EU Regulations.   If he  could  not  succeed  under
      those, then he  could  not  succeed  under  Article  8.  However,  his
      remaining submissions were, apart from the first ground,  directed  at
      findings made by the panel in respect of Article 8 and which, if  they
      stand, would be relevant  in  assessing  the  proportionality  of  the
      appellant's removal under EU law.

  30. Mr Hodgetts did not strongly press ground  1  which  argues  that  the
      panel misdirected itself, in particular  at  paras  122  and  123,  by
      stating that even after the House of Lords in Huang [2007] UKHL 11 had
      expunged the "exceptionality test" when assessing  proportionality  it
      was nevertheless "only in rare cases" that an applicant succeed  under
      Article  8  when  his  claim  fell  outside  the  Immigration   Rules.
      Reliance is placed, in particular, upon the speech of Lord Bingham  at
      [12] in EB (Kosovo) v SSHD [2008] UKHL 41.  The thrust of  the  ground
      is that the position is rather  to  the  contrary,  namely  where  the
      decision results in the removal of a spouse  and  that  spouse  cannot
      reasonably be expected to follow  the  removed  spouse,  removal  will
      "rarely be proportionate".

  31. As I have said, Mr Hodgetts did not strongly rely  upon  this  ground.
      In my judgement it patently fails in this appeal.  The passage in  the
      panel's determination appears in a  long  section  dealing  with  "the
      Legal Framework" at paras 115-153.  That section sets  out  at  length
      the relevant EU law and domestic law  concerning  the  application  of
      Article 8.  Even if the ground hits the target by identifying an error
      of approach in para 122, which I am far from satisfied that  it  does,
      it fails to take into account that EB (Kosovo) was  a  case  concerned
      with removal rather than deportation.  As the Court of Appeal has made
      clear in JO (Uganda); JT (Ivory Coast) v SSHD [2010] EWCA Civ  10  and
      KB (Trinidad and Tobago) v SSHD [2010] EWCA Civ 11, the  statement  EB
      (Kosovo) requires modification in the context of deportation where the
      public interest in the prevention of crime  or  disorder  is  stronger
      than the public interest in the maintenance of  effective  immigration
      control.  The point is made, for example, by  Richards  LJ  in  KB  at
      [17].  That case law is cited at length by the panel at paras 142-150.
       In my judgement, the panel did not misdirect  itself  on  the  proper
      approach to assessing proportionality under Article  8  of  the  ECHR.
      The panel properly recognised the public interest, as set out  in  the
      domestic case law conveniently summarised in OH (Serbia) v SSHD [2008]
      EWCA Civ 694, at para 136-137 of its determination.  Ground 1 does not
      hit its target and I reject it.

  32. In relation to ground 2, Mr Hodgetts' submission  is  that  the  panel
      reached an irrational or unreasoned conclusion  that  the  appellant's
      partners (in particular his  current  partner,  CF)  could  reasonably
      accompany him to France.  In paragraph 176 the panel said this:

           "176. We accept that neither Miss [W] nor  Miss  [F]  and  their
                 children  can  conveniently  travel  to  France  with   the
                 appellant but, France being a country close to  the  United
                 Kingdom  and  a  member  of  the  EEA,  it  would  not   be
                 unreasonable and certainly not unsafe for the appellant  to
                 return there and be accompanied by Miss  [W].   However  we
                 find the reality is that they would  place  their  children
                 and their own interests before those of the appellant."

  33. Before me it was accepted that the reference to "Miss [W]" (SW) in the
      penultimate sentence  was  in  fact  a  typographical  error  and  was
      intended to be a reference  to  "Miss  [F]"  (CF).   Nevertheless,  Mr
      Hodgetts submitted that this finding failed to have regard to the fact
      that  CF's daughter was a British citizen and it was  unreasonable  to
      expect a child aged 8 (and Mr Hodgetts  pointed  out  that  the  panel
      never referred to the age of CF's daughter) to relocate to France.  He
      submitted that, in any event, it could not be reasonable to expect  SW
      to go to France as her relationship with the appellant had ended.

  34. I accept the substance Mr Hodgetts' submission.  Even  correcting  for
      the typographical error, the panel gave only one  reason  for  finding
      that it would not be unreasonable for CF to accompany  the  appellant,
      namely that France was "a country close to the United  Kingdom  and  a
      member of the EEA".   The panel made no reference to the circumstances
      of CF's daughter who was aged 8.  Indeed, the panel at no point refers
      to the age of CF's daughter.  Further, to the extent  that  the  panel
      was finding that it was reasonable for SW to accompany  the  appellant
      to France that would be a wholly irrational finding given  that  their
      relationship has ended despite the fact that  they  remained  on  good
      terms.  I do not understand the panel to be making such a  finding  in
      para 176 but unfortunately nowhere else does the panel find one way or
      another whether it  would  be  reasonable  for  SW  to  accompany  the
      appellant.

  35. Indeed, it might be thought curious that the panel found  that  either
      of the appellant's partners  (together  with  their  children)  should
      accompany him to France given the panel's view that it was not in  the
      best interests of the appellant's son or  step-daughter  to  associate
      with the appellant because of his drug  use  (see  paras  181-182  and
      187).

  36. As regards the panel's finding in relation  to  the  children's  "best
      interests", there was no social services report.  The panel's  finding
      was, in large measure, predicated upon the perceived risk or detriment
      to the appellant's son and step-daughter of  his  substantial  use  of
      drugs.  The panel does, indeed, ultimately find at para 191  that  the
      appellant's presence in the UK is not only a danger to the public  but
      also to members of his own family.   The  risk  to  the  public  as  a
      result of the appellant's risk of  reoffending  was  identified  in  a
      report as a "medium risk".  Whilst the panel was entitled,  therefore,
      to find and act upon the fact that he was a danger to the  public,  it
      is far from clear on what basis they took  the  view  that  he  was  a
      danger to  his  own  family.   As  Mr  Hodgetts  pointed  out  in  his
      submissions, the panel seems to have run together  two  parts  of  the
      evidence: first, that the appellant had the care  of  his  son  during
      visits on the weekend and, secondly, that he used cocaine and cannabis
      during those weekends.  Therefore, he presented a danger  to  his  son
      and, although it is not clear whether the panel thought this also,  to
      his step-daughter with whom he lived.  In my  judgement,  the  panel's
      reasoning is confused and does not support a finding  that  he  was  a
      risk to members of his family.  To the  extent  that  such  a  finding
      factored into the panel's view as to the best interests of his son and
      step-daughter, that error taints the panel's finding that it is not in
      the best interests of his children (the panel specifically  refers  to
      his son at para 197) for the appellant to remain in  the  UK.   It  is
      somewhat of a mystery as to why that finding in relation  to  his  son
      was not also made in  relation  to  his  step-daughter  with  whom  he
      actually lived.

      Conclusions

  37. Regrettably in this  lengthy  determination  of  some  190  paragraphs
      covering 42 pages, the panel's reasoning and findings do not, for  the
      reasons I have given, stand up  to  scrutiny.   Therefore,  with  some
      regret,  given  the  detail  of  the  panel's  determination,  I  have
      concluded that its decision in relation to Article 8 also cannot stand
      including  any  of  its  factual   findings   in   relation   to   the
      reasonableness of the appellant's family relocating to France  and  in
      respect of the best interests of his son and step-daughter.

Decision and Disposal

  38. Thus, the decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the  making  of
      an error of law.  Its decision cannot stand and is set aside.

  39. Having set aside the  panel's  decision,  given  the  extent  of  fact
      finding required in relation to Article 8 and the 2006 EEA Regulations
      it is, in my view, appropriate to remit the appeal to  the  First-tier
      Tribunal having regard to paragraph  7.2  of  the  Senior  President's
      Practice Statements.

  40. The appeal is remitted for a de novo rehearing before  the  First-tier
      Tribunal (any constitution not to include Judge Hart TD  or  Mrs  S  E
      Singer).
