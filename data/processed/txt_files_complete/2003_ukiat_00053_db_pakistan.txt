Appearances
For the appellant:     Mr A Sheikh, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the respondent:          Mr R Sheikh of RS Advisory Service

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    This is an appeal by the Entry Clearance Officer,  Islamabad,  against
      the determination of an Adjudicator (Dr S  S  Juss)  who  allowed  the
      respondent's appeals against the  decision  made  on  1  October  2001
      refusing them entry clearance for settlement under  paragraph  317  of
      HC395.   In  this  determination  the  Tribunal  will  refer  to   the
      respondents to this appeal as the applicants.

2.    The applicants are both citizens of Pakistan, the first applicant  was
      born in 1922 and his wife, the second applicant,  was  born  in  1927.
      They applied for entry  clearance  to  join  their  grandson,  Shabbir
      Hussain,  as  his  dependent  relatives.   This  was  not  the   first
      application which had been made for settlement.  In November  2000  an
      appeal was heard by an Adjudicator against a decision made on 20 April
      2000 refusing them entry clearance to join  their  son  and  grandson,
      Shaheem Akhtar and Shabbir Hussain as dependent relatives.

3.    That appeal was heard and dismissed by Mrs D E Taylor on  28  November
      2000.  She was not satisfied that the  requirements  of  para  317  of
      HC395 were  met.   In  particular  she  was  not  satisfied  that  the
      applicants only had one son living in the United Kingdom.   There  was
      evidence from  a  field  trip  to  the  village  at  Dhak,  where  the
      applicants lived, that the Entry Clearance Officer saw an Eid card  in
      their home from their son Abdul Aziz in Stoke.  In the evidence before
      Mrs Taylor Shabbir Hussain had said he was unable  to  identify  Abdul
      Aziz and repeated that there was only one son in the  United  Kingdom.
      The Adjudicator did not believe  this  evidence.   She  also  did  not
      believe that  land  owned  by  the  applicants  in  Pakistan  was  not
      producing any income.  She accepted that  money  had  been  sent  from
      relatives in the United Kingdom and that Shabbir Hussain had  sent  to
      the applicants reasonably substantial sums of money but  she  was  not
      satisfied that this amounted to financial dependency on him.  She felt
      that it was more likely that it was  his  father  and  uncle  who  had
      provided money for the house in Pakistan.  She also commented that the
      applicants had two grandsons working in the next village.   They  were
      well housed and had received financial support from the United Kingdom
      family over the years.  That support might continue but whether it did
      or not, the applicants had equally close relatives to the  sponsor  in
      Pakistan to whom they could turn for  financial  support  should  that
      prove necessary.  In these circumstances the appeal was dismissed.

4.    There was an application  for  leave  to  appeal  to  the  Immigration
      Appeal Tribunal which was refused in a determination  notified  on  15
      March 2001.  When refusing leave the Vice President commented that the
      Adjudicator had not been satisfied that the applicants were wholly  or
      mainly dependent on a relative  present  and  settled  in  the  United
      Kingdom and that it was clear that there were other close relatives of
      their own in Pakistan to turn to for financial support.

5.    A further application for entry clearance was made on 27  April  2001.
      The first applicant was interviewed on 1 October 2001.   He  confirmed
      that he wished to go to the United Kingdom to settle with his grandson
      as there was no one to take care of them in  Pakistan.   He  confirmed
      that he had been refused entry clearance on three previous  occasions,
      two visitor applications and one settlement application.  He was asked
      what had changed since the last application and he replied that it was
      the same.  His grandson sent him R.10,000 a month.  He received  money
      from other members of the family.  His son sent R.15-20,000 every  two
      or three months.  He was asked about Abdul Aziz.  He replied  that  he
      did not know where he was.  He was reminded that the  application  had
      been refused on the last occasion as he had two daughters in Pakistan.
       One was married with sons.   He  was  asked  what  had  changed.   He
      replied that his first daughter was living with her  husband  and  the
      second daughter was living with  them.   She  was  not  well  and  her
      children looked after her.  They could not look after  the  applicants
      as well.

6.    The Entry Clearance Officer refused the  application  as  he  was  not
      satisfied that  the  applicants  were  financially  wholly  or  mainly
      dependent on Shabbir  Hussain,  nor  that  they  had  no  other  close
      relatives in their country to  whom  they  could  turn  for  financial
      support.

7.    At the hearing the Adjudicator heard oral evidence from  the  sponsor.
      He also had documentary evidence which is referred to in  paragraph  5
      of his determination.  In paragraph 7 the Adjudicator referred to  the
      previous determination.  He commented as follows:

           "The respondent relies  upon  a  previous  determination  by  an
           Adjudicator, namely, Mrs D E Taylor, dated 25 January  2001.   I
           have looked at this decision.  It states (at para 12)  that  the
           appellants are financially dependent upon money coming from  the
           UK.  There is no suggestion that they have any other income from
           Pakistan.  However the Learned Adjudicator notes that there  are
           other close relatives in Pakistan to  whom  the  appellants  can
           turn for financial support.  I have  naturally  looked  at  this
           determination because it is referred to by the ECO.   However  I
           have taken care not to be affected in any way by it. This  is  a
           de novo application for entry clearance and a de  novo  hearing.
           The ECO's explanatory statement goes on to say  that  since  the
           appeal was dismissed, the sponsor, Mr Hussain has  continued  to
           remit money to the appellants.  At the interview there appear to
           have been no material changes in circumstances  since  the  last
           appeal was dismissed. The principal difficulty with this case as
           I note, is this.  There  appears  to  have  been  a  credibility
           challenge to the first appellant.  Mr Mohamed gave a full family
           tree  to  the  ECO.   However,  he  continued  to  maintain,  as
           previously, that he did not know the whereabouts of  his  second
           son.  The ECO said that given that they  had  seen  evidence  of
           contact on their last visit, this did not appear credible."

8.    The Adjudicator went  on  to  review  the  evidence  before  him.  The
      sponsor explained that the applicant had a daughter Sakina  who  lived
      about 40 miles away.  She was a widow and could  not  look  after  the
      applicants.  Maqsood Bi is the other daughter who lives about half  an
      hour away.  Her husband is a  farmer.   She  has  six  children.   The
      sponsor explained that  their  culture  was  that  daughters  did  not
      support the father if there was a son.  There was also a  daughter  in
      England called Zamir Bi. The sponsor explained that he  had  supported
      his grandparents for 10 to 12 years sending about ï¿½100 per month which
      was converted into about 9,000 Rupees.  Since 1984  he  had  made  six
      visits to Pakistan to see his grandparents.

9.    The sponsor went on to explain how Abdul Aziz fitted into the  family.
       He was not the son  of  the  applicants  but  was  his  grandfather's
      brother's son.  When Abdul Aziz's father died he had been  brought  up
      by the applicants.  The sponsor's father had given his daughter  (i.e.
      the sponsor's sister, Rubini) to him in marriage.  This had not worked
      out and as a result the sponsor's family had broken off  contact  with
      him but Abdul Aziz did maintain some contact with the applicants, even
      though he was not their son.

10.   The Adjudicator accepted that the sponsor's evidence was credible.   A
      steady stream of remittances had been sent over a long period of time.
       He accepted that the applicants were wholly or  mainly  dependent  on
      funds being  remitted  from  the  United  Kingdom.   He  accepted  the
      evidence that the daughters in Pakistan were not in a position to help
      and that there was no other son in Pakistan. There was Abdul Aziz  but
      the Adjudicator commented that he saw no evidence that  he  was  in  a
      position  financially   to   support   the   applicants.    In   these
      circumstances the appeal was allowed.

11.   In the grounds of appeal it is argued that the Adjudicator  was  wrong
      to leave out of account the findings in the first appeal heard by  Mrs
      Taylor.  The Adjudicator should have followed the guidelines  set  out
      in  Devaseelan  [2002]   UKIAT   00702.    The   first   Adjudicator's
      determination should  always  be  the  starting  point  and  if  facts
      personal to the applicants had not been brought to  the  attention  of
      the first Adjudicator they should be treated with circumspection.

12.   Mr A Sheikh adopted these grounds.  He argued  that  it  was  implicit
      from the terms of Rule 44 of the 2000 Procedure  Rules  that  previous
      determinations were relevant.   The  Adjudicator  had  been  wrong  to
      direct himself that this was a fresh hearing and that he should not be
      effected in any way by the previous determination.

13.   Mr R Sheikh submitted that it was not clear  that  Devaseelan  applied
      as a matter of principle to second appeals  on  the  same  or  similar
      facts.   The  approach  in  human  rights  and  asylum   cases   would
      necessarily be different from immigration  appeals.   The  Adjudicator
      has found the sponsor to be credible.  This finding was properly  open
      to him on the  evidence.   These  were  issues  of  fact  for  him  to
      determine.

14.   The issue of second appeals based  on  similar  facts  is  not  a  new
      phenomenon in this jurisdiction but the issue  acquired  a  degree  of
      prominence following  the  determination  in  Pardeepan  (00/TH/02414)
      which considered the Immigration & Asylum Act 1999 (Commencement No. 6
      Transitional and Consequential Provisions (Order 2000)) which provided
      that human rights appeals under Section 65 of the 1999 Act  would  not
      have effect when the decision was taken before 2  October  2000.   The
      consequence of the Transitional  Provisions  was  that  following  the
      determination of asylum claims, further human rights claims were  made
      often based on the same facts.  The determination  in  Devaseelan  set
      out guidelines as to  how  Adjudicators  hearing  the  second  appeals
      should approach the first determination.  However the issue of  second
      appeals is not  limited  to  asylum  and  human  rights  appeals.   In
      immigration  appeals  and  in  particular  marriage   and   settlement
      applications, it is not unusual for a second or even third application
      to  be  made   following   previous   adverse   decisions.    Previous
      determinations were not left out of account but were treated not  only
      as part of the factual background but also  as  determinative  of  the
      issues as at the date of the decision

15.   There is nothing in Devaseelan which limits its principles  to  asylum
      and human rights appeals. There is no reason why  they  should  be  so
      limited.  We are satisfied that the principles set out  in  Devaseelan
      apply to all categories of appeals coming before Adjudicators and  the
      Tribunal.

16.   It follows that the Adjudicator was wrong to  disregard  the  findings
      in the previous determination, and wrong to take care, as he described
      it, not to be affected in any way by the previous  determination.   It
      would be very unsatisfactory and not in the interests of justice if an
      Adjudicator paid  no  regard  to  a  previous  determination  in  such
      circumstances, particularly when the application the  subject  of  the
      appeal before him was made only a matter of weeks after a  refusal  of
      leave to appeal by the Tribunal.  In this case Mrs  Taylor  heard  the
      appeal on 28 November 2000.  Leave to appeal was refused on  15  March
      2001 and a fresh application was made within a matter of weeks  on  27
      April 2001.  Even though the first appeal related to a  decision  made
      on 20 April 2000, it would be  wholly  artificial  to  disregard  that
      determination when assessing the merits of the second decision.

17.   As the Tribunal emphasised in paragraph 37  in  Devaseelan  the  first
      determination stands as an assessment of the claim made as at the date
      of the determination.  It is not binding on  the  second  Adjudicator.
      The second Adjudicator is not hearing an appeal against it.  The first
      determination may be built on and further evidence may come  to  light
      which leads to a different outcome before the second Adjudicator.  The
      situation at the date of  the  later  decision  may  be  shown  to  be
      different from the situation previously obtaining, and  there  may  be
      further evidence which either was not or could have been  put  to  the
      first Adjudicator.

18.   In our view therefore the guidelines set out in  Devaseelan  apply  in
      respect of all second appeals, subject only to applying the guidelines
      sensibly to immigration  appeals:  the  guidelines  refer  to  country
      evidence but as only an example of the evidence  of  other  facts  not
      personal to the applicants which may fall to be considered.

19.   The Tribunal cannot be satisfied that if the Adjudicator  had  applied
      the principles set out in Devaseelan to  this  appeal  that  he  would
      necessarily have reached the same conclusions.  When  interviewed  the
      applicants accepted that the situation was the same as at the previous
      application.  It was accepted  that  they  had  land  which  had  been
      farmed. There was some issue about precisely who was the owner of  the
      land but no issue that the  income  from  the  land  would  have  been
      available to the applicants.  Mrs Taylor simply did  not  believe  the
      evidence that the fields were just left alone  and  people  in  nearby
      villages took  the  crops  for  free.  She  said  that  no  doubt  the
      applicants received some crops from their land and possibly monies  as
      well.  She had been told in evidence  that  the  applicants  had  been
      unable to identify Abdul Aziz and that there was only one son  in  the
      United Kingdom.  She did not believe this.  She did not  believe  that
      the sole source of the money used to maintain the applicants was  from
      Shabbir Hussain, the sponsor.  She commented at paragraph  14  of  her
      determination that there were two other grandsons working in the  next
      village. She was satisfied  that  the  applicants  had  equally  close
      relatives to the sponsor, i.e. grandchildren, in Pakistan to whom they
      could turn for financial support.

20.   At the hearing before Dr Juss there was  an  explanation  about  Abdul
      Aziz.  This is set out in  paragraph  12  of  the  determination.   He
      accepted the evidence that there had been a family rift and that Abdul
      Aziz was in fact the nephew of the applicant and had been  brought  up
      by them.  There appears to be no further explanation of his  continued
      relationship with the applicants or what role, if any,  he  played  in
      the applicants' lives.  Dr Juss found that the relatives  in  Pakistan
      were not in a position to help the applicants whereas Mrs  Taylor  had
      been satisfied that they could be turned to for financial support.

21.   In  summary  the  Tribunal  are  not  satisfied  that  Dr  Juss  would
      necessarily have come to the same conclusions if he had  taken  proper
      account  of  Mrs  Taylor's  determination  in  accordance   with   the
      guidelines in Devaseelan.  In our view the proper course is  for  this
      appeal to be remitted  for  a  fresh  hearing.   We  appreciate  Mr  R
      Sheikh's concerns which he expressed at the hearing arising  from  the
      age of the applicants and the effect of  the  evidence  given  by  the
      sponsor  and  summarised  by  Dr  Juss  in   paragraph   12   of   his
      determination.  However, the fact remains that the Tribunal are not in
      a position to assess whether the provisions of para 317 of HC395  have
      been met.  The only course that does justice to both sides is for this
      appeal to be remitted for re-hearing.

22.   Accordingly, this appeal is allowed to the extent that it is  remitted
      for a fresh hearing by an Adjudicator (not Dr S S Juss).
