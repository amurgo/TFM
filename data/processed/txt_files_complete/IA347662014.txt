                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS









      Introduction


      1.    The Appellant appealed with  permission  granted  by  First-tier
           Tribunal Judge PJM Hollingworth on 16 August  2017  against  the
           determination of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  O'Malley  who  had
           dismissed the appeal of the Appellant seeking settlement outside
           the Immigration Rules on Article 8 ECHR grounds on  the  grounds
           of her relationship akin to marriage  with  a  British  Citizen.
           The decision and reasons was promulgated on 30 January 2017.


      2.    The Appellant is a  national  of  Nigeria.   The  Appellant  had
           claimed to have been in the United Kingdom since March 1995.  An
           Article  8  ECHR  application  was  refused  in  2010.   Further
           representations were however  made  in  2014.   The  Appellant's
           appeal to the First-tier Tribunal was dismissed in  2015  but  a
           material error of law was found and the appeal was  directed  to
           be reheard, with a preserved  finding  that  the  quasi  marital
           relationship was genuine.


      3.    Judge O'Malley applied that finding in his decision and reasons.
            He found that that it was  not  unreasonable  for  the  British
           Citizen  husband/partner  to  relocate  to  Nigeria   with   the
           Appellant to continue their family life there.   There  were  no
           insurmountable  obstacles  and   there   were   no   exceptional
           circumstances.  The  best  interests  of  the  husband/partner's
           children would not be affected as they would  remain  living  in
           the  United  Kingdom  with   their   mother,   the   Appellant's
           husband/partner's ex-wife.  Contact with their father  would  be
           maintained to a similar limited degree as at present. There  was
           no disproportionality in Article 8 ECHR terms when the balancing
           exercise was performed.  The judge dismissed the appeal on  that
           basis. (There was no discussion of Chen [2015] UKUT 00189  (IAC)
           and the impact of temporary separation while entry clearance was
           sought from abroad.)


      3.    Permission to appeal  was  granted  because  it  was  considered
           arguable  that  the  judge  had  erred  by  giving   in   effect
           insufficient weight to  the  value  of  the  existing  level  of
           contact with the  two  minor  children  and  the  diminution  of
           contact which would follow if  the  Appellant's  husband/partner
           went to Nigeria to live with her.  The best  interests  analysis
           was inadequate.


      4.    Standard directions were made  by  the  tribunal.    A  rule  24
           notice opposing the appeal was filed by the Respondent.




      Submissions


      5.    Mr Plowright for the Appellant relied on the grounds of  onwards
           appeal and grant.  In summary he sought to argue that the  judge
           had failed  to  address  the  central  issue  of  insurmountable
           obstacles.  The judge had looked at the  factual  situation  too
           narrowly and without sufficient attention to the  value  of  the
           paternal relationship with  the  two  minor  children,  and  the
           importance of the actual level of contact. Agyarko  [2017]  UKSC
           11 applied to reasonableness.  The judge had not dealt  properly
           with the parental rï¿½le.   The judge's narrow approach was beyond
           or outside the permissible range of reasonable responses to  the
           facts as found.  The  determination  should  be  set  aside  and
           remade.


      6.    Mr Wilding for the Respondent relied on the rule 24  notice  and
           submitted that there was plainly no material error of law.    It
           had been accepted that Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules  had
           not been met and the judge's Article 8 ECHR findings  were  open
           to him. The substance of  Agyarko  had  been  applied.   It  was
           understandable  that  the  decision  was  disappointing  to  the
           Appellant and her partner, but  the  submissions  made  and  the
           grounds earlier filed amounted to  no  more  than  disagreement.
           The judge had taken care to engage with the  best  interests  of
           the individual children concerned, as the determination  showed.
           This was not an appeal where there was an inevitable conclusion,
           one way  or  the  other.   The  balancing  exercise  had  to  be
           performed and the judge's conclusions were open to him.  Welfare
           and safeguarding had been addressed and the judge's approach was
           correct.   The onwards appeal should be dismissed.


      7.    In reply, Mr  Plowright  briefly  emphasised  the  weight  which
           should have been given to the existing level of contact.


      No material error of law finding


      8.    In the tribunal's view the grant of  permission  to  appeal  was
           rather generous, and failed to reflect the fact that the  appeal
           was in reality a misconceived one, where a  one  track  approach
           had been taken.  Unfortunately it is  typical  of  many  appeals
           seen in the First-tier Tribunal and again in the Upper  Tribunal
           involving couples who cannot meet the Immigration Rules (or  who
           have made no attempt, as here, to meet them) seeking to rely  on
           Article 8 ECHR grounds.   They have a high hurdle  to  overcome.
           Had the Appellant returned to Nigeria in 2010 at latest  as  she
           very obviously should have done (it was her own  case  that  she
           was an illegal entrant), she would have been able to  enter  the
           United Kingdom to join her husband/partner under  the  far  less
           stringent provisions of the now repealed paragraph  281  of  the
           Immigration Rules.  Those Immigration  Rules  were  replaced  by
           from 9 July 2012  by  the  much  more  demanding  provisions  of
           Appendix FM, especially Appendix FM-SE.   Even so, there was  no
           evidence  that  those  provisions  could  not  with  appropriate
           efforts be complied with, as the Appellant's husband/partner has
           secure employment and his income meets or  exceeds  the  minimum
           income requirement  laid  down  in  Appendix  FM.   The  current
           unhappy situation was created by the parties.   The  Appellant's
           husband/partner knew that the Appellant had no leave to enter or
           remain.  Compliance with the law is not a matter  of  individual
           choice.  Time and  money  have  been  wasted  seeking  the  near
           impossible,  when  obvious  and  satisfactory   solutions   were
           available.


      9.    The very experienced judge correctly identified that the  issues
           before him were whether family life could be  lived  in  Nigeria
           and whether that would be proportionate in Article 8 ECHR terms,
           in  other  words,  whether  there   would   be   "insurmountable
           obstacles": see the reasons for refusal letter.  The  judge  was
           well aware that the best interests of two  minor  children  also
           had to be considered in the Article 8 ECHR balancing exercise to
           determine proportionality, all approached through  the  lens  of
           the Immigration Rules.  Agyarko was  followed,  especially  [42]
           and [43].


      10.   The tribunal agrees with Mr  Wilding's  submissions  as  to  the
           judge's analysis and findings.  Close attention was given to the
           situation of the two minor children: see [58]  to  [67]  of  the
           determination.  The facts concerning the level of actual contact
           were not in real dispute and the  judge  was  entitled  to  draw
           inferences from his close analysis of  those  facts,  which  was
           commendably  thorough.   The  judge  examined  the  appeal  with
           empathy and considered every aspect  with  care,  including  the
           Appellant's husband/partner's prospects of employment in Nigeria
           and how that might affect the children's best interests.


      11.   The judge's findings  were  all  open  to  him,  and  cannot  be
           impugned as superficial or unreasonable.  As Mr Wilding  pithily
           observed, it was an appeal which could have gone one way or  the
           other, provided sufficient reasons were given.  The  facts  were
           open to a range of reasonable responses  and  the  tribunal  can
           only interfere where the response to the facts was  demonstrably
           unreasonable or irrational.


      12.    There  was  no  suggestion  that  the  experienced  judge   had
           misunderstood any of the evidence.  Section 117B of NIA 2002 was
           required to be applied to the findings of fact.   The  Appellant
           had been in the United Kingdom precariously for  many  years  by
           the date of the hearing and her husband/partner was  well  aware
           of her lack of status.  She was not financially independent.


      13.   The tribunal concludes that Mr Plowright's submissions, like the
           onwards  grounds,  amount  to  no  more  than  disagreement   or
           disappointment with the judge's decision.   The  tribunal  finds
           that there was no error of law in the decision challenged.


      14.   Plainly the  Appellant  and  her  husband/partner  have  several
           reasonable options open to them for the  continuation  of  their
           family life, i.e., to live together  in  Nigeria  or  to  travel
           there together on a visit while entry clearance is sought or  to
           separate on a temporary basis while the Appellant obtains  entry
           clearance on the terms  prescribed  by  the  Immigration  Rules.
           The second option will probably simplify continued contact  with
           the husband/partner's children, but these are decisions for  the
           parties.


      DECISION


      The appeal is dismissed


      The making of the previous decision did not involve the making  of  an
error on a point of law.  The decision stands unchanged.
