Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr R Sharma, of Counsel instructed by Messrs Stella
                    Maris Solicitors LLP
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellants appeal against a determination of Judge  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Mitchell who in a determination  promulgated  on  12  May
    2017 dismissed their appeals for lack of jurisdiction.

2.   The appellants had applied against a decision of  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer, Islamabad to refuse them EEA family permits to enable them  to
    join an uncle in Britain as other family members under  the  provisions
    of Regulation 8 of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.

3.   Judge  Mitchell  dismissed  their  claims  appling  the  terms  of  the
    determination of the Tribunal in Sala (EFMs: Right  of  Appeal)  [2016]
    UKUT 00411/IAC.  He did not consider the merits of the claims.

4.   The decision in Sala has been overturned by  the  Court  of  Appeal  in
    their judgment in Khan v SSHD [2017] EWCA Civ 1744.  In  that  judgment
    the Court of Appeal ruled that those who applied for leave to remain or
    enter under Regulation 8 of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006 were
    entitled to a full right of appeal.

5.   Mr Tufan conceded that therefore the  decision  of  the  judge  in  the
    First-tier was made in error and that therefore the  appeal  should  be
    remitted to the First-tier for a hearing afresh on all issues.

6.   It is appropriate therefore that I set aside the decision of the  judge
    in the First-tier and direct that the appeal be remitted to the  First-
    tier for a further decision.



Notice of Decision

The appeal is allowed to the extent  that  it  is  remitted  for  a  hearing
afresh and the First-tier Tribunal on all issues.

No anonymity direction is made.
