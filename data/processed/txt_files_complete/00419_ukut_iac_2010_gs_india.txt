                                                                   Appellant
                                     And

                     Entry Clearance Officer, New Delhi
                                                                  Respondent



Paragraph 6C of the Immigration Rules specifies that an applicant for  entry
clearance whose arrival would cause an increase in  the  tax  credits  which
his sponsor is already receiving will (in contrast to in-country  applicants
under paragraph 6B) be regarded as having recourse  to  public  funds.   But
where the applicant will be joining a spouse or partner who is both  working
and bringing up children, the amount of  working  tax  credit  payable  will
actually be reduced.  That is because the sponsor will lose the lone  parent
supplement which forms part of the working tax credit.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.  On 10 March 2010 the appellant's application for entry  clearance  as  a
spouse was  refused  on  the  sole  ground  that  he  did  not  satisfy  the
requirement of paragraph  281(v)  of  the  Immigration  Rules  for  adequate
maintenance to be available without (additional) recourse to  public  funds.
His wife lives in Dudley with her two children from a previous marriage  and
has a low-paid job, the income from which is  supplemented  by  working  tax
credit and child tax credit.  On appeal,  Immigration  Judge  Mathews  found
that the sponsor's weekly income from all sources of  �575  was  well  above
the �361 which a 'comparator' family of two adults and  two  children  would
receive on Income Support, but  he  dismissed  the  appeal  because  of  two
things which he thought might go up  if  the  appellant  were  to  join  the
sponsor's household.  The first was the rent, the second was the  amount  of
tax credit which would be payable.

2.  The first of these was not mentioned by the ECO and was  not  raised  at
the hearing.  I granted leave to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  because  the
judge had not informed the parties that this matter was troubling  him,  and
given them an opportunity to address it.  That seemed a clear error of  law.
 As it  turns  out,  on  subsequent  inquiry  being  made,  Jephson  Housing
Association have provided a letter dated 9 August 2010 confirming  that,  if
another adult were to move into the sponsor's house, the rent would  not  go
up.

3.  That leaves the question of tax  credits.   Nothing  has  been  received
from the respondent since the grant of  permission  to  appeal,  so  when  I
issued a combined 'Decision & Directions' on 14 September, I  set  aside  IJ
Mathews' decision for legal error, and requested from  the  parties  written
submissions and documentary evidence on how the  appellant's  arrival  would
affect the position vis-�-vis tax credits.  I would then proceed to  re-make
the decision without a hearing.

4.  Only one side has responded.  Mr Khera of Sehgal  &  Co.  has  helpfully
provided written submissions  and  two  further  documents:  a  Home  Office
leaflet, giving guidance to  the  public  on  what  it  means  to  have  'no
recourse to public funds', and a  copy  of  the  Tax  Credits  (Immigration)
Regulations 2003, made under section 42 of the Tax Credits  Act  2002.   The
latter sets out a general rule at reg 3(1), "No person is entitled to  child
tax  credit  or  working  tax  credit  while  he  is  a  person  subject  to
immigration control."  But there are a number of exceptions,  including  reg
3(2):

      "(2) Where one member of a married couple or  unmarried  couple  is  a
      person subject to immigration control, and the other member is not ...


     a) the calculation of the amount of tax  credit  under  the  Act,  the
        Child Tax Credit Regulations and the Working Tax Credit Regulations
        ...,
     b) the method of making (or proceeding with)  a  joint  claim  by  the
        couple, and
     c) the method of payment of the tax credit,

      shall ... be determined in the same way as if  that  person  were  not
      subject to such control."

5.  The effect of this is reflected  at  paragraph  6B  of  the  Immigration
Rules, as it was when it was inserted from 15 March 2005:

      "6B. A person shall not be regarded as having recourse to public funds
      if he is a person who is not excluded from  specified  benefits  under
      section 115 of the Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  1999  by  virtue  of
      regulations made under sub-sections (3) and (4)  of  that  section  or
      section 42 of the Tax Credits Act 2002."

6.  If that paragraph still governed applications for  entry  clearance,  Mr
Khera's submission would be correct:

      "In essence, the presence of the Appellant entering the United Kingdom
      may in fact affect the tax credits the Sponsor would receive but  this
      would not affect the application for entry clearance."

7.  Since 31 March 2009, however, that is no longer the case.  On that  date
a new para  6C  was  added  to  HC  395  (with  para  6B  being  amended  in
consequence), which makes  a  distinction  between  in-country  and  out-of-
country applications:

      "6C. A person (P)  making  an  application  from  outside  the  United
      Kingdom will be regarded as having recourse to public  funds  where  P
      relies upon the future entitlement  to  public  funds  that  would  be
      payable to P or to P's sponsor as a result  of  P's  presence  in  the
      United Kingdom (including those benefits to which  P  or  the  sponsor
      would be entitled as a result of P's presence in  the  United  Kingdom
      under the regulations referred to in paragraph 6B)."

8.  In the instant case, if the  appellant's  arrival  from  India  were  to
result in increased tax credits being  payable,  then  he  would  indeed  be
regarded as having recourse to public funds.   Fortunately  for  him,  there
are documents in the previous Appellant's Bundle which  indicate  that  such
is not likely to be the case.  A communication from  HM  Revenue  &  Customs
sets out the sponsor's award of tax credits for  the  period  in  which  the
decision under appeal falls.  It contains the following information:

      "You must tell us if you marry or enter into a civil  partnership,  or
      start to live with someone as  if  you  are  married  or  in  a  civil
      partnership.  This award will then end, and you will need  to  make  a
      new claim with your partner, if appropriate."

9.  Until the appellant arrives in the United Kingdom and  a  new  claim  is
made, we simply do not know  whether  the  tax  credits  will  go  up.   But
looking at the 'elements' of which tax credits are made up, as tabulated  by
HMRC in the sponsor's assessment, it would seem that the  child  tax  credit
payable on account of the sponsor's two children would not be  increased  by
the appellant's arrival, although it  could  be  reduced  if  the  household
income were to increase.  On the  other  hand,  the  sponsor's  working  tax
credit might well go down, because there is a 'lone  parent'  element  which
she would lose once she ceases to be a lone parent.  Of  course,  the  claim
as a single parent would be replaced by a claim  as  a  couple.   But  as  I
understand it, a parent bringing up children on her (or his)  own  generally
does get more in the way of working tax credits than a couple with  children
who are working and earning a similar amount.  Critics  of  the  tax  credit
scheme have gone so far as to say  that  it  threatens  the  institution  of
marriage.  Whatever the ramifications for social policy,  for  the  purposes
of immigration appeals it needs to be borne in mind that  an  appellant  who
is seeking a visa as the spouse or partner of a  sponsor  with  children  is
likely to cause a reduction  rather  than  an  increase  in  the  amount  of
working tax credit payable.

10.  There has not yet been a 'reported' case on tax credits,  and  the  way
in which this complex benefit operates is  not  well  known  to  immigration
judges or, I dare  say,  to  entry  clearance  officers.   At  the  date  of
decision  in  the  present  case,  the  sponsor  was  receiving  an  income,
inclusive of tax credits, well above what a family of  two  adults  and  two
children would have been receiving on Income Support,  which  is  considered
the benchmark of adequacy for the purposes of  the  Immigration  Rules.   It
was not known, at the date of decision, what amount of tax credits would  be
payable on the appellant's joining the sponsor's household, as a  new  claim
would have to be made, but it could not be made until  after  the  appellant
had joined the household.  But  it  seems  most  unlikely  to  me  that  the
present weekly income of �575 would need to be increased overall on  account
of the appellant's arrival.  In the circumstances, it is only fair to  allow
the appeal.


DECISION

11. The appeal is allowed.
