Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms C Taroni, Richmond Chambers LLP
For the Respondent:    Mr D Clarke, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a national of India who  appeals  with  permission  to
    the  Upper  Tribunal  against  the  decision  of  a  First-tier   Judge
    dismissing her appeal against the decision of the Secretary of State of
    28  April  2017  refusing  to  issue  her  with  a  residence  card  as
    confirmation of a right to reside in the United Kingdom pursuant to the
    Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations  2016  ("the   EEA
    Regulations").

2.   Following a hearing on 16 August  2019  a  panel  consisting  of  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Rintoul and Upper Tribunal Judge Owens  found  that  the
    decision of the First-tier Judge was infected by error of  law  and  it
    was set aside and the matter was listed for rehearing in its  entirety.
    A copy of that decision is annexed to this decision.

3.   By way of essential background we note  that  the  appellant,  who  had
    lived in India since her birth in 1961, went to live with her son,  the
    sponsor, in Ireland in August 2015.  He had gone there in July 2015  to
    work.  Her son is her  only  child.   He  left  home  in  around  2000,
    according to his witness statement, when he went to Australia to  study
    for a degree and stayed on working in Australia and eventually obtained
    Australian citizenship in 2006.  After his father's death  in  2007  he
    visited his mother in India and, having met his wife in 2008  in  India
    he joined her in the United Kingdom from  2008  onwards  working  there
    until he went to Ireland to work in 2015.  The  appellant  returned  to
    the United Kingdom from Ireland on 26 August 2016 and subsequently made
    the application, the refusal of which is the subject of this appeal.

4.   At the outset of the hearing it  was  made  clear  by  Mr  Clarke  that
    consequent upon the error of law decision and the decision of the Upper
    Tribunal in ZA [2019] UKUT 281 (IAC), it was accepted on behalf of  the
    respondent that the sponsor should be treated as an  EEA  national  for
    the purposes of Regulation 9 of the EEA Regulations.   The  sole  issue
    was that of dependency.

5.   The sponsor, Mr Ankur Pankajbhai Desai adopted  his  witness  statement
    as his evidence-in-chief.

6.   In cross-examination he said that, with regard to the business  of  the
    appellant referred to in her visit visa application in 2011, a business
    which it was said she had run since 1990, she ran a small salon in  the
    city where they lived.  He was asked when the business closed and  said
    it was since his father died in 2007 that his mother ran it but she was
    trying to keep herself busy with it and it was closed when she  visited
    the United Kingdom and finally closed in  2015  when  she  came  for  a
    visit.  It was her own business.

7.   He was asked whether she also had a residential property in  India  and
    said yes, with his father.  He was asked when both were sold  and  said
    that they had a flat which was the family home.  On  paper  his  mother
    owned it but it was really a family home.   As  to  when  the  business
    premises were sold he did not know when that had happened.  He did  not
    think that anybody other than  his  mother  owned  the  business.   His
    mother did not have other relatives in India and he was the  only  son.
    As to when the business was sold or  whether  the  money  went  to  his
    mother he said he did not know what had happened.  She did not  have  a
    pension from the business.  It was a very  small  salon.   He  did  not
    think that she had had any employees.  Most of his time had been  spent
    outside India and he did not know the day-to-day stuff.

8.   He did not think that when his mother came to  the  United  Kingdom  in
    2015 the business was run by anyone else.

9.   He was referred to the Bank of Baroda account that his mother held  and
    said he thought she still had that account.  He did  not  know  whether
    she held any other bank accounts.  He was aware of the Bank  of  Baroda
    account because he had sent money to it.  He did not know whether there
    was a lack of income from the business.  It was  insufficient  so  they
    had sent her financial aid.

10.  He was asked about the Hong Kong entry stamp in his  mother's  passport
    and said that it was entry and exit on the same day and he guessed they
    had a rule to stamp it, and she had never  visited  Hong  Kong  but  it
    could be a transit stop on the way to Australia.

11.  There was no re-examination.

12.  The next witness was the appellant who adopted  her  witness  statement
    as her evidence-in-chief.  She confirmed that it had been read  to  her
    in Gujarati or another language that she  understood,  before  she  had
    signed it.

13.  In cross-examination she was referred to the visit visa application  in
    2011 and agreed that it confirmed she was a business owner at the time.
     The business was a beauty parlour which was owned by her  husband  and
    gradually it had been slowed down.  As to  whether  they  had  had  any
    employees she said there was one helper who helped in the house as well
    and if there was free time helped with  the  business  also.   She  was
    asked whether this person had continued to run the  business  when  she
    herself had come to the United Kingdom before 2015 and  said  that  her
    own health was up and down and the helper did not run the business.  It
    was closed down in 2015.

14.  She was asked whether the business was in  a  property  she  owned  and
    said yes, it was with the house and in the same property  as  her  home
    and they were together.  They still had that  home.   It  was  for  her
    children.

15.  She was referred to the fact that in his evidence her son had  referred
    to two properties, a flat and holiday home and the  business  premises,
    as a separate property.  She said that downstairs there was  the  salon
    and the kitchen and upstairs was the flat.

16.  Her son had first gone to Australia  for  studies  about  twenty  years
    ago.  She agreed that in the visit visa application she  had  said  the
    business had been owned since 1990.  She was asked  why  then  her  son
    would think that the business was in a separate property  when  he  had
    come home to visit the family home.  She said that before it was rented
    the business was somewhere  else  and  then  it  was  brought  to  this
    property, so when he  left,  the  business  was  somewhere  else.   Her
    husband had died eleven years ago.

17.  She was asked when they moved the business  into  their  home  and  she
    said it was slow in the rented place and hence they moved  it  and  she
    had had health issues as well.  She thought that it had been moved into
    their  home  ten  or  fifteen  years  ago  and  then  her  health   had
    deteriorated.

18.  She was asked whether her son did not visit her  after  2005  in  India
    and she said he used to come every year.  She was asked  why  therefore
    he did not know the business was downstairs in the family home and  she
    said the business was very slow.  She was asked whether in fact she had
    a business in another property and was  not  being  truthful  about  it
    being downstairs in the home and she said that it was not true that the
    business was somewhere else.

19.  She was referred to the HSBC bank statements at  page  309  onwards  in
    the bundle and was asked whether she had any other  bank  accounts  and
    she said it was only the money her son used to send.  When the question
    was repeated she said no and then was asked whether she  had  ever  had
    any other bank accounts.  She had said  there  was  a  Bank  of  Baroda
    account but there was no money in it and her son had sent money through
    that bank.  She had not had a bank account for the business.

20.  She was asked about the payment into the account on 17 August 2019,  at
    page 317 of the bundle, and she said that her son would have  deposited
    it.  She was asked why if he was putting in regular amounts anyway this
    would be done and whether it was needed for anything in particular  and
    she said her memory was not so  good.   She  did  not  have  any  other
    sources of income than her son.  She no longer had the Bank  of  Baroda
    account.  She had not been back for the past five years.  It was put to
    her that she was not dependent on her son as  she  did  not  need  this
    money and she said no, they were the ones who  were  paying  everything
    for her and were looking after her in the house.  She  had  had  health
    problems.

21.  We asked the appellant about the payment of �500 out of the account  on
    15 August 2019.  She said it could be for her travelling.   They  would
    have done the transaction and they put the money in and out.  By "they"
    she meant her son and daughter-in-law.  She said that if  the  children
    needed the money they would take it out.  She was asked why they  would
    need to take �500 from her account for travelling and she said  it  was
    not for travelling but for other expenses and they were  putting  money
    in and if they needed it they were taking it out.

22.  With regard to the Bank of Baroda account there was no money  there  so
    the account was closed.  We asked whether she had taken steps to  close
    it.  She said that in India if there was no activity in an account then
    it stopped.  She had not received a letter from the  bank.   There  had
    been no money in the account.

23.  On re-examination the  witness  estimated  that  her  income  from  the
    business before she came to the United Kingdom was 2 to  3  lakh  rupee
    per annum which equated to �2,000-2,500 roughly.  With regards the Bank
    of Baroda account there was money from her son as well and it had  been
    for her health problems and expenses.

24.  With regard to the �4,891.27 paid in by the sponsor in  2013  she  said
    it was for things like weddings and other social events.  She was asked
    how she paid her bills in India and  said  there  was  electricity  and
    groceries and shopping.  The income from the business was not enough to
    meet her bills.

25.  The next witness was the sponsor's wife, Mrs Dhruti Ankur  Desai.   She
    adopted her witness statement as her evidence-in-chief.

26.  Mr Clarke had no questions for her.

27.  We asked whether she knew about the  �500  taken  from  her  mother-in-
    law's account as recorded at page 317 of the bundle and  said  she  did
    not know and nor did she know about the cash paid in on 17 August 2019.



28.  In his submissions Mr Clarke relied  on  the  decision  in  Lim  v  ECO
    (Malaysia) [2015] EWCA Civ 1383 with regard to the test for  dependency
    as to whether the person was able to support themselves even  if  given
    financial support by the EU national.  He argued that the  evidence  of
    the appellant's true financial affairs was inconsistent and  too  vague
    for the Tribunal to be satisfied that she was  not  in  a  position  to
    support herself.   There  were  inconsistencies  about  the  background
    business and finances of the appellant.

29.  It could be seen from Annex D to the  explanatory  statement  that  she
    had had the business since 1990 and had made the visit visa application
    then.  Her son had gone to Australia twenty years  previously  but  was
    back every year.  Her son's evidence was that they had two  properties,
    the flat/house and  a  separate  business  premises.   The  appellant's
    evidence was that in fact it was a house with the home and the business
    in the building.  She said the business moved downstairs in  2005.   It
    should be questioned why the son would not be aware  of  this  when  he
    visited and the only explanation was that someone was lying and it  was
    far more likely that an attempt was being made to cover up the finances
    to show dependency on the son.

30.  With regard to the most recent bank  statements,  there  were  the  �25
    regular payments by the sponsor every month, but they were anomalies as
    could be seen at page 317 of the bundle which showed  a  lot  of  money
    going into the account: �990, but no explanation for it  and  this  was
    unfathomable.  It was indicative of an attempt to hide the true picture
    of the finances.  The  Bank  of  Baroda  account  had  been  relied  on
    previously.  It was argued that there was a deliberate attempt  not  to
    disclose other accounts or the picture with regard to the business  and
    the Lim test was not made out.

31.   In  her  submissions  Ms  Taroni  argued  that  the  burden  of  proof
    concerning dependency had been  discharged.   The  appellant  had  been
    issued a residence card in Ireland as a family member and was dependent
    on her son and his wife.  Contrary to what Mr Clarke had argued,  there
    were no inconsistencies.  The appellant had explained that there was  a
    business premise and her son was unclear whether it was rented or  not.
    After the appellant's husband had died the salon had been brought  into
    the house and that was unsurprising.  Her  son  would  not  necessarily
    observe that there was a lot of equipment as there  was  little  to  be
    seen.  There was nothing to support the allegation of lying.

32.  The appellant had explained that she received the  equivalent  of  some
    �2,000 income from the business and this was inadequate to support  her
    in India.  The evidence at page 350 to page 374 and the table supported
    that.  There was evidence from 2012 onwards.

33.  As regards there being no evidence of the liabilities  and  dependency,
    the Home Office guidance said that Pedro was still  to  be  relied  on.
    There was the guidance  at  page  19,  this  being  the  February  2019
    guidance.  The dependency did not have to have  existed  for  a  person
    going to the United Kingdom.  As to what  the  position  would  be  now
    there was no evidence of withdrawals from the Bank of  Baroda  account.
    There was no detail of the expenditure, it  was  accepted.   There  was
    oral evidence that she used the money for bills and that there  was  no
    other issue.  There was  nothing  to  suggest  that  the  business  was
    ongoing.  It was relied on in the 2011 application  but  that  was  not
    inconsistent with it  slowing  down,  and  bearing  in  mind  also  the
    appellant's health issues.  As regards the evidence from India, the son
    paid all the bills including expenses and medication which was  ongoing
    in the United Kingdom and the son and his wife supported the appellant.
     Dependency should be found to exist.

34.  We reserved our decision.

35.  In light of Mr Clarke's  concession  on  behalf  of  the  Secretary  of
    State,  the  only  issue  that  remains  to  be  resolved  is  that  of
    dependency.

36.  The legal test is that set out in Lim at paragraph  25.   There  it  is
    said that it is not enough simply to show that financial support is  in
    fact provided by the EU citizen to the family member, but also that the
    family member must need this support from his or her relatives in order
    to meet his or her basic needs.  As was further said at paragraph 32:

         "If he can support himself, there is no dependency, even if  he  is
         given  financial  material  support  by  the  EU   citizen.   Those
         additional resources are not necessary to enable him  to  meet  his
         basic needs. If, on the other hand, he cannot support himself  from
         his own resources, the court will not ask why  that  is  the  case,
         save perhaps where there is an abuse of rights."

The Evidence

37.  In her witness statement the appellant said that  it  was  planned  for
    her to come to the United Kingdom for a long visit to her son  and  his
    wife and children, in June 2015.  After  he  was  offered  the  job  in
    Ireland and his wife and the  children  were  to  stay  in  the  United
    Kingdom she travelled to Ireland with him  in  August  2015.   She  had
    planned to spend time with him and return to  the  United  Kingdom  but
    partly because his wife and children had stayed in the  United  Kingdom
    and partly because of his concerns about her, her son felt it would  be
    best if she stayed with him.  She had previously  been  diagnosed  with
    hypothyroidism, with uncomfortable symptoms, and in Ireland her  health
    worsened and in December 2015 following some health  problems  she  was
    diagnosed with ulcerative colitis.  She was hospitalised for 28  nights
    and her son looked after her, together with his wife and  children  who
    came on regular visits.  She said that her son spent time working  from
    home so he could care for her.

38.  Earlier in her statement she said that after her husband died  in  2007
    her son began to assist her financially  and  over  the  years  as  she
    became older she became increasingly dependent on him.   From  December
    2012 to May 2015 he wire-transferred on average �300 a month  from  his
    UK bank account to her bank account in India.  After the return to  the
    United Kingdom in 2016 her treatment continued.   Her  son  transferred
    �25 into her bank account on a weekly basis to  pay  for  her  personal
    needs and travel.  She relies on her son to arrange her healthcare  and
    ensure she is looked after.

39.  We have set out above her oral evidence.

40.  In his witness statement the sponsor said that from  May  2012  to  May
    2015 he transferred on average �300 a month to his mother in India.  He
    had a job working for CPA Global in London and that job came to an  end
    in 2014 and he then looked for jobs  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  was
    contacted by an agency with regard to a job in  Ireland  which  he  was
    offered and accepted.  His wife was not keen to move at the time due to
    having her own career and concerns about moving if things did not  work
    out, so it was agreed that he would go there and she would  visit  with
    the children to explore  social  and  professional  life  there  before
    making her decision on a permanent move.

41.  It had originally been intended that his mother  would  stay  with  him
    for a short period but he  became  worried  about  her  health  and  in
    particular after the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis  he  was  able  to
    work remotely and spent a great deal of time at home looking after  her
    and managing domestic arrangements.

42.  His wife did not wish to leave the United Kingdom and  her  life  there
    and after spending a significant time in Ireland they both realised the
    Indian community  there  was  significantly  smaller  than  the  United
    Kingdom so it was decided to return to the United Kingdom.   Since  his
    return he had set up a weekly transfer of �25 a week to his mother from
    about May/June 2018 and before that he transferred on an ad hoc  basis.
    He said that his mother did  not  have  any  other  source  of  regular
    income.

43.  In her witness statement the sponsor's wife confirmed the  reasons  for
    her and the children not going to Ireland and the reasons  for  wishing
    to remain in the United Kingdom and hence her husband and his  mother's
    return to the United Kingdom.  She confirmed that her husband transfers
    money to his mother's UK bank account on a weekly basis and  also  that
    he was supporting her financially and emotionally before they  went  to
    Ireland.

44.  The documentary evidence confirms the regular  �25  per  week  payments
    made by the sponsor to the appellant since their return to  the  United
    Kingdom.  There are also some payment confirmations  of  payments  into
    the appellant's Bank of Baroda account, it appears from the sponsor, on
    various dates between 2012 and 2015.

45.  Doubts have been raised about the truthfulness of  the  evidence  given
    with regard to dependency.  In particular  Mr  Clarke  raised  concerns
    about whether or not the appellant retained the beauty  salon  business
    which she said had been  closed  in  2015,  noting  that  there  was  a
    discrepancy between her evidence that the business  was  moved  to  the
    ground floor of the residence in which the family has  a  flat  and  in
    which she lived previously, having been moved ten or fifteen years  ago
    and the sponsor's evidence, at variance to this, bearing in  mind  that
    the sponsor had visited every  year  prior  to  coming  to  the  United
    Kingdom and then moving to Ireland.  Concerns were  also  raised  about
    unexplained payments into and out of the appellant's HSBC  account,  in
    particular a payment out of �500 on 15 August 2019  and  a  receipt  of
    �990 on 17 August 2019.  The sponsor was not asked about these and  the
    appellant was vague about them.

46.  As against that is the evidence  of  the  payments  into  the  Bank  of
    Baroda account between 2012 and 2015, referred to above, as well as the
    ongoing payments of �25 a week.  As Ms Taroni argued, the fact that the
    appellant relied on the existence of the salon in 2011 is in  no  sense
    inconsistent with the business having slowed down and ultimately  being
    closed subsequently.  It is also relevant to note  that  the  appellant
    was granted a residence permit by the Irish authorities.

47.  Bringing these matters together, though we  have  some  concerns  about
    the discrepancies in respect of the business and to a lesser extent the
    payments in and out of the account in August 2019, this taken  together
    is not enough in our view to displace the positive matters relied on by
    the appellant in particular as  set  out  in  the  witness  statements.
    Going back to the guidance  in  Lim,  we  consider  that  it  has  been
    established on  a  balance  of  probabilities  that  the  appellant  is
    dependent on the sponsor in that she cannot support  herself, since  we
    are satisfied that the business from which she  previously  derived  an
    income no longer exists, and she has no other sources of income.  As  a
    consequence dependency is made out and the appeal is allowed.

48.  No anonymity direction is made.

                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                                    ORDER

 1. The application  made  by  the  appellant  to  admit  further  evidence
    pursuant to rule 15(2A) of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
    Rules 2008 is granted as I am satisfied that it is in the  interests of
    justice.

 2. A Gujarati interpreter is to be booked for the hearing.

 3. On 11 August 2015 the appellant  went  to  live  with  the  sponsor  in
    Ireland who had gone there on 15 July 2015 to work.   She  returned  to
    the United Kingdom on 26 August 2016 (where she had arrived  originally
    as a visitor on 25 June 2015).  The  sponsor  returned  to  the  United
    Kingdom on 6 September 2016.

 4. The Secretary of State was not satisfied that the sponsor's  employment
    in Ireland was genuine concluding that the purpose of the residence  of
    the sponsor and the appellant in Ireland was to circumvent  the  United
    Kingdom domestic Immigration Rules or other immigration law.

 5. The appeal was first heard by the First-tier Tribunal on  16  May  2018
    when it was dismissed for the reasons set out in a decision of  7  June
    2018.  Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal  was  granted  on  13
    December 2018 and the matter then came before the Upper Tribunal on  29
    January 2019.  For the reasons set out in the decision of 6 March  2019
    it was remitted to the First-tier Tribunal.

 6. The judge heard evidence  from  the  appellant,  the  sponsor  and  the
    sponsor's wife finding that:

      i) the main issue was to  determine  whether  the  sponsor's  move  to
         Ireland to work was to take up genuine employment there or  whether
         it was simply to circumvent the United Kingdom's Immigration  Rules
         to secure status for his mother in the United Kingdom [28];

     ii) the most important factor into determining the genuineness  of  the
         sponsor's move to Ireland is whether he transferred his  centre  of
         life to Ireland [28];

    iii) the sponsor's move to  Ireland  and  residence  there  as  well  as
         employment was not genuine, noting that the sponsor  had  left  his
         wife and children both of whom were under 5 [29],  there  being  no
         credible evidence that he could not find employment locally;

     iv) there is no  evidence  that  the  appellant  had  previously  taken
         employment in another EU state [30] there was no credible reason to
         explain why he had returned to the United Kingdom after only a year
         [30].

      v) there was no credible explanation  as  to  why  the  appellant  had
         followed her son to live in Ireland when she had no reason to  stay
         in the United Kingdom with her  daughter-in-law  and  grandchildren
         [32]; the explanation given - that she was there to cook  food  for
         the sponsor - was not credible, the true motivation being to obtain
         a residence card there as a family member of the sponsor and return
         to the United Kingdom thereby circumventing the  Immigration  Rules
         [33];

     vi) Neither the sponsor nor the appellant had integrated  into  society
         in Ireland [34].

 7. The appellant sought permission to appeal on the grounds that the judge
    had erred;

      i) in attaching undue weight to the centre of life test this not being
         the sole or primary test;

     ii) in failing to consider whether Regulation 9(3)(a)  is  an  accurate
         transposition of EU law; the "centre of life test" having no  basis
         in the case law for the CJEU the judge failing properly to apply  O
         & B v (Netherlands) [2014] EUECJ C-456/12;

    iii) the judge had approached the question of abusive rights incorrectly
         failing to have regard to Emsland-St�rke  [2000]  ECR  I-11569  the
         judge incorrectly referring to  the  sponsor's  employment  as  not
         being genuine yet failing properly to apply the test as to  whether
         his employment was genuine as set out in Lawrie-Blum [1996] EECJ C-
         66/A5 and Levin [1982] EUECJ R-53/81; and, in failing  properly  to
         direct himself in line with Gureckis [2017] EWHC  3295  (Admin)  in
         particular at [82];

     iv) in failing to take  into  account  as  a  relevant  matter  that  a
         residence card had been  issued  to  the  appellant  by  the  Irish
         authorities and in failing properly to take into  account  evidence
         of integration in Ireland as well as taking into account irrelevant
         matters.

The Law

 8. The starting point is that the sole ground of appeal in  this  case  is
    whether the decision of the respondent was  in  breach  of  the  United
    Kingdom's obligations under the EU treaty.  The central issue  in  this
    case is correct interpretation of Regulation 9 of the 2016  Regulations
    which (as at the date of decision) provide as follows:-

         9.-(1) If the conditions in  paragraph  (2)  are  satisfied,  these
         Regulations apply to a person who is the family member ("f") of  an
         British Citizen ("BC") as though the BC were an EEA national

    (2)  The conditions are that-

            (a)   BC-

                  (i)  is residing in  an  EEA  State  as  a  worker,  self-
                  employed person, self-sufficient person or a  student,  or
                  so resided immediately  before  returning  to  the  United
                  Kingdom; or

                  (ii) has acquired the right of permanent residence  in  an
                  EEA State;

            (b)   F and BC resided together in the EEA State; and

            (c)   F and BC's residence in the EEA State was genuine.

         (3)  Factors relevant to whether residence in the EEA State  is  or
            was genuine include-

            (a)   whether the centre of BC's life transferred  to  the  EEA
                  State;

            (b)   the length of F and  BC's  joint  residence  in  the  EEA
                  State;

            (c)   the nature and quality of the F and BC's accommodation in
                  the EEA State, and whether it is  or  was  BC's  principal
                  residence;

            (d)   the degree of F and BC's integration in the EEA State;

            (e)   whether F's first lawful residence in the EU with BC  was
                  in the EEA State.

         (4)  This regulation does not apply-

            (a)   where the purpose of the residence in the EEA  State  was
                  as a means for circumventing any immigration laws applying
                  to non-EEA nationals to which F would otherwise be subject
                  (such as any applicable requirement under the 1971 Act  to
                  have leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom); or

            [(b)  to a person who is only  eligible  to  be  treated  as  a
                  family member as a result  of  regulation  7(3)  (extended
                  family members treated as family members).[1]]"

 9. In ZA (Reg 9. EEA Regs; abuse of rights) Afghanistan  [2019]  UKUT  281
    (IAC) the Upper Tribunal held:

    (i)  The requirement to have transferred the centre of  one's  life  to
    the host member state is not  a  requirement  of  EU  law,  nor  is  it
    endorsed by the CJEU.

    (ii) Where an EU national of one state ("the home  member  state")  has
    exercised the right of freedom of movement to take  up  work  or  self-
    employment in another EU state ("the host state"), his  or  her  family
    members have a derivative right  to  enter  the  member  state  if  the
    exercise of Treaty rights in the host state was "genuine" in the  sense
    that it was real, substantive, or effective. It is for an appellant  to
    show that there had been a genuine exercise of Treaty rights.

    (iii)    The question of whether family  life  was  established  and/or
    strengthened, and whether there has been a genuine exercise  of  Treaty
    rights requires a qualitative assessment which  will  be  fact-specific
    and will need to bear in mind the following:

         (1)  Any work  or  self-employment  must  have  been  "genuine  and
         effective" and not marginal or ancillary;

         (2)  The assessment of whether a stay in the host state was genuine
         does not involve an assessment of the  intentions  of  the  parties
         over and above a consideration of whether what they intended to  do
         was in fact to exercise Treaty rights;

         (3)  There is no requirement for the EU national or his  family  to
         have integrated into the host member state, nor for the sole  place
         of residence to be in the host state; there is  no  requirement  to
         have severed ties with the home member  state;  albeit  that  these
         factors may, to a limited degree, be relevant  to  the  qualitative
         assessment of whether the exercise of Treaty rights was genuine.

    (iv) If it is alleged that the stay in the host member state  was  such
    that reg. 9 (4) applies, the burden is on the  Secretary  of  State  to
    show that there was an abuse of rights.

10. We turn also to O. and B. where the ECJ held at [54] to [57]:
    53   On the other hand, an obstacle such as that referred to in
    paragraph 47 above may be created where the Union citizen intends to
    exercise his rights under Article 7(1) of Directive 2004/38. Residence
    in the host Member State pursuant to and in conformity with the
    conditions set out in Article 7(1) of that directive is, in principle,
    evidence of settling there and therefore of the Union citizen's genuine
    residence in the host Member State and goes hand in hand with creating
    and strengthening family life in that Member State [Emphasis added].
    54   Where, during the genuine residence of the Union citizen in the
    host Member State, pursuant to and in conformity with the conditions
    set out in Article 7(1) and (2) of Directive 2004/38, family life is
    created or strengthened in that Member State, the effectiveness of the
    rights conferred on the Union citizen by Article 21(1) TFEU requires
    that the citizen's family life in the host Member State may continue on
    returning to the Member of State of which he is a national, through the
    grant of a derived right of residence to the family member who is a
    third-country national. If no such derived right of residence were
    granted, that Union citizen could be discouraged from leaving the
    Member State of which he is a national in order to exercise his right
    of residence under Article 21(1) TFEU in another Member State because
    he is uncertain whether he will be able to continue in his Member State
    of origin a family life with his immediate family members which has
    been created or strengthened in the host Member State (see, to that
    effect, Eind, paragraphs 35 and 36, and Iida, paragraph 70).
    55   A fortiori, the effectiveness of Article 21(1) TFEU requires that
    the Union citizen may continue, on returning to the Member State of
    which he is a national, the family life which he led in the host Member
    State, if he and the family member concerned who is a third-country
    national have been granted a permanent right of residence in the host
    Member State pursuant to Article 16(1) and (2) of Directive 2004/38
    respectively.
    56   Accordingly, it is genuine residence in the host Member State of
    the Union citizen and of the family member who is a third-country
    national, pursuant to and in conformity with the conditions set out in
    Article 7(1) and (2) and Article 16(1) and (2) of Directive 2004/38
    respectively, which creates, on the Union citizen's return to his
    Member State of origin, a derived right of residence, on the basis of
    Article 21(1) TFEU, for the third-country national with whom that
    citizen lived as a family in the host Member State.
    57   It is for the referring court to determine whether sponsor O and
    sponsor B, who are both Union citizens, settled and, therefore,
    genuinely resided in the host Member State and whether, on account of
    living as a family during that period of genuine residence, Mr O. and
    Mr B. enjoyed a derived right of residence in the host Member State
    pursuant to and in conformity with Article 7(2) or Article 16(2) of
    Directive 2004/38.

11. It is also of relevance to consider what was said in Eind [2007]  EUECJ
    C-291/05

    33   In their written observations, the Netherlands and Danish
    Governments contended that a Community national is unlikely to be
    deterred from moving to the host Member State in order to take up
    gainful employment there by the prospect of not being able, on
    returning to his Member State of origin, to continue a family life
    which may have been established in the host Member State. In
    particular, the Netherlands Government emphasised the fact that Mr Eind
    could not have been deterred from exercising that freedom, through
    moving to the United Kingdom, by the fact that it would be impossible
    for his daughter to reside with him once he returned to his Member
    State of origin, given that at the time of the initial move Miss Eind
    did not have a right to reside in the Netherlands.


    34   That approach cannot be accepted.


    35   A national of a Member State could be deterred from leaving that
    Member State in order to pursue gainful employment in the territory of
    another Member State if he does not have the certainty of being able to
    return to his Member State of origin, irrespective of whether he is
    going to engage in economic activity in the latter State.


    36   That deterrent effect would also derive simply from the prospect,
    for that same national, of not being able, on returning to his Member
    State of origin, to continue living together with close relatives, a
    way of life which may have come into being in the host Member State as
    a result of marriage or family reunification.

    37   Barriers to family reunification are therefore liable to undermine
    the right to free movement which the nationals  of  the  Member  States
    have under Community law, as the right of a Community worker to  return
    to the Member State of which he is a national cannot be  considered  to
    be a purely internal matter.

12. In the light of this, we find no merit in the submission from Mr Clarke
    that Regulation 9(3) reflects the factors to be taken into account in O
    and B.  The ECJ emphasised that the residence must be genuine which  is
    a qualitative assessment and what was stated at [56] must  be  read  in
    the light of what was said  at  [53],  in  particular  the  highlighted
    passage set out above.

13. It is to be borne in mind that restrictions on free movement are, as is
    the consistent jurisprudence of the ECJ to be  construed  narrowly.  We
    consider that there is no basis for the assertion that O and B  somehow
    overrides or is inconsistent with Akrich as is clear from Gureckis.

14. We accept that it is open to the state to set out  tests  to  determine
    indicative  criteria  to  assess  whether  residence  is  genuine   and
    effective but what is meant by "genuine" and "effective" must  be  seen
    through the light of O and B.  Further, genuine and effective  must  be
    properly understood.  In the EU context "genuine" is not  the  opposite
    of false it is simply that something has substance.

15. In the light of these observations  we  consider  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal judge misdirected himself in law to a serious extent and in  a
    manner which  infected  the  findings.   There  is  no  basis  for  the
    assertion that the centre of life test is important let alone the  most
    important test.  On the contrary, what is required  is  the  evaluation
    set out in O and B.

Abuse of Rights

16. The correct test for abuse of rights is clear from  Emsland-St�rke,  as
    referred to in  Gureckis.   Further,  the  intentions  behind  somebody
    seeking employment in another state are not relevant.  See Akrich.

17. We note Mr Clarke's submission that the issue in this case  is  whether
    the appellant (as opposed  to  the  sponsor)  exercise  of  rights  was
    abusive.  We consider that in any event this point is moot;  the  judge
    simply fails properly to apply the abuse of rights test.

18. Accordingly, for these reasons, we are satisfied that grounds 1  and  2
    are made out as well as is ground 3.

19. In the circumstances, and given that on that  basis  the  findings  are
    unsafe and the appeal must be set aside, it is unnecessary  for  us  to
    consider whether also ground 4 is made out.

20. Accordingly, for these reasons, we are satisfied that the  decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error of law and  set
    it aside.  We consider that  none  of  the  findings  of  fact  can  be
    preserved and that accordingly the matter will need to  be  reheard  in
    its entirety.  We are, however, satisfied that it would be  appropriate
    to retain this in the Upper Tribunal for a full fact-finding  exercise.



21. We note, however, that there is an issue raised in the  refusal  letter
    which  does  not  appear  to  have  been  addressed  in  the   previous
    determination, that is, whether the appellant's mother  is  in  fact  a
    dependant.  There is prima facie evidence that that is so in  the  form
    of the issue to her by the Irish authorities of a residence card as the
    dependant relative in the ascending line. This is nonetheless a  matter
    which will need to be considered.

Notice of Decision

 1. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law and we set it aside.  None of the findings of fact are
    preserved.

 2. The appeal will be remade in the Upper Tribunal on a date to be fixed.

 3. The parties are to proceed on the basis that the Upper Tribunal will
    hear oral evidence and to inform the Upper Tribunal if an interpreter
    is required.

 4. The parties are to exchange skeleton arguments 5 days before the
    hearing.
