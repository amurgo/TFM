Representation:
For the Appellant:     Miss K Moffatt, counsel by Direct Access
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals against the decision of the Secretary of State to
    refuse her human rights claim on 27 December 2019.  Her appeal  against
    that decision was dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge Steer for  the
    reasons given in her decision of 7 April 2020.  For the reasons set out
    in my decision of 29 September 2020, that decision was set aside on the
    basis it involved the making of an  error  of  law.   A  copy  of  that
    decision is attached to this decision.

 2. This decision must be read in connection with the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal which found that:

      i) The appellant and  Mr  Allen  were  in  a  genuine  and  subsisting
         relationship and that they intend to marry [58];

     ii) The appellant did not, however, meet the  definition  of  "partner"
         within GEN 1.2 of Appendix FM owing to the  lack  of  cohabitation,
         and so the appellant could not rely on paragraph EX.1 [44] to [48];

    iii) The appellant did not meet the requirements  of  paragraph  276ADE,
         given her age and as she had not spent 20 years in the UK, nor  had
         she  shown  there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to  her
         integration into Jamaica [51];

     iv) Family life exists between the appellant, her adult brother and his
         children [60];

      v) The appellant would not face insurmountable obstacles to continuing
         family life with Mr Allen in Jamaica [69];

 3. The hearing on 18 March 2021 was unusual in that it  commenced  on  the
    basis of submissions only,  it  becoming  apparent  only  during  those
    submissions that it would be necessary to hear evidence both  from  the
    appellant and her brother, Mr Chin, in respect of  the  health  of  her
    nephew.

 4. The appellant adopted her witness statement  explaining  that  she  had
    initially lived with her brother when she came to the United Kingdom in
    2006 and had then moved to Essex as it  was  easier  for  her  studies.
    Although she had moved back in with the family, she had continued  flat
    sharing for some period moving  in  with  her  brother  permanently  in
    October 2018.  Mr Chin explained that his oldest  son  suffers  from  a
    serious illness, BSEP deficiency.  This is a genetic disorder which  he
    has had since birth and requires regular stays in hospital, as well  as
    extensive medication.  The illness has now  progressed  to  the  extent
    that he will now have to undergo a liver transplant and  is  under  the
    care of the specialist unit at King's College Hospital,  London.   This
    is, on any view, a serious illness, which in a child inevitably  places
    stress on the family as a whole.

 5. It also emerged in evidence that the appellant has been a major part of
    his life since he was very young, approximately 2  years  of  age,  and
    that she has during his recent stays in hospital stayed there with  him
    in the position of a parent as  it  has  not  been  possible  for  both
    parents to do so and they have other duties given that they have  small
    children.  They also work full-time.

 6. I found the appellant to be a credible and compelling  witness.   I  am
    satisfied by her explanation as to the apparent discrepancies, when she
    was living with her brother or not.  He appeared  at  the  time  to  be
    somewhat confused but I bear in mind he had not been expecting to  give
    evidence and was doing so over a video link.

 7. I am satisfied by the evidence that the appellant  has  formed  a  very
    close bond with her nephew.  This is I accept due in part to the nature
    of his illness and that she has been a carer for  him,  assisting  with
    sorting out medication and being with him in hospital.  I bear in  mind
    also the strain that would be placed on the family such as  this  where
    the older child has a life limiting condition which  has  progressively
    worsened since he was a child.  In the circumstances, I  am  satisfied,
    looking at the evidence as a whole that the  bond  is  unusually  close
    given the support offered as is the bond between the appellant and  her
    brother and sister-in-law, as well as the other nephews and nieces.

 8. I note the appellant's argument that there is no public interest in her
    removal and that this  would  be  dispositive  of  the  proportionality
    assessment, relying on Parveen [2018] EWCA Civ 932.

 9. I do not accept that the overstaying in this  case  is  of  the  nature
    entirely like that in Parveen.  I accept the appellant  had  been  here
    for  a  significant  number  of  years,  legitimately,  and  that   her
    overstaying resulted from her not being able to continue her studies as
    she no longer met the requirements of the Immigration Rules  for  leave
    to remain as a student.  I do not consider that she was  without  fault
    as she knew she could not meet  the  requirements  of  the  Immigration
    Rules but equally, there was no element of dishonesty here.

10. I accept that the nature of the relationship between the appellant  and
    her nephew is such that it cannot be sustained by video  and  telephone
    calls.  It is a relationship based on close contact which has developed
    over a number of years, most of  his  life,  and  which  could  not  be
    maintained in such a way. I take note in particular the stress that  he
    is undergoing at present given that he faces a serious operation in the
    form of a liver transplant.

11. Looking at the evidence as a whole, I  am  not  satisfied  that  it  is
    entirely certain that the appellant would be granted entry clearance to
    join her fianc�.  That said, that is because I do not have full  copies
    of all the relevant documents relating to their finances.  These are  a
    requirement of Appendix FM-SE.  In addition, and this is not meant as a
    criticism, it would be necessary for there to be documents showing  the
    plans for the wedding to take place.  Given it  is  accepted  that  the
    relationship is genuine it is almost certain that these documents could
    be provided.

12. I find that there is  not,  in  this  case,  any  indication  that  the
    appellant  falls  within  the  terms  of  paragraph  320  (11)  of  the
    Immigration Rules or its successor, paragraph  9.8.2,  there  being  no
    evidence that she has contrived in a significant way to  frustrate  the
    intention of the rules, or there are other aggravating circumstances.

13. That  said,  for  these  reasons,  the  appellant  does  not  meet  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules.

14. I turn next to whether, nonetheless, and applying section 117B  of  the
    2002 Act, it would nonetheless be disproportionate to  require  her  to
    leave the United Kingdom.

15. In assessing this issue, I bear in mind that there is a  strong  public
    interest in the maintenance of immigration control.

16. In terms of the length of time that would be required for the appellant
    to spend outside the United Kingdom, I do  not  accept  the  submission
    from Miss Moffatt that this would be at least four months.  It  is  not
    possible to read over from the findings in Younas (section  117B(6)(b);
    Chikwamba; Zambrano) [2020] UKUT 129 (IAC) that  this  would  apply  in
    applications from Jamaica and equally given current  circumstances  and
    the difficulties of flying from the United Kingdom to Jamaica and  back
    I accept it would be difficult to quantify how long any gap  would  be.
    I do, however, accept that it would be a matter of months, rather  than
    weeks and I do not accept that time need necessarily be  spent  outside
    the  United  Kingdom  preparing  the  application.   All  the  relevant
    documents relating to finances are present in the  United  Kingdom  and
    this is where any wedding would take place.  The application  could  be
    prepared ready to submit on her return to Jamaica.

17. That said, I agree that there is some diminution in the public interest
    in this case given that it is close to inevitable  that  she  would  be
    granted entry clearance.  I find no basis on which  it  could  be  said
    that she fails to meet the suitability requirements.

18. I accept that the appellant is able  to  speak  English  and  would  be
    financially independent and equally I find that little weight could  be
    attached to the relationship with her partner given that she  was  here
    at all times unlawfully.  Equally her private life would be  of  little
    weight given that  it  was  established  when  her  presence  here  was
    precarious.  I consider, however, that Section 117B(4) of the 2002  Act
    has limited applicability to the relationship she has  with  her  other
    family.

19. Having heard the evidence of  the  appellant  and  her  brother,  I  am
    satisfied  that  there  would  be  a  significant   impact   on   their
    relationship and more particularly the relationship she  has  with  her
    nephew who she has been supporting  throughout  his  illness  for  many
    years. The relationship is a very close one, and I accept on the  basis
    of the evidence I heard that there is significant emotional  dependency
    on both sides. I accept also that this support  has  recently  included
    staying with the nephew in hospital during the restrictions imposed  by
    the current pandemic; that has assisted him and his  parents  who  have
    two other younger children to care for.

20. I consider that the effects on the nephew of separation  would  be  all
    the greater given that he faces a liver transplant and given that, that
    it would be unclear how long she would have to spend outside the United
    Kingdom given current  conditions.   I  accept  also  that  she  has  a
    subjective fear of having to return to Jamaica but I find that a little
    wait that would be caused to her by having to remain in her family home
    in Jamaica pending the consideration of an application to return.

21. The effect of removal on the family life she has with her nephew who is
    particularly vulnerable would be severe. He would no  longer  have  the
    regular, day to day help  and  support  she  provides,  nor  could  she
    provide the care and support to him while he is in hospital. That could
    not, without a significant and serious effect on their other  children,
    be provided by the parents. There would inevitably be distress to him.

22. Taking all these factors into account I consider that whilst no single
    one of them is determinative, bearing in mind the effect on the  family
    life she has with her nephew  who  is  particularly  vulnerable,  I  am
    satisfied on the particular and compelling emotional  circumstances  of
    this case sufficient to outweigh the  public  interest  in  maintaining
    immigration control and for these  reasons  I  am  satisfied  that  the
    removal of the appellant would be in breach of Article 8.  I  therefore
    allow the appeal on that basis.

Notice of Decision

 1. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law and I set it aside.

 2. I remake the appeal by allowing it on human rights grounds.

                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                           DECISION AND REASONS[1]

 1. The appellant appeals with permission against the  decision  of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Steer promulgated on 7 April 2020.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Jamaica who appealed against the decision
    made on 6 November 2029 to refuse her application for leave  to  remain
    on a human rights basis. That in turn was  based  on  her  relationship
    with Mr J Allen, a British  Citizen,  and  with  her  brother  and  his
    children.

 3. The appellant arrived in the United Kingdom with  leave  as  a  Tier  4
    Student on 30 September 2006. Her leave to remain in that capacity  was
    later extended. Her leave became exhausted on  17  may  2014,  but  she
    remained. Further  submissions  for  leave  to  remain  were  made  and
    refused. An asylum claim made  in  2017  was  refused  and  the  appeal
    against that decision was dismissed, all appeal rights being  exhausted
    by 8 June 2018. Further unsuccessful applications  followed,  the  last
    being on 14 October 2019, the refusal  of  which  gives  rise  to  this
    appeal.

 4. The respondent did not accept that the appellant met the requirement of
    the Immigration Rules and concluded  that  in  all  the  circumstances,
    removal was proportionate.

 5. The  appellant  and  Mr  Allen  gave  evidence  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  The judge found that:

      i) The appellant and  Mr  Allen  were  in  a  genuine  and  subsisting
         relationship and that they intend to marry [58];

     ii) The appellant did not, however, meet the  definition  of  "partner"
         within GEN 1.2 of Appendix FM owing to the  lack  of  cohabitation,
         and so the appellant could not rely on paragraph EX.1 [44] to [48];

    iii) The appellant did not meet the requirements  of  paragraph  276ADE,
         given her age and as she had not spent 20 years in the UK, nor  had
         she  shown  therE  would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to  her
         integration into Jamaica [51];

     iv) Family life exists between the appellant, her adult brother and his
         children [60];

      v) The appellant would not face insurmountable obstacles to continuing
         family life with Mr Allen in Jamaica [69];

     vi) Little weight was to be  attached  to  the  appellant's  family  or
         private life [78] given that her position here had been precarious;

    vii) The appellant had not provided the specified or any  evidence  that
         she met the financial requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules  for
         leave to enter as a fianc�e or partner [78]; and, as this was not a
         very clear case, she could not be certain that the appellant  would
         be granted Entry Clearance and  so,  could  not,  applying  Agyarko
         [2017] UKSC 10 and R (ota Kaur v SSHD [2018] EWCA  Civ  1423  could
         not be satisfied that  there was no public interest in her  removal
         as had been the case in Chikwamba [2008] UKHL 40

 6. The appellant sought permission to appeal on the grounds that the judge
    had erred in her analysis of proportionality because she had failed:

      i) to note that the respondent had in the refusal letter accepted that
         the financial requirements  had been met and so her conclusion that
         they had  not  been  met  was  flawed  and  so  her  rejecting  the
         application of Chikwamba in assessed the public interest in removal
         was flawed;

     ii) to take into account the  family  life  that  existed  between  the
         appellant, her brother and his children, in particular  failing  to
         consider the children's best interests; and,

    iii) to take into account  the  appellant's  immigration  history;  and,
         failed properly to follow Younas  (section  117b(60(b);  Chikwamba;
         Zambrano)  [2020]  UKUT  00129  in  considering   the   degree   of
         culpability and deception involved

 7. On 21 July 2020 Upper Tribunal Judge Stephen Smith  granted  permission
    on all grounds stating:-

         ".... It is arguable that the judge founded her application of  the
         [Chikwamba] doctrine on an erroneous view of the facts. At [78] the
         judged held that the appellant did not provide  the  specified,  or
         any  evidence,  concerning  her  ability  to  meet  the   financial
         requirements of the rules. Arguably that was in error  because,  at
         page  4  of  the  respondent's  refusal  lettered...the  respondent
         accepted that the appellant met the financial  requirements  of  E-
         LTRP 3.1 to 3.4. Arguably  the  appellant's  ability  to  meet  the
         financial requirements was not in issue between the parties.  While
         it is well established that the mere likely ability to  meet  entry
         clearance  requirements is not, in isolation, determinative of  the
         abs3ence of the public interest in event  temporary  removal...(see
         Younas...), it is unarguably necessary for a "Chikwamba" assessment
         to be founded on a correct understanding of the factual  matrix  of
         the case.

 8. Judge Stephen Smith also made directions in this case stating:

        1. I have reviewed the file in this case.   In  the  light  of  the
           present need to take precautions against the spread of Covid-19,
           and  the  overriding  objective  expressed  in   the   Procedure
           Rules[2], I have reached the provisional view,  that it would in
           this case be appropriate to determine  the  following  questions
           without a hearing:

           a) whether the making  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal's  decision
              involved the making of an error of law, and, if so

           b) whether that decision should be set aside.

        2. I therefore make the following DIRECTIONS:

           i) The appellant may submit further submissions  in  support  of
              the assertion of an error of law, and on the question whether
              the First-tier Tribunal's decision should  be  set  aside  if
              error of law is found, to be filed and served  on  all  other
              parties no later than 14 days after this notice is  sent  out
              (the date of sending is on the covering  letter  or  covering
              email);

          ii) Any other party may file and serve submissions  in  response,
              no later than 21 days after this notice is sent out;

         iii) If submissions are made in  accordance  with  paragraph  (ii)
              above the party who sought permission to appeal may file  and
              serve a reply no later than 28 days after this notice is sent
              out.

          iv) All submissions that rely  on  any  document  not  previously
              provided to all other parties  in  electronic  form  must  be
              accompanied by electronic copies of any such document.

        3. Any party who considers that despite the foregoing directions  a
           hearing is necessary  to  consider  the  questions  set  out  in
           paragraph 1 (or either of them) above must  submit  reasons  for
           that view no later than 21 days after this notice  is  sent  out
           and they will be  taken  into  account  by  the  Tribunal.   The
           directions in paragraph 2 above must be complied with  in  every
           case.

        4. If this Tribunal decides to set aside the decision of the First-
           tier  Tribunal  for  error  of  law,  further  directions   will
           accompany the notice of that decision.

        5. Documents and submissions filed in response to these  directions
           may be sent by, or attached to, an email to  [email]  using  the
           Tribunal's  reference  number  (found  at  the  top   of   these
           directions) as the subject line.  Attachments must not exceed 15
           MB.  This address is not generally available for the  filing  of
           documents.  Service on the Secretary of State may be to  [email]
           and to the original appellant, in the absence  of  any  contrary
           instruction, by use of any address apparent from the service  of
           these directions.

 9. The appellant sent an email to the Upper Tribunal on 12 August  stating
    that she would not be making further  submissions  at  this  point  but
    reserving the option to reply to any submissions from the respondent.

10. The respondent has made no submission, and thus  neither  she  nor  the
    appellant has made any  objection  to  this  matter  being  dealt  with
    without a hearing.

11. The Tribunal has the power to make the decision without a hearing under
    Rule 34 of the Procedure Rules.  Rule 34(2) requires me to have  regard
    to the views of the parties.  Given that no objection to this course of
    action has been raised, and bearing in mind the overriding objective in
    Rule 2 to enable the Tribunal to deal with cases fairly and  justly,  I
    am satisfied that in the particular circumstances of this case where no
    objection to a decision being made in the absence of a hearing that  it
    would be right to do so.  I find no[3] merit in the grounds of  appeal.



12.  The  challenge  in  the  grounds  is  limited  to  the  assessment  of
    proportionality, it being accepted that the appellant does not meet the
    requirements of the immigration rules as, although engaged to marry  Mr
    Allen, cannot be his fianc�e for the purpose of the rules  as  she  was
    not granted entry clearance in that capacity.

13. As Judge Stephen Smith noted when granting permission, it  is  accepted
    that the applicant met the financial requirements  of  the  rules;  she
    also  met  the  English  language  requirement  and   the   suitability
    requirements. Given the finding that the relationship with Mr Allen  is
    genuine and subsisting, and as paragraph 320 (7B) would  not  apply  to
    the appellant by operation of A320, the only apparent  basis  on  which
    there could be a refusal of entry  clearance  is  paragraph  320  (11).
    There is, however, little in the material indicating  that  this  could
    properly be invoked.

14. That does now, however, mean that the appeal should have succeeded. The
    Upper Tribunal addressed Chikwamba in Younas at [78]  ff,  setting  out
    the steps that ought to be taken. Some of those were undertaken, albeit
    not in the same order, and the judge did not have the benefit of Younas
    when preparing her decision; it was not published until 17 April,  well
    after she had signed her decision.

15. Unlike in Younas there is no assessment of the appellant's  immigration
    history, in terms of whether it was poor or not; there are no  findings
    on the circumstances of her overstaying and while there is, properly an
    assessment pursuant  to  section  117B,  this   does  not  include  any
    analysis of the effect on the appellant's brother's  children,  despite
    the judge having made findings that a family life with them exists.

16. In the light of that failure and the error of fact made,  the  decision
    did involve the making of an error of law. I consider that in  all  the
    circumstances, and in the absence of submissions to the  contrary  from
    the respondent, that it is material.

17. Accordingly, for these reasons, I conclude that  the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error of law as  claimed.
    I therefore set it aside to be remade in  the  Upper  Tribunal  on  the
    basis that the findings of  fact,  with  the  exception  of  the  error
    relating to the meeting of the financial requirements,  are  preserved.
    That includes the findings as to family life and the relationship being
    genuine and subsisting. There does not appear to be any  need  for  the
    Upper Tribunal to hear further oral evidence.

Notice of Decision

      1. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the  making  of
         an error of law and I set it aside.

      2. I direct that the decision be remade in the  Upper  Tribunal  on  a
         date to be fixed.

      3.  Any  party  wishing  to  adduce  further  evidence  must  make  an
         application pursuant to rule 15  (2A)  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
         (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 at least 10  working  days  before  the
         hearing.
