For the Appellant:           Mr Wood, IAS (Manchester)
For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Honduras born in 1989.   His  dependants
    are his wife and five children. They seek international  protection  on
    the grounds that they have a well-founded fear of persecution in  their
    home country for reasons of their membership  of  a  particular  social
    group/political opinion. The Respondent  rejected  that  claim  on  the
    grounds that it was not credible. The First-tier  Tribunal  (Designated
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal McClure) agreed  and  the  appeal  was
    dismissed. The Appellant now  has  permission  to  appeal  against  the
    decision.


 2. The basis of the family's claim to protection was that they  are  at  a
    real risk of harm in their home area of Villanueva from an  armed  gang
    known as MS-13. MS-13 had imposed upon the  Appellant  an  Impuesto  de
    Guerra - a 'war tax' - a sum to be paid each month on  pain  of  death.
    The Appellant paid the money regularly before he and his  wife  decided
    that they could not pay anymore. They arranged to  leave  the  country,
    having first sought internal flight to La Libertad for  about  a  month
    before boarding their flights.

 3. Judge McClure did not  accept  that  this  claim  engaged  the  Refugee
    Convention. The gang's actions were solely motivated by money, and  the
    evidence does not disclose some ulterior political  motive,  either  on
    their part, or on the part of the Appellant in refusing to pay. Nor did
    he find the claim to be consonant with the country background material,
    which indicated that MS-13 seek to avoid local confrontations  and  are
    not therefore routinely involved  in  extortion,  other  than  at  high
    level, involving for  instance  big  transport  companies.   There  was
    further inconsistency in the  chronology  in  that  the  Appellant  had
    apparently remained in Villenueva for two months without  paying  MS-13
    the money, and yet they had taken no action against him.  His  stay  in
    La Libertad whilst waiting for a visa was further inconsistent with his
    claimed fear. Overall Judge McClure was not satisfied that  the  burden
    of proof has been discharged, even  to  the  lower  standard,  and  the
    appeal was dismissed.



    The Appeal

 4. The Appellant was granted permission to appeal to this Tribunal on  the
    27th February 2020 by  Designated  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Macdonald. The sole ground  at  that  stage  was  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal had erred in failing to make any findings on the  evidence  of
    the Appellant's wife,  who  had  provided  detailed  written  and  oral
    evidence in support of her husband's account. The failure to make  such
    findings amounted, it was submitted, to an error of law: AK (Failure to
    assess witnesses' evidence) Turkey [2004] UKIAT 00230.


 5. Shortly after permission was granted the  United  Kingdom  entered  its
    first 'lockdown' of the Covid-19 pandemic. There was, as a result, some
    delay in dealing with this appeal. On the 1st April 2020 Upper Tribunal
    Judge Pitt gave directions indicating her  provisional  view  that  the
    preliminary stage of this appeal - determining whether  the  First-tier
    Tribunal decision should be set aside for error of law - could be  deal
    with on the papers.  She invited written submissions from the parties.

 6. The Tribunal received the Appellant's 'Further Submissions' on the 18th
    May 2020. These expand generally on the issue raised  on  the  grounds,
    and then say this:

         "the Appellant anticipates that the Respondent will seek  to  argue
         that any failure to provide a particularised finding on the  wife's
         evidence  is  immaterial  due  to  other  reasons  given  by  Judge
         McClure".



    In such anticipation, the Written Submissions raise a number  of  other
    points about the First-tier Tribunal's findings. In  particular  it  is
    submitted that the Tribunal erred in making  a  partial  and  selective
    reading of the country background evidence, and in making a  number  of
    mistakes of fact.

 7. The Secretary of State responded on the 21st  May  2020  by  way  of  a
    'Skeleton Argument' written by Senior Presenting Officer  Mr  C  Bates.
    In respect of the primary ground the  Secretary  of  State  did  indeed
    assert that any failure to make findings on  the  wife's  evidence  was
    immaterial, but not for the reasons  foreshadowed  by  the  Appellant's
    written submissions. Rather  Mr  Bates  simply  pointed  out  that  the
    accounts of both husband and wife were broadly consistent,  and  so  it
    followed from the findings made against the Appellant that  his  wife's
    account was similarly rejected.   In respect of the new matters  raised
    in the written submissions,  Mr  Bates  objects  on  the  grounds  that
    permission has not been granted on those points.


 8. In compliance with Judge Pitt's Directions  the  Secretary  of  State's
    'Skeleton Argument' was followed by the "Appellant's  Response  to  the
    Respondent's Further  Submissions"  dated  the  26th  May  2020.   This
    document largely consists of quite unnecessary repetition, but it  also
    makes clear that it is not  the  Appellant's  intention  to  raise  new
    grounds of appeal: the points about the mistakes of fact etc are simply
    made in order to counter any allegation of immateriality.

 9. The file was reviewed by Upper Tribunal Judge Finch on the 19th  August
    2020, who decided that in the circumstances  a  live  'remote'  hearing
    would be in the interests of justice.  She gave liberty to  apply,  but
    neither party did. The appeal was  accordingly  listed  for  the  first
    available date, and this was how  it  came  before  me.  I  heard  oral
    submissions from both representatives for  which  I  am  grateful,  and
    particular thanks must go to Mr Wood who assisted both  myself  and  Mr
    McVeety by providing an electronic set of papers enabling the  case  to
    proceed in the absence of the file, which due to  administrative  error
    had not arrived with me in time for  the  hearing.  I  confirm  that  I
    received the file shortly  after  the  hearing  and  I  have  read  its
    contents in light of the submissions  that  I  heard.   I  reserved  my
    decision which I now give.



    Error of Law: Discussion and Findings


10. I deal first with the ground of appeal that was considered arguable  by
    Judge Macdonald. In AK (Failure to assess witnesses'  evidence)  Turkey
    [2004] UKIAT 00230 the Upper Tribunal directed that where witnesses are
    called to give evidence, findings should be made on such evidence:

         The necessity to make proper findings of fact in  relation  to  all
         the oral evidence, and not merely that given by the  appellant,  is
         one which is being  overlooked  by  adjudicators  with  unfortunate
         frequency.  For that reason, it is intended that this determination
         should be reported for the  guidance  of  adjudicators  as  to  the
         necessity to make proper  findings  on  the  evidence  of  all  the
         witnesses called before them.

11. Here, the  Secretary  of  State  accepts,  the  Appellant's  wife  gave
    evidence broadly consistent with his own.  That  being  the  case,  she
    argues,  there was no need for Judge McClure to make separate  findings
    on her testimony. The case was rejected, it is  submitted,  because  it
    "ran  contrary  to  the  background  evidence",  and  because   "lacked
    credibility".  That reasoning of the First-tier Tribunal,  submits  the
    Secretary of  State,  should  be  read  as  "equally  applicable  to  a
    rejection of the wife's evidence".


12. The Secretary of State has, with these submissions,  defeated  her  own
    argument on two fronts.

13. First, they serve to  support  the  Appellant's  contentions  that  the
    matters raised in the written submissions are indeed admissible  as  an
    answer to an allegation of immateriality.  If  the  answer  to  the  AK
    (Turkey)  ground  is  to  point  to  the  findings  on  the  background
    information and credibility issues, it is incumbent upon me to  see  if
    those findings were of sufficient  strength  to  uphold  the  decision,
    notwithstanding any error in the failure to assess the wife's evidence.
    Although it would clearly have been preferable had these  matters  been
    advanced as grounds of appeal,  in presenting them in this way Mr  Wood
    has performed the neat trick  of  smuggling  them  into  the  pleadings
    without having leave to do so.

14. Second, in her acknowledgement that the evidence of two witnesses, both
    tested under cross examination, was broadly consistent,  the  Secretary
    of State has illustrated the real difficulty with the decision. It is a
    matter  of  weight.   The  consistent  evidence  of  two  witnesses  is
    logically capable of attracting  greater  weight  that  the  consistent
    evidence of one. Although the decision refers to the fact that the wife
    was called to give evidence [at �28], nowhere are any findings made  on
    her testimony.  That is an omission amounting to an error  of  law:  AK
    (Turkey).

15. If any further illustration is necessary, I note that the omission  has
    direct bearing on one of the factual errors identified by Mr  Wood.  At
    its �49 the Tribunal draws adverse inference from what  it  understands
    the evidence to be: "there was no suggestion that the gang called [for]
    the money in either December or January and the appellant has not given
    any satisfactory explanation why they  did  not".  In  fact,  the  oral
    evidence was that the gang were last paid off in January, and that  the
    family left the country a few weeks later, before the next payment  was
    due. I can see from the record of proceedings that this  was  a  matter
    expressly canvassed in the cross examination of the Appellant's wife:

    "Q. Between last payment and the time you left- did you rec any threats
    from the gang?


    A. Last payment Jan - went to mothers  for  the  last  3  weeks  before
       coming here. We did not have any more contact with them in February"

16. Accordingly, I am satisfied that decision of the First-tier Tribunal is
    flawed for error of fact in  respect  of  the  evidence,  and  for  the
    failure to consider the evidence of a witness.


17. It follows that I need not say much about the other points raised by Mr
    Wood.   I  accept  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  misunderstood   the
    chronology and imported into  its  reasoning  something  that  did  not
    feature at all in the evidence: it wrongly believed that the Appellants
    would need United Kingdom visas before leaving, when in fact  Hondurans
    were at that time non-visa nationals.  As for the plausibility  of  the
    account Mr McVeety may well be correct to say that the general tenor of
    the reports is that the gangs would not bother with 'small fry' such as
    the  Appellant,  but  the  country  background  evidence  is   not   so
    unequivocal that the possibility of this claim being plausible could be
    excluded.

18. The decision is therefore set aside in its entirety, and  the  decision
    needs to be remade.   The parties agreed that in the circumstances  the
    most appropriate forum for than would be the First-tier Tribunal.



    Anonymity Order

19. This appeal concerns a claim for protection.  Having had regard to Rule
    14 of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  and  the
    Presidential Guidance Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity Orders  I  therefore
    consider it appropriate to make an order in the following terms:


         "Unless and until a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his
        family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
        Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
        direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"




    Decision and Directions


     1. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.


     2. The decision in the appeal  is  to  be  remade  in  the  First-tier
        Tribunal


     3. There is an order for anonymity.
