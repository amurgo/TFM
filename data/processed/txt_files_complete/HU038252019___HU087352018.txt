For the appellant:     Mr J. Gajjar, instructed by Eldons Berkeley
Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr C. Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    The first appellant is the main appellant ("the  appellant")  and  his
      wife is his dependent for the purpose of this  appeal.  The  appellant
      appealed the respondent's decision dated 14 February 2019 to refuse  a
      human rights claim.

2.    First-tier Tribunal Judge A.K.  Hussain  dismissed  the  appeal  in  a
      decision promulgated on 07 August 2019.

3.    The  Upper  Tribunal  found  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  decision
      involved the making of an error of law in a decision promulgated on 04
      December 2019 (annexed). The Upper Tribunal upheld some parts  of  the
      First-tier Tribunal decision but found that there was an error of  law
      relating to the judge's assessment of the overall  balancing  exercise
      under Article 8. The judge failed to make findings regarding  material
      matters that were relevant to the weight to be  given  to  the  public
      interest considerations. Although negative findings  relating  to  the
      allegations of deception  would  have  yielded  the  same  outcome,  a
      positive finding might have affected the weight that should  be  given
      to the appellant's side of the scale.

4.    The Upper Tribunal made clear that  the  scope  of  the  remaking  was
      narrowed to (i) findings of fact relating to the general  grounds  for
      refusal; and (ii) how those findings impact on the  overall  balancing
      exercise under Article 8.

5.    A chronology of events may assist in understanding the  background  to
      the case.  I  have  highlighted  relevant  applications  for  ease  of
      understanding given the proliferation  and  layering  of  applications
      made by the appellant in recent years.

           23/09/05    Appellant entered the UK with leave to  enter  (LTE)
                       as a student valid until 31/03/07. An application for
                       further leave to remain (LTR) was refused on 25/04/07
                       with a right of appeal. It is said that the appellant
                       withdrew the appeal and made a  voluntary  departure,
                       but it is not clear what date he left the UK.

           25/01/09    Entered the UK with LTE  as  a  Tier  1  (Post-study

           25/02/20    Upper Tribunal hearing to remake the decision in the
                 human rights appeal

Decision and reasons

6.    The appeal was relisted for hearing  primarily  to  make  findings  of
      fact relating to the general grounds of refusal under paragraph 322(2)
      and 322(5) of the immigration rules because  the  First-tier  Tribunal
      failed to do so.

7.    This decision is not concerned with the ongoing  proceedings  relating
      to the refusal of ILR as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant  but  the  reasons
      for refusal were same as the  decision  to  refuse  the  human  rights
      claim. Both applications were refused under the  general  grounds  for
      refusal and for the same underlying reasons.

8.    I note that the appellant did  not  act  promptly  to  file  the  most
      recent judicial review claim which sought to challenge the second  PBS
      decision dated 04 December 2018. Instead, he waited until the last day
      of the extended three-month deadline before filing the claim. By  that
      time, he and his representatives would have been fully  aware  of  the
      fact that he had lodged an appeal to the First-tier  Tribunal  against
      the decision to refuse the human  rights  claim.  The  Upper  Tribunal
      Judge who granted permission on the papers was unlikely to be aware of
      this fact, which was omitted from the  chronology  of  events  in  the
      Statement of Grounds.  While  I  appreciate  that  the  appellant  was
      seeking to challenge a decision relating to  a  separate  application,
      given the fact  that  the  same  issues  are  at  the  heart  of  both
      decisions,  those  who  assisted  him  to  make  the  judicial  review
      application should have been alive to their duties  to  the  court  if
      they knew that the appellant had a full fact finding appeal  available
      to him in which further  evidence  could  be  produced  to  rebut  the
      allegations. Nevertheless, the Secretary of  State  should  have  been
      aware of that fact when she  agreed  to  settle  the  claim.  A  third
      decision relating to the PBS application is awaited.

9.    The appellant continues to assert that the chronology  outlined  above
      shows that he met the  requirements  for  10  years  lawful  residence
      because it is argued that leave  extended  under  section  3C  of  the
      Immigration Act 1971 was  'revived'  upon  the  Secretary  of  State's
      withdrawal of the first and second PBS decisions.

10.   Whether it is possible for section 3C leave to be 'revived'  in  light
      of the statutory framework is a matter  that  will  only  need  to  be
      determined if the respondent fails to show that the decision to refuse
      the human rights claim was justified because the general  grounds  for
      refusal applied. The application would  normally  be  refused  if  the
      appellant fell within the general grounds for refusal  with  reference
      to paragraph 276B(iii) of the immigration rules. For  this  reason,  I
      will start by considering the general grounds for refusal first.

General grounds for refusal

11.   At the date of the decision to refuse the human  rights  claim  on  14
      February 2019 the respondent was not satisfied that the appellant  had
      at least 10 years continuous  lawful  residence.  In  any  event,  the
      application was refused with reference to paragraph 276B(ii)(c) of the
      immigration rules which states that there must be no  reasons  why  it
      would be undesirable for the person to  be  granted  ILR  taking  into
      account  his  personal  history,  including  character,  conduct   and
      associations. The application  was  also  refused  with  reference  to
      paragraph 276B(iii) which states that the applicant must not fall  for
      refusal under the general grounds for refusal. The respondent went  on
      to consider whether the appellant's character and  conduct  were  such
      that he fell within the general grounds for refusal

12.   Paragraph 322(2) of the immigration rules states that  an  application
      for leave to remain should normally be refused if there is  a  failure
      to disclose a material fact or false representations were made in  the
      application for leave to remain or a previous application.

13.   Paragraph 322(5) states  that  an  application  for  leave  to  remain
      should normally be  refused  if  it  is  undesirable  for  the  person
      concerned to remain in the United Kingdom in  light  of  his  conduct,
      character or  associations  or  because  he  represents  a  threat  to
      national security.

14.   The respondent highlighted two areas of concern, which both relate  to
      the appellant's application for leave to remain as a Tier 1  (General)
      Migrant in 2010. The first is an allegation that  the  appellant  made
      false representations and/or  produced  false  documents.  The  second
      allegation is that the appellant used deception by  falsely  inflating
      his  income  for  the  purpose  of  the  immigration  application,  or
      alternatively, failed to declare his income for the purpose of his tax
      obligations.

15.   Although the focus of each allegation is slightly  different,  at  the
      core of both is the suggestion that the  appellant  may  have  falsely
      inflated his claimed self-employed earnings for the year 2010-2011  in
      order to meet the income requirements of  the  immigration  rules.  In
      such circumstances it is appropriate to consider the  evidence  as  it
      relates to both allegations before coming to a decision.  My  task  is
      made more difficult by the fact that little evidence has been produced
      by either party relating to the application for leave to  remain  made
      in 2010. It is not possible to obtain a clear picture of  the  figures
      the appellant put forward or to assess what evidence was  produced  to
      support the application. Although  some  documents  contained  in  the
      appellant's bundle might have been included with  the  application  in
      2010, they are patchy and incomplete. The  application  was  initially
      refused, but the subsequent appeal  was  allowed.  Neither  party  has
      produced a copy of the relevant First-tier Tribunal decision.

16.   In relation to the first area of concern, the appellant  was  required
      to show  a  minimum  level  of  income  of  for  the  purpose  of  the
      immigration rules. There does not appear to be any  evidence  to  show
      what level of income, and therefore what points the appellant claimed,
      when he first applied for leave to remain as  a  Tier  1  Migrant.  In
      2010, the minimum level of  income  required  by  Appendix  A  of  the
      immigration rules was �16,000. The evidence shows that the appellant's
      employed income was likely to be below the minimum level  of  required
      income. In the relevant period before the  application  for  leave  to
      remain the appellant claimed that he earned �11,928  from  employment.
      In other words, the appellant had to rely on self-employed  income  in
      order to meet the requirements  for  leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  1
      Migrant.

17.   The appellant says that his  self-employed  income  was  derived  from
      selling the personal data of people who had been involved in accidents
      to third parties. At the time when he made the application  for  leave
      to remain in 2010,  he  says  that  he  was  trading  under  the  name
      Addonnet. One of the few documents  relevant  to  this  period  is  an
      undated summary of income prepared by PKG Plus  Chartered  Accountants
      for a three-month period from  25  June  2010  to  30  September  2010
      [pg. F106]. It is not clear whether this document was sent  with  the
      2010 application for leave to remain or formed part of the  assessment
      when he amended his tax return for 2010-2011 in 2015.  In  any  event,
      the appellant relies on it as a summary of his self-employed  earnings
      during the tax year  2010-2011.  The  schedule  details  ten  invoices
      issued at regular intervals during a six-week period  from  16  August
      2010 to 29 September 2010. The schedule records that the invoices were
      paid, also at regular intervals, over the period 19 August 2010 to  23
      October 2010.  Most of the invoices were issued to  named  individuals
      and were for similar amounts of between �3,500-�3,800.  Only  one  was
      issued to a company, "Iwin Technological Ltd", on  16  September  2010
      for �5,000. The schedule records that "Iwin  Technological  Ltd"  paid
      the invoice on 29 September 2010. The total income said to  have  been
      earned in the three-month period was �40,765.

18.   When the appellant applied for leave to remain in  November  2010,  he
      claimed to have earned �39,068 from self-employment in the  qualifying
      period preceding the application. The figure of �40,765  contained  in
      the schedule is consistent with the  calculations  submitted  to  HMRC
      when the appellant amended the 2010-2011 tax return in 2015  before  a
      deduction of �1,696.67 for expenses [pg. G12].  The  net  income  from
      self-employed work  was  amended  to  �39,068.  In  other  words,  the
      schedule is said to  represent  the  appellant's  total  self-employed
      earnings during the 2010-2011 tax year.

 19.  The respondent alleges that Iwin Technologies  Ltd  was  complicit  in
      the recycling of funds to help people to obtain  leave  to  remain  by
      deception. She produced a  witness  statement  from  an  investigating
      officer  from  the  Home  Office  Immigration  Crime  Team.  Operation
      Cudgegong commenced in September 2012 and finished in July  2016.  The
      operation investigated organised abuse of the Tier  1  (General)  visa
      system  by  Indian  nationals.  The  investigation  featured   several
      companies, which on further examination, did not undertake  legitimate
      trading. The bank accounts of the companies  primarily  were  used  to
      receive cash deposits. The money was then  paid  back  to  individuals
      purporting to be  invoice  payments.  The  individuals  receiving  the
      payments were almost exclusively Indian nationals  who  later  applied
      for a Tier 1 (General) visa claiming to have undertaken some  form  of
      self-employed work for the company (normally as an IT consultant).

20.   Among the companies investigated by Operation Cudgegong was a  company
      called Iwin Technologies Limited. The investigation also  focussed  on
      an individual who was the director of an  accountancy  company  called
      AGS  Business  Consultancy  called  Anil  Kumar  Kasula  and   another
      individual who was the director of  an  OISC  registered  organisation
      called Incredible Immigration Services. The officer  gave  a  detailed
      explanation of how the fraud worked. Individuals who intended to apply
      for leave to remain sought to manufacture evidence to show they earned
      the level of income required for the visa by purporting  to  undertake
      self-employed work in the months preceding the visa  application.  The
      self-employed income was not genuine. The individuals paid  cash  into
      the company account directly or through a third party which  was  then
      paid back to the individual in order to give the  impression  that  it
      was earned income. Tax was typically paid on the false income.

21.   The officer outlined what was discovered about the  sole  director  of
      Iwin Technologies Ltd, Raghavendra Karanam.  After  investigating  his
      personal and business accounts it was discovered that Mr Karanam often
      received money into his personal account and then  transferred  it  to
      the Iwin Technologies business account before transferring  the  money
      back to the person as a purported invoice payment. Mr Karanam left the
      UK and did not return when other organisers of the fraud were arrested
      in October 2012. The officer says that 27 people who applied for  Tier
      1  (General)  visas  were  arrested  on  suspicion  of  conspiracy  to
      facilitate a breach of immigration law. Of those, 23 admitted that the
      self-employed income was falsified and that the payments were recycled
      back to them. They said that the  recycling  of  monies  was  arranged
      either by Mr Karanam or Mr Kasula. Some received cautions, their visas
      were revoked, and they made voluntary departures to India. Others were
      prosecuted and received sentences of 14-18 months.  The  investigation
      asked an approved forensic accountant to look at the accounts  of  the
      companies  concerned.  The  forensic  accountant  concluded  that  the
      companies  did  not  trade  genuinely.  The  accounts  were  used  for
      recycling monies for Tier 1 visas.

22.   In relation to this appellant the officer states:

           "Swapnil Diwakar SURADKAR 3/5/78 a national of India applied for
           a Tier 1 General visa on 5/11/10. This application stated he had
           earned a total of �50,996 in  the  qualifying  period  of  which
           �11,928 was from paid employment with Anthonydonaldevans Ltd and
           �39,068  (net)  from  self-employment.  At  the  time   of   the
           application SURADKAR was resident in Liverpool.


           The account of Iwin Technologies  shows  the  following  payment
           being made to SURADKAR.


                 29-Sep-2010 BP   S SUDARKAR CONSULTANT PAY   5,000.00


           This payment can be seen to  be  funded  by  a  number  of  cash
           deposits  made  into  Iwin  Technologies  account  in  Liverpool
           shortly before the payment is made.


           The accountant recorded in the application was PKG Plus although
           not investigated as part of Op  Cudgegong  this  accountant  was
           used on at least one other beneficiary I have come across in the
           course of the investigation."

23.   Although the respondent has  not  produced  copies  of  the  documents
      referred to in the statement the information provided by  the  officer
      from Operation Cudgegong is from a reliable source and  has  not  been
      challenged.

24.   In any event, the appellant  does  not  dispute  that  he  received  a
      payment of �5,000 from Iwin Technologies only a few  weeks  before  he
      made the application for leave to remain. The appellant says  that  he
      worked for a company called Anthony Donald Evans Ltd in Liverpool.  He
      had also become involved in a self-employed work  selling  information
      relating to people who  had  suffered  personal  injury  following  an
      accident who might be interested in pursuing  a  claim  (described  as
      "leads"). He says that one of his clients in Liverpool introduced  him
      to a person called "Raj" from London who was interested in  purchasing
      leads. The appellant says that once Raj  placed  the  order  over  the
      phone, he worked through the data to generate the  leads  that  fitted
      the criteria. After that, he travelled to Liverpool Street Station  in
      London where he met Raj to hand over the hard  copies  of  the  leads.
      When cross-examined the appellant said that he only spoke  to  Raj  on
      the phone. He did not have any postal or email contact details. He did
      not think this was out of the ordinary. He wanted to meet  his  client
      face to face. He took Raj on his word when he said that he  would  pay
      him for the data. He later received a payment from Iwin  Techonologies
      Ltd.

25.   The appellant included example "leads" in the bundle, which appear  to
      be a series of handwritten notes of the personal details of people who
      suffered injury following an accident. It is unclear how the appellant
      obtained this information. Other examples are typewritten. I note that
      most of the evidence relating to self-employed income included in  the
      appellant's bundle appears to relate to the  application  for  further
      leave to remain as a Tier 1 Migrant made in 2013 although a few of the
      leads appear to go back as far as 2010. I can see  no  copies  of  the
      invoices that were said to have been issued for work outlined  in  the
      schedule for 2010 or any bank statements showing  payments  for  self-
      employed work undertaken in 2010.

26.   In response to the statement made by the officer from the Home  Office
      Immigration Crime Team the appellant points out  that  the  respondent
      could only point to one payment of �5,000 from Iwin  Technologies.  If
      he was involved in  the  fraud  as  claimed,  one  might  expect  more
      payments from the company to generate the income required to meet  the
      requirements of the immigration rules. He also points out that he  has
      not be arrested or questioned in relation to the fraud. He  says  that
      it is reasonable to infer that there was insufficient evidence to show
      that he was  involved  in  recycling  funds.  He  was  interviewed  in
      relation to his work when he applied for further leave  to  remain  in
      2013 and the officer was satisfied that it was a genuine business.

27.   In relation to the second area of concern, the respondent  noted  that
      there was a large discrepancy  between  the  amount  of  self-employed
      income declared to the UK Border Agency for the purpose  of  the  visa
      application in 2010 and the amount of self-employed  income  initially
      declared to HMRC for the tax year  2010-2011.  The  appellant  accepts
      that he did not file a tax return for 2010-2011 on time. The appellant
      has not provided an explanation as to why he did not file a tax return
      by the deadline in January 2012 even though he  claimed  to  earn  the
      bulk of his income for that tax year through self-employed work.

28.   The appellant says that he filed his first tax return in  April  2012.
      This is born out by the evidence from HMRC produced by the respondent.
      A witness statement of an official from HMRC dated  06  February  2019
      summarises  the  information  held.  The  records  indicate  that  the
      appellant filed a tax return for the year 2010-2011 on 29 April  2012.
      The original figures supplied to HMRC were �10,362 for employed income
      and �8,669 for self-employed income. There does not  appear  to  be  a
      record of a return being filed for 2011-2012.

29.   The appellant's bundle  also  contains  copies  of  several  HMRC  tax
      calculations.

        i) 2010-2011 - The calculation shows the  amendments  made  by  the
           appellant in 2015 to declare self-employed  income  of  �39,680.
           This reflected all the self-employed income he claimed  to  earn
           in a relatively brief  three-month  period  shortly  before  the
           first application for leave to remain as a Tier 1 Migrant.


       ii) 2011-2012 -  The  calculation  shows  only  �5,479  of  employed
           income.

      iii)  2012-2013  -  The  calculation  is  consistent  with  the  HMRC
           statement in showing gross self-employed income of  �52,848.  No
           employed income is recorded. I note that the appellant  made  an
           application for further leave to remain as a Tier 1  Migrant  on
           05 April 2013. The qualifying period  for  the  application  for
           further leave to remain would have covered this tax year.

       iv) 2013-2014 - The calculation shows a significantly reduced income
           of  �10,157  declared  from  self-employment  in  the  tax  year
           following the grant of further leave to remain.

        v) 2014-2015 - The calculation shows that  the  appellant's  income
           from self-employment remained at a low level of �11,830.

       vi) 2015-2016 - The appellant's declared self-employed  income  rose
           sharply to �42,610. I note that the appellant applied for ILR as
           a Tier 1 Migrant on 15 March 2016. The qualifying period for the
           application was likely to cover most of this tax year.

      vii) 2016-2017 - The appellant's self-employed  income  dropped  once
           again to �19,640 in the following tax year.

30.   In response to the application for ILR on grounds  of  long  residence
      the appellant was asked to complete  a  questionnaire  about  his  tax
      affairs. He provided a detailed response. The figures he  provided  at
      paragraph 5 of the questionnaire are consistent with the HMRC figures.
      The appellant explained how he got into the business of selling  leads
      through friends in India. He registered as self-employed  on  25  June
      2010. He explained how he began to sell information to people  he  met
      through online forums  and  personal  networking.  He  said  that  the
      following year (2011-2012) he was involved in a lost  making  business
      called AMS Helpline Ltd, which is why his income for that year was  so
      low. At the time, he was unfamiliar with the tax system.  He  did  not
      realise that tax years ran from April to  April.  When  he  filed  his
      first tax return in April 2012, he says that he offset the losses from
      AMS Helpline during the 2011-2012  tax  year  from  his  self-employed
      earnings in 2010-2011, which was why the initial declaration of  self-
      employed income was so much  lower  than  the  figure  stated  in  the
      application for leave to remain.  When  he  realised  the  mistake  he
      contacted HMRC to amend the tax return in 2015 after he had saved  the
      money that he estimated he owed.

 31.  The  appellant  says  that  after  the  failure  of  AMS  Helpline  he
      restarted self-employed work selling data and  was  able  to  earn  an
      income of �52,848 in the next tax  year.  He  traded  under  the  name
      Sammsolutions and later also  under  the  name  Sharp  Communications.
      After he applied for further leave to remain as a Tier  1  Migrant  in
      2013 he was invited for an interview to test whether his earnings were
      genuine. He gave a detailed explanation of how  the  business  worked.
      The officer was satisfied that the business was likely to be  genuine.
      The appellant asserts that he made a mistake in his  tax  affairs  and
      was not dishonest.

32.   The burden of proof in on the respondent to  produce  cogent  evidence
      to show on the balance of probability that the appellant was dishonest
      in the earlier application for leave to remain. Dishonesty needs to be
      shown in order to discharge the burden of proving that  the  appellant
      made false  representations  for  the  purpose  of  paragraph  322(2).
      Dishonesty is also at the heart of the second allegation. A mistake in
      his  tax  affairs  which  was  not  dishonest  is  not  likely  to  be
      sufficiently  serious  to  justify  refusing  an   application   under
      paragraph 322(5).

33.   I begin by considering  whether  the  respondent  has  discharged  the
      initial evidential burden of proof to show that there is a  reasonable
      suspicion that the appellant was dishonest when he applied  for  leave
      to remain as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant in November 2010.

34.   The evidence from the investigating officer from  Operation  Cudgegong
      is not disputed. It comes from a reliable source. I have been given no
      reason to doubt what  the  officer  says  about  the  level  of  fraud
      uncovered by the investigation. The evidence is compelling. It  paints
      a picture of a systematic fraud conducted by the sole director of Iwin
      Technologies, Raghavendra Karanam, in co-ordination with  others.  The
      evidence is sufficiently strong to suggest that Mr Karanam did not run
      a genuine  business.  A  forensic  accountant  inspected  the  company
      accounts and was satisfied that Iwin Techonologies  was  a  front  for
      recycling funds for the purpose of manufacturing evidence  to  support
      Tier 1 applications. A number of people  were  arrested  and  admitted
      that they had recycled money in this way. Some were removed and others
      were successfully prosecuted.

35.   The appellant accepts that he received a payment of �5,000  from  Iwin
      Technologies on  29  September  2010.  This  is  consistent  with  the
      information provided in the  investigating  officer's  statement.  The
      respondent asserts that  this  shows  that  the  appellant  used  Iwin
      Technologies to recyle money to create false evidence of self-employed
      income.

36.   I have considered whether the appellant has been able  to  provide  an
      innocent explanation in response. I  am  not  satisfied  that  he  has
      provided a credible account to rebut the  allegation.  I  accept  that
      there is evidence in the bundle to suggest that, at least since  2012,
      the appellant is likely to have been earning  a  self-employed  income
      from selling data. In 2013 the interviewing officer was satisfied that
      the appellant was able to give detailed  knowledge  of  the  business.
      However, I note that the GCID notes relating to the  interview  stated
      that the officer had some concerns over  the  level  of  earnings  the
      appellant claimed to earn from self-employment, but at the time,  felt
      that they had "no solid evidence to act on suspicions" [pg.F11].

37.   When one steps back and looks at  the  evidence  as  a  whole,  in  my
      assessment, the following picture emerges. In 2010 the  appellant  was
      not earning enough from employed work to meet the income  requirements
      of the immigration rules for leave to remain as  a  Tier  1  (General)
      Migrant. As a result,  it  is  possible  that  the  appellant  had  an
      incentive to make up the shortcoming by falsely exaggerating the level
      of self-employed income. Although there is evidence to show  that  the
      appellant is likely to have been involved in the business  of  selling
      data, the pattern of income gives rise to a strong inference that  the
      level of his self-employed earnings has been exaggerated  in  each  of
      the three years that he applied for leave to remain. In between  those
      years, the level  of  self-employed  income  declared  to  HMRC  drops
      significantly. I have taken into account the appellant's evidence that
      he had to undergo a series of operations from late 2012 to early 2015,
      which he says explains the fluctuation in income,  but  it  remains  a
      strong coincidence that  the  highest  earning  years  coincided  with
      applications for leave to remain when a certain level  of  income  was
      required. Even after his period of  ill-health,  his  declared  income
      dropped sharply again in the tax year after he applied for  ILR  as  a
      Tier 1 Migrant (2016-2017).

38.   Other aspects of the chronology also lack credibility.  The  appellant
      claims that he began selling data in mid-2010 and has remained in  the
      same business, with varying levels of  income,  ever  since.  When  he
      applied for leave to remain in November  2010  the  appellant  claimed
      that he earned �39,068  from  self-employment.  He  produced  evidence
      claiming that he received ten payments from clients over a brief three-
      month period shortly before the application for leave to remain. I can
      see no evidence to suggest that the appellant continued with this work
      after September 2010. When the appellant amended the  tax  return  for
      2010-2011 he declared exactly the same amount of income as he  did  in
      the application for leave to remain even though the tax year ran until
      April 2011. On the appellant's own evidence, his self-employed  income
      came to an abrupt halt once he received the ten payments  outlined  in
      the schedule and he earned no further  self-employed  income  for  the
      remaining six months of that tax year. This picture is not  consistent
      with an ongoing business and is more  consistent  with  a  pattern  of
      manufactured evidence in the months  preceding  the  visa  application
      described by the officer from Operation Cudgegong.

39.   If the evidence relating to Operation Cudgegong  is  then  taken  into
      account, the reliability of the income  claimed  in  the  schedule  is
      further  undermined.  The  appellant  is  correct  to  say  that   the
      respondent has not produced evidence  to  show  that  the  other  nine
      payments were recycled to falsely create  the  impression  of  genuine
      income, but the evidence is damning in relation to  at  least  one  of
      those payments.

40.   The appellant's response lacked credibility. First, it  is  reasonable
      to infer that the person called Raj who the appellant claimed to  meet
      at Liverpool Street Station is more likely than not to be  Raghavendra
      Karanam. It is plausible that his first name  could  be  shortened  in
      that way. The appellant accepts that he received a payment  from  Iwin
      Technologies. Mr Karanam was the sole director  of  the  company.  The
      evidence shows that any payment was likely to be made by him.  Second,
      the appellant's claim to have sold Mr Karanam leads  as  part  of  his
      self-employed work is weak in light of  the  evidence  from  Operation
      Cudgegong, which strongly suggests that Mr Karanam was not  likely  to
      be running a genuine business and would have no reason  to  buy  leads
      from the appellant. The account  of  travelling  to  Liverpool  Street
      Station to hand over leads is implausible  when  the  documents  could
      easily be sent by post. Third, the evidence shows that it is far  more
      likely that Mr Karanam was in the business of receiving cash  payments
      from Tier 1 applicants, which he recycled back  as  purported  invoice
      payments.

41.   The respondent does not need to prove her case with any certainty.  It
      matters not if she can only prove that one and not all the payments in
      the schedule were false. It is sufficient to show on  the  balance  of
      probability that at least one of the payments was  not  likely  to  be
      genuine for the appellant to have made a false representations in  the
      application. However, the fact that at least  one  payment  was  false
      casts  doubt  on  the  whole  schedule  when  taken  with  the   other
      credibility issues outlined above.

42.   The fact that  the  appellant  was  not  arrested  and  questioned  is
      immaterial. The standard of proof for a criminal prosecution  is  much
      higher. A lower standard is applied for the purpose of  assessing  the
      immigration rules. The fact that the interviewing officer in 2013  was
      satisfied that he was likely to be earning an income selling  data  at
      that time does not mean that he earned the level of income he  claimed
      in 2010. Even then, the officer suspected that  the  level  of  income
      claimed in 2013 might have been exaggerated  but  did  not  feel  that
      there was enough evidence to refuse the application at the time.

43.   The second concern relating to the HMRC payments  forms  part  of  the
      overall picture. If this was the only issue, I might  have  given  the
      appellant the benefit of the doubt. His explanation is that he made  a
      mistake in his tax affairs and was not dishonest. However, when it  is
      put alongside the stronger evidence relating to  the  organised  fraud
      carried out by Iwin Technologies  to  assist  Tier  1  applicants  the
      appellant's explanation becomes less persuasive. Even if he had  begun
      to carry out some self-employed work selling data  in  2010,  when  he
      initially declared his self-employed income for  the  tax  year  2010-
      2011, he only declared �8,669.  Taken  with  his  employed  income  of
      �11,928 in the qualifying period preceding the application  for  leave
      to remain,  his  income  from  both  sources  was  not  likely  to  be
      sufficient to meet the income requirements  for  Tier  1.  Again,  the
      appellant was likely to have an incentive to exaggerate the  level  of
      self-employed income to satisfy the requirements but was  unlikely  to
      want to pay tax on money he did not earn.  I  find  that  it  is  more
      likely that the appellant declared his  real  level  of  self-employed
      income to HMRC in 2012 thereby belying his claim  to  have  earned  as
      much as �39,068. The fact that he was later  willing  to  pay  tax  on
      money he may not have earned in preparation for an application for ILR
      is a  matter  that  cannot  be  given  significant  weight  given  the
      importance of such an application to his future in the UK.

44.   I bear in mind that the respondent does not have  to  prove  her  case
      with certainty. Having weighed the evidence as a whole, I am satisfied
      that the respondent has discharged the legal burden of  proof.  It  is
      more likely than not that  the  appellant  was  dishonest  by  falsely
      inflating his self-employed income for the purpose of an earlier  Tier
      1  application.  The  respondent  was  justified   in   refusing   the
      application for leave to remain on  grounds  of  long  residence  with
      reference to paragraph 276B(ii) and (iii) as well as paragraphs 322(2)
      and 322(5) of the immigration rules. The appellant fails to  meet  the
      requirement of paragraph 276B for this reason  alone,  so  it  is  not
      necessary to determine whether he had 10 years lawful residence.

Article 8(1) - private life

45.   The appellant has lived in the UK for a period of  11  years  and  his
      wife for a period of nearly 10 years. It is likely  that  during  this
      time the appellant and his wife have developed private  life  ties  in
      the UK. I find that removal in consequence of the decision  is  likely
      to interfere with their private lives in a sufficiently grave  way  as
      to engage the operation of Article 8(1) of the European Convention.

Article 8(2) - proportionality

46.   Article 8 of the European Convention protects  the  right  to  private
      and family life. However, it is not  an  absolute  right  and  can  be
      interfered with by the state in certain circumstances. It is trite law
      that the state has a right  to  control  immigration  and  that  rules
      governing the entry and residence of people into the country  are  "in
      accordance  with  the  law"  for  the  purpose  of  Article   8.   Any
      interference with the right to private or family life must  be  for  a
      legitimate reason and should be reasonable and proportionate.

47.   Part 5A of the  NIAA  2002  applies  where  a  court  or  tribunal  is
      required to determine whether a decision made  under  the  Immigration
      Acts breaches a person's right to private or  family  life  and  as  a
      result is unlawful under the Human Rights Act 1998. In considering the
      'public interest question' a court or tribunal must have regard to the
      issues outlined in section 117B in non-deportation cases. The  'public
      interest question' means the question of whether interference  with  a
      person's right  to  respect  for  their  private  or  family  life  is
      justified under Article 8(2) of the European Convention.

48.   It is in the public  interest  to  maintain  an  effective  system  of
      immigration control. The appellant  and  his  wife  do  not  meet  the
      requirements of the immigration rules. The appellant does not meet the
      requirements  of  paragraph  276B  on  grounds  of  10  years   lawful
      residence. His wife has not been resident long enough to meet the long
      residence requirement. The appellants do not  meet  the  20-year  long
      residence requirement contained in paragraph 276ADE(1)(iii). It is not
      argued, nor arguable, that there are 'very significant  obstacles'  to
      the couple being able  to  integrate  in  India  for  the  purpose  of
      paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi). They were born and brought up  in  India  and
      continue to have linguistic, cultural and family  ties  there.  It  is
      understandable that they would prefer to remain in the UK,  where  the
      appellant has established a business selling data,  but  there  is  no
      evidence to suggest that they would face significant obstacles if they
      returned  to  their  country  of  origin.  The  requirements  of   the
      immigration rules and the statutory provisions are said to reflect the
      respondent's position as to where a fair balance  is  struck  for  the
      purpose of Article 8 of the European Convention.

49.   The appellant speaks English  and  can  support  himself  financially.
      Those are neutral factors. Over time, he has been able to develop  his
      business and has plans to develop it further. It is  likely  that  his
      ties to the UK have strengthened over time. However, the foundation of
      all that the appellant has achieved in the UK was based on an  initial
      deception. But for that deception, it is likely that he would not have
      qualified for leave to remain and would have been  expected  to  leave
      the UK many  years  ago.  The  general  grounds  for  refusal  reflect
      legitimate public policy considerations  in  cases  where  a  person's
      conduct means that it is undesirable for them to remain in the UK. The
      appellant might well have worked hard to establish himself, but  there
      are consequences arising from his conduct if he used deception  in  an
      initial application for leave to remain. The fact  that  he  has  been
      able to remain for many years before  the  dishonesty  was  discovered
      does not weaken the weight that must be given to the public  interest.
      The appellant simply gained an advantage that he was not likely to  be
      entitled to in the first place.

50.   The appellant does  not  meet  the  requirements  of  the  immigration
      rules. Additional weight must be given to the  public  interest  in  a
      case where a person has been dishonest in an application for leave  to
      remain.  The  evidence  does  not  disclose  any   other   exceptional
      circumstances that might justify a grant of leave to remain  on  human
      rights grounds. The  appellants  do  not  have  children.  No  serious
      medical or other compassionate circumstances  have  been  highlighted.
      The appellant's wife  expresses  concerns  about  returning  to  India
      because of their mixed religion  marriage,  but  this  issue  was  not
      relied upon in argument. Even if  she  has  some  concerns  about  the
      attitudes of her family, it would be possible for  the  appellants  to
      relocate to another area of India. They are both Indian nationals with
      qualifications that  would  assist  them  to  re-establish  themselves
      there. Having weighed all the relevant factors, I  conclude  that  the
      decision to refuse the human rights claim is proportionate.

51.   For the reasons given above, I conclude that  removal  in  consequence
      of the decision would not be unlawful under section  6  of  the  Human
      Rights Act 1998.

Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr J. Gajjar, instructed by Eldon Berkeley
Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr T. Lindsay, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer



                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    The first appellant ("the appellant") is the main applicant; his  wife
    is his dependent for the purpose of the decision that is the subject of
    this appeal.

2.    The appellant entered the UK on 25 January 2009 with  entry  clearance
    as a Tier 1  (Post-study  work)  Migrant,  which  was  valid  until  05
    November 2010. He was granted further leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  1
    (General) Migrant until 05 April 2013, and further leave  on  the  same
    basis until 11 November 2016. On 15 March 2016  the  appellant  applied
    for Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant. The
    respondent refused the application in a decision dated 27  April  2017.
    A subsequent Administrative Review upheld the decision on 08 June 2017.
    At this point the appellant's leave to remain, extended  by  virtue  of
    section 3C(2)(d) of the Immigration Act 1971, came to an  end.  At  the
    date of the Administrative Review decision the appellant had resided in
    the UK on a lawful basis for a period of eight years and  five  months.
    On 23 June 2017 the appellant made an out of time application for leave
    to remain on grounds of long residence.

3.    A few weeks later, on 27  July  2017,  he  filed  an  application  for
    judicial review seeking  to  challenge  the  respondent's  decision  to
    refuse to grant ILR as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant. The judicial  review
    claim settled by consent on 29 November 2017. The respondent agreed  to
    make a fresh decision in relation to the application for ILR as a  Tier
    1 (General) Migrant. In a further decision dated 04 December  2018  the
    respondent refused the application again.  The  appellant  applied  for
    Administrative Review of the decision.

4.    The appellant applied to vary the long  residence  application  on  28
    December  2018.  The  effect  of   the   application   was   that   the
    Administrative Review  was  treated  as  withdrawn  with  reference  to
    paragraph 34X(4) of the immigration rules. I am told that the applicant
    nevertheless applied to challenge the respondent's  decision  dated  04
    December 2018 and that an application for judicial review is pending.

5.    The respondent refused a human rights claim  in  the  context  of  the
    application for  leave  to  remain  on  grounds  of  10  years'  lawful
    residence on 14 February 2019. The decision  is  the  subject  of  this
    appeal. The respondent outlined the same public interest issues,  which
    formed the basis of the refusal  of  the  previous  applications  under
    paragraphs 322(2) and  322(5)  of  the  immigration  rules.  The  first
    allegation was that he obtained earlier leave to  remain  by  deception
    based  on  false  documents  provided  by   a   company   called   Iwin
    Technologies, which was said to have been involved in  providing  false
    documents  for  immigration  applications.  The  second  allegation  of
    deception related to  discrepancies  in  the  amount  of  self-employed
    income declared to the UKVI for the purpose of an  earlier  application
    for leave to remain compared with the amount  of  self-employed  income
    declared to HMRC  during  the  same  tax  period.  In  any  event,  the
    respondent was not satisfied that the appellant met the requirement for
    10 years' lawful residence because his leave to remain  expired  on  08
    June 2017.

6.    First-tier Tribunal Judge A.K. Hussain  ("the  judge")  dismissed  the
    appeal in a decision promulgated on 07 August 2019. The judge explained
    why the appellant did not meet the requirement  for  10  years'  lawful
    residence with reference to the chronology. In light of  that  finding,
    he said that he did not need to make detailed findings relating to  the
    general grounds for refusal under  paragraphs  322(2)  and  322(5).  He
    concluded  that  the  appellants  did  not  meet  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 276ADE(1)(iii) (20 years' long residence) and could not  show
    that there were 'very significant obstacles' to  their  integration  if
    they returned to India for the purpose of paragraph  276ADE(1)(vi).  He
    went on to conduct a balancing exercise under Article 8.  Having  found
    that the appellants did not meet the requirements  of  the  immigration
    rules, he concluded that there were no  compelling  circumstances  that
    might outweigh the public interest in maintaining an  effective  system
    of immigration control and dismissed the appeal.

7.    At the hearing, Mr Gajjar said that he was not going to  rely  on  the
    third ground of appeal. He distilled his case into a single  point.  He
    argued that the judge erred in failing to make any findings relating to
    the general grounds for refusal under paragraphs 322(2) and 322(5).  He
    accepted that this would  not  make  any  material  difference  to  the
    outcome of the appeal in so far as it related to  the  application  for
    leave to remain under paragraph 276B (10 years' lawful  residence)  but
    argued that it was material to  a  proper  assessment  of  the  overall
    balancing exercise under Article 8.

8.    Mr Lindsay argued that the outcome of  the  balancing  exercise  would
    have  been  the  same  regardless  of  any  findings  relating  to  the
    allegations of deception. Any error was not material.

Decision and reasons

9.    It was not necessary for the judge to make findings of  fact  relating
    to the allegations of deception for  the  purpose  of  determining  the
    appeal in so far as it related to paragraph  276B  of  the  immigration
    rules when the appellant fell short of meeting the core requirement for
    10 years' lawful  residence.  No  challenge  has  been  made  to  those
    findings or to the findings  relating  to  paragraph  276ADE(1).  Those
    findings shall stand.

10.   However, the allegations  of  deception  were  relevant  to  a  proper
    assessment of what weight should be placed on the  public  interest  in
    the overall balancing exercise  under  Article  8.  If  the  judge  had
    decided that the allegations were made out, it  would  only  have  lent
    greater weight to the  public  interest  in  maintaining  an  effective
    system of immigration control. But if the appellant was  successful  in
    rebutting the allegations it may have been relevant  to  the  issue  of
    what weight should be placed on his  individual  circumstances  in  the
    balancing exercise. The allegations of deception were the only  reasons
    given for refusing  the  earlier  application  for  ILR  as  a  Tier  1
    (General) Migrant. Although it does not necessarily  follow  that,  but
    for the allegation of deception, the appellant would have been  granted
    ILR, it would at least cast doubt on the reasons given for refusing the
    earlier applications for settlement. The fact that he might have missed
    the  opportunity  for  settlement  based  on  allegations   that   were
    subsequently not made  out  would  be  a  relevant  consideration  when
    assessing whether it would be proportionate to require  the  appellants
    to leave the UK.

11.   For these reasons, I conclude that the First-tier Tribunal  failed  to
    make findings on a relevant  matter  that  was  material  to  a  proper
    determination of the appeal. This failure amounts to an error of law.

12.   It is appropriate  to  remake  the  decision  in  the  Upper  Tribunal
    because some of the findings have been preserved. Given the  complexity
    of some of the issues involved in  remaking  it  was  agreed  that  the
    parties needed more time to prepare. The matter will be  listed  for  a
    resumed hearing.

13.   The judge's findings relating to paragraphs 276B and 276ADE(1) of  the
    immigration rules shall  stand.  The  scope  of  the  next  hearing  is
    confined to (i) findings of fact relating to the  general  grounds  for
    refusal; and (ii) how those findings impact  on  an  overall  balancing
    exercise under Article 8.

DIRECTIONS

14.   The parties are granted permission to produce  up  to  date  evidence,
    which must be filed at least seven days before the next hearing.

15.   It is anticipated that the first appellant will give evidence  at  the
    resumed hearing. If he requires the assistance of  an  interpreter,  he
    should notify the Upper Tribunal  within  14  days  of  the  date  this
    decision is sent so that arrangements  can  be  made  for  the  resumed
    hearing.


DECISION

The First-tier Tribunal decision involved the making of an error on a  point
of law

The decision will be remade at a resumed hearing in the Upper Tribunal
