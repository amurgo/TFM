For the Appellant:     Mrs Johnrose, Broudie Jackson & Canter
For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of the Islamic Republic of  Iran,  born  in
    1992. He appeals with permission against the decision of the First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Mark Davies) to dismiss his protection appeal[1].


 2. The substance of the Appellant's claim is that he  has  a  well-founded
    fear of persecution in Iran for reasons of his ethnicity (Kurdish)  and
    religious belief (Zoroastrian).


 3. By her decision dated the 19th October 2018 the Respondent had rejected
    the account.  The Secretary of State's  starting  point  was  that  the
    Appellant had already claimed, and  been  refused,  protection  on  the
    basis that he was a convert to Zoroastrianism.   His  appeal  had  come
    before the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Ransley)  in  2016  and  she  had
    dismissed the appeal for want of  evidence.   Although  the  Respondent
    accepted  that  the  Appellant  had  produced   further   evidence   of
    Zoroastrian devotion sufficient to found a 'fresh  claim'  for  asylum,
    she considered that this evidence fell short  of  establishing  a  real
    risk of persecution.   It was accepted  that  the  Appellant  had  been
    attending Zoroastrian worship and  study  meetings,  and  that  he  had
    demonstrated an interest in the faith, but in the Secretary of  State's
    view this was nothing more than a "calculated attempt to  obtain  leave
    to remain in the United Kingdom".

 4. That then, was the  substance  of  the  appeal  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal. There was no dispute that the Appellant had  spent  the  past
    two years engaged in Zoroastrian worship and activities, but  the  task
    for the Tribunal was to determine whether this  was  in  pursuit  of  a
    genuinely held faith, or whether it was simply a cynical ploy.

 5. The  Appellant  attended  the  First-tier  Tribunal  hearing  and  gave
    evidence. He called a further three witnesses in his  support.  Two  of
    these witnesses knew him personally and could attest  to  the  kind  of
    conversations that they had with him, and  their  own  observations  of
    him. As such they were in effect Dorodian witnesses.  It had  been  the
    evidence of  these  witnesses  which  -  inter  alia  -  had  been  the
    foundation of the Appellant's 'fresh claim'. It is  therefore  somewhat
    surprising that their evidence receives  so  little  attention  in  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

 6. The findings on the evidence of one of these witnesses consists of this
    finding at paragraph 112: "he  has  had  little  involvement  with  the
    Appellant and seems to know nothing about the  Appellant's  Zoroastrian
    activity". Mrs Johnrose made strong objection to this  conclusion.  She
    pointed to the evidence of this witness that he had known the Appellant
    for over two years, had met him at numerous meetings and  had  observed
    him performing Zoroastrian rites which he had described  in  detail  in
    his live evidence.   She submitted that the failure  of  the  Judge  to
    engage with this material evidence was a clear error of law.

 7. As to the second witness (described by the First-tier Tribunal  as  the
    third) Mrs Johnrose submitted that the findings were similarly  lacking
    in anxious scrutiny, and were further flawed for error of  fact.   When
    the Judge writes at his paragraph 113:

         "He thought the Appellant had gone through an  initiation  ceremony
         in 2016 when in fact this was in 2017. The witness gave very  vague
         evidence and I concluded towards the end of his testimony  that  he
         was being evasive"

    He was, in Mrs Johnrose's submission, simply wrong as a matter of fact.
     There was no discrepancy  in  respect  of  the  dates:  in  fact  that
    Appellant had undergone two ceremonies, one in 2016 and  one  in  2017.
    The  witness  had  stated  that  he  himself  had  been  a   practising
    Zoroastrian for over ten years and that he had known the Appellant  for
    well over a year. He was personally "convinced" that the Appellant  was
    genuine in his faith and belief because he had seen how the Appellant's
    world view and character had  changed  in  that  time.   He  had  given
    examples. None of that is reflected in the scant reasoning at paragraph
    113.

 8. As Mr McVeety rightly submitted, Judges are under no obligation  to  go
    through each and every line of a witness' testimony and  make  findings
    on it. They are however obliged to explain to the losing party why they
    have lost. The Appellant before me submits that he is quite  unable  to
    understand why the  personal  observations  of  his  character  by  two
    separate witnesses are simply dismissed on the  basis  that  they  are.
    I accept that the decision  is  flawed  for  a  failure  to  take  this
    material evidence into account and to give  adequate  reasons  for  the
    Judge's conclusions. The evidence of these witnesses was at the  centre
    of the appeal and yet the only particular mentioned in the reasoning is
    wrong in fact. I accept that the evidence of these witnesses  does  not
    appear to have been analysed with anxious scrutiny.

 9. The remainder of the grounds are not  contested  by  the  Secretary  of
    State. It was not in issue that the Appellant  had  posted  Zoroastrian
    material  on  Facebook.  This  evidence  is  dealt  with  in  a  wholly
    inadequate way by the Tribunal, which simply found [at its  ï¿½115]  that
    this was an attempt to "bolster a fabricated claim".  The Secretary  of
    State rightly accepts that this was an incomplete risk  assessment  and
    that in fact that Judge was obliged to  consider  whether  those  posts
    were capable of placing the Appellant at risk. Similarly the fact  that
    the Appellant was Kurdish is dismissed as irrelevant at  paragraph  121
    of the decision: the Secretary of State accepts that in  light  of  the
    country guidance in HB (Kurds) Iran CG [2018] UKUT 00430 (IAC) this was
    wrong as a matter of fact. The task of  the  Judge  was,  at  the  very
    minimum, to assess whether a Kurd returned to Iran with  a  history  of
    posting  Zoroastrian  material  on  Facebook  would  be  of  sufficient
    interest  to  the  authorities  to  merit  transfer  to  'second  line'
    questioning, where there could arise a real risk of ill-treatment:  SSH
    and HR  (illegal exit: failed asylum seeker) Iran CG [2016]  UKUT  308.
    This important part  of  the  risk  assessment  was  missing  from  the
    decision.


10. In light of the fact that the remaking will involve live evidence  from
    at least three witnesses, and the making of extensive findings of fact,
    I agree with the parties  that  the  most  appropriate  forum  for  its
    disposal would be the First-tier Tribunal.


      Decisions

11. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains  material  errors
    of law and it is set aside.


12. The decision in the appeal is to be remade in the First-tier  Tribunal,
    by a Judge other than Judge Mark Davies, at a date to be notified.


13. Having regard to the fact that this is a protection claim  I  make  the
    following direction for anonymity, pursuant to Rule 14 of the  Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  and  the  Presidential  Guidance
    Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity Orders.


        "Unless and until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his
        family.  This direction applies both to the Appellants and  to  the
        Respondent.  Failure to comply with this direction  could  lead  to
        contempt of court proceedings".










                                                  Upper Tribunal Judge Bruce
                                                            19th November
                                    2019
                           -----------------------
[1] The decision of Judge Davies was promulgated on the 8th January 2019.
Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was granted on the 5th February
2019 and on the 31st May 2019 the matter came before Judge McClure, sitting
as a Deputy Judge of the Upper Tribunal. Judge McClure found the decision
of Judge Davies to be flawed for material error of law, setting it aside
and ordering that the appeal be remitted for disposal in the First-tier
Tribunal. On the 28th August 2019 Upper Tribunal Judge Gill issued a Notice
proposing to set the decision of Judge McClure aside for procedural
irregularity. Neither party objected and so the matter has come before me.
The procedural irregularity identified by Judge Gill was that Judge McClure
had proceeded on the basis that the grant of permission to the Upper
Tribunal had been on limited terms: in fact this was not so, and the
Appellant had been granted permission to argue his case on all grounds.
