Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr A Malik, instructed by Queens Park Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. These are the approved record of the decision and  reasons  which  were
    given orally at the end of the hearing on 14th May 2021.

 2. Both representatives and I attended the hearing via Skype  and  hearing
    was open for public access at Field House.  The parties did not  object
    to attending via Skype and I was  satisfied  that  the  representatives
    were able to participate in the hearing.

 3. This is the remaking of the decision in the appellant's appeal, on  the
    basis of the  right  to  respect  for  her  family  life,  against  the
    respondent's refusal on 13th July 2016 of  her  application  for  entry
    clearance for settlement as the then-minor dependent of her  mother,  a
    naturalised  British  citizen,  Mrs  Emily  Mangulabnan.  The   further
    background to this appeal is set out in my decision following a hearing
    on 10th December 2020 in this Tribunal to decide whether the First-tier
    Tribunal had erred in law in  rejecting  the  appellant's  appeal.   My
    error-of-law decision is annexed to this remaking decision.

 4. In a decision promulgated  on  4th  September  2019,  Judge  Hosie  had
    rejected the appellant's appeal in the context of paragraphs  297(i)(e)
    and (f) of the Immigration Rules.  I determined that there was no error
    in relation to paragraph 297(i)(f) and preserved the FtT's findings and
    conclusion on that issue, while finding there to be an error of law and
    setting aside the FtT's findings in relation  to  paragraph  297(i)(e).
    It is the dispute over paragraph  297(i)(e)  that  is  the  subject  of
    remaking.

The issues in this appeal

 5. Noting the limited scope of remaking, the issues are:

      1. Whether the  sponsor  had  sole  parental  responsibility  for  the
         appellant,  for  the  purposes  of  paragraph  297(i)(e)   of   the
         Immigration Rules. The representatives agreed that were I  to  find
         that the appellant met the requirement of 297(i)(e) (and  the  only
         issue  in   this   regard   was   the   sponsor's   sole   parental
         responsibility), this would be  determinative  of  the  appellant's
         human rights appeal.

      2. Outside the Immigration Rules, I would also need  to  consider  the
         well-known authority of Razgar v SSHD [2004] UKHL 27. The questions
         were:

             1. Whether the appellant enjoys a family life with the sponsor?

             2.  Whether  the  refusal  of  entry   clearance   would   have
                consequences of such     gravity as  potentially  to  engage
                the operation of article 8?

             3. Whether such interference was in accordance with the law?

             4. Whether such interference  was  necessary  in  a  democratic
                society in the interests of national security, public safety
                or  the  economic  well-being  of  the  country,   for   the
                prevention of disorder  or  crime,  for  the  protection  of
                health or morals, or for the protection of  the  rights  and
                freedoms of others?

             5. If so, is such interference proportionate to the  legitimate
                public end sought to be achieved?

      3. In considering the appellant's right to a family life, it was  also
         necessary for me to consider her best interests, as she was a minor
         at the date of her application.

The gist of the respondent's refusal

 6. The core points taken against the appellant were that in its view,  the
    sponsor had shared parental responsibility for the appellant  with  the
    appellant's grandparents and her aunt, to whom the appellant turned for
    guidance.

The Hearing

Document and submissions

 7. The appellant provided  a  bundle  of  documents,  which  included  her
    witness statement and that of the sponsor.  The bundle was  adduced  at
    short notice, on the morning of the  hearing,  in  breach  of  Tribunal
    directions.  While I make no criticism of Mr Malik, I confirmed to  him
    that disclosure at such short notice, without explanation, was  not  to
    be encouraged and I repeat this here for the benefit of the appellant's
    solicitors.   Mr Walker also drew my attention to the decision of First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Mill promulgated on 3rd January 2019, in respect of
    the appellant's  brother,  John  Kennedy  Mangulabnan  (appeal  number:
    HU/06378/2018), where Judge Mill had found that the  sponsor  had  sole
    parental  responsibility  for  the  appellant's  brother,   where   the
    arrangements for care appeared to be identical to the appellant.

 8. On behalf of  the  respondent,  Mr  Walker  referred  to  Judge  Mill's
    decision, which had considered and applied, at �12 and �14,  the  well-
    known authority of TD ("Sole Responsibility) Yemen [2006] UKAIT  00049.
    At �15, Judge Mill had found the sponsor to be a credible witness.   On
    the basis of that finding and the witness statement of the  sponsor  in
    the bundle before me, which  was  unchallenged,  Mr  Walker  said  that
    logically, there could be no  conclusion  other  than  the  appellant's
    appeal must succeed, on the same basis that the  appellant's  brother's
    appeal had succeeded.  The only reason  he  could  not  make  a  formal
    concession was that the impugned decision had been taken by  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer and he was instructed by the Secretary of  State  for
    the Home Department.  He re-emphasised that there was  no  evidence  in
    respect of the appellant that should lead me to a conclusion  different
    to Judge Mill.

 9. On behalf of the appellant, Mr Malik indicated that he had  no  further
    submissions to make and I agreed that it was unnecessary for him to  do
    so.

Findings

10. In light of Mr Walker's submissions, for the same  reasons  that  Judge
    Mill had concluded that the appellant's brother met the requirements of
    paragraph  297(i)(e),   namely  that  the  sponsor  had  sole  parental
    responsibility for John Kennedy Mangulabnan, I similarly conclude  that
    the  same  sponsor,   Mrs   Emily   Mangulabnan   has   sole   parental
    responsibility for the appellant and there are no other requirements of
    that paragraph that  have  not  been  met.   The  appellant  meets  the
    requirements of paragraph 297(i)(e) and that is  determinative  of  her
    article 8 ECHR appeal.



Decision

11. The  appellant's  appeal  on  human  rights  grounds  is  upheld.   The
    respondent's decision to refuse the appellant entry clearance  breaches
    the appellant's article 8 rights and is not upheld.

Solicitors

Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. These are the approved record of the decision and  reasons  which  were
    given orally at the end of the hearing on 10th December 2020.

 2. Both representatives attended the hearing via Skype and I attended  the
    hearing in-person at Field House.  The parties did not  object  to  the
    hearing being via Skype and I was satisfied  that  the  representatives
    were able to participate in the hearing.

 3. This is an appeal by the appellant,  a  national  of  the  Philippines,
    against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Hosie  (the  'Judge')
    promulgated  on  4th  September  2018,  by  which  she  dismissed   the
    appellant's appeal against the respondent's refusal of entry  clearance
    to settle with her mother, Mrs Emily  Mangulabnan  (the  'sponsor'),  a
    naturalised British citizen.  At  the  time  of  her  application,  the
    appellant was a minor (she was born on 4th June  1998  and  applied  on
    31st May 2016, a few days before her 18th birthday).  The basis of the
    application, and the later issue before the Judge, was the  appellant's
    assertion that she met the criteria of paragraphs 297(i)(e) and (f)  of
    the Immigration Rules, as she sought to  join  her  mother,  a  British
    national, who had sole parental responsibility for her upbringing;  and
    in the alternative, that there were serious and  compelling  family  or
    other considerations which made exclusion of the appellant from the  UK
    undesirable.

 4. Following the appellant's application, the respondent  interviewed  the
    appellant's grandmother, with whom the appellant resided, on 14th  July
    2016.  The  grandmother  was  asked  about  the  arrangements  for  the
    appellant's care and living arrangements.  In light of that  interview,
    the respondent rejected the appellant's application in a decision dated
    13th July 2016.  The  respondent  noted  that  the  sponsor  had  lived
    overseas  for  at  least  the  last  12  years,  the  majority  of  the
    appellant's childhood and all of the appellant's formative years.   The
    appellant had lived with her father until 2012,  when  her  grandmother
    and  aunt  took  responsibility  for  her  care  and  upbringing.   The
    respondent regarded the arrangements for the appellant's  current  home
    as  satisfactory,  as  the  property  had  a  TV  and  other  household
    amenities, electricity and running water.  The appellant's  grandmother
    confirmed that  she  and  the  appellant's  aunt  made  the  day-to-day
    decisions in the appellant's  life,  and  this  extended  to  attending
    school meetings and they were the people to whom the  appellant  turned
    for guidance.  Whilst the respondent noted that the  sponsor  had  sent
    money transfers during 2015 and 2016 and the respondent also considered
    a small  number  of  photographs,  the  frequency  of  remittances  was
    limited, given the period of time in which the  sponsor  and  appellant
    had remained in contact. The respondent concluded that the sponsor  did
    not have sole  parental  responsibility  since  2012,  nor  were  there
    serious and compelling family or other considerations.

 5. The appellant appealed against that decision, referring  to  the  well-
    known authority of  TD  (paragraph  297(i)(e):  "sole  responsibility")
    Yemen [2006] UKAIT 00049.  The  appellant  had  been  without  parental
    supervision of her father since 2012, when the appellant's  father  had
    returned the appellant and her brother to the sponsor's  care,  because
    of his alcoholism.

 6. The respondent maintained her decision in an  entry  clearance  manager
    review dated 25th November 2016, having reviewed an interim Philippines
    court order dated 2008, which granted  the  sponsor  temporary  custody
    from 20th May to 5th June 2008, but then ordered the sponsor to  return
    to her father on 5th June 2008.   The  respondent  concluded  that  the
    sponsor appeared only to have custody of the appellant when the sponsor
    visited  the  Philippines.   Taking  into  account  all  of  the  other
    circumstances, including living arrangements and the delay between  the
    sponsor being granted permanent residence in the UK in  2011  and  only
    making the  application  on  behalf  of  the  appellant  in  2016,  the
    respondent concluded  the  appellant  did  not  meet  the  criteria  of
    paragraph 297 of the Immigration Rules.

The Judge's decision

 7. The Judge  heard  evidence  from  the  sponsor,  and  her  husband,  Mr
    Delacruz, the appellant's  stepfather.   She  found  that  the  sponsor
    maintained regular contact with the appellant, visiting the Philippines
    approximately once a year for holidays.  At �46, the  Judge  considered
    the interim Philippines court  order  granting  temporary  transfer  of
    custody in 2008. The Judge noted that the  evidence  was  in  photocopy
    form only and that no  explanation  of  been  offered  as  to  why  the
    original document was not provided.  She placed limited weight on  that
    document, on the basis that it was a photocopy only.

 8. At �50, the Judge noted that the money remittances  that  were  limited
    and chat messages between the appellant and sponsor had  not  all  been
    translated.  There were no school records or certificates. The  sponsor
    had been living separately from the  appellant  since  2002,  when  the
    sponsor first went to work in Hong Kong and then in the UK  from  2004.
    The  Judge   noted   the   limited   documentary   evidence   regarding
    communications with the appellant's school or  concerning  her  medical
    care (�51).  At �52, the Judge noted that the appellant's current legal
    guardian was her grandmother and, in the circumstances, it was unlikely
    that either the sponsor or the appellant's estranged  father  had  sole
    responsibility for the appellant. The  judge  noted  at  �53  that  the
    appellant's grandmother had said in interview that she was in charge of
    day-to-day matters in relation to the appellant.   Whilst  the  sponsor
    may have significant input, that did not  necessarily  presuppose  that
    she had sole parental responsibility for her.  At �56, the Judge  noted
    that since leaving school, the appellant was not  working  and  was  no
    explanation for why she was not.

 9. In relation to paragraph 297(i)(f) (serious and  compelling  family  or
    other considerations), the Judge analysed the domestic circumstances at
    �57 to 58  and  did  not  accept  that  there  were  such  serious  and
    compelling circumstances. Moreover, in a freestanding  article  8  ECHR
    analysis, at �64, the Judge did not accept that,  to  the  extent  that
    family life existed between the sponsor and the appellant, the  refusal
    of entry clearance would be of sufficient gravity to engage article  8,
    because refusal merely maintain the 'status quo.'  Notwithstanding  the
    appellant's best interests as a minor under section 55 of the  Borders,
    Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009, the  appellant's  best  interests
    were to remain in the culture she knew; supported  by  the  people  she
    knew who and who had brought her up.  The Judge concluded that  refusal
    of entry clearance was proportionate.

10. Having considered the evidence as  a  whole,  the  Judge  rejected  the
    appellant's appeal.

The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

11. The appellant lodged grounds of appeal, which were  initially  rejected
    by both the First- tier Tribunal and Upper Tribunal,  but  that  latter
    refusal was then the subject of a  successful  'Cart'  judicial  review
    application.  The Upper Tribunal's  decision  refusing  permission  was
    quashed by an order of the Honourable Mr Justice Walker  and  following
    that order, permission was granted by Vice President Ockelton.

12. The grounds for appeal are essentially as follows:

      1. Ground (1) - at �46, the Judge had erred in applying limited weight
         to copy of  the  interim  court  order  merely  because  it  was  a
         photocopy.  The issue of its provenance or  reliability  had  never
         been raised by the respondent in her refusal decision and to  raise
         it in the decision was procedurally unfair.   Moreover,  the  Judge
         had ignored other documents in the appellant's bundle  before  her,
         from school, church and community officials.

      2. Ground (2) - the Judge had failed to explain  why,  notwithstanding
         that she  accepted  that  the  sponsor  and  grandmother  were  the
         appellant's main contacts in the case of  emergency,  she  was  not
         satisfied the sponsor had sole responsibility for the appellant.

      3. Ground (3) - the Judge had failed to apply the authority of TD,  as
         it was perfectly possible for the appellant's grandmother  to  have
         day-to-day caring responsibilities whilst the appellant, while  the
         sponsor retained  sole  parental  responsibility.   The  Judge  had
         impermissibly  considered  why  the  appellant  was  not  currently
         working when she was a child at the date of her application.

      4. Ground (4) - the Judge had failed to consider  that  sole  parental
         responsibility did not need to be  the  whole  of  the  appellant's
         life, provided that it existed at the date of the application.

13. In directions made on 7th September 2020, Upper Tribunal Judge  Plimmer
    also raised the issue that the appellant has a younger brother, born in
    1999 who applied for entry clearance to  join  the  sponsor  and  in  a
    decision promulgated on 3rd January  2019,  after  a  hearing  on  19th
    December 2018, a Judge of  the  first-tier  Tribunal,  Judge  Mill  had
    allowed the brother's appeal, accepting the sponsor was a credible  and
    reliable witness  and  concluding  that  she  exercised  sole  parental
    responsibility for the sibling. The respondent had  not  appealed  that
    decision.

The hearing before me

14. I discussed with the representatives the scope of  the  issues  and  in
    particular the issue identified by Judge Plimmer of  the  relevance  of
    the subsequent decision in relation to the appellant's younger brother.
     I drew the parties' attention to the Court of Appeal  decision  of  AL
    (Albania) v SSHD [2019] EWCA Civ 950, which had considered the  reverse
    situation, namely where there had been a positive initial decision  and
    a subsequent decision in relation to a connected family member, and how
    the principle of the well-known case of Devaseelan v SSHD [2002]  UKIAT
    00702 might apply.  However, in this case the negative decision was  in
    fact that of the appellant, which was the  first  decision.   Mr  Malik
    confirmed to me that he only  wished  to  refer  to  and  rely  on  the
    sibling's decision in the event of any remaking, if I were to find that
    the Judge had erred in law.

15. I therefore considered the remainder of the grounds.  In respect of the
    parties I was provided lengthy submissions in  writing  and  additional
    brief oral submissions by the representatives on the day.  I  summarise
    these briefly.

The respondent's submissions

16. In written submissions, the respondent submitted that the relevance  of
    the interim court document was limited (it related to a period in 2008,
    many years prior to the period from 2012 when the  sponsor  claimed  to
    have sole parental responsibility). The sponsor had been challenged  in
    the  hearing  before  the  Judge  as  to  why  she  had  only  produced
    photocopies and the burden was on her to prove the  existence  of  sole
    parental responsibility.  The Judge had  clearly  considered  that  the
    other documents relating to the school principal, church  minister  and
    chief community officer which, as I explored with the  representatives,
    had been referred to by the Judge at  �14,  but  nevertheless  did  not
    support the contention of sole parental responsibility and  essentially
    were entirely consistent with responsibility  shared  between  sponsor,
    appellant's aunt and grandmother.

17. Next, the Judge had, in the context of the relevant  authority  of  TD,
    made all of the relevant findings.  The Judge had  clearly  taken  into
    account the fact that the appellant's  father  had  not  been  actively
    involved in the appellant's life at �52 but had nevertheless gone on to
    consider financial support; annual visits; the appellant's age; and the
    lack of a  clear  dividing  line  between  older  childhood  and  early
    adulthood.  All of those were permissible considerations for the  Judge
    to have considered.

18. Crucially, the Judge had been aware of the distinction between the day-
    to-day care and responsibilities and making the important decisions  in
    the appellant's life and at �54, the Judge  had  expressly  noted  that
    there was an absence of evidence on this point.  In  the  circumstances
    both the grounds  and  the  further  submissions  were  an  attempt  to
    relitigate the appeal.

19. In the oral submissions, Ms Cunha argued that to the  extent  that  the
    Judge had applied limited weight to the court document, for a different
    reason, i.e. because of its provenance, to the respondent's reason  for
    applying limited weight to it in her refusal decision, because  it  was
    for a temporary period, years before,  the result was the same - it did
    not assist the  appellant.   The  court  order  merely  demonstrated  a
    temporary transfer of custody many years  before  the  application  for
    entry clearance and therefore was only  ever  likely  to  have  limited
    weight attached to it.  Put another way, even if it was said  that  the
    provenance should not have been  challenged,  it  would  have  made  no
    material difference to the Judge's decision.  It was also inaccurate to
    say that the respondent had never challenged sole responsibility, as Mr
    Malik appeared to suggest,  and that  was  clearly  an  inference  that
    could be drawn from the line of questioning in the hearing  before  the
    Judge.

20. The Judge had given detailed reasons at ��39, 40, 47 and 52 to 56,  for
    her conclusions and whilst Ms Cunha accepted that some of  the  wording
    in the decision could,  if  taken  in  isolation  be  misconstrued,  in
    particular the suggestion  that  day-to-day  care  by  the  grandmother
    therefore made  it  unlikely  that  either  would  have  sole  parental
    responsibility, (�52), this had to be read in the wider context and  in
    particular  the  findings  at  �53.   The  Judge  had  made  clear  and
    permissible findings and the challenge was no more than a  disagreement
    with those findings.

The appellant's submissions

21. In terms of the appellant's challenge, once again I only summarise  the
    lengthy written submissions, but the crucial point is that first, there
    had been limited consideration of the extensive  evidence  provided  to
    the Judge.  The Judge had failed to apply the authority of  TD  and  it
    was not clear whether the observations made  about  accommodation  were
    relevant to the issue of sole parental responsibility; or  serious  and
    compelling  family  or  other  considerations,  at  ��   47   and   49.
    Accommodation was not relevant to parental responsibility.

22. Moreover, the Judge had accepted the sponsor's regular  travel  to  the
    Philippines and regular contact and  in  those  circumstances,  it  was
    therefore inexplicable why there had been a finding that there was  not
    sole parental responsibility.

23. Also, critically,  there  was  no  need  for  the  sponsor's  care  and
    responsibility for the appellant to have been  for  the  whole  of  the
    appellant's life, which was suggested in the reasoning at  �45.  Whilst
    there  may  have  been  references  to  limited  evidence  of   school,
    accommodation and medical arrangements,  there  was  nevertheless  some
    evidence, which had been provided  in  the  context  of  the  sponsor's
    personal  statement  where   she   claimed   to   have   assumed   sole
    responsibility for these aspects of the appellant's life.

24. In the circumstances, there had been a failure to engage with, and draw
    the distinction between day-to-day care  and  parental  responsibility.
    This distinction had been emphasised at ��49 and 52(vii) to (ix) of TD,
    which the Judge had failed to apply.  For example, the finding  at  �53
    that the  grandmother  had  provided  day-to-day  support  ignored  the
    separate issue of  overall  parental  responsibility  and  the  Judge's
    reference at �54 to the grandmother's heavy  influence  over  practical
    day-to-day upbringing did not amount to the Judge properly  considering
    who took the important decisions in the appellant's life.  The  Judge's
    reference at the end of �54 to the lack of contact and support for  the
    "whole 16 years" of the appellant's life was also not  consistent  with
    the proposition, at �28 of Nmaju v Entry Clearance Officer [2001]  INLR
    26, that sole parental responsibility did not need to have existed  for
    the whole of a dependent child's life.

Discussion and conclusions

25. I draw the distinction on the one hand between  297(i)(e)  on  the  one
    hand and 297(i)(f), the first of course dealing with  the  question  of
    sole parental responsibility and the second dealing  with  serious  and
    compelling family or other considerations.

26. The only real challenge to 297(i)(f), is said by Mr Malik to be a  lack
    of clarity by the Judge  in  her  findings,  specifically  whether  the
    findings relating to accommodation in the  Philippines  are  linked  to
    this issue,  or  the  issue  of  sole  parental  responsibility.  I  am
    satisfied the findings are sufficiently clear and when read in context,
    clearly  relate   to   serious   and   compelling   family   or   other
    considerations.  The Judge appropriately considered the nature  of  the
    property in which the appellant lives; how many people are living there
    and whether it is overcrowded (�52).  The  Judge  also  considered  the
    level of financial support and all of these  findings  led  up  to  the
    Judge's conclusion at �57 that the appellant did not meet the  criteria
    of serious and compelling family or other considerations. In  my  view,
    she reached her conclusion with clear and explicable  reasons  and  her
    decision on this limb, 297(i)(f),  discloses  no  error  of  law.   The
    Judge's findings and conclusion that the appellant does  not  meet  the
    criteria of paragraph 297(i)(f) of the Immigration Rules stand and  the
    appellant's appeal on this ground is dismissed.

27. That leaves the issue of the question of  paragraph  297(i)(e),  namely
    the question of sole parental responsibility.  On the one hand,  it  is
    important that I do not construe particular phrases in isolation;  that
    I read the Judge's decision as a whole; and I am equally conscious that
    the Judge will have heard all of the evidence, which I have not.

28. Nevertheless, I am satisfied that the Judge did materially err  in  law
    in relation to paragraph 297(i)(e) in two critical respects.  The first
    respect was in relation to the interim court document, to which I  have
    already referred.  On the one hand, I  am  sympathetic  to  Ms  Cunha's
    submission that the effect of the  assessment  by  the  Judge  and  the
    respondent was consistent, namely both had placed limited weight on the
    court order, the respondent because the court order had referred  to  a
    period  of  temporary  grant  of  custody  many  years  prior  to   the
    application for entry clearance, the  Judge  for  a  different  reason,
    namely because of the fact that there was no explanation for why it was
    a photocopy.

29. However, whilst limited weight may be applied  in  both  circumstances,
    there is an important difference.  The issues of whether  the  document
    is genuine, and its provenance, goes to the question of  the  sponsor's
    honesty and credibility.  In circumstances  where  the  credibility  is
    potentially an issue and whether  for  example  it  is  said  that  the
    sponsor in this case was inaccurate in her evidence of  describing  the
    circumstances of her parental responsibility, the  fact  that  she  may
    have been willing to  produce  a  document  whose  provenance  was  not
    accepted must, in my view, have been an important factor in the Judge's
    assessment of the sponsor and accordingly, to apply limited weight  for
    that reason,  when  the  provenance  was  never  raised  in  the  entry
    clearance manager review, does  amount  to  a  material  error,  as  it
    relates to the issue of credibility.

30. The second flaw is  in  the  Judge's  application  of  the  distinction
    between on the one hand,  day-to-day  care,  and  on  the  other,  sole
    parental responsibility, with the taking of all the important decisions
    in the appellant's life, as drawn in TD.  As Ms  Cunha  rightly  points
    out, the Judge reaches a conclusion on that point at �56.  However,  on
    reading the paragraphs leading up to that  conclusion,  which  comprise
    the entirety of the findings of fact from  �44  to  56,  I  accept  the
    challenge that Judge's findings relate to day-to-day care, rather  than
    the issue of sole parental  responsibility.  This  was  telling,  in  a
    passage I explored with Ms  Cunha,  about  whether  the  sponsor  could
    nevertheless retain sole responsibility, at �52, which states:

         "Since the separation of the appellant's  father  and  mother,  her
         grandmother has taken over the role of a parent in relation to  the
         appellant along with  the  sponsor.   In  such  a  scenario  it  is
         unlikely that either one of them would have sole responsibility  as
         one of them has the practical day-to-day care of the appellant  [my
         emphasis]."

31. Whilst Ms Cunha rightly submits that this should be considered  in  the
    wider context, nevertheless, the analysis continues at �53, whereby the
    sponsor's mother is describing a situation of  she  and  the  sponsor's
    sibling engaging in practical day-to-day support for the appellant  and
    discussing this with the sponsor.  �53 continues:

         "Albeit the sponsor may have a significant input in the outcome  of
         any discussions regarding the appellant this does  not  necessarily
         presuppose that she has sole responsibility  for  her.   There  are
         likely to be situations in which  it  is  simply  not  possible  to
         contact the sponsor due to the time difference and urgent decisions
         may need to be taken by the grandmother and her other  daughter  in
         relation to the appellant albeit they may discuss the matter  later
         on with the sponsor."

32. �54 follows on:

         "The sponsor and the appellant claimed that it is the  sponsor  who
         takes all the important decisions in the appellant's  life.   There
         was some inconsistency in the evidence in this  regard  as  between
         the appellant's  grandmother  and  the  sponsor.   In  reality  the
         practical day-to-day upbringing of the appellant is  likely  to  be
         heavily influenced by the grandmother."

33. The Judge clearly continues to base the  conclusion  that  the  sponsor
    does not have sole parental  responsibility  on  the  findings  of  the
    grandmother and aunt's heavy influence and  involvement  in  day-to-day
    upbringing, which, in my view, conflates the two distinct concepts.  In
    other words, the Judge finds that because the  grandmother  would  have
    heavily influenced the appellant's day-to-day  upbringing,  it  follows
    therefore that the sponsor cannot have  sole  parental  responsibility.
    In doing so, I conclude  that  the  judge  impermissibly  ruled  out  a
    potential  scenario  identified  by  the   Tribunal   in   TD,   namely
    circumstances where a non-resident  (typically  out-of-country)  parent
    may retain sole parental responsibility whilst somebody else  has  sole
    day-to-day care and responsibilities for the dependant child.

34. In the circumstances, whilst the Judge's decision was detailed and well-
    structured, nevertheless I am satisfied that there was a material error
    because the Judge failed to apply TD and provide clear reasoning as  to
    why sole parental responsibility was found to be  lacking,  beyond  the
    issue of day-to-day caring responsibilities.

35. The Judge's findings and conclusions in relation to paragraph 297(i)(e)
    are unsafe and must be set aside.

Disposal

36. With reference to paragraph 7.2  of  the  Senior  President's  Practice
    Statement, both representatives were  agreed  that  given  the  limited
    scope of the issues, it is appropriate that the Upper Tribunal  remakes
    the part of the Judge's decision which has been set aside.

Directions

37. The following directions shall apply to  the  future  conduct  of  this
    appeal:

      1. The Resumed Hearing will be listed before an Upper  Tribunal  Judge
         via Skype, at 10.30am on 19th January 2021 for two  hours,  without
         an interpreter, to  enable  the  Upper  Tribunal  to  substitute  a
         decision to either allow or  dismiss  the  appeal  in  relation  to
         paragraph  297(i)(e).

      2. The appellant shall no later than 4 PM on  5th  January  2021  file
         with  the  Upper  Tribunal  and  served   upon   the   respondent's
         representative  a  consolidated,  indexed,  and  paginated   bundle
         containing all the documentary evidence upon which she  intends  to
         rely. Witness statements in the bundle must be signed,  dated,  and
         contain a declaration of truth and shall stand as the  evidence  in
         chief of the maker who shall be made available for the purposes  of
         cross-examination and re-examination only.

      3. The respondent shall have leave, if so advised, to file any further
         documentation she intends to rely  upon  and  in  response  to  the
         appellant's evidence; provided the same is filed no later than 4 PM
         on 12th January 2021.

      4. No anonymity direction is made.

Notice of Decision

      1. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal in  relation  to  paragraph
         297(i)(f) Immigration Rules did not involve the making of an  error
         on a point of law. The Judge's  findings  and  conclusion  on  that
         issue are preserved.

      2. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal in  relation  to  paragraph
         297(i)(e) Immigration Rules, specially whether the sponsor has  had
         sole responsibility for the appellant's upbringing, did involve the
         making of an error on a point of  law.  The  Judge's  findings  and
         conclusion on that issue not safe and must be set aside.
