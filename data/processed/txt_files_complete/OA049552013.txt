                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms C Grubb, instructed by Hoole & Co. Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr I Richards, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a national of Jamaica.  He applied to  the  respondent
    for entry clearance with a view to settlement as  the  husband  of  the
    sponsor who is a British citizen.  On 5 February  2013  the  respondent
    refused his application.  The appellant put in a notice of appeal,  and
    in response an Entry Clearance Manager reviewed the decision and  added
    further reasons for refusal.  The appeal was heard by Judge A E  Walker
    in the First-tier Tribunal.  She heard oral evidence from  the  sponsor
    and considered a quantity of written evidence, particularly in relation
    to the sponsor's income.  She dismissed the appeal.  The appellant  now
    has permission to appeal to this Tribunal.

 2. Three discrete issues arose and arise for consideration:  two  of  them
    relate  to  the  Immigration  Rules  and  the  third  relates  to   the
    application of the art 8 of the European  Convention  on  Human  Rights
    outside the Rules.

Finance

 3. The Entry Clearance Officer's reason for refusing the  application  was
    that the appellant could not meet the  financial  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  The decision cites the relevant  rules,  and  notes
    the evidence provided  by  the  appellant,  derived  largely  from  the
    sponsor.  The decision notes also that the appellant proposed  to  work
    as a barber but that there was no  evidence  of  the  income  he  might
    receive.  The Officer's conclusion  was  that  the  appellant  had  not
    demonstrated that the sponsor's income from salaried employment was  at
    least �18,600 per annum, the threshold fixed by paragraph E-ECP.3.3  of
    Appendix FM to the Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules,  HC  395.
    It was for  that  reason  that  the  officer  refused  the  appellant's
    application.

 4. The judge had, as  we  have  said,  considerable  documentary  evidence
    before her.  She correctly reminded herself that she was concerned with
    the position at the date of the decision.  There was a  certain  amount
    of evidence that the sponsor was doing some part-time work as  well  as
    work arranged for her  through  Red  Recruitment.   Her  conclusion  in
    relation to the financial aspects of the application and appeal  is  at
    para 49 of her determination, which reads as follows:

          "49. I am satisfied by the payslips from Red Recruitment supported
          by the letter from them and the entry of  the  payments  into  the
          sponsor's bank account that the appellant earns �15,600 per  annum
          from that  employment.   I  accept  that  the  appellant  is  also
          employed by Minter cleaning and by Atlas Cleaning because payments
          from that employment are seen to enter her bank account.  However,
          the appellant seeks to rely upon the case of MM and others v  SSHD
          [2013]  EWHC  1900  (Admin).   This  case  is  authority  for  the
          proposition  that  the  financial  requirement   of   �18,600   is
          disproportionate and in terms of the  amount  required  should  be
          �13,500 and it therefore follows  that  the  appellant  meets  the
          financial requirements of the rules relying on her employment with
          Red Recruitment alone."

 5. Her decision on this issue was therefore in favour  of  the  appellant.
    It was not the  subject  of  any  submissions  before  us.   Since  the
    hearing, however, the decision to which the  judge  referred  has  been
    reversed by the Court of Appeal: SSHD v MM &  Others  [2014]  EWCA  Civ
    985.  It follows that, contrary to Judge Walker's view,  the  appellant
    needed to show that the sponsor's earning was �18,600 per year.  It  is
    clear that Judge Walker did not think that it was, and  it  is  equally
    clear that the evidence was not such as to show that it was.  There may
    have been some evidence of earnings of over �15,600, but there  was  no
    clear evidence that  those  additional  earnings  amounted  to  another
    �3,000.
 6. It follows that Judge Walker ought to have concluded that the appellant
    did not meet the financial requirement of the rules.  As we have  said,
    this is a matter on which we heard no argument.  We shall return  later
    to its impact on the outcome of this appeal.

The appellant's criminal conviction

 7. As we have said, the Entry  Clearance  Manager  added,  on  review,  an
    additional reason for refusing the appellant's application.

        "I would also like to take this opportunity  to  make  the  learned
        judge aware of an oversight on behalf of the ECO.  The  ECO  failed
        to take the appellant's past criminal history into account.  By his
        own admission the appellant confirmed that he had been convicted of
        a serious criminal offence (wounding with intent) and sentenced  to
        four years' imprisonment.  Under the current immigration rules that
        came into effect on 13/12/2012 (the same  day  that  the  appellant
        lodged his current application), the  appellant  should  have  been
        refused  under  paragraph  S-EC.1.4(a)  of  Appendix  FM   of   the
        Immigration Rules,

             "S-EC.1.4 the  exclusion  of  the  applicant  from  the  UK  is
             conducive to the public good because they have:


             (a) been convicted of an  offence  for  which  they  have  been
             sentenced to a period of imprisonment of at least 4 years;


             [...]


             Where this paragraph applies, unless refusal would be  contrary
             to the Human Rights Convention or the Convention  and  Protocol
             Relating to  the  Status  of  Refugees,  it  will  only  be  in
             exceptional  circumstances  that   the   public   interest   in
             maintaining refusal will be outweighed by compelling factors."

        Furthermore, I  am  not  satisfied  that  the  public  interest  in
        maintaining this refusal is outweighed by compelling factors.   The
        appellant married in 2011 and was convicted in 2008.  He  therefore
        had an opportunity to research whether his  conviction  may  affect
        any applications for entry clearance to the UK.  I am also aware of
        the fact that there is nothing in English law  that  prohibits  the
        appellant from enjoying family life in Jamaica.  I am therefore not
        persuaded to  alter  the  original  decision  for  the  reasons  as
        outlined above."

 8. Before the judge the sponsor asserted  that  she  was  unaware  of  the
    appellant's criminal record in Jamaica until his (earlier)  application
    for entry clearance.  The judge was also told that  the  appellant  was
    indeed sentenced to four years imprisonment, but  that  two  years  was
    subsequently suspended.  The judge regarded the evidence on this  point
    as "highly unsatisfactory".   She  concluded  that  the  appellant  had
    indeed been sentenced to imprisonment  for  four  years  and  that  his
    application therefore fell to be refused under the rules cited  by  the
    Entry Clearance Manager.

 9. In the grounds of appeal to this Tribunal the draftsman submitted  that
    a suspended sentence is not a custodial sentence  and  that  the  judge
    might have erred in law if  the  truth  of  the  matter  was  that  the
    sentence was suspended.  The judge  who  granted  permission  indicated
    that it would be for the appellant to produce a copy of the certificate
    of conviction in order to establish the point.  Before us there  was  a
    copy of a letter apparently signed  by  an  Assistant  Commissioner  of
    Police in Jamaica indicating that it was  not  possible  to  provide  a
    certificate but that the position  was  that  the  appellant  had  been
    convicted on 21  May  2008  (his  first  conviction);  the  charge  was
    Wounding with  Intent.   The  sentence  was  four  years  hard  labour,
    suspended for two years.  The details of  the  events  were  "during  a
    dispute the accused used a machete to chop complainant on his hand  and
    head".

10. Paragraph 6 of the Immigration Rules defines "a period of imprisonment"
    as having the same meaning as set out in s 38(2) of the UK Borders  Act
    2007.  That section provides at para (a) that a period of  imprisonment
    does not include a suspended  sentence,  unless  a  court  subsequently
    orders that the sentence or any part of  it  is  to  take  effect.   It
    follows that para S-EC.1.4(a) did not apply to the appellant,  and  the
    Entry Clearance Manager was wrong to take that point against him.

11. The judge did the best she could with the material before  her.   There
    is no room for  criticism  of  the  view  she  took  of  the  evidence.
    However, Mr Richards readily acknowledged  that  in  the  circumstances
    (which include a mystery as to the fate of the original certificate  of
    conviction, which was submitted to  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer)  it
    would be wrong to oppose the admission of the Police letter or to argue
    against a submission that an error of fact amounting to an error of law
    within the meaning of E & R v SSHD [2004] EWCA Civ 49 had occurred.

12. That seems to us to be right.  We accordingly conclude that  the  judge
    erred  in  her  application  of  the  exclusionary  provisions  of  the
    Immigration Rules to the appellant on the grounds of his conviction.

Article 8

13. As will be apparent from  the  above,  the  judge  concluded  that  the
    appellant did not meet  the  requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules.
    Although she thought (wrongly) that the  appellant  met  the  financial
    requirements of the rules, she  also  thought  (wrongly)  that  he  was
    excluded because of his criminal conviction.  She therefore went on  to
    consider whether, in the  light  of  all  the  evidence,  it  would  be
    disproportionate to apply the rules to the appellant or whether, on the
    contrary, the rights of the appellant, the sponsor, and the children to
    private and family life overrode the general rules.  After setting  out
    the general law she wrote as follows:

           "57. I am satisfied that here is a married relationship  between
           the appellant and the sponsor.  The sponsor  is  indeed  working
           all the hours available to her in order to  meet  the  financial
           requirements of the rules.  However, she and the appellant  have
           maintained their relationship since 2008  when  they  met.   The
           sponsor has visited the appellant regularly.  I accept that  the
           appellant and the sponsor cannot live together except in the  UK
           because I accept that the interests of  the  sponsor's  children
           are that they remain in the UK and the sponsor is the  carer  of
           her children.  They are both British citizens and the  sponsor's
           daughter has a relationship with her father who lives in the UK.
            As for the sponsor's son I accept the appellant's evidence with
           regard to the murder of his father and that  he  is  fearful  of
           travelling to Jamaica.   Both  children  are  settled  in  their
           schools.  I note that the sponsor has her mother to whom she has
           been able to turn to look after her daughter in the past  and  I
           am satisfied that when the sponsor visits the appellant she will
           be able to leave her children with her mother and  other  family
           members and friends as she has done on the past.   I  note  that
           the  sponsor's  children  aside  from  via  modern  methods   of
           communication have had very little contact with the appellant.


           58. Although  I  accept  that  whilst  the  sponsor  visits  the
           appellant her  children  will  be  deprived  of  her  care  that
           interference is at the very minimum level.  I consider  that  in
           light of my  finding  as  to  the  contact  that  the  sponsor's
           children have had with the appellant they do not have  a  family
           life with the appellant.


           59. It follows that I accept that the refusal is an interference
           that the appellant has with the sponsor  because  it  in  effect
           deprives him of the opportunity of living with the sponsor but I
           consider  that  the  interference  is   proportionate   to   the
           legitimate aim of effective immigration  control.   In  reaching
           that conclusion I take into  account  the  appellant's  previous
           conviction and my findings with regard to it.  A conviction  for
           wounding with intent, on the assumption  that  this  offence  in
           Jamaica is against the same framework as the English  equivalent
           of s 18 of the Offences  Against  the  Person  Act  1861  is  an
           extremely serious offence and one degree below that of attempted
           murder.  I also take into account the ability of  the  appellant
           and the sponsor to maintain their family life by visits  of  the
           sponsor to Jamaica where she also has family members and friends
           remaining."

The appeal to the Upper Tribunal

14. Much of the grounds of appeal is directed to identifying the  error  of
    law in relation to the appellant's criminal  conviction.   As  we  have
    indicated, we accept those grounds.  The judge was wrong to think  that
    the appellant was  excluded  by  reason  of  his  criminal  conviction.
    Submissions then moved to those based on art 8:  as we have said, there
    were no submissions in relation to finance at the hearing.  The grounds
    of appeal on art 8 are, in full, as follows:

           "Article 8


           19. The tribunal erred in law when assessing whether refusal was
           proportionate, the tribunal's decision is in breach of s.  6  of
           the Human Rights  Act  1998  and  section  55  of  the  Borders,
           Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009.  The Immigrations Judge:


        a) Failed to take into account that over  5  �  years  had  elapsed
           since the conviction
                     and so was nearly spent.
        b) Failed to take into account the offence was the Appellant's only
           over offence.
           c) Failed to  make  an  adequate  or  sufficient  assessment  of
              whether the Appellant and sponsor's Article  8  rights  could
              not reasonably have been expected to  be  enjoyed  elsewhere.
              The learned judge held that the Sponsor  and  children  could
              not reasonably be expected to move to Jamaica however  failed
              to  take  into  account  the  impact  on  the  Appellant  and
              Sponsor's private lives.
           d) Did  not  give  sufficient  reasons  why  the  Appellant  and
              Sponsor's  Article  8  rights  could  reasonably  have   been
              expected to be enjoyed elsewhere [see  paragraph  59  of  the
              judgement].   The  Immigration  Judge's   reasoning   instead
              focused on the Article 8 rights of the Sponsor's children. "

15. On the basis of those grounds Ms Grubb asked us to say that  the  judge
    ought  not  to  have  concluded  that  the  appellant's  exclusion  was
    conducive to the public good.  There was a family life derived from the
    marriage of the appellant and the sponsor.  The impact  requiring  them
    to live apart had to  be  considered.   Ms  Grubb  submitted  that  the
    appellant's offence was symptomatic of the society in which he lived in
    Jamaica: he had not committed any further offences even there,  and  it
    must be the case that the risk of him committing  further  offences  in
    the United Kingdom was low.  Mr Richards asked  us  to  note  that  the
    appellant's crime appeared to be a serious one, even  if  the  sentence
    was lenient.  He asked us to say  that  the  Article  8  findings  were
    unimpeachable.

16. Working on the judge's conclusion in relation to financial matters, and
    on our conclusion that she was wrong about the automatic  exclusion  of
    the appellant by reason of his offence, a further question then arises,
    which is whether para S-EC.1.5 of Appendix FM applies to the appellant.
     That paragraph is as follows:

           "The exclusion of the applicant from the UK is conducive to  the
           public good,  because,  for  example,  the  applicant's  conduct
           (including convictions which do not  fall  within  paragraph  S-
           EC.1.4.), character, associations, or  other  reasons,  make  it
           undesirable to grant them entry clearance."

17. We have no doubt at all on the evidence before us that the  appellant's
    offence is one justifying a conclusion that his admission to the United
    Kingdom is not conducive to the public good.  Ms  Grubb  may  be  right
    that it is an offence symptomatic of Jamaican society, but Mr  Richards
    was right to characterise it as a very serious  offence,  and  the  few
    official details that we have of it confirm that  description.   It  is
    all very well to say that at the date of the decision it was over  five
    years ago, and that it was the appellant's first  offence;  it  may  be
    that in due course the appellant will be able to show that there is  no
    risk of a further offence of that nature but we do not think that  that
    time has yet to come.

18. It  follows  that  in  our  judgment  the  appellant  cannot  meet  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules, not because of para S-EC.1.4  of
    Appendix FM, but because of S-EC.1.5.

19. We thus look at the matter outside the rules from a starting point very
    similar to that adopted by the judge.  In that context  we  agree  that
    her assessment shows no error of law.  Contrary to what is suggested in
    the grounds, the position  of  the  appellant,  the  sponsor,  and  the
    sponsor's children was considered by the judge.  So far as the  offence
    is concerned,  whichever  paragraph  of  Appendix  FM  applies  to  the
    appellant, it has to be recognised that  there  is  generally  speaking
    going to be difficulty in establishing that a  person  whose  exclusion
    from the United Kingdom is conducive  to  the  public  good  is  to  be
    admitted because he has married a British citizen.   The  balancing  of
    the public interest against the wishes of the appellant and the sponsor
    is a matter that the grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal appear  to
    ignore completely.  Looking at the matter as a whole in  the  light  of
    the grounds, as we do, we conclude not  merely  that  the  decision  of
    Judge Walker on Article 8 is one that was open to her on the basis from
    which she proceeded: it is also the  view  we  reach  on  the  slightly
    different basis upon which we proceed.

20. We must finally refer to the decision of the Court  of  Appeal  in  MM.
    For the reasons we have already given, our view is that  the  appellant
    does not meet the requirements of the rules because he is  excluded  by
    para S-EC.1.5 of Appendix FM, and that in those circumstances it is not
    disproportionate to apply the rules to him  and  so  refuse  him  entry
    clearance.  The decision of the Court of Appeal in MM  makes  it  clear
    that, in addition, the  Entry  Clearance  Officer's  original  decision
    refusing the appellant entry clearance for  his  failure  to  meet  the
    financial requirements of the rules was correct.   Thus,  in  order  to
    succeed  under  Article  8  he  would  have  to  show   that   it   was
    disproportionate to exclude him despite the fact that, as well as being
    a  person  convicted  of  a  serious  criminal  offence,  he  had   not
    demonstrated that his family was  going  to  have  a  level  of  income
    required by the rules.  It follows that if this factor were to be taken
    into account as well, the conclusion would have to be even more  firmly
    against the appellant.

21. The  judge  erred  in  law  in  her  application  of  the  exclusionary
    requirements of Appendix FM.   For that  reason  we  set  her  decision
    aside.  We substitute a decision dismissing the appellant's appeal  for
    the reasons we have given.
