                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 30th of March 1977.  She
    appeals against a decision on the papers of  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Dennis ("Judge Dennis") sitting at Taylor  House  on  10  July
    2015 but promulgated  on  4th  May  2016  in  which  he  dismissed  the
    Appellant's appeal against a decision of the Respondent dated  27th  of
    August 2014. That decision was to refuse  the  Appellant's  application
    for leave to enter the United Kingdom as a parent and primary carer  of
    an EEA national, her son A a British national born  February  2002  who
    lives with her in Pakistan. At first  instance  decision  Judge  Dennis
    found he did not have a valid appeal before him because of  an  earlier
    decision by another Judge,  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Flynn
    ("Judge Flynn"), promulgated on  21st  April  2015  which  allowed  the
    Appellant's appeal against a refusal by  the  Respondent  of  leave  to
    enter as a parent and primary carer.

 2. The Appellant's circumstances as known to Judge Dennis  were  that  the
    Appellant had married a Mr Malik a British national on  9  March  2000.
    Unfortunately, Mr Malik died two days before the birth of the  couple's
    son A in February 2002. A obtained his  British  nationality  from  his
    late father. The Appellant had remained an unmarried widow  and  stated
    that she had devoted her life to the care of her son. She was supported
    by her late husband's  NHS  pension  scheme  which  provided  her  with
    approximately �6,165 per annum. Her life had been difficult as a single
    mother lived as it was in the face of enmity from  her  late  husband's
    family. A now 14 wished to come to the United Kingdom for  medical  and
    educational purposes.

The Explanation for Refusal

 3. The Respondent refused the application under Regulation 15A (4) of  the
    Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006. The requirements
    of the Regulation were that the relevant EEA national, in this case  A,
    must be under the age of 18, residing in the United Kingdom as a  self-
    sufficient person and would be unable to remain in the  United  Kingdom
    if his primary carer were required to leave  the  United  Kingdom.  The
    difficulty for the Appellant  it  was  said  was  that  because  A  was
    studying at the [            ] Secondary School in Pakistan he was  not
    residing in the United Kingdom. Further as a child  A  would  not  hold
    sufficient resources to prevent himself  and  his  primary  carer  from
    becoming an unreasonable burden on  the  social  assistance  system  of
    United Kingdom. In addition, he did not have health insurance.

The Proceedings at First Instance

 4. The Appellant's appeal against this decision was lodged on 24 September
    2014. It argued that the Appellant's son wished to move to  the  United
    Kingdom but was not able to because he had no relative  in  the  United
    Kingdom who could look after him, his British  father  being  deceased.
    The decision  to  refuse  breached  European  law.  A  now  had  health
    insurance issued by a company called Freedom on 3 October 2014.

 5. The decision to refuse was reviewed by an Entry Clearance Manager (ECM)
    on 15th of December 2014 but was upheld by the ECM.  The  ECM  did  not
    accept the letter from the Freedom insurance company because the letter
    showed the Appellant had a period of time to cancel the policy  and  an
    excess of �500 was payable per person per policy. The Appellant had not
    demonstrated she had sufficient funds to  cover  such  an  excess.  The
    Appellant had not addressed the Respondent's  concerns  over  the  fact
    that the Appellant's son was not living in the United Kingdom as a self-
    sufficient person. The Respondent's view was that an application  under
    Regulation 15A could only be made where the EEA citizen and  the  carer
    were both in country.

 6. When the appeal came before Judge Dennis on 10 July 2015 he noted  from
    the papers (which were not complete) that there had been another appeal
    under case number OA/09249/2014 against  a  similar  refusal  of  entry
    clearance which had resulted in that appeal being allowed on  16  April
    2015 some three months earlier than the appeal listed before him. Judge
    Dennis had no copy of the determination of Judge Flynn but he took  the
    view that as the Appellant had  successfully  litigated  a  refusal  of
    entry clearance once already the proceedings before him were  moot,  (I
    assume because of the element of duplication). He  speculated,  because
    he did not have a full file, that the application made by the Appellant
    which resulted in the successful appeal before  Judge  Flynn  in  April
    2015 had been processed through the system more quickly than the matter
    which was on the papers before him. He did  not  have  a  valid  appeal
    before him because of the earlier successful outcome for the Appellant.
    As she had won her appeal and was now entitled to entry  clearance  the
    proceedings appeared to be wholly unnecessary.

The Onward Appeal

 7. The Appellant appealed against  the  decision  to  dismiss  her  appeal
    largely arguing the merits of the application  as  opposed  to  dealing
    with the jurisdictional point that this appeal was a duplicate  of  the
    successful appeal. The grounds argued that  the  Respondent's  decision
    breached the principles laid down in the case of  Zambrano  because  it
    interfered with the right of an EEA national  to  move  to  the  United
    Kingdom. Due to the Appellant's age and lack of relatives in the United
    Kingdom he could not move  on  his  own,  he  could  only  move  if  he
    travelled with the Appellant who was his  primary  carer.  Furthermore,
    the Appellant should have succeeded under Regulation  15A  (2)  of  the
    2006 Regulations. This provision states that an applicant  is  entitled
    to a derivative right of  residence  provided  that  the  relevant  EEA
    national is under the age of 18, is residing in the United Kingdom as a
    self-sufficient person and would be unable  to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom if the applicant were required to leave.

 8. I pause to note here that although not specifically addressed in  terms
    by the Respondent it is clear from the decision to refuse and the ECM's
    review that the same difficulty appeared to  arise  for  the  Appellant
    under Regulation 15A (2) namely that her son  was  not  living  in  the
    United Kingdom at present. Both sub paragraphs 2 and  4  of  Regulation
    15A require the EEA national to be residing in the United Kingdom which
    the Appellant's son is not. The Appellant's response  to  this  in  the
    onward grounds of appeal was to argue  that  there  was  no  reason  in
    principle why Zambrano could not apply to entry clearance  cases.  This
    was so, since it was said in the case  of  Dereci  a  decision  of  the
    European Union Court of Justice that a member state  must  ensure  that
    any refusal does not lead, for the  Union  citizen  concerned,  to  the
    denial of  the  genuine  enjoyment  of  the  substance  of  the  rights
    conferred by virtue of his status as a citizen of the union.  Crucially
    the onward grounds of appeal cited Regulation 11 (5) (b)  of  the  2006
    Regulations  which  provides  that  an  applicant  meets  the  relevant
    criteria for admission as the family member of an EEA national if  that
    family member would otherwise be entitled  to  a  derivative  right  of
    residence because both the applicant and the EEA national were  already
    in the United Kingdom.

 9. The application for permission to appeal  came  on  the  papers  before
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Page on 30th  of  September  2016.  He
    refused permission to appeal largely because there were no  grounds  of
    appeal attached to the application before him.  The  Appellant  renewed
    her application for permission referring  to  various  documents  which
    showed her financial position for example that she  held  property  and
    had jewellery. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge
    Plimmer on 28 November 2016 as it was arguable that the First-tier  had
    failed to resolve the apparent inconsistencies between the Respondent's
    decision under appeal dated 27th  of  August  2014  and  Judge  Flynn's
    findings in the April 2015 decision when the Appellant  was  successful
    and which had addressed very similar issues.

The Hearing Before Me

10. At the hearing  before  me  it  was  acknowledged  by  the  Appellant's
    solicitor that the Appellant had indeed made two applications for entry
    clearance on the same basis namely that she was the mother and  primary
    carer of a British and thus EEA citizen. I was provided with a copy  of
    the decision of Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  Flynn  allowing  the
    Appellant's appeal. I summarise that decision  below.  The  explanation
    for the two applications according to  the  Appellant's  solicitor  was
    that the Appellant had been  unable  to  avail  herself  of  the  entry
    clearance granted to her following her successful appeal due to  health
    issues and knowing that she would be unable to take  up  the  Visa  she
    decided to apply again.

11. The difficulty for the Appellant in such a course of action  (which  as
    it happens was not the precise sequence of events) was that  she  would
    run the risk that her 2nd application perhaps considered by a different
    official would again be refused  (as  it  duly  was).  The  Appellant's
    argument was that she had  established  in  the  first  and  successful
    appeal before Judge Flynn that she  was  entitled  to  entry  clearance
    under the 2006  Regulations.  Nothing  of  relevance  had  changed  and
    therefore  this  appeal  against  the  August  2014   decision   should
    automatically have been allowed. Although  the  Appellant's  course  of
    action in proceeding with a 2nd application for entry clearance  whilst
    in possession of entry clearance (or at any rate  a  successful  appeal
    which would lead to entry clearance) was unusual that she  did  not  in
    fact take up the visa did not of itself mean that the 2nd appeal before
    Judge Dennis was invalid. For the Respondent it was argued  that  there
    was no such doctrine that once an entitlement to a derivative right  of
    residence had been established it would follow that every  further  and
    subsequent application  for  entry  clearance  would  automatically  be
    granted. Each application would have to be decided on  its  own  merits
    each time it was made.

The Successful Appeal

12. The Appellant applied for entry clearance but was refused on 23rd  July
    2014 on the ground that A was not in the United Kingdom as required  by
    Regulation 15A of the 2006 Regulations (in other words the same  ground
    as in the appeal before Judge Dennis). Her  appeal  came  before  Judge
    Flynn on 20th March 2015. She allowed the appeal relying on  the  Upper
    Tribunal authority of MA [2013] UKUT 380 that an applicant outside  the
    United Kingdom could rely on the decision in Zambrano as  long  as  the
    applicant had the intention (as the Appellant in this case did have) to
    accompany the EEA national child  to  the  United  Kingdom.  The  Upper
    Tribunal referred to the amendments to Regulation  11  which  permitted
    this (see the Appellant's argument I summarise at  paragraph  8  above)
    and amended the wording of Regulation 15A. Following this outcome,  the
    Respondent issued the Appellant with an entry clearance visa valid from
    11th August 2015 until 11th February 2016.

Findings

13. The first issue I have to decide is whether there was  a  valid  appeal
    before Judge Dennis. If there was not then his decision to dismiss  the
    appeal because there was no point  to  the  litigation,  the  Appellant
    having already succeeded in litigation  on  the  same  point  would  be
    correct in law and no appeal would lie from the  Judge's  decision.  On
    the other hand, if it was open to the Appellant to appeal  against  the
    Respondent's decision of August 2014 then Judge Dennis would  be  wrong
    in law in finding no valid appeal. His decision would then have  to  be
    set aside and the matter would have to be  looked  at  on  its  merits.
    Either way the facts of the case were for the most part not in dispute,
    this was a relatively narrow and discreet issue and whether  or  not  I
    found a material error of  law  the  case  could  be  adjudicated  upon
    without the need to be remitted back to the First-tier.

14. If an  Appellant  has  received  two  appealable  decisions,  they  are
    entitled to two appeals. The Tribunal of course in the exercise of  its
    case management powers might well find that it is  more  convenient  to
    list both appeals together  assuming  they  are  close  in  time.   The
    decision of Judge Flynn in April 2015 has  not  been  appealed  by  the
    Respondent and I would respectfully add is correct in law.  Subject  to
    there being no change of circumstances since then it is  reasonable  to
    expect  a  Tribunal  determination  on  the  Respondent's  August  2014
    decision to be in line with the April 2015 First-tier Tribunal decision
    and to allow the appeal. This is an unusual  case  and  in  the  normal
    course of events it is to be hoped that what has happened here would be
    avoided in the future. Either an Appellant's solicitor should write  in
    to the Tribunal advising that there were two  appeals  and  asking  for
    them to be linked or the Respondent would notice that  there  were  two
    appeals on the same  subject  matter  and  would  notify  the  Tribunal
    accordingly.

15. Islamabad is a busy post and it was perhaps to be expected that the two
    applications coming as they did a certain number of months apart  would
    be adjudicated upon separately with two refusals. Judge Flynn does  not
    indicate in her determination when  the  Appellant  applied  for  entry
    clearance only that the application was  refused  on  23rd  July  2014.
    Given the many thousands of appeals which the Tribunal's administration
    in this country have to deal with  on  a  daily  basis  it  is  perhaps
    unreasonable to have expected the Tribunal of its own  motion  to  have
    noticed that there were  two  appeals  in  the  system  from  the  same
    Appellant on the same point. The risk for the  Appellant  was  that  by
    making more than one application on the same point and thus having more
    than one appeal in the system the  impression  might  be  created  that
    there was an abuse of process.

16. It is important in this case to establish  the  precise  chronology  of
    events. The first refusal of the Respondent was dated  July  2014.  The
    appeal went to Judge Flynn. A month  later  on  18th  August  2014  the
    Appellant applied again and this was refused nine days  later  on  27th
    August 2014. This second refusal eventually came before  Judge  Dennis.
    Judge Flynn heard her case in March 2015  and  allowed  the  appeal  in
    April 2015. Judge Dennis heard his case in July 2015. The Appellant was
    issued with six months'  entry  clearance  in  August  2015  which  had
    expired by the time Judge Dennis finally promulgated his  determination
    in May 2016. I pause to note here that the  issue  of  the  Appellant's
    medical insurance did not appear to feature in the earlier appeal and I
    accept the evidence provided that such insurance  does  exist.  By  the
    time Judge Dennis ruled that the  appeal  before  him  was  "moot"  the
    situation had thus changed again. Whether  or  not  the  Appellant  had
    taken up the earlier grant of entry clearance she no longer  had  entry
    clearance to accompany A. The situation might have  been  different  if
    Judge Dennis had promulgated  his  decision  shortly  after  the  paper
    hearing. This would have led to a difficult  procedural  point  whether
    the appeal before him was indeed moot. I find I do not have  to  decide
    that point which I leave open.

17. The Appellant no longer had leave to enter and thus  by  May  2016  the
    appeal was of very great  interest  to  her  and  A.  The  Respondent's
    objections were not valid in  law  and  her  appeal  should  have  been
    allowed as was the appeal before Judge Flynn. I  appreciate  the  point
    made by the Respondent that even if a past appeal has been allowed that
    does not mean that future appeals must always  be  allowed.  Each  case
    must be decided on its merits but here I cannot  discern  any  relevant
    change of circumstances since Judge  Flynn's  decision  save  that  the
    Appellant admits she did not take up  the  grant  of  leave  to  enter,
    saying she was ill at the time. Failing to take up leave is  a  serious
    matter not least because of the risks of genuine grants going astray in
    the circumstances. There being no evidence to the contrary I accept the
    submission that the Appellant had a good reason for failing to take  up
    the grant of leave. However, I would add that if  the  Appellant  again
    fails to take up any period of leave to enter which is issued to her  a
    third appeal might well be looked upon as an abuse of  process  but  we
    are I trust a long way away from that eventuality. In large part due to
    the effluxion of time and the change in the factual matrix as a  result
    thereof the Appellant's  appeal  should  have  been  allowed  at  first
    instance. There was a material error of law in the decision and  I  set
    it aside. I remake the decision by allowing the appeal.





Notice of Decision

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law and I have set it aside. I remake the decision in this  case  by
    allowing the Appellant's appeal.

    I allow the Appellant's appeal.

    I make no anonymity order as there is no public policy  reason  for  so
    doing.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

Judge Dennis dismissed the appeal and made no fee  award.  Although  I  have
set his decision to dismiss aside I leave intact his decision  to  refuse  a
fee award. At the time of the paper appeal before  Judge  Dennis  in  August
2015  there  were  reasonable  grounds  to  believe  that  the  appeal   was
unnecessary notwithstanding I have not  had  to  make  a  decision  on  that
specific point.

I make no fee award.
