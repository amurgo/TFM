Representation:

For the Appellant:      In person
For the Respondent:    Mr S. Walker, Senior Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. The Appellant is a citizen of Brazil born on 18 June 1979. He
       appeals with permission against the decision of First-tier Tribunal
       Judge Roots, who in a decision promulgated on 31 May 2018 dismissed
       his appeal against the decision of the Respondent made on 24 January
       2018 to refuse his application for a residence card as a family
       member of an EEA national. The case was heard on the papers as
       requested by the applicant.

    2. On 10 November 2017 he made an application for a residence card to
       confirm that he was a family member of an EEA national exercising
       treaty rights in the United Kingdom.

    3. On 24 January 2018 the Respondent refused that application for the
       following reasons;

         . the application was considered under Regulation 7 of the
           Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2016

         . However the Respondent considered that the Appellant had not
           provided adequate evidence to show that he qualified for a right
           to reside as a family member of his EEA sponsor. He had applied
           for a residence card as a direct family member of a Portuguese
           national, Marcelina Ribeiro and submitted a Brazilian birth
           certificate as evidence of the relationship. However as he was
           over the age of 21 years old he is not automatically issued on
           the basis of the relationship to the EEA national sponsor. Once
           the direct family member reaches the age of 21, they must submit
           evidence to prove that they are dependent upon their EEA
           national sponsor in the UK.

         . In the application form it was stated that the Appellant was the
           carer of his mother since she suffered a stroke. That was
           acknowledged along with a letter from the clinic stating that
           the sponsor/affected eyesight however the sponsor has remained
           employed and self-employed. If the applicant was a carer for the
           EEA national sponsor and that she was dependent upon him, she
           would be receiving disability living allowance as temporarily
           incapacitated.

         . The applicant has submitted no evidence to show that he was
           dependent upon the EEA national sponsor as required by the EEA
           regulations. The only document submitted in the applicant's name
           showing him living at the same property is the EEA national
           sponsor was a tenancy agreement showing the applicant and
           sponsor as tenants of 18 B Road NW10. Bank statements submitted
           for the EEA sponsor did not show evidence that she supported him
           financially through bank transfers. He had submitted
           insufficient evidence of dependency and the application has been
           refused on this basis.

    4. The Appellant lodged an appeal on 4 March 2018 (in it he applied for
       an extension of time because he the sponsor did not get the decision
       until mid-February 2018 having been evicted by the landlord on 30
       January 2018).

    5. In the grounds he stated that he had provided all relevant evidence
       in support and that although he was over 21 years of age, his mother
       depended on him and he had provided care for her since she had
       suffered a stroke and that he had been dependent on her to stay in
       the United Kingdom to give her full dedication and care. She is
       working a few hours part time as an employee to exercise her rights
       in the UK under the EEA regulations.

    6. The appeal came before Judge Roots on the papers on 2 May 2018.

    7. The judge noted at [5] that he was not provided with any
       Respondent's bundle

    8. The Appellant provided a letter dated 9 April 2018 and some
       supporting documents.

    9. The judge at [7] set out that the burden of proof was on the
       Appellant to show on the balance of probabilities that he was
       dependent on his mother and that there was no definition of
       dependence in the Regulations it was a question of fact. The judge's
       findings set out at paragraph 8 - 11 in which the judge found that
       the Appellant had not demonstrated that he was dependent on his
       mother. The reasons given were as follows:

        1) There is no statement from his mother setting out income and how
           she supports her son did not clear what had total income is.

        2) The payslip provided for her suggest she normally earns about
           �490 per month; the pasted of December 2017 show that she'd
           received total pay of �2775 to date in that tax year the
           Appellant has provided no cogent explanation or evidence as to
           how she support to people on that income.

        3) The judge placed no great weight on the reference of disability
           living allowance.

        4) The judge consider the letter of 9 April 2018 and the documents
           attached. It is for the Appellant to show dependency. The judge
           set out the Appellant's case that he was also a carer for his
           mother. The judge observed "Whilst I have considered the
           documents provided it is not for me to put together the
           Appellant's case him - he has to present the evidence that he is
           dependent on his mother. I cannot see any clear statement of any
           specific sums which is mother gives him to support him, out of
           her apparently very low income. There is no witness statement
           from the Appellant, or even a clear statement in a letter,
           setting out how his basic needs are met. I accept that there
           appears to be evidence suggesting that they live together, but
           that is not sufficient to establish dependency."

   10. The Appellant sought permission to appeal that decision. The
       Appellant drafted his own grounds and they appear to state as
       follows. His application for a residence card was at the dependent
       of his mother on the grounds that his mother strictly required the
       personal care on serious health grounds as well as psychological and
       economically. The judge decided only on the grounds of financial
       dependency rather than a relative who strictly requires the personal
       care of. He cites the application form pages 28 - 29 and 40 - 42 and
       74 - 75 submitted to the Home Office and he chose "a relative who
       strictly requires the personal care of the EEA national on serious
       health grounds." He states his application was based on that option
       and evidence was sent to support the application. The Respondent did
       not provide a bundle of evidence but the Appellant states he sent a
       statutory declaration in which the sponsor mentioned the grounds of
       dependency and her long-term illness. This original document went
       missing it has been sent to the Home Office. He stated that the
       application was submitted based on the dependency of his sponsor who
       strictly required his personal care on her serious health grounds.
       In addition his sponsor is also dependent on me economically but had
       not been to carry out any jobs in the United Kingdom. Dependency is
       mutual and reciprocal. He stated "I am sending new evidence to prove
       that she has exercise activities as an employee and self-employed to
       support this dependency financially too. We are still in low-income
       and receiving housing benefit and working tax credit under her name
       only because I do not have a passport".

   11. Permission to appeal that decision was granted by first-tier
       Tribunal judge Hollingworth. The reasons given were as follows:-

           "The judge has referred to not having been provided with any
           Respondent's bundle. The case was decided on the papers. An
           Appellant is entitled to presume that the Respondent's bundle
           would be provided to the judge. The judge referred to paragraph
           6 of the decision to that which the Appellant provided. Given
           the approach explained in the permission application it is
           arguable that the scope for interpretation differed and that in
           any event available evidence had not been provided to the judge.
           In the circumstances and fairness can have been seen to have
           arisen. It was not possible for the judge to clarify the extent
           of the available evidence."

   12. At the hearing before the Tribunal the Appellant appeared in person
       and represented himself. I ensured that he understood the nature of
       the proceedings and he was assisted by the court interpreter who I
       am satisfied understood the Appellant and vice versa. In the earlier
       part of this decision I have summarised the grounds upon which the
       Appellant relied (in the form of a letter dated 10 June 2018) in
       addition he had provided a letter dated 14 September 2018 which
       provided further detail of his circumstances and that of his mother.
       In that letter it made reference to having made a first application
       refused by the Home Office on 20 February 2015. It was asserted that
       there had been problems in receiving the adverse refusal decision
       and only did so from the person who was assisting him in December
       2016. The Appellant claimed to have arrived in the United Kingdom on
       24 May 2014 by way of a tourist visa stamp. The chronology is not
       entirely clear from the letter. The letter also made reference to
       the decision letter and that the application for a residence card as
       a dependent of his mother was submitted to the Respondent on the
       grounds that his mother required personal care on serious health
       grounds and that the judge had only considered financial dependency.
       He also made reference to sending  further new evidence relating to
       the issues including that of dependency and filed some witness
       statements.

   13. Mr Walker appeared on behalf of the Respondent. In his submissions
       he accepted that the FTTJ had not taken account of all of the
       documentation which the Appellant had sought to rely on or the
       particular basis upon which the application had been made and that
       there had been procedural unfairness as a result.

   14. I find the Respondent's concession to be appropriately made, and in
       the circumstances, I give only summary reasons for finding that the
       decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of a
       material error of law such that it is necessary to set aside the
       decision.


   15.  Paragraph  24  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (First-tier  Tribunal)
       (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Rules 2014 includes the requirement
       for the Respondent to provide the First-tier Tribunal with specified
       documents in relation to the decision under appeal,  which  was  not
       complied with by the Respondent in the present case as  set  out  in
       the decision at paragraph 5. Whilst acknowledged there was no bundle
       of documents from the Respondent, no further consideration was given
       as to whether the case should be adjourned for this to  be  obtained
       (and see Cvetkovs (visa - no  file  produced  -  directions)  Latvia
       [2011] UKUT 00212). Whilst the judge  had  some  documentation  (see
       paragraph 10), it is not apparent that all  the  documentation  upon
       which the Appellant  relied  had  been  put  before  the  First-tier
       Tribunal. The judge made reference to their being a lack of evidence
       in respect of the Appellant's mother  and  the  Appellant  has  made
       reference to a statutory declaration that she had  made.  Mr  Walker
       accepted that not all of the documentation that the Appellant sought
       rely upon had been before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  in  those
       circumstances accepts that there was procedural unfairness.


   16. Whilst the appeal was originally heard on the papers, the  Appellant
       now seeks an oral hearing by which further evidence  will  be  given
       including that of witnesses.  The  grounds  also  attached  what  he
       described as "fresh evidence" which he would wish to  be  considered
       and has confirmed that whilst he has  provided  a  short  statement,
       that he will provide a fuller chronology setting  out  his  case  to
       enable the Tribunal to properly consider  the  issues.  This  was  a
       difficulty before the First Tier Tribunal as set  out  at  paragraph
       10.


   17. I am therefore satisfied that there has been a material error of law
       which has led to the Tribunal not deciding  the  disputed  facts  in
       this appeal. I therefore set aside the decision of the judge in  its
       entirety. I have taken into account paragraph 7.2  of  the  practice
       statements for the Immigration and  Asylum  Cis  of  the  First-tier
       Tribunal and the Upper Tribunal which recognises that it may not  be
       possible for the Upper Tribunal shall proceed to remake the decision
       when it is satisfied that (a) the effect of the error  has  been  to
       deprive a party before the First-tier Tribunal of a fair hearing  or
       other opportunities that party's case to be put to and considered by
       the First-tier Tribunal; or (b) the nature or extent of any judicial
       fact-finding which is necessary in order for  the  decision  in  the
       appeal to be remade is such that, having regard  to  the  overriding
       objective 2, it is appropriate to remit the case of  the  First-tier
       Tribunal. Having exercised my  discretion  and  by  considering  the
       practice statement, the case falls within (a) given that there was a
       procedural unfairness and also under (b) given that the  court  will
       now  hear  oral  evidence  from  the  Appellant  and  witnesses  and
       therefore I am satisfied that the appropriate course is to remit the
       case to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh hearing.


Decision:


    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the  making  of  an
    error on a point of law and the appeal is allowed; the decision of  the
    First-tier Tribunal shall be set aside and remitted to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal for a further hearing.
