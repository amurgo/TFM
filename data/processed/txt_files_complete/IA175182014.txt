                 Secretary of State for the Home Department

Representation:

For the appellant:     Ms M Atcha, instructed by Ibraham & Co
For the respondent:    Ms A Everett, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Ilona Vasiljeva-Aftab,  date  of  birth  29.7.94,  is  a
    citizen of Latvia.

 2. This is her appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Anthony promulgated 13.2.15, dismissing her appeal against the decision
    of the Secretary of State to refuse her application made on 22.8.13 for
    an EEA Registration Certificate,  pursuant  to  the  Immigration  (EEA)
    Regulations 2006.  The Judge heard the appeal on 30.1.15.

 3. Judge Anthony also heard the linked appeal of Muhammad Asad Aftab,  who
    had applied for an EEA Residence Card on the basis of being the  family
    member (spouse) of Ms Vasiljeva-Aftab an EEA national exercising Treaty
    rights in the UK. The judge reached the conclusion that their  marriage
    was not genuine but was one of convenience entered into  for  the  sole
    purpose of enabling Mr Aftab to remain in the UK and thus  not  outside
    the definition of  spouse  in  regulation  2.  The  protection  of  the
    Regulations does not extend to a marriage of convenience.

 4. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Fisher  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    15.4.15 in respect of this appellant only.  In  respect  of  Mr  Aftab,
    Judge Fisher considered that it was open to the judge on the  evidence,
    including the marriage interview summary, to conclude that the marriage
    was one of convenience, and thus did not grant permission. Mr Aftab has
    not renewed his application for permission to appeal and thus I  cannot
    consider his case.

 5. However, in simply  dismissing  the  appeal  Judge  Anthony  failed  to
    distinguish between this appellant and Mr Aftab. Whilst  Mr  Aftab  may
    not be entitled to an EEA Residence Certificate, at �13 of the decision
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge was satisfied that Ms Vasiljeva-Aftab was
    exercising Treaty rights in the UK and is a qualified  person  pursuant
    to regulation 6. She was, therefore, entitled to the  EEA  Registration
    Certificate sought.

 6. The matter came before me on 5.6.15 as an appeal in the Upper Tribunal.



 7. In the Rule 24 response, dated 23.4.15, the Secretary of State  accepts
    that the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  in  respect  of  the
    appellant granted permission to appeal was in error of  law  and  I  am
    invited to allow her appeal. I do so for the reasons set out above, but
    only in relation to Ms Vasiljeva-Aftab, adopting the  findings  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal at �13 of the decision.

 8. The findings of the judge that theirs is a marriage of convenience  and
    dismissing the appeal of Mr Aftab must stand.

Conclusions:

 9. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

     I set aside the decision in respect of Ms Vasiljeva-Aftab.

                    I re-make the decision in  her  appeal  by  allowing  it
                    under the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make a whole fee award.

Reasons: The appeal in respect of Ms Vasiljeva-Aftab has been allowed.
