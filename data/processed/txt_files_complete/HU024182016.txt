                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of Oluwasenfunmi Dare  Muda-Lawal,  a  citizen  of
       Nigeria born 9 October 1989, against the decision of  the  First-tier
       tribunal of 7 December 2017 dismissing  his  appeal,  itself  brought
       against the decision to refuse his human rights claim  of  8  January
       2016.

    2. The immigration history supplied by the Secretary of  State  set  out
       that the Appellant entered the UK on 1 August 2002 with a visit  visa
       valid until 25 October 2002. He made an application outside the Rules
       for leave on 20 October 2009 which was subsequently rejected for want
       of completion of the application form;  an  application  of  February
       2010 was refused in March 2010, and one of July 2012 was refused on 8
       August 2013. He was encountered by a Home Office enforcement team  at
       his home address on 26 August 2013 and served with  notice  of  being
       treated as an overstayer. He  submitted  a  statement  of  additional
       grounds on 8 September 2015 leading to  the  refusal  letter  against
       which the instant proceedings were launched.

    3. His further grounds for remaining in the UK were based on his lengthy
       residence in the UK and his relationship with Barbara Agyeman-Dua,  a
       British citizen, and with his family members here: his  sister  (with
       whom he lived), mother, aunts and cousins, whereas he had no ties  in
       Nigeria. Theirs was a genuine  and  devoted  relationship;  the  only
       reason they did not cohabit  was  because  of  their  personal  moral
       beliefs.

    4. The Appellant was a co-founder of 7 Elohim (together with  his  close
       friend Harry  Uzoka),  a  creative  collective  of  designers,  event
       planners, artists, producers, singers, poets and rappers, which aimed
       to inspire a  new  generation  of  London  youths  to  overcome  gang
       culture, violence and  disconnection.  Elohim's  activities  included
       organising football tournaments and marketing clothing  brands;  they
       also helped the homeless.

    5. His application was refused because it  was  not  accepted  that  his
       relationship qualified for consideration under Appendix FM, as he did
       not cohabit with his partner, and in any event there was  a  lack  of
       evidence confirming that the relationship  was  genuine.  There  were
       considered to be no very significant  obstacles  to  his  integration
       back in Nigeria where he could take advantage of his education to re-
       establish  himself.  Overall  his  case  presented   no   exceptional
       circumstances warranting the grant of leave.

    6. He appealed against that decision on 22 January 2016, and his  appeal
       was duly heard by the First-tier tribunal. His evidence was supported
       by that of Harry Uzoka, who detailed their mutual  social  activities
       and said that they supported one another financially via the proceeds
       of their work with Elohim.

    7. Ms Agyeman-Dua gave evidence, stating that she was born in Ghana  and
       was an only child; she had lived in the UK since the  age  of  eight.
       She worked as a Radiographer with Royal Marsden NHS  Trust.  She  had
       met the Appellant four years ago  and  their  relationship  began  at
       once; they were engaged and planned to marry, though they  felt  they
       were not quite ready to do so yet, pending achieving some  degree  of
       financial security. They were deeply in love and she  was  devastated
       at the thought of not being able to see him. Having no siblings,  she
       had attributed particular importance to their relationship.

    8. The First-tier tribunal dismissed the Appellant's appeal. It did  not
       accept that he had established family life with Ms Agyeman-Dua  given
       their circumstances were more akin to a friendship or romance falling
       short of a durable relationship. The evidence of his friend Mr  Uzoka
       was vague regarding the relationship;  no  other  witness  referenced
       their relationship. His sister  had  provided  no  witness  statement
       evidence.  The  evidence  regarding  his  mother's  whereabouts   was
       inconsistent: the Appellant said he  was  not  in  contact  with  her
       whereas Ms Agyeman-Dua had said she saw her the previous month at the
       sister's home. He had provided no evidence of the immigration  status
       of his mother and sister, though  the  latter  clearly  had  no  such
       status. It was unclear as to how he was supported  financially  given
       his own evidence was that he was supported by Ms Agyeman-Dua  and  Mr
       Uzoka, yet the latter had referred to the Appellant having income  of
       his own.

    9. Although he had been brought here as a  child,  he  had  subsequently
       been deliberately misleading as to the circumstances of his  original
       entry and his mother's  immigration  status;  his  witness  statement
       indicated that he came to join his sister and her  spouse  though  in
       reality she was only a little older than him, and thus like him  must
       have been only a youngster herself when  he  arrived.  There  was  no
       evidence that his father was deceased.

   10. He could not satisfy any of the private life routes  specified  under
       Rule 276ADE, as he was not a child or aged between 18 and 25, and had
       not lived here for more than 20 years; there were no very significant
       obstacles to integration back  in  Nigeria  given  that  English  was
       widely spoken there and he could use his qualifications including his
       degree and the skills from his work here on his return.

   11. Considering his case outside the Rules, his working achievements were
       unclear, and whilst  he  had  friends  and  a  girlfriend  here,  the
       precariousness of his residence  counted  against  him.  He  was  not
       dependent on anyone in the UK. He had been brought here at the age of
       12 under the direction and control of adults, and first  applied  for
       leave to remain aged twenty. He had qualifications and skills to  use
       on a return. He was not dependent on anyone in the UK. Mr  Uzoka  and
       Ms Agyeman-Dua could send him  money  in  Nigeria  to  help  him  re-
       establish himself there. It would be open to him to marry Ms Agyeman-
       Dua who could then sponsor his return via the entry clearance  route.
       As to section 117B, precariousness aside, he spoke English though his
       income was not documented. Overall his departure would not  represent
       a disproportionate interference with his family and private life.

   12. Grounds of appeal submitted that the First-tier tribunal had erred in
       law in

        a) Assessing the relationship between the Appellant and his claimed
           partner without regard to their mutual evidence of the  fact  of
           their engagement  and  overlooking  the  Whatsapp  messages  and
           photographs that had been provided - Mr Uzoka in particular  had
           given  oral   evidence   regarding   the   strength   of   their
           relationship;

        b) Making unreasonable findings  as  to  the  Appellant's  mother's
           status given he entered the UK aged 12;

        c) Making an unreasonable finding  that  there  would  be  no  very
           significant obstacles to integration back in Nigeria  given  the
           lack of social infrastructure absent any friends or family  with
           whom he retained links;

        d) Failing to take account of  his  nearly  qualifying  under  Rule
           276ADE(v) as a young person who had  lived  here  for  half  his
           life.

  Error of law hearing

   13. The First-tier tribunal having refused permission  to  appeal  on  26
       February 2018, permission was granted by the  Upper  Tribunal  on  20
       June 2018, recognising the force of each of  the  grounds  of  appeal
       summarised above.

   14. Before me the Appellant appeared  without  a  representative,  as  he
       could not afford one. I explained  the  limitations  on  the  process
       today and that the Upper Tribunal could only overturn the decision of
       the First-tier Tribunal on the  basis  of  errors  of  law  based  on
       evidence that had been before it.

   15. The Appellant told me that since the  hearing  below  his  friend  Mr
       Uzoka had tragically passed away. There was a  special  bond  between
       him and his partner.  The  Judge  below  had  been  right  about  his
       mother's immigration status: she was still trying to  regularise  her
       presence in the UK. In  the  period  leading  up  to  the  First-tier
       Tribunal hearing, he had  been  living  with  Mr  Uzoka  whilst  they
       developed their business, having previously lived with his sister. He
       had no connections whatsoever in Nigeria; his father had died  before
       the Appellant's second birthday. He saw his  ongoing  activities  for
       Elohim as central to realising the ambition he  had  shared  with  Mr
       Uzoka to improve the life of youngsters in their community.

   16. Mr Walker submitted that whilst the  First-tier  Tribunal  had  given
       only a brief reference to the Appellant's near-miss under  the  young
       person route, its conclusions were legally adequate. The  immigration
       status of the Appellant's relatives  were  unclear  on  the  evidence
       before it, and it was not established that he had any close relatives
       living in this country lawfully.

  Findings and reasons - Error of Law Hearing

   17. The Appellant relied  on  two  significant  strands  of  evidence  to
       support his case to remain in the UK. There was the relationship with
       Ms Agyeman-Dua, and his strong private life ties with various friends
       and family in this country including his establishment and pursuit of
       his community-focussed work with Elohim, all of which contrasted with
       his lack of ties in Nigeria. The First-tier  Tribunal  dismissed  the
       Appellant's appeal on the basis that  it  did  not  accept  that  his
       relationship was a durable one, and the latter essentially because it
       considered that he had not adequately explained his asserted lack  of
       connections with his country of origin.

   18. It seemed to me that there were material errors of  law  in  both  of
       these findings.

   19. I considered the First-tier Tribunal  was  wrong  to  categorise  the
       evidence  of  the  Appellant  and  Ms  Agyeman-Dua  regarding   their
       engagement to be unreliable. They  had  both  given  clear  oral  and
       witness statement evidence to such effect. No reason  was  given  for
       doubting their evidence. So far as I could make out from  the  record
       of proceedings, it did appear that Harry Uzoka had at least mentioned
       the relationship (sadly of course his death means that the  available
       evidence  from  him  cannot  be  improved  upon).  Furthermore,   the
       Tribunal's ultimate conclusion appeared to be that  the  relationship
       was less  strong  than  claimed,  rather  than  being  one  that  was
       concocted. However, it was difficult to see any basis  for  rejecting
       the clear evidence of both parties to the relationship, other than  a
       perceived lack of corroboration, that they  had  become  engaged.  It
       seemed to me that a rather firmer evidential basis  would  be  needed
       for doubting the fact of their engagement than this.

   20. The Immigration Rules give particular attention to whether or  not  a
       couple is engaged to be  married  in  the  entry  clearance  context,
       though not in the context of an application for leave to remain. This
       nevertheless demonstrates that there is a real  difference  drawn  by
       the executive and endorsed by Parliament via the negative  resolution
       procedure which  reviews  those  Rules  between  different  kinds  of
       relationship.

   21. Then there is the question of the Appellant's private  life  ties  in
       the UK. The Appellant entered the UK on 1  August  2002  aged  twelve
       years and eight months. He  made  his  application  for  leave  (when
       taking up the opportunity to submit grounds for leave in response  to
       a section 120 notice), on 8 September  2015,  aged  twenty  five  and
       eleven months. At that date he had lived in the UK for thirteen years
       and one month. He has accordingly lived for more than half  his  life
       in this country. Because his application was made at a time  when  he
       had reached his twenty-sixth year, he was excluded from  the  benefit
       of  Rule  276ADE(v),  though  of  course  he  had   previously   made
       applications seeking to regularise his status, including one in  July
       2012, around the time that that Rule first sought to encapsulate  the
       appropriate public policy response to the situation of a young person
       who had lived for much of their life in this country.

   22. As stated in MM (Lebanon) [2017] UKSC 10, "although the tribunal must
       make its own  judgment,  it  should  attach  considerable  weight  to
       judgments made by the Secretary of  State  in  the  exercise  of  her
       constitutional responsibility for immigration policy." Lord  Carnwath
       in the Supreme Court makes the same point in Patel  [2013]  UKSC  72,
       stating at [55] that "the balance drawn by the rules may be  relevant
       to the consideration of proportionality". So whilst it would be quite
       wrong to credit an individual with the fact they only just  miss  out
       on qualifying under a particular Rule, it is  important  to  identify
       whether their circumstances are such  ta  the  policy  considerations
       that the Rules generally promote are enlivened.

   23. The First-tier  Tribunal  concentrated  heavily  on  the  Appellant's
       assumed ties with Nigeria (whatever they might be  -  the  evidential
       basis for presuming such ties to be extant is very slight).  However,
       it did not have any tangible  regard  to  the  extent  to  which  the
       Appellant's circumstances equated to  a  position  where  in  general
       public policy is to regularise rather than deny  immigration  status.
       That policy position reflects the considerations identified in Maslov
       v Austria [2008] ECHR 546, which recognises that even for  a  foreign
       national offender, "the solidity of social, cultural and family  ties
       with the host country" must be contrasted and with those retained  in
       the country of origin.

   24. I accordingly found that the decision of the First-tier tribunal  was
       flawed by material errors of law. As the remaining issues essentially
       turned on proportionality, it was appropriate to  retain  the  matter
       for final determination in the Upper Tribunal.

  Continuation hearing - Proceedings

   25. The Appellant continued to  represent  himself  at  the  continuation
       hearing. No further documents  were  supplied.  He  and  his  partner
       Barbara gave evidence. He stated that his sister had now been granted
       a residence card which he understood recognised EEA residence rights.
       Barbara stated that she now earned �25,000  annually  (there  were  a
       number of payslips showing earnings exceeding �22,000 from the First-
       tier Tribunal proceedings, around a year ago).

   26. Ms Everett submitted that, notwithstanding  the  Appellant's  lengthy
       residence for nearly half his life, and his  attempts  to  regularise
       his status, he did not meet the letter of the Rules and thus  had  to
       show very significant obstacles to integration under the private life
       route or a compelling case outside the Rules. Given  his  immigration
       history, it would be proportionate for the Appellant to return abroad
       and make an  application  under  the  Rules,  because  there  was  no
       significant obstacle to him so doing.

   27. The Appellant submitted, on his own behalf, that his life was in this
       country, his fianc�e and niece were here, and now his sister had been
       granted a residence card; he felt his life would be incomplete if  he
       was unable to complete the mission  that  he  and  Harry  had  begun,
       building up youth capacity to stand up to gang life, he  knew  nobody
       there, and this was the only country he had known all his life.

  Continuation hearing - Findings and Reasons

   28. I accept that the Appellant and Sponsor have established family life.
       No aspect of their evidence was challenged by Ms Everett.  They  have
       now been together for some five years and they have been  engaged  to
       marry for well over  a  year.  Barbara  continues  to  stand  by  the
       Appellant notwithstanding that a further year has  passed  since  the
       First-tier  Tribunal  hearing,  and  will  have  inevitably  been   a
       significant source of emotional support to him during difficult times
       that have included the death of his closest friend. Although they  do
       not cohabit (I accept, for reasons of genuine personal  belief)  they
       are clearly devoted to one another. Their ties transcend a  temporary
       relationship of the kind that might sometimes  be  labelled  as  that
       between "boyfriend and girlfriend".

   29. Additionally of course the Appellant has  very  strong  private  life
       ties in the UK. He has lived here since the age  of  twelve,  an  age
       when the circumstances of his  entry  cannot  be  held  against  him.
       Although he has not lived in the UK for precisely half his  life,  he
       has lived for a very significant period, and in terms of that portion
       of his life which he can realistically be expected  to  remember,  it
       has been wholly in the UK, including the period  over  which  he  has
       made the kind of friendships that can be expected to endure and  over
       which time he has developed as a  young  adult.  He  has  very  close
       community ties as shown by the 7 Elohim project that he has  pursued,
       with his friend Harry and since the latter's demise  on  his  own.  I
       accept that in the circumstances the Appellant will see this  project
       as a very significant part of his own identity; it is a mission  that
       gives his life a central and meaningful purpose.

   30. In Niemietz v Germany [1992] ECHR 80 at  [29]  the  ECtHR  recognised
       that private life goes beyond one's "inner circle"  of  relationships
       without regard to the  "outside  world"  which  one  inhabits:  one's
       "private life must also comprise to a certain  degree  the  right  to
       establish and develop relationships with other human beings." As  was
       stated for example in Karako v  Hungary  39311/05  [2009]  ECHR  712,
       "'private life' includes personal identity (Von Hannover v.  Germany,
       no. 59320/00, � 50, ECHR 2004-VI). The Court  further  observes  that
       the Convention, as interpreted in the Von Hannover judgment regarding
       the individual's image, extends the protection of private life to the
       protection of personal integrity. This approach itself results from a
       broad interpretation of Article 8 to encompass  notions  of  personal
       integrity and the free development of the personality. It seems to me
       that the Appellant has developed very strong private life  ties  with
       the UK in this sense.

   31. Given the length and substance of the Appellant's  relationship  with
       his partner and the strength of his UK ties, I accept his private and
       family life would be the subject of serious interference were  he  to
       have to depart the UK.

   32. That leaves the question of  proportionality.  Of  course  there  are
       negative factors here. The  Appellant  has  overstayed  his  original
       leave to enter the UK by a very significant period, and  he  has  not
       succeeded in regularising his status as an adult. He poses some  risk
       of being a burden on  public  funds  as  he  has  no  lengthy  lawful
       employment history. He does not qualify for the  private  life  route
       given that his qualifications would make it difficult for him to show
       that he faced very significant obstacles to  integration  in  Nigeria
       and he has not lived in the UK for half his life.

   33.  However,  these  factors  are  to  my  mind  outweighed   by   other
       considerations,  including  the  statutory  criteria  identified   in
       section 117B of the Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002:

        a) He has a very strong combination of private and family life ties
           in the UK;

        b) His partner does important work for the community;

        c) He speaks fluent English and has  strong  prospects  of  finding
           work in the future and thus  achieving  financial  independence,
           given he has  already  supported  himself  without  recourse  to
           public funds for an extended period;

        d) He has lived in the UK for a  very  significant  period,  almost
           half  his  life,  and  has  repeatedly  sought  to  engage  with
           immigration control  by  making  applications  with  a  view  to
           regularising his status;

        e) He cannot reasonably be presumed to have  any  real  connections
           left  in  Nigeria;   his   evidence   denying   connections   is
           uncontroverted, he left before he would have developed the  kind
           of friendships that might reasonably be expected to endure,  and
           any family links must be extremely attenuated given that he  has
           been in the UK for well over a decade.

   34. Of course, his private life was established  on  a  precarious  basis
       given he has never held  indefinite  leave  to  remain.  In  Rhuppiah
       [2016] EWCA Civ 803 �45, Sales LJ noted that "the starting point  for
       consideration of the proper construction of Part 5A of the  2002  Act
       is that sections 117A-117D, taken together, are intended  to  provide
       for a structured approach to  the  application  of  Article  8  which
       produces in all cases a final result which is  compatible  with,  and
       not in violation of,  Article  8";  and  �53  "Although  a  court  or
       tribunal should have regard to the consideration that  little  weight
       should be given  to  private  life  established  in  [the  specified]
       circumstances, it is possible without violence to the language to say
       that such generalised normative guidance  may  be  overridden  in  an
       exceptional case by particularly strong features of the private  life
       in question ..." That  thinking  was  subsequently  endorsed  by  the
       Supreme  Court  in  Rhuppiah  [2018]  UKSC  58   �36,   �42-44,   and
       particularly �49), accepting that cases which are compelling  outside
       the Rules and must be approached via the "need for a degree, no doubt
       limited, of flexibility in the application of Part  5A  of  the  2002
       Act" Rhuppiah �42. It seems to  me  that  the  flexibility  that  the
       legislation requires demands  recognition  of  the  strength  of  the
       private life ties here.

   35. Decisions such as Chikwamba, Hayat [2012]  EWCA  Civ  1054  and  Chen
       (IJR) [2015] UKUT 189 (IAC) all demonstrate that there needs to be  a
       "sensible reason" for separating family members;  this  principle  is
       not necessarily limited to scenarios involving  children  but  to  my
       mind reasonably extends to the  circumstances  of  partners  who  are
       emotionally very close simply to ensure compliance  with  the  normal
       procedures. Indeed Sales LJ in Agyarko considered  this  scenario  at
       [31]:

           "It is possible to envisage a Chikwamba  type  case  arising  in
           which Article 8 might require that leave to  remain  be  granted
           outside the Rules, even though it could not be said  that  there
           were insurmountable obstacles to the applicant and their  spouse
           or partner continuing their family life overseas. But in a  case
           involving precarious family  life,  it  would  be  necessary  to
           establish that there were exceptional circumstances  to  warrant
           such a conclusion."

   36. This is further explained by Hickinbottom LJ in Tikka [2018] EWCA Civ
       642 �25-26:

           "The Secretary of State has already considered her discretion in
           that regard, and determined that the Appellant should not remain
           in the United Kingdom. There is no reason to  suppose  that,  on
           the same material and  applying  the  same  criteria,  an  Entry
           Clearance Officer on her behalf will come to a  different  view;
           indeed, there is every reason to consider that he will  come  to
           the same view. That refusal will be the  subject  of  an  appeal
           that will raise exactly the same issues as  the  appeal  to  the
           tribunal in this case, i.e. whether the  interference  with  the
           article 8 rights of the Appellant and his wife that a  permanent
           separation  would  entail  is  justified  ...  That   ...   only
           underscores the  futility  of  removing  the  Appellant  without
           determining, once and for all, the underlying  article  8  issue
           ..."

   37. There is evidence that the Sponsor earns a salary  that  exceeds  the
       amount required by the Rules endorsed  by  Parliament.  I  appreciate
       that that evidence does not meet every aspect of the  Appendix  FM-SE
       strictures; but the  credibility  of  the  Sponsor's  occupation  and
       earnings stands unchallenged, and her work  as  a  radiographer  will
       clearly be in demand for the foreseeable future. She has spent over a
       year in the same role and it would seem that if anything her earnings
       (her evidence on the point again  having  been  unchallenged  by  the
       Respondent) have increased since the First-tier Tribunal hearing.  So
       I accept that the policy objectives which the Rules  serve  are  here
       satisfied.

   38. I cannot detect any sensible reason to expect the Appellant to return
       abroad and seek entry clearance as suggested by Ms Everett. Were  his
       partner to feel obliged to accompany him, that would require  her  to
       live in a country  where  she  has  no  links  (she  is  of  Ghanaian
       heritage) and  would  interrupt  the  important  public  service  she
       provides in the UK.  To  demand  the  Appellant's  departure  for  an
       uncertain period would simply interrupt his work  for  the  7  Elohim
       project, which I accept has some value to the community, and postpone
       the date at which he can begin to make more of a contribution  to  UK
       society by finding  durable  employment.  Ms  Everett  identified  no
       difference in the  likely  criteria  against  which  a  future  entry
       clearance application would  be  assessed  than  were  already  found
       within the decision already made refusing his application that led to
       the instant appeal. In these circumstances it seems to  me  that  the
       reasoning in Tikka applies, and that it would be futile to expect the
       Appellant to have to re-argue the same case in the future as  he  has
       already put in the present proceedings. In any event, it is difficult
       to see that the public policy in discouraging entry clearance  queue-
       jumping is  threatened  in  circumstances  where  the  Appellant  was
       brought to the UK as a minor under the control of adults.

   39. Overall I find  the  Appellant's  departure  from  the  UK  would  be
       disproportionate to the public interest it aims to serve.

  Decision:

  The appeal is allowed.
