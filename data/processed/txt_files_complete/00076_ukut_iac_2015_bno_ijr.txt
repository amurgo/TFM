Introduction


JUDGE GOLDSTEIN: The applicant brings an application for judicial review  of
    the Respondent's decision dated 2 June 2014 to refuse  the  applicant's
    claim for asylum and to certify the  claim  under  Section  94  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  and  following  removal
    directions set on 11 June 2014 for the applicant's removal.


2.       As the removal directions were subsequently cancelled this part  of
    the applicant's claim is entirely academic.


3.       The Respondent submitted an acknowledgement  of  service  dated  31
    July 2014 together with a decision letter dated 25 July 2014  in  which
    she withdrew the original decision.  The  July  letter  was  issued  in
    order to give further consideration to the applicant's Article 8  claim
    as well as to consider the country of origin information and the  claim
    of the applicant, a citizen  of  India  born  on  30  June  1988,  that
    internal relocation was not possible for her as a lone woman.


4.       It  follows  that  any  criticism  of  the  June  decision  is  now
    academic, it having been superseded by the Respondent's decision letter
    of 31 July 2014.  No challenge has been made to the Respondent's  later
    decision and no application has been made to amend the grounds to  seek
    a review of that later decision.


5.       Permission to bring these proceedings  was  granted  on  15  August
    2014 by Upper Tribunal Judge Storey on the basis that the grounds  were
    arguable as the Respondent appeared  to  have  withdrawn  the  decision
    challenged in the judicial review application  and  that  by  so  doing
    without adequate explanation, it "cast doubt on the  original  decision
    to certify".


6.       However, this being a challenge to the decision of 2 June 2014  and
    for the reasons I have stated above, it  follows  that  the  subsequent
    decision of the Respondent in July 2014 renders these  judicial  review
    proceedings academic.


7.       At the outset of the hearing before me on  28  January  2015  there
    was no appearance on the part of the applicant, no explanation for  her
    absence and no request for an adjournment.


8.       It is apparent that at the time of the applicant's judicial  review
    application lodged with the Tribunal on 7 July 2014, thus predating the
    Respondent's subsequent July decision, she was detained and  thus  gave
    her address as that  of  Yarl's  Wood  Immigration  Removal  Centre  in
    Bedford and the address to which documents should be sent, as  that  of
    her solicitors' Messrs Carter Young.


9.       I was  satisfied  that  notice  of  hearing  was  served  upon  her
    solicitors' address who had acknowledged receipt of the notice and  had
    since been given leave to withdraw from the record.


10.      By letter dated 21 January 2015 and in response to  the  Tribunal's
    request as to whether or not they had been able to inform the applicant
    at the date of hearing, Messrs Carter Young informed the Tribunal  that
    save for the details produced within their application to come off  the
    record regarding their attempts to contact the applicant, they had  not
    been successful in informing her of the date of hearing.


11.      The Treasury Solicitor by letter to the Tribunal dated  21  January
    2015 had attached her Statement of Costs and explained that  since  the
    grant of Carter Young Solicitors' request to be taken  off  the  record
    she had not sent a copy to the applicant as she was without her current
    forwarding address.


12.      I further noted from the Respondent's skeleton  argument  dated  16
    January 2015, that the applicant was subject to  reporting  obligations
    that required her to sign on with the Respondent every week.   However,
    on 8 December 2014 she failed to attend and appears to have  absconded,
    thus remaining in violation of her obligations ever since.


13.      Further the Respondent wrote a letter to  the  applicant  dated  12
    December 2014 at an address in Newcastle in  which  the  applicant  was
    asked to confirm that the address was correct, in which  case  detailed
    grounds would be served upon her at that address.   The  applicant  was
    also invited to obtain further legal advice.


14.      The Respondent stated that the applicant  did  not  reply  to  this
    letter notwithstanding the Respondent's further effort to  contact  the
    applicant by letter dated 14 January 2015 that also failed to meet with
    a response.


15.      In that the applicant, without explanation, is  not  present  today
    to pursue her claim and in light of my reasons above I dismiss it.


Decision


16.      For the above reasons this claim for judicial review is dismissed.


Costs


17.      For like reason I grant to the Respondent her application that  the
    applicant be ordered to pay her  costs  of  resisting  the  claim  that
    includes the drafting of detailed grounds of response and attending the
    hearing.


18.      There is before  me  a  schedule  of  the  costs  prepared  by  the
    Respondent that for the understandable reasons to which  I  have  above
    referred has not been served upon the applicant.


19.      I note that there is no application made by the applicant  for  the
    costs of issuing the original judicial review proceedings.


20.      I have decided to grant the Respondent her  costs  in  the  sum  of
    ï¿½5,244.








Permission to Appeal


21.      There being no arguable basis to appeal,  I  refuse  permission  to
    appeal to the Court of Appeal. ~~~~0~~~~
