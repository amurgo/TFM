                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The Appellant, a national of Sri Lanka, date of birth 11 October  1986,
    appealed against the Respondent's decision of 20 May 2015 to refuse  an
    application for leave to remain by reference to the Immigration  Rules.
    The Appellant appealed by reference to Article 8 ECHR and, at a hearing
    before First-tier Tribunal Judge A  Kelly  (the  judge),  evidence  was
    adduced concerning the role that the Appellant played in  the  care  of
    her sister and brother-in-law and the subsequent part she had played in
    the  upbringing  of  their  children.   Her   appeal   was   dismissed.
    Permission to appeal was given and on 25 May 2017 I  decided  that  the
    original Tribunal had failed to properly address Section 55  BCIA  2009
    and give reasons why the claim did not succeed under Article 8 ECHR  in
    terms of the proportionality of the Original Tribunal's decision.

2.   I gave directions for a resumed hearing which took  place  on  18  July
    2017.  At the hearing evidence was called from the  Appellant  and  her
    sister, [NJ].

3.   The evidence was tested in  cross-examination  by  Mr  Bramble.   In  a
    nutshell the Appellant's case is that she came to the United Kingdom as
    a student and, in circumstances  that  are  fully  particularised,  she
    stayed to look after NJ, with whom she is  very  close  in  any  event,
    during her sister's pregnancy with her first child.  Also at the  time,
    having married in June 2009, NJ learned in 2010 that  her  husband  was
    terminally ill with cancer.  In the circumstances NJ  had  become  very
    weak and needed moral and  physical  support  during  the  end  of  the
    pregnancy and with the new-born child.   The  Appellant  describes  the
    relationship she developed with the child while NJ had concentrated  on
    the care of her husband (KJ).

4.   The position was that KJ was bedridden and the  sister  was  unable  to
    take care  of  herself,  the  baby's  needs  and  him.   The  situation
    significantly deteriorated after the child  was  born.   The  Appellant
    therefore was looking after the children, [JJ] (date of birth [ ] 2010)
    and [EJ] (date of birth [ ] 2014)

5.   The Appellant's bundle contains copious evidence  of  the  ailments  of
    (KJ) and the problems that he faced together with his death certificate
    in the name of [KJ] (date of death [ ] 2016).

6.   It is  clear  also  that  the  NJ  not  only  had  a  relevant  medical
    condition, being a blood clot on the lungs, but  she  also  during  her
    pregnancy  with  the  second  child  started  to  undergo  tonic-clonic
    seizures and manifesting signs of epilepsy.  The contemporary  evidence
    showed of the Appellant caring for NJ, KJ while he  was  bedridden  and
    taking nearly complete care of the children.

7.   After the death of KJ the Appellant, whilst NJ was  undergoing  medical
    treatment, was essentially the primary carer of the two children.

8.   The evidence from St. Bartholomew's Hospital confirms  the  illness  of
    KJ and other medical evidence confirms the ill-health of the NJ and the
    need she had for care as well as the Appellant looking  after  the  two
    children and providing a stable home for  them.   It  is  to  a  degree
    unsurprising that at least the eldest child and  probably  the  younger
    were aware of the death  of  their  father  with  the  disturbance  and
    disruption it caused, not least in terms of its effect  upon  NJ.   The
    evidence is therefore that the seizures which NJ had began in 2013  and
    progressed into 2014.

9.   Whilst the NJ eventually  received  medication  to  try  to  limit  the
    number of epileptic attacks, the position was that  they  continued  in
    2015 and 2016.  It appears that there were certainly three and possibly
    four such attacks relating to the period before the  death  of  KJ  and
    thereafter.  It also is again recorded that in  March  2017  NJ  had  a
    further epileptic attack in church.   The  experience  of  the  seizure
    leaves her at risk of hurting herself when she falls  and  blacks  out.
    She really has no idea what is going on around her.   Given  the  young
    age of the children, the significance of  these  attacks  is  not  only
    concerning to any adult but particularly concerning  to  the  Appellant
    who has such a close  relationship  with  both  the  children  and  her
    sister.  It is said that generalised tonic-clonic seizures carry a risk
    of serious injury, mortality and morbidity and sudep (Sudden Unexpected
    Death in Epilepsy).

10.  The epilepsy clinic, as well as the  GP,  confirms  NJ's  problems  and
    there is no prognosis to suggest that there is any  likelihood  of  the
    problem going away.  The attack in March 2017 may have occurred because
    the NJ forgot to take her medication, but that is by no means  certain,
    might be the cause of the most recent attack.  The  evidence  from  the
    eldest child, [S], that the Appellant is playing an active part in  her
    going to school, managing the processed case.  It is  also  clear  that
    the Appellant will play a similar part when the second child, [EJ],  is
    attending  school.   There  was  no  challenge  to  the  claimed   deep
    relationship between the Appellant and the  two  children  nor  of  the
    relationship the Appellant has with her sister.

11.  The Appellant and NJ have no other family in the United  Kingdom.   The
    Appellant's parents have rights to remain in Italy but are not  Italian
    nationals.  They have no rights to enter the United Kingdom to  play  a
    part in the care of the children.

12.  One of the features of the problems the NJ faces is that  the  seizures
    can be precipitated  by  lifestyle,  stress  and  anxiety  raising  the
    threshold.  It is clear that there is, as it  is  put,  some  level  of
    supervision of NJ by the Appellant  particularly  when  the  former  is
    cooking and bathing to ensure her safety if  she did have a seizure  at
    that time.  The medical evidence, particularly from the 'epilepsy nurse
    specialist', is that it is important for the stability of the  children
    and her sister and NJ's safety that the  Appellant  remains  with  her.
    This correspondence has been disclosed to the Respondent and there  has
    been no substantive response to that analysis.

13.  In addition Pastor Kamalendran from  the  Newbury  Park  Tamil  Church,
    part of the Emmanuel  Christian  Fellowship,  confirmed  the  role  the
    Appellant plays in the church together with her involvement  in  church
    activities and assisting NJ.  There was confirmation of  the  epileptic
    fit on 12 March 2017 at the church at which the Appellant was "...  the
    only person who was able to attend to her sister, which  would  be  the
    case in domestic environment."  St Bede's Catholic Primary  School  and
    Nursery wrote concerning the Appellant

         "The above-named person is reported by school staff to  be  heavily
         involved in [J]'s life ([JJ]) currently a pupil at  St  Bede's  ...
         She picks the child up from school and supports mum heavily  during
         the passing of Jane's father.  Mum presents a strong case to school
         that Miss [C]'s continued involvement  with  the  family  is  of  a
         pivotal nature."

14.  The letter dated 31 March 2017 is from the  headteacher  Mr  Nott.   NJ
    made a statutory declaration, sworn before a solicitor on 21 July 2016,
    making the Appellant the legal  guardian  of  both  children  with  the
    necessary powers to act in caring for the children.  That document does
    not determine the role played by the  Appellant  but  it  is  certainly
    consistent with the evidence of the role and responsibility engaged  in
    by the Appellant.

15.  The Appellant's immigration history is set out in  her  statement.   In
    particular it is clear that  the  Appellant  had  been  in  the  United
    Kingdom for a number of years before returning to  Italy  in  or  about
    2003.  The Appellant came to the UK as a student and was given leave to
    remain which expired in October 2008.   An  application  was  made  for
    further leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  4  (General)  Student  but  the
    application was refused because the intended course to be followed  was
    at the Cambridge College, a college subsequently brought into disrepute
    for other reasons.  The decision was sent to her on that application on
    26 January  2009  and  the  Appellant  took  advice  from  an  approved
    immigration adviser who made an application to vary leave to remain  as
    a student.  The Appellant thought an application  was  made,  the  fees
    were paid, and the Appellant was  informed  by  the  adviser  that  the
    application had been  lodged.   Whilst  waiting  for  the  Respondent's
    decision, the Appellant was unable to renew  her  leave  to  remain  in
    Italy as her solicitors informed her that her  passport  was  with  the
    Home Office in relation to the Tier 4 application.

16.  At the same time her mother,  brother  and  father  obtained  permanent
    residence in Italy.  The Appellant chased the application that had been
    made, contact was made with the Home Office and it was learned that  no
    application had actually been made despite the fee having  been  taken.
    The position therefore was that by 2009 the Appellant had no  basis  to
    remain.   The  Appellant  through   other   representatives   made   an
    application for further  leave  to  remain  outside  of  the  Rules  on
    compassionate  and  discretionary  grounds  on  1  March   2010.    The
    application was rejected on 10 March 2010.   The  Appellant  says  that
    with that rejection she decided to leave the UK but could not  relocate
    to Italy and had difficulties in going back to Sri  Lanka  on  her  own
    when her parents and entire family were in Italy.  During  this  period
    the Appellant became aware of KJ's illness and  diagnosis  and  so  she
    stayed on, as recited above, to assist her sister who had  the  general
    care along with the young child and the fact she was pregnant.  In  the
    circumstances it is said that the Appellant was not playing or  abusing
    the immigration system but that events ultimately intervened.

17.  Further representations were  made  and  those  were  refused  and  the
    position was that the Appellant was requested by KJ to care for NJ  and
    their child.  With the death of KJ, NJ went into deep  depression,  was
    unable to deal with their children, fell ill and  her  epilepsy  became
    more difficult to manage.

18.  NJ's evidence essentially  recites  the  same  description  of  events,
    along with  far  more  detailed  material  concerning  her  health  and
    personal problems in dealing with the death of KJ and the  delivery  of
    the second child together with the onset of pulmonary problems and  the
    epilepsy.

19.  There was no substantive challenge to the medical history or  the  role
    that the Appellant has played in the personal care of NJ  and  the  two
    children.  The position therefore is that the Appellant has developed a
    very close relationship much as if she was the mother of  the  children
    and continues to play such a role.  NJ says that she has  a  continuing
    need for her sister to be present in the UK, as do  her  children  with
    whom she has such a close relationship.  It appears that the  household
    sleeping arrangements, care arrangements including  bathing,  dressing,
    preparing meals, dropping the  children  off  for  school  or  nursery,
    collecting them and managing their daily lives falls almost entirely on
    the Appellant.

20.  I formed the view that these personal circumstances and best  interests
    of the children, who are British nationals and cannot  be  required  to
    leave the United Kingdom, fall to be considered  as  exceptional  under
    Article 8 outside of the Immigration Rules.

21.  The onset of illnesses of NJ, together with  the  requirements  of  the
    children and the role the Appellant  plays  are  important  factors  in
    assessing the children's best interests.  It  is  quite  apparent  that
    simply being able to obtain social care from  Social  Services  is  not
    akin to what the children have become, through events, used to.

22.  There  is  no  suggestion  that  the  Appellant  has  been  financially
    dependent on the state.  Indeed I was told  on  instructions  that  she
    receives some �300-�400 a month by way of maintenance from her  parents
    in Italy.

23.  It is clear the Appellant speaks reasonable English and that chimes  in
    with the involvement she plays in the upbringing of the children.

24.  It is true to say that her immigration history is poor but I take  into
    account the efforts that she did make, confirmed by NJ as  a  fact,  of
    the role she played in seeking to  regularise  her  situation  and  the
    circumstances in which it came to pass that she simply stayed on.  This
    is not a case simply of the cost and practical implications  of  social
    care.  This is the involvement the Appellant has, in effect as a mother
    of the children, and the active role she has  played  now  for  several
    years.

25.  I consider these  circumstances  are  exceptional  and  compelling  and
    there was no argument that essentially, if this matter is to be  looked
    at outside of the Rules  as  it  seems  the  judge  did,  although  his
    reasoning is less than a model of  clarity,  that  the  evidence  shows
    assessing all the evidence in the round that the first  four  questions
    posed by the decision in Razgar [2004] UKHL  27  are  answered  in  the
    affirmative.  In considering  this  matter  I  have  fully  taken  into
    account Sections 117A and 117B of the NIAA 2002 particularly the public
    interest.

26.  I reach the conclusion that, even though NJ's leave to  remain  is  due
    to expire in November 2017, the position is that with British  national
    children the near certainty is that she will apply for a further period
    of leave and, there being no contrary arguments by the parties, she  is
    likely to obtain a renewal and to continue within the United Kingdom.

27.  I therefore find, having regard to the  considerations  of  the  public
    interest, to which I attach great weight, this  is  a  case  where  the
    interests of the British national children clearly outweigh the  public
    interest.  There is nothing to gainsay their best interests lie in  the
    Appellant's daily presence in their life for some years to come.  I  do
    not agree with the Rule 24 response of the Secretary of  State  to  the
    effect that it was in the children's best interests to learn  to  adapt
    to life without her.  It does not seem to me  that  that  is  a  proper
    consideration of their best interests. I find the Respondent's decision
    is disproportionate and outwith the interests of British nationals  and
    the public interest.

DECISION

The appeal should be allowed under Article 8 ECHR.

ANONYMITY ORDER

In view of the age of the children I have considered  whether  an  anonymity
order was necessary.  None was sought and I do not find one is  required  in
the circumstances of the case.

FEE AWARD

This appeal has succeeded on the weight of evidence in  far  greater  detail
than was before the Secretary of State and in the  circumstances  I  do  not
find a fee award is appropriate.
