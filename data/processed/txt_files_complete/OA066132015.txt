                                                                   Appellant

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr S E Unigwe
For the Respondent:    Mr S Kotas


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   This  is  the  remaking  of  the  appeal  of  Mr  Spencer  against  the
    respondent's decision of 5 February 2015 refusing him  entry  clearance
    as a partner under Appendix FM paragraph EC-P.1.1.

2.   At a hearing on 6 February  2017  I  found  an  error  of  law  in  the
    decision  of  the  First-tier  Judge  who  had  previously  allowed  Mr
    Spencer's appeal, the problem being that Mr Spencer  had  not  produced
    bank statements in compliance with the requirements of  the  Rules.   I
    was lacking the personal bank statements corresponding to the period of
    the pay slips at paragraph 2(a) showing that the salary had  been  paid
    into an account in the name of the person or in the name of the  person
    and their partner jointly.

3.   At the hearing before me today were produced bank statements which,  it
    was common ground, corresponded with the requirements of the Rules.

4.   The appeal of Mr Spencer is accordingly allowed.

5.   No anonymity direction is made.
