Representation:

For the Appellant: Mr Smart - Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.

For the Respondent: Mr Fripp instructed by Braitch RB Solicitors.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


     1. On 10th May 2013 it was  found  that  a  panel  of  the  First-tier
        Tribunal, composed of First-tier Tribunal Judge Gurung-Thapa and Mr
        M James (NLM), had materially erred in law  in  their  decision  to
        allow DNH's appeal against the order for his deportation  from  the
        United Kingdom. The reasons are set out in the Error of Law Finding
        dated 13th May 2013. The determination was  set  aside  with  there
        being preserved findings as follows:


     30.  The respondent in their notice of decision (CC3-CC11) accepts that
              the appellant has established a family life in the UK with his
   wife            and  children.  The  respondent  also  accepts  that  the
   appellant has           lived in the UK since 20th September 2000 and has
   established a                private life by  virtue  of  his  length  of
   residence.  Even if it was not            accepted by the respondent that
   the appellant has established private              life with his wife and
   children, we would have had no hesitation in           finding  that  the
   appellant has established a  family  life  with  his  wife            and
   children for the following reasons.


     31.  We have had the benefit of hearing evidence from the appellant and
              the witnesses. We find that there  was  consistency  in  their
   evidence            and there was no hint of exaggeration whatsoever.  We
   find the                appellant and all the witnesses to be credible.


     32.  We find that the appellant's return after such a  long  period  of
          residence and  his  family  life  would  have  sufficiently  grave
     consequences to engage the operation of Article 8 (2).   We  find  that
     the decision is in accordance with the law and that it is necessary  in
          the interests of  the  economic  well-being  of  the  country  the
          furtherance of immigration control.


     2. I comment at this stage that the legitimate aim  is  not  just  the
        economic well-being of the United Kingdom as this is a  deportation
        case which therefore involves the additional legitimate aim of  the
        protection of society against serious criminals as acknowledged  in
        JO (Uganda) [2010] EWCA Civ 10.



Background


     3. DNH was born on 26th September 1975 and is a citizen of Jamaica. On
        31st May 2012 the Secretary  of  State  made  a  deportation  order
        against him under the provisions of section 32 (5) UK  Borders  Act
        2007 as a result of his  conviction,  on  12th  September  2006  at
        Wolverhampton Crown Court, for the offences of s. 18  Wounding with
        intent and possessing an offensive  weapon.  He  was  found  guilty
        after trial on both counts.


     4. In his sentencing remarks HHJ Challinor stated:


              [DH], you have been convicted of  a  serious  offence,  namely
   wounding with           intent, as defined by section 224 of the Criminal
   Justice Act 2003 and I regret to              have to tell you that I  am
   fully  satisfied  that  there  is  in  your  case  a   significant   risk
   to members of the public of serious harm occasioned by the commission  by
   you            of further specific offences, namely offences of  violence
   to the person using a            weapon. In coming to that  conclusion  I
   look to section 229 of the Act and I am            sorry  to  be  quoting
   provisions at you, but I will  try  and  make  it  as  clear  as  I  can.
   In that section I consider the   following matters:
               First  of  all,  this  offence,  it  was  largely,  I   find,
   unprovoked.  You  barged  into               someone  in  a  queue.  When
   restrained you pulled out a knife. The chilling  aspect                of
   the case was the speed with which you deployed that weapon. The  evidence
          made it plain that it came out of your pocket like a flash. It was
   a knife designed             to expose the blade by some sort  of  spring
   mechanism and then you began to           stab repeatedly at Mr  Ali  who
   of course was unarmed.  His heavy jacket saved              him from more
   serious  injury  but  the  two  stabs  that  penetrated  his  body   were
   both serious; but one nicked his liver. It was on any  view  a  ferocious
   and                 potentially lethal attack.


              This offence was committed against the background of a pattern
   of previous             offending.  I  accept  that  it  is  not  serious
   previous offending but it involves                 violence in public and
   very   worryingly   includes    a    conviction    for    possessing    a
   bladed article.


              I am satisfied that you are a man who hitherto has  habitually
   carried knives to            use in response to  even  trivial  disputes,
   and why that should be I do not know. It           is hinted  at  in  the
   report which speaks  of  you  being  the  subject  of  a  serious  attack
   yourself when you were 17 and it may be that  you  have  been  inculcated
   into a              culture of knife carrying people.  But that being the
   case, it seems to me that  you              fit  the  criteria  of  being
   dangerous as I have defined it.


              The presentence report secondly,  assesses  the  risk  to  the
   public from you as being              high. The psychiatric  report  from
   Dr  Stafford  shows  you  have  little  insight  into                your
   offending and his opinion is that this could indicate a greater chance of
              offending in the future and your pattern of  offending  during
   the last three years             could indicate future offending.


              I have also  of  course  considered  the  mitigation.  I  have
   listened with care to what            has been said ably on  your  behalf
   by Ms Thomas.  I have read the letter of  Moses               White,  the
   letter from your partner, [LU].  I note you  have  young  children;  that
     there is nothing to suggest that you are anything  other  than  a  good
   father and a            good husband and one  of  your  children  is  not
   well. But I am afraid sympathy to             you  and  your  family  and
   dependants must take second place to my duty to              protect  the
   public. The purpose of  the  sentence  that  I  impose  upon  you  is  to
   protect the public.


              In my view, the tariff sentence, that is to  say,  the  normal
   sentence of                      imprisonment which would be  appropriate
   for  this  offence  after  a  trial,  would  be             seven   years
   imprisonment. I make it plain that because of the delay  in  sentence  in
     this case, which has been very hard view to bear, I reduce that  tariff
   sentence to             one of six years. You have spent  six  months  in
   custody; I shall give you credit for          that in this  way.  I  half
   the  six  year  sentence  to  three  years;  I  give   you   credit   for
   the six months already served, making a two and  a  half  year  custodial
   element.


              The sentence is therefore this, for the wounding with  intent,
   there will be a                   sentence  of  imprisonment  for  public
   protection. The minimum period  that  you             have  to  serve  in
   custody, from  today,  is  two  and  a  half  years.  You  will  then  be
   eligible for release on parole licence, assuming that you are judged safe
   to be          released. Thereafter you will remain on  licence  for  the
   rest of your life, unless             after a period  of  10  years  from
   today you are  deemed  suitable  to  have  your                   license
   revoked.


     5. DNH has an established  family  and  private  life  in  the  United
        Kingdom as recognised by Judge Challinor.  His evidence is that  he
        has lived in this country, with only a single  short  break,  since
        late September 1999.  He  is  here  lawfully  having  been  granted
        Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) on 19th  September  2001  and  has
        been in a  relationship  with  the  person  who  is  now  his  wife
        (hereinafter referred to as 'his  wife'  or  'L  U-H'),  a  British
        citizen, since the year 2000. The couple have three children:


              PU-H - born 23rd July 2001


              DU-H - born 21st February 2003


              Z U-H - born 26th May 2013.


     6. Mr Smart has provided a more  detailed  immigration  history  which
        puts the above into its proper context:


          8 September 1999          DNH enters the  United  Kingdom.  He  is
   granted                               leave to enter  until  7th  October
   1999.


           3  October  1999             DNH's  representatives   submit   an
   application on his                            behalf for an extension  of
   stay on the basis  of                                    marriage  to  LM
   which took place on 15th September                              1999.


          20 July 2000              DNH served with a notice of liability to
   removal  as                                 an  illegal  entrant  as   he
   employed  a  verbal  deception                             to  enter  the
   United Kingdom.


          4th August 2000       Removal directions set for 4th August  2000,
   however                               DNH purchased his  own  ticket  and
   leaves  the                                     United  Kingdom  on   1st
   August 2000.


          August/September 2000     DNH applied for and  was  granted  entry
   clearance  as                               the  spouse  of   a   British
   citizen. He was issued with  a                                visa  valid
   from     the     8th     September      2000      to      11th      March
   2001.


          20 September 2000         DNH re-entered the United Kingdom.


          19 September 2001         Application made for ILR on the basis of
   marriage.                             Granted on 20th September 2001.


          23 July 2003          DNH convicted at Walsall  Magistrates  Court
   of                                    using  a  license  with  intent  to
   deceive and fined �75.


          2 September 2003       DNH  convicted  at  Birmingham  Magistrates
   Court  of                               using  disorderly  behaviour   or
                                      threatening/abusive/insulting    words
   likely  to  cause                                harassment,   alarm   or
   distress and was fined �100.


          24 September 2003         DNH convicted at Birmingham  Magistrates
   Court of                              having an article with a blade in a
   public place. Fine                            �100.


           15  March  2005              DNH  submitted  an  application  for
   naturalisation.


          16 March 2005             DNH convicted of being in  charge  of  a
   motor vehicle                             with excess alcohol at Aldridge
   and  Brownhills                                      Magistrate's  Court.
   Fine �150 and disqualified from                              driving  for
   12 months.


          17 May 2005           Naturalisation application  refused  due  to
   criminal                              convictions.


          12 September 2006         DNH  convicted  at  Wolverhampton  Crown
   Court of                              wounding with intent and having  an
   offensive                                   weapon.   Sentenced   to   an
   indeterminate sentence of                               imprisonment  for
   public protection under section                             225  Criminal
   Justice Act 2003, with a minimum  term                                 of
   30    months    to     be     served     before     consideration     for
   release. No appeal against conviction or sentence.


          29 April 2008             DNH divorced L M.


          11 November 2008          DNH served with a notice of liability to
   automatic                             deportation.


           17  February  2009           Deportation  order  signed  and  DNH
   advised. In light                             of his wish  to  return  to
   Jamaica it is accepted he did                               not  wish  to
   raise any exceptions under section 33 of                              the
   UK   Borders   Act   2007    and    so    was    given    an    out    of
   country right of appeal.


          2 March 2009              Appeal against  deportation  order  made
   from  within                                the  United  Kingdom.  Appeal
   rejected  by  First-tier                              Tribunal   on   the
   grounds of jurisdiction although  the                             grounds
   raised     were     considered     in     light     of     section     32
   (5) UK Borders Act 2007.


          5 May 2010            DNH marries L U-H.


          29  May  2012            Deportation  order  signed  on  the  17th
   February 2009                             revoked as it was applicable to
   decisions  attracting                                an  out  of  country
   appeal only.  A fresh deportation                               order was
   signed on 31st May 2012.


          30 July 2012          Appeal hearing at Stoke Hearing Centre  when
   the                              First-tier Tribunal allowed the appeal.


          10 May 2013           Upper Tribunal hearing at Birmingham Sheldon
                                Court finds error of law.


     7. The substantive question for the  Upper  Tribunal  remains  whether
        DNH's deportation  will  represent  a  disproportionate  breach  of
        Article  8  of  the  European  Convention  on  Human   Rights   and
        Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR).




Preliminary issue


     8. Mr Fripp raised as a  preliminary  issue  the  application  of  the
        changes to the Rules  to  this  case.  He  submitted  they  had  no
        application and relied upon the decision in MF  (Article  8  -  new
        rules) Nigeria [2012] UKUT 00393(IAC) in support of his proposition
        they have no application in light of the  fact  that  the  decision
        under appeal was taken prior to the amendments to  the  Immigration
        Rules which came into force on 9th July 2012. In  relation  to  the
        issue of retrospectivity the Tribunal stated:


              Retrospectivity

              58. Mr Ahluwalia urged us to find that the provisions  of  the
new rules relating                  to deportation, A362 in particular,  are
inapplicable  to  the  appellant's  appeal                 because  (i)  the
deportation   order   was   signed   almost   two    years    ago,    before
any plans were made for the introduction of the new rules; (ii)  a  fortiori
the               reasons for refusal letter makes no reference to  the  new
criteria; (iii) there               has been  no  new  reasons  for  refusal
letter by  the  respondent;  (iv)  "it  seems                   particularly
unfair that  A  is  subjected  to  the  new  rules  given  that  his  appeal
     was heard 18 months ago on 24.1.2011" and that, had the FtT  not  erred
in                law, then his appeal would have been dealt with under  the
old rules.

              59.      We do not find the arguments on this  issue  all  one
way.  In Odelola (FC)               (Appellant) v  Secretary  of  State  for
the Home Department (Respondent) [2009]                    UKHL  25  it  was
held  that,   unless   specified   to   the   contrary,   changes   in   the
immigration rules "take effect whenever they say they  take  effect."  (Lord
              Brown paragraph 39, see also  Lord  Hope,  paragraph  7);  see
also R (on  the                   application  of  Munir  and  Anor)  v  the
Secretary of State for the Home Department                 [2012]  UKSC  32.
Even   though   their   Lordships   in   Odelola   were   not   agreed    as
to whether the common law presumption  against  retrospectivity  applied  to
              the immigration rules, all agreed that the central  issue  was
the fairness of                 retroactive  changes,  and  that  to  decide
fairness it is necessary to have                      regard to a  range  of
factors,   including   the   extent   to   which   the    value    of    the
rights  which  the  appellant  had  under  the  old  law  or  rules  is  now
         diminished to any significant extent.  If one applied  these  dicta
in the                     abstract to the  context  of  the  new  rules  on
deportation in relation to the               appellant, it is  difficult  to
see any significant diminution of the  appellant's                   rights.
At the time of the decision  he  was  already  subject  to  s.32(5)  of  the
         2007 Act so  that  there  was  a  statutory  presumption  that  his
continued                  presence was not conducive to  the  public  good.
Further, for reasons given                   already,  we  do  not  consider
that the new rules can be exhaustive of the               issue  of  whether
the   deportation   order   was   contrary   to   a   person's   Article   8
rights.   Judges  have  to  decide  that  question  by   applying   existing
Strasbourg                  jurisprudence  as  interpreted  by  the   higher
courts.  Under both the pre-9                July 2012  rules  (which  would
have applied if no error of law being found)                   and  the  new
rules,  he  was  entitled  to  the  protection  afforded  to  him   by   s.6
     of the Human Rights Act which we as judges must always accord.

              60.      However, whilst for reasons which will  become  clear
the issue is not                    material to the outcome  of  this  case,
we think that  the  arguments  against                    treating  A362  as
having   retrospective   effect    carry    more    weight.    In    Odelola
their Lordships were concerned with decisions  of  the  Secretary  of  State
              made under the rules in force on or after that date. The  case
did  not                     establish  that  new  rules  are   capable   of
governing  appeals  heard  after  that                date  in  respect   of
decisions   taken   before   it.   Since   the   new   rules   concern   how
the Secretary of State decides claims, it would need  very  clear  words  to
              show that A362 was  intended  to  bind  courts  and  tribunals
hearing  appeals                  against  decisions  that  were  made   and
appealed before A362 came into               force. The wording of  the  new
rule (which refers to "...when the notice of                   intention  to
deport  or   deportation   order,   as   appropriate,    was   served")   is
not  couched in language one would expect if its  retrospective  effect  was
as                contended for by Mr Deller; it does not say, for  example,
"regardless of                  when  the  decision  was  made".  We  remind
ourselves that when s. 85A of                the 2002 Act was  brought  into
force, the drafters decided that an elaborate                   transitional
provision  was  needed,  as  regards  the  effect   of   that   section   on
     current appeals: see Alam [2012] EWCA Civ 960. If one of  the  purposes
of                A362 is to regulate appeals against decisions  taken  long
before 9 July 2012,                 it is difficult  to  see  that  this  is
within the scope of the enabling power to                 make  rules  under
s.3(2)   of   the   Immigration   Act   1971.   Further,   If   Mr    Deller
were right then,  if the FtT when hearing this appeal had not been found  to
                  have erred in law, its determination would have been  (and
could only have                 been) made under the old rules,  yet  solely
because  an  error  of  law  has  been                   found,   it   would
transmogrify   into   a   case   under   the   new    rules.    For    these
reasons we are not persuaded that  the  new  rules  apply  to  the  decision
         under appeal in this case. However, in case we are  wrong  in  that
                  conclusion we shall proceed to address  the  situation  of
the appellant under                 the new rules.


     9. In Ogundimu (Article 8 - new rules) Nigeria [2013]  UKUT  60  (IAC)
        Tribunal stated:




              Relevance of the 'new' immigration rules to our decision

                  81.  The Secretary of State submits that the  tribunal  is
   required  to  determine  the                   issue   of   whether   the
   appellant's deportation would lead to a breach of               Article 8
   ECHR   by   reference   principally   to    whether    he    meets    the
   requirements of the 'new' rules. It was asserted that, if  he  does  meet
   the                 requirements of those rules, then his appeal ought to
   be allowed because               those rules  reflect  where  the  public
   interest  lies;  however,  if  he  does  not                   meet   the
   requirements  of  the  new  rules   then   his   appeal   ought   to   be
   dismissed.


                  82.      The application  of  the  new  rules  to  appeals
   against decisions of the                       Secretary  of  State  made
   prior    to     the     9     July     2012     has     recently     been
   considered by the  Upper  Tribunal  [Upper  Tribunal  Judges  Storey  and
     Coker] in the reported decision of MF (Article 8 - new  rules)  Nigeria
   [2012]                  UKUT 393 (IAC).  The tribunal was  not  persuaded
   that the new rules had                retrospective effect such that they
   were of application to decisions of the                Secretary of State
   taken  prior  to  9  July   2012.   It   further   concluded   that   the
   new rules were not conclusive of the Article  8  issue;  there  were  two
              questions, (i) whether the decision is in accordance with  the
   Rules and (ii)                   whether it is accordance with the law as
   interpreted by the senior courts                    whose  decisions  are
   binding.   The   tribunal    noted    a    number    of    respects    in
   which the new rules appeared to apply tests that have been disapproved of
                  by the courts.

                  83.      In the light of the submissions we have  received
   we propose to analyse the                 case on the factual findings we
   have reached, both under the provision of                   the new rules
   and  the  law  applicable  at  the  time  of   the   original   decision.
   We agree with the panel's decision in MF that a human rights  claim  that
          should have succeeded in 2010 applying the  law  and  policy  then
   applicable                   should not be  defeated  by  new  provisions
   that  are  in   many   respects                       considerably   more
   restrictive.

                  84.      However, we recognise that the issue may  proceed
   on appeal to the Court                of Appeal. Further, in principle it
   may be open to the SSHD to make a fresh                decision to deport
   applying the new rules. Here the substantial delay in                this
   appeal coming before the Upper Tribunal  is  the  responsibility  of  the
          appellant. We therefore propose to examine the claim by  reference
   to the                  new Immigration Rules as well as  the  principles
   of law binding on us                      concerned with  the  evaluation
   of Article 8 cases.


    10. There is therefore no definitive finding that the Immigration Rules
        have no retrospective effect in relation to decisions  taken  prior
        to the 9th July 2012, although this seems to have been the view  of
        the Panel in MF although they  themselves  acknowledge  that  their
        conclusions  may  be  wrong;  hence  their  consideration  of   the
        provisions in the alternative.  Guidance is awaited from the  Court
        of Appeal.  In  both  the  above  determinations  the  issues  were
        considered both under the new Rules as well  as  the  existing  law
        relating to Article 8 ECHR for the sake  of  completeness  which  I
        consider to be the correct position to adopt in  relation  to  this
        appeal.


    11.  Mr  Smart's  position  is  that  the  new  Immigration  Rules  are
        applicable in light of the provisions relied upon by Mr  Deller  in
        MF and that  they  are  applicable  to  all  deportation  decisions
        outstanding at 9th July 2012 irrespective of when the decision  was
        actually taken.




Discussion



    12. DNH cannot succeed under the Immigration Rules.  Paragraph  397  of
        the Immigration Rules acknowledges that a  deportation  order  will
        not be made if a persons removal will be  contrary  to  the  U.K.'s
        obligations under the Refugee Convention or Human Rights Convention
        but states that where it would not be contrary to these obligations
        it will only  be  in  exceptional  circumstances  that  the  public
        interest in deportation is outweighed.


    13. Paragraph 398 contains provisions  to  be  taken  into  account  by
        reference  to  the  actual  period  of  imprisonment  to  which  an
        individual  has  been   sentenced.   Although   DNH   received   an
        indeterminate sentence the actual period  of  imprisonment  imposed
        upon him was six years against which a discount was allowed for the
        six months in custody he had served, giving a minimum period to  be
        served of one half of the six-year term less the six months already
        served, amounting to a two and a half years custodial  element.  He
        was not sentenced to only two and a half year as the  sentence  was
        six years. The two  and  half  years  was  the  minimum  period  of
        imprisonment he was to serve  in  accordance  with  the  provisions
        relating to indeterminate sentences. It is therefore 398 (a)  which
        is relevant namely that the deportation  of  the  person  from  the
        United Kingdom is conducive to the public good  because  they  have
        been convicted of an offence for which they had been sentenced to a
        period of imprisonment of at least four years.


    14. If an individual who does not receive an indeterminate sentence  is
        sentenced to six years imprisonment they would only serve  half  of
        that sentence with the rest  being  served  on  licence,  with  any
        discount for periods served on remand. It is on this basis  that  I
        find the sentence was for a period of six years for DNH.


    15. Paragraph 399 does not apply as 398 (b) or (c) are  not  applicable
        and nor is 399A for the same reason. The provisions under the Rules
        that as the deportation is not contrary to the Secretary of State's
        view of what  constitutes  a  proper  human  right  proportionality
        assessment, as reflected by the provisions of the Rules,  means  it
        will only be in exceptional circumstances that the public  interest
        in deportation is outweighed. DNH is therefore not able to  succeed
        under the Rules although it has always been accepted that the  main
        issue in this appeal is the proportionality of the  decision  under
        Article 8 ECHR which I shall consider next.


    16. In relation to Article 8 ECHR,  it  is  not  disputed  DNH  has  an
        established family and private life in the United Kingdom. This  is
        a preserved finding. There is  a  considerable  volume  of  written
        evidence that has been provided on his behalf all of which  I  have
        considered in detail. Oral evidence was given at  the  hearing  and
        leave granted to his wife to file an additional  witness  statement
        which I have also considered. The statement confirms  the  youngest
        child came home a few days prior to the hearing  and  has  received
        medical home visits and medication and  that  there  has  been  one
        readmission to hospital. His situation is  delicate  as  his  lungs
        were damaged at birth and L U-H  claims she needs  the  support  of
        her husband to  help  with  their  three  children.   Although  her
        parents live next door, they work full-time and so cannot  help  as
        much as he can other than at weekends. L U-H states it is not clear
        whether she can return to work as  she  hoped  to  in  November  to
        support the family. She has been the  main  breadwinner  since  her
        husband was told he could not  work.  She  believes  her  husband's
        continued presence is of great importance to the family.


    17. I have also received within a supplementary trial bundle  documents
        in which the older children have responded to  a  number  of  typed
        questions. P U-H  states  she  will  feel  upset  about  moving  to
        Jamaica, that she feels happy when she sees her dad  and  that  she
        would be devastated if she could not see him and that it would take
        her an awfully long time to get over it, and that it would be  like
        taking a large part of her heart out and  throwing  it  away.   She
        states she will feel extremely saddened that she would not be  able
        to see her father often enough.  She  likes  him  to  take  her  to
        school and to the shop and to tuck her in at night.


    18. DU-H said he will be sad and unhappy if he had to go to Jamaica, he
        feels happy when he sees his father, will feel sad and  worried  if
        he could not see him and will be  sad  about  leaving  him  if  his
        father went to Jamaica.  His likes his father taking him  swimming,
        playing football, and cooking dumplings.


    19. The above are plausible  feelings/emotional  expressions  by  young
        children in a situation  where  there  is  the  prospect  of  being
        separated from one of their parents and I accept that so far as the
        children are concerned they would ideally like the family to remain
        together.


    20. I accept this is a close family unit and it is  important  to  note
        this is not a case in which it is suggested L U-H or  the  children
        are expected to leave  the  United  Kingdom  as  they  are  British
        nationals and European citizens. It is a family splitting case.


    21. Guidance of the approach  to  be  taken  in  assessing  the  public
        interest in  the  balancing  exercise  has  been  provided  by  the
        Tribunal  in  Masih  (deportation  -  public   interest   -   basic
        principles) Pakistan [2012] UKUT 00046(IAC).  The  Tribunal  said
        that so long as account is taken of the following basic principles,
        there is at present no need for further citation  of  authority  on
        the public interest side of the balancing exercise.  The  following
        basic  principles  can  be  derived  from  the  present  case   law
        concerning the issue of the public  interest  in  relation  to  the
        deportation of foreign criminals:


              (i)      In a case of automatic deportation, full account must
   be taken of  the                   strong  public  interest  in  removing
   foreign  citizens  convicted  of                      serious  offences,
   which lies not only in the prevention of further                 offences
   on  the  part   of   the   individual   concerned,   but   in   deterring
   others from committing them in the first place.


              (ii)     Deportation of foreign criminals expresses  society's
   condemnation of                  serious criminal activity  and  promotes
   public  confidence  in  the                       treatment  of   foreign
   citizens who have committed them.


              (iii)    The starting-point for  assessing  the  facts  of the
   offence of which an                   individual has been committed,  and
   their effect on others, and on the                  public  as  a  whole,
   must be the view taken by the sentencing judge.


              (iv)     The appeal has to be dealt with on the basis  of  the
   situation at the                 date of the hearing.


              (v)      Full account should also be taken of any developments
   since                   sentence was passed, for example  the  result  of
   any  disciplinary                        adjudications   in   prison   or
   detention, or any OASys or licence report.


    22. Further guidance on how the balancing exercise should be  conducted
        has been provided in the cases of Boultif v Switzerland [2001] ECHR
        54273 as confirmed by Uner v the Netherlands [2007] Imm AR 303.  In
        those cases the Court said that  in  order  to  assess  whether  an
        expulsion  measure  was  necessary  in  a  democratic  society  and
        proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued, the following criteria
        had to be considered.


              (i)  The nature and the seriousness of the  offence  committed
      by the                Appellant;


              (ii) The length of the Appellant's stay in  the  country  from
      which he or           she was to be expelled;


              (iii)    The time that  had  elapsed  since  the  offence  was
      committed and the             claimant's conduct during that period.


              (iv)     The nationalities of the various parties concerned;


              (v)  The Appellant's  family  situation,  such  as  length  of
      marriage and              other factors expressing  the  effectiveness
      of the Appellant's family              life;
              (vi) Whether the spouse knew about the offence at the time  he
      or she           entered into the family relationship;


              (vii)    Whether there are children in the marriage and if  so
      their ages;


              (viii)   The seriousness and the difficulties which the Spouse
      is likely to              encounter in the country of the  Appellant's
      origin;


              (ix) The best interests and well being of any children of  the
      Appellant;             and  in  particular  the  seriousness  of   any
      difficulties that they would           be likely to encounter  in  the
      country to which the Appellant would            be expelled;


              (x)      The solidity of social, cultural and family ties with
      the host country              and with the country of destination.


    23. In relation to these individual elements I find as follows:


    24. The nature and the seriousness of  the  offence  committed  by  the
        Appellant: the index offence committed by  the  appellant  is  very
        serious as it involved not only the use  of  a  bladed  weapon  but
        extreme violence  against  an  innocent  bystander.  HHJ  Challinor
        specifically states that  DNH  has  been  convicted  of  a  serious
        offence as defined by paragraph  224  Criminal  Justice  Act  2003.
        Section 224 (1) states an offence as a 'specified offence' if it is
        a specified violent  offence  or  a  specified  sexual  offence.  A
        specified violent offence is defined in Part 1 of  Schedule  15  of
        the Act. It is not disputed before me that this  includes  offences
        of the nature of those committed by DNH.  Examples of such offences
        include manslaughter, an offence  under  section  18  of  that  Act
        (wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily  harm),  an  offence
        under section 20 of that Act (malicious wounding), an offence under
        section 47 of that Act (assault occasioning actual bodily harm).


    25. Section 224 (2) defines a serious offence as  a  specified  offence
        punishable in  the  case  of  a  person  over  the  age  of  18  by
        imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a determinate  period  of
        ten years or more. HHJ Challinor specifically referred  to  section
        229  of  the  Act  which  provides  statutory  provisions  for  the
        assessment of 'dangerousness'. HHJ  Challinor  found  DNH  posed  a
        significant  risk  to  members  of  the  public  of  serious   harm
        occasioned by the commission of further specified  offences,  which
        might include one or more of the offences outlined above,  together
        possibly with others more fully detailed in the  relevant  schedule
        to the Act.


    26. The length of the Appellant's stay in the country from which he  or
        she was to be expelled; I have set out the chronology  above  which
        shows DNH  has been in the United Kingdom since the September 2000,
         a period of nearly thirteen years.


    27. The time that had elapsed since the offence was committed  and  the
        claimant's conduct during that period: the offence was committed on
        18th May 2005 but DNH  was  only  sentenced  in  2007  after  being
        convicted at trial. There is no evidence of  him  having  committed
        further offences and his conduct in prison is  said  to  have  been
        exemplary. He is currently on bail and was released at the  end  of
        his minimum term as a result of a positive assessment and report to
        the Parole Board. He has not reoffend since  he  has  been  in  the
        community although he has been aware  of  the  pending  deportation
        proceedings and is the subject of the licence which, if  the  terms
        are breached, may result in  his  being  readmitted  to  serve  the
        remainder of his sentence.


    28. The nationalities of  the  various  parties  concerned;  DNH  is  a
        Jamaican national. The children and his wife are British  citizens.
        DNH and L U-H have been married since May 2010, a period  of  three
        years.


    29. The Appellant's family situation, such as length  of  marriage  and
        other factors  expressing  the  effectiveness  of  the  Appellant's
        family life: is not disputed there is family life between DNH,  his
        wife and their children. They live in a close family unit.


    30. Whether the spouse knew about the offence at the  time  he  or  she
        entered into the family relationship ; the  chronology  shows  that
        not only did DNH marry his wife  after  he  was  convicted  of  the
        offences,  they  were  both  aware  of  the  Secretary  of  State's
        intention to deport him from  the  United  Kingdom.   The  youngest
        child was also conceived and born in circumstances in which it  was
        known DNH's immigration status is precarious and there  is  a  real
        risk that he will be removed.


    31. Whether there are children in the marriage and if  so  their  ages:
        see above regarding the dates of birth of the three children.


    32. The seriousness and the difficulties which the Spouse is likely  to
        encounter in the country of  the  Appellant's  origin:   as  stated
        above this is a family splitting case and it is not suggested  that
        either L U-H or the children shall be removed to Jamaica with  him.
        They are British citizens and so are  entitled  to  remain  in  the
        United Kingdom. They are also European citizens who are entitled to
        enjoy the benefits flowing from such status within  the  boundaries
        of the European Union.


    33. The best interests and well being of any children of the Appellant;
        and in particular the seriousness of  any  difficulties  that  they
        would be likely to encounter in the country to which the  Appellant
        would be expelled:  I accept that the best  interests  of  children
        will be served by them continuing to be  brought  up  in  a  stable
        family  environment  including  their  mother  and  father.     The
        children have no experience of living in Jamaica and, as stated, it
        is not expected that they will have to live there.


    34. The solidity of social, cultural and  family  ties  with  the  host
        country and with  the  country  of  destination:   DNH  has  strong
        cultural and  family  ties  to  the  United  Kingdom.  He  has  not
        suggested he has no ties to Jamaica and I note  that  when  he  was
        initially served with the decision to deport he  agreed  to  return
        voluntarily to Jamaica. There is no evidence he will not be able to
        return there and continue  to  live  an  independent  life  in  the
        country he grew up in and of which he has relevant life experience.
         I also note Section 6 of the OASys report in which it is  recorded
        that his mother and siblings live in Jamaica with  whom  he  has  a
        supportive relationship and to whom he writes on a  regular  basis.
        It is recorded that he was upset at not being  able  to  return  to
        Jamaica on his release and, although he would like to remain in the
        United Kingdom with his family, he did not advise the author of the
        report of any adverse consequences should he be returned to Jamaica
        where in fact he has another child, a 13-year-old daughter.


    35. The most up-to-date information regarding the risk posed by DNH  is
        that provided by Staffordshire and West Midlands Probation Trust in
        letters dated 7th May 2013 and 9th May 2013 to be  found  in  DNH's
        supplementary trial bundle. They assess DNH as posing a medium risk
        of harm to the public as  a  result  of  his  aggressive  behaviour
        although I note and take into account the positive elements of  the
        report based upon progress made to date by DNH and referred  to  be
        Mr Fripp in his  intervention  during  the  course  of  Mr  Smart's
        submissions. I have also noted the  latest  OASys  report  and  the
        assessment of risk by the author of that document in section R10 as
        medium, a reduction from 'high' in the earlier report, stating that
        the risk is to the general  public,  the  nature  of  the  risk  is
        violence and aggression resulting in physical injury, the  risk  is
        likely to be greatest when in conflict in disputes with others,  if
        a weapon is being carried, but is not assessed as being  immediate.
        The factors likely to increase risk are if DNH  places  himself  in
        unsuitable  environments/situations  of  potential  conflict   with
        others.


    36. It is also recorded in that section :


              Parole 24/11/2011 - DNH was initially assessed as presenting a
   high level              of serious harm to the public and known adult  at
   the point of his sentence.            This assessment was  based  on  the
   fact that the offence was unprovoked          and DNH's causal use  of  a
   weapon demonstrated a propensity  towards            violence  which  was
   perceived as concern due to there being an imminent              risk  of
   further  similar  offending  behaviour.  DNH  has   worked   hard   since
   his last parole hearing  to  address  the  identified  areas  of  concern
   relating to             his risk. Although DNH  had  initially  expressed
   reservations about moving             into the therapeutic  community  at
   HMP Dovegate, I consider that he has          benefited  enormously  from
   his time there, demonstrated by  his  significant              change  in
   attitudes  and  thinking  in  regards  to  his  offence.  DNH  now  takes
   full responsibility for his offence and accepts that  his  poor  thinking
   and            attitudes leads to him behaving in  an  unacceptable  way.
   DNH now                 recognises what his triggers in relation  to  his
   offending and how to avoid            them. Risk now assessed  as  medium
   to the public and not deemed                  imminent.


    37. It is also relevant that DNH received  an  indeterminate  sentence.
        This is a prison sentence where the court sets the minimum term  of
        imprisonment an offender must serve before becoming eligible to  be
        considered for release by the Parole Board. There are two types  of
        indeterminate sentence: imprisonment for life and imprisonment  for
        public protection (IPP).  Once an offender has served  the  minimum
        term set by the court, the Parole Board will  decide  whether  the
        offender can be released as illustrated by the copy passage set out
        above. DNH is the subject of an  IPP.  He  has  been  released  but
        remains subject to an IPP licence and may be recalled to prison  if
        at any point he  is  considered a  risk  to  the  public.  He  was
        originally release to a hostel but returned to the family  home  in
        September 2012. After ten years he may apply for the licence to  be
        cancelled. This decision is at the discretion of the  Parole  Board
        and Mr Fripp referred to the reduction in his need  to  attend  the
        Probation Service offices and their support for  him  remaining  in
        the United Kingdom. The imposition of such  a  sentence  represents
        the view taken by  the  Sentencing  Judge  regarding  the  need  to
        protect the public from potential future harm caused by DNH at that
        time.


    38. Whilst DNH was in prison his wife clearly received support and  the
        evidence shows that her parents live next door although she  claims
        they are in employment and only able to assist at weekends.  It  is
        likely that  other  periods  of  assistance  are  available  but  I
        appreciate that if they have working commitments  these  will  take
        precedence. I note that L U-H has been the primary  breadwinner  of
        the family although she has currently not returned to work and that
        if DNH is removed she may not be able  to  do  so  and  may  become
        reliant on public funds.  Such an economic argument is a matter for
        Parliament as the Secretary of State who has no choice but to  make
        a deportation order as a result of the statutory provisions and the
        fact his removal is, as a result, to be found to  be  conducive  to
        the public good.


    39. I find there is insufficient evidence to show that it is imperative
        for DNH to remain in the United Kingdom for the sake of the welfare
        of any of the children although his presence  here  is,  I  accept,
        something that must be seen to be in the children's best interests.
        Although L U-H will no doubt be distressed if he  is  removed  from
        the United Kingdom there is insufficient evidence to show that  she
        will not be able to cope  personally  or  that  the  children  will
        suffer disproportionately if she has to parent  them  as  a  single
        parent.   There  are  many  such  parents  in  the  United  Kingdom
        successfully bring up their children and separation as a result  of
        divorce is an all too common phenomena in modern  families,  albeit
        that in most situations the father figure remains  in  the  country
        and has face to face contact with the children.  I  accept  that  a
        deportation order will have  the  effect  of  limiting  contact  to
        indirect contact and visits to Jamaica, when funds allow, and  that
        the deportation order will  remain  in  force  for  a  considerable
        period of time due to the nature of the offence. I  do  not  accept
        that assistance from L U-H's family  will  not  to  be  forthcoming
        especially  before,  during,  and  immediately  after  the  removal
        process and whilst the  family  adjust.  The  evidence  suggests  a
        supportive family and extended family unit. It has not  been  shown
        that  professional  medical  or  social  assistance  will  not   be
        available to assist L U-H and the children either, if required.  In
        relation to the baby I note  L  U-H's  evidence  that  he  requires
        medical care as a result of lung damage and that during  this  time
        DNH has provided practical and emotional support but again  it  has
        not  been  shown  that   whilst   preferable,   such   support   is
        determinative of the issues I have to consider.


    40. The weight to be given to family life created a time  when  it  was
        known an individual's immigration status is precarious has been the
        subject of decisions by the European and domestic courts. In R  (on
        the application of  Nagre)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
        Department [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin) Mr Justice Sales held the family
        life between the Claimant and his partner was precarious because it
        was established at a time when the Claimant had no right to  be  in
        the UK. The approach to such cases in the European Court  of  Human
        Rights  ("ECtHR")  was  that  removal  was  disproportionate   only
        exceptionally. A material  consideration  was  whether  there  were
        insurmountable obstacles to the relocation of the resident  partner
        to a claimant's country of origin to continue  family  life  there:
        Rodrigues da Silva and Hoogkamer v Netherlands (2007)  44  EHRR  34
        applied. That question was not always decisive. A range of  factors
        bore upon the question  of  proportionality.   In  Nunez  v  Norway
        (Application  No.  55597/09)  ECtHR  (Fourth   Section),   although
        allowing the appeal, the ECtHR said that an important consideration
        was whether family life was created at  a  time  when  the  persons
        involved were aware that the immigration status of one of them  was
        such that the persistence of that family life within the host State
        would from the outset be precarious. Where this was the  case,  the
        removal of a non-national family member would be incompatible  with
        Article  8  only  in  exceptional  circumstances.   In  R  (on  the
        application  of  Mahmood)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the   Home
        Department [2001] INLR 1 the Court of Appeal said  that  "Knowledge
        on the part of one spouse at the time of marriage  that  rights  of
        residence of  the  other  are  precarious,  militates  against  the
        finding that an order excluding the latter spouse violates  Article
        8 and in Y v Russia (Application No  20113/7),  reported  in  2009,
        ECtHR (First Section) the ECtHR appeared  to  suggest  that,  where
        family life was created at a time when the  persons  involved  were
        aware that the immigration status of one of  them  was  precarious,
        then removal of the  non  national  family  member  would  only  be
        incompatible with Article 8 in exceptional circumstances.


    41. Sales J in Nagre referred to the case of  Rodrigues  da  Silva  and
        Hoogkamer v Netherlands (2007) 44  EHRR  34,  in  which  the  ECtHR
        explained the approach at para.  39,  and  included  the  following
        comments:  "....  Another  important  consideration  will  also  be
        whether family life was created at a time when the persons involved
        were aware that the immigration status of one of them was such that
        the persistence of that family life within  the  host  state  would
        from the outset be precarious. The Court has previously  held  that
        where this is the case  it  is  likely  only  to  be  in  the  most
        exceptional circumstances that  the  removal  of  the  non-national
        family member will constitute a violation of Art.8 ."


    42. Whilst our domestic courts  have  resisted  the  imposition  of  an
        'exceptionality' test in its case law and prefers a different  test
        of 'reasonableness' this is a specific term repeated on a number of
        occasions and applicable in European law when  considering  Article
        8. I accept this  is  only  one  factor  and  have  approached  the
        assessment on the basis it  is  not  determinative  on  the  facts,
        especially as the two older children were born  before  deportation
        action was commenced.


    43. Not withstanding the progress DNH  has  made  with  regard  to  his
        offending behaviour and the reduction in the assessment of risk and
        his, to date, success in the community setting, he still  has  been
        assessed as being a medium  risk  of  reoffending.  The  Sentencing
        Judge noted there have been other offences in the  past,  including
        possession of a bladed instrument, the  escalating  nature  of  the
        offending in terms of seriousness, and the need for the  long  term
        protection of society as represented by the nature of the  sentence
        handed down.


    44. It is also important to note this is an appeal against an automatic
        deportation decision.  In Richards v Secretary  of  State  for  the
        Home Department [2013] EWCA Civ 244 the Jamaican  claimant  arrived
        in the United Kingdom in 1999 and had a daughter aged six. He had a
        number of serious drugs offences. The UT dismissed his appeal.  The
        Court of the Appeal upheld the decision and said that the important
        point was that the strong  public  interest  in  deporting  foreign
        criminals was not merely the policy of the Secretary of  State  but
        the judgment of Parliament. That gave it special weight  which  the
        courts needed to recognise.


    45. In the later case of SS (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 550  at paragraph
        55, Laws LJ stated:


               55.  None  of  this,  I  apprehend,  is   inconsistent   with
   established principle, and                the approach I have outlined is
   well supported by  the  authorities                       concerning  the
   decision-maker's   margin   of   discretion.    The    leading    Supreme
   Court cases, ZH and H(H), demonstrate  that  the  interests  of  a  child
   affected                by a removal decision are a matter of substantial
   importance, and that the                  court must proceed on a  proper
   understanding of the facts which                        illuminate  those
   interests  (though   upon   the   latter   point   I   would   not   with
   respect accept that the decision  in  Tinizaray  should  be  regarded  as
          establishing anything in the nature of general principle). At  the
   same time               H(H)  shows  the  impact  of  a  powerful  public
   interest (in that case                    extradition) on what  needs  to
   be demonstrated for an Article 8 claim to                   prevail  over
   it.  Proportionality,  the  absence  of  an  "exceptionality"  rule,  and
     the meaning  of  "a  primary  consideration"  are  all,  when  properly
          understood, consonant with the force to be attached  in  cases  of
   the present                  kind to the two  drivers  of  the  decision-
   maker's margin of discretion: the                   policy's  source  and
   the  policy's  nature,  and   in   particular   to   the   great   weight
   which the 2007 Act attributes to the deportation of foreign criminals.


    46. The Court found that whilst the authorities demonstrate there is no
        rule of exceptionality for Article 8, they also clearly  show  that
        the more pressing the public interest in  removal  or  deportation,
        the stronger must be the claim under Article 8 if it is to prevail.



    47. Mr Fripp sought to argue that the  exceptions  to  deportation  are
        also part of the statutory provisions as so should be  given  equal
        weight  to  the  requirement  to  deport  contained  in  the   same
        provisions. The inclusion of the exceptions is an  issue  noted  by
        the Court of Appeal who, notwithstanding this fact,  gave  guidance
        upon the weight to be attached to the fact  that  once  a  relevant
        conviction  occurs,  absent  an  ability  to  prove  an  applicable
        exception, an individual  must  be  removed.  That  Parliament  had
        passed legislation to this effect in the terms referred to  by  the
        Court is stated to be indicative of the weight that should be given
        to such a  clear  public  policy  statement  when  undertaking  the
        Article 8 balancing exercise. It is at this point that the judgment
        in SS (Nigeria) is of relevance and assistance. That  decision  was
        also confirmed and followed in  the  later  case  of  CW  (Jamaica)
        [2013] EWCA Civ 915 in which Lord Justice McCombe stated:


              34. In considering these provisions in the SS (Nigeria) case
   (supra), Laws LJ                 considered extensively the law relating
   to the balance between Article 8                   rights and the public
   interest in deporting foreign criminals, the latter being
   forcibly emphasised by the statutory provisions which I have just quoted.
                  At paragraph [48] Laws LJ said this:
                   "....Where such potential deportees have raised claims
      under Article 8,              seeking to resist deportation by relying
      on the interests of a child or                  children having
      British citizenship, I think with respect that insufficient
      attention has been paid to the weight to be attached, in virtue of its
      origin           in primary legislation, to the policy of deporting
      foreign criminals."
                   At paragraph 54, the learned Lord Justice added:
                   "I would draw particular attention to the provision
      contained in s.33(7):              "section 32(4) applies despite the
      application of Exception 1...", that is to          say, a foreign
      criminal's deportation remains conducive to the public good
      notwithstanding his successful reliance on Article 8. I said at
      paragraph 46              that while the authorities demonstrate that
      there is no rule of exceptionality              for Article 8, they
      also clearly show that the more pressing the public
      interest in removal or deportation, the stronger must be the claim
      under            Article 8 if it is to prevail. The pressing nature of
      the public interest here is            vividly informed by the fact
      that by Parliament's express declaration the             public
      interest is injured if the criminal's deportation is not effected.
      Such a           result could in my judgment only be justified by a
      very strong claim                  indeed."


    48. The question therefore, when balancing the competing interests,  is
        whether the scales fall in favour of DNH  and  his  family  or  the
        Secretary of  State.  Having  very  carefully  considered  all  the
        elements  of  this  appeal  relied  upon  by  DNH,   the   detailed
        submissions made on his behalf by Mr Fripp, and those of  Mr  Smart
        for the Secretary of  State,  I  do  not  find  that  it  has  been
        established that the case under Article 8 is sufficiently strong to
        prevail over  the  extremely  pressing  public  interest  in  DNH's
        deportation. I find Secretary of State has discharged the burden of
        proof upon her to the required standard to prove that DNH's removal
        from the United Kingdom is proportionate.  Borrowing a phrase  from
        the judgment in CW (Jamaica), the Article 8 claim is far from being
        "very strong". It is impossible to see how, therefore, those claims
        could outweigh the express declaration of the  public  interest  in
        the deportation of a foreign criminal, such as  DNH,  as  expressly
        stated in the statute.  The risk of serious potential harm  to  the
        public still remains and there is a very strong  deterrent  element
        in this appeal in relation to non-nationals  who  choose  to  carry
        knives or other bladed articles and to use them to carry  out  acts
        of violence against third parties which is an increasing problem in
        British society.


Decision

    49. The First-tier Tribunal Judge materially erred in law. I set  aside
        the decision of the  original  Judge.  I  remake  the  decision  as
        follows. This appeal is dismissed.


   Anonymity.


    50. The First-tier Tribunal made an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i)  of
        the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.


          I continue that  order  (pursuant  to  rule  14  of  the  Tribunal
   Procedure               (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).
