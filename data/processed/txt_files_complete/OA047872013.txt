For the Respondent:    Mr S Whitwell, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS



 1. The appellant, who was born on 1 May 1983, is a citizen of  India.   He
    applied for entry clearance with a view  to  settlement  as  a  partner
    under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules,  but  his  application  was
    refused by the respondent on 10 January 2013.  The  refusal  letter  is
    dated the same date.  The appellant was not satisfied, for reasons  set
    out in the  refusal  letter,  that  the  appellant  was  in  a  genuine
    subsisting  relationship  with  Ms  Webb,  despite  acknowledging   the
    submission of a marriage certificate and photographs.  In particular it
    was noted in the refusal letter that the  appellant  had  had  previous
    entry clearance as the dependent partner of his former wife and that he
    had not informed the immigration authorities in  this  country  of  any
    change of circumstances, which was not consistent with  his  claim  now
    that prior to his divorce from his former wife he had resided  with  Ms
    Webb.

 2. The application was also refused on the grounds that the appellant  did
    not satisfy the financial requirements under the Rules, and nor did  he
    satisfy the English language requirement.

 3. The appellant appealed against this decision and his appeal  was  heard
    before First-tier Tribunal Judge Whiting  sitting  at  Columbus  House,
    Newport on 1 October 2013.

 4. In a  determination  promulgated  on  8  October  2013,  Judge  Whiting
    dismissed the appellant's appeal, both under the Immigration Rules, and
    also under Article 8.

 5. The appellant appealed against this decision and was granted  leave  by
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Frances on 27 November 2013.

The Hearing

 6. I heard submissions on behalf of both parties, which are set out in  my
    Record of Proceedings, in which I attempted to record everything  which
    was said to me.  Accordingly, I shall  not  set  out  below  everything
    which was said to me during the course of the hearing, but shall  refer
    only to such of the submissions as is necessary  for  the  purposes  of
    this determination.  However, I have had regard to everything which was
    said during the course of the hearing, as well as to all the  documents
    contained within the files, whether or not  the  same  is  referred  to
    specifically below.

 7. On behalf of the respondent, Mr Whitwell confirmed that it was not  the
    respondent's case now that the marriage between the appellant  and  the
    sponsor was not a genuine marriage.  The respondent did  not  challenge
    the First-tier Tribunal's finding that it was.  However, the  financial
    requirements under the Rules had not been satisfied, and  nor  had  the
    English language requirement.  So far as Article 8 was concerned, given
    that the sponsor was a single lady with two adult children in  the  UK,
    there was nothing unduly harsh in requiring her to  relocate  to  India
    (in circumstances where the  requirements  under  the  Rules  were  not
    satisfied) and there was no error of law in the First-tier Tribunal  so
    finding.

 8. In the course of argument, on behalf of  the  appellant,  Mr  Anisuddin
    eventually accepted that based on  the  evidence  which  had  been  put
    before the First-tier Tribunal, the judge's finding  that  the  English
    language requirement had not  been  satisfied  could  not  properly  be
    challenged.

 9. With regard to the financial requirements, it  was  asserted  that  the
    sponsor had a second employment, from which she  received  over  ï¿½3,000
    per year.

10. So far as Article 8 was concerned, before concluding that  the  sponsor
    could re-locate to India, the judge should have taken into account that
    she did not speak the language or like the food.

Discussion

11. Even on the appellant's own case, it is clear that his appeal could not
    have succeeded under the Rules, as the English language requirement was
    not satisfied.  Further, in my judgment, the judge's finding  that  the
    appellant had not established on the balance of probabilities that  the
    sponsor had the supplementary income as claimed was open to him and  is
    adequately reasoned (from paragraphs 18 onwards).

12. The judge asked himself the right questions with regard to  Article  8,
    and his  finding  that  the  decision  was  proportionate  in  all  the
    circumstances is again adequately reasoned and was open to him.

13. If the appellant is able to provide satisfactory evidence that both the
    financial requirements and the English language requirement  have  been
    satisfied,  there  is  no  reason  why  he  should  not  make   another
    application.  However,  satisfactory  evidence  with  regard  to  these
    requirements had not been placed before the  First-tier  Tribunal,  and
    the judge was entitled to reject the appeal under Article 8  also,  and
    made no error in so doing.

14. It follows that this appeal must be dismissed, and I will so find.

Decision

The appellant's appeal is dismissed, on all grounds.
