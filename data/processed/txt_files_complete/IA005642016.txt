Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The parties are as above, but the rest of this decision refers to  them
    as they were in the FtT.

 2. The appellant applied on 3 March 2015 for leave to remain to  establish
    a business under the Turkey - European Community Association Agreement.

 3. On 14 January 2016 the SSHD refused that application, referring  to  �4
    of HC510, "... whether in light of [the applicant's] character, conduct
    or associations it is undesirable to permit him to remain".

 4. The appellant's passport was found on examination:
           o to have had pages 9 and 10 removed;
           o to have a Netherlands visa application stamp  hidden  under  a
             Taiwan visa on page 21; and
           o to have an Azerbaijan visa on page 22 which was  not  original
             to that page, and originally adhered to page 13.

 5. The SSHD was also not satisfied that the appellant  would  be  bringing
    into the country money of his own to establish  in  business,  dues  to
    apparent discrepancies in documentation.

 6. Designated FtT Judge J G Macdonald allowed the appellant's appeal by  a
    decision promulgated on 8 February 2017.

 7. The SSHD appeals to the UT on these grounds:
         Ground one
         The first issue  was  whether  the  appellant  submitted  a  forged
         passport ... The importance of this is set out in the  reasons  for
         refusal letter, namely that reliance on such a passport  "makes  it
         undesirable for him to remain". The judge has  not  approached  the
         question in this way, instead asking himself "the burden is on  the
         Secretary of  State  to  show  the  appellant  did  interfere  with
         passport". This is not what the SSHD has to show in this case.
         Instead the judge considers immaterial matters,  such  as  querying
         why the appellant would alter his own passport, ignoring the  point
         that it was agreed there had been such alteration.  The  judge  did
         not consider the  appropriate  question  of  whether  submitting  a
         document which has been proven  to  be  tampered  with  amounts  to
         circumstances meaning was not desirable for him to be granted leave
         to remain.
         Furthermore,  the  judge  gives  reasons  why  he  finds  that  the
         appellant did not have anything to do with  the  tampering  of  the
         passport. That is irrelevant, given that the SSHD has not  asserted
         that the appellant altered his  passport.  His  passport  has  been
         altered ... the question is whether the appellant knew it had been.
         The judge failed to consider this point. The SSHD does not need  to
         show the appellant altered his own passport, but that  he  knew  it
         had been altered. This is the only reason given  by  the  judge  to
         find that the first ground is not made out at paragraph 25. Failure
         to address the proper questions render this finding wrong in law.
         Ground two
         Further, the judge  materially  erred  in  his  assessment  of  the
         question whether the money  the  appellant  used  to  purchase  the
         business was indeed  his  money.  The  judge  has  failed  to  give
         adequate reasons why the critical discrepancy in the  evidence  ...
         does not go against the appellant.
         The appellant claimed that �10,800 was paid for property in Turkey.
         The amount received in the  UK  was  �10,788.  No  explanation  was
         offered as to why this was different, in fact the appellant did not
         know. The judge appears to have carried  out  his  own  calculation
         factoring in a commission cost of �25 and total costs of �165,  but
         that does not answer the point and is not an explanation  from  the
         appellant ...
         Therefore the judge materially erred by failing to adequately  give
         reasons why the money was the appellant's, and perversely  factored
         other amounts into the equation which  did  not  emanate  from  the
         appellant's evidence.
         Given this, and given the unsatisfactory explanation  for  why  the
         appellant's passport was a forgery, the judge failed to  conduct  a
         holistic assessment of the appellant's credibility  ...  such  that
         the SSHD cannot understand why the appeal was allowed.

 8. The SSHD's decision and her grounds of appeal to the UT  say  that  the
    passport was a forgery.  However,  Mr  Diwyncz  clarified  that  it  is
    common ground that the passport has been tampered with, but it is not a
    forgery.  He accepted that it had been for the SSHD to  show  that  the
    appellant's conduct was such that it was undesirable to permit  him  to
    remain.

 9. Mr Diwyncz sensibly conceded that the "discrepancy" identified  in  the
    second reason for refusing the application and at ground two was minor.
     The difference of �12  might  easily  be  accounted  for  by  a  small
    variation in the exchange rate or by transaction  costs.   He  accepted
    that this point added little to the SSHD's case.

10. The SSHD's grounds of appeal are  somewhat  garbled,  and  although  Mr
    Diwyncz made rather more sense of them, nothing was  left  which  rises
    above disagreement with factual findings which the judge  was  entitled
    to make, and for which he gave legally adequate reasons.

11. Ground two aims at the very high  target  of  showing  that  the  judge
    reached a perverse conclusion, but the evidence was  eminently  capable
    of being interpreted as the judge did.  The  amount  of  the  financial
    difference is very small.  The possibility of transaction costs is  not
    outrageous speculation, but obvious comment, with  some  basis  in  the
    evidence (the judge refers to the documents before him).

12. Reading his decision fairly and as a whole, the judge plainly found not
    only that the appellant did not himself tamper with  the  passport  but
    that he did not know  it  had  been  tampered  with.   The  judge  gave
    sensible reasons: it was not suggested to him that  the  appellant  had
    anything to gain from  the  tampering;  having  travelled  widely,  the
    appellant's passport had not always been in his hands,  so  others  had
    the opportunity to tamper; the  changes  made  required  expertise  and
    dexterity which were beyond the appellant; and the  appellant  and  his
    brother both impressed as truthful witnesses.   That  last  finding  is
    expressed in relation to the second matter, but  it  plainly  bears  on
    both.

13. There was evidence by which the case might  have  been  decided  either
    way, but no error is shown in the judge coming down on the side he did.

14. The decision of the FtT, allowing the appeal brought by Mr Kilic, shall
    stand.

15. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
