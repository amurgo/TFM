                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     Miss Crichton, of Katani & Co, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Clark, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against the decision of FtT Judge  Cowx,  promulgated
    on 1 October 2019.  There are 4 grounds,  set  out  in  an  application
    dated 10 October 2019.  The FtT granted permission on 2 December 2019.

 2. Mr Clark conceded  that  the  grounds  disclosed  errors  by  the  FtT,
    particularly around the expert report, such that the decision  fell  to
    be set aside. It stands only as a  record  of  what  was  said  at  the
    hearing.

 3. There is a presumption that the UT will proceed to remake decisions, of
    which parties are reminded in  directions  issued  with  the  grant  of
    permission.  However, parties agreed that the nature of  this  case  is
    such that it is appropriate under section 12 of the 2007 Act, and under
    Practice Statement 7.2, to remit to  the  FtT  for  an  entirely  fresh
    hearing.

 4. The member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case are not to include
    Judge Cowx.

 5. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
