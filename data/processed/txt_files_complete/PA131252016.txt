Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms L Santamera, Counsel instructed by
     Barnes Harrild & Dyer Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr David Mills, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Pursuant to Rule 14(1) of  the  Upper  Tribunal  Procedure  Rules,  the
    appellant is granted anonymity.  No report of these  proceedings  shall
    directly or indirectly identify  him  or  any  member  of  his  family.
    Failure to comply with this direction could lead to contempt  of  Court
    proceedings.

 2. The appellant appeals from the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    dismissing his appeal against the decision of the Secretary of State to
    refuse his protection and human rights claims which he had  pursued  on
    the ground that he had  become  of  adverse  interest  to  the  Iranian
    authorities as the result of being  caught  smuggling  goods  over  the
    border for the Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran (KDPI).  At the hearing
    in the First-tier Tribunal, the appellant's  case  (Counsel's  skeleton
    argument, paragraph 3).was that "due to being Kurdish and smuggling for
    the KDPI he would be at risk and he may also be  considered  a  blogger
    due to his Facebook account."

The Reasons for the Grant of Permission to Appeal

 3. On 2 November 2017, First-tier Tribunal Judge Doyle granted  permission
    to appeal for the following reasons:

         4.  The grounds of appeal argue  that  the  Judge  failed  to  take
         account of relevant case law and  that  the  Judge's  treatment  of
         expert evidence is flawed.

         5.  The Judge does not take  guidance  from  BA  (Demonstrators  in
         Britain - risk on return) Iran CG [2011]  UKUT  36  (IAC).   It  is
         arguable that he should have.  At [31] the  Judge  considers  three
         expert reports.  No analysis of the reports is carried out.  It  is
         arguable that the Judge should have explained in more detail why he
         did not find those reports to be either helpful or persuasive.

Relevant Background

 4. The appellant is a national of Iran, whose date of birth is 11 November
    1992.  He arrived in the United Kingdom on  18  May  2016  and  claimed
    asylum on the same day.  He was interviewed about his asylum claim on 4
    November 2016.

 5. He said that  from  the  age  of  16  he  started  work  as  a  Kolbar,
    transporting goods over the border as a means  of  earning  money.   He
    used to pay a bribe to a person, "AC", who worked for Etelaat, in order
    that the authorities did not confiscate the goods that he  transported.
    Members of the KDPI became aware of this,  and  accused  him  of  being
    involved with the Government.  However, they accepted  the  appellant's
    explanation and he agreed to transport goods for the KDPI.  He did  not
    join the KDPI - he just helped  them  by  transporting  goods  such  as
    clothes, shoes, pliers and other tools.  He helped them out of fear.

 6. One night he was taking goods to  the  KDPI,  but  he  came  across  an
    ambush.  He left his horse and ran away.  He did not return to his home
    village, but he went to another village where he had a friend.  When he
    got there, his friend contacted  AC  who  wanted  to  arrest  him  (the
    appellant).  It was within a few hours of his arrival at  his  friend's
    house that he embarked upon his journey out of the  country,  beginning
    with him travelling over the border into Turkey.

 7. On 8 November 2016, the respondent gave her  reasons  for  refusing  to
    recognise the appellant as a refugee.  His account of  having  problems
    with the Iranian authorities was rejected as there were inconsistencies
    in his account, and it ran counter to the background evidence.  He  had
    not provided an account of transporting any KDPI-related materials.  It
    was unclear how the Iranian authorities could have found  that  he  was
    working for the KDPI merely because  he  had  left  behind  his  horse,
    clothes and nail clippers when the Iranian authorities had ambushed his
    smuggling trip.  Additionally, it was unclear why he had run away  from
    the Iranian authorities before illegally exiting the  country  when  he
    was transporting goods that were not illegal.

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 8. The appellant's appeal came before Judge Parker sitting at Stoke on  10
    July 2017.  Both parties were legally represented.  The Judge  received
    oral evidence from the appellant.  He adopted as his evidence in  chief
    his witness statement, in which he said (at paragraph  10)  that  since
    arriving in the UK he had continued to associate himself with the KDPI.
     He had set up a Facebook page on which he pledged support for the KDPI
    and their activities in Iran.  He also posted information  calling  for
    an end to executions of Iranian opposition political prisoners.

 9. At P1-P15, there were exhibited a series of posts - 15 in  total  -  on
    the appellant's Facebook page between 31 May 2016 and 16 December 2016.
     In these posts, the appellant  uploaded  or  shared  photographs,  and
    occasionally videos, with short commentaries.

10. For example, on 2 December 2016, the appellant shared a photograph  and
    wrote the following comment (as translated): "The falcon  which  always
    flies on Kurdistan's sky of freedom.  Salutes to the soul of the leader
    Ghassmlou."   Another  example  is  that,  on  19  November  2016,  the
    appellant added 8 new photographs and wrote the following  comment  (in
    translation): "On 19/11/2016 Trafalgar Square in London condemning  the
    Iranian Government which executed 30,000 people since 1988."

11. In the Appellant's Bundle B there were  three  generic  expert  reports
    from Professor Joffe  on  the  topic  of  whether  Kurds  in  Iran  are
    routinely persecuted by the Iranian authorities.  Professor  Joffe  has
    consistently maintained that this is the case.

12. The first two reports  were  dated  15  October  2014  and  March  2016
    respectively, and they preceded the Country Guidance case of SSH  &  HR
    (Illegal exit: failed asylum seeker) Iran CG [2016]  UKUT  00308  (IAC)
    which was heard at Field House on 10 May 2016.

13. The third report was dated 26 August 2016.  In this  report,  Professor
    Joffe acknowledged that the Upper Tribunal had taken a  different  view
    from him in their recent Country Guidance decision.  But in his opinion
    the Upper Tribunal was wrong.

14. In his subsequent decision, the Judge gave his  reasons  for  rejecting
    the appellant's  core  claim  at  paragraphs  [14]-[25].   His  reasons
    included the fact that the appellant had  a  lack  of  basic  knowledge
    regarding the KDPI, as revealed by his asylum and screening interviews.



15.  At  paragraphs  [26]-[31],  the  Judge  addressed  the  issue  of  the
    appellant's Facebook activities.  He began by referring to the  Country
    Guidance in BA.  He then considered the guidance given by the  Tribunal
    in SB (Risk on return - illegal exit) Iran CG [2009]  UKAIT  0053.   At
    paragraph [30], the Judge said: "The  appellant  is  not  known  to  be
    politically active.  He has  been  found  not  credible  regarding  his
    claims.  The mere posting of anti-Government act  on  a  Facebook  page
    does not give him a risk profile."

16. At paragraph [31], the Judge addressed the three reports from Professor
    Joffe.  He noted the expert's conclusion, at paragraph 46 of  his  2014
    report, that there was a risk of persecution "merely  because  you  are
    Kurdish on return."  He noted  that  Professor  Joffe  had  provided  a
    report dated 26 August 2016 which attempted to deal  with  the  Country
    Guidance case of SSH & HR, and its conclusion  regarding  illegal  exit
    and the risk of persecution for being Kurdish.   The  Judge  continued:
    "However at paragraph 47 of SSH  &  HR  (Illegal  exit:  failed  asylum
    seeker) Iran CG [2016] UKUT 00308 (IAC) it quotes from another  expert,
    Dr Khakhi [that] merely being a Kurdish  citizen  does  not  of  itself
    result in persecution but can, combined  with  other  factors  such  as
    criminality."

17. At paragraph [32], the Judge cited the Headnote Guidance given in SSH &
    HR that an Iranian male who it was sought to return to  Iran,  and  who
    does not possess a passport, "will be returnable on a  laissez  passer,
    which he can obtain from the Iranian Embassy on proof of  identity  and
    nationality".

18. The Judge held,  at  paragraph  [33],  that  the  mere  fact  that  the
    appellant had left illegally and would  have  to  obtain  documentation
    from the Iranian authorities, did  not  mean  that  there  was  a  risk
    profile for him on return.  The Judge held, at paragraph [34], that the
    appellant would return as  a  person  who  had  no  problems  with  the
    authorities, and so he did not have a risk profile.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

19. At the hearing before me to determine whether an error of law was  made
    out, Ms  Santamera  (who  did  not  appear  below)  expanded  upon  the
    arguments advanced in the application for permission  to  appeal.   She
    acknowledged that AB was not a Country Guidance case, and that at least
    one of the appellants in AB had a higher  internet  profile  than  this
    appellant.  However,  she  submitted  that  the  Judge  had  not  given
    adequate reasons for holding  that  the  postings  on  the  appellant's
    Facebook page could  not  have  come  to  the  notice  of  the  Iranian
    authorities, or would not have engendered a risk for him at  the  pinch
    point of return.

20. With respect to the expert evidence of Professor Joffe,  she  submitted
    that the Judge had erred in not engaging with Professor Joffe's reasons
    for opining that the Upper Tribunal in the Country  Guidance  case  had
    wrongly discounted an enhanced risk for failed asylum seekers who  were
    Kurdish.

21. In reply, Mr Mills submitted  that  the  reasoning  of  the  Judge  was
    adequate, given the highly skeletal nature of the case which  had  been
    put forward in Counsel's skeleton argument for the hearing in the First-
    tier Tribunal.

Discussion

22. There are two grounds of appeal.  The first is that the Judge failed to
    take into account "the more relevant case" of  AB  &  Others  (Internet
    activity - state of evidence) Iran [2015] UKUT  00257  when  addressing
    the issue of the appellant's Facebook activities. The second ground  is
    that the Judge failed to give sufficient  reasons  for  departing  from
    Professor Joffe's expert opinion.

23. Judge Doyle granted permission on the  first  ground  on  an  erroneous
    basis.  He granted permission on the ground that the Judge  had  failed
    to consider the Country Guidance case of BA.  This is plainly wrong.

24. The actual complaint in Ground 1  is  not  that  the  Judge  failed  to
    consider relevant Country Guidance cases, but that  he  also  ought  to
    have considered "the more relevant case" of AB  &  Others  -  although,
    which the permission application fails to acknowledge, this  is  not  a
    Country Guidance case.

25. The headnote of AB reads as follows:

       "The material put before the Tribunal did not disclose a  sufficient
       evidential basis for giving Country or  other  Guidance  upon  what,
       reliably, can be expected in terms of reception in  Iran  for  those
       returning otherwise than with a "regular" passport  in  relation  to
       whom interest may be excited  from  the  authorities  into  internet
       activity as might be revealed by an examination of blogging activity
       or a Facebook account."

26. At paragraph [453], the  Tribunal  accepted  that  some  monitoring  of
    activities outside Iran is possible and that it occurs.  But they  were
    not able to say what circumstances, if any, enhanced  or  diluted  that
    risk.  At paragraph [460], the Tribunal said:

       "Overall, it is very difficult to make any sensible  findings  about
       anything that converts a technical possibility  of  something  being
       discovered into a real risk of it being  discovered...We  find  that
       our main concern is the pinch point of return."

27. At paragraph [461], the Tribunal held that the more active  the  person
    has been on the internet, the more likely the authorities would  become
    interested and pursue  their  investigations  at  the  pinch  point  of
    return.

28. The Judge was not apparently provided with a copy of AB.  In  addition,
    Counsel for the appellant did not  advance  a  case,  by  reference  to
    specific passages in AB, that either (a) the nature and extent  of  the
    appellant's political activity on his Facebook  page  was  such  as  to
    engender a real risk that he would have come to the  attention  of  the
    Iranian authorities as a political activist in the UK; or  (b)  a  case
    that there was a real risk of the authorities  finding  anti-Government
    material on his Facebook page at the pinch point of return.

29. Moreover, insofar as AB  can  be  treated  as  providing  some  general
    guidance  on  the  potential  risk  generated   by   online   political
    activities, on analysis its guidance is not materially  different  from
    that given in the headnote guidance of BA, which is cited at  paragraph
    [28] of the Judge's decision.  Although the guidance given in BA is not
    directed at bloggers, it covers political activists whose participation
    in demonstrations is publicised  on  the  internet  -  for  example  on
    Facebook.

30. On the evidence available to the Judge, the appellant's  postings  were
    transient and often oblique in terms of their support for the  KDPI  or
    criticism of the  Iranian  Government.   There  was  also  no  specific
    evidence of the appellant continuing to  post  photographs  with  anti-
    Government comments on his Facebook page in the  six  to  seven  months
    leading up to the appeal hearing.

31. Against this background, it was open to the  Judge  to  find  that  the
    appellant had not shown substantial grounds for believing that  he  had
    acquired a risk profile on account of the postings which he had made on
    his Facebook page.  Accordingly, Ground 1 falls away.

32. Turing to Ground  2,  the  error  of  law  challenge  advanced  in  the
    permission application proceeds on the premise that SSH &  HR  did  not
    specifically address the risk on return for failed asylum  seekers  who
    had exited Iran illegally and who were also of Kurdish ethnicity.  This
    premise is incorrect.

33. The guidance given in SSH and HR in the headnote and at paragraph  [33]
    is as follows:

         "(a) An Iranian male who it is sought to return to Iran,  who  does
         not possess a passport, will be returnable  on  a  laissez  passer,
         which he can obtain from the Iranian Embassy on proof  of  identity
         and nationality;

         (b) an Iranian male in respect of  whom  no  adverse  interest  has
         previously been manifested by the Iranian state, does  not  face  a
         real risk of persecution/breach of his Article 3 rights  on  return
         to Iran on account of having left Iran  illegally  and/or  being  a
         failed  asylum  seeker.   No  such  risk  exists  at  the  time  of
         questioning on return to Iran, nor after the facts (i.e. of illegal
         exit and being a failed asylum seeker) have been  established.   In
         particular, there is no a  real  risk  of  prosecution  leading  to
         imprisonment."

34. The two claimants in the  Country  Guidance  case  were  Kurds.  As  is
    apparent from paragraph [45] of Appendix 1 to the decision, their legal
    representatives relied on their Kurdish ethnicity as an additional risk
    factor.  At paragraph [47] of Appendix 1, the Tribunal  summarised  the
    thrust of the expert evidence as follows:

       "The examples  contained  in  Dr  Kakhki's  report  in  relation  to
       imprisonment, torture and execution relate to  individuals  who  are
       reported to be  political  or  civil  activists  or  who  have  been
       convicted of other offences including  national  security  offences.
       The inference which Dr Kakhiki seeks to  draw  from  those  is  that
       being a Kurd does not in itself does not result in  prosecution  but
       when combined with other criminal suspicions, persecution "is likely
       to surface"."

35. After summarising their conclusions on the country guidance  issues  in
    paragraph [33], the Tribunal  continued  in  paragraph  [34]  of  their
    decision as follows:

        "It was not suggested to us that an individual faces risk on  return
        on the sole basis of being Kurdish.  It was,  however,  agreed  that
        being Kurdish was relevant to how a returnee would be treated by the
        authorities.  For example, the Operation  Guidance  note  refers  at
        3.12.14 to  the  Government  disproportionately  targeting  minority
        groups including Kurds, for arbitrary arrests,  prolonged  detention
        and physical abuse.  No examples, however, have been provided of ill-
        treatment of returnees with no  relevant  adverse  interest  factors
        other than  their  Kurdish  ethnicity,  and  we  conclude  that  the
        evidence does not show risk  of  ill-treatment  of  such  returnees,
        though we accept that it might  be  an  exacerbating  factor  for  a
        returnee otherwise of interest.  Accordingly, we  conclude  that  it
        has not been shown that a person in the position of these appellants
        faces a real risk on return to Iran either  on  the  basis  of  what
        would happen to them when questioned at the airport or  subsequently
        if they were convicted of an offence of illegal exit."

36. Accordingly, Judge Parker was right to treat the Country Guidance  case
    as applying to the appellant, and he was right  to  treat  the  Country
    Guidance case as authoritative on the issue of the risk on return faced
    by the appellant, insofar as his appeal  (a)  related  to  the  country
    guidance issue in question (which it clearly did) and (b) was dependent
    upon the same or similar evidence  as  that  considered  by  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

37. The permission application quotes  verbatim  from  the  conclusions  of
    Professor Joffe's report of 15 October 2014.  It states that he  sought
    to amass  evidence  that  the  Iranian  regime  severely  discriminates
    against its Kurdish minority, simply because they are Kurdish; and that
    he has shown that such discrimination is so severe that it  amounts  to
    persecution.  When they are returned to Iran as failed asylum  seekers,
    "they face serious and  real  threats  to  their  personal  safety  and
    security as a result, as the Irish Refugee Documentation  Centre  noted
    in early January 2012."

38. With respect to the case advanced in the  permission  application,  the
    simply riposte is that, in their subsequent Country Guidance  decision,
    the Upper Tribunal reached a different conclusion on the same  evidence
    up to 2014 - and also on the  background  evidence  in  the  two  years
    between 2014 and 2016 - and so the Judge did not have to explain why he
    was following the Country Guidance authority, rather than  paying  heed
    to Professor Joffe's contrary opinion.

39. Ms Santamera took a different line in oral submissions, asserting  that
    the Judge's error of law lay not in his failure to address  the  expert
    reports of Professor Joffe which preceded SSH & HR, but in his  failure
    to engage adequately with the expert report which came afterwards -  in
    particular Professor Joffe's evidence as to why the Upper Tribunal  had
    underestimated the risk for a Kurdish failed asylum seeker in  applying
    for a laissez passer.

40. Not only is this case not pleaded in the grounds of appeal to the Upper
    Tribunal, but it was also not advanced by Counsel at the hearing in the
    First-tier Tribunal.  It appears that the Judge  was  simply  presented
    with the three expert reports of Professor Joffe and  that  no  attempt
    was made by Counsel to persuade the Judge, by reference  to  the  third
    report of Professor Joffe, that the findings in the Upper Tribunal were
    wrong insofar as they applied to Kurds.

41. I consider that the Judge adequately  addressed  the  (erroneous)  case
    which was put to him, which was that SSH  &  HR  did  not  specifically
    address the risk faced by failed Kurdish asylum seekers who had  exited
    Iran illegally. In fact it did so, as the Judge held at paragraph [31].

42. There was no error of law in the Judge failing to explain why Professor
    Joff�'s observations about the  laissez  passer  did  not  advance  the
    appellant's case.  It is apparent from the Country Guidance case, which
    the Judge adopts, that the expert's criticism of the  Upper  Tribunal's
    findings on this issue does not have any merit.  At paragraph [23]  the
    Tribunal found as follows:

       "In this regard, it is relevant return to Dr Kakhki's evidence in re-
       examination where he said the treatment  they  would  receive  would
       depend on their individual case.  If they  cooperated  and  accepted
       that they left illegally and claimed asylum abroad, then there would
       be no reason for ill-treatment,  and  questioning  would  be  for  a
       fairly brief period.  That seems to us to sum up the position  well,
       and as a consequence we conclude that a person of no  history  other
       than that of being a failed asylum seeker who had  exited  illegally
       and who could be expected to tell the truth when  questioned,  would
       not  face  a  real  risk  of  ill-treatment  during  the  period  of
       questioning at the airport.  We should add that we have no reason to
       doubt Dr Kakhki's evidence that there is a special Court at or  near
       the airport which considers the cases of returnees, but the evidence
       does not show a real risk of ill-treatment in breach  of  Article  3
       amounting to persecution  as  a  consequence  of  attending  at  the
       Court."

43. The significance of  this  finding  by  the  Tribunal  is  that  it  is
    irrelevant that one of the requirements for obtaining a laissez  passer
    from the Iranian Embassy is a letter from the  Home  Office  confirming
    that an application for asylum in Britain has been made, or a photocopy
    of a residence permit, as Professor Joff� says is the case in paragraph
    30 of his third report.  For  the  Tribunal's  assessment  of  risk  on
    return assumes that the Iranian authorities  will  obtain  confirmation
    that the bearer of the laissez passer is a failed  asylum  seeker  when
    the bearer is questioned on arrival.  So the bearer of a laisser-passer
    will not be potentially endangered by having to declare to the  Iranian
    embassy in the UK the same information which  he  can  be  expected  to
    declare on arrival in Iran, namely that he is a failed asylum seeker.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not contain  an  error  of  law,
and accordingly the decision stands.

This appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.
