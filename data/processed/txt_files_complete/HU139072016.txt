Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr I Jarvis, Home Office Presenting Officer (16
August 2017).

For the Respondent:    Mr J Markus, Counsel, instructed by Paragon Law.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge P J M Hollingworth) allowing  an  appeal  by
    the appellant against the  decision  dated  7  May  2016  refusing  his
    application for leave to remain on human rights grounds.   Following  a
    hearing on 16 August 2017 the  Tribunal  (The  Honourable  Lord  Burns,
    sitting as a Judge of the Upper  Tribunal  and  Deputy  Upper  Tribunal
    Judge Latter) found that the First-tier Tribunal erred in law such that
    the decision should be set aside as follows. In this decision, we  will
    refer to the parties as they were before the First-tier  Tribunal,  the
    applicant  as  the  appellant  and  the  Secretary  of  State  as   the
    respondent.

Background

2.   The background to this appeal can briefly  be  summarised  as  follows.
    The appellant is a citizen of The Gambia born on 1 November  1979.   He
    first entered the UK on 27 July 2002 with entry clearance as a  husband
    following his marriage on 3 May 2002 to a British national.  On 28 July
    2003, he was granted indefinite leave to  remain  on  the  same  basis.
    Subsequently,  they  separated  and  the  appellant  entered   into   a
    relationship with his present partner.  There are three children of the
    family, born on 11 November 2005, 20 August 2015 and 8 September  2016,
    respectively.  The appellant and his partner were married on 11 January
    2013.

3.   The appellant has been convicted of a number of criminal  offences  all
    involving drugs.  On 11 October 2005, he was  convicted  at  Derby  and
    South Derbyshire Magistrates' Court of possessing a class C  controlled
    drug and fined �80.  In June 2006, he appeared at Derby Crown Court  on
    two counts of possession with intent to supply  a  class  C  controlled
    drug and sentenced  to  28  days'  imprisonment  suspended  for  twelve
    months.  On 5 December 2008, he was convicted at Derby Crown  Court  of
    two counts of possessing controlled Class A drugs with intent to supply
    and possessing class C controlled drugs and on 6 February 2009  he  was
    sentenced to a total of four years' imprisonment.

4.   Subsequently, he was advised of his  liability  to  deportation  and  a
    deportation order was signed on 10 May 2010.   The  appellant  appealed
    against this decision.  His appeal was dismissed on 18 August 2010  and
    permission to appeal was refused.  On 27  September  2010,  his  appeal
    rights were exhausted and at that point the deportation order came into
    force which automatically revoked his indefinite leave to remain.

5.   Further representations were made on the appellant's behalf leading  to
    a decision on 1 February 2012 refusing to revoke the deportation order.
     He appealed against this decision and his appeal was  allowed  by  the
    First-tier Tribunal in a decision issued on 17 April 2012.   The  panel
    said that it was satisfied "just  on  balance"  that  the  decision  to
    refuse to revoke the deportation order did not represent  a  necessary,
    proportionate and fair balance between the right  to  respect  for  the
    family life of the appellant and his child and  the  particular  public
    interest  in  question.   Following  the  appeal  being  allowed,   the
    appellant was granted two periods of six months' discretionary leave.

6.    On  22  April  2015,  the  appellant  appeared  at  South   Derbyshire
    Magistrates' Court and was convicted of possessing a controlled class B
    drug, cannabis/cannabis resin and was fined �99.  On 26 May 2015, again
    at South Derbyshire Magistrates' Court, he was convicted of  possessing
    a controlled class B drug,  cannabis/cannabis  resin,  and  failing  to
    surrender to custody and on 3 June 2015 he received a community  order,
    a victim surcharge, a  rehabilitation  activity  requirement,  a  court
    charge and a fine.  An order was  also  made  for  the  forfeiture  and
    destruction of the drugs.

7.   Following these convictions, on 7 December 2015 the respondent  made  a
    fresh  decision  to  deport  the  appellant  who  then   made   further
    representations for leave to remain on human rights grounds.

The Hearing before the First-tier Tribunal

8.   At  the  hearing  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  the  judge  heard
    evidence from both the appellant and his wife.  He was provided with an
    independent  social  worker's  report  dated  30  November  2016.    He
    considered the best interests of the children and so far as the  eldest
    son was concerned, he found that it  was  unquestionably  in  his  best
    interests that he remained in the UK  with  both  parents.   The  judge
    referred to HC 395 as amended ("the Rules") saying at [60]:

         "In assessing the claim the respondent considers whether  paragraph
         399 or 399A applies.   If  it  does  not  the  public  interest  in
         deportation will only be outweighed by other  factors  where  there
         are very compelling circumstances over and above those described in
         paragraphs 399 and 399A."

9.    The  judge  then  went  on  to  consider  the  position  both  of  the
    appellant's wife and his children.  He found  that  relocation  to  The
    Gambia was not feasible [67],  in  particular  because  of  his  wife's
    medical condition  with  multiple  sclerosis.   He  considered  whether
    Exception 1 or 2 applied as  set  out  in  s.117C(4)  and  (5)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  ("the  2002  Act")  and
    whether the effect of the appellant's deportation  on  his  partner  or
    children would be unduly harsh.  He directed himself as follows:

         "70. In considering whether the effect would be unduly harsh, it is
             clearly necessary to consider the extent to which  the  public
             interest requires the appellant's  removal.   The  appellant's
             immigration and criminal  history  must  be  considered.   The
             respondent has set out the immigration history.  The  view  of
             the panel in 2012 was that, just on balance, the  decision  to
             refuse to revoke the deportation order, did  not  represent  a
             necessary, proportionate and a fair balance between the rights
             to respect for the family life of the appellant and the  child
             and the particular public interest in question."

10.  The judge then referred to the changes in the  appellant's  life  since
    2012 and said that in the light of those developments, he  had  reached
    the conclusion that the fine balance identified by the  panel  in  2012
    remained as finely poised as it was  found  to  be  then  and  just  on
    balance  enabled  the  conclusion  to  be  reached  that  it  would  be
    disproportionate for the appellant to be  removed  [72].   Accordingly,
    the appeal was allowed.



The Grounds and Submissions

11.  In the respondent's grounds of appeal it is argued that the  First-tier
    Tribunal erred in law by applying the unduly  harsh  test  outlined  in
    para 399(a) and (b) of the Rules and s.117C(3) - (5) of the 2002 Act as
    the  appellant  had  been  sentenced  to  a  period  of   four   years'
    imprisonment and  therefore  fell  outside  those  provisions.   It  is
    further argued that the judge failed to identify the  "very  compelling
    circumstances" over and above those contained in s.117C(3) -  (5)  that
    are required to outweigh the public interest  under  s.117C(6)  of  the
    2002 Act.

12.  In his submissions Mr Jarvis accepted that there was a degree  of  lack
    of clarity in the respondent's grounds but  they  did  make  clear  the
    substance of the argument that the judge had erred in law  by  deciding
    the appeal by applying a test of undue harshness but had failed then to
    consider whether there were  very  compelling  circumstances  over  and
    above those described in paras 399 and  399A  to  outweigh  the  public
    interest in deportation.

13.  Mr Markus submitted that the judge had been aware of  the  proper  test
    to be applied under the Rules: he had referred to it in [60].   He  had
    been entitled to consider  the  issue  of  undue  harshness  which  was
    clearly relevant to the assessment of proportionality.   There  was  no
    requirement to recite any particular form of words  or  mantra  of  the
    moment: Secretary of State v DB (Jamaica) [2017] EWCA Civ 440 at  [22].
    He submitted that the judge clearly understood the weight of the public
    interest and that, when the decision was read as  a  whole,  there  was
    clear support for his conclusions.  He conceded that  the  judge  could
    have set out the matter more clearly  but,  nonetheless,  he  had  been
    aware that the appellant's claim fell within para 398(a) of the  Rules.
    He had considered all the relevant matters and had reached  a  decision
    open to him.

Consideration of whether the Judge erred in Law

14.  It is common ground between  the  parties  that  when  considering  the
    appellant's appeal under the Rules, he falls within the  provisions  of
    para 398(a), which reads as follows:

         "(a) The deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to  the
             public good and in the public interest because they have  been
             convicted of an offence for which they have been sentenced  to
             a period of imprisonment of at least four years."

    The provisions of para 399 do not apply to the appellant as  they  only
    apply to those falling within paras 398(b) or (c).  Paragraph 398  then
    provides  that  "the  public  interest  in  deportation  will  only  be
    outweighed  by  other  factors  where   there   are   very   compelling
    circumstances over and above those described in paras 399 and 399A".


15.  This wording replaced with  effect  from  28  July  2014  the  previous
    wording in force from 9 July 2012 that, where the  provisions  of  para
    399  or  399A  did  not  apply,  "it  will  only  be   in   exceptional
    circumstances  that  the  public  interest  in  deportation   will   be
    outweighed by other factors."  In any event, it  was  accepted  at  the
    hearing before us that the  July  2012  Rules  did  not  apply  to  the
    appellant's previous appeal in  2012  in  the  light  of  the  date  of
    decision.   That  Tribunal  was  therefore  considering  the   position
    generally under article 8 without reference to the  amendments  to  the
    Rules in force from 9 July 2012.   The  judge  in  the  present  appeal
    therefore had to consider whether there were  compelling  circumstances
    over and above those set out in paras 399  and  399A  to  outweigh  the
    public interest in deportation.

16.  The judge found that the children could not be expected  to  leave  the
    UK given that it was in the interests of the  oldest  child  to  remain
    and, taking that approach, his mother must remain with him  [62].   The
    relationship between the appellant and his older son had deepened since
    the previous decision.  He found that  the  relocation  of  the  entire
    family to The Gambia was not feasible, taking  into  account  the  fact
    that  the  appellant's  wife's   multiple   sclerosis   symptoms   were
    unpredictable.  Her future was uncertain and relapses  could  occur  at
    any time [66].  He found that the consequence of her condition was that
    the appellant had become  the  primary  carer  for  the  children.   He
    repeated that relocation to The Gambia was not feasible for her  or  an
    option because of her medical conditions [67].

17.  He went on to consider s.117, finding that the appellant had a  genuine
    and subsisting relationship with his eldest child [69].  He  said  that
    when considering whether the effect of removal would be  unduly  harsh,
    it was necessary to consider the extent to which  the  public  interest
    required the appellant's removal.  He took into account that since  the
    previous decision the appellant had committed two further offences, the
    second attracting a community sentence  and  that  the  respondent  had
    correctly identified the need for  deterrence.   There  was  clearly  a
    concern  as  to  whether  the  appellant  had  or  had   not   achieved
    rehabilitation and the nature of drugs offending had to  be  considered
    with  its  effect  upon  society.   The  progressive  nature   of   the
    appellant's wife's condition must be taken into account and the  effect
    upon the eldest child of his father's removal must be assessed in  that
    light.  The judge concluded in [72] that the fine balance identified by
    the panel in 2012 remained as finely poised as it was then and just  on
    balance  enabled  the  conclusion  to  be  reached  that  it  would  be
    disproportionate for the appellant to be removed.

18.  We accept that the judge referred to the correct test in  [60]  but  we
    can find nothing in his reasons or in his reasoning to indicate that he
    gave proper weight to the requirement both in the Rules at para 398 and
    in s.117C(6) of the 2002 Act that in the case of a person sentenced  to
    a period of imprisonment of four years or more there  had  to  be  very
    compelling circumstances over and above those described in para 398  or
    in Exceptions 1 and  2  of  the  2002  Act,  respectively.   The  judge
    referred to very compelling circumstances in [60] but there is  nothing
    further to indicate that he applied that test.  We do  not  accept  the
    submission  that  the  paragraphs  following  on  from  [60]  are   his
    assessment of whether there were circumstances  going  over  and  above
    those set out in the relevant provisions in the Rules and the  statute.



19.  These paragraphs do not set out  any  proper  basis  on  which  it  can
    reasonably be inferred that the judge was  satisfied  that  there  were
    very compelling circumstances or that he was applying the test  as  set
    out in para 398 or s.117C(6).  The language used by the judge  in  [72]
    that the decision remained as finely poised as it was found  to  be  in
    2012 indicates to us that the judge was not making an assessment  based
    on whether there were such very compelling circumstances.  The language
    he used is inconsistent with such an approach.

20.  It was submitted that there was no  requirement  for  the  decision  to
    recite any particular "form of words or  mantra  of  the  moment".   We
    entirely agree that it is not necessary to use any particular  form  of
    words, still less the mantra of the moment, but in Secretary of State v
    DB (Jamaica), the comments of Irwin LJ were preceded by a finding  that
    the particular decision under appeal had  been  conducted  "within  the
    confines of a careful self-direction and with a proper  recognition  of
    the great weight placed in the public interest on  the  deportation  of
    foreign criminals".  We are not satisfied  that  in  the  present  case
    there has been such a careful self-direction or  that  there  has  been
    proper consideration of the requirement in the current Rules that there
    must be very compelling circumstances over and above those set  out  in
    the provisions to which we have already referred.  The reference to the
    fact that the position remained as finely poised as it was found to  be
    in 2012 fails to take account of the fact  that  there  have  been  two
    changes in the Rules and the introduction of new  statutory  provisions
    in s.117A - D which required the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  apply  very
    different provisions from those in force at the date  of  the  previous
    decision.

21.  The Supreme Court in Hesham Ali (Iraq)  v  Secretary  of  State  [2016]
    UKSC 60 has made it clear that, even if  the  appellant  did  not  fall
    within the provisions of the Rules, there has to be  an  assessment  of
    article 8 but in that context,  where  the  respondent  had  adopted  a
    policy based on a general assessment  of  proportionality,  a  Tribunal
    should attach considerable weight to that assessment and in  particular
    that a custodial sentence of four years  or  more  represented  such  a
    serious level of offending that the public interest in  the  offender's
    deportation almost always outweighed countervailing  considerations  of
    private or family life and that where the circumstances  did  not  fall
    within Rules 399 or 399A, the public interest  in  the  deportation  of
    such offenders could generally be  outweighed  only  by  countervailing
    factors which were very compelling: per Lord Reed at [46].

22.  In summary, we are not satisfied that the First-tier Tribunal gave  any
    or any proper consideration to the requirement both  within  the  Rules
    and generally  under  article  8  that  there  must  be  countervailing
    considerations of a very  compelling  nature  to  outweigh  the  public
    interest  in  the  deportation  of  those  sentenced  to   periods   of
    imprisonment of four years or more.  For these reasons, the judge erred
    in law and the decision must be set aside.

23.  Both representatives submitted that if the decision was set aside,  the
    better course would be for the appeal  to  be  retained  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal for the decision to be re-made.  We are satisfied that this is
    the right course to take.

24.  The hearing was resumed before me on 25 January  2018.   The  appellant
   filed two further witness statements dated 11 and 24  January  2018  and
   one by his wife dated 10 January 2018.   He  relied  on  the  bundle  of
   documents (A) before the First-tier Tribunal indexed  and  paginated  1-
   351.  It was agreed that there was no need for further oral evidence and
   that the resumed hearing could proceed by way of oral submissions only.

Further Submissions

25.  Mr Markus submitted that the First-tier Tribunal had accepted that  the
    requirements of para 399 (a) and (b) of the Rules were met and that the
    issue was whether the public interest in deportation was outweighed  by
    other factors where there are very compelling  circumstances  over  and
    above those set out in para  399  and  399A.   He  accepted  that  when
    assessing article 8 the provisions of part 5A of the 2002 Act had to be
    considered but  the  balancing  exercise  remained  a  matter  for  the
    Tribunal.

26   He submitted that the proper starting point for the assessment  of  the
    appeal was the Tribunal decision of 17 April 2012 and that any  changes
    of  circumstances  should  then  be  considered.   The  appellant   had
    committed further offences since his release from prison but  he  could
    not be described, so he argued, as a recidivist in the  true  sense  of
    the word.  His subsequent convictions were minor offences.  The  First-
    tier  Tribunal  had  accepted  the  appellant's  explanation  for   his
    possession of drugs and the most recent offence,  driving  with  excess
    alcohol, could properly be considered as on unfortunate mistake on  the
    appellant's part.  They did not show him as a  hardened  criminal.   He
    had tried to reform but he accepted that he  had  made  some  mistakes.
    Overall, he posed no real risk to the public.

27.   He  submitted  that  there  had  been  further  developments  in   the
    appellant's family life which  had  the  effect  of  strengthening  his
    article  8  claim.   He  had  married  his  partner  and  was  formally
    registered as her carer.  He received the  carer's  allowance  and  the
    family was in receipt of various  benefits.   His  wife's  illness  has
    progressed since 2012 and he was the primary carer of the children.  If
    he had to leave the UK,  the  family  would  fall  apart.   The  public
    interest in the appellant's deportation  had  been  diminished  by  the
    passage of time.  It was 10 years since  the  index  offence  had  been
    committed.  The best interests of the children were  clear,  that  they
    remain with their parents in the  UK.   In  the  light  of  his  wife's
    disability his  deportation  would  be  disastrous  for  her.   It  was
    difficult to see, so he submitted, how things could  be  worse  in  the
    light of her degenerative disease.

28.      Mr Tufan submitted that  the  substantive  issue  was  whether  the
    appellant could meet the test in section 117C(6) of showing that  there
    were very compelling circumstances over and above  those  described  in
    exceptions 1 and 2 (reflecting the provisions of para 399(a) and  (b)).
    The issue was whether the factual matrix in the  present  case  brought
    the appellant within one of those rare cases where there were such very
    compelling circumstances.  He submitted that this  was  not  the  case.
    His wife's condition was not life threatening at this stage.  There was
    evidence that her mother and sister could provide support  and  further
    support would be available from social  services.   The  appellant  had
    committed very serious offences and had received  a  sentence  of  four
    years.  It was significant that two later offences related to drugs and
    the offence of drink-driving could not be dismissed as a minor  matter.
    There was a pattern of re-offending.  Even if he was not a  recidivist,
    he could properly be described as a repeat offender.

29.  In reply, Mr Markus submitted that the more recent  offences  had  been
    caused by the pressure the appellant had been under and were not likely
    to  be  repeated.   Whilst  his  wife's  condition  may  not  be  life-
    threatening, it was life-limiting and degenerative.  She would  not  be
    able to look after herself and the family without him  and  her  mother
    and sister would only be able  to  help  in  a  limited  way.   It  was
    difficult to see, so he argued, how social services could  step  in  to
    provide the sort of care the appellant was providing.   If  the  appeal
    was allowed, he invited me to make observations, even though I  had  no
    power to give directions, as to the period of leave to be granted as at
    present it  was  virtually  impossible  for  the  appellant  to  obtain
    employment because he was only granted short periods of leave.

Assessment of the Issues

30.  It is not in issue  between  the  parties  that  when  considering  the
    appeal under the Rules, the relevant provisions are para 398  and  399.
    The First-tier Tribunal was  satisfied  that  the  provisions  of  para
    399(a) and (b) were met but it did not go on to consider whether  there
    were very compelling circumstances over and above those  provisions  to
    outweigh the public interest in deportation.  In relation to article 8,
    similar provisions to those in paras  399  and  399A  are  set  out  in
    sections 117A-C of  the  2002  Act  as  statutory  considerations  when
    assessing the public interest question.

31   These provisions have been considered in a number of  recent  Court  of
    Appeal decisions.  In NA (Pakistan) v Secretary of  State  [2016]  EWCA
    62, Jackson LJ said at [29]:

         '...The phrase used in section 117C(6), in para. 398  of  the  2014
         rules and which we have held is to be  read  into  section  117C(3)
         does not  mean  that  a  foreign  criminal  facing  deportation  is
         altogether disentitled from seeking  to  rely  on  matters  falling
         within the scope of the circumstances described in Exceptions 1 and
         2  when  seeking  to  contend  that  "there  are  very   compelling
         circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions  1  and
         2". As we have indicated above, a foreign criminal is  entitled  to
         rely upon such matters, but he would need to be able  to  point  to
         features of his case of a kind mentioned in Exceptions 1 and 2 (and
         in paras. 399 or 399A of  the  2014  rules),  or  features  falling
         outside the circumstances described in those Exceptions  and  those
         paragraphs, which made his claim  based  on  Article  8  especially
         strong.'

    and in [37]:

         'In relation to a serious offender it will often be sensible to see
         whether his case involves circumstances described in  Exceptions  1
         and  2,  both  because  the  circumstances  so  described  set  out
         particularly significant factors bearing upon respect  for  private
         life (Exception 1) and respect for family life  (Exception  2)  and
         because that may provide a helpful basis on which an assessment can
         be made as to whether there are "very compelling circumstances over
         and above those described in Exceptions 1 and  2"  as  is  required
         under section 117C(6).  It will then be necessary to  look  to  see
         whether any of the factors within Exceptions 1 and 2  are  of  such
         force whether by themselves or taken in conjunction with any  other
         relevant factors not covered  by  the  circumstances  described  in
         Exceptions 1 and 2, as to satisfy the test set out in section 117 C
         (6).'

32.  In his  judgment,  Jackson  LJ  confirmed  that  whilst  there  was  no
    exceptionality requirement, it inexorably followed from  the  statutory
    scheme  that  cases  in  which  the  circumstances   are   sufficiently
    compelling to outweigh the high public interest in deportation will  be
    rare and that the commonplace incidents of family life such  as  ageing
    parents in poor  health  and  the  natural  love  between  parents  and
    children will not be sufficient [33].  It was also important to bear in
    mind that the best interests of children will carry great weight but it
    was a consequence of criminal conduct that offenders may  be  separated
    from their children for many years, contrary to  their  best  interests
    [34].

33.      In NE-A (Nigeria) v Secretary  of  State  [2017]  EWCA  Civ239  Sir
    Steven Richards after considering the judgment of the Supreme Court  in
    Hesham Ali [2016] UKSC 60 which was dealing with the Rules and not  the
    provisions of Part 5A of the 2002 Act said at [14]:

         '... Part 5A  of  the  2002  by  contrast  is  primary  legislation
         directed to the tribunals and governing  their  decision-making  in
         relation to article 8 claims in the context of  appeals  under  the
         Immigration Acts.  I see no reason to doubt what was common  ground
         in Rhuppiah and was drawn from NA (Pakistan) is that sections 117 A-
         D, taken  together,  are  intended  to  provide  for  a  structured
         approach to the application of article  8  which  produces  in  all
         cases a final result  which  is  compatible  with  article  8.   In
         particular, if in working through the structure one gets to section
         117C(6), the proper application of that provision produces a  final
         result compatible with article 8 in all cases to which it  applies.
         The provision contains more than a statement  of  policy  to  which
         regard must be  had  as  a  relevant  consideration.   Parliament's
         assessment that "the  public  interest  requires  deportation  save
         where there are very compelling circumstances over and above  those
         described in Exceptions 1 and 2" is one to which  the  tribunal  is
         bound by law to give effect.'

34.  As already set out, this appeal is proceeding on  the  basis  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal was satisfied  that  deportation  would  be  unduly
    harsh both in respect of the appellant's wife and his children and that
    the  issue  to  be  assessed  is  whether  there  are  very  compelling
    circumstances over and above those provisions to  outweigh  the  public
    interest in deportation.

35   The judge set out his conclusion in [72] of his decision as follows:

         "In the light of the developments since 2012, helpfully  identified
         by learned counsel both in his skeleton argument and  in  his  oral
         submissions and the effect of those developments, set  against  the
         nature of the appellant's offending, I have reached the  conclusion
         that  the  fine  balance  identified  by  the  panel  in  2012,  as
         identified in judge Shanahan's decision, remains as  finely  poised
         as it was found to be in 2012 and  just  on  balance,  enables  the
         conclusion to be reached that it would be disproportionate for  the
         appellant to be removed."

    This wording strongly suggests to me that, had the judge  followed  the
    approach set out in the judgments referred  to  above,  he  would  have
    found that the provisions of para 398 were not met.   Bearing  in  mind
    that the Tribunal in 2012 was applying the law before the amendments to
    the Rules and the introduction of Part 5A into the  2002  Act,  if  the
    matter was as finely poised as in 2012, it is not easy to see  how  the
    appellant could have met the test of very compelling circumstances.

36.  However, I must assess this issue for myself. In his skeleton  argument
    prepared for the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal and  relied  on
    at this hearing Mr  Markus  identified  the  relevant  changes  in  the
    appellant's circumstances since the 2012 Tribunal decision.  The  first
    relates to the appellant's convictions in  2015.   These  involved  two
    offences of  possessing  Class  B  drugs  leading  to  the  appellant's
    convictions in April and  May  2015.   It  is  argued  that  they  were
    offences of possession only and that, in the  absence  of  the  earlier
    convictions in 2008, they would not warrant deportation action.

37.  The First-tier Tribunal judge  took  into  account  that  the  offences
    related only to possession only  and  that  the  quantities  were  very
    small. He accepted the appellant's  explanation  for  committing  these
    offences: that he was going through a stressful period in his life.  He
    said at [50] that the appellant appreciated that he had jeopardised his
    family life by his offending  and  noted  that  he  had  completed  his
    community order with  no  breaches.   He  took  account  of  the  short
    interval between the two offences as a significant factor in indicating
    that the reason for the offences was as given by the appellant and  the
    fact that he had not reoffended in the  interval  between  his  release
    from prison until December 2014 and that he had  not  reoffended  since
    the conviction in 2015.

38.  However, a third offence has now been committed  as  in  December  2017
    the appellant drove with excess alcohol when he was taking  his  cousin
    home after a visit to the appellant's home.  In his  witness  statement
    dated 24 January 2018, the  appellant  sets  out  his  version  of  the
    circumstances of the offence. It was snowing and he was driving  at  35
    mph in a 40 mph speed limit.  As he travelled around a  bend,  the  car
    started to swerve and he hit the pavement.  The  car  was  damaged  and
    would not start, causing an obstruction in the road.  The  police  were
    contacted because of the obstruction, they attended the scene  and  the
    appellant was breath tested.

39.  He was found to have exceeded the legal limit. He attended court on  16
    January 2018 and pleaded guilty to the offence.  He was fined �210  and
    disqualified for 11 months.  He has no previous  convictions  for  road
    traffic offences.  He says that he did not realise that he had had  too
    much alcohol in his blood as he does not regularly drink alcohol and he
    did not appreciate that  he  would  exceed  the  relevant  limit  after
    drinking one bottle of stout brought by his cousin.

40.  Mr Markus submitted that the appellant could not properly  be  regarded
    as a recidivist in the true sense of the word, which may well be  right
    but, nonetheless, there is a pattern of offending. The  index  offences
    related to supplying and possessing controlled drugs and the  appellant
    who had previous convictions relating to drugs offences has  after  his
    release  from  prison  committed  two  further  offences,  albeit  less
    serious, also relating to possession  of  controlled  drugs.   Further,
    during the course of these proceedings he has committed an  offence  of
    driving with excess alcohol, which, although there is no reason not  to
    accept his account of how it occurred, cannot  be  glossed  over  as  a
    minor offence.  In the OASys report (A99-137) prepared  for  the  index
    offence the appellant was said to present a low  risk  of  reoffending.
    Nonetheless, he has reoffended  three  times  since  that  report.  The
    offences, committed after the Tribunal decision in 2012 describing  the
    proportionality issue as finely balanced, cast real  doubt  on  whether
    appellant is willing or able to stay out of trouble.  By themselves the
    further  offences  may  not  warrant  deportation  but  they  must   be
    considered in the light of the his immigration and criminal history  as
    a whole and they raise real concerns about the appellant's attitude  to
    the law.

41.  The second change of circumstances relied on by the  appellant  relates
    to the developments in his family life since the Tribunal  decision  in
    2012.  It is submitted that they have strengthened his article 8  claim
    in that he and his partner have married, he is formally  registered  as
    his wife's carer and receives carer's allowance, the  family  have  the
    use of a motability car funded through a  disability  living  allowance
    (mobility) award, he has remained in  the  family  home,  their  oldest
    child is progressing well school and there are now two younger children
    of the family born in 2015 and 2016 respectively.  Further, his  wife's
    father who assisted in providing care has sadly  died  and  his  wife's
    condition has progressed since 2012.

42.  In her statements the appellant's wife has  set  out  the  family  care
    carried out by the appellant.  In her letter of 10 February 2014 (A239)
    in support of representations made to the respondent she confirmed that
    the appellant was a much loved and integral part of their  family  life
    and that owing to her suffering from multiple sclerosis  and  arthritis
    in her spine, he was her main carer.  She said that  as  a  loving  and
    supportive father and husband on a daily basis they relied on  him  for
    school runs, homework and liaising with teachers and that  he  attended
    all relevant meetings, appointments and after-school  activities.   She
    also describes him and his son as inseparable.

43.  In her recent witness statement of 11  January  2018,  the  appellant's
    wife refers to the fact that they have a very close family unit and the
    appellant plays a primary care role for her children  as  well  as  for
    herself.  She describes him as having a very  close  relationship  with
    the older child and they are always doing activities and spending time.
     She then says that the appellant has had to step up in  terms  of  his
    childcare in relation together to  the  two  younger  children  as  the
    youngest born in September 2016 requires a lot of attention and demands
    to be picked up a lot of the time and has much greater attention  needs
    than the two older children.  This has caused problems  as  she  cannot
    pick the youngest child up because of her back pain. She describes  the
    appellant as continuing to play a key role in caring for  the  children
    and he is the one who is primarily responsible for dropping the  second
    child at nursery.

44.  The First-tier Tribunal accepted the evidence  of  both  the  appellant
    and his wife and the documentary evidence confirms that  the  appellant
    has been awarded the carer's allowance (A251) and that the couple  have
    the use of a motability car (A221).  When assessing the impact  of  the
    appellant's wife's condition, I must  take  into  account  the  medical
    evidence.  There is a report dated  10  December  2010  (A11)  from  Dr
    Evangelou, consultant neurologist, which confirmed that the appellant's
    wife was under the care of the multiple sclerosis  team  in  Nottingham
    and had been since 2004 when she was diagnosed with relapsing/remitting
    multiple sclerosis.  He explained that:

         "Some patients can have a relatively mild disease but others can be
         severely disabled.  Judging from the course of the disease  in  the
         first few years you can get an idea of the severity of the  disease
         in the long term.  [The appellant's wife] was diagnosed in 2004 and
         when she was last seen in 2010  she  had  accumulated  very  little
         disability... Judging from the progression of her illness over  the
         first six years it is  anticipated  that  the  next  10  years  her
         symptoms will become more prominent.  She will  still  be  able  to
         walk independently.  It is less likely that her  mobility  will  be
         more seriously affected. Other symptoms that patients with multiple
         sclerosis experience could be urinary, coordination and numbness".

    Dr Evangelou said that she  did  not  experience  significant  problems
    requiring intensive care but that patients with multiple sclerosis have
    good days and bad days.

45   In a letter dated 6 February 2014 (A203) from  the  appellant's  wife's
    medical centre in response to a request to confirm that  she  had  been
    diagnosed as suffering from multiple sclerosis, it  is  confirmed  that
    the diagnosis dates back to about 2004, that she is under the  care  of
    neurology specialists at the Queens Medical Centre  in  Nottingham  and
    periodically requires treatment with betaferon.    More recently, there
    is a letter from the Nottingham NHS trust dated 22 November 2016  (A18)
    to confirm that she will shortly  be  started  on  tecfidera,  an  oral
    medication licensed for the treatment of  relapsing/remitting  multiple
    sclerosis and a letter dated 28 November 2016  (A14)  from  a  multiple
    sclerosis nurse to the appellant's GP  confirming  that  the  appellant
    attended a day case unit on 28 November  2016  to  initiate  tests  for
    tecfidera,  a  disease  modifying  treatment  for   relapsing/remitting
    multiple sclerosis which could reduce relapse rates by 49%.

46.  In the light of the medical evidence and given the  relapsing/remitting
    nature of her condition there must inevitably be uncertainty about  her
    future condition and that relapses could recur at any  time.   However,
    the latest medical  evidence  is  to  the  effect  that  she  has  been
    receiving treatment which has the potential to reduce relapses by up to
    49%.  No further medical evidence has been produced about the impact of
    that treatment to date.   In the respondent's decision letter of 7  May
    2016 at para 72 it is said that in the 2012 Tribunal decision  at  [15]
    the appellant's wife stated that though her condition she needed a  lot
    of support from the appellant and that while she has  a  good  network,
    she felt bad about having to ask for help regularly as she did when the
    appellant was in prison.  The letter  argues,  and  this  argument  was
    adopted by Mr Tufan, that as a British citizen the appellant's wife did
    not have to rely on family and friends for help that  she  may  require
    and  could  seek  any  help  from   local   authorities   and   medical
    professionals to provide any support she required.

47.  The availability of such help is a relevant factor  to  be  taken  into
    account although it will probably need to be supplemented by help  from
    family and friends.  In the past her family have provided  support  but
    it is submitted that they are now only able  to  do  so  to  a  limited
    degree.  However, the fact remains  that  help  is  available  and  the
    appellant's wife had to look for such support when the appellant was in
    prison.  I do not accept that the appellant's wife will be without help
    from family and friends and she is also likely to receive help from the
    multiple sclerosis team and from social services.

48   I must also take into account the best interests of the children  as  a
    primary consideration.  I accept that the  appellant  has  a  good  and
    close relationship with his eldest child as  set  out  in  the  witness
    statements and in the social work assessment  dated  30  November  2016
    prepared by an independent social worker, Mr C.  Musendo.   It  is  his
    view, which I accept and  agree  with,  that  the  deportation  of  the
    appellant  will  not  be  in  the  best  interests  of  the   children,
    particularly the older child,  and that removing him  from  the  family
    unit is likely to have a negative impact on his wife's ability to  meet
    their children's needs. I note that when  Mr  Musendo  dealt  with  the
    capability of each parent to meet the children's needs  [43-45  of  his
    report], he says that it is evident from the medical records  that  his
    wife has periods of disability and periods of remission [44]  and  that
    it is therefore inevitable that if the appellant is  removed  from  his
    family unit, it could have an impact on the quality of  care  given  by
    his wife to their children and at [52] that if the appellant is removed
    from the family unit, this is likely to compromise the quality of  care
    given to the children.  However,  as  I  have  already  indicated,  the
    extent of the impact on the quality of care given  by  the  appellant's
    wife can be mitigated by the help available to her.

49.  I must now weigh up these  various  factors  to  consider  whether  the
    appellant can show that there are very  compelling  circumstances  over
    and above those described in para 399 (a) and (b) and Exceptions 1  and
    2 of the 2002 Act.  I remind myself that the appellant is  entitled  to
    rely on these factors establishing undue harshness as seeking  to  show
    that there are such very compelling  circumstances.   I  must  consider
    whether those factors whether taken by  themselves  or  in  conjunction
    with other relevant factors satisfy the requirements  of  para  398  or
    s.117C(6) of the 2002 Act.

50.  The best interests of the children area primary consideration but  they
    can be outweighed by other factors.  I must take into account the  fact
    that the appellant has committed three further offences since the index
    offence.  Whilst the Tribunal decision in 2012 has been treated as  the
    starting point for the assessment of the current  situation,  the  fact
    remains that that Tribunal reached a decision on the basis of  the  law
    before the Rules were amended  and  the  provisions  of  part  5A  were
    introduced into the 2002 Act.

51.  Although there is no issue  that  the  appellant's  wife  suffers  from
    multiple sclerosis, and whilst the evidence  supports  the  finding  of
    undue harshness, it does not support a  finding  that  there  are  very
    compelling circumstances over and above the  factors  leading  to  that
    finding.  The  appellant's  wife  is  receiving  treatment  capable  of
    reducing relapse rates and does have help available  to  her  not  only
    from family and friends also from medical and social services.

52.  Taking all these factors into account and sympathetic as I  am  to  the
    situation in which the appellant's wife and children find themselves, I
    am not satisfied  that  there  are  other  factors  amounting  to  very
    compelling circumstances over and above those leading to the finding of
    undue harshness to outweigh the public  interest  in  deportation  and,
    accordingly, the appellant fails to show that he can meet the high test
    set out in para 398 and  s  117C(6).  The  appeal  must  fail  on  both
    immigration and human rights grounds.

Decision

53.  The First-tier Tribunal erred in law and  the  decision  has  been  set
    aside.  I re-make the decision by dismissing  the  appeal  against  the
    deportation order.

54.  The anonymity order made by the First-tier Tribunal  remains  in  force
    until further order.
