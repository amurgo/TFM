                          DETERMINATION BY CONSENT


    Pursuant to Rule 39 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 and by the consent of the parties the following order is made:

    Upon the parties agreement that the  determination  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal promulgated on 31st March 2016 discloses a material  error  of
    law, it is hereby order by consent that:

      1. The judge made material errors of law in  relation  to  failing  to
         make findings upon the Appellant's reasons for claiming asylum, and
         the Appellants were denied a fair hearing.

      2. The determination is set aside in its  entirety  with  no  findings
         preserved, and

      3. The matter is remitted to be heard by a  judge  of  the  First-tier
         Tribunal other than Judge Majid.




    The Secretary of State's appeal in  the  Upper  Tribunal  is  therefore
    allowed.  The decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  is  set  aside  for
    legal error.




Signed                                  Date 8th June 2016


Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Saini
