                              APPROVED JUDGMENT

   Covid-19: This judgment was handed down remotely by circulation to the
 parties' representatives by email, release to BAILII and publication on the
 Courts and Tribunals Judiciary website. The date and time for hand-down is
                 deemed to be 4pm on Friday, 6 November 2020


Judge Blundell:

 1. The first applicant is a Pakistani national who was born on 1  February
    1977.  The second and third applicants are his wife and  child.   Their
    status has at all times been dependent  upon  his  and  they  raise  no
    separate complaints in this application for judicial  review.   In  the
    circumstances, I propose to  refer  to  the  first  applicant  as  'the
    applicant'.


 2. The applicant applies for judicial review of decisions which were  made
    by the respondent on 10 July and 27 August 2019.  By the first, he  was
    refused leave to remain as a Tier 1  (Entrepreneur)  Migrant.   By  the
    second, the  respondent  refused  his  application  for  Administrative
    Review.   Before  I  explain  the  basis  of  the  application  or  the
    decisions, it is necessary to set out some of the earlier parts of  the
    chronology.

Background

 3. The applicant was granted entry clearance as a Tier 4 (General) Student
    Migrant in 2010.  He entered the country in that capacity  and  studied
    in London, obtaining a Masters  in  Business  Administration.   He  was
    subsequently granted leave to  remain  as  a  Tier  1  (Highly  Skilled
    Worker) Migrant and then, in 2014, as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur)  Migrant.
    On  12  March  2014,  a  company  called  B  J  Business  Services  was
    incorporated under the Companies Act.  The applicant  was  and  is  the
    sole director of the company.

 4. On 19 May 2017, the applicant applied for further leave  as  a  Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur) Migrant.  Amongst other documents submitted  in  support
    of that application there was a letter from a firm  of  accountants  in
    Tooting, which stated that they acted as accountants for B  J  Business
    Services and that the applicant  remained  the  only  director  of  the
    company.  The accountants confirmed that the applicant had  invested  a
    little more than  �50,000  in  the  company  by  way  of  an  unsecured
    director's loan.  Management accounts dated 8 May 2017  were  produced,
    showing the loan in question.  As  I  have  said,  a  number  of  other
    documents were also provided with the  application,  included  but  not
    limited to the unsecured loan agreement and company  accounts  for  the
    preceding years.

 5. At all material times, the registered address for B J Business Services
    was 20-22 Wenlock Road in Hoxton, London N1 and the company's principal
    activities were said to be business consultancy  and  telecommunication
    services.  The company traded from 179 Chatham  High  Street  in  Kent,
    however.  As printed on 5 August  2017,  the  company's  entry  on  the
    Gumtree  website  stated  that  it  offered  the   following   services
    (reproduced verbatim):

         we offer support to individuals, small to medium businesses in  the
         form of strategic marketing and management consultancy.our business
         consultancy services geared to  take  your  business  to  the  next
         level, often tackle difficult markets  whilst  bringing  return  on
         investment (ROI) at an early stage.we can hep define and  implement
         your  marketing  strategy  and   client   relationship   management
         strategies that meet your business aspirations.we work on different
         key market sectors  including  retail,publishing  ,  online  media,
         telecoms and many more.our business development  firm  operates  as
         vertically  integrated  branding,  marketing,  sales   growth   and
         management  consultancy  provider.our  primary   services   include
         channel marketing,media planning,buying,creative  services,  search
         marketing and search engine optimization,management consultancy and
         sale growth strategy planning.

 6. There then followed a list of sixteen 'busines gear up services'  which
    were offered 'at  competitive  prices'.   The  advertisement  gave  the
    applicant's name and the Wenlock Road address. The map on the  website,
    however, suggested that the company was in Yangon, Myanmar.


 7. The respondent  decided  that  a  visit  to  the  applicant's  business
    premises was appropriate.  At 11am on 10 May  2018,  officers  attended
    the premises in Chatham, declaring to the applicant that the purpose of
    the visit was to enable  him  to  provide  further  information  or  to
    clarify information which he had already provided  in  support  of  his
    pending Tier 1 application.   The  officers  remained  for  two  hours,
    during which they inspected the premises (which the applicant described
    as  a  retail  shop  selling  bags,  wholesale  mobile  phones,   phone
    accessories and SIM cards), in addition to interviewing  the  applicant
    at some length in a small office at the rear of the shop which had been
    'newly created from plasterboard with a door'.  I will return  to  what
    was said in that interview in due  course.   It  suffices  for  present
    purposes to note that the application was refused on  8  February  2019
    because the respondent was not  satisfied  that  the  applicant  was  a
    genuine entrepreneur.  Requests for Administrative Review were  refused
    later that year.


 8. On 20 May 2019, the applicant made a further application for  leave  to
    remain as a Tier 1 Entrepreneur.  He relied again on  his  position  as
    the sole director of B J Business Services.   Oddly,  no  copy  of  the
    application is before me but it is clear from the first decision  under
    challenge that the applicant presented  evidence  in  support  of  this
    application which he had not presented with the 2017 application.  Four
    items of additional evidence are  listed  at  pp2-3  of  the  decision:
    reports, accounts and financial statements for  the  company;  business
    bank statements; employee documents  and  'other  business  documents'.
    There was no  further  interview  before  the  respondent  refused  the
    application.

The Decisions Under Challenge

 9. In the decision of July  2019,  the  respondent  gave  three  pages  of
    reasons for refusing the application.  I do not propose to set out  the
    reasons in full.  They may be summarised as follows:


      i) The applicant had stated in interview  that  he  spent  �50-60  per
         month on advertising, whereas the accounts for the period ending  8
         May 2017 showed total expenditure of �1000 on advertising  and  PR.
         The discrepancy led the respondent to question the  credibility  of
         the financial accounts of the business.


     ii) The applicant had stated in  interview  that  he  had  stopped  the
         business development side of his business to focus on mobile  phone
         sales but he had also stated that he intended to turn the  premises
         into a coffee shop or a restaurant.  This  led  the  respondent  to
         conclude that the business plans  and  activities  appeared  to  be
         'unfocussed'.


    iii) The applicant's website  showed  that  he  still  offered  business
         development services, whereas he had stated in interview that he no
         longer did so.  The respondent expected a functioning  business  to
         have a website showing the services currently offered.


     iv) The website had also shown, for four years, a company  location  in
         Myanmar.  Whilst that had now been corrected,  a  genuine  business
         would not have had such misleading information on its  website  for
         such a time.


      v) The applicant stated at interview that he had not carried  out  any
         market research and this was of concern, both in  relation  to  the
         mobile phone business and  the  potential  future  franchise  of  a
         coffee shop.  The respondent noted that  the  applicant  had  prior
         experience in the mobile phone sector but did not  accept  that  he
         would invest �50,000 without carrying out market research.


     vi) There was no signage at the shop on Chatham High Street, in  breach
         of Companies House rules, and  the  respondent  did  not  expect  a
         genuine business to operate without a sign.


    vii) The applicant had been unable to provide any evidence  of  business
         activity within the 28 days preceding the  visit.   Whilst  further
         evidence had been submitted with the more recent  application,  the
         respondent had concluded on balance  that  the  applicant  had  not
         satisfied the 'genuineness test' in the Immigration Rules.


   viii) The applicant had been unable  during  the  visit  to  produce  any
         evidence of work done by employees  and  had  not  known  that  any
         employees were entitled to paid annual leave.

10. As a result of these concerns, the respondent refused  the  application
    under paragraph 245DD(k) of the Immigration Rules, concluding that  the
    applicant had not 'met the genuineness test' under that  paragraph,  as
    expanded by paragraph 245DD(l).  These concerns also  led  to  refusals
    under sub-paragraphs 245DD(b) and (n).  (I set out the relevant version
    of the rule below).


11. The application for Administrative Review was made on 30 July 2019  and
    refused, as I have already stated, on 27 August  2019.   The  reviewing
    officer concluded that there were no caseworking errors, as defined  in
    the Immigration Rules, and the original  decision  was  maintained.   A
    Letter Before Action  which  was  provided  to  the  respondent  on  15
    November 2019 did not persuade her to take a different view.

Application for Judicial Review

12. This claim was issued on 26 November 2019.  The  grounds  for  judicial
    review were settled by Mr Sarker.  The  central  submission,  which  Mr
    Sarker accepts must prosper if this application is to succeed, is  that
    the interview which took place in May 2018 was procedurally unfair  due
    to an overly rigid adherence to  a  pre-prepared  line  of  questioning
    which resulted in a failure to 'probe' answers given by the  applicant,
    as in R (Anjum) v ECO [2017] UKUT 406 (IAC) and contrary to R (Mushtaq)
    v ECO [2015] UKUT 224 (IAC).


13. Permission was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Kamara,  who  considered
    that point in particular to be arguable.

The Immigration Rules

14. It was agreed by the parties that the version of paragraph 245DD of the
    Immigration Rules which was initially cited by Mr Sarker  was  not  the
    version in force at the time of  the  decision  under  challenge.   The
    correct version, as appended to the Detailed Grounds of  Defence  which
    were settled by Mr Lenanton, is materially as follows:


    245DD. Requirements for leave to remain


    To qualify for leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant under
    this rule, an applicant must meet the requirements listed below. If the
    applicant meets these requirements, leave to remain will be granted. If
    the applicant does not meet these requirements, the application will be
    refused.


    Requirements:


      a) ...


      b) The applicant must have a minimum of 75 points under paragraphs  35
         to 53 of Appendix A.

      c) -    (h) [...]

      i) The applicant  must  provide  a  business  plan,  setting  out  his
         proposed business activities in the UK and how he expects  to  make
         his business succeed.

      j) ...

      k) Where the applicant has, or was last granted, leave  as  a  Tier  1
         (Entrepreneur) Migrant and is  being  assessed  under  Table  5  of
         Appendix A, the Secretary of State must be satisfied that:
          i) the applicant has established, taken over or become a director
             of one or more genuine businesses in the UK, and has genuinely
             operated that business or businesses while he had leave  as  a
             Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant; and
         ii) the applicant has genuinely invested the money referred to  in
             Table 5 of Appendix A into one or more genuine  businesses  in
             the UK to be  spent  for  the  purpose  of  that  business  or
             businesses; and
        iii) the applicant genuinely intends to continue operating  one  or
             more businesses in the UK; and
         iv) the applicant does not intend to take employment in the United
             Kingdom other than under the terms of paragraph 245DE.


      l) In making the assessment in (k), the Secretary of State will assess
         the balance of probabilities. The Secretary of State may take  into
         account the following factors:
          i) the evidence the applicant has submitted;
         ii) the viability and credibility  of  the  source  of  the  money
             referred to in Table 5 of Appendix A;
        iii) the credibility of the financial accounts of the  business  or
             businesses;
         iv) the credibility of the applicant's business  activity  in  the
             UK, including when he had leave as  a  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)
             Migrant;
          v) the credibility of the job creation for which the applicant is
             claiming points in Table 5 of Appendix A;
         vi)  if  the   nature   of   the   business   requires   mandatory
             accreditation, registration  and/or  insurance,  whether  that
             accreditation,  registration   and/or   insurance   has   been
             obtained; and
        vii) any other relevant information.


      m) ...


      n) If the Secretary of State is not satisfied with the genuineness  of
         the application in relation  to  a  points-scoring  requirement  in
         Appendix A, those points will not be awarded.

      o) The Secretary of State may decide not to carry out  the  assessment
         in (k) if the  application  already  falls  for  refusal  on  other
         grounds, but reserves the right to carry out this assessment in any
         reconsideration of the decision.

      p) -    (t)      [...]

Submissions

15. Mr Sarker prefaced his submissions  with  the  following  observations.
    Firstly, the applicant was an established businessman who  had  already
    enjoyed a period of leave  as  an  entrepreneur.   Secondly,  the  core
    authority on which he would rely was Anjum and the  interview  in  this
    case was characterised by a lack of follow-up questioning  or  probing,
    as in Anjum.  Thirdly, the procedural difficulties with  the  interview
    were such that the decision was vitiated by public law error,  even  if
    it could not be shown  that  all  of  the  respondent's  concerns  were
    erroneous.


16. Developing the points made in his grounds and his skeleton argument, Mr
    Sarker submitted that three of the respondent's  central  concerns  had
    not been fairly investigated during the interview.  The  first  related
    to the applicant's expenditure on advertising.  He had only been  asked
    about advertising expenditure in the interview,  whereas  the  relevant
    accounts related to advertising and PR.  Public Relations was clearly a
    different  category  of  expenditure.   All  that  the  respondent  had
    discovered in interview was that the applicant spent �50-�60 per  month
    on advertising.  There was no discrepancy  between  that  sum  and  the
    suggestion in the accounts  that  he  had  spent  �1000  per  annum  on
    advertising and PR, since the latter sum clearly took Public  Relations
    expenditure  into  account.   There  had  been   a   clear   error   of
    comprehension on the respondent's part, brought  about  by  a  lack  of
    proper questioning in the interview.  I asked Mr  Sarker  what  the  PR
    expenditure had been in the year in  question,  and  how  it  had  been
    spent.  He had no instructions on that issue, and was not able to  take
    me to any relevant documents.

17. Mr Sarker's second  submission  was  that  the  respondent  had  failed
    properly to investigate the applicant's suggestion that he would open a
    restaurant on the site of the existing  business.   The  applicant  had
    given this answer but there had been no follow-up  questions  asked  by
    the interviewing officer whatsoever.  The respondent had concluded that
    the applicant's business intentions were 'unfocussed' but the interview
    provided no proper basis  for  that  conclusion.   I  asked  Mr  Sarker
    whether there was  a  business  plan  which  detailed  the  applicant's
    intentions in this regard.  He said that there was not, and he did  not
    understand  any  business  plan  to  have  been  submitted   with   the
    application.  He  submitted  that  it  was  not  a  requirement  in  an
    application for further leave to remain.  Whether or not there had been
    a business plan, the respondent had failed in her public  law  duty  to
    conduct the interview in a procedurally fair manner.

18. Mr Sarker  submitted,  thirdly,  that  the  respondent  had  failed  to
    consider why the applicant had said that he did not conduct any  market
    research.  He had said that he had experience of the SIM card market at
    a company called Simmax and it was clear that he had been granted leave
    to remain in order to pursue this business venture.   These  were  both
    relevant matters for the respondent to consider before criticising  the
    applicant's lack of market research into his business.  Had  she  asked
    further questions of the applicant, particularly as regards his role at
    Simmax, she would not have been concerned about the absence  of  market
    research.  Equally, the respondent had failed  to  investigate  in  any
    meaningful way the applicant's idea of converting the premises  into  a
    caf� or restaurant.  The applicant  had  explained  why  he  wished  to
    change his business (there having been a drop  in  income  from  mobile
    phone sales) and this was a feasible explanation.

19. As to the remaining points taken against the applicant  (regarding  the
    signage, the website and  the  compliance  with  employment  law),  the
    applicant could still have a genuine business even if those points were
    validly made.  On reflection, Mr Sarker was constrained to accept  that
    these points were open to the  respondent  in  public  law  terms.   He
    submitted, however, that there were serious flaws in other respects and
    that these points would not suffice, in and of themselves,  to  sustain
    the decision.

20. At my request, Mr Sarker helpfully took  brief  instructions  from  the
    applicant and confirmed that the  busines  had  been  one  of  business
    consultancy in 2014 but the applicant had switched to SIM  sales  (etc)
    in 2017.

21. Mr Lenanton developed his detailed grounds of defence and his  skeleton
    argument as follows.  He began by noting that the applicant had brought
    his challenge to the first decision beyond the three  month  'backstop'
    for judicial review but he confirmed that the respondent took no  point
    on that.  He noted, as I had during Mr Sarker's submissions,  that  the
    applicant  had  apparently  failed  to  comply   with   the   mandatory
    requirement to provide a business plan with his application.  No  point
    had been taken on that in the refusal letter, however, and Mr  Lenanton
    had no instructions to raise the point in defence of the decision.   He
    also noted that the applicant appeared to have been involved  in  sales
    before 2017 but that the application for leave to remain in 2014 seemed
    to have been based on business consultancy alone.

22. As to the merits of the claim, Mr Lenanton submitted that the scope  of
    the duty of procedural fairness was context-specific, citing  EK  (Cote
    D'Ivoire) [2014] EWCA Civ 1517; [2015] Imm AR  367.   The  decision  in
    Anjum was properly to be regarded as one which turned on its own facts.
     Those facts included a mistake of fact being made by the respondent; a
    failure to examine the applicant's business  plan;  and  a  failure  to
    clarify inconsistent answers.  None of those  concerns  arose  in  this
    case.  This was the applicant's third application for leave  to  remain
    as a Tier 1 Entrepreneur.  He knew what he was  expected  to  establish
    and what he was expected to submit.  The purpose of the  interview  was
    to assess the underlying application, as had been stated at the outset.



23. It was clear that the respondent's enquiry, and the reasons  given  for
    refusing  the  application,  had  followed  the  approach  required  by
    paragraph 245DD(l)  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   There  had  been  no
    advertising expenditure in the first sets of company  accounts  but  it
    had been suggested in later accounts  that  �1000  had  been  spent  on
    advertising and PR.  It was to be noted that Mr Sarker  was  unable  to
    state on instructions whether any money had in fact been spent on PR in
    the period in question.  Significantly, however, if the  applicant  had
    indeed spent  �50-�60  per  month  on  advertising  during  the  period
    considered in the decision, he would have spent significantly more than
    �1000.  In all the circumstances, it had not been  irrational  for  the
    respondent to attach significance to the discrepancy between  what  was
    said in the accounts and what was said at interview.

24. It was accepted, in response to Mr Sarker's second submission, that the
    applicant had not been  'probed'  about  his  intention  to  set  up  a
    restaurant but it was to be recalled that the onus was on the applicant
    to  establish  that  he  was  a  genuine  entrepreneur.    There   were
    opportunities  in  the  interview  for   him   to   volunteer   further
    information.  The evidence he  had  given  at  interview  was  properly
    categorised as 'unfocused' and  there  was  no  evidence  that  he  had
    applied for an A3 licence in order to convert the premises into a  caf�
    or restaurant.  The applicant was a man who had purportedly jumped from
    one business to another and the respondent was  perfectly  entitled  to
    consider  that  he  was  not  able  to  satisfy  the   requirement   of
    'genuineness'.

25. As for the applicant's experience of the SIM card market,  it  was  not
    correct to submit that this had been overlooked by the respondent.   It
    had, in fact, been taken expressly into account.   As  he  had  in  the
    skeleton, Mr Lenanton submitted that this was mere disagreement on  the
    part of the applicant; the respondent had  been  entitled  to  conclude
    that the absence of market research militated against the applicant.

26. There was, in truth, no public law error in the remaining points, as Mr
    Sarker had ultimately accepted.  The decision was to  be  viewed  as  a
    whole and even if there had been a flaw in it, it  should  nevertheless
    be upheld when considered holistically.

27. In response, Mr Sarker submitted that Mr Lenanton had misunderstood the
    respondent's calculations in the  decision  letter.   Her  concern  was
    clearly that the amount spent on advertising was less than  the  amount
    stated in the accounts, and it was not possible to read the decision in
    the way suggested by Mr Lenanton.  The reality of this  case  was  that
    matters of concern had not been put to the  applicant.   The  questions
    were scripted and did not follow on from the  answers.   The  interview
    failed, just as it had in Anjum, to react to the evolving circumstances
    which the applicant had described to the interviewing officers.  In the
    event that such a procedural failing was found, the decision could  not
    stand as a whole.

Relevant Authorities

28.  As I will come to explain, counsel were essentially in agreement as to
    the governing principles of procedural fairness and the  scope  of  the
    disagreement about their application in the present context was  rather
    smaller than it first appeared to be.


29. Both counsel referred, quite rightly, to what was said by Lord  Mustill
    in R v SSHD ex parte Doody & Ors [1994] 1 AC 531.  As  is  well  known,
    those cases concerned the Secretary of State's decisions regarding  the
    penal elements of mandatory life sentences  following  convictions  for
    murder.  The Court of Appeal had held that the Secretary of  State  was
    required to give those convicted an opportunity to make representations
    before fixing the term.  The Secretary of State appealed.  Lord Mustill
    was the only member of the  Appellate  Committee  to  give  a  reasoned
    opinion, with which  the  remaining  members  agreed.   At  p560,  Lord
    Mustill set out six observations requiring the scope of the duty to act
    fairly.  The following are relevant to the applicant's case:


         (2) The standards of fairness are not immutable.  They  may  change
         with the passage  of  time,  both  in  the  general  and  in  their
         application to decisions of a particular type.


         (3) The principles of fairness  are  not  to  be  applied  by  rote
         identically in every situation. What fairness demands is  dependent
         on the context of the decision,  and  this  is  to  be  taken  into
         account in all its aspects. (...)


         (5) Fairness will very often require  that  a  person  who  may  be
         adversely affected by the decision will have an opportunity to make
         representations on his own behalf either  before  the  decision  is
         taken with a view to producing a favourable result; or after it  is
         taken, with a view to procuring its modification; or both.


         (6) Since  the  person  affected  usually  cannot  make  worthwhile
         representations without knowing what factors may weigh against  his
         interests fairness will very often require that he is  informed  of
         the gist of the case which he has to answer.

30. EK (Ivory Coast), to which Mr Lenanton  particularly  referred,  was  a
    Tier 4  case  in  which  the  applicant's  college  had  withdrawn  its
    sponsorship of the applicant's application for further leave to remain.
     The respondent had decided the  application  on  the  basis  that  the
    sponsorship  had  been  withdrawn,  without  giving  the  applicant  an
    opportunity to make representations or  to  find  a  new  sponsor.   It
    seemed that there had been an error on the part of the college, and  it
    was contended that the respondent should have postponed the decision on
    the application in order  to  give  the  applicant  an  opportunity  to
    correct any such error.  The applicant had been unsuccessful before the
    FtT and the Upper Tribunal,  both  of  which  had  concluded  that  the
    applicant had not  had  a  CAS  at  the  relevant  time  and  that  the
    respondent had been correct, in  those  circumstances,  to  refuse  the
    application.


31. Sales and Briggs LJJ (as they then were) noted that it was accepted  by
    the Secretary of State that the Immigration Rules did not  exclude  the
    general public law duty to act fairly.  They concluded,  however,  that
    there had been no breach of the duty to act fairly, since the Secretary
    of State was not responsible  for  the  general  unfairness  which  the
    appellant had suffered.  In so holding, Sales LJ noted that the  Points
    Based System provided a simplified procedure for applying for leave  to
    remain and that it assisted applicants to know what evidence  they  had
    to submit in support of their applications: [28] and  [33].   Sales  LJ
    contrasted this context with that which was  considered  in  Doody,  in
    which 'what was at stake was the  liberty  of  the  subject'.   In  the
    context  under  consideration,  what  was  in  issue  was  'whether  an
    applicant for leave to enter or remain can persuade  the  Secretary  of
    State to grant them something in relation to which they have  no  prior
    right or expectation, in  accordance  with  a  simple  and  mechanistic
    points system.': [37].  EK's was not a case, Sales LJ  observed,  which
    was comparable with cases such as Patel [2011] UKUT 211 (IAC), in which
    the respondent had herself brought about a change of  circumstances  by
    withdrawing the sponsoring college's licence: [38].  Insofar as a wider
    principle of fairness had been  enunciated  in  Naved  [2012]  UKUT  14
    (IAC), it was disapproved for failing to consider the 'highly modulated
    and fact-sensitive way in which the general public law duty of fairness
    operates.': [39].  Floyd LJ dissented, holding that the respondent  had
    become aware of a material change of circumstances between the date  of
    the application and the date of her decision and should  have  afforded
    the applicant an opportunity to correct it.


32. Mr Sarker gave particular  prominence  to  R  (Anjum)  v  SSHD  in  his
    submissions.  That was a decision of the Upper  Tribunal  (McCloskey  J
    and UTJ Dawson) in which  the  respondent's  assessment  of  a  Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur) Migrant application was held to have  been  procedurally
    unfair.  The Entry Clearance Officer had concluded that  the  applicant
    did not have access to a  minimum  of  �200,000,  as  required  by  the
    Immigration Rules.  That conclusion was based on the answers  given  by
    the applicant at interview, which the respondent  considered  were  not
    credible in the respects listed by McCloskey J  at  [6].   The  reasons
    were amended following an application for Administrative Review but the
    refusal was maintained.

33. The Upper Tribunal considered there to be a  number  of  flaws  in  the
    conduct of the interview.  Amongst other things, it was noted that  the
    applicant was not  given  an  opportunity  to  clarify  two  manifestly
    incoherent responses and the atmosphere of the interview was unfriendly
    and uncomfortable: [16].  The fact that the applicant was not asked any
    questions about his business plan was described by the  Upper  Tribunal
    as 'striking', at [17].  There had been no probing  or  exploration  of
    projections in the business plan and their  relevance  to  the  answers
    given by the applicant in the interview: [19].  It  was  clear  to  the
    Upper  Tribunal  that  neither  the  ECO  nor  the  ECM  had  correctly
    understood  the  business  proposal:  [19].   Having   considered   the
    authorities,  including  Doody,  the  Upper  Tribunal  held  that   the
    applicant's challenge to the decision on grounds of procedural fairness
    was made out because the respondent had failed  to  probe  and  clarify
    answers  given  by  the  applicant  at  interview  when  those  answers
    'demanded' such clarification.  (I shall not refer to the second ground
    of challenge, since it is not relevant to  the  case  before  me.)  The
    judicial headnote to the decision is materially as follows:


         An immigration interview  may  be  unfair,  thereby  rendering  the
         resulting decision unlawful, where inflexible structural  adherence
         to prepared questions excludes the spontaneity necessary to  repeat
         or clarify obscure questions and/or to probe or  elucidate  answers
         given.

34. There was also reference in the documents before me to  R  (Mushtaq)  v
    ECO (Islamabad) [2015] UKUT 224 (IAC).  In  the  event,  there  was  no
    reference to it at the hearing  and  I  set  out  only  the  first  two
    paragraphs of the judicial headnote:


      i) The common law principles  of  procedural  fairness  apply  to  the
         decision making processes of Entry Clearance Officers ("ECOs").

     ii)  ECO  interviews  serve  the  basic  twofold  purpose  of  enabling
         applications to be probed  and  investigated  and,  simultaneously,
         giving the applicant a fair opportunity to respond  to  potentially
         adverse  matters.  The  ensuing  decision  must  accord  with   the
         principles of procedural fairness.

35. The Secretary of State relied on the unreported decision in R  (Taj)  v
    SSHD (JR/04568/2018) at an earlier stage in these  proceedings  but  Mr
    Lenanton confirmed at [7] that he no longer sought to rely upon it.

Analysis

36. Mr Lenanton submitted that Anjum was a case on  its  own  facts,  which
    included a mistake of fact on the part of the  decision  maker  and  an
    atmosphere of discomfort in the interview.  He submitted that it  'also
    concerned'  the  failure  of   the   interviewing   officer   to   seek
    clarification, amplification or comment from the applicant on  material
    matters.


37. It is not correct, in my judgment, to seek to confine Anjum to its  own
    facts.  Whilst there were additional sources of concern  in  that  case
    (the misunderstanding of the business plan being one such concern), the
    over-riding concern expressed by the Upper Tribunal was the  procedural
    fairness of the  interview  and,  in  particular,  the  fact  that  the
    applicant had not been asked to clarify inconsistent  answers  and  had
    not been 'probed' about various matters which had ultimately been  held
    against him.  It was the Upper Tribunal's concern about  those  aspects
    of the case which prompted the judicial decision to report the judgment
    and to issue a headnote in the terms I have recorded above.

38. Anjum was a decision, like Mushtaq, in which the Upper Tribunal  sought
    to apply long-established principles in an immigration context and  the
    resulting decision might, with respect,  be  thought  not  to  progress
    matters very far beyond what was  actually  said  by  Lord  Mustill  in
    Doody.  It was expressly accepted by the  respondent  in  Alam  v  SSHD
    [2012] EWCA Civ 960; [2012] Imm AR 974 that the Immigration  Rules  did
    not exclude the general public law duty to act fairly. That  concession
    was repeated before the Court  of  Appeal  in  EK  (Ivory  Coast).   In
    Mushtaq, counsel for the respondent accepted that the fifth  and  sixth
    of Lord Mustill's holdings in  Doody  (as  above)  were  of  particular
    relevance.

39. Mr Lenanton sought to submit that the scope of the duty to  act  fairly
    in the context presently under consideration was to  be  considered  in
    light of EK (Ivory Coast).  I accept that submission  to  this  extent.
    As was noted by Sales LJ in his judgment  in  that  case,  the  PBS  is
    administered  by  a  highly  prescriptive  set  of  Immigration  Rules,
    detailing what an applicant must demonstrate in substance  and  how  it
    must be demonstrated  by  evidence.   That  level  of  prescription  is
    necessarily relevant when considering the extent to which an  applicant
    under the PBS can complain that they have not been given proper  notice
    of points which are to be taken against them.  It could not properly be
    said by a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur)  applicant,  to  take  a  very  obvious
    example, that the respondent had failed to alert  him  (whether  in  an
    interview or otherwise) to the fact that he had not provided a business
    plan in support of his application as a T1  Entrepreneur.   That  is  a
    requirement of the Immigration Rules and  an  applicant  could  not  be
    heard to submit that he had not had prior notice  of  the  respondent's
    concern.  At the other end of the spectrum will be matters about  which
    the applicant could not have known. In the event  that  the  respondent
    made enquiries with a third party who cast doubt on some aspect of  the
    applicant's case, for example, an applicant might legitimately complain
    that there had been no notice of that concern and he had no opportunity
    to meet it.  As Lord Steyn said in R (Anufrijeva) v SSHD  [2004]  1  AC
    604, at [30]: '[i]n our system of law surprise is regarded as the enemy
    of justice'.


40. In fairness to Mr  Lenanton,  he  did  not  seek  to  submit  that  the
    respondent was not under a duty to act fairly during the interview.  He
    accepted my suggestion that a decision would be open to challenge if it
    contained grounds of refusal on one subject when a completely different
    subject had been explored in  interview.   Ultimately,  therefore,  the
    advocates agreed that the material question in this case  was  whether,
    taking the process as a whole, the applicant had an indication  of  the
    case  against  him  and  had  been  given  an   opportunity   to   make
    representations about it before a decision was taken.

41. In answering that question, I must make two observations about context.
     The first is merely repetition of a point made above.  A PBS applicant
    knows, from the outset, what he is required to demonstrate and  how  he
    is required to demonstrate it.  To that extent at least, he is aware of
    the case he has to meet and the subject areas that  the  respondent  is
    likely to focus upon in her decision-making process.  As  a  result  of
    paragraph 245DD(l), a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) applicant  will  be  aware,
    for instance, that there will be particular scrutiny of  his  financial
    accounts, his business activity in the UK and the  credibility  of  his
    'job creation' in this country.


42. The second point about context is in relation to this particular  case.
    This was the applicant's third application for leave  to  remain  as  a
    Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant.  His first application had been granted.
     His second application was refused in February 2019.  The  refusal  of
    the application did not mean, however, that he  was  unable  to  secure
    leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur), however, and he was able to
    make another application, addressing any concerns which the  respondent
    had expressed in her first decision.  It is to be recalled,  therefore,
    that the applicant does not  challenge  a  decision  which  immediately
    followed an interview; he challenges a decision which was reached after
    an interview, a refusal and the submission of further material directed
    to the first refusal.


43. Taking those contextual points into account, I have no doubt  that  the
    decisions presently under challenge were not marred by a breach of  the
    respondent's public law duty to act fairly.  I take Mr  Sarker's  three
    principal submissions in order.


44. The first relates to the company's expenditure on Advertising  and  PR.
    There was a fundamental disagreement between counsel about the  meaning
    of the  decision  in  this  respect.   For  the  applicant,  Mr  Sarker
    understood the respondent to mean that  the  amount  suggested  in  the
    interview (�50-�60 per month)  was  significantly  less  than  the  sum
    claimed  in  the  relevant  accounts  (�1000  per  annum).    For   the
    respondent, Mr Lenanton submitted that the concern  was  actually  that
    the sum of �50-�60 per month was  significantly  more  than  �1000  per
    annum when the relevant period was understood.  He submitted  that  the
    relevant period was considerably longer  than  a  year,  and  that  the
    applicant would have spent significantly more than �1000 on leaflets if
    he had been spending �50-�60 per month.

45. As I explained to Mr Lenanton at the hearing, I was rather surprised to
    hear this submission.  Like Mr Sarker, I had read  the  decision  under
    challenge to mean that the company expenditure on advertising was lower
    than the sum given  in  the  relevant  accounts.   Having  re-read  the
    decision letter, I am unable to accept the respondent's submission that
    the opposite meaning was intended.  I proceed on  the  basis  that  the
    meaning is as contended by Mr Sarker.

46. Mr Sarker's submission on this ground of refusal is quite  simple.   He
    takes me to questions 17 and 18 of the interview, which were asked  and
    answered as follows:

         (17) How much have you spent on advertising your business?


         Not much, go to the customers.  Leaflets - �50-�60 per month.   The
         marketing  /business  development  side  of  the  business  is  not
         advertised.


         (18) What forms of advertising have you used  and  where  have  you
         advertised?


         Leaflets - handed to customers - special deals for those  who  sell
         the SIM cards.

47. Based on these answers, Mr Sarker submits that the respondent made  two
    related errors.  The first was to misunderstand the expenses quoted  in
    the company accounts, which showed that the relevant expenditure was on
    Advertising and Public Relations combined.  The second was to  fail  to
    put the apparent discrepancy to the  applicant  before  it  formed  the
    first reason for refusing his  application.   Mr  Sarker  submits  that
    there is  a  fundamental  difference  between  advertising  and  public
    relations and that the applicant was entitled, given the way  that  the
    questions were framed, to focus solely on the company's expenditure  on
    the former.


48. The difficulty with this submission, as Mr Sarker seemed  to  recognise
    during the hearing, is that it has never been  said  by  the  applicant
    that there was another �400 or so  spent  on  public  relations.   This
    ground of refusal also featured in the February 2019 and the  applicant
    complained, when he made his  application  for  Administrative  Review,
    that the respondent had  failed  to  enquire  whether  there  were  any
    separate costs for PR.   At  no  stage  has  the  applicant  positively
    asserted that there were such separate costs and at  no  stage  has  he
    provided any documentary evidence of any such costs.   Indeed,  when  I
    asked Mr Sarker at the hearing whether he had instructions  that  there
    had been a separate 'spend' on Public Relations, he confirmed  that  he
    had no instructions on the point.  Ultimately,  therefore,  this  is  a
    complaint of procedural unfairness which is entirely  hollow,  in  that
    the applicant merely contends that he should have been 'probed' further
    about something but he is unable to state that anything material  would
    have emerged if he had been asked.


49. Even if the interview was procedurally  unfair  in  this  respect,  the
    applicant had an opportunity to address the respondent's  concern  when
    he made his subsequent application.  He could have submitted a  witness
    statement, supported with documents showing separate expenditure on  PR
    in the year in question.  He did not do  so,  and  the  respondent  was
    certainly entitled, when considering the course of events as  a  whole,
    to maintain the point which she had originally  made  in  the  February
    2019 decision, that the answer given was out of kilter with the company
    accounts submitted.


50. Mr Sarker's second main submission is that  the  respondent  failed  to
    'probe' the applicant further before concluding that his business plans
    or activities appeared to be 'unfocused'.  Again, it  is  necessary  to
    bear the entire course of events in mind.  The applicant secured  leave
    to remain to run the business described  on  the  website  (as  above).
    When he came to make an application for further leave to remain, he had
    moved away from business development and moved  into  the  business  of
    selling SIM cards, mobile phone accessories and bags from a high street
    shop.  It was questionable, in  other  words,  that  the  name  of  the
    business 'B J Business Services' even represented the  main  activities
    of the company.  When  the  respondent  came  to  visit  the  premises,
    however, the applicant said that he was thinking about moving on for  a
    second time.  He was recorded as saying this[1], in answer to  question
    7 of the interview:


         (7) What is the nature of your business?


         Retail shop - bags, wholesale mobile phones, phone accessories, sim
         cards (High St Shop).  Have  applied  for  A�  licence  to  open  a
         franchise of Starbucks, Costa or will  open  a  restaurant  (Indian
         cuisine or kebab) in the shop.   Marketing,  advertising,  business
         development - have stopped this part of the business last month  to
         concentrate on franchise.

51. I do not accept that it  was  necessary,  as  a  matter  of  procedural
    fairness, for there to be any further 'probing' of this  answer  during
    the interview.  The applicant was on  notice  -  as  a  result  of  the
    Immigration Rules - that the credibility of his business activity would
    be under scrutiny.  If he had moved away from the  business  model  for
    which he had been granted leave to  remain,  he  should  have  expected
    there to be greater scrutiny of his current business model and  of  any
    future intentions.  He was unable even to state whether he intended  to
    take a franchise for a coffee shop, to set up an Indian  restaurant  or
    to create a kebab house in the premises.  The respondent  was  entitled
    to conclude, without any further questioning, that this was a man whose
    intentions were unfocussed and therefore incredible.


52. As with the first point, however, Mr Sarker faces a further  difficulty
    when the whole course of the applicant's dealings with  the  respondent
    are  taken  into  account.   The  lack  of  focus  in  the  applicant's
    intentions was a  point  first  taken  in  the  February  2019  refusal
    decision.  He was not only on notice as a  result  of  the  Immigration
    Rules, therefore; he was on notice of the respondent's concern  because
    of the prior refusal.  He had  every  opportunity  to  submit  detailed
    information with his subsequent application, explaining how and why  he
    had made the move from business development to mobile phone  sales  and
    why he intended to move on again  into  the  food  industry.   No  such
    information was provided with the subsequent application, however,  and
    it was rational and procedurally proper for the respondent to  conclude
    that the situation remained as it had been when she reached her earlier
    decision.

53. At [36] of his skeleton argument, Mr  Sarker  takes  a  further  point,
    which he makes by comparison with the facts in Anjum.   In  that  case,
    the Upper Tribunal had noted the absence  of  any  exploration  of  the
    content of the business plan during the interview.  Mr  Sarker  submits
    that the circumstances in this case were similar, in that there was  no
    exploration  of  the  applicant's  future  plans  by  the  interviewing
    officer.  This submission only  serves  to  highlight  the  applicant's
    difficulty.   Unlike  in  Anjum,  there  was  no  business  plan  which
    highlighted the future expansion plans for  the  applicant's  business.
    It appears, in fact, that there was no business plan at all.  Mr Sarker
    was certainly unable to direct me to one, or  to  any  reference  to  a
    business plan in the papers.  The reference to an A3 licence and  to  a
    caf� or restaurant being opened in these high street premises cam about
    for the first time  in  the  interview.   This  was  absolutely  not  a
    detailed business idea with which the  respondent  failed  to  come  to
    grips; it was aptly described as an 'unfocused' intention, of which the
    respondent had been given no notice.


54. The applicant's third major submission is that the respondent failed to
    explore further with the applicant the reasons why he had not conducted
    any  market  research  into  his   businesses.    The   respondent   is
    alternatively criticised by Mr  Sarker  for  failing  to  take  account
    material matters, in the form of the applicant's experience in the  SIM
    sector and the relevant sections of the guidance in  relation  to  such
    experience.  I have thus far attempted not to set  out  tracts  of  the
    refusal letter, but it is necessary to set out this section in full:


         During your interview you also stated that you had not carried  out
         any market  research  in  relation  to  your  current  or  previous
         business activity.   This  causes  significant  concerns  as  would
         expect any business to carry out market research before investing a
         significant sum of funds into it.  Our concerns are further due  to
         your  previously  stated  claims  that  you  were  thinking   about
         investing into different areas such as the restaurant  industry  or
         coffee shop franchise sector.  We do not deem it credible that  you
         would claim to be planning to expand into a business  area  without
         carrying out any market research and as  such  this  casts  further
         doubt over the genuineness of your claimed business activity  as  a
         Tier 1 Entrepreneur Migrant.


         It  is  noted  that  when  submitting  your  application   for   an
         Administrative Review of your application you  referred  to  market
         research and claimed that because you have had prior experience  in
         this business and have succeeded, therefore  it  is  reasonable  to
         have not undertaken market research.  However, we do  not  find  it
         credible that genuine business would not carry out market  research
         before investing �50,000 into a business.

55. Mr Sarker complains that the respondent mandated  market  research  but
    there is obviously no merit in that complaint;  there  is  a  world  of
    difference  between  a  decision  maker  'expecting'  and   'requiring'
    something  to  be  demonstrated.   An  expectation  may  be   displaced
    depending on the circumstances, whereas a requirement is absolute.  The
    respondent only expressed an expectation in the paragraphs above.


56. Mr Sarker's principal submission on this point is that  the  respondent
    overlooked the applicant's prior experience in SIM sales.  He  had,  he
    said, been working as a Sales Adviser for a company called  SIMMAX  for
    two years, opening accounts for SIM cards (question  4  refers).   When
    the applicant was asked, at  question  14,  whether  he  had  conducted
    market research before investing in his company, he said  that  he  had
    experience of SIM sales and had  not  conducted  market  research.   Mr
    Sarker  draws  attention  to  the   respondent's   guidance   (Tier   1
    (Entrepreneur), version 24.0), which highlights the possible  relevance
    of 'previous experience in the field and in business'.


57. The applicant's submissions in  this  regard  fail  to  appreciate  the
    difference  between  the  applicant's  experience  at  Simmax  and  the
    business he had created on Chatham High Street.  The purpose of  market
    research is to understand whether the proposed  business  is  a  viable
    one, given the area of operation and other  such  considerations.   The
    uncontested fact that the applicant had worked at a company selling SIM
    cards did not mean that his own business selling SIM cards would  be  a
    viable one. His experience in the field did not obviate  the  need  for
    market research, contrary to Mr Sarker's submissions.   The  respondent
    was entitled, without exploring the point any further in interview,  to
    consider that it was  a  matter  of  concern  that  the  applicant  was
    seemingly  willing  to  invest  �50,000  in  a  business  when  he  had
    undertaken no research to understand the viability of  that  market  in
    that particular area.  The  validity  of  that  concern  is  proven  by
    reference to other parts of  the  interview.   It  is  clear  that  the
    appellant was operating in a specific geographical area,  for  example,
    and that his business had taken a significant downturn in recent  times
    (recording,  he  said  at  interview,  no  business  activity  for  the
    preceding 28 days).  Had  the  applicant  undertaken  market  research,
    rather than launching  as  he  did,  he  might  have  appreciated  that
    national or local competition was likely to be a problem and  that  the
    busines was not a viable one.


58. Mr Sarker also submits that the respondent focused on the  question  of
    market research without taking any, or any proper, account of the  fact
    that the applicant had  been  running  the  business  on  Chatham  High
    Street, as was demonstrated by the additional material  submitted  with
    the application.  That material does not detract from the  validity  of
    the respondent's concern, however.  In seeking to  decide  whether  the
    applicant was a credible entrepreneur, she was entitled to consider the
    efforts he had made to research the viability of the business.  She did
    not lose sight  of  the  applicant's  submission  that  he  had  'prior
    experience in this business and have succeeded'.  Having set  that  out
    in the decision, she concluded that it  did  not  obviate  her  concern
    about the absence of market  research.   That  was  not  an  irrational
    stance for the respondent to take.

59. The respondent also expressed  concern  about  the  absence  of  market
    research in relation to the franchise or restaurant business  to  which
    the applicant referred  in  interview.   Mr  Sarker  submits  that  the
    applicant was  asked  no  follow-up  questions  about  this,  which  Mr
    Lenanton accepts.  As I have explained above, however, any such lack of
    'probing' is to be seen in the context of the heavy onus placed on  the
    applicant by the PBS, the way in which he continued to switch from  one
    business venture to another, and the opportunity he had  following  the
    interview (as a result of the subsequent application)  to  address  the
    concerns which the respondent had already  expressed  in  the  February
    2019 refusal.  It would have been open to the applicant, in the face of
    that refusal, to submit a business plan for a Starbucks franchise or  a
    kebab house, showing that there was likely to be good footfall  in  the
    area and that  there  was  limited  local  competition,  amongst  other
    matters.  But he took no steps to do so,  as  a  result  of  which  the
    respondent's concerns remained.  In my judgment, there  was  no  public
    law  error  in  this  concern,  whether  as  a  result  of   procedural
    unfairness, irrationality or otherwise.


60. Under the sub-heading 'Further points' in  his  skeleton  argument,  Mr
    Sarker attempted to take issue with each of the  remaining  grounds  of
    refusal.  When pressed during the hearing, however,  he  very  properly
    accepted that the respondent was entitled as a matter of public law  to
    reach the remaining conclusions I have summarised at [8] above.  Whilst
    other decision makers might not have concluded that it was a matter  of
    concern that the applicant's business website had a  map  which  showed
    the company to be in Myanmar, or that he was not aware  that  employees
    were entitled to paid annual leave, these were obviously matters  which
    the respondent was rationally entitled to hold against the applicant in
    considering the credibility of his business and of his  claim  to  have
    created jobs in the UK.   Mr Sarker opted, in the circumstances, not to
    develop any freestanding submissions against these  points,  preferring
    to submit that they were insufficient to sustain the  decision  in  the
    event that I was with him on his three main points.   Since  I  am  not
    with  him  on  those  points,  I  need  not  consider  that  particular
    submission any further.


61. In the circumstances, the application for judicial review is refused.

62.  This  judgment  will  be  handed  down  by  email.  I  invite  written
    submissions from counsel on  the  form  of  the  order  and  any  other
    matters.

Postscript

63. This judgment was circulated in  draft  and  typographical  corrections
    were helpfully provided by both counsel.  Mr Sarker  sought  permission
    to appeal but submitted merely that this was an interesting case  which
    involved important principles.  I do  not  consider  there  to  be  any
    arguable error of law in my decision.  Nor do I consider this  case  to
    raise any important points which should be considered by the  Court  of
    Appeal.  Permission to appeal is accordingly refused.

64. Mr Sarker also submitted that there should be  no  order  as  to  costs
    because  the  applicant  is  reliant  on  friends  and  family  and  is
    struggling as a result of the pandemic.  No evidence of the applicant's
    impecuniosity has been  provided,  however,  and  this  case  has  been
    advanced (by privately instructed lawyers) on the basis that  he  is  a
    successful businessman who has invested tens of thousands of pounds  in
    the UK.  There is no  reason,  in  my  judgment,  to  depart  from  the
    ordinary rule, and I shall order that the applicant pays the  costs  of
    the Secretary of State.

Notification of appeal rights

A decision by the Upper Tribunal on an application for judicial review is  a
decision that disposes of proceedings.

A party may appeal against such a decision to  the  Court  of  Appeal  on  a
point of law only. Any party who wishes to appeal should apply to the  Upper
Tribunal for permission, at the hearing at which the decision is  given.  If
no application is made,  the  Tribunal  must  nonetheless  consider  at  the
hearing whether to give or refuse permission to appeal (rule 44(4B)  of  the
Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).

If the Tribunal refuses permission, either in response to an application  or
by virtue of rule 44(4B), then the party wishing to  appeal  can  apply  for
permission from the Court of Appeal itself. This must be done by  filing  an
appellant's notice with the Civil Appeals Office  of  the  Court  of  Appeal
within 28 days of the date the Tribunal's decision on permission  to  appeal
was sent (Civil Procedure Rules Practice Direction 52D 3.3).
