               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms J Todd, of Latta & Co, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. There is one ground of appeal to the UT, the nub of which is  that  FtT
    Judge A M S Green in his decision promulgated on 4 May 2017  failed  to
    consider evidence from two witnesses "that they have seen the appellant
    openly discussing Christianity with  others  who  are  non-Christians",
    which might have supported his assertion that he would  proselytise  in
    Iran.

 2. On reference to the statements of the witnesses, however they are  very
    brief on the matter of discussing Christianity, and say  nothing  about
    the involvement of any non-Christians.

 3. The appellant did not assert that any such evidence was given orally.

 4. The judge found that the appellant failed to  establish  to  the  lower
    standard that he is a Christian.  The ground of appeal  is  misleading,
    and does not undermine that conclusion in any way.  It  does  not  show
    that the judge overlooked any evidence which  might  have  led  him  to
    another conclusion, or which have might led him to go even further, and
    find the appellant to be a proselytiser.

 5. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

 6. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
