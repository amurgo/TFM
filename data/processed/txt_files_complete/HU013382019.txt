For the appellant:     Mr C Timson, instructed by Masaud Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr A Tan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appellant's appeal against the decision of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal panel comprising Designated Tribunal Judge McClure and  First-
    tier Tribunal Lewis promulgated 8.5.19, dismissing her  appeal  against
    the decision of the Secretary of State, dated 14.1.19,  to  refuse  the
    application made on  22.3.18  for  leave  to  remain  on  human  rights
    grounds.

 2. Designated Tribunal  Judge  Shaerf  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    3.6.19. Thus the matter came before us sitting as a panel in Manchester
    on 24.9.19.

 3. At the outset of the hearing Mr Timson applied for  an  adjournment  to
    enable the respondent to reconsider the decision in the  light  of  the
    fact  that  the  appellant's  husband  was,  in  August  2019,  awarded
    Universal Credit, a state benefit  allegedly  exempting  the  appellant
    from the income threshold requirement  of  Appendix  FM.  However,  the
    application was not supported by Mr Tan and  we  considered  that  such
    matters are  for  the  appellant  and  the  respondent  to  discuss  in
    correspondence or a further application.  We  concluded  that  we  were
    obliged to consider the appeal on the basis of the  sole  challenge  to
    the decision to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  which  permission  was
    granted.

Error of Law

 4. For the reasons summarised below we found  no  material  error  of  law
    sufficient to require the decision of the First-tier Tribunal to be set
    aside.

 5. The relevant background is that the appellant is a  Brazilian  national
    who, in Brazil, married a British national on 4.10.13, following  which
    she entered the UK in September 2015 with entry clearance and leave  to
    remain as a spouse. It  is  common  ground  that  entry  clearance  was
    granted on a mistaken understanding on the part of the respondent  that
    her husband was in receipt of Carer's Allowance, which is a  qualifying
    benefit  exempting  the  appellant  from  meeting  the  minimum  income
    financial threshold under Appendix FM. In fact, the husband was not  in
    receipt of Carer's  Allowance  but  Employment  and  Support  Allowance
    (ESA), which is not a qualifying benefit under the  Immigration  Rules.
    There is no suggestion  of  an  attempt  to  mislead  and  neither  the
    appellant nor her husband are responsible for the misunderstanding that
    led to entry clearance. It is also accepted that  entry  clearance  and
    leave to remain would not have been granted on the true facts  as  they
    were at the date of the respondent's decision.

 6. Fast forwards an uneventful three years of her probationary leave  and,
    within extant leave, in 2018 the appellant  duly  applied  for  further
    leave to remain as a spouse. This was refused on the sole ground  that,
    having discovered its original error and on a true understanding of the
    husband's benefit situation, she could  not  meet  the  minimum  income
    financial threshold under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules, because
    ESA is not a designated benefit within paragraph E-ECP3.3  of  Appendix
    FM,  and  does  not  exempt  the  appellant  from  the  ï¿½18,600  income
    requirement. In consequence, the application was refused, against which
    decision the appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.

 7. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Shaerf observed that  the  bulk
    of the grounds amount to no more than a disagreement with the  tribunal
    decision and did not disclose  any  arguable  error  of  law,  so  that
    permission was refused on those grounds.  We  respectfully  agree  with
    that assessment.  The fact that medical facilities in Brazil may not be
    of the same quality as those in the UK and that IVF fertility treatment
    may be financially out of reach, were not matters that could reasonably
    amount to insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing in  Brazil
    under EX1 and EX2, and could not reach the high threshold of article  3
    ECHR. In any event, we note that Mr Timson did not attempt to resurrect
    those grounds in his submissions to us.

 8. However, referring to paragraph 19  of  the  impugned  decision,  Judge
    Shaerf found it arguable that the tribunal erred in law in  not  taking
    into account the consequences of the  respondent's  error  in  granting
    leave on a misunderstanding as to the husband's state benefits.  Whilst
    entry clearance to join her husband in the UK should have been  refused
    on a true understanding of the facts, the appellant was in fact allowed
    entry with the  expectation  that  she  was  on  the  5-year  route  to
    settlement. It was considered arguable  that  the  tribunal  failed  to
    consider whether the respondent  should  have  exercised  its  residual
    discretion to grant further leave. Judge Shaerf granted  permission  on
    this ground only.

 9. Mr Timson pursued his submissions in a different and  more  narrow  way
    than either as was pursued at the First-tier Tribunal  appeal  hearing,
    or as expressed in the somewhat confused grounds. He did not rely on  a
    'legitimate expectation' as such. The oral argument advanced  was  that
    the impact of the error and the consequent years of family and  private
    life the appellant had been allowed to build  up  under  her  leave  to
    remain should have been given weight in the article  8  proportionality
    balancing exercise outside the Rules. It is asserted  that  the  First-
    tier  Tribunal  gave  insufficient  consideration,  if  any,  to   this
    consideration.

10. We find a number of difficulties with Mr Timson's approach.  First,  it
    is difficult to see why the appellant should have the  benefit  of  the
    original error in the grant of leave in a decision on  her  application
    for further leave to remain. It  had  been  argued  at  the  First-tier
    Tribunal appeal hearing that the respondent should have been  bound  by
    the error and  that  the  tribunal  need  not  consider  the  financial
    requirements. That was not an argument pursued before us by Mr  Timson.
    In any event, as the tribunal panel pointed out at [19], the appellant,
    in the UK on the basis of three years' probationary leave as a  spouse,
    had no legitimate expectation other than that she would be able to make
    a further application for leave and have that  application  decided  on
    the Rules in operation at that time. She was always going  to  have  to
    make an application for further leave to remain in which she would have
    to show that the Rules were met. If, for example, the husband had  been
    in support of Carer's Allowance in 2015 and the original leave had been
    correctly granted, but he was now in receipt  of  ESA,  which  did  not
    exempt the appellant from the financial requirements,  the  application
    could not have succeeded. As the First-tier Tribunal  panel  stated  at
    [19] the unfortunate history  "would  at  best  only  be  a  factor  to
    consider in the proportionality balance."

11. It was Mr Timson's argument, referring us to [51] of the decision, that
    no such consideration in  the  proportionality  balancing  exercise  is
    evident from the decision. However, given the content of [19], referred
    to above, as well as the various other ways in which the arguments  put
    at that appeal hearing were recorded in the decision, we are  satisfied
    that all due consideration was given.  It  is  not  necessary  for  the
    tribunal to make a detailed assessment, provided it is clear  that  all
    relevant and material considerations have been taken into account;  the
    arguments on this issue were very evidently at  the  forefront  of  the
    panel's mind. In any event, even if the First-tier Tribunal panel could
    or should have given more time or attention to that  consideration,  we
    are not satisfied that the error was material or could have resulted in
    a different outcome. We are not satisfied that the  error,  giving  the
    appellant the advantage of three years family and private life  in  the
    UK,  or  any  other  impact  of  that  error  for  which  she  was  not
    responsible,  would  be  sufficiently  compelling   circumstances   to,
    exceptionally, justify granting leave to remain outside  the  Rules  on
    the basis that the decision would otherwise be unjustifiably harsh.  No
    legitimate expectation was created by the error and  the  appellant  is
    not in any real way disadvantaged from the situation as it  would  have
    been had entry clearance been granted  without  a  mistake  as  to  the
    husband's state  benefits.  Whilst  one  may  have  sympathy  with  the
    appellant's situation, we find no legal basis  on  which  to  interfere
    with the decision. The grounds themselves  cite  the  decision  of  the
    Court of Appeal in Aisweh v  SSHD  [2019],  confirming  that  technical
    errors divorced from the factual  merits  of  a  case  are  "rarely  an
    appropriate basis for an appeal..."

12. Our attention was also drawn to the  appellant's  bundle  in  which  it
    appears that, post the decision of the First-tier Tribunal,  in  August
    2019, the  husband  was  awarded  Universal  Credit,  which  Mr  Timson
    suggested  would  be  sufficient  to  exempt  the  appellant  from  the
    financial  threshold  requirement.  Given  that  there  is  no  removal
    decision and given that it remains open to  the  appellant  to  make  a
    further application for leave to remain relying on Universal Credit, it
    is difficult to see how the decision of the respondent can be  regarded
    as now disproportionate. It follows that even if we found an  error  of
    law, which we do not, that error could not be sufficiently material  to
    require the decision to be set aside.

13. In all the circumstances, and for the reasons set out above,  we  found
    no material error of law in the making of the decision  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal.

Decision

14. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law.

     We do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed on all grounds.

Anonymity

We have considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order  pursuant  to  rule  13(1)  of  the  Tribunal
Procedure Rules 2014.
Given the circumstances, we make no anonymity order.
