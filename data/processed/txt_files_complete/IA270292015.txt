                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Astle promulgated on 2nd December 2015, following  a  hearing  at
    Birmingham, Sheldon Court on 30th November 2015.  In the determination,
    the judge allowed the appeal of the Appellant, whereupon the Respondent
    subsequently applied for, and was granted, permission to appeal to  the
    Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Liberia, is a male, and was born on  15th
    January 1988.  He appealed against the decision of the Respondent dated
    7th July 2015 to refuse to issue him with a  permanent  residence  card
    under Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.

The Judge's Findings

 3. The judge observed how the Appellant came to the UK in  September  2009
    and then met his partner, Hanna Holubova, a Czech national in  December
    of that year and they together moved in.  In 2008, she conceived and in
    January 2009 twins  were  born  to  them.   On  17th  August  2011  the
    Appellant applied for a residence card.  This was refused.  He appealed
    and succeeded in his appeal on 12th July 2012.  At the hearing, it  was
    conceded (see paragraph 6 of the judge's decision) that the couple were
    in a durable relationship.  The residence card, however, was  not  then
    issued to the Appellant until 7th May  2013.   That  aside,  the  judge
    recorded how the parties had lived together at three rented  properties
    during their time together, all the tenancy agreements  were  in  their
    joint names, they held a joint bank account, and they planned to marry,
    but had another baby on 13th June 2015 (see paragraphs 4 to 5).

 4. The Respondent, however, does not accept that the evidence demonstrates
    that the Appellant's partner has been exercising treaty rights  in  the
    UK continuously for five years.  Secondly, the Appellant's relationship
    with the Sponsor was not recognised until 7th  May  2013,  since  which
    date he has been classed as the family member of an EEA  national  (see
    paragraph 7).

 5. The judge thereafter made two specific findings.  First,  that  it  was
    not disputed that the Appellant's EEA partner had resided in the UK  in
    accordance with the Regulations for a continuous period of five  years.
    The issue in this regard was simply that the Respondent argued that the
    five year period only runs from the date that the Appellant's residence
    card was issued, namely, from 7th May  2013.   However,  as  the  judge
    held, the issue of a residence card simply confirmed status.   It  does
    not grant status.  This  is  clear  from  Article  25(1)  of  Directive
    2004/58.  It was true that the Respondent  only  issued  the  Appellant
    with their residence card in May 2013 but her  representative  accepted
    on 12th  July  2012  that  this  was  a  durable  relationship.   Under
    Regulation  7(3) the Appellant was to be treated  as  a  family  member
    (see paragraphs 10 to 11).  Second, the judge held that  whilst  it  is
    true that  member  states  have  a  margin  of  appreciation  in  their
    implementation of certain  provisions,  the  state  may  only  exercise
    discretion to impose requirements which do  not  deprive  the  original
    provision of its effectiveness: see Islam [2012] EUECJ C-83/11.

 6. The appeal was allowed.

Grounds of Application

 7. The grounds of application state that, although it was recognised  that
    the Sponsor was a durable partner and  the  Appellant  was  accordingly
    issued with a residence card on 7th May 2013,  the  Appellant  was  now
    applying for permanent residence, and in  order  to  qualify  for  this
    status, he had to  meet  the  requirements  of  Regulation    15(1)(b).
    Under Regulation 15, persons who shall acquire the right to  reside  in
    the UK permanently will be "a family member of an EEA national  who  is
    not himself an EEA national but who has resided in the  United  Kingdom
    with the EEA national  in  accordance  with  these  Regulations  for  a
    continuous period of five years".  It  was  made  clear  that  for  the
    purposes of the Regulations, an extended family member does not benefit
    from family member status until he is issued with  one  of  the  listed
    documents.  The family member status can then be retained only  for  so
    long as he continues to satisfy the  conditions.   In  this  case,  the
    residence card was  issued  on  7th  May  2013  and  consequently,  the
    earliest that the permanent residence could be acquired was on 7th  May
    2018.

 8. On 9th November 2016, permission to appeal was  granted  by  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

The Hearing

 9. At the hearing before me on 12th April 2017, Ms Aboni relied  upon  the
    Grounds of Appeal.  She submitted that the Appellant was originally  an
    unmarried family member but  he  was  treated  as  an  extended  family
    member.  He was now seeking permanent residence and for this purpose he
    had to show that he had five years residence from  the  time  that  his
    residence card was issued, namely, on 7th May 2013,  which  meant  that
    the earliest that the permanent residence could be  acquired  would  be
    7th May 2018.

10. For her part, Ms Kullar submitted  that  this  was  the  wrong  way  of
    looking at it because Article 25 is quite clear  (see page  24  of  the
    Appellant's bundle) that, "possession  of  a  registration  certificate
    ..... of a residence card or of a permanent residence card,  may  under
    no circumstances be made if preconditions for the exercise of  a  right
    or the completion of an administrative  formality,  as  entitlement  to
    rights may be attested by any other means of proof".  The  judge  dealt
    with this precise issue at paragraphs 10 to 11  of  the  determination.
    The judge confirmed that  Regulation  15  had  been  met  and  specific
    attention was drawn to Article 25.1 of Directive 2004/58.  Prior to the
    issue of the residence card the Appellant was recognised  as  a  family
    member and residence cards in  themselves  only  confirm  the  existing
    rights and do not grant them.   Indeed, a previous determination by  IJ
    Mallinson,  on  23rd  July  2012  (IA/05618/2012)   had   allowed   the
    Appellant's appeal precisely in recognition of this very point.

11. In reply, Ms Aboni submitted that she would have nothing further to add
    but to say that the five years' residence had to be in accordance  with
    the Rules and this was not the case here.



No Error of Law

12. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1)  of
    TCEA 2007) such that I should set aside the decision.  My  reasons  are
    as follows.

13. This is a case where the judge at the outset of her determination  made
    it clear that the Presenting Officer had confirmed that the  five  year
    period during  which  the  Appellant's  EEA  national  partner  had  to
    demonstrate the exercise of the treaty rights dated back from the  date
    of the  hearing,  namely,  from  November  2010.   Secondly,  that  the
    evidence confirmed that the Sponsor had been exercising  treaty  rights
    continuously during that period (see paragraph 2).

14. The dispute before the Tribunal (see paragraph 10) was  when  the  five
    year period should run from, and  the  Respondent  maintained  that  it
    should run from the date when the residence card  was  issued,  namely,
    from 7th May 2013.  However, such a proposition ran counter to  Article
    25(1) of Directive 2004/58 because the case of Islam  [2012]  EUECJ  C-
    83/11 makes it clear that, although member states  of  the  EU  have  a
    discretion to impose particular requirements, these  requirements  must
    not deprive the original provision of its effectiveness.   However,  it
    does not end there.

15. The Appellant had been issued with a residence card in  May  2013,  but
    the Respondent had accepted in the Tribunal hearing before IJ Mallinson
    (IA/05618/2012) on  12th  July  2012,  that  they  were  in  a  durable
    relationship and under Regulation 7(3) the Appellant was to be  treated
    as a family member.   The  judge  was  careful  not  to  equate  living
    together with being in a durable relationship (see paragraph  12),  and
    held that it would be appropriate to  pinpoint  this  date  of  durable
    relationship some nine months before the twins were born on 4th January
    2009.  There is, accordingly, no error of law.

Notice of Decision

16. There is no material error of law in  the  original  judge's  decision.
    The determination shall stand.

17. No anonymity order is made.

18. This appeal is dismissed.
