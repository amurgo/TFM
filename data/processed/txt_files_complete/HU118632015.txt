Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms Jaquiss, Counsel for Britain Solicitors, Ilford
For the Respondent:    Mr Diwnycz, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of  Angola  born  on  4  October  1972.   He
    appealed against the decision of the respondent dated 11 November  2015
    refusing him entry clearance as a partner  under  Appendix  FM  of  the
    Immigration Rules and also on Article 8 grounds outside the Immigration
    Rules.  His appeal was  heard  by  Judge  of  the  First-Tier  Tribunal
    Foulkes-Jones on 21 April 2017 and dismissed in a decision  promulgated
    on 11 May 2017.

 2. An application for permission to appeal was lodged and refused  by  the
    First-Tier Tribunal.  An application for permission to appeal was  made
    to the Upper Tribunal and was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Bruce  on
    8 September 2017.  The permission  states  that  while  the  First-Tier
    Tribunal directed itself to the appropriate principles  to  be  applied
    when considering the best interests of the appellant's children, it  is
    arguable that it failed to go on to make clear findings on that matter.


 3. There is a Rule 24 response from the respondent which states  that  the
    Judge has made findings with respect  to  the  best  interests  of  the
    children at paragraphs 23 to 27 and has stated that the status quo  can
    continue until the requirements of the Rules with respect to  financial
    and accommodation matters can be resolved.


 4. On 2 November 2017 the appellant appeared before me and  I  found  that
    there was  a  material  error  of  law  in  the  First-Tier  Tribunal's
    decision, as although at  paragraphs  21  to  27  the  Judge  has  made
    findings about the best interests of the children and  has  quoted  the
    relevant case law but she  has  not  reached  any  conclusion,  so  the
    children's best interests have not  properly  been  considered  in  the
    Article 8 balancing exercise.   The  balancing  exercise  is  therefore
    flawed and this is a material  error  of  law.   I  directed  that  the
    decision by First-Tier Tribunal Judge Foulkes-Jones should be set aside
    and I directed a second stage hearing.


 5. This is the second stage hearing.


The Hearing


 6.  A  supplementary  bundle  has  been  produced   by   the   appellant's
    representatives.

 7. The appellant's sponsor, his wife Mbilo Ikembo, a British citizen, took
    the stand.  She and the  appellant  have  two  children  who  are  both
    British.  Counsel for the appellant submitted that  there  has  been  a
    change of circumstances since the First-Tier  Hearing.   She  submitted
    that the sponsor now has a new job earning �20,800 per annum.  This  is
    with AGS One in Brighton and there is a copy letter from this  employer
    in the supplementary bundle.  In this bundle there are also recent bank
    statements.

 8. The Presenting Officer submitted  that  original  documents  should  be
    produced from the sponsor's new employer.


 9. The sponsor asked that her  statement  be  used  as  evidence  for  the
    hearing and Counsel asked her if the appellant has been to  the  United
    Kingdom to visit her and the children and she said he has, as he had  a
    five year family visit visa.  Counsel asked her if it  is  current  and
    she said it expired a few months ago.


10. The Presenting Officer questioned the sponsor asking when the appellant
    last visited the United Kingdom and she said in July 2017.  The sponsor
    attended the hearing before me in November 2017 and  the  sponsor  said
    that he had not left the United Kingdom in November, since arriving  in
    July 2017, so he was here on his visit visa.


11. The Presenting Officer asked the sponsor when she applied for  her  job
    with AGS One and she said she applied in April or May but checks had to
    be done so she did not start until 12 January  2018.   A  copy  of  her
    employment contract is in the supplementary bundle.   The  sponsor  had
    the original contract and the letter from the employers  with  her,  so
    the originals were available and I saw  them,  as  did  the  Presenting
    Officer.


12. The Presenting Officer made his submissions  relying  on  the  original
    refusal letter which is not based on new evidence.


13. Counsel made her submissions, submitting that at the First-Tier Hearing
    the financial requirements had not been  satisfied  and  there  was  no
    evidence of suitable accommodation.  There is now a  tenancy  agreement
    on file and the financial requirements can be met.


14. I was referred to the amendments to the Immigration Rules  relating  to
    children.  Counsel submitted that the Rules are now more flexible  even
    if the financial  requirements  cannot  be  met.   I  was  referred  to
    GEN.3.1.(1) and 3.2 and she submitted that the children  in  this  case
    are relevant children who are British and  are  under  the  age  of  18
    years.  She submitted that they would be affected badly by  a  decision
    refusing the application and she  submitted  that  there  are  credible
    prospective earnings from  the  employment  of  the  sponsor  and  that
    proportionality and Article 8 have to be considered.  I  was  asked  to
    give considerable weight to the employment contract and the letter from
    the sponsor's employer.  As the children are British she only  requires
    to earn �18,600 and I was also asked to  give  weight  to  the  tenancy
    agreement and the letter from Newham London Borough  giving  permission
    for the appellant to live at the sponsor's address and stating that the
    house is large enough for him to live with his wife and children.


15. Counsel submitted that with regard to Article 8 outside the  Rules  and
    the best interests of the children it must be in their  best  interests
    for the appellant to come to the United Kingdom to be with his wife and
    the children.  She submitted that visits are not enough and at  present
    the appellant does not have a visit visa and there is no guarantee that
    he will get another one as visit visas should not be used for  frequent
    and successive visits, which is what this appellant has been doing.


16. I was also referred to the Home Office IDI relating to Appendix  FM  on
    family life as a partner or parent and  private  life.   She  submitted
    that it would be unreasonable to expect  a  British  citizen  child  to
    leave the EU and the IDI states that it will usually be appropriate  to
    grant leave to remain when there is satisfactory evidence of a  genuine
    and subsisting parental relationship, which, she submitted, there is in
    this case.  The IDI states that there  will  be  certain  circumstances
    which outweigh the interests of a child and where leave to remain  will
    not  be  granted  but  these  examples  are  criminality,   very   poor
    immigration history, where  a  person  has  repeatedly  overstayed  and
    deliberate breaches of the Immigration Rules, and  she  submitted  that
    none of these are relevant in this case.  She submitted that  it  would
    in the circumstances of this claim, be unreasonable  for  the  children
    and the  sponsor  to  leave  the  United  Kingdom  and  that  in  these
    circumstances the appellant  should  be  granted  leave  to  enter  and
    remain.


17. It was pointed that at no time has  the  appellant  overstayed  in  the
    United Kingdom.  He has always been in the United Kingdom in  terms  of
    his visa and now that his five year visit  visa  has  ended  he  cannot
    visit his family in the United Kingdom.  She submitted that the  family
    is financially independent now that the sponsor has obtained  this  new
    job and that it must be in the best interests of  the  children  to  be
    with  both  of  their  parents.  She  submitted  that  it  would  be  a
    disproportionate breach of Article 8 if entry clearance is not  granted
    to the appellant.

Decision and Reasons


18. In this case the appellant  and  the  sponsor  are  in  a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship and have two children together born in 2006 and
    2008.  They are both British citizens and the sponsor is British.   The
    appellant has a visit visa and has visited on a number of occasions and
    the children are in full time education.


19. At the time of the First-Tier Hearing the financial requirements  could
    not be satisfied  and  the  accommodation  requirements  could  not  be
    satisfied.


20. I have considered Article 8 outside the Rules.   The  Rules  have  been
    relaxed relating to family life and Appendix  FM.   I  have  considered
    GEN.3.1.(1)(3)(8) and the evidence in the supplementary bundle.  I have
    also considered GEN.3.2 and I have to decide whether  leave  should  be
    granted  on  the  basis  of   Article   8   outside   the   Rules   and
    proportionality.


21. I have also taken into account the Home Office IDI dated in August 2015
    and the statement therein that it would be  unreasonable  to  expect  a
    British citizen child to leave the EU with his/her primary  carer.   In
    this case there is satisfactory evidence of a  genuine  and  subsisting
    parental  relationship  and  none  of  the  circumstances  which  would
    outweigh the interests of a child apply in this case.


22. A primary consideration  is  the  children's  best  interests  and  the
    Secretary of State's Section 55 duty.  In this  case  I  find  that  it
    would be unreasonable to refuse  the  appellant  entry  to  the  United
    Kingdom in the present circumstances.  He no longer has  the  means  to
    visit regularly and there is now a credible source of  income  and  the
    housing situation has  been  clarified.   The  best  interests  of  the
    children are an integral part of the proportionality  assessment  under
    Article 8 and  when  proportionality  is  assessed  and  the  balancing
    exercise performed, I find it would not be reasonable for  the  sponsor
    and the children to relocate to Angola and  that  the  children's  best
    interests are to be with both of their parents in the  United  Kingdom.
    Continued separation of the appellant from his children could result in
    unjustifiably harsh consequences for the children. The  appellant  will
    have good prospects of employment in the United Kingdom.  In this  case
    I find that there are no factors outweighing the best interests of  the
    children.




Notice of Decision

I allow the appeal under Article 8 outside the Rules.

Anonymity has not been directed.
