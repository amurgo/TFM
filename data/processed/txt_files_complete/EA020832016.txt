                            DECISION AND REASONS

    This is an appeal, by the , against  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Amerdeep Somal), made without a  hearing  on  1  August
    2016, to  an EEA residence card appeal by a citizen of Brazil. The only
    question was whether the  appellant's  EEA  husband  was  a  'qualified
    person' at the date of the decision to allow the appeal,  the  relevant
    date for this  purpose:  see  Boodhoo  (EEA  Regs:  relevant  evidence)
    Mauritius [2013] UKUT 346 (IAC).

 2. The judge had before her pay-slips for the appellant's  husband,  dated
    23 November and 23 December 2015, and 22 January and 23 February  2016.
    However she went on to find, without any further evidence, that he  was
    still employed as of 1 August. This was challenged by the Home  Office,
    and permission granted, on the basis that  it  was  a  finding  without
    evidence to support it.



 3. The evidence before the judge had  been  sent  in  by  the  appellant's
    husband with her grounds of appeal, received  11  February  2016.  That
    resulted in a notice sent them on 25 February, requiring a fee  of  ï¿½80
    for an appeal without an oral hearing, and another on 15 March,  giving
    them till 12 April to send in  any  written  evidence  or  submissions.
    Nothing was sent in at that stage, so effectively the evidence for  the
    first-tier appeal was closed on 12 April.

 4. While it might certainly have been arguable  that  the  appellant  only
    needed to show that her husband was working till that  date,  that  was
    not the basis on which the judge decided the appeal. There  might  well
    be cases where a judge  was  entitled  to  invoke  the  presumption  of
    continuance;  but  here  the  appellant's  husband  had,  between   the
    application and the decision under appeal, left the job on the basis of
    which the application had been made, without telling the Home Office.

 5. So the judge's decision cannot stand on the basis on which she made it,
    though I  sympathize  with  the  difficulties  facing  judges  deciding
    appeals without a hearing, and it has to be re-made, as of today. As it
    happens, the appellant's husband came with  her  to  the  hearing,  and
    produced  documents,  including  a  current  continuing   contract   of
    employment, on the basis of which Miss Isherwood accepted  that  he  is
    now a 'qualified person', for which reason the  appeal  is  once  again
    allowed.
