Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr R Pennington-Benton of counsel instructed by
                    Duncan Lewis & Co
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Morocco who was born on 3 February 1980.
    She has been given permission to appeal the determination of First-Tier
    Tribunal Judge R G Handley ("the FTTJ") who dismissed her appeal
    against the respondent's decision of 28 February 2013 to refuse her
    entry clearance to the UK for settlement with her husband and sponsor
    under the provisions of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.

 2. The respondent accepted that the appellant was exempt from meeting the
    requirements of paragraph E-ECP 3.1 as the sponsor was in receipt of
    Disability Living Allowance (DLA). In these circumstances the appellant
    would normally have to show that the sponsor was able to maintain and
    accommodate the two of them and any dependents adequately in the UK
    without recourse to public funds. However, the sponsor was in receipt
    of Employment Support Allowance ("ESA") as well as DLA and the
    respondent said that he was entirely financially reliant on public
    funds. The respondent "was not satisfied that you and your sponsor are
    able to maintain and accommodate yourselves and any dependents
    adequately in the UK without the course to public funds". The
    application was refused.

 3. The appellant appealed and the FTTJ heard the appeal on 24 September
    2014. Both parties were represented and the sponsor gave evidence. The
    FTTJ found that the sponsor was in receipt of DLA and exempt from
    satisfying the financial requirements in Appendix FM of the Immigration
    Rules. The appellant had to show that they were able to maintain and
    accommodate themselves in the UK without recourse to public funds.
    Whilst the FTTJ had before him a letter from the Criminal Injuries
    Compensation Authority confirming that the sponsor's compensation was
    assessed at �500,000, there was no evidence to show that this had been
    paid to his Deputy. There was nothing in the bank statements submitted
    to show any large sum which might reflect this level of compensation.

 4. The FTTJ accepted that at the date of the application the sponsor was
    receiving DLA of �131.50 per week. This was not a means tested benefit
    and the sponsor was not obliged to use it in any particular way. He was
    also receiving DSA of �119.85 per week giving a total income of �251.35
    per week. At the date of the application the rate of Income Support was
    �111.45 per week.

 5. The FTTJ said that the sponsor claimed not to pay rent for the property
    he lived in. He had produced a probationary Tenancy Agreement which
    indicated that he was obliged to pay rent and other charges. The FTTJ
    found that there was no documentary evidence before him to support the
    claim that the sponsor did not have to pay rent.

 6. The FTTJ found that the appellant had not established that she and the
    sponsor could be maintained adequately without recourse to public
    funds. Because of his findings that it had not been established that
    the sponsor did not have to pay rent or that he had received and had
    available to him substantial compensation from the Criminal Injuries
    Compensation Authority the appellant had not established that they
    would have available to them at least �113.70 per week, which was the
    required income support level for a couple.

 7. The FTTJ found that the appellant and the sponsor formed their
    relationship in the knowledge that she would need to make an
    application for entry clearance to the UK to join him. They had kept in
    touch with each other on a regular basis. There was little evidence to
    show that the sponsor could not relocate to Morocco because of his
    health problems. It was concluded that Article 8 was not engaged. The
    FTTJ dismissed the appeal under the Immigration Rules and on Article 8
    human rights grounds.

 8. The appellant applied for and was granted permission to appeal. The
    grounds submit that the FTTJ erred in law. Firstly, he failed to take
    into account the respondent's policy "Immigration Directorate
    Instructions, Chapter 8, Section FM 1.78: Maintenance". The respondent
    had failed to make a calculation detailing the actual financial
    position of the sponsor. As a result there were insufficiently clear
    reasons for refusing the application and the appellant was in no
    position to address the reasons for refusal. Secondly, the FTTJ failed
    to apply the correct standard of proof. On the documentary evidence
    before the FTTJ it was more probable than not that the sponsor had no
    obligation to pay rent for the property he occupied. The letter from
    the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority, an agency of the UK
    government, should have been accepted as sufficient evidence that the
    sponsor had received compensation of �500,000. Thirdly, the FTTJ had
    failed sufficiently to take into account the personal circumstances of
    the appellant and the sponsor in particular the sponsor's physical and
    mental problems and the lower standard of healthcare in Morocco when
    considering whether it was reasonable to expect the sponsor to relocate
    to Morocco.

 9. On 28th of January 2015 the appellant's representatives sent to the
    Upper Tribunal a skeleton argument, an index of the documents to be
    relied on, an application pursuant to Rule 15(2A) of the Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 ("the Procedure Rules") seeking
    permission to rely on additional documentary evidence, a supplementary
    bundle containing additional documentary evidence and an archived
    version of the relevant portions of the Immigration Rules in force at
    the date of the respondent's decision (28 February 2013).

10. The sponsor and his mother attended the hearing before me. In reply to
    my question and after taking instructions, Mr Pennington-Benton
    informed me that the sponsor's mother had attended the hearing before
    the FTTJ but had not given oral evidence. I confirmed with him that the
    123 page bundle on the Tribunal file was the one before the FTTJ.

11. Mr Pennington-Benton submitted that it was common ground, accepted by
    the FTTJ, that the sponsor had a total benefits income of �251.35 per
    week (which Mr Pennington-Benton calculated to be �492.70 per month).
    In addition he submitted that the FTTJ should have found that the
    claimant had an additional income of �20,000 a year because page 40 of
    the appellant's bundle before the FTTJ, which was part of the order
    made by the Court of Protection showed that "the Deputy may withdraw a
    sum not exceeding �20,000 a year from the funds of (the sponsor) for
    his use and benefit without needing to obtain the prior approval of the
    Court of Protection". This equated to �385 per week.

12. Mr Pennington-Benton submitted that, had he properly applied the
    standard of the balance of probabilities, the FTTJ should have come to
    the conclusion that the sponsor had received compensation of �500,000,
    all or a substantial part of this was available to him and he had an
    additional income in the region of �385 per week.

13. Mr Pennington-Benton submitted that the additional documentary evidence
    now produced made it clear that all the sponsor's rent was paid for him
    by the local authority although, in reply to my question, he accepted
    that what appeared to be the case was that the local authority paid
    approximately �106.61 by way of Housing Benefit and the sponsor paid
    the balance of approximately �7.53 per week.

14. He argued that the Procedure Rules permitted fresh evidence to be
    submitted and that this evidence was relevant to consideration of
    whether there had been an error of law. The reasons why the evidence
    now submitted had not been submitted earlier were contained in
    paragraph 12 of the application. The refusal letter should have
    detailed the financial calculations. It did not make it clear to the
    appellant why the application was being refused and what further
    information might be required.

15. I was asked to find that the FTTJ had erred in law, to set aside the
    decision and to remake it myself with no further evidence required
    other than that in the supplementary bundle. Alternatively, if I
    thought it necessary it would be possible to call the sponsor's mother
    who was his Deputy appointed by the Court of Protection.

16. Mr Tufan submitted that it was clear that in the refusal the respondent
    was putting maintenance and accommodation in issue. In addition to
    maintenance there was the question of whether the sponsor's landlord
    would let the sponsor and the appellant live together in the
    accommodation provided. There was a lack of clarity as to the
    landlord's position and as to the rent. Housing Benefit was means
    tested and could be affected by any income which the sponsor received
    from any Criminal Injuries compensation.

17. Mr Tufan argued that the application and appeal failed because the
    appellant had failed to provide the sort of documentary evidence which
    was clearly required in order to establish the financial position.
    Whilst it might now have been provided in the supplementary bundle it
    was not before the FTTJ and there could be no error of law by failing
    to consider material which was not before the respondent or the FTTJ. I
    was asked to find that there was no error or no material error of law
    and to uphold the determination.

18. In his reply Mr Pennington-Benton submitted that the question of
    accommodation or the landlord's permission for the appellant to live
    with the sponsor was never raised as an issue by the respondent. The
    appeal was about maintenance, nothing more. The only issue was whether
    the sponsor had enough income. He argued that on the evidence it could
    now be seen that the sponsor had more than enough.

19. I reserved my determination.

20. There is nothing in Rule 15(2A) of the Procedure Rules to indicate that
    fresh evidence not before the First-Tier Tribunal may be admitted
    specifically for the purpose of considering whether there was an error
    by the FTTJ. The reasons given for the late submission of this evidence
    and why it was not submitted to the respondent or the FTTJ was that the
    appellant was not aware of the detailed reasons for refusal of her
    application and therefore had difficulty in addressing these. Whilst I
    accept that the reasons given by the respondent were not as clear as
    they could have been I find it was sufficiently clear that the main
    issue was the question of the adequacy of maintenance. The appellant
    has experienced representatives and it should have been clear to them
    that the adequacy of maintenance was in issue and that it was necessary
    to produce oral and documentary evidence to substantiate this.

21. In a case where the sponsor has serious mental and physical health
    difficulties and the Court of Protection had appointed his mother to be
    his Deputy I find it surprising that, whilst I am told that she
    attended the hearing before the FTTJ, she was not called to give
    evidence. If she is managing his affairs it might be expected that she
    would be able to shed light on the position as to his compensation, how
    this was applied, what income if any was derived from it and what rent
    was paid and by whom.

22. It may be that the documentary evidence now contained in the
    supplementary bundle provides satisfactory answers to the questions
    which led the FTTJ to the conclusion that there were gaps in the
    evidence which meant that the sponsor's financial position was not
    shown with sufficient clarity for the appellant to establish that the
    maintenance requirements were met. The new documentary evidence begs
    the question of why it was not submitted earlier. There is no
    suggestion that it was unavailable.

23. In Ahmed (benefits: proof of receipt; evidence) Bangladesh [2013] UKUT
    84 (IAC) the summary prepared by the authors of the determination
    states:

          "(1)  In an entry clearance case involving the issue of adequacy
         of maintenance, it will in general assist the First-tier Tribunal
         or, on appeal, the Upper Tribunal if, as part of the submission, a
         calculation is supplied which reflects the comparison between the
         applicant's and sponsor's combined projected income if the
         applicant for entry clearance were in the United Kingdom on the one
         hand and, on the other, the amount required to provide the
         maintenance at a level that can properly be called adequate.

         (2)  Income received and the projection for the figures which the
         applicant and sponsor have to be able to find should be expressed
         on a consistent and arithmetically accurate basis. Benefit is
         usually calculated on a weekly basis but is often paid fortnightly
         (employment support allowance and income support) or four-weekly
         (child benefit), while tax credits are calculated on a daily figure
         and paid in general weekly (child tax credit) or fortnightly
         (working tax credit). A month under the Gregorian calendar is not
         the same as four weeks and wrongly taking a four-week period of
         income as equating to a month risks a potentially significant
         detriment to an applicant for entry clearance.

         (3)  It is always essential that regard is had to the benefit rates
         applicable at relevant times; eg in entry clearance cases, the
         rates in force at the date of decision. The calculation of the
         benefit threshold figure is an academic exercise, but establishing
         the benefits which a sponsor and the applicant will actually be
         receiving on the applicant's arrival is far from it. The most
         compelling evidence of receipt of income by way of social security
         is likely to be proof of receipt of funds into a person's bank
         account. Notices of award are intrinsically less reliable. The
         position of tax credits is particularly complex.

         (4)  It would assist if entry clearance application forms were to
         include questions designed to elicit the information described
         above and if decisions of entry clearance officers included a
         calculation described in (1) above."

24. Neither the Immigration Directorate Instructions cited in Mr Pennington-
    Benton's skeleton nor the case of Ahmed support his argument that the
    refusal letter should have set out detailed financial calculations made
    by the respondent. On the contrary, Ahmed emphasises the need for the
    appellant's representatives to provide detailed financial calculations.
    If detailed financial calculations had been provided it would be
    reasonable to expect that they would be supported by relevant
    documentary evidence.

25. The FTTJ set out the correct burden and standard of proof in paragraph
    6 of the determination. I can find no indication that this was not
    applied.

26. I find that on the evidence before him it was open to the FTTJ to make
    the findings he did both in relation to any compensation which might be
    payable to the claimant and the situation in relation to the rent for
    his accommodation. Whilst was accepted that the sponsor had been the
    victim of a very serious assault with serious consequences for his
    physical and mental health it was open to the FTTJ to say that he had
    little detailed evidence about this. Again, it may be that the
    sponsor's mother who is his carer and Deputy might have been able to
    shed more light on this. Although she attended the hearing before the
    FTTJ she did not give evidence.

27. I have not been asked to make an anonymity direction and can see no
    good reason to do so.

28. I find that the FTTJ reached conclusions open to him on all the
    evidence. There is no error of law. It may be, although I reach no
    conclusion in relation to this, that the evidence now submitted in the
    supplementary bundle, perhaps with further evidence, would satisfy an
    Entry Clearance Officer. If so the appellant's remedy may be to make a
    fresh application.
