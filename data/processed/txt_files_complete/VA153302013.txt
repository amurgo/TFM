                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

      Introduction


      1.    The Appellant (the Secretary of State) appealed with  permission
           granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Alan R Williams on 16  June
           2014 against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
           Pirotta who had allowed  the  Respondent's  appeal  against  the
           refusal of her application for entry clearance as a visitor in a
           determination promulgated on 16 May 2014.


      2.    The Respondent is a national of Canada, born on 24 August  1982,
           married to Mr Benjamin Luke Coleman,  a  British  Citizen.   The
           Respondent and her husband live in Canada.   She is a  non  visa
           national but had applied for entry  clearance  because  she  had
           previously been refused entry  clearance  on  arrival,  and  had
           subsequently  been  refused  entry  clearance  under   paragraph
           320(7A) of the Immigration Rules.  The present refusal had  been
           under  paragraph  320(7B).   The  judge  had  found   that   the
           Respondent had not  acted  dishonestly  such  that  the  earlier
           refusal under paragraph 320(7A) based on  the  circumstances  in
           2010 when the Appellant signed a letter  of  invitation  in  her
           then fianc�'s  name,  could  not  stand,  and  that  accordingly
           paragraph 320(7B) was inapplicable.


      3.    Permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  as  sought  by  the
           Appellant was granted because the judge had allowed  the  appeal
           without  making  any  findings  as  to  paragraph  41   of   the
           Immigration Rules  and,  perhaps  less  clearly  in  the  grant,
           because  the  finding  as  to  dishonesty  was  not   adequately
           reasoned.


      4.    Directions were made by the Upper  Tribunal  in  standard  form.
           The Respondent filed a notice pursuant to rule 24  opposing  the
           appeal.  It was contended inter alia that the paragraph 41 point
           had been conceded at the hearing.  The tribunal made the judge's
           record of proceedings available to the advocates  in  case  that
           clarified the point.




      Submissions - error of law


      5.    Mr Avery for the Appellant relied on the grounds and  the  grant
           of permission to appeal.  The decision was inadequately reasoned
           and the dishonesty finding flew in  the  face  of  the  admitted
           facts of what amounted to a forged signature on  the  letter  of
           invitation.  It was  unclear  from  the  record  of  proceedings
           whether or not the  paragraph  41  issue  raised  in  the  Entry
           Clearance Officer's decision had been conceded or  not  pursued,
           but certainly the determination  was  silent.   The  main  issue
           nevertheless was the judge's treatment of paragraph  320(7B)  of
           the Immigration Rules.  The judge failed to appreciate that  the
           provision was mandatory.  The  judge  made  it  clear  that  she
           disagreed with the provision, but it was for  the  judiciary  to
           apply the law, whether or not they personally  approved  of  it.
           The judge's conclusions were unsustainable in  any  event.   The
           Respondent  had  admitted  that  she  had  submitted  a   forged
           document, deliberately.  That was the end of the matter.


      6.     Counsel  for  the  Respondent  submitted  that  the  record  of
           proceedings indicated that there had been a narrow issue,  i.e.,
           paragraph  320(7B).   That  was  why  the   determination   only
           addressed that question.  It was important that  the  Respondent
           was a non visa national and thus had had no need to make a prior
           entry clearance.  When on a previous port refusal the Respondent
           had been refused leave to enter and granted temporary  admission
           for 3 days only, she had complied.  The present application  had
           been a protective measure.  It had been open  to  the  judge  to
           find as she had done that the  Respondent  had  made  a  foolish
           error of judgement which was not dishonest.  Perhaps it could be
           said that parts of the determination were inarticulate,  but  if
           the heart of the judge's findings were  considered,  i.e.,  that
           there was no mens rea, the determination should stand.


      7.    It was not necessary to call upon Mr Avery in reply.




      The error of law finding


      8.    The tribunal gave its decision at the hearing that the Secretary
           of State's appeal would be  allowed  and  reserved  its  reasons
           which  now  follow.   The  determination  was  prepared  by   an
           experienced judge but the tribunal was bound to  find  that  the
           judge had inadvertently fallen into material error of  law,  led
           by understandable sympathy  for  the  original  Appellant.   The
           record of proceedings was unclear as to whether the paragraph 41
           issues  had  been  formally  conceded  or  simply  not  actively
           contested.  No further information was available and it was  too
           late to seek the judge's observations.  In any event it was  for
           the judge to make the issues clear in the determination,  having
           indicated at [11(iv)] that paragraph 41 was a ground of  refusal
           by the Entry  Clearance  Officer.   It  was  obviously  for  the
           benefit of both parties that this was done.  That error  of  law
           alone was regrettably sufficient to require the setting aside of
           the determination, as it was fundamental to the appeal.


      9.    As to paragraph 320(7B), unfortunately the judge  had  expressed
           herself in strong language at [22] "It is  absurd..."  and  [25]
           "It cannot be logically argued...".  While judges  retain  their
           democratic freedoms, a determination is not the  place  for  the
           expression of personal  opinions.   Such  language  creates  the
           impression that the judge disapproved of the relevant provisions
           in the Immigration Rules and was biased against the Secretary of
           State.  The judge's reasoning thus became open to doubt.


      10.   The judge also said at [25] that there were  "strong  compelling
           compassionate circumstances" such as to make it  permissible  to
           "overlook the submission of the letter on this occasion in these
           particular  circumstances".   The   judge   referred   to   "the
           deception" in the  same  paragraph.   A  fair  reading  of  that
           paragraph is that the judge had found that there  was  indeed  a
           deception but that there was a discretion available to the Entry
           Clearance Officer and for  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  review
           under paragraph 86(3)(b) of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
           Asylum Act 2002.  It was not disputed before the  tribunal  that
           there is no such discretion because both paragraph  320(7A)  and
           320(7B) are mandatory.


      11.   While it is possible to see why the judge felt sympathy  towards
           the Respondent and her relations in the  United  Kingdom,  there
           was no scope  within  the  Immigration  Rules  for  the  judge's
           approach.  For all of these reasons, the tribunal finds that the
           determination contains material errors of law, such that it must
           be set aside and remade.  The Secretary of State's appeal to the
           Upper Tribunal is allowed.




      Discussion and fresh decision


      12.   The parties were present and willing to proceed immediately to a
           rehearing, rather than defer the  rehearing  to  a  later  date.
           The parties will henceforth be referred to by  their  First-tier
           Tribunal titles.


      13.   Mrs Suzanne Parkey ("Mrs Parkey") gave evidence on behalf of the
           Appellant as her sponsor, confirming as true and adopting as her
           evidence in chief her witness statement dated 7 May  2014.   The
           Appellant and her husband (Mrs Parkey's son) were  well  settled
           in Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada which had been their  home
           for some years.  Both were very happy with their lives there and
           there was no question of the Appellant's settling in the  United
           Kingdom or overstaying her visit visa.  The plan  had  been  for
           the Appellant and her husband to come to the United Kingdom  for
           a family birthday celebration, for two weeks.


      14.   The Appellant had  been  advised  to  make  an  entry  clearance
           application as a safeguard after  the  deb�cle  of  refusal  and
           temporary admission.  She had been given a date for interview at
           the deputy High Commission in Vancouver, which was  a  six  hour
           drive.  The  letter  of  invitation  from  her  fianc�  had  not
           arrived, so with his permission she had signed a freshly printed
           copy of  the  letter  on  his  behalf  and  presented  it.   The
           Appellant hadn't asked for the interview date to be changed,  as
           she should in retrospect have done.  The paper she used was  not
           a United Kingdom  size,  so  she  was  challenged.   The  signed
           original arrived the next  day  in  Kamloops  but  she  was  not
           allowed to resubmit her application.  Her only intention was  to
           prove that she had been invited to the United Kingdom, which was
           true.  It was  a  huge  error  of  judgement.   Mrs  Parkey  had
           discussed this with her son many times.  He had thought that  it
           was ok.  It would have been better if the Appellant  had  signed
           "pp".


      15.   There was no cross-examination.


      16.   Mr Avery for the Secretary of State relied on the submissions he
           had made earlier in relation  to  the  material  error  of  law.
           Paragraph 41 was not live in view of Mrs Parkey's evidence.  But
           there had been admitted deception as to submission of a document
           which was not what it claimed to  be.   The  appeal  had  to  be
           dismissed.


      17.   Mr Pipe for the Appellant relied on his skeleton argument.   The
           relevant law showed that dishonesty had  to  be  proved  to  the
           civil standard, cogently, by the  Respondent.   AA  (Nigeria)  v
           SSHD [2010] EWCA Civ 773 applied.  There was  no  dishonesty  as
           the husband's signature had been placed as his agent on  express
           authority.  These were unique  circumstances,  which  showed  at
           most a foolish error.  There was no deception as  the  fact  was
           that the Appellant had been invited to visit the United Kingdom.
            (No Article 8 ECHR claim was pursued.)


      18.   The Appellant had a full  right  of  appeal  to  the  First-tier
           Tribunal as her entry clearance application had been made before
           the limitation to human rights issues was imposed.


      19.   Mrs Parkey was a frank  and  open  witness,  whose  unchallenged
           evidence the tribunal accepts without hesitation.  The  tribunal
           is satisfied that the Appellant has strong links to Canada where
           she and her husband are well settled.  The tribunal  finds  that
           the Appellant has the intention to return to Canada in the event
           hat she were granted a visit visa.  No other issues arose  under
           paragraph 41 of the Immigration Rules.


      20.   The difficult issue was the  refusal  under  paragraph  320(7B).
           Mrs  Parkey  candidly  recognised  that  in  February  2010  the
           Appellant  should  have  either  postponed  the   interview   in
           Vancouver or have made it clear to the Entry  Clearance  Officer
           that she had signed the letter of  invitation  on  her  fianc�'s
           behalf.   Instead  the  Appellant  presented   the   letter   of
           invitation as if it bore  her  fianc�'s  signature.  Despite  Mr
           Pipe's able and attractive submissions, with regret the tribunal
           is driven to find that paragraph 320(7A) was  correctly  applied
           by the Entry Clearance Officer  when  refusing  the  Appellant's
           application for entry clearance on 19 February 2010.


      19.   This was, in the tribunal's view, more than a foolish  error  of
           judgement.  It was presenting a forgery, with the  intention  of
           obtaining entry clearance with the minimum delay.  Although  the
           Appellant may not have given the matter much thought and was  in
           all probability distracted, it was dishonest, perhaps recklessly
           so. There is nothing in the agency point, because the  Appellant
           failed to state that she was acting as agent.  Had she done  so,
           it is doubtful that the document would have attracted any weight
           at all.    The fact that there was a genuine invitation  in  the
           post is immaterial for these purposes.   Equally  immaterial  is
           the fact that the Appellant was a non visa national, because the
           reality was that she would have faced refusal of entry clearance
           on arrival at port because of past difficulties.  No  doubt  her
           name is recorded.  It is obvious that  once  the  Appellant  had
           elected to apply for entry clearance, she was  bound  to  ensure
           that all of her documents were genuine and that the  application
           was honest in all respects.  She  made  a  declaration  to  such
           effect.


      20.   From  that  finding,  it  follows  that  paragraph  320(7B)  was
           correctly  applied  by  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  to   the
           Appellant's next  entry  clearance  application,  for  a  family
           visit.  The provision was mandatory.   No doubt the result  will
           seem harsh to the Appellant and her family, but that is the law.


      21.   The First-tier Tribunal's decision can only  be  remade  in  one
           way, that is,  that  the  appeal  against  the  Entry  Clearance
           Officer's decision must be dismissed.


      DECISION


      The making of the previous decision involved the making  of  an  error
on a  point of law.  The appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal  is  allowed.   The
decision    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Pirotta is set aside and remade  as
follows:

      The appeal under the Immigration Rules is DISMISSED
