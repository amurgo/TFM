                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 1st January  1956.   She
    appeals, with  permission,  against  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge T Jones) who in  a  determination  promulgated  on  7th
    February  2014  dismissed  her  appeal  against  the  decision  of  the
    Respondent to refuse entry clearance as a visitor under paragraph 41 of
    the Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules HC 395 (as amended).

 2. The background to the application is as follows.  On  11th  March  2013
    the Appellant applied for a visit visa in order to undertake  a  family
    visit to Mr Muhammad Anser who is her son.  She proposed to visit for a
    month and in her application form she set out  her  circumstances  that
    she received income from her son and that  was  set  out  in  the  bank
    statements provided.  Furthermore, it is plain from the matters set out
    in the application form and the documents produced that she had been  a
    regular visitor to the United Kingdom since 2002 and there had  been  a
    number of visits made by the applicant to the United Kingdom where  she
    subsequently returned to Pakistan.

 3. The Respondent refused that application  in  a  notice  of  immigration
    decision made on 2nd April 2013.   The  reasons  given  were  that  the
    Respondent was not satisfied that the application met the  requirements
    of the relevant Immigration Rule  with  particular  reference  to  sub-
    paragraphs (i), (ii), (vi) and (vii).  Furthermore, the  Respondent  in
    light of an answer given in the application form considered  that  Rule
    320(7A) applied on the basis that it was  asserted  that  she  had  not
    declared a material fact on her application form.   The  reasons  given
    were that at question 73 the Appellant was asked whether she  had  made
    an application for leave to remain in the United Kingdom  in  the  last
    ten  years  and  she  had  replied  "no";  whereas  she  had  made   an
    unsuccessful application to remain as a dependant of her son  in  March
    2011.

 4. The reasons given for refusal are set out in the notice of  immigration
    decision and the Entry Clearance Officer noted that she had  previously
    travelled to the United Kingdom and earlier applications  had  provided
    full details to satisfy the Entry Clearance Officer that  she  had  met
    the requirements as a visitor but that each case must be decided on its
    own individual merits.  In respect of her wish to  visit  her  son  and
    whether he could maintain and accommodate her, he did not consider that
    the documents showed that he could fund the stay  and  furthermore,  in
    relation to her personal and financial circumstances, she had  provided
    limited information about her circumstances and he  was  not  satisfied
    that she was living in settled circumstances in Pakistan.  She  had  no
    employment and had no income or assets of her own and she was supported
    financially by her son.  She did  not  appear  to  have  any  dependent
    relatives.  Thus the Respondent was not satisfied that  she  had  shown
    sufficiently strong ties to Pakistan and that there would be little  to
    encourage her to leave the UK on completion of a visit.

 5. The Appellant issued Grounds of Appeal and the matter came  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge Jones)  sitting  at  Taylor  House  on  16th
    January 2014.  At that stage of the proceedings the Appellant  was  not
    represented and the Sponsor attended to give evidence.  The Appellant's
    case was set out at paragraphs 8-11 of the determination.

 6. Dealing with the conclusions of the judge at paragraph  [14]  he  quite
    rightly considered the refusal under paragraph  320(7A)  as  the  first
    issue.  However having considered  the  documentation  before  him  and
    applying the appropriate standard and burden of proof, he did not  find
    there was any deliberate intention to deceive by applying the  decision
    of  AA (Nigeria) [2010] EWHC Civ 773 and thus he did not find that  the
    Respondent had discharged the  burden  to  demonstrate  that  paragraph
    320(7A) was met.

 7. He went on then to consider the case  under  paragraph  41  and  it  is
    further plain from his findings at [14], which are  not  challenged  by
    the Respondent before this Tribunal, that there  was  evidence  of  her
    settled  circumstances  and  her  documented  means  at  the  time   of
    application and thus he found she could meet paragraph 41(i), (ii)  and
    (vii).  Thus the only issue remaining related to (vi) as to whether  or
    not the Appellant had demonstrated that she would be able  to  maintain
    and accommodate herself adequately out of resources  available  to  her
    without recourse to public funds or taking employment.

 8.  In this respect the judge considered the Sponsor's evidence  and  that
    whilst he had provided evidence before that  had  satisfied  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer that  his  circumstances  were  such  that  he  could
    maintain  and  accommodate  her,  he  had  not  brought  the  necessary
    documents for this application and as the judge was  not  persuaded  to
    adjourn the hearing or allow time for them to be sent, he did not  find
    that paragraph 41(vi) had been satisfied.  Thus he dismissed  it  under
    that paragraph.

 9. The Appellant sought permission to  appeal  that  decision  putting  in
    substantial grounds and whilst the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  refused
    permission, Upper Tribunal Judge Gill granted permission.  The  reasons
    given are as follows:-

         "It is arguable that judge T Jones may have erred in law by failing
         to  engage  with  the  evidence  of   the   Appellant's   financial
         circumstances that was before him and his failure to give  any,  or
         any adequate, reasons for his conclusion that the Appellant did not
         satisfy the requirements of paragraph 41(vii)."

    (This should have been (vi)).  The notice that went out to the  parties
    also contained the following:-

         "Proposal to set aside and remake the decision.

         The Respondent to take notice.

         For  the  reasons  given  above,  the  Upper  Tribunal  is  of  the
         preliminary view that the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
         dismiss the appeal does involve the making of an error of law  such
         that it falls to be set aside.  The  Upper  Tribunal  is  therefore
         minded to set aside the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
         dismiss the appeal and to proceed to remake that  decision,  unless
         the Respondent gives good reasons for objecting to that  course  of
         action in a response submitted under Rule 24 within  fourteen  days
         of the date on which this decision is dispatched to the parties.

         The Respondent is on notice that, if no such response  is  received
         within the specified period, the  Upper  Tribunal  may  proceed  to
         decide this appeal in the manner proposed and to  assume  that  the
         Respondent has no case to advance against  the  proposal  described
         above."

10. There is a further notice to the Appellant and the Respondent that

         "if the Upper Tribunal sets aside the decision  of  the  First-tier
         Tribunal, it is minded to remit the case to the First-tier Tribunal
         to be heard afresh by a Judge of the First-tier Tribunal other than
         Judge T Jones.  If the parties object to this proposal,  they  must
         notify the Upper Tribunal of their  objection  and  their  reasons,
         within fourteen  days  of  the  date  on  which  the  decision  was
         dispatched to the parties."

11. Despite the notices set out by Judge Gill on 15th May 2014  and  served
    upon both parties, there has been no compliance with that  notice.   In
    respect of the Respondent, the Upper Tribunal made it plain that having
    taken the view that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did involve
    the making of an error of law such that it fell to  be  set  aside  and
    therefore intended to remake that decision unless the  Respondent  gave
    good reason for objecting to that course of action, no such  reply  was
    received either within the fourteen days of 15th May 2014 or indeed  at
    any time up until this case  was  listed  before  the  Upper  Tribunal.
    There is no Rule 24 response either.  In respect of the Appellant,  the
    notice made it clear that it was minded to remit the case  unless  that
    proposal was objected to by either the  Respondent  or  the  Appellant.
    Again, no communication was received on behalf of the Appellant or  the
    Respondent.

12. Thus the appeal came before the Upper Tribunal.  Mr Tarlow on behalf of
    the Secretary of State submitted that  he  could  not  argue  with  the
    direction given by Ms Gill that the appeal did involve the making of an
    error of law  and  that  the  appeal  should  proceed  to  remake  that
    decision.  Mr Hussain, Counsel who appeared on behalf of the  Appellant
    submitted that it was not necessary for the appeal to  be  remitted  to
    the First-tier Tribunal  and  that  there  was  sufficient  information
    before the Upper Tribunal to remake the decision itself. There had  not
    been any further evidence  provided  by  the  appellant  prior  to  the
    hearing in accordance with the directions and the sponsor  was  not  in
    attendance. However Mr Hussain was content to proceed as the  case  was
    advanced on the basis of the  documents  submitted  on  behalf  of  the
    appellant.   In those circumstances, I heard submissions from  each  of
    the parties.

13.  Mr Hussain submitted that the basis of the error of law  related  only
    to paragraph 41(vi) and in effect only to the issue of maintenance.  As
    to accommodation, the refusal decision did not deal  specifically  with
    the issue of accommodation but in any event  at  paragraph  11  of  the
    determination,  it  was  recorded  that  the  Appellant  owned  a  four
    bedroomed house occupied by him and his wife and two children and  thus
    there was room for his mother to visit.  Indeed, she has stayed at  his
    property for the visits that have taken place over the years and by all
    intents and purposes it is the same property.

14.   Then he referred the Tribunal to the documentation  relating  to  her
    financial  circumstances.   He  submitted  that   the   judge,   whilst
    acknowledging at [14]  that  there  was  evidence  of  the  Appellant's
    financial standing before him failed to give  regard  to  it.   However
    looking at it now, the Appellant had adduced evidence of her  financial
    means having provided statements from two bank  accounts  in  her  name
    showing that at the date of decision there was a balance of  936,911.72
    rupees equating to �6,246 [see 23 and 24] and  also  a  second  account
    showing  a  smaller  balance  of  30,613.58  rupees  which  Mr  Hussain
    calculated to be approximately �204.  He also pointed to the history of
    that account which had been disclosed showing substantial  balances  in
    excess of this amount.  The application form in addition indicated that
    the Appellant was supported by her son and husband and  that  had  been
    explained by the evidence adduced.  In those circumstances he submitted
    that she had demonstrated that based on her finances that she did  have
    sufficient money, irrespective of the Sponsor's means  to  satisfy  the
    Rules.

15. Mr Tarlow made no submissions  save  that  he  relied  on  the  refusal
    letter.

16. In those circumstances I reserved my determination.

17. It is plain from the determination of the First-tier Tribunal that  the
    judge resolved the issue concerning paragraph 320(7A) in favour of  the
    Appellant in that he did not find that the Respondent could demonstrate
    that that paragraph should be upheld for the reasons that  he  gave  at
    [14].  There is no appeal against that decision.  Furthermore, he found
    that there was evidence of her settled circumstances and her documented
    means at the time of the application and therefore found that paragraph
    41(i) which dealt with the  Appellant  genuinely  seeking  entry  as  a
    visitor for a limited period was  satisfied  and  also  (ii)  that  she
    intended to leave the United Kingdom at the end of the  period  of  the
    visit as stated by her.  Presumably the judge was satisfied as  to  her
    immigration history and the number of visits that she had made  to  the
    United Kingdom.  He also found that she could  meet  the  cost  of  her
    return and outward journey and thus the only paragraph  that  he  found
    she could not meet related to paragraph 41(vi)  concerning  maintenance
    and accommodation.

18.   I consider that Mr Hussain is right that the issue  of  accommodation
    as such was not raised factually within the refusal letter and even  if
    it were, it is plain from the  determination  of  the  judge  that  the
    Appellant would be staying with her son in his  four  bedroom  property
    occupied by him and his two children.  This is the  property  that  she
    had stayed at before and therefore it  could  not  be  said  that  that
    property would not be available for her nor would  it  be  suitable  to
    house her for a short family visit.

19. Where the judge fell in error was his failure to consider the  evidence
    that had been provided concerning the financial  circumstances  of  the
    Appellant as to her own  financial  means  rather  than  those  of  the
    Sponsor.  In this respect, the judge was in error as the Appellant  had
    adduced evidence of her financial means available for her stay  in  the
    United Kingdom.  In this respect there were copies of  bank  statements
    for two accounts which had been referred to in  the  application  form.
    She clearly stated that she was bringing �1,200 with her to  cover  her
    maintenance but in any event the two account numbers  disclosed  showed
    at the date of decision a substantial balance equating to  �6,246  [see
    23-24] and a smaller amount of 30,613  rupees  which  is  approximately
    �204.  The account and  its  history  was  also  produced  showing  the
    history of that account showing substantial balances in the past.

20. Therefore in remaking the decision, I am satisfied on  the  balance  of
    probabilities that the Appellant has  demonstrated  that  she  had  the
    financial means of her own to demonstrate that she would be  maintained
    and accommodated adequately out of resources available to her as at the
    date of decision without recourse to public funds or taking employment.







Decision

21. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    on a point of law.  The decision is set aside.  The decision is  remade
    as follows.  The appeal is allowed.
