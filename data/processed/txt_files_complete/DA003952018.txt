Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms L Fenney, instructed by NLS Solicitors (Cardiff).

For the Respondent:    Mr D Mills, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a national  of  the  Czech  Republic.   Following  his
    conviction for aggravated burglary he was on 16 March 2017 served  with
    a Notice of Liability to Deportation in accordance with the Immigration
    (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations  2016.    On  28  May  2018   a
    Deportation Order was made against him under s 5(1) of the  Immigration
    Act 1971 by reference to the EEA Regulations.  A letter giving  reasons
    for the decision was served on the same date.

 2. The appellant had a right of appeal, which he  exercised.   His  appeal
    was dismissed by Judge Powell in the First-tier Tribunal.

 3. The appellant then sought permission to appeal on the basis that, as he
    was under 18 at  the  time  he  committed  the  offence  of  aggravated
    burglary, he fell within one of the exceptions to automatic deportation
    under s 32 of the UK Borders Act 2007: the exception is "Exception  2",
    contained in s 33(3) of the 2007 Act.  Permission was  refused  by  the
    First-tier Tribunal,  but  granted  by  Judge  Chalkley  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal, on the ground that the point was arguable.

 4. The difficulty, as we explained to Ms Fenney at the  hearing,  is  that
    although it is certainly true that a person who was  under  18  at  the
    date of the offence is exempt from the provisions of s  32  of  the  UK
    Borders  Act,  nobody  other  than  the   appellant   and   his   legal
    representatives have ever asserted that that act applies to this  case.
    This was not an automatic deportation under the 2007 Act, nor  was  any
    power under that Act invoked in the original  Notice  of  Liability  to
    Deportation, the Deportation Order or the letter of reasons for  making
    the order.   The  process  in  this  case  was  under  the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016 and the Immigration Act 1971,
    as we have said, those instruments contain no similar exemption.

 5. Ms Fenney acknowledged before us that the appeal  therefore  could  not
    succeed.  Indeed it cannot.  It is  dismissed.   The  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal stands.
