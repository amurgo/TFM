Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms H Price, Counsel, instructed by Eden Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   This is a spouse entry clearance appeal that was  initially  dismissed.
    Following a hearing at Field House on 19 September 2014 I decided  that
    the decision fell to be set aside.  My reasons for doing  so  were  set
    out in an error of law decision and directions.  This also set out  the
    immigration history, and is as follows.

          I. The appellant was refused entry clearance to settle in the  UK
             with his wife,  the  sponsor  Nasreen  Ahktar.   The  date  of
             decision was 13 March 2013.  The appeal was dismissed by First-
             tier Tribunal Judge  D  S  Borsada,  following  a  hearing  in
             Birmingham on 16 April 2014.


         II. Permission to appeal was refused on 10 June 2014 by First-tier
             Tribunal Judge Tiffen, but was then granted by Upper  Tribunal
             Judge Hanson on 7 August 2014.   In  granting  permission  the
             Upper Tribunal Judge referred to Goudey (subsisting marriage -
             evidence) Sudan [2012] UKUT 00041 (IAC), in which it was  held
             that  evidence  of  telephone  cards  was  capable  of   being
             corroborative  of  the  contention  of   parties   that   they
             communicated by telephone, even if the cards did  not  confirm
             the particular number that the  sponsor  was  calling  in  the
             country in question.  In addition the determination in  Goudey
             held  that,  where  there  were  no   countervailing   factors
             generating suspicion as  to  the  intention  of  the  parties,
             telephone card evidence may be  sufficient  to  discharge  the
             burden of proof on the claimant.   Having  noted  this,  Upper
             Tribunal Judge Hanson commented that the determination in this
             appeal arguably lacked adequate reasons as to the existence of
             such countervailing  factors.   It  was  also  noted  that  an
             arguable issue arose in relation  to  evidential  flexibility,
             and whether the  decision  maker  should  have  done  more  to
             request  missing  documents,  or  missing   information   from
             documents, before refusing  the  application  (Appendix  FM-SE
             para D(b)(i)(bb)).


        III. The sponsor attended the hearing before me, but I did not hear
             from her because the hearing consisted of submissions by  both
             sides as to whether there had  been  an  error  of  law.   The
             submissions by both sides at the hearing concentrated on three
             issues.  The first was whether adequate reasons had been given
             for the judge's finding that  there  was  not  a  genuine  and
             subsisting relationship (SS (Sri Lanka) [2012] EWCA Civ  155).
             The second was whether the  approach  to  the  telephone  card
             evidence amounted to a legal error of the type  identified  in
             the Goudey case.  The third was whether the  judge's  findings
             in relation  to  the  financial  evidence  were  supported  by
             adequate reasons.


         IV. The main submission by Ms Price, for the appellant,  was  that
             the judge, in paragraphs 6 and 7  of  the  determination,  had
             done little more than agree with the Entry Clearance  Officer,
             and with submissions made at  the  hearing.   Other  evidence,
             which supported the appellant's case,  was  not  mentioned  or
             referred to.  No account had been taken of positive  evidence,
             no reasons for suspicion or countervailing  factors  had  been
             identified, and the judge had not given any indication of what
             evidence he had taken into account  in  reaching  the  adverse
             findings.


          V. Mr Avery's main submissions were that the judge  was  entitled
             to make findings by reference to his own  earlier  summary  of
             the reasons for refusal and submissions at the  hearing.   The
             appellant and the sponsor had not provided much  evidence  for
             him to consider.   The  judge  had  not  taken  the  sponsor's
             absence from the hearing, through illness, to  be  an  adverse
             factor.  In respect of the sponsor's  employer's  letter,  and
             her payslips and bank statements,  requirements  of  specified
             evidence were not met, and it had  not  been  shown  that  the
             judge was wrong to accept this part of the refusal.


         Error of Law


         VI. I have decided that there was an error on a point of law  that
             was material to the outcome.


        VII. The first ground of refusal rejected the  statements  made  by
             the appellant and the sponsor that they were in a genuine  and
             subsisting  relationship  and  that  they  intended  to   live
             together  in  the  UK.   The  current  appeal   has   distinct
             similarities to  the  Goudey  case,  and  I  accept  that  the
             appellant has established that the judge in this appeal made a
             similar error to that identified by  Mr  Justice  Blake,  then
             President of the Upper Tribunal, in that case.  The  following
             comments are made in paragraph 10 of the Goudey case.


       VIII. "In our judgement the judge has mis-directed himself as to the
             weight to be attached to the total documentation  relating  to
             the  telephone  calls.   Whilst   it   is   true   that   this
             documentation does not of itself prove that  the  sponsor  has
             been speaking to his wife as opposed to someone  else  in  the
             Sudan, the material gives corroborative support for the wife's
             account in the entry clearance application and the appellant's
             testimony in the appeal.   It  is  clear  that  a  great  many
             telephone calls have  been  made  using  the  telephone  cards
             during the period of the relationship.   This  is  substantial
             support  for  the  proposition  that  they   conducted   their
             relationship by telephone.  It is  improbable  that  all  this
             communication was with someone else rather than the person who
             the sponsor has married and  wants  to  bring  to  the  United
             Kingdom."


         IX. In my view the above comments have direct application in  this
             appeal.  Whilst I accept that the judge was entitled  to  make
             findings by referring to his preference for  submissions  made
             on behalf of the respondent at the  hearing,  nevertheless  if
             those submissions that he accepted are analysed the  telephone
             card point was central.  The  only  other  reasons  given  for
             rejecting the genuineness of the relationship was  that  there
             had been no visits by the sponsor to the appellant in Pakistan
             since 2012, and the application had  not  been  made  earlier.
             These  are  not  matters   that   could   be   classified   as
             countervailing factors within the approach  suggested  by  the
             Goudey case.  At paragraph 12 of that case it was decided that
             it would be an error of law to find that  the  requirement  to
             show a subsisting marriage imposed some significant burden  to
             produce evidence other than that  showing  that  there  was  a
             genuine intention to live  together  as  man  and  wife  in  a
             married relationship.  It was specifically decided that  there
             was no requirement to show evidence of "intervening  devotion"
             in the form of letters or texts.  Paragraph 12  finished  with
             these words:


                "Where there  is  a  legally  recognised  marriage  and  the
                parties who are living apart both want to  be  together  and
                live together as husband and wife, we cannot see  that  more
                is required to demonstrate that the marriage  is  subsisting
                and thus qualifies under the Immigration Rules."


          X. In this  appeal,  referring  to  the  matters  raised  in  the
             refusal, and the submissions made at the hearing, it  is  hard
             to see that there were any countervailing factors  capable  of
             providing an evidential foundation for the suspicion that  the
             couple were not in a genuine and subsisting marriage.   It  is
             notable that it appears to have been accepted throughout  that
             the couple were married in Pakistan in 2011, as shown  in  the
             various documents and photographs, that  they  spent  a  month
             together after their marriage, and that the  sponsor  returned
             and spent another month with her husband in 2012.


         XI. I have  considered  whether  the  error  in  relation  to  the
             telephone  card  evidence,  and  the  lack  of  countervailing
             factors justifying  suspicion,  was  an  error  that  was  not
             material to the outcome because of the  financial  aspect.   I
             have decided that it  was  material,  in  the  sense  that  an
             adverse finding as to the genuineness of the marriage  was  of
             significance in any event, but I have also decided that  there
             are concerns about the financial aspect.


        XII. The judge dealt with the financial  ground  of  refusal  in  a
             brief paragraph [7] consisting of two sentences.  This  merely
             amounted to an indication that he agreed with the respondent's
             grounds of refusal and submissions, and that this had not been
             sufficiently addressed by the  appellant.   In  my  view  this
             cannot be said to amount  to  adequate  reasoning,  even  when
             allowing for the ability of a judge to  summarise  submissions
             and then indicate which ones he preferred.  The formula may be
             sufficient to amount to  adequate  reasons  where  issues  are
             tightly and clearly defined, but on this aspect  there  was  a
             range of financial evidence submitted  with  the  application,
             and with the appeal, and detailed submissions had been made by
             both sides.  There  is  also  no  mention  of  the  evidential
             flexibility aspect in the summary at  paragraph  3.II  of  the
             determination, with the result that this is an aspect that was
             not dealt with at all in the determination.


       XIII. I have therefore decided that the judge's decision falls to be
             set aside for error of law, and that the  decision  is  to  be
             remade, with no findings preserved.


        XIV. I have considered whether the matter should be remitted for  a
             fresh hearing at  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  or  whether  the
             decision  can  be  remade  in  the  Upper  Tribunal.    Having
             considered the Practice Statement  I  have  decided  that  the
             normal  course  of  remaking  in   the   Upper   Tribunal   is
             appropriate.  Although further fact finding is  necessary,  it
             is not extensive.  In  my  view  there  is  adequate  evidence
             already on the first ground of refusal.  The second ground  is
             more complex,  but  is  nevertheless  a  matter  that  can  be
             considered in a remaking hearing.


         Decision


         XV. The decision is set aside since  there  has  been  a  material
             error on a point of law, and the appeal  is  adjourned  for  a
             remaking hearing in the Upper Tribunal.

2.   At the start of the remaking  hearing,  at  which  the  respondent  was
    represented by Mr Bramble rather  than  Mr  Avery,  who  had  been  the
    representative at the error of law hearing, I  was  informed  that  the
    sponsor was not present because she had travelled to Pakistan to  visit
    the appellant.   Ms  Price,  for  the  appellant,  indicated  that  her
    instructions were to proceed, and that her view of it was that this was
    not problematic, because the remaining  issues  turned  on  documentary
    evidence.

3.   Following a brief discussion it was accepted by Ms  Price  that  I  had
    set aside the decision with no findings preserved, and had not made any
    findings in relation to remaking.  Mr Bramble, for the respondent,  was
    in a position to indicate that the subsisting marriage  aspect  of  the
    refusal was not being pursued.  He took this position in light  of  the
    Goudey point that had been the basis on which permission to appeal  had
    been granted, and the main issue in the error of law decision, but this
    also appeared to be supported  by  the  fact  that  the  appellant  had
    travelled to Pakistan for a further reunion with her husband.

4.   It was therefore agreed between the parties that the  remaining  issues
    raised in the refusal, dated 12 March 2013,  had  been  concerned  with
    specified evidence, in particular Appendix FM-SE,  paragraph  2(b)  and
    (c).  These related to documents  required  to  establish  income  from
    salaried employment.  The first issue was that  the  employer's  letter
    had not contained the required information.  The second issue was  that
    the personal bank statements corresponding to  the  wage  slips  (which
    were accepted) did not show that the salary had been paid into the bank
    account.

5.   Following the directions given at the end of the error of law  decision
    the appellant's representatives had obtained a further letter from  the
    sponsor's employer.  This confirmed that the sponsor had been  paid  in
    cash, rather than through a transfer  to  her  account,  but  Ms  Price
    accepted that the employer's letter obtained after  the  error  of  law
    hearing was still missing some of the information required in  Appendix
    FM-SE, 2(b).

6.   Following an opportunity for both sides to take instructions,  and  for
    Mr Bramble to obtain case files that he had not been provided with, the
    parties indicated  what  their  positions  were  on  the  bank  account
    question.  Mr Bramble, for the  respondent,  accepted  that  the  words
    "showing that the salary has been paid into an account" in Appendix  FM
    paragraph 2(c) could be complied with by a person who was paid in cash.
     There would still be a need for a correspondence to be  shown  between
    the cash payments on wage slips, and payments of cash into the account.
     Ms Price, for the appellant, indicated that her position would be that
    such a correspondence, showing regular payments of the salary into  the
    account, could be shown.  Ms Price also indicated that  the  solicitors
    could obtain a further letter from the sponsor's  employer  adding  the
    various pieces of information that  had  been  omitted  both  from  the
    original letter provided with the application, and the letter  obtained
    following the error of law hearing.

7.   Ms Price also made submissions in relation to the  discretion  provided
    by paragraph  D  of  Appendix  FM-SE,  which  provided  for  evidential
    flexibility in Appendix FM cases.  Her position was that  the  refusal,
    despite not having mentioned such a discretion, had in  fact  exercised
    it, through using the words  "not  satisfied",  and  as  a  result  the
    Tribunal could now exercise any discretion on the basis that there  was
    jurisdiction to decide whether  a  discretion  within  the  Immigration
    Rules should have been exercised differently.  She did accept, however,
    that there was no specific mention in the  refusal,  or  in  the  Entry
    Clearance Manager's review, about  paragraph  FM-SE(d),  or  about  any
    aspect of the discretion contained within  it,  either  concerned  with
    contacting  an  applicant  for  missing  information,  or  granting  an
    application despite the absence of a specified document.

8.   Mr Bramble, for the respondent,  then  developed  submissions  at  some
    length to the effect that any employer's letter not submitted with  the
    application was inadmissible in the appeal.  His  submission  was  that
    Appendix FM-SE D (the evidential  flexibility  provisions)  produced  a
    "timeline", and had the effect of rendering any evidence not  submitted
    with  the  application  inadmissible  in  the  appeal  process.    This
    submission appeared to draw an analogy with student and  other  points-
    based cases in which there was a requirement to show a particular level
    of funds for a period of time leading up to an application.  Mr Bramble
    did accept, however, in the course of  discussion,  that  this  was  an
    entry clearance appeal under Appendix FM, and that it was not a points-
    based system case.

9.   As for the other points at  issue  Mr  Bramble's  submissions  were  as
    follows.   There  remained  items  of  information  missing  from   the
    employer's letters.  The bank statements did not show that the earnings
    had been paid into the account regularly.  None  of  the  discretionary
    aspects in paragraph FM-SE D were applicable, and even if a  discretion
    had been considered it could have made no difference, because there was
    insufficient evidence.

10.  Ms Price, for the appellant, made submissions  as  follows.   The  bank
    statement at page  97  of  the  appellant's  bundle  did  show  regular
    deposits of the sponsor's salary.  This was after the sponsor was  told
    to pay her salary into the bank, and this predated the refusal.  Before
    that time the appellant had operated on a cash basis.   The  evidential
    flexibility Rules applicable showed that the decision maker could  have
    asked for further documents, or could have granted the application even
    if some documents were missing.  This was not a points-based case.  She
    provided and referred to the April 2014 IDI, which  she  said  had  not
    materially changed  since  the  decision,  in  relation  to  evidential
    flexibility in Appendix FM-SE cases.   She  relied  on  Appendix  FM-SE
    D(b)(ii) which gave the decision maker discretion to ask for a document
    where a specified document had not been submitted.   The  decision  was
    not in accordance with the law for a failure to consider  a  discretion
    that was available under the Rules.  It was significant that there were
    no allegations suggesting that any of the documents were  not  genuine.
    In relation to Article 8 Ms  Price  relied  on  the  original  detailed
    grounds of appeal, and she also asked me to consider Article  8  before
    turning to consider the not in accordance with the law point.

11.  At the end of the hearing I gave the appellant's  representative  seven
    days to submit a further letter from  the  employer,  with  seven  days
    thereafter for the respondent to make further written  submissions,  or
    alternatively to request  a  resumed  hearing  to  allow  further  oral
    submissions to be made.

12.  A further employer's letter was provided within the seven days, with  a
    copy sent to the respondent by fax.  By  20  November  2014,  something
    over seven days after the further letter was provided, I  was  informed
    that nothing further had been heard from the respondent.

Decision and Reasons

13.  In remaking the decision I have decided that the  appeal  falls  to  be
    allowed to the limited extent that the decision was not  in  accordance
    with the law, and the application remains outstanding.

14.  I will start by considering the remaining matters in the  refusal,  and
    the position under the Immigration  Rules.   The  issue  of  subsisting
    relationship and intention to live together in the UK was, correctly in
    my view, conceded on behalf of the respondent.  What remained were  the
    points about the missing information on the employment letter, and  the
    lack of bank statements showing that the salary had been paid  into  an
    account in the sponsor's name.

15.  On the first issue, the employer's letter,  I  am  satisfied  that  the
    letter that has now been provided, dated 10 November 2014, does contain
    all of the information required by Appendix FM-SE.   The  letter  shows
    the sponsor's employment and gross annual salary,  the  length  of  her
    employment, the period over which she has been paid the level of salary
    relied upon in the application; and the type of employment.

16.  I have considered the submissions made about the admissibility of  this
    letter.  It appears to  me  that  the  letter  is  admissible  evidence
    because it is concerned with the circumstances appertaining at the time
    of the decision.  It is therefore evidence that falls within  Exception
    1 in section 85A of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002.
    It is not evidence that falls within Exception 2.  This is because,  as
    was accepted at the hearing, the  immigration  decision  taken  by  the
    Entry Clearance Officer did not  concern  an  application  "of  a  kind
    identified in Immigration Rules as requiring to be considered  under  a
    'points-based system'".  The submission that paragraph D of Appendix FM-
    SE, which  concerns  evidential  flexibility,  could  somehow  override
    section 85A of the 2002 Act, and place non-points  based  system  entry
    clearance appeals in  the  same  category  as  in-country  points-based
    system appeals, where evidence is inadmissible if  not  submitted  with
    the application, appears to me to be misguided.  Neither does it appear
    to me to be arguable that the employer's letter somehow can be  equated
    with a points-based system timeline case.  The simple point to bear  in
    mind is that an entry clearance appeal can only be concerned  with  the
    circumstances of the date of decision.  The information in this  letter
    clearly  contains  information  that  establishes  what  the  sponsor's
    financial circumstances were at that date.

17.  The sponsor provided wage  slips  for  a  six  month  period,  with  an
    employer's  letter.   The  missing  items  of  information   from   the
    employer's letter have now been remedied.  What remains to  be  decided
    is the issue of the bank statements.

18.  There was confusion between the parties  as  to  what  bank  statements
    were in fact submitted with the application.  It is unclear whether the
    bank statements that were submitted were included in  the  respondent's
    bundle.  The single  sheet  at  page  97  of  the  appellant's  bundle,
    referred to by Ms Price, appears not to have been submitted.  It is the
    case, however, that it contains deposits for �294 each, and that two of
    these  predated  the  application,  and  the  other  two  predated  the
    decision.  There were then some further pages. The  account  given  was
    that the sponsor was unaware of the difficulties that would be  created
    by her operating her life on a cash basis, and that  she  only  started
    paying her salary into her account regularly when she was  given  legal
    advice that this was necessary for the purposes of the application.

19.  I cannot accept the submission made  on  the  appellant's  behalf  that
    this evidence is sufficient to comply  with  the  requirements  of  the
    Rules.  Although the issue of payment in cash was accepted not to be  a
    problem in itself, the requirement in the Rules  was  that  a  personal
    bank statement should correspond to the same period as the wage  slips,
    and that they should show  that  the  salary  had  been  paid  into  an
    account.  The situation here is that bank statements appear not to have
    been provided for the six month period covered by the wage  slips,  and
    corresponding payments only occurred at the very  end  of  the  period.
    The first payment was made on 21 December  2012,  and  the  application
    date was 26 December 2012.  By the time of the decision in  March  2013
    there were about eight deposits of her weekly salary.  In my view  this
    cannot be said to satisfy the requirement of personal  bank  statements
    covering the same period as the wage slips showing that the salary  had
    been paid into an account.  Having said that,  however,  I  accept  the
    submission made on the appellant's behalf that Appendix FM-SE paragraph
    D does contain a discretion  that  should  have  been  considered.   In
    particular there was a discretion under paragraph D(e).   This  applied
    where a decision maker was satisfied that there was a valid reason  why
    a specified document could not be supplied.  Here the  issue  was  that
    the sponsor could not meet the requirements because of her use of cash.
    In  these  circumstances  the  decision  maker  could  have   exercised
    discretion not to apply the requirement for the document, or to request
    alternative or additional information or documents to be  submitted  by
    the applicant, if satisfied as to this being a valid reason, a point to
    which I will return.

20.  The situation here is that the Rules appear to be  designed  to  ensure
    that the information contained in wage  slips  is  supported  by  other
    items of evidence.  The requirement was for three  items  which  should
    have corresponded with each other.  The  appellant  has  been  able  to
    provide two, but not the third.   In  my  view  the  explanation  given
    should be seen as a valid reason.  Once it is accepted that there is no
    fixed requirement for a sponsor to be paid by bank  transfer,  then  it
    appears to me that it must be valid for a sponsor to  choose  to  spend
    her wages using the cash that she has paid.  If the Rule  was  a  rigid
    one then the matter would be simple, but the Rule is  flexible  in  two
    ways.  The first is that there is no rigid requirement  that  a  person
    must be paid by bank transfer; and  the  second  is  that  there  is  a
    discretionary element allowing an application to be granted despite  an
    item of specified evidence being lost or missing.  The  issue  here  is
    exactly that contemplated at paragraph D(e), because it is a  situation
    where  the  specified  documents,  namely   bank   statements   showing
    corresponding payments, could not be supplied  (and  never  could  have
    been).

21.  The Rules contemplate the exercise of  discretion  in  two  ways.   The
    first is to grant the application anyway, not applying the  requirement
    for the particular document; and the second is to  request  alternative
    or additional information or documents.  It appears to me that it would
    have been open to the decision maker to follow either course, but  what
    was not  permissible  was  to  fail  to  recognise  that  there  was  a
    discretion to be exercised, and as  a  result  fail  to  exercise  that
    discretion at all.

22.  If the  discretion  had  been  exercised  the  application  might  have
    succeeded on the basis that the wage slips and employer's  letter  were
    sufficient, perhaps with some verification checks  being  conducted  in
    order to address any concern that the wage slips might not be  accurate
    or genuine.  Alternatively other  documents,  such  as  a  contract  of
    employment; P60s; or other tax documentation, could have been requested
    to offer additional support to the wage slips and employer's letter.

23.  I do not accept the submission made on the appellant's  behalf  that  I
    should regard the refusal as one in which the discretion  was  in  fact
    exercised.  In my view the only proper reading of the refusal has to be
    that there was no mention whatsoever of Appendix FM-SE paragraph D, and
    that there was a failure to exercise a relevant discretion  within  the
    Immigration Rules.

24.  I have considered the submission to the effect  that  consideration  of
    the discretion would have made no difference for other reasons.   I  do
    not accept that submission because, once the  genuineness  point  falls
    away, the only remaining issues concerned the employer's letter and the
    bank statements.  The first of these could have been  remedied  on  the
    basis of the discretion to grant applications despite minor  evidential
    problems, where a  document  did  not  contain  all  of  the  specified
    information required.  The bank statements issue could potentially have
    been remedied using the discretion applicable where specified documents
    could not be supplied for valid  reasons.   In  any  event  the  points
    related to the same central issue, namely whether the sponsor's  income
    had been properly established through documentary evidence.

25.  I have considered the request made on the  appellant's  behalf  that  I
    should deal with Article 8 before the submission about the decision not
    being in accordance with the law.  I have decided that that  would  not
    be the correct approach.  An Article 8  assessment  could  only  follow
    from clear findings that  there  was  a  failure  to  comply  with  the
    Immigration Rules.  In this case that does  not  appear  to  me  to  be
    established.  There was a concern underlying this submission about  the
    extent of any further delay.  My view on this, however, is  that  there
    will in any event inevitably be a need for the Entry Clearance  Officer
    to look at the current financial circumstances  of  the  sponsor.   The
    appeal has been concerned only with the  date  of  decision,  in  March
    2013, and that is now some time ago.  The Entry Clearance Officer  will
    now need to  look  at  the  current  circumstances,  and  will  not  be
    restricted to looking back in time to the previous decision date.   The
    Entry Clearance Officer will therefore be able to look  at  the  recent
    bank statements; the sponsor's P60 documents (including the most recent
    P60 showing that the sponsor earned gross pay of �18,964.78 in the  tax
    year to 5 April 2014); and the most recent employer's letter, dated  10
    November 2014, which contains all  of  the  information  required.   It
    would also, presumably, not be a difficulty for the sponsor to  provide
    a sequence of further up-to-date payslips.

26.  In short it appears that the application is likely to  succeed,  unless
    there is something unexpected of which I  have  not  been  made  aware.
    Documentary proof of  the  current  income  should  not  now  pose  the
    difficulties that have been discussed. It has now  been  conceded  that
    this is a genuine and  subsisting  relationship  and  that  the  couple
    intend to  live  together.   The  sponsor  has  remained  in  the  same
    employment throughout.  Her salary of  �18,750  per  year  was  already
    sufficient, but she had a pay rise to �18,964.78 on 6 March 2013.   Her
    employment  as  a  production  supervisor  is  permanent.   All   other
    requirements, including English language and accommodation,  appear  to
    have been accepted.  The sponsor also provided evidence of  savings  of
    around �5,000, but in view of her gross annual income there was no need
    for her to rely on these.

27.  I have considered whether there is  any  need  for  anonymity  in  this
    appeal, and have decided that there is not.  No  application  was  made
    for a fee award.  It appears to me that there were deficiencies on  the
    appellant's  side  in  respect  of  the  evidence  submitted  with  the
    application, but on the other  hand  there  were  deficiencies  in  the
    decision in that an important aspect of the Appendix  FM-SE  Rules  was
    not  considered,  namely  the  discretion  at  paragraph  D.   In   the
    circumstances it appears to me that it would be  fair  to  make  a  fee
    award for one-half of the �140 paid for the appeal.

Notice of Decision

28.  The First-tier Tribunal's decision dismissing the appeal is  set  aside
    for the reasons given above.  The decision is remade as follows.

29.  The decision was not in accordance with the  law,  on  the  basis  that
    there was a discretion within the Immigration Rules  that  should  have
    been exercised.  As a result the application made remains  outstanding,
    awaiting a lawful decision.
