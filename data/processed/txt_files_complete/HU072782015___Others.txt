                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr D Katani, of Katani & Co, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants  appeal  against  a  decision  by  FtT  Judge  Farrelly,
    promulgated on 15 February 2017.

 2. The appellants did not appear and were not represented in the FtT,  and
    their grounds of appeal to the UT, filed on 28 February 2017, were  not
    professionally prepared.

 3. Understandably, under those circumstances,  the  grounds  are  somewhat
    discursive and unfocused.  Their main points are these:

      i) The respondent was wrong to say they have had no leave since August
         2012, as curtailment of leave was not received until February 2014,
         and they were subsequently here pending their in-country appeal.

     ii) They could not attend the hearing "due to unfortunate  and  unusual
         circumstances".

    iii) The case went ahead without them, to their disadvantage.

     iv) Their "main lawyers" abandoned their case suddenly due to financial
         disagreement.

      v) A "legal aid lawyer"  deceived  them  by  promising  to  obtain  an
         adjournment and telling them not to appear.

     vi) The judge erred, based on the children having "spent  more  than  8
         years lawfully and continuously" in  the  UK;  the  impact  on  the
         children of relocation to Nigeria; and the  health  of  the  second
         appellant, who would be "sent home to an early death".

 4. On 1 September 2017 FtT Judge Easterman refused permission, on the view
    that in absence of any application to adjourn, there was  no  error  in
    going ahead; the grounds appeared to depend on matters which  were  not
    before the FtT; and the grounds disclosed no apparent error of law.

 5. The appellants repeated their grounds in an application to the UT.   On
    13th October 2017, UT Judge Coker granted permission, saying:

         "... it is arguable the judge failed to take proper account of  ss.
         117A - D of the 2002 Act, despite having quoted it in his decision.
          Although he describes the children's best interests  as  paramount
         that is clearly incorrect although nothing turns on that."

 6. Mr Katani, who had  been  instructed  by  the  appellants  only  on  15
    February 2018, argued their case by reference to MA (Pakistan) & others
    [2016] EWCA Civ 705 and to  the  respondent's  Immigration  Directorate
    Instructions (IDI's), appendix FM, August 2015.

 7. The key points I noted from his submissions were:

      i) MA and the IDI's exemplified the error identified in the  grant  of
         permission.

     ii) The error could also be approached in  terms  of  the  question  in
         s.117B (6), whether it would be reasonable to expect  the  children
         to leave the UK.

    iii) The judge overlooked the significance of the private life built  up
         by the children over a long period of residence.  He gave  that  no
         significant weight.

     iv) The real question  should  have  been  whether  there  were  strong
         reasons for refusing leave - MA at �46, the IDI's at 1.2.4.

      v) The decision at �17 and 19 did not disclose any strong reasons.

     vi) The judge made a slip at �19.  The  7-year  period  was  not  "just
         met".  In the case of the older child,  it  was  exceeded  by  some
         margin.

    vii) The judge failed to consider that moving the  children  to  Nigeria
         would be "highly disruptive".

   viii) Applying the correct approach to the evidence which had been before
         the FtT, the decision should be reversed.

 8. The key points which I noted from the submission by Mrs O'Brien were:

      i) The appellants had done nothing to show that any  unfairness  might
         have occurred through the proceedings in the FtT.  It was not clear
         whether the grant of permission covered that point.

     ii) The judge was bound to decide the case in the  end  by  an  overall
         proportionality assessment, human rights being the only ground open
         to the appellants.

    iii) Statute, MA and the IDI's did not indicate a rule that residence of
         children for 7 years was decisive.  The outcome turned on the whole
         circumstances of the case.

     iv) The appellants came to the UK  for  temporary  purposes,  so  their
         immigration status was always precarious; and  they  had  no  leave
         granted from 2012 onwards, the bulk of the period relied upon.

      v) The judge correctly found it not established  that  the  children's
         best interests would be adversely affected by the  family  removing
         to Nigeria.  No case had been advanced which might have led him  to
         conclude otherwise.

     vi) Far from being  a  case  with  only  one  proper  outcome,  as  now
         submitted, the evidence had not been there for  the  appellants  to
         succeed.

 9. I reserved my decision.

10. Cases may arise where  parties  are  deprived  of  a  fair  hearing  by
    circumstances which were not known to the judge and so could  not  have
    prompted  an  adjournment.   Such  circumstances,  however,   must   be
    established, not just vaguely asserted.

11. It is a very serious allegation that a lawyer  advised  the  appellants
    not to turn up and did nothing about their case.  The  lawyer  has  not
    been named, the matter has not been put to the lawyer for comment,  and
    no evidence has been advanced  from  the  appellants  or  anyone  else,
    although there has been plenty of time for steps to be taken.

12. The allegation has in effect been abandoned.  There is no basis for any
    finding of procedural unfairness.

13. The case based on health was exaggerated in the grounds beyond anything
    which was before the FtT.  The decision at �24  explains  why  it  fell
    short of showing a right to remain in the UK for medical treatment.  No
    error on that point is shown.

14. That leaves the matter advanced by Mr  Katani,  the  reasonableness  of
    expecting the children to leave the UK.

15. The judge was wrong to describe the children's interests as  paramount.
    They are a primary but not over-riding  consideration.   However,  that
    was an error  tending  in  the  appellants'  favour,  and  so,  as  the
    permission judge observed, not one by which the decision might fall  to
    be set aside.

16. The full section in MA  entitled  "Applying  the  reasonableness  test"
    should be set out:

          1. Even on the approach of the Secretary of State, the fact  that
             a  child  has  been  here  for  seven  years  must  be   given
             significant  weight  when  carrying  out  the  proportionality
             exercise. Indeed, the Secretary of State published guidance in
             August  2015  in   the   form   of   Immigration   Directorate
             Instructions entitled "Family Life (as a  partner  or  parent)
             and Private Life: 10 Year Routes" in  which  it  is  expressly
             stated that once the seven  years'  residence  requirement  is
             satisfied, there need to  be  "strong  reasons"  for  refusing
             leave (para. 11.2.4). These instructions  were  not  in  force
             when the cases now subject to appeal were determined,  but  in
             my view they merely confirm what is  implicit  in  adopting  a
             policy of this nature. After such a period of time  the  child
             will have put down roots and developed  social,  cultural  and
             educational links in the UK such  that  it  is  likely  to  be
             highly disruptive if the child is required to  leave  the  UK.
             That may be less so when the children are very  young  because
             the focus of their lives will be on their  families,  but  the
             disruption becomes more serious as they get  older.  Moreover,
             in these cases there must be a very  strong  expectation  that
             the child's best interests will be to remain in  the  UK  with
             his parents as part of a family unit, and that must rank as  a
             primary consideration in the proportionality assessment.

          1. Even if we were applying the narrow reasonableness test  where
             the focus is on the child alone,  it  would  not  in  my  view
             follow that leave must be granted whenever  the  child's  best
             interests are in favour  of  remaining.  I  reject  Mr  Gill's
             submission that the best  interests  assessment  automatically
             resolves the reasonableness question. If Parliament had wanted
             the child's best interests to dictate the outcome of the leave
             application, it would have  said  so.  The  concept  of  "best
             interests" is after all a well established one. Even where the
             child's best interests are  to  stay,  it  may  still  be  not
             unreasonable to require the child to leave. That  will  depend
             upon a careful analysis of the nature and extent of the  links
             in the UK and in the country where it is  proposed  he  should
             return. What could not be considered, however,  would  be  the
             conduct and immigration history of the parents.

          1. In EV (Phillipines) Lord Justice Christopher Clarke explained
             how a tribunal should apply  the  proportionality  test  where
             wider  public  interest  considerations  are   in   play,   in
             circumstances where the best interests of  the  child  dictate
             that he should remain in the UK (paras. 34-37):

             "34.      In determining whether or not, in a case such as the
                  present, the need for immigration  control  outweighs  the
                  best  interests  of  the  children,  it  is  necessary  to
                  determine the relative strength of the factors which  make
                  it in their best interests to remain  here;  and  also  to
                  take account of any factors that point the other way.

             35.       A decision as to what is in the  best  interests  of
                  children will depend on a number of factors  such  as  (a)
                  their age; (b) the length of  time  that  they  have  been
                  here; (c) how long they have been in education;  (c)  what
                  stage their education has reached; (d) to what extent they
                  have become distanced from the  country  to  which  it  is
                  proposed  that  they  return;  (e)  how  renewable   their
                  connection with it may be; (f) to what  extent  they  will
                  have linguistic, medical or other difficulties in adapting
                  to life in that country; and (g) the extent to  which  the
                  course proposed will interfere with their family  life  or
                  their rights (if they have any) as British citizens.

             36.       In a  sense  the  tribunal  is  concerned  with  how
                  emphatic an answer falls to be given to the  question:  is
                  it in the best interests  of  the  child  to  remain?  The
                  longer the child has been  here,  the  more  advanced  (or
                  critical) the stage of his education, the looser his  ties
                  with the country in question, and the more deleterious the
                  consequences of his return, the greater  the  weight  that
                  falls into one side of the scales. If it is overwhelmingly
                  in the child's best interests that he should  not  return,
                  the need to maintain immigration control may well not  tip
                  the balance. By contrast if it  is  in  the  child's  best
                  interests to  remain,  but  only  on  balance  (with  some
                  factors pointing the other way), the  result  may  be  the
                  opposite.

             37.       In the balance on the other side there falls  to  be
                  taken into account the strong weight to be  given  to  the
                  need to maintain immigration control  in  pursuit  of  the
                  economic well-being of the country and the fact  that,  ex
                  hypothesi, the applicants have no entitlement  to  remain.
                  The  immigration  history  of  the  parents  may  also  be
                  relevant e.g. if  they  are  overstayers,  or  have  acted
                  deceitfully."

          1. Although this was not in fact a seven year case, on the  wider
             construction of section 117B(6),  the  same  principles  would
             apply in such a case. However, the fact  that  the  child  has
             been in the  UK  for  seven  years  would  need  to  be  given
             significant weight in the  proportionality  exercise  for  two
             related  reasons:  first,  because   of   its   relevance   to
             determining the  nature  and  strength  of  the  child's  best
             interests; and second, because it establishes  as  a  starting
             point that leave should be granted unless there  are  powerful
             reasons to the contrary.

17. The submissions  on  reasonability  for  the  appellants  was  long  on
    generalities but short on specifics.  The judge found at �17  that  the
    children were doing well here but might do equally well in Nigeria.  At
    �19 he was not satisfied it was in their best interests to remain here.
     No error is shown in those findings.

18. There was no slip of any significance on the period  the  children  had
    spent here.  At �16 the judge states it as eight years.

19. Even on the alternative that there  might  be  some  advantage  to  the
    children in remaining here, the judge went on to find that would not be
    determinative, on the view that any advantage would  be  by  a  slender
    margin, and would not outbalance other factors, such as their return as
    a family unit, their mother being a medical  doctor  who  could  secure
    employment, and their time here always having been precarious at  best.



20. Mr Katani's submissions made the most of the materials from which  they
    had to proceed.  However, the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  is
    not shown to have erred in point of law on the best  interests  of  the
    children, on the reasonability of their being expected to leave the UK,
    or in any other such respect as might call for  it  to  be  set  aside.
    That decision shall stand.

21. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
