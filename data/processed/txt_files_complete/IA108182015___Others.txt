                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of the three  appellants  against  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Baldwin  promulgated  29.10.15,  dismissing
    their linked appeals against the decision of the  Secretary  of  State,
    dated 4.3.15, to refuse their applications for leave to remain  in  the
    UK as Tier 1 Entrepreneurs and dependent spouse (the second appellant).
     The Judge heard the appeal on 16.10.15.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Robertson refused  permission  to  appeal  on
    21.4.16. However,  when  the  application  was  renewed  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, Upper Tribunal Judge Goldstein granted permission to appeal.

 3. Thus the matter came before us on 17.6.16 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. For the reasons summarised below, we found  an  error  of  law  in  the
    making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  as  to  require  the
    decision of Judge Baldwin to be set aside.

 5. In granting permission to appeal, Judge  Goldstein  found  it  arguable
    that the First-tier Tribunal  made  adverse  findings  in  relation  to
    evidence that as a matter of law were excluded under section 85A of the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002; failed, adequately or  at
    all, to take into account the matters listed in paragraph  245DD(i)  of
    the Immigration Rules; and raised issues of its own motion that did not
    form the basis  upon  which  the  respondent  refused  the  appellants'
    applications and thus about which the appellants had no prior notice.

 6. At the outset of the hearing both Mr Malik and  Mr  Duffy  agreed  that
    Ahmed and another (PBS: admissible evidence) [2014] UKUT 365 (IAC) is a
    decision applicable to this case. Section 85A(4)  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 which  prohibits,  in  PBS  cases,  the
    reliance on evidence not submitted with the application,  also  applies
    to evidence relating to the non-points-scoring aspect of the case where
    it is provided that points will not be awarded if the decision-maker is
    not satisfied as to the non-points-scoring aspect of the case,  as  the
    two are inextricably linked. The prohibition is in relation to evidence
    that goes to the scoring of points. In essence, the appeal  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal should have  been  decided  only  on  the  evidence
    available to the Secretary of State at the time of the decision.

 7. However, it is clear from the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  that
    Judge Baldwin heard oral evidence from the entrepreneur appellants  and
    found that the concerns identified in the refusal decision,  "far  from
    being satisfactorily addressed by the appellants at the  hearing,  were
    magnified." The judge found aspects of the  oral  evidence  implausible
    and not credible, stating at ï¿½20, "They did not come across as  genuine
    Entrepreneurs and I could not imagine anyone having much confidence  in
    them being able to organise important  events  for  them."  Relying  on
    these findings about their oral evidence, later in the  same  paragraph
    the judge stated, "The business has not been proven to be  genuine  and
    likewise the intentions of the male Appellants have not been proved  to
    be genuine in relation to it. It would also  appear  clearly  that  the
    appellants have used  none  of  the  money  in  the  bank  account  for
    investment in the business. This, I find, strongly suggests they do not
    intend to do so and raises a real doubt as to the genuine  availability
    of this money to them for investment in the business."

 8. In the circumstances, we  agree  with  the  joint  submissions  of  the
    representatives before us to the effect that the findings of the  judge
    as to the issue of the genuine nature of the business, largely based on
    the oral evidence, were made in error of law.   The  error  of  law  is
    significant, going to the crucial issues in the case,  and  it  is  not
    possible to rescue the decision by attempting  to  separate  out  those
    findings which  did  and  did  not  relate  to  the  inadmissible  oral
    evidence. We cannot say that the outcome of the appeal would have  been
    the same  if  the  First-tier  Tribunal  had  confined  itself  to  the
    admissible evidence.

 9. When a decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside,  section
    12(2) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 requires either
    that the case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  with  directions,
    or it must be remade by the Upper Tribunal. The scheme of the Tribunals
    Court and Enforcement Act 2007 does not assign the function of  primary
    fact finding to the Upper Tribunal. Where the facts are  unclear  on  a
    crucial issue at the heart of an appeal, as  they  are  in  this  case,
    effectively there has not been a valid determination of  those  issues.
    The errors of the First-tier Tribunal vitiate  all  other  findings  of
    fact and the conclusions from those facts so that there has not been  a
    valid determination of the issues in the appeal.

10. In all the circumstances, at the invitation and request of both parties
    to relist this appeal for a fresh hearing in the  First-tier  Tribunal,
    we do so on the basis that this is a case which falls  squarely  within
    the Senior President's Practice Statement at paragraph 7.2. The  effect
    of the error has been to deprive the appellants of a fair  hearing  and
    that the nature or  extent  of  any  judicial  fact  finding  which  is
    necessary for the decision in the appeal to be re-made  is  such  that,
    having regard to the overriding objective in rule 2 to deal with  cases
    fairly and justly, including with the avoidance of delay, we find  that
    it is appropriate to remit this appeal to the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    determine the appeal afresh.

Conclusions:

11. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

                    We set aside the decision.

                    We remit the decision in the appeal to be remade de novo
                    in the First-tier Tribunal.

Consequential Directions

12. The appeal is to be relisted before the First-tier Tribunal sitting  at
    Hatton Cross, at the earliest convenient date;

13. The decision in the appeal is to be remade afresh on the basis  of  the
    evidence that was with the Secretary  of  State  at  the  date  of  the
    refusal decision, with no findings of fact preserved;

14. The appeal may be listed before any  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  other
    than Judge Baldwin and Judge Robertson;

15. The estimate length of hearing is 2 hours;

16. An interpreter in Bengali will be required;

    necessary for the proper listing and conduct of the appeal.



Anonymity

We have considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not  make  an  order.  Given  the  circumstances,  we  make  no
anonymity order.



Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

We make no fee award.
