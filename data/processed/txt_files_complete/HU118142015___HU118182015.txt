                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is the appeal of Malissa [A] and she is joined  by  her  daughter,
    [KA], who was born on [ ] 2012.  These are the two appellants and  they
    appeal against the determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge  Margaret
    O'Keeffe promulgated on 15 February 2017  after  a  hearing  at  Hatton
    Cross on 27 January 2017.  The two  appellants  are  both  citizens  of
    Jamaica.  The first, Malissa [A], was born on [ ] 1988.  Both  of  them
    appealed against the decision made by the respondent on 6 November 2015
    refusing their application for leave to remain in the United Kingdom on
    human rights grounds.

 2. The case arises in this way.  Both of them entered the  United  Kingdom
    as visitors on 28 October 2014.  The principal appellant, as a visitor,
    did not meet the Immigration Rules for leave to  remain  as  a  partner
    because visitors are not able to switch the capacity in which they seek
    further leave to remain.  The second appellant, who is  not  a  British
    citizen, has not of course lived in the United Kingdom for seven  years
    immediately preceding the application.  However, it should be  said  in
    relation  to  her  that  her  father  is  a  British  citizen  now   by
    naturalisation.  He became a British citizen on 13 December 2016.  That
    was a few weeks before the judge heard the appeal.   As  a  result,  it
    opens up the way for his daughter to  seek  British  nationality  as  a
    result of the position of her father.  Consequently, although  [KA]  is
    not at the moment a British citizen, she is capable on  application  of
    becoming one.  At the moment no reason was advanced why she should  not
    become one.

 3. As far as the husband is concerned,  we  assume  he  was  originally  a
    Jamaican citizen.  The couple  met  and  married  in  Jamaica  and  the
    husband has been in the United Kingdom for some time.   He  is  earning
    about �40,000 per annum but there was evidence before the judge that he
    earned some �50,000.  It follows from this that he is in a position  to
    meet the financial requirements of permitting his wife to join him as a
    spouse in the United Kingdom.

 4. The couple also have another child.  [KA] is presently  at  school  and
    [A] is, as I understand it, a British citizen.

 5. The determination of the judge was on the basis that the couple were in
    a genuine and subsisting relationship and they intend to remain  living
    together.  It is not disputed that [A], who  was  born  on  1  February
    2016, shortly before the naturalisation of his  father,  is  a  British
    citizen.  Accordingly, the issue before the judge was  whether  it  was
    reasonable  for  the  couple  to  be  separated  whilst  the  principal
    appellant, the mother, went to Jamaica to make an application for entry
    clearance.

 6. The effect of that would be that there is the  option  that  she  would
    take the two children with her while she made this  application.   That
    would be disruptive obviously as far as the children are concerned  but
    it would not be insurmountable.  She is  not  working  at  the  moment.
    Accordingly it would not impose any particular  burden  upon  them  for
    this to happen.  The father could continue  to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom and would continue to work but the issue before the  judge  was
    whether it was reasonable for  that  to  be  required  where  the  only
    substantial factor against it was that the policy of the  Secretary  of
    State is not to permit a visitor to change the capacity in  which  that
    visitor seeks further leave to remain.   There  must  be  a  very  good
    reason to depart from the policy but, at all stages, that  good  reason
    must be tempered by the duty to act proportionately in relation to  the
    individual circumstances of a case.  In this case there are,  it  seems
    to us, a number of factors which are significant.

 7. First of  all,  the  mother  has  never  been  in  the  United  Kingdom
    unlawfully.  She entered as a visitor and she made  an  application  to
    remain as a spouse and she did so during  a  period  of  extant  leave.
    Accordingly there was continuation of leave as  a  visitor  during  the
    period of this appeal.  She has never overstayed  and  her  immigration
    status has not been tainted by any action on her part which has led  to
    her being illegally in the United Kingdom.

 8. The second thing that we  think  can  properly  be  said  is  that  the
    children, whilst both of them are not British citizens,  both  of  them
    will be entitled to be British citizens.  I daresay in due course  that
    will happen.

 9. The third matter which we can properly extract from the papers is  that
    there does not seem to be any reason at all why  the  husband,  who  is
    earning a substantial amount of money, would not meet the  requirements
    of the Immigration Rules as a spouse and thereby  permit  the  wife  to
    succeed in her application.   Accordingly  the  reasonableness  of  her
    being required to leave the United Kingdom is on  the  assumption  that
    all she would be required to do would be  to  establish  those  matters
    which have already been established.  So, she  would  leave  to  go  to
    Jamaica, spend some time in Jamaica, make an application (which on  the
    face of it is bound to succeed) and then return.   In  issue  therefore
    was whether it would be reasonable for her to do that.

10. The First-tier Tribunal Judge did not approach the case  in  this  way.
    Although it was argued by Mr Tarlow that she appears to have  used  the
    yardstick of  reasonableness  in  paragraphs  38,  39  and  40  of  the
    determination, however in paragraph 41 she clearly identified the means
    by which she reached her decision.  She concluded:

         "On the evidence before me I find that there are no  insurmountable
         obstacles to family life being enjoyed outside the UK.  I find that
         temporary separation in order to enable the appellant  to  make  an
         application for entry clearance is not disproportionate."

    It follows from this extract from the determination that the judge  was
    certainly looking at insurmountable obstacles and disproportionality as
    being one and the same thing. In that the judge was plainly wrong.   It
    was  whether  it  was  reasonable  for  this  to   occur.    In   those
    circumstances we are satisfied that the judge made a material error.

11. We  can  then  go  on  to  consider  remaking  the  decision.   In  the
    circumstances of  this  case  the  public  interest  in  requiring  the
    appellant to go back to Jamaica and satisfy the requirements for  entry
    clearance as a spouse is really very limited.  There will obviously  be
    an interference with the family's life during the period of separation.
     For example, if both children remain in  this  country  or  one  child
    remains in this country, the husband will have to give up his work,  at
    least temporarily.  If both children go to Jamaica, that would  require
    one of the children to start  going  to  another  nursery.   It  is  an
    interference which is, in the  circumstances  of  this  case,  entirely
    unnecessary.  There is no public interest in making the point  that  an
    appellant, who is unlawfully present, should be required to  make  good
    her  illegality  because  the  mother  in  this  appeal  is  not   here
    unlawfully.   In  those  circumstances  we  find  that  it   would   be
    disproportionate to require her to make the application out of country.
     We allow the appellants' appeals on the remaking of the decision.

NOTICE OF DECISION

1. We find the First-tier Tribunal Judge erred in law.
2. We set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge.
3. We substitute a decision allowing the appeal on human rights grounds.
