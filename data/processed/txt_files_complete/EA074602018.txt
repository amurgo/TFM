Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr A. Malik, instructed by BWF Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr L. Tarlow, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen  of  Ghana  born  12  September  1981.   She
    appeals against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Harvard,
    promulgated on 29 January  2019,  dismissing  her  appeal  against  the
    respondent's decision to refuse to issue  her  with  a  residence  card
    under the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations  2016  ("the
    2016 Regulations").  The respondent's decision was dated 16 May 2018.



Factual background

 2. On 14 February 2018, the appellant applied for a residence  card  under
    the 2016 Regulations in respect of her marriage to  Anafieu  Jalloh,  a
    citizen of the Netherlands born 16 December 1986 ("the sponsor").   Her
    application was  refused  on  the  basis  that  she  had  not  provided
    sufficient evidence that the sponsor was a "qualified person"  for  the
    purposes of the 2016 Regulations.  For  the  months  July,  August  and
    September 2017, the appellant had provided two payslips for each month,
    in respect of her sponsor's claimed  employment.  Each  payslip  showed
    different amounts of pay. The sponsor's bank statements  purporting  to
    demonstrate his salary payments being made into  his  account  featured
    still further figures. The most recent evidence  she  had  provided  to
    accompany her application was from  30  November  2017,  predating  her
    application  by  over  six  weeks.   These  inconsistencies  lead   the
    respondent to question the weight the documents attracted.  He did  not
    accept the sponsor to have been economically active.

 3. The hearing before Judge Harvard took place  on  4  January  2019.  The
    appellant provided additional bank statements, payslips and  supporting
    documentation demonstrating that he  had  been  consistently  employed,
    with the most recent documents being up to the end  of  December  2018.
    These documents suggested that his annual income  for  April  2018  was
    ï¿½25,000. At [47], Judge Harvard rejected the submission advanced by the
    appellant that he was able to take into account  material  which  post-
    dated the respondent's decision. The judge said,

         "I am only able to consider the evidence which existed at the  date
         of the Respondent's decision, together with the evidence which  has
         been served subsequently but which relates to the period  prior  to
         the date of the Respondent's decision."

    The judge outlined why the materials provided in support of the initial
    application were inadequate and dismissed the appeal. He did,  however,
    accept an  explanation  provided  for  the  discrepancies  between  the
    payslips provided in the summer of 2017, and the presenting officer  on
    that occasion is  recorded  as  having  placed  no  reliance  on  those
    perceived inconsistencies.

Permission to appeal

 4. Permission to appeal was granted by the Upper  Tribunal  on  the  basis
    that the judge arguably  erred  in  law  when  refusing  to  take  into
    evidence which post-dated the decision. The grant of  permission  noted
    that, pursuant to Boodhoo and another  (EEA  Regs:  relevant  evidence)
    [2013] UKUT 00346 (IAC), the judge arguably had the power  to  consider
    evidence relevant to the substance of  the  decision  under  challenge,
    including evidence which concerns a matter arising after  the  date  of
    the decision.

Submissions

 5. Before us, it was common ground that the judge below had erred  in  law
    by virtue of his failure to consider the  post  decision  evidence.  Mr
    Tarlow conceded that the sponsor was economically active at the time of
    the application and invited us to find that there was an error of  law,
    and to remake the decision.

Legal framework

 6. Regulation 18(1) of  the  2016  Regulations  governs  the  issue  of  a
    residence card.  It provides, where relevant:

         "(1) The Secretary of State must issue a residence card to a person
         who is not an EEA national and is the family member of a  qualified
         person or of an EEA national with a right  of  permanent  residence
         under regulation 15 on application and production of-

             (a)  a valid passport; and

             (b)  proof that the applicant is such a family member."

    The essential issue in this matter  is  whether  the  sponsor,  an  EEA
    national, is a "qualified person". A "qualified person" is  defined  in
    regulation 6 to  include  a  "self-employed  person"  and  a  "worker".
    Meeting the criteria to  be  classified  as  a  "qualified  person"  is
    sometimes  called  "exercising  Treaty  rights",   referring   to   the
    entitlement enjoyed by all EU citizens to the right of  free  movement,
    conferred by the EU Treaties.

 7. Schedule 2 to the 2016 Regulations applies,  with  some  modifications,
    certain provisions of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002
    ("the 2002 Act") concerning  statutory  appeals.   It  provides,  where
    relevant:

         "1.  The following provisions of, or made under, the 2002 Act  have
         effect in relation to an appeal  under  these  Regulations  to  the
         First-tier Tribunal as if it were an appeal against a  decision  of
         the Secretary of State under section 82(1) of the 2002  Act  (right
         of appeal to the Tribunal)-

             [...]

             section 85 (matters to be considered), as though-

                  (a)  the references to a statement under  section  120  of
                  the 2002 Act include, but are not limited to, a  statement
                  under that section as applied by paragraph 2; and

                  (b)  a "matter" in subsection (2) and a  "new  matter"  in
                  subsection (6) include a ground of appeal of a kind listed
                  in section 84  of  the  2002  Act  and  an  EU  ground  of
                  appeal..."

 8.  Section 85(4) of the 2002 Act is one of the provisions applied by  the
    deeming provisions contained in Schedule 2.  It provides:

             "On an appeal under  section  82(1)  against  a  decision  the
             Tribunal may consider  [...]  any  matter  which  [it]  thinks
             relevant to the substance of the decision, including  [...]  a
             matter arising after the date of the decision."

    The effect of section 85(4), as applied by  the  2016  Regulations,  is
    that the tribunal  does  have  the  jurisdiction  to  consider  matters
    arising after the date of the decision in an EEA case.  This is subject
    to the important exception that the tribunal may not  consider  a  "new
    matter" without the consent of the Secretary of  State.   The  evidence
    under consideration in the present case was not a "new matter",  rather
    it was further or better evidence of an existing matter, namely whether
    the sponsor was exercising Treaty rights.

Discussion

 9. We indicated at the hearing that we agreed that Judge Harvard had erred
    and that we would consider the up-to-date  evidence  submitted  by  the
    appellant.  The Judge had the power to consider post-decision  evidence
    pursuant to section 85(4) of the 2002 Act, as applied by Schedule 2  to
    the 2016 Regulations.  This tribunal considered this issue in  relation
    to the predecessor regime to  the  2016  Regulations,  the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 in Boodhoo.  There, the  then
    President held, in the Headnote at [2], that

         "... a tribunal has power to consider any evidence which it  thinks
         relevant to the substance of the decision, including evidence which
         concerns a matter arising after the date of the decision."

    Although Boodhoo concerned the 2006 Regulations, for  present  purposes
    there is no material difference between the appeal provisions contained
    in  the  2016  Regulations.    The   underlying   statutory   provision
    considered in Boodhoo, namely section 85(4) of the 2002 Act, as applied
    by Schedule 1  to  the  2006  Regulations  to  EEA  cases,  remains  in
    materially the same form.

10. As such, the judge was incorrect to state that  he  did  not  have  the
    ability to consider post-decision evidence.  The sole issue in the case
    was whether the sponsor exercised Treaty rights; the evidence proffered
    to the judge  clearly  went  precisely  to  that  matter,  and  it  was
    accordingly "relevant  to  the  substance  of  the  decision"  for  the
    purposes of section 85(4).  The judge erred in law by refusing to  take
    into account relevant post-decision evidence.

11. We consider that the judge's failure to take  into  account  the  post-
    decision evidence amounted to a failure  to  have  regard  to  material
    evidence.  The post-decision evidence appeared to demonstrate that  the
    sponsor was a qualified person at the date of the hearing, and as  such
    the judge's error was material.

12. There is no need for this matter to be remitted; we are able to  remake
    the decision ourselves. It is necessary for us to analyse the  evidence
    submitted by the appellant  in  support  of  the  contention  that  the
    sponsor is economically active.

Remaking the decision

13. We recall that the sole basis upon which  the  appellant's  application
    was rejected was on the basis that he was not a "qualified person"  for
    the purposes of the regulations. There has been  no  challenge  by  the
    respondent to the assertion that  the  sponsor  is  a  citizen  of  the
    Netherlands, nor in relation to any of the other criteria which must be
    satisfied for the issue of a residence card.

14. The sponsor states in his statement prepared for the proceedings before
    Judge Harvard that  he  has  two  jobs.  He  is  a  sales  manager  for
    Providence Care and Cleaning Services Ltd, and also  works  on  a  part
    time basis at Meridian Manpower Ltd, as a healthcare assistant.  He has
    provided a P60 End of Year Certificate for the tax year to 5 April 2019
    in respect of his employment with Providence Care and Cleaning Services
    Ltd.  That document states that  the  sponsor  had  taxable  income  of
    ï¿½13,775.38 during that tax year. His employment  with  Providence  Care
    and Cleaning services is supported by a number of  other  documents  in
    the appellant's bundle. He has provided  a  letter  from  the  director
    dated 13 July 2017 confirming that he is in  the  company's  employment
    with an annual gross salary of ï¿½25,200.  This figure is consistent with
    the figure  which  features  on  the  P60,  once  the  annual  tax-free
    allowance available  to  those  in  the  position  of  the  sponsor  is
    accounted for. We take judicial notice of the fact  that  the  tax-free
    allowance is ï¿½12,500.

15. The sponsor is currently part way through a six-month  sabbatical  from
    Providence Care and Cleaning Services. A letter from  the  director  of
    the company dated 5 February 2019 was provided to us  at  the  hearing.
    During the sabbatical, the sponsor will not  be  paid,  but  all  other
    aspects of his employment will remain in force. We do not consider this
    temporary sabbatical - which coincides with the impending birth of  the
    appellant's child - to amount to the sponsor losing his links with  the
    labour market, such that he is no longer a worker or  even  a  retained
    worker. In any event, he remains in employment with his other employer,
    Meridian Manpower Limited,  and  has  provided  a  series  of  payslips
    administered by a  company  called  "Ezy  Solutions".   Copies  of  the
    sponsor's bank statements were provided to us at the hearing,  as  well
    as a selection of payslips for  earlier  in  the  year.   The  payslips
    demonstrate that he is paid weekly by Meridian Manpower Limited.   They
    display the following payments from Ezy Solutions:

|4 Jan 19           |ï¿½354.92           |
|11 Jan 19          |ï¿½225.28           |
|18 Jan 19          |ï¿½132.50           |
|25 Jan 19          |ï¿½279.00           |
|1 Feb 19           |ï¿½248.16           |
|8 Feb 19           |ï¿½266.52           |
|15 Feb 19          |ï¿½260.40           |
|22 Feb 19          |ï¿½179.16           |
|1 Mar 19           |ï¿½291.30           |
|8 Mar 19           |ï¿½116.92           |
|15 Mar 19          |ï¿½112.50           |
|22 Mar 19          |ï¿½184.80           |
|29 Mar 19          |ï¿½318.80           |
|12 Apr 19          |ï¿½318.88           |
|18 Apr 19          |ï¿½94.50            |
|26 Apr 19          |ï¿½182.93           |
|3 May 19           |ï¿½94.50            |
|10 May 19          |ï¿½94.50            |
|24 May 19          |ï¿½94.50            |


16. We find on the balance of probabilities that the sponsor is engaged  in
    genuine and effective work  with  Meridian  Manpower  Limited.  He  has
    demonstrated a course of conduct in which he has been engaged by  them,
    over a period of time. The evidence  took  us  to  shortly  before  the
    hearing. We find that the evidence demonstrates that the sponsor  is  a
    "worker" for the purposes of the 2016 Regulations. As  such,  he  is  a
    "qualified person" within the meaning of regulation 6.  The  appellant,
    therefore, meets the criteria for the issue of residence card.  She  is
    the family member of an EEA national who is a qualified person.

17. We set aside the decision of Judge Harvard and remake it in  favour  of
    the appellant. This appeal  is  allowed  under  the  Immigration  (EEA)
    Regulations 2016.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As we have allowed the appeal  and  because  a  fee  has  been  paid  or  is
payable, we have considered making a fee award and have decided to  make  no
fee award for  the  following  reason.   The  information  provided  to  the
respondent with the initial  application  was  plainly  inadequate  and  the
respondent's decision was open to him on the evidence then before him.   Had
sufficient supporting evidence been provided, these proceedings  could  have
been avoided.
