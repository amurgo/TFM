Representation:
For the Appellant:      Ms R Peterson, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:     Mr Butterworth instructed by Farani Javed Taylor
solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

      1. In an interlocutory decision, a copy of which is attached as  Annex
         1, Upper Tribunal Judge Martin set aside the decision of the First-
         tier Tribunal, allowing the appeal on  Article  8  grounds,  to  be
         remade, no findings preserved. A copy of the decision  is  attached
         as Annex 1. Neither Mr [X] nor anyone on his  behalf  attended  the
         hearing and the substantive hearing was adjourned; thus the  matter
         comes before me.

      2. The appeal by Mr [X] is an appeal against a decision by the SSHD to
         remove him to Germany under the Dublin III arrangements. There  was
         no challenge to the record of  the  evidence  as  set  out  in  the
         decision of the First-tier Tribunal. It was agreed that  there  was
         no need for me to hear oral evidence and no further documents  were
         submitted, the only additional information being provided was  that
         Mr [X]'s wife, Ms [TB], and the  two  children,  had  been  granted
         further discretionary leave to remain  until  8th  September  2019.
         Although no documentary evidence of this was produced, it  was  not
         disputed.

      3. Mr Butterworth relied upon Dasgupta (error of law - proportionality
         -  correct  approach)  [2016]  UKUT  00028  (IAC).  He  relies   in
         particular upon headnote (iv) which reads as follows:

             In appeals involving the proportionality  of  an  interference
             with a Convention right, the ultimate question for  the  Upper
             Tribunal is whether the  interference  is  proportionate,  per
             Huang v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2007] 2 AC
             167.

      4. Mr Butterworth submits, in essence, that a  high  level  of  weight
         should be placed upon the findings of the First-tier Tribunal  that
         it would be disproportionate to remove Mr [X]. The failure  of  the
         First-tier Tribunal to consider  s117A-D  Nationality,  Immigration
         and Asylum Act 2002 was, as provided for by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
         Martin, an error of law but although s117A-D should  be  considered
         this should be in the context of the findings  already  made;  such
         findings having been made after hearing evidence which  should  not
         lightly be disturbed. He submitted that the decision of the  First-
         tier Tribunal was the starting point but  acknowledges  that  s117B
         should be considered and reflected in the final decision. He relies
         upon paragraphs 24 - 27 in particular of Dasgupta.

      5. Mr Butterworth drew attention to  the  factors  considered  by  the
         First-tier Tribunal and which should be taken into account now  and
         decreased  the  weight  of  the  public  interest  in  removal.  In
         particular, he relied upon:

          i) Ms [B] and the children  are  lawfully  in  the  UK;  she  was
             initially granted DL here and the children's earlier grant  of
             DL has now been extended by the  SSHD.  It  is  not  simply  a
             matter of considering the circumstances  of  Mr  [X]  but  the
             whole family.

         ii) The length of residence of Mr [X] and his partner; he has been
             in the UK  for  11  years.  This  is  not  a  case  where  the
             individuals have arrived only in the last  few  months.  Again
             weight should be placed upon this.

        iii) In assessing the integration of Mr  [X]  (which  is  a  factor
             mirrored in s117B) the letters from friends are relevant; they
             have laid down root in the community and there is no  reliance
             by Mr [X] on public funds - he has  not  made  any  claim  for
             benefits. Both he and his wife work albeit Mr [X]  is  working
             unlawfully because he  lacks  the  appropriate  permission  to
             work. Such benefits as are claimed  by  Ms  [B]  are  for  the
             benefit of the children. Although Mr [X]'s  level  of  English
             does not satisfy s117B,  that  is  a  matter  that  is  to  be
             considered in the round.

         iv) Paragraph 28 of the  First-tier  Tribunal  decision[1]  is  an
             assessment that the First-tier Tribunal  was  well  placed  to
             make and weight should be placed upon those findings.

          v) Neither of the two children (the first born 27 September  2012
             and the second born 24 July 2014) are overstayers.  They  were
             both born in the UK. The longer the children remain in the  UK
             the greater their social and educational integration.  Neither
             of the children has ever lived abroad and it is in their  best
             interest that they remain in the UK.

         vi) There are no adverse suitability issues.

      6. Mr Butterworth submitted that the removal was  a  finally  balanced
         matter; the public interest was not met by removal of Mr [X].

      7. Ms Peterson submitted that the factual matrix in Dasgupta  was  far
         removed from that  of  Mr  [X].  Paragraph  26  of  Dasgupta  makes
         specific reference to Part 5A Nationality  Immigration  and  Asylum
         Act 2002 and to the specific duty of the Tribunal to  consider  the
         factors therein. Dasgupta specifically refers to the fact  that  it
         was not submitted that the public interest in s117B (2) or (3) were
         engaged and that the 'little weight' provisions did not apply.

      8. Ms Peterson drew particular attention to the precariousness  of  Mr
         [X] and Ms [B]'s status when their relationship commenced. Although
         Ms [B] now had limited leave to remain, his status had always  been
         precarious. He had arrived in the UK in 2006 and therefore had  not
         accrued 11 years' residence. He has never been lawfully in the  UK.
         She submitted that although there were supportive letters from  the
         community attesting to his value and integration, that did not make
         up for his lack of proficiency in English. Although Mr [X] has been
         working (without permission), and although the bank statements show
         in excess of �2000 going into the  account,  the  majority  of  the
         credits are benefits. The only credit not a  benefit  in  the  bank
         statements produced is a credit of  �4.00  on  26th  May  2015.  Ms
         Peterson submitted that the  bank  statements  do  not  evidence  a
         finding that Ms [B] can support Mr [X]  and  the  children  without
         recourse to public funds.

      9. In so far as the children are concerned, Ms Peterson submitted that
         the oldest child has just turned 4 and the youngest is  2.  Neither
         are qualifying children in terms of  s117B(vi)  and  there  was  no
         evidence that it was unreasonable for them to leave the UK. Mr  [X]
         has given evidence that his asylum claim was false and  he  had  no
         intention of pursuing it. Although Ms [B]  and  the  children  have
         been given further DL, whether  they  remain  in  the  UK  to  take
         advantage of that is a matter of choice for them. There was nothing
         to indicate that they could not return to China with Mr [X]  if  he
         chose to go there.

     10. Ms Peterson drew attention to the lack of inclusion of Mr [X] in Ms
         [B]'s application for further leave to remain in the  UK  and  that
         there had been no explanation for that. Mr Butterworth said that he
         "did not have instructions that permitted him to assist  the  court
         as to why Mr [X] was not a party to that application."

     11. Ms Peterson submitted that it was not disproportionate for  Mr  [X]
         to return to Germany for his asylum claim to be considered there.

    Conclusions

     12. The First-tier Tribunal judge reached conclusions without factoring
         into his assessment the specific elements of s117B. The conclusions
         reached by the judge on the proportionality of the  removal  of  Mr
         [X] to Germany failed  to  take  account  of  matters  that  he  is
         specifically required to consider in assessing whether  removal  is
         disproportionate. The specific finding  on  proportionality  cannot
         stand where there has been a failure to have adequate regard to the
         public  interest  in  maintaining  immigration  control.  The  mere
         recitation of the words does not substitute for an analysis of  all
         of the relevant factors.

     13. S117B does not restrict or reduce the scope of the  proportionality
         assessment to be undertaken to comply with Article 8.  It  reflects
         elements that form a part of that assessment  and  are  drawn  from
         Strasbourg jurisprudence. They are not exclusive and there will  be
         other matters of greater or lesser significance that  make  up  the
         assessment as a whole. Nor are they  matters  which,  if  not  met,
         inevitably result in an adverse finding. But they are matters  that
         have  to  be  considered  in   determining   whether   removal   is
         proportionate or not.

     14. Thus although the First-tier  Tribunal  judge  found  that  removal
         would be disproportionate, he did so without assessing the  factual
         matrix as a whole. That factual matrix includes the  considerations
         under s117B. So Mr Butterworth is correct to the  extent  that  the
         findings of the First-tier Tribunal judge are a starting point, but
         that starting point is only to  the  extent  that  the  judge  made
         findings on the factual matrix to be considered in  the  assessment
         of   proportionality.   The   finding   that   removal   would   be
         disproportionate cannot stand - it was made  without  consideration
         or assessment of the whole factual matrix.

     15. According to the  evidence  recorded  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal
         decision which has not been challenged, Mr  [X]  met  his  wife  in
         December 2011. At that time neither he nor she had leave to  remain
         in the UK. They were assisted by friend but found the  relationship
         difficult to continue and separated, but kept  in  touch.  In  2012
         when Ms [B] became pregnant, he worked cash in hand to support her.
         It was agreed that Ms [B] would take responsibility for the  child.
         She was given DL on 14th October 2013 on the grounds that  she  was
         the primary carer for her son  at  the  time  of  application.  The
         couple started living together in April 2014 and  were  married  on
         2nd June 2015.

     16. There was no submission before me that the couple now or have  ever
         met the  requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules.  There  was  no
         explanation why, despite the comments in  the  First-tier  Tribunal
         decision as to  an  expectation  that  Mr  [X]  would  apply  as  a
         dependant of Ms [B] in her application for further leave to remain,
         he was not included in that application, or if not permitted to  be
         included in that application whether he was referred to and in what
         manner.

     17. Although it seems that Mr [X] is now not  working  but  is  looking
         after the children to  enable  his  wife  to  work,  there  was  no
         evidence what her income was  or  how  many  hours  she  worked  or
         whether she had made enquiries as to whether other assistance would
         be available if Mr [X] were to leave the UK.  The basis upon  which
         Ms [B] obtained leave to remain was not before me.  It  seems  that
         she is a failed asylum seeker but it is unclear what  factors  were
         taken into account that led to her being granted either  her  first
         period of DL or the extended DL.

     18. Although Mr Butterworth's submissions appear to be predicated  upon
         Mr [X] and Ms [B] and the children living  together  it  is  by  no
         means clear that such a scenario is in fact the case - he  was  not
         included in her application for an extension  of  DL;  the  letters
         referring to the couple's relationship are not  recent;  there  was
         evidence before the First-tier Tribunal that  the  couple  had  not
         lived together whilst Ms [B]  was  pregnant  with  the  children  (
         possibly because of financial difficulties) and Ms [B]  appears  to
         be heavily reliant on public funds for her and the children's  day-
         to-day living expenses.

     19. Although the First-tier Tribunal found that there was a significant
         attachment between Mr [X] and the children there was no significant
         evidence before me of what the claimed adverse consequences of  his
         departure from the UK would be. If his claim for asylum in  Germany
         is rejected (or not pursued by him), he can expect to be removed to
         China after due process. There was no evidence before  me  on  what
         basis Ms [B] and the  children  could  not  also  return  to  China
         voluntarily if they wished to maintain their relationship.

     20. Mr [X] does not speak adequate English; his immigration status  was
         and remains precarious; he entered into his  relationship  with  Ms
         [B] at a time when both their status' were precarious;  he  remains
         unlawfully in the UK and has been unlawful since 2006. Although  Ms
         [B] now has DL her immigration status remains precarious.  The  two
         children are not qualifying children and have not been  in  the  UK
         for a significant number  of  years;  although  there  will  be  an
         attachment between  them  and  Mr  [X]  there  was  no  significant
         evidence as to what the consequences of his  departure  from  their
         life would be - particularly as it  may  not  be  for  long  if  he
         chooses not to pursue his asylum claim as he has said he would not.
         There is reliance on significant public  funds  and  no  indication
         that such reliance would not continue - Ms  [B]  has  not  provided
         evidence that she would be able to earn sufficient funds to support
         herself, the two children and Mr [X]  without  recourse  to  public
         funds. Although Mr [X] has been in the UK since April 2006, he made
         no attempt to  regularise  his  status  until  apprehended  on  9th
         December 2014. He did not admit,  until  presented  with  evidence,
         that he had previously claimed asylum in Germany.  He  admits  that
         his asylum claim has no foundation in truth. His relationship  with
         Ms [B] did not start until  2011  and  the  evidence  as  to  their
         cohabitation is sketchy.

     21. The factors set out in s117B are all answered in the negative in Mr
         Hue's case. There are no other significant matters that could begin
         to amount to matters that could tip the balance in his favour.  The
         most that can be said in his  favour  is  that  he  is  married  to
         someone with whom he has two children and they have DL.

     22. Taking all of these matters into consideration it is plain that  it
         is not disproportionate to remove Mr [X] to Germany  in  accordance
         with the decision taken by the SSHD.

    Decision

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law and was set aside.

    I re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing Mr [X]'s  appeal  on
    human rights grounds.

Upper Tribunal Judge Coker Date 17th October 2016

-----------------------
[1] "28. The Appellant's wife and children are here legitimately until
April 2016. They will have a right to make another application. Their
position and, inescapably, because he is a member of the family, the
Appellant's position will have to be considered then. No purpose would be
served by parting the Appellant from his wife and children. Equally, the
children looking at matters from their perspective, will not be assisted in
their general welfare and development by been [sic] deprived of the
presence of their father. The same could be said in relation to the
Appellant's wife. Separation of the family would be damaging to their
interest. Although the public have an interest and that interest must be
adequately factored in it is not demonstrated that the public interest is
served by removal of the Appellant in any respect be it economic, in the
interest of the maintenance of immigration control or otherwise. I have
concluded that proportionality falls on the family's side of the line. I
allow the appeal under Article 8 ECHR."
