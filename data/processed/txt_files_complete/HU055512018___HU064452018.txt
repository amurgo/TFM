                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The respondents  (hereafter  the  claimants)  are  citizens  of  India.
    Since the appeal of the second claimant turns entirely on that  of  the
    first claimant, I shall hereafter refer to the first  claimant.  Having
    arrived in the UK with a student  visa  in  August  2006  and  obtained
    subsequent extensions first as a student then under Tier 1 (Post-Study)
    Migrant and Tier 1 (General) Migrant, the claimant applied in time  for
    long residency in October 2016.  In a decision sent on 9 February  2018
    the appellant (hereafter the Secretary of State or  SSHD)  refused  his
    application.  The Secretary  of  State  applied  a  general  ground  of
    refusal, paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules, in relation to  the
    discrepancy between the claimant's declared income to HMRC in  2010  to
    2011 tax year and his Tier 1 (General) leave to remain application made
    in March 2011.  The SSHD states that in the tax questionnaire sent  him
    he had stated that he had discovered an invoice in November 2015  which
    had been missed when submitting his tax declaration of 2010 to 2011 and
    with the help of his accountant this was amended and paid subsequently.
     The SSHD considered that based on the original  earnings  declared  to
    HMRC he would have received 15 points for previous earnings  under  the
    Tier 1 Rules and so would have been 5  points  short  to  obtain  leave
    under his Tier 1 (General) application.  The SSHD stated  that  it  was
    acknowledged that paragraph 322(5) was not a mandatory refusal but that
    the  evidence  submitted  by  the  claimant  did   not   satisfactorily
    demonstrate that the failure to declare to HMRC at the  time  the  PAYE
    and self-employed earnings declared on his Tier  1  application  was  a
    genuine error.  It was noted that there would have been a clear benefit
    to him either by failing to declare his  full  earnings  to  HMRC  with
    respect to reducing his tax liability, or by falsely  representing  his
    earnings to UKVI to enable him to meet the points  required  to  obtain
    leave to remain  under  the  Tier  1  (General)  Migrant  scheme.   The
    appellant appealed.  His appeal came before Judge Oliver of the  First-
    tier Tribunal.  In a decision sent  on  7  January  2019  Judge  Oliver
    allowed the claimant's appeal on human rights grounds.

2.   The SSHD was successful in obtaining a grant of  permission  to  appeal
    and levelled four criticisms of the judge's decision.  It was contended
    that the judge had materially misdirected himself in law in:

    (1)  disregarding the fact that the claimant did not satisfy the Rules;

    (2)  wrongly portraying  the  claimant's  errors  as  confined  to  the
         inadequate information provided in relation to  his  2010-2011  tax
         affairs whereas there was also misconduct in relation to 2013;

    (3)  failing to address the delay  on  the  part  of  the  claimant  in
         seeking to resolve the discrepancies in his tax  returns  until  he
         was preparing for his ILR claim; and

    (4)    failing  to  make  findings  on  the  fact  that  the   claimant
         subsequently blamed his accountant for  errors  that  were  clearly
         his.

3.   I heard well-presented submissions from both representatives.

4.   As regards ground 1, the Secretary  of  State's  grounds  take  aim  at
    paragraph 12:

         "12. I start by observing that, but for the errors which have  been
             admitted, the appellant and his wife would appear to be  prime
             candidates  for  indefinite  stay  under   the   rules.    The
             respondent  has  made  a  clear  allegation   of   deceit   or
             dishonesty, a serious accusation,  and  it  is  therefore  the
             respondent's duty to establish the charge on  the  balance  of
             probability but with evidence of a strength commensurate  with
             the seriousness of the allegation (R (AN  &  another)  v  SSHD
             [2005] EWCA Civ  1605).   In  answer  to  the  allegation  the
             appellant has not only given a very detailed witness statement
             and  faced  cross-examination,  but  has  also   submitted   a
             corroborative statement from his accountant.   The  respondent
             has relied upon the reasons given at the time of refusal,  but
             has not at any stage considered the possibility  the  innocent
             explanation put forward, but has rather reversed the burden of
             proof".

    This was said to be a non-sequitur as the judge was simply stating that
    except for the period where the claimant did not satisfy the  Rules  he
    satisfied them.  I see no force in this submission taken  on  its  own.
    If the judge was right to  find  that  the  claimant  had  an  innocent
    explanation for the discrepancy in his tax affairs, then it was correct
    to say that he would not have met with refusal of his ILR application.

5.   As regards ground 2, it is correct to say  that  the  judge's  decision
    focused primarily on the error in relation to the 2010-2011 tax return.
     However, it is clear from paragraph 4 that the judge  was  aware  that
    the Secretary of State in the refusal decision had  alleged  a  further
    discrepancy  noted  in  his  Tier  1  application  on  4  April   2013.
    Nevertheless, it is incorrect of the respondent to refer to this  as  a
    discrepancy since his tax return for 2013 showed a turnover  of  �9,000
    which less expenses resulted in a net  profit  and  taxable  income  of
    �8,123.  On  the  Secretary  of  State's  own  reasoning,  this  figure
    corresponded with the amount he claimed to have earned between 1  March
    2012 and 28 February 2013 in his Tier  1  (General)  application  of  4
    April 2013.  What the Secretary of State appeared to query  was  rather
    the inconsistency in the turnover figures expressed for the years  2012
    on the one hand, and then  the  years  2014  and  2015  on  the  other.
    However, this was not further developed  in  the  Reasons  for  Refusal
    Letter nor, as far as one can tell, was it advanced by  the  Presenting
    Officer at the hearing before Judge Oliver.  In any event, it is  clear
    that the judge accepted the claimant's detailed explanation of his  tax
    affairs' history as set out in his witness statement.

6.   Turning to ground 3. I see no merit in the contention that  the  judge
    failed to address the issue of the delay on the part of the claimant in
    identifying the discrepancies in his tax returns.  Both in his  witness
    statement and in his oral evidence the claimant explained that  he  had
    no reason to know that an error had been made until closing  his  self-
    employment account in 2015 (see paragraph 8 of the  judge's  decision).
    Hence, applying the guidance set out in the case of  Khan  [2018]  UKUT
    384 (IAC), it  is  clear  that  the  judge  considered  the  claimant's
    explanation  for  the  delay  and  was  clearly  satisfied   that   the
    explanation given was an innocent one.  Given (as the judge noted) that
    the burden was on the Secretary of State to prove  the  misconduct,  it
    was  open  to  the  judge  to  find  that  the  satisfactory   innocent
    explanation sufficed to make paragraph 322(5) inapplicable.

7.   A similar point arises in relation to ground 4.  It is clear  that  the
    claimant sought to explain his error by reference to mistakes that were
    made at the time.  However,  it  is  not  correct  to  state  that  the
    claimant "blamed his accountant for errors that were clearly his".  The
    claimant's witness statement recognised that the primary error was  his
    own, stating at paragraph 13:

         "13. My accountant compiled my tax return for 2010-11 but there was
             formula error as to total turnover in income  summary  that  I
             printed and gave to him because when I added invoice of �5,150
             of March 2011 in my old income summary sheet inadvertently  it
             did not change total turnover  that  is  there  was  totalling
             mistake in the income  summary  I  prepared  and  gave  to  my
             accountant".

    But he went on in the same witness statement to claim  that  there  was
    some blame to be attached to  the  accountant.   At  paragraph  14  the
    claimant stated:

         "14. I can understand that it was  my  mistake  to  provide  income
             summary which had formula  error  but  I  do  expect  that  my
             accountant should not have relied on my income  summary  total
             and should have double checked my turnover total  and  had  he
             done that my initial tax return would have been  accurate.   I
             do understand that my accountant would not have expected  that
             I would have provided income summary sheet which  had  formula
             error as to total turnover".

    The judge did not err in referring to there being error on the part  of
    both parties.  At paragraph 8 the judge noted that in oral evidence the
    claimant had said  that  his  accountant  should  have  picked  up  the
    difference between the raw material in the false income summary he  had
    provided. It cannot be said to have  been  perverse  of  the  judge  to
    accept accountant error of this kind had happened.

8.   I am not entitled to interfere in the decision of a judge unless it  is
    flawed by a material error of law.  Whilst the decision  of  the  judge
    can be described as a generous one, it essentially based  itself  on  a
    careful examination of the evidence of the claimant, both  his  witness
    statement evidence and his oral evidence together with the  surrounding
    documentation. The judge was satisfied the  claimant  had  provided  an
    innocent explanation.  In so deciding he judge made no legal error.

9.   For the above reasons I conclude that the judge did not materially  err
    in law and accordingly  that  his  decision  to  allow  the  claimants'
    appeals must stand.

No anonymity direction is made.
