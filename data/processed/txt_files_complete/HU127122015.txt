Representation:
For the Appellant:      Mr I Chukwudolue of Moorehouse Solicitors
For the Respondent:     Ms J Isherwood, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

      1. The Secretary of State seeks  to  challenge  the  determination  of
         First-tier Tribunal Judge A W Khan allowing this appeal by way of a
         determination promulgated on 6 March 2017. For ease of reference  I
         shall refer to the parties as they were before the First-tier.



      2. The appellant is a national of Cameroon, born on 16 November  1981.
         His application for indefinite leave to remain on the basis of  ten
         years' residence was refused by the respondent on 23 November  2015
         because time spent here under the EEA  Regulations  did  not  count
         towards the period required under paragraph 276A of the Immigration
         Rules.



      3. The appellant entered the UK in June 2005 with leave as  a  student
         until 1 April 2007. What happened next is unclear. According to the
         determination, further leave was granted until 31 August  2010  but
         it would appear from the decision letter of 23 November  2015  that
         an application was rejected but that leave was subsequently granted
         until 31 August 2007, followed by a further period of  leave  until
         31 August 2008.  An  in-time  application  for  further  leave  was
         rejected on 15 January 2009  but  leave  was  subsequently  granted
         until 31 August 2010. There is then consensus  that  the  appellant
         obtained a residence permit on the basis of his marriage to an  EEA
         national, valid until 14 December 2015.  On 13  October  2015,  the
         appellant made a human rights application for leave  to  remain  on
         the basis of ten years' lawful residence. That was considered under
         paragraph 276B of the Immigration Rules and under the  respondent's
         Long Residence Modernised Guidance.



      4. The respondent considered whether the appellant's spouse had been a
         qualified person between 2010 and 2015 but found that there was  no
         evidence that she had.  Two  requests  for  additional  documentary
         evidence achieved nothing further from the appellant who maintained
         he was  not  in  contact  with  the  sponsor.  The  respondent  was
         unwilling to exercise her discretion under the guidance to consider
         the period under the EEA Regulations towards  the  ten-year  period
         required under the rules because of the lack  of  evidence  on  the
         sponsor's exercise  of  treaty  rights  and  the  application  was,
         accordingly, refused.



      5. When the matter came before the judge,  he  found  that  there  was
         evidence of the sponsor's employment, that she  had  also  been  in
         receipt of a maternity certificate, that she had spent a period  in
         hospital  with  a  severe  depressive  episode  and  that  she  had
         submitted evidence of  comprehensive  sickness  insurance  for  the
         whole  family  in  August  2014  when  she  had  stopped  receiving
         jobseeker's allowance. He found that  the  respondent  should  have
         exercised  her  discretion  in  the  appellant's  favour  and  that
         accordingly he had achieved ten  years  of  lawful  residence.   He
         allowed the appeal.



      6. The respondent sought and obtained permission to appeal from First-
         tier Tribunal Judge Frankish on 12 September 2017. The matter  then
         came before me on 23 November 2017.









      7. The Hearing



      8. The appellant was in attendance at the hearing before me  at  Field
         House but there was no oral evidence.



      9. I heard submissions from the parties. Ms Isherwood  submitted  that
         the judge had failed to  engage  with  the  issues  raised  in  the
         decision letter. She questioned how, on  the  evidence,  the  judge
         could have concluded that the sponsor was exercising treaty  rights
         when, for example, her P60 showed  an  income  of  just  ï¿½749.  She
         submitted that this was marginal or incidental employment at  best.
         She also queried the judge's reference to a  maternity  certificate
         having been issued in October 2012 but the child having  been  born
         in November 2013 (at paragraph 9). On the  issue  of  comprehensive
         sickness insurance, Ms Isherwood submitted that  the  evidence  did
         not demonstrate that there were ongoing payments  being  made.  She
         further submitted that it was not for the judge to  review  matters
         of the respondent's exercise  of  discretion.  She  criticized  the
         judge for failing to provide a chronology to show how the ten years
         had been calculated. She submitted that the determination could not
         stand and the matter should be remitted to the First-tier  Tribunal
         for a fresh hearing.



     10. Mr  Chukwudolue  responded.  He  submitted  that  the  respondent's
         challenge was just a disagreement with the judge's findings.  There
         was a chronology in paragraph 9 of the determination. The appellant
         had  spent  some  time  as  a  student  and  some  time  under  the
         Regulations. The sponsor had mental health  issues.  The  appellant
         had been responsible for the welfare of their child. Part time work
         was permitted. The sponsor had also been a jobseeker and that  made
         her a qualified person. The insurance payments were continuing. The
         judge found that cover had been paid for. The sponsor had access to
         the family funds even if she had no funds of her own.  The  finding
         on discretion was just a passing comment. If there were any  errors
         they were not material  as  the  appellant  could  not  be  removed
         because he was caring for an EEA national child.



     11. In reply, Ms Isherwood submitted that the judge  had  not  grappled
         with the issue of the child and so one could not speculate on  what
         decision would be made in that respect. If it was  the  appellant's
         submission that the sponsor did not have funds, that reinforced the
         respondent's case.



     12. That completed submissions. At the conclusion  of  the  hearing,  I
         reserved my determination.









     13. Conclusions



     14. I have taken full account of the submissions made and the  evidence
         before me. The appellant made his application under the Immigration
         Rules and cannot rely on any period spent under the Regulations  as
         part of the ten-year continuous residence period  relied  on  under
         276B because according to the definition of continuous residence at
         276A(b) it is existing leave to enter or remain. However, there  is
         guidance on this matter contained in the  respondent's  'modernised
         guidance on long residence', to which there  is  reference  in  the
         decision letter of 23 November 2015. The relevant portion states:


         Time spent in the UK does  not  count  as  lawful  residence  under
         paragraph 276A of the Immigration Rules for third country nationals
         who have spent time in the UK as:
         . the spouse, civil partner or other family member  of  a  European
         Union (EU) national
         . an EEA national exercising their treaty rights to live in the  UK
         but have not qualified for permanent residence
         . former family members who have retained a right of residence.
         During the time spent in the UK under the  provisions  of  the  EEA
         regulations,  the  individuals  are  not  subject  to   immigration
         control, and would not be required to have leave to enter or  leave
         to remain... However, you must  apply  discretion  and  count  time
         spent in the UK as lawful residence for an EU or  EEA  national  or
         their family members exercising their treaty rights  to  reside  in
         the UK. Sufficient evidence must be provided  to  demonstrate  that
         the applicant has been  exercising  treaty  rights  throughout  any
         period that they are seeking to rely on for the purposes of meeting
         the  long  residence  rules...  When  granting  a  Long   Residence
         application in which a person has relied on a period  of  leave  in
         the UK exercising treaty rights as an EEA national or their  family
         member, any grant of leave must be  made  outside  the  Immigration
         Rules  (Version 15.0: 3 April 2017, at page 24; added emphasis).



     15. The respondent had regard to this guidance when making her decision
         but as she found that the evidence did not show  that  the  sponsor
         had been exercising treaty rights  for  the  required  period  from
         August 2010, she did not exercise  discretion  in  the  appellant's
         favour.



     16. The judge erred when he concluded that the respondent  should  have
         exercised discretion in the appellant's favour. I cannot pass  this
         off as a "passing comment" as I was urged to do. It was  plainly  a
         finding which was instrumental to the outcome of  the  appeal.   As
         the appellant had withdrawn his appeal against  the  refusal  of  a
         permanent residence card and as this discretion witness statement a
         matter for the respondent outside the rules, it was not  reviewable
         by the judge.



     17. There are also problems with the judge's finding that  the  sponsor
         was a qualified person and in employment. As  pointed  out  by  the
         respondent, the sponsor's earnings are so modest as to be  minimal.
         The employment cannot  even  be  described  as  part-  time  as  Mr
         Chukwudolue submitted. Whilst there are no minimum number of  hours
         that an EEA national must be employed for in order to qualify,  the
         employment must be "genuine  and  effective  and  not  marginal  or
         supplementary" (The European Modernised Guidance,  7  April  2015).
         Although this was raised as an issue in  the  decision  letter,  Ms
         Isherwood is quite right to say  it  is  not  a  matter  the  judge
         grappled with or resolved.  Plainly  the  limited  income  did  not
         provide effective earnings for the support of the  family  and  was
         substantially below the Primary Earnings Threshold.



     18. There are also problems with the judge's finding on the  matter  of
         comprehensive sickness insurance. The judge  found  that  the  BUPA
         insurance had been paid for  but  he  gives  no  reasons  for  this
         finding and fails to point  to  the  evidence  which  led  to  this
         conclusion. Even if there was evidence of  a  single  payment,  the
         appellant is required to show  that  the  payments  have  continued
         throughout the required period.



     19. The judge is silent on the period when the sponsor  was  registered
         as a  jobseeker  (at  paragraph  9)  and  his  observation  that  a
         maternity certificate was issued in October 2012  does  not  accord
         with the date of birth for the child of November 2013  (ibid).  Nor
         is it clear how the appellant could have been receiving jobseeker's
         allowance at the same time as receiving a  maternity  grant  and/or
         being in hospital with mental health issues (also at paragraph  9).
         The judge also failed to deal with the period after  the  sponsor's
         release  from  hospital  and  the  termination  of   job   seekers'
         allowance.



     20. The judge's findings are all contained in a  single  paragraph  (9)
         and regrettably do not provide a  reasoned  conclusion.  They  read
         more as  statements  without  reference  to  specific  evidence  or
         reasons.



     21. It was argued for the appellant that even if there were  errors  of
         law in the decision, they were not material as  the  appellant  was
         caring for an EEA child. That may or may not be  the  case  but  as
         there was no evidence called on this issue, I cannot  speculate  on
         that. The judge made no findings on any family life issues.



     22. For these reasons, I find that the judge made  material  errors  of
         law and his decision cannot stand. The parties were agreed that  if
         such a decision were reached, then the matter should be remitted to
         the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  a  re-hearing.  The  matter   shall
         therefore be transferred to the First-tier  Tribunal  for  a  fresh
         decision to be made on all issues.






     23. Decision


     24. The First-tier Tribunal made errors of law such that  the  decision
         is set aside. It shall be re-made by another judge of that Tribunal
         at a date to be arranged.



     25. Anonymity



     26. No request for an anonymity order was made and I see no  reason  to
         make one.


    Signed
