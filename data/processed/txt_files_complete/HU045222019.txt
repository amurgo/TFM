Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr J Gajjar, Counsel, instructed on a direct access
                    basis
For the Respondent:    Mr D Clarke, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. This is an appeal against the decision of Judge of  the  First-tier
         Tribunal Nazir (the judge) who, in a  decision  promulgated  on  19
         July 2019, dismissed the appellant's human  rights  appeal  against
         the respondent's decision of 11 February 2019  refusing  his  human
         rights claim (in the form of an application for Indefinite Leave to
         Reman [ILR] based on the appellant's long residence).


      2. At the outset of the 'error of law' hearing the Presenting  Officer
         expressed his view that the determination contained an error  on  a
         point of law requiring it to be set aside and  that  it  should  be
         remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh hearing. There
         was no  objection  from  the  appellant's  representative  to  this
         position.  I agree with the respondent's position.


Background

      3. The appellant is an Indian national born  in  4  October  1983.  He
         entered the UK on 27 September  2006  with  entry  clearance  as  a
         student.  The  appellant  applied  for  further  leave  in  various
         categories and leave was granted, the  last  period  as  a  Tier  1
         migrant valid until 25 May 2016. On that date the appellant made an
         application for ILR as a Tier 1 General Migrant. This  was  refused
         on 31 October 2017. The refusal  was  apparently  received  by  the
         appellant on 10 November 2017. He did not request an Administrative
         Review. He made an application for ILR under paragraph 276B of  the
         immigration rules on 24 November 2017. I note  that,  according  to
         the immigration history detailed in the  decision  of  11  February
         2019, the appellant had been refused leave to remain as  a  Tier  1
         Migrant on 19 August 2010 and then made an out-of-time  application
         for leave to remain on 17 September 2010. This is different to  the
         timeline identified by the judge at [2],  where  the  appellant  is
         said to have been granted leave to remain as a Tier 1 Migrant until
         19 September 2010. The respondent considered that the appellant had
         achieved 10 continuous years residence in the UK. No issue  appears
         to have been raised  as  to  whether  the  appellant  has  in  fact
         achieved 10 years continuous  lawful  residence  in  light  of  the
         assertion that the appellant made  an  out-of-time  application  in
         September 2010. I merely flag this up for possible clarification by
         the First-tier Tribunal.


      4. The respondent refused the  application  for  ILR  under  paragraph
         322(5) of the immigration rules. This provision deals with  general
         grounds of refusal and falls under the heading  "Grounds  on  which
         leave to remain and variation of leave to enter or  remain  in  the
         United Kingdom should normally be refused."  It  is  not  therefore
         mandatory ground of refusal. Paragraph 322(5) reads,


             (5) the undesirability of permitting the person  concerned  to
             remain in the United Kingdom  in  the  light  of  his  conduct
             (including convictions which  do  not  fall  within  paragraph
             322(1C),  character  or  associations  or  the  fact  that  he
             represents a threat to national security

      5.  The  respondent  noted  that,  for  the  tax  year  2010/11,   the
         appellant's tax returns need to be amended to  show  a  net  profit
         from his self-employment of �32,179, as opposed  to  �6,233.  There
         was  a  difference  of  �25,946.  The   respondent   rejected   the
         appellant's  claim  that  a  temporary  member  of  staff  at   the
         accountant's  firm  altered  the  tax  return.  For  the  tax  year
         2012/2013 the appellant's net profit based on  his  self-employment
         had to be amended from �7,137 to �18,640. The  respondent  rejected
         the appellant's claim that the variation  stemmed  from  a  dispute
         with a client relating to a project and a provision  made  to  deal
         with this dispute in the tax  returns.  The  respondent  considered
         that the appellant had been dishonest in his dealings with HMRC  or
         the Home Office and that his application fell to be  refused  under
         paragraph 322(5).

      6. The appellant exercised his right  of  appeal  under  s.82  of  the
         Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. His appeal was  heard
         on 4 October 2019.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal

      7. The judge summarised the appellant's case and set out the  relevant
         legal framework. At [17] the judge indicated that he had considered
         all the evidence in the case, including the witness statements  and
         the oral evidence. Having satisfied himself that the respondent had
         discharged the initial evidential burden of showing  the  existence
         of prima facie evidence of  deception,  the  judge  considered  the
         explanation for the amended tax returns. At [20] the judge  stated,
         having considered the appellant's explanation,


             However, the reality was that these are not the  figures  that
             were submitted to the HMRC... The Appellant explains that this
             happened  as  a  result  of  a  'temp'  that  worked   at   DK
             Accountants, and relies on letters from the accountant and his
             oral evidence in support.


      8. At [24] the judge  considered  the  evidence  of  Mr  Kundi  of  DK
         Accountants  who,  consistent  with  his  own  statement  and   the
         appellant's evidence, maintained that he had submitted the  correct
         tax return but that a 'junior temp' member of staff had lodged  the
         incorrect figures with HMRC. The judge did  not  find  it  credible
         that Mr Kundi could not recall the name of this member of staff and
         did not find it plausible that a junior member of staff would  have
         gone to the HMRC system after the appellant's tax returns had  been
         submitted at 14.47 and significantly amended those figures  without
         the knowledge of the appellant or Mr Kundi [25]. The judge did  not
         find it plausible that the appellant would only have realised  more
         than a year after the tax returns were  submitted  that  there  had
         been an error. The  judge  did  not  find  it  plausible  that  the
         appellant would not have realised that his tax liability fell  from
         �7257.92 to zero.


      9. At [26] the judge dealt with the tax return for 2012/13. The  judge
         noted that, in respect of the  application  for  further  leave  to
         remain made on 25 April 2013, the appellant relied in some part  on
         income from a project with the Indian High Commission. In  his  tax
         return of January 2014 however a provision was created as a  result
         of which the income from the project was  reduced  because  of  the
         dispute. Whilst accepting that the appellant had done work for  the
         Indian High Commission,  the  judge  said  there  was  no  evidence
         relating to the claimed dispute.

     10. At [30] and [31] the judge satisfied himself, having regard to  all
         the evidence before him and his findings in respect of the  various
         discrepancies, that the respondent had proved  that  the  appellant
         had engaged in deliberate deception.

     11.  The  judge  then  went  on  to  consider  Article  8  outside  the
         immigration rules, noting that the appellant had resided in the  UK
         since September 2006, had established a business in  this  country,
         was well integrated and that his wife and children resided  in  the
         UK. They were however all Indian nationals who were  familiar  with
         the language and culture of India and the appellant was someone who
         would be able to obtain employment in India. Having regard  to  the
         appellant's dishonesty, the judge concluded that it  would  not  be
         disproportionate to refuse his human rights claim. The  appeal  was
         dismissed.

The challenge to the judge's decision

     12. The 1st ground of appeal contends that the  judge  failed  to  take
         into account evidence of a key witness, the  accountant  Mr  Naresh
         Jani of Andersons Europe. Mr Jani had prepared a witness  statement
         relating to the appellant's  tax  return  for  the  year  2012/2013
         confirming that the appellant  had  asked  him  how  to  deal  with
         disputed fees in his tax return arising from a dispute between  the
         appellant and the  Indian  High  Commission.  Mr  Jani  advise  the
         appellant to create the provision which would reduce his net profit
         by �11,503 in the self-assessment tax return filed in January 2014.
         Mr Jani gave oral evidence and his evidence was not  challenged  by
         the Presenting Officer, but this was not recorded by the judge  and
         there  was  no  assessment  of  Mr  Jani's  credibility.   As   the
         appellant's overall credibility was in issue, the  failure  by  the
         judge to engage with or  consider  the  evidence  relating  to  the
         2012/2013 tax returns affected the judge's  overall  assessment  of
         credibility.


     13. The 2nd ground of appeal contends that the  judge  failed  to  take
         material evidence into account, namely, the online  self-assessment
         dated 30 January 2012 filed at 14:47. The 3rd ground contends  that
         the judge failed to properly apply Balajigari [2019] EWCA  Civ  673
         in relation to the burden and standard of  proof.  The  4th  ground
         contends that the judge failed to take into account the  timing  of
         the appellant's amendment to his tax  return  to  the  year  ending
         2011. The 5th  ground  contends  that  the  judge  failed  to  take
         relevant  evidence  into  account  when  assessing  the  issue   of
         dishonesty as the target of  the  dishonesty  was  the  subject  of
         ambivalent findings. The 6th and 7th grounds of appeal contend that
         the judge failed to consider the discretion contained in  paragraph
         322 (5) when assessing whether it was undesirable for the appellant
         to remain in the UK in light of his positive contributions.

     14. In granting permission Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Scott-Baker
         noted that, according to the record of  proceedings,  Mr  Jani  had
         given evidence but that no reference was made in  the  decision  to
         this evidence. Permission was granted on all grounds.

     15. As I have already indicated, Mr Clarke accepted that the 1st ground
         had been made out and that this rendered  the  decision  unsafe.  I
         expressed my agreement with Mr Clarke's position and indicated that
         I was satisfied the decision contained an error on a point  of  law
         requiring it to be set aside.

Discussion

     16. It is not in dispute between the parties that Mr  Jani  prepared  a
         statement and gave oral evidence. Although the judge  indicated  at
         [17] that he had considered all the written and oral evidence,  and
         although it is not necessary for  a  judge  to  refer  to  all  the
         evidence relied on by the parties, it is nevertheless incumbent  on
         a judge to engage with relevant and material evidence and to make a
         finding in respect of that evidence, albeit that this can  be  done
         in brief terms. Mr Jani's evidence related to the establishment  of
         a provision  within  the  appellant's  tax  returns  for  the  year
         2012/2013. Although his  oral  evidence  was  brief,  it  was  also
         unchallenged by the respondent. Mr Jani's written and oral evidence
         was capable of  supporting  the  appellant's  explanation  for  the
         discrepancies in profits disclosed to the  Home  Office  and  those
         initially disclosed to HMRC. Whilst the judge was  not  obliged  to
         accept this evidence, the judge was obliged  to  engage  with  this
         evidence or to explain  why  evidence  capable  of  supporting  the
         appellant's explanation was not accepted. Given  that  the  judge's
         conclusions relating to the appellant's  honesty  was  based  on  a
         cumulative assessment of all the evidence before him, I agree  with
         both parties that, in respect of ground  1,  the  judge  materially
         erred in law.


     17. I am additionally satisfied that grounds 6 and 7 are made out.  The
         application of paragraph 322 (5) is discretionary  and  requires  a
         balance when determining, even if dishonesty has been proved,  that
         it is undesirable to grant leave (see Balajigari  [2019]  EWCA  Civ
         673, at [38]). Although many of the factors considered by the judge
         in his assessment of Article 8 outside the  Immigration  Rules  are
         relevant to the balancing exercise under  paragraph  322  (5),  the
         tests remain different and  factors  relevant  to  determining  the
         undesirability of the appellant remaining in the  UK  may  have  no
         part to play in the Article 8 assessment. It was incumbent  on  the
         judge to engage in the balancing exercise under paragraph  322  (5)
         and his failure to do so also constitutes an error of law.

     18. It is not necessary  for  me  to  comment  in  any  detail  on  the
         remaining grounds given that the  error  identified  in  the  first
         ground requires this  appeal  to  be  considered  afresh.  It  does
         however appear to  me  that  the  judge  gave  cogent  and  legally
         sustainable reasons at [21] and [22] for  finding  implausible  the
         appellant's failure to question why he initially paid  no  tax  for
         the tax year 2010/11 when, on his own account, he was aware that he
         had a tax liability of over �7000. Nor  am  I  persuaded  that  the
         judge failed to take into account material evidence when he stated,
         at [20], that the actual figures submitted to HMRC were �6,233.  It
         is apparent from the decision, read holistically,  that  the  judge
         was aware that the tax returns were initially submitted at 14.47 on
         30 January 2012 and that  it  was  the  appellant's  claim  that  a
         'junior temp' later amended  the  figures  (see  for  example,  [12
         (iii)] and [25]). Nor am I satisfied  that  the  judge  misdirected
         himself in respect of the burden and standard of proof.  The  judge
         was entitled to find that the  initial  discrepancies  between  the
         figures submitted to the Home Office and HMRC did establish a prima
         face case of dishonesty  that  required  an  explanation  from  the
         appellant.  This  is  entirely  consistent  with   the   principles
         established in Balajigari [2019] EWCA Civ 673.

     19. The errors of law that have been identified, particularly  the  1st
         ground, are however material and require a de novo hearing  on  all
         the issues.

Remittal to First-Tier Tribunal

     20. Under Part 3  paragraph  7.2(b)  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  Practice
         Statement of the 18 June 2018 the case may be remitted to the First-
         tier Tribunal if the Upper Tribunal is satisfied that:

         (a) the effect of the error has been to deprive a party before  the
            First-tier Tribunal of a fair hearing or other  opportunity  for
            that party's case to be put to and considered by the  First-tier
            Tribunal; or


         (b) the nature or extent of any  judicial  fact  finding  which  is
            necessary in order for the decision in the appeal to be  re-made
            is such that, having regard to the overriding objective in  rule
            2, it is  appropriate  to  remit  the  case  to  the  First-tier
            Tribunal.

 1. I have determined that the judge's conclusions relating to the issue of
    dishonesty are unsafe. The appeal will be remitted  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal so that a new fact-finding exercise can be undertaken.

Notice of Decision

The making of the First-tier Tribunal's  decision  involved  the  making  of
errors on points of law and is set aside.

The case is remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal to  be  decided  afresh
by a judge other than judge of the First-tier Tribunal Nazir.
