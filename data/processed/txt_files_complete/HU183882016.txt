Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr D Coleman, Counsel, instructed by Nandy & Co
For the Respondent:    Mr S Kotas, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. In a decision issued on 4 January 2018, I found an error of law in  the
    decision of First-tier Tribunal Beg which refused an appeal against the
    refusal of entry clearance as a spouse. The decision of the  First-tier
    Tribunal was set aside to be re-made at a hearing in the Upper Tribunal
    on 12 March 2018.

 2. At the hearing on 12 March 2018, the legal representative for the Entry
    Clearance Officer conceded that the  appellant  is  in  a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship with the sponsor and that for the  purposes  of
    the re-making of the  appeal  as  of  the  date  of  the  hearing,  the
    Immigration Rules  were  met.  In  those  circumstances,  it  was  also
    conceded that the appeal should be allowed.

Decision

 3. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal was set aside to be re-made.

 4. The appeal is re-made as allowed under Article 8 ECHR.
