                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr J Whitwell, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr S Karim of Counsel instructed by Kalam Solicitors



                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State, to whom I shall  refer  as
    such, against a decision by Judge Lingam  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    allowing an appeal by the appellant, Mr Ahmed, against  a  decision  by
    the Respondent dated 21 September 2015 refusing to vary  his  leave  to
    remain as the partner of Miss Shahanara Begum.

 2. The basis for the refusal  by  the  Secretary  of  State  is  that  the
    claimant, as I shall call Mr Ahmed, had relied on an invalid TOEIC that
    was fraudulently obtained to process the previous student  application,
    and thus his presence was not conducive to the public  good  under  the
    suitability requirements of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.

 3. Further reasons for refusal were given,  but  the  main  focus  of  the
    appeal before the judge was the issue of whether or  not  the  claimant
    had utilised a proxy test taker in  respect  of  his  English  language
    test.  The judge found in the claimant's favour, having heard  evidence
    and submissions on his behalf and on behalf of the Secretary  of  State
    who submitted copies of his English language  test  certificates  which
    were  dated  both  13  December  2011  and  17  January  2012,  an  ETS
    spreadsheet in respect of the test on 13 December 2011, a copy  of  his
    CAS, statements of Ms Rebecca Collings and Mr Peter  Millington  and  a
    report on Project Fa�ade, a criminal inquiry into abuse of the TOEIC at
    Westlink College, Essex, where the claimant had taken the  tests.   The
    judge concluded at [30] that the claimant showed a competent  level  of
    spoken English language, she  was  satisfied  that  he  gave  a  fluent
    account of how he had travelled to the college, and at [31]:-

         "With reference to the appellant's English language test results at
         pages 14 to 17, I am satisfied  on  his  explanation  that  he  had
         repeated the speaking part of his English  language  paper  because
         his score of 150 on the first attempt (13 December  2011)  was  not
         sufficient to meet the requirement of  level  B2  for  his  college
         needs.  I am satisfied he had a plausible explanation for  the  re-
         take.  I am satisfied that his second test result (taken in January
         2012 and, that which is not in dispute) showed  that  the  attained
         level B2 score for his purpose.  I am satisfied that the  appellant
         had declared both test results to process his application lodged on
         15 May 2012."

 4. The judge went on to find at [32]:-

         "... Indeed, I am satisfied the Respondent's position is  severally
         undermined for a lack of evidential force because she disputes with
         the appellant's score that he had  attained  on  13  December  2011
         rather than his second test result issued in January 2012.  To add,
         it is the appellant's evidence that  in  respect  of  his  language
         paper of 13 December 2011, he only relied on the  'writing'  aspect
         of the test result because the 'speaking' aspect of  the  test  was
         only sufficient to meet a level B1 standard.  Therefore, he decided
         to repeat only his 'speaking' part of his language ability  of  the
         second language test paper (see his test results at pages 14-17)."

 5. The judge concluded at [34]:-

         "It is on the Respondent's onus to prove  that  the  appellant  was
         guilty of fraud - Qadir [58] pointed out that it was  necessary  to
         ask if having regard  to  the  context,  the  Respondent's  adduced
         evidence is of sufficient cogency to warrant  the  conclusion  that
         the burden of proof has been discharged to the civil standard."

    The judge noted at [35] that the Tribunal in SM & Qadir (ETS - Evidence
    - Burden of Proof) [2016] UKUT 00229 (IAC).had found that  the  generic
    evidence relied on to date in all the ETS cases had  been  held  to  be
    insufficient to discharge the legal burden of proof on the Secretary of
    State  of  proving  that  the  TOEIC  certificates  were  procured   by
    dishonesty and at [35] the judge concluded:-

         "For the reasons stated in Qadir, I  am  satisfied  that  the  '...
         legal burden of proof falling on the Secretary  of  State  has  not
         been discharged'.  Indeed, the Respondent has relied on  the  wrong
         test paper to challenge the appellant's lack of credibility."

    At [37]:-

         "In so far as the core issues relating to my decision pertaining to
         the appellant's English language test result, I am  satisfied  that
         the Respondent's conclusion his present (sic) in  the  UK  was  not
         conducive to public good under para S LTR.1.6 of  the  Rules  lacks
         any evidential basis and therefore is not lawful."

    At [41]:-

         "In the instance appeal, I am satisfied  that  the  Respondent  has
         failed to adduce satisfactory evidence to  support  the  allegation
         against the appellant.  Additionally, no prosecution  investigation
         or proceeding was brought against the appellant."

 6. The judge therefore allowed the appeal to the limited extent  that  the
    Secretary of State must now make a lawful decision  with  reference  to
    Appendix FM and paragraph 276ADE(1) of the Immigration Rules  in  light
    of the decision in Greenwood (No. 2) (para 398 considered) [2015]  UKUT
    00629  (IAC)  under  the  third  power  of  disposal  of  the   appeal.
    Permission to appeal was sought by the Secretary of State in time on 30
    November 2016.  The grounds in  support  of  the  application  asserted
    that:-

      a) the First-tier Tribunal Judge had erred  in  failing  to  make  any
         findings in respect of information contained in the report from the
         Home Office Project Fa�ade Report on Westlink College, Essex; and

      b) that the judge failed to assess correctly the burden  of  proof  in
         line with the decision in SM and Qadir (ETS - Evidence - Burden  of
         Proof) [2016] UKUT 00229 (IAC).

    In essence it was submitted that the  judge  had  materially  erred  in
    misdirecting herself in law on this material matter.

 7. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Grimmett
    on 12 May 2017 on the basis that it was arguable that the  judge  erred
    in failing to note that the burden  shifted  to  the  claimant  if  the
    Respondent showed evidence of deception  following  SM  and  Qadir  (op
    cit).

     Hearing

 8. At the hearing before  me,  Mr  Whitwell  appeared  on  behalf  of  the
    Secretary of State and Mr Karim of Counsel on behalf of  the  claimant.
    Mr Whitwell sought to adopt the grounds of appeal, accepting  that  the
    grounds were relatively limited and asserted that the judge  failed  to
    make a finding on the evidential burden of proof as per SM and Qadir.

 9. He submitted that if the Secretary of State was correct, there had been
    a proxy test  taker  and  the  element  of  the  English  language  was
    disputed.  He submitted that the judge at  [13]  of  her  decision  had
    directed herself as to the legal burden and standard of proof, i.e. the
    standard of proof was a civil standard on the  balance  of  probability
    and there was no reference therein to the legal and  evidential  burden
    as set out in SM and Qadir.  He further submitted  that  there  was  no
    reference or findings in respect of the Home  Office  Operation  Fa�ade
    document which the judge mentions at [6] and [8] of the  decision.   He
    submitted that this, therefore,  was  not  factored  into  the  judge's
    consideration of whether or not a proxy test taker was  used  and  this
    does have an effect on the safety of her credibility findings  as  this
    was specific evidence in relation to the college in which the  claimant
    took the test, not just the generic evidence of Ms  Millington  and  Mr
    Collings and the spreadsheet in respect of the claimant's test taker.

10. Mr Karim in his submissions submitted that this was a  case  where  the
    Secretary of State's challenge has multiple frailties.  The claimant 's
    case was not premised on the fact that he  relied  on  the  certificate
    where the test scores were too low for him to attain a B2  result,  and
    it was illogical for him to have employed a proxy test taker who  would
    then fail that test.  He referred to  [29]  and  [31]  of  the  judge's
    decision.  Mr Karim stated that the claimant only re-took the  speaking
    part of the test on 17 January 2012 as he had passed the  writing  part
    of the test on 13 December 2011, scoring 190.  He  submitted  that  the
    evidential burden has nothing to do with the judge's findings  at  [32]
    and [35] of the decision.  The judge accepted  what  the  claimant  had
    said in his evidence and that there was no  challenge  to  the  judge's
    specific findings of fact in relation to the claimant's evidence.

11. Mr Karim drew my attention to the Court of Appeal decision in  Majumder
    and Qadir [2016] EWCA Civ 1167 at [18]:-

         "I have stated that the UT decided that the Secretary of State  had
         discharged the evidential burden that lay on the Secretary of State
         so there was a burden, again an evidential one, on Mr Majumder  and
         Mr Qadir of raising an innocent explanation. The  UT  accepted  (at
         [69]) the submission on behalf of the Secretary of State,  that  in
         considering  an  allegation  of  dishonesty  the  relevant  factors
         included the following: what the person accused had  to  gain  from
         being dishonest; what he had to  lose;  what  is  known  about  his
         character; the cultural environment in which he operated;  how  the
         individual accused of dishonesty performed under cross-examination,
         and whether the Tribunal's  assessment  of  that  person's  English
         language proficiency is commensurate with his or her TOEIC  scores;
         and whether his or her academic achievements are such that  it  was
         unnecessary or illogical for them to have  cheated.  There  was  no
         criticism in this court by Mr Kovats of that approach."

12. Mr Karim submitted that the  judge  clearly  found  at  [31]  that  the
    claimant had taken both tests  and  this  was  not  challenged  by  the
    Respondent in her grounds and there was therefore no material error  in
    the judge's decision.  Mr Karim further submitted that when at [35] the
    judge refers to the fact that the legal burden of proof  has  not  been
    discharged, this pre-supposes that she  accepted  that  the  evidential
    burden had been discharged by the Secretary of State which is  why  she
    then goes on to consider the claimant's evidence.  It is  a  three-step
    process.  The judge was clearly aware of the decision in SM  and  Qadir
    and had correctly applied the tests set out therein.  He submitted that
    this was a case that would fall within the third category of the  Court
    of Appeal judgment in Majumder and Qadir:-

         "The third category also consists of appeals by  the  Secretary  of
         State, but where the appeal is against the decision in which it was
         held that the generic  evidence  had  not  discharged  the  initial
         evidential burden and was thus erroneous in that respect, but  that
         other evidence meant that the Secretary of  State  would  not  have
         been able to discharge the legal burden. Mr Kovats  indicated  that
         in this class of  case,  also  without  giving  an  undertaking  in
         respect of any particular case, the Secretary of State  was  minded
         to concede and to abandon the appeal."

13. Mr Karim submitted that the judge relied on the fact  that  the  second
    test taken on 17 January 2012 was not challenged by  the  Secretary  of
    State and he concluded by submitting that even if there was an error in
    respect of their evidential burden, it was not a material error.

14. In relation to the Project Fa�ade Report, Mr Karim submitted  that  ETS
    cases are intrinsically fact-sensitive, that generic evidence does  not
    pinpoint an individual and has little value.  He submitted it was trite
    law that the judge does not have to refer to each  and  every  document
    before her, however the judge does note that it was before her  at  [6]
    and at [8] and crucially at [22] she states in terms that she had  paid
    attention to all the evidence relied on  by  the  Secretary  of  State,
    including the documents filed by the Presenting Officer which  included
    the Project Fa�ade Report.  He also drew my attention to paragraph [29]
    and the fact that the focus of the Secretary of State's submission  was
    that the claimant  had  failed  to  provide  a  reasonable  explanation
    against the allegation of using a proxy test taker,  however  this  was
    not accepted by the judge who went on to find  that  the  claimant  did
    take the test.  He submitted it was difficult to see that  a  different
    outcome would have been achieved by virtue of the judge making  express
    reference to the Secretary of State having  discharged  the  evidential
    burden of proof as per SM and Qadir.



     Decision and reasons

15. I found no material error of law in the decision of First-tier Tribunal
    Judge Lingam and I now give my reasons.

16. I accept the submissions of Mr Karim that it is clear from the  judge's
    decision that she clearly had in mind the decision in SM and Qadir (ETS
    - Evidence - Burden of Proof) [2016] UKUT 00229 (IAC) and she correctly
    applied the test set out therein which is,  in  essence,  a  three-part
    test.  Firstly, that the evidential  burden  is  on  the  Secretary  of
    State.  Initially, if that burden is discharged then the burden  shifts
    to  the  claimant  to  provide  an  innocent  explanation.    If   that
    explanation is accepted, the judge  then  has  to  go  on  to  consider
    whether the Secretary of State  has  discharged  the  legal  burden  of
    proving that there had been a proxy test taker.

17. In this case the judge cited extensively from the decision in Qadir  at
    [20] and [21] of her decision.  The judge then considered carefully the
    "generic" evidence of Rebecca Collings and  Peter  Millington  at  [23]
    through to [25].  She took account at [28] of the  evidence,  including
    the ETS SELT source data which purports to  show  that  the  claimant's
    test result sat on 13 December 2011 was invalid.

18. However, having heard evidence from the claimant the judge went  on  at
    [30] through to [33] that she accepted his evidence and the judge found
    at [32] that the Secretary of State's position was  undermined  because
    she had only taken issue with the first test score on 13 December  2011
    rather than the second test result in relation to January 2012.  I find
    that the judge correctly directed herself as to the burden and standard
    of proof and that is clear from [34] of her decision cited above.   The
    judge clearly found at [35] that the respondent had not discharged  the
    legal burden and there is no material error of law in her  decision  in
    this respect.

19. In relation to the second ground, I accept the submission of  Mr  Karim
    that permission to appeal was not expressly granted in relation to  the
    challenge to the judge's decision by virtue of an apparent  failure  to
    make any findings as to the information contained in  the  Home  Office
    Project Fa�ade  Report  concerning  Westlink  College.   The  grant  of
    permission to appeal is silent on that particular ground, but  for  the
    avoidance of doubt, having heard submissions from both parties  I  find
    no material error of law in this respect either.  It is clear that  the
    judge was aware of the document and its contents.  It  is  referred  to
    expressly at [6] where the judge records that  the  Presenting  Officer
    handed up the document entitled "Project Fa�ade - criminal inquiry into
    abuse of the TOEIC,  Westlink  College  Essex  Criminal  Investigations
    (Immigration)" recorded the fact that it was in the Respondent's bundle
    at [8], and at [22] made express reference to the  fact  she  had  paid
    attention to all the evidence, including that evidence relied on  filed
    at the  hearing  by  the  Presenting  Officer.   I  accept  Mr  Karim's
    submission that in any event this is also general evidence  as  to  the
    test taking at that college.  It does not identify the claimant and has
    no specific application to this particular claimant.



Notice of Decision

20. In light of the fact that there is no challenge  by  the  Secretary  of
    State to the judge's findings of fact, I find that those findings stand
    and the effect of my decision that there is no material error of law is
    that the judge's direction  at  [44]  that  the  claimant's  appeal  is
    allowed to the extent that the Respondent must make a  lawful  decision
    under Appendix FM and paragraph  276ADE(1)  of  the  Immigration  Rules
    should now be implemented.

21. I maintain the fee award that the First-tier Tribunal Judge made, given
    my decision to uphold her decision.

22. No anonymity direction is made.
