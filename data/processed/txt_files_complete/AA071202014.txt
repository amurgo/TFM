Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms Khan, instructed by Parker Rhodes Hickmotts
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Diwncyz, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant, [TT], was born on [ ] 1989 and  is  a  male  citizen  of
    China.  The appellant's application for  asylum  was  rejected  by  the
    respondent on 2 September 2014 and a decision made to remove  him  from
    the United Kingdom  by  way  of  directions.   The  appellant  appealed
    against that decision to the First-tier Tribunal (the late Judge Upson)
    which, in a decision promulgated on 12  December  2014,  dismissed  the
    appeal.  The appellant now  appeals,  with  permission,  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 2. Mr Diwncyz, for the respondent, accepted at the Tribunal hearing on  10
    February 2016 that the late Judge Upson had made a  material  error  of
    law and that his decision should be set aside.  I agree and my  reasons
    are therefore brief.  The First-tier Tribunal failed  to  deal  with  a
    material part of the evidence of  the  appellant.   The  appellant  had
    produced email correspondence between himself and a Ms [R],  who  lives
    in Australia.  In her written evidence, Ms [R]  claimed  that  she  had
    known the appellant since 2006 and his family since 2001 and  was  able
    to confirm his place  of  birth  and  also  corroborate  parts  of  the
    appellant's account, especially that he had been born in Tibet and  had
    an unlawful immigration status in India.  The Tribunal referred  to  Ms
    [R]'s evidence [20] but otherwise did not discuss  that  evidence  and,
    most significantly, made no findings in respect of the  reliability  of
    it.  Given that Ms [R]'s evidence was prima facie capable of supporting
    and corroborating the appellant's account, that omission amounts  to  a
    significant error of law such  that  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal falls to be set aside.

 3. There are other difficulties in the decision for  example  it  appeared
    that the Tribunal failed to apply the country guidance of SP and Others
    (Tibetan, Nepalese departure, illegal risk) People's Republic of  China
    CG [2007] UKAIT 00021 (IAC).  Notwithstanding the fact that  the  judge
    had found that the appellant is a Chinese of Tibetan ethnicity, he also
    concluded [40] the appellant had not left China unlawfully.

 4. In the circumstances, I set aside the First-tier Tribunal decision  and
    return the matter to the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  that  Tribunal  to
    remake the decision  following  a  further  fact-finding  hearing.   As
    regards the preparation for that hearing, I acknowledge that  it  would
    be helpful for there to be a Case  Management  Review  (CMR)  at  which
    arrangements may be made inter alia for the witness Ms [R] to be cross-
    examined from Australia by Skype or other electronic means.

Notice of Decision

The decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  which  was  promulgated  on  12
December 2014 is set aside.   The  appeal  is  returned  to  the  First-tier
Tribunal for that Tribunal to remake the decision.

No anonymity direction is made.
