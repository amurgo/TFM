Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Nazir Ahmed of Counsel instructed by H & V
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr A Sheikh, Home Office Presenting Officer

An individual who is the subject of  a  deportation  order  must  apply  for
revocation of the order before making an application for entry clearance  if
he/she is not to be subject to a mandatory refusal under  paragraph  320(2).
He/she is not able to raise revocation in the grounds of appeal and rely  on
s. 120 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002,  since,  whilst
s. 120 requires the Tribunal to consider all of the grounds  upon  which  an
appellant wishes to rely, it is not a mechanism which permits  an  appellant
to make an entirely new application to the Tribunal.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is the appellant's appeal  against  the  decision  of  Immigration
    Judge Broe made following a hearing at Birmingham on 9 August 2011.

Background

 2. The appellant, a citizen of Pakistan born on 1  November  1963,  has  a
    complex immigration history.  He married his former wife  Nahid  Akhtar
    on 18 March 1990 and on 17 April 1993 he  arrived  in  the  UK  as  her
    spouse.  There were two children of the marriage.  The appellant  lived
    with his former wife at the marital home but the  marriage  broke  down
    and he was unable to make an application for indefinite leave to remain
    within the probationary period since  his  wife  did  not  support  the
    application. He overstayed.

 3. On 7 October 1994 the respondent made a deportation order  against  him
    as an overstayer under s. 3(5)(a) of the  Immigration  Act  1971.   The
    appellant appealed and his appeal was dismissed following a hearing  on
    3  July  1995,  although  the  Immigration   Judge   recommended   that
    enforcement action against the appellant be deferred for six months  in
    order that he could clarify his position in relation  to  contact  with
    his children.

 4. On 30 January 1996 the respondent signed the deportation order  but  it
    could not be served because the appellant's whereabouts  were  unknown.
    He had moved to Scotland.

 5. The appellant's divorce was  made  absolute  on  19  May  1999  and  he
    subsequently met his fianc�e,  the  present  sponsor,  who  has  a  son
    Ishmail from her former marriage.    They had an Islamic marriage on  7
    April 2003 and a civil ceremony on 27 October 2003. The couple  have  a
    daughter together, Saba, born on 25 March 2004

 6. The appellant applied for leave to remain as a spouse but  was  refused
    on 17 November 2005.  He was refused on the  grounds  that  he  was  an
    overstayer, and his marriage did not predate the service of  notice  of
    liability to removal. His subsequent appeal was dismissed  following  a
    hearing on 13 February 2006.  The Immigration Judge stated that he  had
    been invited to revoke the deportation order and said  that  there  was
    nothing as matters presently stand which would justify its  revocation.
    Although it is not clear from the  determination  it  appears  that  it
    emerged during the hearing that the present sponsor  was  not  free  to
    enter into marriage with the appellant because  she  was  not  divorced
    from her former husband.

 7. The appellant voluntarily returned to Pakistan in September 2006 at his
    own cost.

 8. The appellant and sponsor lived together in Pakistan from 18 June  2007
    to 24 November 2008 and Ishmail came to live there with them during his
    school  holidays.   The  sponsor  and  the  appellant's  daughter  then
    returned to the UK in order to start pre-school nursery.

 9. On 16 July 2010 the appellant, advised  and  assisted  by  his  present
    solicitors, made an application for settlement in the UK as  a  fianc�,
    with the intention of entering into a civil ceremony with  the  sponsor
    on his arrival.  At that stage she had obtained her decree  nisi  which
    was subsequently made absolute.  The appellant disclosed the fact  that
    he had been deported from the UK, and indeed  his  immigration  history
    generally, in the application form.

10. The Entry Clearance Officer refused the application on the  3  November
    2010 under paragraph 320(2) because the appellant was currently subject
    to a deportation order signed on 30  January  1996.   In  view  of  his
    immigration history  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  also  refused  the
    application  under  paragraph  320(11).   Finally,  the  appellant  had
    provided no evidence of contact with  his  sponsor  since  a  visit  in
    November 2008 which in the Entry Clearance Officer's view cast  serious
    doubt as to the  true  nature  of  his  relationship  and  he  was  not
    satisfied that the  appellant  genuinely  intended  to  live  with  his
    sponsor as required by paragraph 281(iii) of HC 395.

11. The appellant appealed. In his grounds of appeal  he  stated  that  the
    application fell to be considered as an application for the  revocation
    of a deportation order and the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  should  have
    referred the matter to the Secretary of State for consideration of  the
    issue and had erred in failing to do so.  It was argued that there  had
    been a significant material change in circumstances which justified the
    revocation of the deportation order, namely,  in  the  absence  of  any
    criminal conviction or there being any risk to the public, the  signing
    of the deportation order was a disproportionate measure and contrary to
    law. There was no justification within the  decision  for  the  reasons
    behind the deportation order still remaining in force.  There had  been
    a passage of time and significant developments in case law  within  the
    context of Article 8 and the human rights of the family unit all needed
    to be taken into consideration.  The refusal under paragraph 320(2) was
    contrary to law and incompatible with Article 8.  With respect to human
    rights the Entry Clearance Officer had failed to give any consideration
    to s. 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and  Immigration  Act  2009  which
    imposes a duty to have regard to the need to safeguard and promote  the
    welfare/interests of children.

The Immigration Judge's decision

12. The Immigration Judge set out the evidence which he had heard  and  the
    submissions including an argument from the  appellant's  representative
    that the deportation order should be revoked.   With  respect  to  that
    issue the Immigration Judge wrote as follows:

         "I will deal firstly with the Respondent's decision under paragraph
         320(2) which provides that entry clearance is to be  refused  where
         the applicant is currently subject to a  deportation  order.   This
         Rule is expressed in a way which allows no discretion.

         There is no dispute that the Appellant is subject to a  deportation
         order.  Indeed it is part of his case that the Respondent erred  in
         not referring the matter to the Secretary of State for the order to
         be revoked.  He also asks for a finding that the  order  should  be
         revoked.  There is no evidence before me to show that he asked  for
         it to be revoked and the Respondent has not had an  opportunity  to
         make a decision on the issue.

         I am dealing with a decision to refuse to grant entry clearance not
         a decision to refuse to revoke  a  deportation  order.   I  am  not
         persuaded that  the  application  for  entry  clearance  should  be
         regarded as an application to revoke the order.  It is not  for  me
         to revoke the order or to make a finding that it should be  revoked
         until the  Respondent  has  had  an  opportunity  to  consider  the
         evidence and make a  reasoned  decision  under  the  provisions  of
         paragraph 390.  I have noted that the  judge  who  dealt  with  the
         Appellant's appeal against the  refusal  to  revoke  the  order  in
         November 2005 found that there was no basis for the  revocation  of
         the order.

         The issue before me is straightforward; at the time of the decision
         the Appellant was subject to a deportation order, paragraph  320(2)
         provides that an application is therefore  to  be  refused  and  it
         follows that the Respondent was right to do so."

13. The Immigration Judge then concluded that the respondent was  right  to
    refuse the application with respect to paragraph 320(11).  He  set  out
    the appellant's immigration history and wrote as follows

         "I am therefore satisfied  that  the  appellant  remained  in  this
         country knowing that a deportation order had been made and that his
         appeal had been dismissed. He managed to avoid the respondent until
         making his application in May 2004 over eight years after he should
         have left the country. He has not had valid leave to  remain  since
         the expiry of his initial leave to enter on 17  April  1994.  I  am
         therefore satisfied that he contrived to frustrate the  immigration
         rules.  I  find  that  the  Respondent  was  right  to  refuse  the
         application on these grounds."

14. He made no findings on whether  there  was  a  subsisting  relationship
    between the couple and no findings on paragraph 281(iii).  He  accepted
    that family life existed and that the sponsor was effectively a  single
    mother and shouldering the burden of earning a living and  raising  her
    children.  However he said  that  there  was  no  suggestion  that  the
    children were not thriving and family life was currently enjoyed by way
    of telephone contact with the appellant and there  was  no  reason  why
    that should not continue.  There was also no reason why the sponsor and
    children could not visit the appellant.  He saw  no  reason  to  depart
    from the findings made in  the  last  appeal  and  concluded  that  the
    decision to refuse entry clearance was proportionate  to  the  need  to
    maintain immigration control.

The Grounds of Application

15. The appellant sought  permission  to  appeal  on  the  grounds  in  the
    following terms. The  application  for  entry  clearance  made  by  the
    appellant fell to be considered  and  treated  as  an  application  for
    revocation of the deportation order alongside the application for entry
    clearance under the Immigration Rules and also under Article 8  of  the
    ECHR.  This was the point made by the appellant within the  Grounds  of
    Appeal.  There is  no  set  form  of  application  in  relation  to  an
    application for revocation of a deportation order  and  the  respondent
    was required to refer the matter to the Secretary of State for the Home
    Department to take a decision on  the  revocation  of  the  deportation
    order before taking a decision  under  paragraph  290  of  HC  395  and
    Article 8 of the ECHR.  The decision of the Entry Clearance Officer was
    therefore not in accordance with the law. The  subsequent  findings  of
    the Immigration Judge could not be sustainable  in  the  absence  of  a
    decision by the Secretary of State on the revocation of the deportation
    order.  Accordingly the correct approach for the Immigration  Judge  to
    take was to have allowed the appeal to the limited extent for the Entry
    Clearance Officer to remit the matter to the Secretary of State to take
    a decision on the revocation of the deportation order and for  a  fresh
    decision to be taken by the Entry Clearance Officer under paragraph 290
    of HC 395.

16. Permission to appeal was granted by Designated Immigration Judge Zucker
    for the reasons stated in the grounds.

Submissions

17. Mr Ahmed relied on his grounds. The application for entry clearance  as
    a  fianc�  included  an  implied  application  for  revocation  of  the
    deportation order since the appellant could not gain entry clearance to
    the UK as a fianc� unless  the  deportation  order  was  revoked.   The
    appellant had made known to the respondent in his application form that
    he was a person subject to  a  deportation  order  and  the  respondent
    should have considered the application as one for a revocation  of  the
    order alongside the application for entry clearance since the appellant
    could only secure entry clearance under the Immigration Rules following
    revocation of the deportation order.

18. The Notice of Appeal specifically contended that the application by the
    appellant should have been considered as an application for  revocation
    of the deportation order and invited the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  to
    rectify the error. The decision remains outstanding.   Furthermore  the
    appellant's instructing solicitors also wrote to the Secretary of State
    on 15 December 2010, after the refusal, requesting  that  consideration
    be given to the revocation of the deportation order but no response has
    been received. The Immigration Judge should have found that  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer's decision was not in accordance with the law.

19. Furthermore there was a common law duty of fairness in such  cases  for
    the Entry Clearance Officer to act fairly and  to  consider  the  issue
    relating to the revocation of the deportation order and to  afford  the
    appellant a reasonable opportunity to make further  representations  to
    be submitted before taking a decision on the application.

20. Mr Ahmed also sought permission to argue that the decision with respect
    to paragraph 320(11) was legally flawed, and that  the  respondent  had
    failed to discharge his duties under s. 55 of the 2009 Act in  relation
    to the children. He relied on ZH  (Tanzania)  [2011]  UKSC  4  and  the
    decision of the CJEU in Ruiz  Zambrano  (European  citizenship)  [2011]
    EUECJ Case C-34/09.  He submitted that the appellant  had  a  right  of
    residence under Community law and the deportation order was invalid.

21. Mr Sheikh submitted that there was no error of  law  in  the  decision.
    Both the Entry Clearance Officer and the Immigration Judge  had  looked
    at the application substantively. The appellant  had  made  a  previous
    application to revoke  the  deportation  order  whilst  in  the  United
    Kingdom and it therefore could not be said that he did not know how  to
    do it.  If an applicant who was overseas wanted to have  a  deportation
    order revoked the correct procedure was to make an application  to  the
    Entry Clearance Officer who would refer it to the Secretary  of  State,
    and the appellant had not done so.

22. The Immigration Judge was entitled to agree with  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer that refusal with respect to paragraph 320(11) was justified in
    view of the appellant's immigration history, and he had  also  properly
    considered all relevant matters with respect to Article 8 including the
    best interests of the children.

23. By way of reply Mr Ahmed submitted that there was nothing in the  Rules
    which  required  an  applicant  to  make  a  separate  application  for
    revocation which should be taken to be implied in the application which
    was made and in respect of the claim under Article 8.  He  also  relied
    on  the  Tribunal's  decision  in  SZ  (Applicable  Immigration  Rules)
    Bangladesh [2007] UKAIT 00037 which  held  that  whilst  there  was  no
    general duty on the Tribunal to  consider  whether  a  claimant's  case
    might have succeeded on a  different  basis  from  that  on  which  the
    application was made, exceptionally the terms of a notice  of  decision
    may require the  Tribunal  to  consider  the  appeal  on  a  number  of
    alternative bases.

Paragraph 320(2)

24. Under paragraph 390 of HC  395  an  application  for  revocation  of  a
    deportation order will be  considered  in  the  light  of  all  of  the
    circumstances including -

    (i)    the grounds on which the order was made;

    (ii)   any representations made in support of revocation;

    (iii)  the interests of the community, including the maintenance of  an
         effective immigration control;

    (iv)   the interests of  the  applicant,  including  any  compassionate
         circumstances.

25. Under paragraph 391 in the case of any applicant who has been  deported
    following a criminal offence, continued exclusion will normally be  the
    proper course.  In  other  cases  revocation  of  the  order  will  not
    normally  be  authorised  unless  the  situation  has  been  materially
    altered, either by a change of circumstances since the order was  made,
    or by fresh information coming  to  light  which  was  not  before  the
    appellate authorities or the Secretary of State. The  passage  of  time
    since the person was deported may also  in  itself  amount  to  such  a
    change of circumstances as to warrant revocation of the order.

26. Paragraph 392 makes it clear that revocation  of  a  deportation  order
    does not entitle the person concerned to re-enter the  UK;  it  renders
    him eligible to apply for admission under the  Immigration  Rules.   An
    application for revocation of the  order  may  be  made  to  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer or direct to the Home Office.

27. The IDIs relating to the revocation of deportation  orders  also  state
    that applications may be made at any time either directly to  the  Home
    Office or through a post overseas by a deportee or his  representative.
    Once a person has been deported he or she must successfully  apply  for
    the deportation order to be revoked before applying for entry clearance
    in order to lawfully return to the UK.

28. This is therefore not a case which is analogous to that in SZ in  which
    the Tribunal recognised that there could be situations where  there  is
    an obvious link  or  connection  between  one  Rule  and  another,  and
    therefore that will mean that there is an obligation on the Tribunal to
    consider and apply another Rule if fairness requires it to do so.   The
    appellant did not fail to apply under the correct Rule.  He  wished  to
    come to the UK to join his sponsor, but he had not contracted  a  valid
    marriage with her since at the time of the religious ceremony  she  was
    not free to marry. Accordingly he could only apply for entry  clearance
    as a fianc�. There was no other relevant Rule applicable to him.

29. The problem for the appellant was  that  he  made  an  application  for
    settlement which was bound to fail because he was still the subject  of
    a deportation order, and therefore the subject of a mandatory  refusal.
    Paragraph 390 contemplates that representations will need to be made in
    order to support an application for revocation. Paragraph 392 makes  it
    clear that it is a two stage process. Had  he  or  his  representatives
    checked either the Immigration Rules or the IDIs  it  would  have  been
    abundantly clear that it was necessary for the appellant  to  apply  to
    have the deportation order revoked before he would be able  to  succeed
    in a fianc� application.

30. It must be remembered that the appellant  is  the  author  of  his  own
    misfortune.  It was his conduct which led to his deportation.  That  is
    no doubt the reason why there is a two stage procedure for persons  who
    are subject to a deportation order. The purpose behind making a  person
    who is subject to a deportation order apply for revocation is  so  that
    proper consideration can be given to an individual's  circumstances  as
    set out in paragraph 390 of HC 395, i.e. whether it is right in all the
    circumstances for the deportation order to be  revoked,  prior  to  any
    application for entry  clearance.   If  Mr  Ahmed's  argument  were  to
    succeed it would mean that any person who is subject to  a  deportation
    order would be in no different a position from any other person seeking
    entry clearance.

31. Whilst Mr Sheikh submitted that the appellant had  previously  made  an
    application for revocation that does not appear to be right.  It  seems
    to have been raised by the representatives at the  hearing  before  the
    Immigration Judge in 2006, in an attempt, as now, to raise the question
    of revocation at a late stage in the proceedings. However Mr  Ahmed  is
    simply wrong to state that there was nothing in the Rules and procedure
    which requires a person  to  apply  for  revocation  separately  to  an
    application for entry clearance.  Whether or not there  is  a  specific
    form, the Rules and the IDIs are entirely clear.

32. In his skeleton argument Mr Ahmed states that there was nothing  before
    the Immigration Judge to suggest that the Entry Clearance  Officer  had
    raised any specific objection to the issues  raised  in  the  case,  by
    which I take it to mean the revocation of the deportation order.   That
    is not surprising because no application had ever been made.

33. He also  argues  that  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  failed  to  give
    consideration or take any action in relation to the revocation  of  the
    deportation order and a decision on this aspect of  his  claim  remains
    outstanding.  It does not because he never made any application.

34. The Entry Clearance Officer made the only decision which  was  open  to
    him. It was clearly lawful.

35. It is also, in effect, although not cited by him, Mr  Ahmed's  argument
    that s. 120 requires the Immigration Judge to look at the merits of the
    application for revocation  of  the  deportation  order  since  it  was
    pleaded in the Grounds of Appeal, and therefore that his  decision  was
    unlawful.

36.  Under s. 120 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  the
    appellant may be required to state -

    (a)    his reasons for wishing to enter or remain in the UK.

    (b)    any grounds on which he should be permitted to enter  or  remain
         in the UK, and

    (c)    any grounds on which he should not be removed from  or  required
         to leave the UK.

37. In the Grounds, inter alia, the appellant stated that  the  application
    fell to  be  considered  as  an  application  for  a  revocation  of  a
    deportation order.

38. Under s. 85(2) of the Nationality, Asylum and Immigration Act 2002,  if
    an appellant under s. 82(1) makes a statement under s. 120 the Tribunal
    shall consider any matter raised in the statement which  constitutes  a
    ground of appeal of a kind listed in  s.  84(1)  against  the  decision
    appealed against.

39. Under s. 85(3), subsection (2) applies to a statement made under s. 120
    whether the statement was made before or after the appeal commenced.

40. Under s. 85(4) on an appeal under s. 82(1) [83(2) or 83A(2)] against  a
    decision the Tribunal may consider evidence about any matter  which  it
    thinks relevant to the substance of the  decision,  including  evidence
    which concerns a matter arising after the date of decision.

41. However subsection  (4)  is  subject  to  the  exceptions  in  s.  85A.
    Exception 1 is that in relation to an appeal under s. 82(1) against  an
    immigration decision of a kind specified in  s.  82(2)(b)  or  (c)  the
    Tribunal may consider only the circumstances  appertaining at the  time
    of the decision.

42. An application for entry clearance is an immigration decision of a kind
    specified in s.  82(2)(b).

43. The first point to make is that the requirement in s. 85(2) to consider
    any matter raised in a s. 120 notice is restricted to  grounds  against
    the decision appealed against. The decision appealed  against  was  the
    refusal to grant entry clearance as a fianc�,  and  the  appellant  was
    refused, inter alia, on the grounds  that  he  was  the  subject  of  a
    mandatory refusal under paragraph 320(2).  The grounds did not  address
    that issue by, for example arguing that the appellant was  not  subject
    to a deportation order. Instead they sought,  within  the  grounds,  to
    make a new application which had never been made to the Entry Clearance
    Officer.

44.  In AS (Afghanistan) [2009]  EWCA  Civ  1076,  Moore-Bick  LJ  held  at
    paragraph 79  that there is a duty on  the  Tribunal  to  consider  any
    matter raised in a s. 120 statement:

         "insofar as it constitutes a ground of appeal of  a  relevant  kind
         against the decision under appeal. Thus far  it  seems  to  me  the
         natural meaning of these provisions is to impose on the Tribunal  a
         duty to consider matters raised by the Appellant  insofar  as  they
         provide grounds for challenging a substantive decision  of  a  kind
         identified in section 82 that affects his immigration status."

45. Thus whilst AS (Afghanistan) requires the Tribunal to consider  all  of
    the grounds upon which an appellant seeks to rely  in  challenging  the
    decision of the Entry Clearance Officer or the Secretary of  State,  it
    is not authority for the  proposition  that  the  issues  raised  in  a
    statement under s. 120 are to be treated as a fresh application to  the
    Tribunal. The issues raised are to  be  treated  as  an  additional  or
    expanded ground of appeal against the decision which has been made.  It
    is not a mechanism which permits an appellant to make an  entirely  new
    application to the Tribunal.

46. Further, in this particular case, to allow the  appellant  to  raise  a
    fresh application in his grounds would negate the  purpose  of  s.  85A
    which restricts the Tribunal's considerations in entry clearance  cases
    to  circumstances  appertaining  at  the  time  of  the  decision,  and
    therefore neither the fact that the appellant's solicitors wrote to the
    respondent after the refusal seeking revocation of the order,  nor  the
    fact that revocation was raised in the Grounds of Appeal can assist him
    because they were not circumstances appertaining at  the  date  of  the
    decision - at the date of the decision the appellant was the subject of
    a deportation order.

47. To hold otherwise would be to circumvent the procedure which  has  been
    set down in the Immigration Rules namely that unless there has  been  a
    successful application for  revocation  of  a  deportation  order,  any
    application will be subject to a mandatory refusal.

48. With respect to the  argument  that  the  appellant  has  been  treated
    unfairly, the Entry Clearance Officer was  faced  with  an  application
    which attracted a  mandatory  refusal.   The  appellant  had  not  been
    deprived of any opportunity to argue his  case.   He  had  not  applied
    under the wrong Rule.  He had  made  an  application  which  could  not
    succeed.  There was no obligation on him to advise the  appellant  that
    he needed to make an application for a revocation  of  the  deportation
    order before applying for settlement or to defer making a  decision  in
    order to allow him to make further representations. It is not the  duty
    of an Entry Clearance Officer to advise the appellant but the  duty  of
    his representatives.  The requirements for  entry  clearance  are  made
    public and plainly set out in the Immigration Rules and the  IDIs.   It
    cannot be said that there is anything intrinsically unfair in an  Entry
    Clearance Officer refusing an application which was bound to fail.

49. The cases in which it has been held that a  decision  maker  has  acted
    unfairly have been in limited circumstances, where, for example, in the
    case of Patel (revocation of Sponsor's licence - fairness) India [2011]
    UKUT 211 (IAC) a student has been deprived of an  opportunity  to  meet
    the case against him, or most recently  Naved  (student  -  fairness  -
    notice of points) Pakistan [2012] UKUT 14 (IAC).  But there is no  such
    deprivation of an opportunity  here.   The  Rules  are  clear  and  the
    Appellant has not abided by them.

50. In conclusion, the Immigration Judge did not act unlawfully in  stating
    that he was not persuaded that  the  application  for  entry  clearance
    should be regarded as an application to revoke  the  deportation  order
    since the appellant is not permitted by virtue of s.  120  to  raise  a
    fresh application in the grounds of appeal.

 Paragraph 320(11)

51. Although not specifically pleaded in the  grounds  Mr  Ahmed  submitted
    that the decision with respect to paragraph 320(11) was not sustainable
    and that the refusal under paragraph 320(11) fell to  be  construed  in
    line with  the  exceptional  provisions  under  paragraph  320(7C)  and
    accordingly the decision was legally flawed.

52. Paragraph  320(7C)  specifically  refers  to  paragraph  320(7B)  which
    requires mandatory refusal in certain circumstances.  However,  it  was
    the clear intention of the Rules in  paragraph  320(11)  to  provide  a
    discretionary ground for refusal in circumstances such as  these  where
    an appellant,  who  would  otherwise  not  be  caught  by  the  refusal
    provisions in paragraph 320(7B) because he  is  seeking  entry  on  the
    basis of marriage,  or  prospective  marriage,  has  overstayed  for  a
    considerable period of time, in this case over eight years.

53. Moreover whilst in PS (paragraph 320(11) discretion: care needed) India
    [2010] UKUT 440 (IAC) the Tribunal held that the  decision  maker  must
    exercise great care in assessing the aggravating circumstances said  to
    justify refusal in cases where the automatic prohibition on  the  grant
    of entry clearance in paragraph 320(7B)  is  dis-applied  by  paragraph
    320(7C), the Tribunal did not say that paragraph 320(11) cannot ever be
    justified.

54. However it is right to say that  there  was  no  consideration  by  the
    Immigration Judge of the fact that the appellant had made  a  voluntary
    departure to Pakistan, nor that the family had lived there together for
    a considerable period of  time  before  making  the  application  under
    appeal. Indeed the sponsor and her daughter  have  made  a  significant
    effort to relocate and live as a family  unit  with  the  appellant  in
    Pakistan. Moreover the sponsor has a child from a former marriage  whom
    she cannot be expected to leave in the UK. The evidence was that he was
    only able to join her in  Pakistan  during  the  school  holidays.  The
    Immigration Judge's considerations are not a fair reflection  of  these
    facts and  whilst  it  is  undoubtedly  true  that  there  was  a  very
    significant period of time when the Appellant was an absconder  and  he
    had not had valid leave to remain in the  UK  since  1995,  it  is  not
    apparent from the relatively  brief  treatment  of  the  issue  in  the
    determination that the Immigration Judge had in mind the guidance in PS
    that great care was required to properly assess  all  of  the  relevant
    factors.

Paragraph 281(iii)

55. The Immigration Judge made no findings at all with respect to paragraph
    281(iii) which was one of the issues  raised  by  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer and which it was therefore incumbent upon him to decide. Not to
    do so is a clear error. In fact there is strong evidence that this is a
    subsisting relationship. The couple have been together for a number  of
    years. They have a daughter. There has  been  significant  cohabitation
    both in the UK and Pakistan. The sponsor has supported the  application
    throughout the appeal process.

56. The errors in the determination with respect to paragraphs 320(11)  and
    281(iii) are however immaterial because the  appellant  cannot  succeed
    under paragraph 320(2).

Article 8

57. With respect to Article 8, this again was not a matter pleaded  in  the
    original grounds but sought to be raised by Mr Ahmed at the hearing.

58. The brief conclusion that family life could continue by way  of  visits
    and telephone contact is not  consistent  with  the  holistic  view  of
    family life as developed over recent case law. Furthermore,  the  judge
    did not cite s. 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009
    which applies to the daughter in the UK and his comment that there  was
    no suggestion that the children were not  thriving,  is  not  a  proper
    reflection of his duty to consider the best interests of the child.

59. Accordingly the decision with respect to Article 8 must be re-made.

60. There is family life between  the  appellant,  the  sponsor  and  their
    daughter. The evidence of a subsisting relationship over many years  is
    strong, and the couple have undergone  an  Islamic  marriage  ceremony.
    They intend to marry in the UK shortly after  the  appellant's  arrival
    here.

61. The decision to refuse entry clearance is  an  interference  with  that
    right. Family life cannot reasonably be conducted via telephone  calls,
    emails and the occasional visit.

62. The decision is lawful and necessary in pursuit of the  legitimate  aim
    of the economic well being  of  the  country  via  the  maintenance  of
    immigration control.

63. There are strong arguments in the appellant's favour. His  relationship
    cannot easily be conducted  in  Pakistan  because  the  sponsor  has  a
    relatively young son who, on past experience is not able to  live  with
    her there. Subject to the maintenance and  accommodation  requirements,
    it is likely that he would have a good case for entry  under  paragraph
    281. Furthermore, there has been a considerable period of time since he
    made his voluntary departure from the UK.

64. However,  crucially,  the  appellant  has  a  remedy  for  his  present
    difficulties under the Immigration Rules. He  simply  has  to  make  an
    application under paragraphs 391 and 392 for revocation,  and  then  to
    apply as a fianc�. Where there is a clear procedure to be followed, and
    an appellant has chosen not to follow it, it is very hard  to  envisage
    circumstances  in  which  it  would  be  proportionate  to  allow   the
    Immigration Rules to be circumvented by relying on Article 8.

65. Finally, again, as an additional  ground,  Mr  Ahmed  stated  that  the
    appellant had a right of residence under community law given the ruling
    in Zambrano.  It is unclear what is meant by this submission.  Zambrano
    was concerned with the effect of depriving  citizens  of  the  European
    Union of the genuine enjoyment of the substance of the rights conferred
    by virtue of their status as  citizens  of  the  Union  and  held  that
    Article 20 TFEU is to be interpreted as meaning  that  it  precludes  a
    member state from refusing a third country national upon whom his minor
    children, who are European Union citizens are  dependent,  a  right  of
    residence in the Member State of residence  and  nationality  of  those
    children, and from refusing to  grant  a  work  permit  to  that  third
    country national insofar as such decisions deprive  those  children  of
    the genuine enjoyment of the substance of the rights  attached  to  the
    status of European Union citizens.  There has been no such  deprivation
    here.  The children continue to live  with  their  mother  in  the  UK.
    Zambrano is not authority for the proposition that it is  impermissible
    to deport any third country  national  who  has  a  British  citizen/EU
    citizen child.

Decisions

66. The appellant's appeal against the decision  to  refuse  to  grant  him
    entry clearance under paragraph 320(2) is dismissed.

67. The Immigration Judge erred in law in  respect  of  his  considerations
    under paragraph 320(11) but the error is immaterial given the above.

68. Similarly the Immigration Judge  erred  in  not  considering  paragraph
    281(iii) but again, the error is not material.

69. The Immigration Judge's decision under Article 8 has been set aside and
    re-made, again dismissing his appeal.
