For the Respondent:    Mr Avery


                            DECISION AND REASONS
         Background


 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Ghana  born  in  1968.   Her  immigration
    history is that she entered the UK on a visit visa in April 2010  which
    was later extended to 30 September 2010.  She has overstayed since.  On
    23 January 2015 she made an application for  leave  to  remain  on  the
    basis of her relationship with a British citizen, Mr Albert Addo.   The
    application was refused on 19 June 2015.  It was stated that she  could
    not satisfy the requirements in paragraph EX.1. of Appendix FM  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

 2. She appealed.

 3. Following a hearing at Harmondsworth on 19 May 2016 Judge of the First-
    tier M B Hussain dismissed the appeal under the  Rules.   He  found  no
    reason to consider the claim on human rights grounds outside the Rules.



 4. He heard oral evidence from the Appellant, Mr Addo and the  Appellant's
    adult daughter.  His findings are at paragraph [9ff].   Following  what
    both representatives before me agreed was an unnecessary  consideration
    of whether the marriage was genuine  and  subsisting,  there  being  no
    issue on that matter, the judge's brief  analysis  is  at  [15ff].   He
    noted that the Appellant was unlawfully in the UK [15].

 5. The only other analysis is at [16, 17] where he wrote:

         '16. Under paragraph EX.1 the appellant  has  to  demonstrate  that
             there are insurmountable obstacles to him and his wife/partner
             enjoying  family  life  elsewhere  than  the  United  Kingdom.
             Paragraph  EX.2.  defines  what   constitutes   insurmountable
             obstacles.  In this  regard,  the  only  evidence  before  the
             Tribunal was  set  out  in  paragraph  5  of  the  appellant's
             husband's statement which stated

                  "I am unable to relocate to  Ghana  because  I  have  been
                  living in the UK for over twenty four years and am in full
                  time employment.  I do not have any relatives in Ghana and
                  all my life has been spent in the UK.  I came to the UK at
                  the age of 31 years and have  spent  the  majority  of  my
                  adult life in the UK".

         17.  The points in the passage quoted above did not  point  to  any
             significant obstacle in my  view  preventing  the  appellant's
             husband from returning to his home  country  to  enjoy  family
             life with the Appellant.

         18.  I  find  therefore  that  the  appellant  does  not  meet  the
             requirements in paragraph EX.1'.

 6. She sought permission to appeal which was refused on 17 November  2016.
    However, on reapplication permission was granted on 22 February 2017, a
    judge stating:

         '...

         2.   As noted in the  Grounds  of  Appeal,  the  Sponsor's  witness
             statement sets out that he has two children  from  a  previous
             relationship that he supported  emotionally  and  financially.
             In principle a relationship of that  nature,  if  accepted  as
             amounting to a genuine relationship of real  substance,  might
             be relevant: arguably  to  the  assessment  of  insurmountable
             obstacles and without doubt to  the  need  to  strike  a  fair
             balance between the public interest in  enforcing  immigration
             control in the light of private and family life connections to
             the UK ...'.

          Error of law hearing

 7. At the error of law hearing before me Ms Record did not seek  to  argue
    that the Appellant met the Rules.  However,  in  failing  to  consider,
    indeed, make any reference at all to the  husband's  children,  one  of
    whom is a minor and with both of whom he has a close relationship,  the
    judge materially erred.  Such an  issue  should  have  been  considered
    under Article 8 outside the Rules.

 8. The judge also erred in failing to give consideration  to  whether  the
    Appellant should have to return to apply for entry clearance.

 9. Mr Avery's response was to question what evidence was  advanced  before
    the First-tier as to the existence  and  substance  of  a  family  life
    between the Appellant and her husband's family and between the  husband
    and his children  and  any  alleged  interference  that  removal  would
    engender.

10. I considered that in failing to give any regard to the,  albeit  brief,
    evidence that was before him about the children and the relevance  such
    might have in  striking  a  balance  between  the  public  interest  in
    enforcing immigration control and private and family life  connections,
    the judge materially erred.

    Rehearing

11. There being no challenge to the decision under the  Rules  I  concluded
    that the appropriate course was to rehear  the  matter  in  respect  of
    Article 8 outside the Rules.  No objection was made by either  side  to
    the case proceeding at that hearing.  I heard brief evidence  from  the
    Appellant and Mr Addo.

12. The Appellant adopted her statement (6 May 2016).  Asked about children
    of the family, she said she has two children who are aged  36  and  32,
    both are British citizens.  Her husband has two  girls  by  a  previous
    relationship.  They are aged 19 and 17.  They live with  their  mother.
    He sees them during the day every other week or fortnight usually at  a
    park or in a pub.  She herself has met the girls.

13. Mr Addo also adopted his statement  (6  May  2016).   He  works  as  an
    engineer with London Underground earning around  �40,000  a  year.   He
    supports his daughters, paying �508 a  month  maintenance  through  the
    Child Support Agency.  He also supports them  emotionally.   They  live
    with their mother.  He and his children meet every week or two  usually
    in a local park.  If precluded from meeting  by  his  work  commitments
    they talk on the phone.

14. He said he would not be happy to leave the UK.  His daughters would  be
    phoning him all the time.  He and they are close.

15. Asked if they were present at the hearing to support the appeal he said
    they are at art college.  They are revising.  They would not have  come
    even if he had asked them.

16. In submissions, Mr Avery said there was little evidence  of  compelling
    or exceptional circumstance within  or  outwith  the  Rules.   Even  in
    respect of Mr Addo's children they are not  living  with  him  and  the
    Appellant.  Whilst they  might  meet  fairly  regularly  there  was  no
    indication of a particularly close relationship.  He has indicated that
    he would not move to live in Ghana.  If so there was no reason  to  see
    why she should not return there and seek entry clearance.

17. In Ms Record's submission there was  sufficient  evidence  to  conclude
    that there is family life between Mr Addo and his children.   It  is  a
    modern day family unit with his children from a previous  relationship.
    They  depend  on  him  financially  and  emotionally.   It   would   be
    unreasonable to expect him to leave them.

18. In fact, she noted, his position is that he would not leave the  UK  to
    live in Ghana so matters fall back on the Appellant.  An adverse factor
    was that she was an overstayer.  However, she speaks English and  there
    is no issue with maintenance and accommodation.  In  the  circumstances
    it would be unduly harsh to require her to return  to  Ghana  and  make
    entry clearance.

    Consideration

19. In considering this matter, as indicated, no challenge was made to  the
    dismissal of the appeal under the Rules.

20. As for Article 8 outside the  Rules  the  first  issue  is  family  and
    private life.  There is clearly family life between the  Appellant  and
    her husband Mr Addo.  It was not suggested there is family life between
    the Appellant and her children who are both  in  their  thirties.   She
    appears to have grandchildren although no evidence was  led  about  any
    involvement she may have with them.  I  accept  there  is  family  life
    between Mr Addo and his daughters by a previous relationship.  They are
    aged 19  and  17.   Although  neither  attended  the  hearing  or  gave
    statements I see no reason to doubt the evidence that Mr Addo is  close
    to his daughters  and  that  they  meet  or  otherwise  keep  in  touch
    regularly.  The Appellant said she had met the girls.  That apart there
    was no evidence of any particular emotional connection between her  and
    them.

21. The Appellant has been in the UK  since  2010.   There  is  effectively
    nothing before me other than that she has been here since then and  the
    limited family ties to indicate the establishment  of  any  significant
    private life built up since then.

22. Mr Addo's position is that he would not leave the UK.   As  such  there
    would be no disruption  to  any  family  life  that  he  has  with  his
    children.  The main interference with family life would, of course,  be
    between the Appellant and her husband.

23. Any such interference would be  in  accordance  with  the  law  and  in
    pursuit of a legitimate aim.  The issue  is  whether  the  decision  is
    necessary  in  a  democratic   society,   including   whether   it   is
    disproportionate to the legitimate aim of immigration control.

24. The Appellant speaks English and it was not suggested she is  a  burden
    on taxpayers.  Her husband earns a significant salary in his  work  for
    London Underground.  However, an Appellant can obtain no positive right
    to a grant of leave to remain from either s117B (2)  or  (3),  whatever
    the degree of fluency in English, or  the  strength  of  her  financial
    resources.

25.  I can give little weight to any private life as she has been in the UK
    unlawfully since 2010.

26. In respect of the children of her husband it is in their best interests
    for them to remain with their mother who is their primary carer.  There
    is no reason why continued contact with their father could not continue
    by phone or personal contact.  As he will not be  leaving  the  UK  the
    current situation can remain unchanged financially and emotionally.  As
    indicated there is no evidence  of  any  particular  ties  between  the
    Appellant and her husband's family

27. On other matters it is not in her favour in the balancing exercise that
    she has spent the vast majority of her life in Ghana and there would be
    no issues of language or culture to cope with were she to  return.   It
    seems clear that her husband would be able financially to  support  her
    while she is there.

28. Nothing was put before me to indicate any significant medical issues.

29. Her complete disregard for the laws of this country by overstaying  for
    five years before bringing herself to the attention of the  authorities
    does not assist her in the balancing exercise.

30. As also indicated it was not argued by Ms  Record  that  the  Appellant
    could satisfy the Rules which also does not assist her.

31. The  consequence  of  the  Appellant  being  removed  and  her  husband
    remaining might be, although no evidence was given on this matter, that
    the marriage could not be sustained in the long-term.  The Respondent's
    position is that the Appellant could seek entry clearance from Ghana.

32. Ms Record made reference  to  Hayat  (nature  of  Chikwamba  principle)
    Pakistan v SSHD [2011] UKUT 00444 at

         '23.     The significance of Chikwamba, however, is to  make  plain
             that, where the only matter weighing on the Respondent's  side
             of the balance is the public policy of requiring a  person  to
             apply under the Rules from abroad, that  legitimate  objective
             will  usually  be  outweighed  by  factors  resting   on   the
             Appellant's side of the balance.

         24.   Viewed  correctly,  the   Chikwamba   principle   does   not,
             accordingly, automatically trump anything on the state's side,
             such as a poor immigration history.  Conversely, the principle
             cannot be simply "switched off" on mechanistic  grounds,  such
             as because children are not involved ...'

33. In fact the Upper Tribunal decision was appealed to the Court of Appeal
    (SSHD v Hayat; SSHD v Treebhawon (Mauritius) [2012] EWCA Civ 1054).

34. There, at [30], the court said:

         "In my judgement, the effect of these decisions can  be  summarised
         as follows:

         ...

         a)   Where an applicant who does not have  lawful  entry  clearance
             pursues an Article 8 claim, a dismissal of the  claim  on  the
             procedural ground that the policy requires that the  applicant
             should have made the application from his home state may  (but
             not necessarily will) constitute a  disruption  of  family  or
             private life sufficient  to  engage  Article  8,  particularly
             where children are adversely affected.

         b)   Where Article 8 is engaged,  it  will  be  a  disproportionate
             interference with family or private life  to  enforce  such  a
             policy unless, to use the language of Sullivan LJ there  is  a
             sensible reason for doing so.

         c)   Whether it is sensible to enforce that policy will necessarily
             be fact sensitive, Lord Brown identified  certain  potentially
             relevant  factors  in  Chikwamba.   They  will   include   the
             prospective length and degree of disruption of family life and
             whether other members of the family are settled in the UK.

         d)   Where Article 8 is engaged and there is no sensible reason for
             enforcing the policy, the decision maker should determine  the
             Article 8 claim on its substantive merits,  having  regard  to
             all material factors, notwithstanding that the  Appellant  has
             no lawful entry clearance."

35. In R (on the application of Chen) v SSHD (Appendix  FM -  Chikwamba -
    temporary separation - proportionality) IJR  [2015]  UKUT  00189,  the
    Tribunal (at [36]) stated:

         'I do not accept that, in using the phrase 'sensible reason', Elias
         LJ was setting out the test for applying the guidance in Chikwamba,
         nor that he reversed the burden of proof.  The burden remains  upon
         the applicant to place before the Secretary of State  all  material
         that he or she relies upon to suggest that removal pursuant to  the
         refusal of leave would breach Article 8'.

36. Finally, at [39]

         'In my judgement, if it is shown  by  the  individual  (the  burden
         being upon him or her) that an application for  entry  from  abroad
         would be granted and that there would be  significant  interference
         with family life by temporary removal, the weight to be accorded to
         the formal requirement of obtaining entry clearance is reduced.  In
         cases involving children, where removal would  interfere  with  the
         child's enjoyment of family life with one or other of  his  or  her
         parents whilst entry clearance is obtained, it will  be  easier  to
         show that the balance of proportionality falls  in  favour  of  the
         claimant than in cases which do  not  involve  children  but  where
         removal interferes with family life between parties  who  knowingly
         entered into the relationship in the knowledge that family life was
         being established whilst the immigration status of  one  party  was
         'precarious'.  In other words, in the  former  case,  it  would  be
         easier to show that the individual's circumstances fall within  the
         minority envisaged by the House of Lords in Huang or the exceptions
         referred to in the judgements of the ECtHR than in the latter case.
          However, it all depends on the facts'.

37. In this case the Appellant has made no case as to any form of  hardship
    that she and/or her husband would suffer if she were required  to  make
    an application for entry clearance.

38. The Appellant's leave had expired well before she  and  Mr  Addo  began
    their relationship.  They were married in the full knowledge  that  she
    did not have leave and that she had no lawful status. It may be that an
    entry clearance application would satisfy the Rules.  However,  on  the
    facts of this case there is no  evidence  of  significant  interference
    with family life that would be caused by temporary removal.   Nor  that
    the prospective length of  disruption  would  be  anything  other  than
    temporary.

39. There is no evidence of interference to any  connection  she  may  have
    with her adult children and her grandchildren.  As indicated there  was
    no evidence of any particular connection with her  husband's  children.
    There is no reason why during a  temporary  separation  she  could  not
    easily keep in touch with her husband and others in the families.

40. I also see no reason why, if they wished it, her husband could  not  go
    with her to support her temporarily.  Again there was no evidence  that
    any disruption would be severe.  It was not suggested that a  temporary
    period in Ghana would preclude  him  from  continuing  financially  and
    emotionally to support his daughters.  The effects on his children  and
    interference with family life, on the evidence before me, would not  be
    major.  I conclude that there is a sensible reason  for  enforcing  the
    policy.

41. For these various reasons on  the  facts  of  this  particular  case  I
    conclude that removal would not be disproportionate to  the  legitimate
    aim of immigration control.  The appeal fails on Article 8 grounds.

Notice of Decision
