For the Appellant:     Mr Islam, Fountain Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Iraq  born  in  1989.  He  appeals  with
    permission the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Broe)  to
    dismiss his protection appeal.


 2. There were two limbs to the  Appellant's  case  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

              i) That he had a well-founded fear of persecution for  reasons
                 of his political opinion/ethnicity viz  that  as  a  former
                 peshmerga he was 'wanted' by the Shi'ite militia Hashd  al-
                 Shaabi in his home area of Tuz Khurmato;


             ii) In the  alternative  his  appeal  should  be  allowed  with
                 reference to Article 15(b) of the  Qualification  Directive
                 and/or Article 3 ECHR pursuant to the Secretary of  State's
                 concession  in  SMO  and  Others  (Article  15(c)  identity
                 documents) Iraq CG [2019] UKUT  400  that  an  undocumented
                 returnee, who is unable to  re-document  himself  within  a
                 reasonable time frame, will face a  real  risk  of  falling
                 into destitution.


 3. The First-tier Tribunal found  against  the  appellant  on  both  these
    matters and the appeal was dismissed. The submissions before me take no
    issue with the Tribunal's conclusion in respect of (i), save that there
    is disagreement with the Tribunal's finding that the Appellant  is  not
    in fact from Tuz Khurmato. The focus of the challenge in this  Tribunal
    relates to the findings in respect of (ii).




    Error of Law: Discussion and Findings

      Tuz Khurmato


 4. By her refusal letter dated the 22nd July 2019 the Respondent  had  not
    accepted that the Appellant  was  from  Tuz  Khurmato  as  claimed.  At
    interview he had not been able to correctly name the Mayor of the  town
    when he left, said that the river Awa Spi was to the south when  it  is
    to the north, and said that there were no mountains in the area when in
    fact the entire town is overlooked from the west by mountains.  He also
    gave a history of fighting in the  area  inconsistent  with  the  known
    background evidence, and denied that there is a hospital  in  the  city
    when there is one.  The  Appellant's  explanation  for  most  of  these
    difficulties in his evidence was that he had  suffered  a  head  injury
    after being assaulted by a militiaman and his memory was poor.  He  had
    largely stayed hidden in his house for five years between 2012 and 2017
    so could recall little about the town.  On the issue of who  the  Mayor
    was, the Appellant maintained that he was right and the Respondent  had
    got her information wrong.


 5. The First-tier Tribunal was prepared to accept that the Respondent  may
    be poorly informed about who the Mayor of  Tuz  Khurmato  was  but  was
    unable to accept, even to the lower standard, that someone who  claimed
    to be a shepherd did not know that  the  locality  was  mountainous  or
    where the river ran.  There was  no  medical  evidence  supporting  his
    claim to have lost his memory in respect of his home town. His evidence
    about fighting against Hashd al-Shaabi in  2012  ran  contrary  to  the
    objective evidence showing that this organisation came  into  being  in
    2014.  For various additional reasons that I need not set out here  the
    entire account was found to be lacking in credibility.

 6. The grounds as originally drafted take no issue with  the  findings  in
    respect  of  the  Appellant's  origins.  However  in  further   written
    submissions, drafted in response to 'Covid-19 directions' made by Upper
    Tribunal Judge Grubb in June 2020, it is submitted  that  the  Tribunal
    here failed to take into account all of the correct  answers  that  the
    Appellant gave at his interview when asked  about  that  locality.   Mr
    McVeety objected to the grounds being amended in this way and asked  me
    to exclude the written submissions.

 7. In fact it is a controversy I need not resolve,  since  the  ground  is
    unarguable. The Appellant did, I accept, manage to give  some  accurate
    information about Tuz Khurmato,  but  even  taking  all  of  that  into
    account his narrative was fatally undermined  by  the  significant  and
    blatant  inconsistencies  identified  in   the   determination.    Even
    accounting for the difficulties that many people have  in  providing  a
    coherent timeline, it is, as the First-tier Tribunal found, not at  all
    credible that a shepherd would  be  unable  to  describe  the  dominant
    physical features of his surroundings and  his  claim  to  have  memory
    problems was not supported by medical evidence. The First-tier Tribunal
    was quite entitled to reject the Appellant's claim that he is from  Tuz
    Khurmato.

    Documentation

 8. The Appellant  does  have  permission  to  argue  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal erred in its approach to whether the would be able  to  obtain
    new documentation in Iraq, enabling him to access basic services.   The
    Respondent accepts that in the absence of such documentation  or  other
    support he would face a real risk of falling into destitution such that
    would  engage  the  United  Kingdom's  obligations  under   Article   3
    ECHR/Article 15(b) of the Qualification Directive.


 9. Mr McVeety accepts that in  at  least  some  respects,  the  First-tier
    Tribunal did err. At its �35 the decision reads:

         "He has not offered any reason why he could not in any event obtain
         a replacement passport from the Iraqi embassy or engage a lawyer in
         Iraq to obtain identity documents".

10. Here, Mr McVeety accepts, the Tribunal failed to  have  regard  to  the
    guidance in SMO and Others (Article 15(c) identity documents)  Iraq  CG
    [2019] UKUT 400 to the effect that where  the  Iraqi  authorities  have
    rolled out the new biometric 'INID' system, it is no longer possible to
    acquire new documents by proxy. The individual himself must attend  the
    relevant civil registration office. Further, the Tribunal's notion that
    the consulate in London could provide documentation has been  overtaken
    by events in that the Respondent accepts, in the June 2020  CPIN  Iraq:
    Internal relocation, civil documentation and returns that this  is  not
    going to happen:


         2.6.16 Based on the above information, it is highly  unlikely  that
         an individual would be able to obtain a CSID from the Iraqi Embassy
         while in the UK. Instead  a  person  would  need  to  apply  for  a
         registration document (1957) and would then apply for an INID  upon
         return to their local CSA office in Iraq.


11. Mr McVeety further accepted that another error of fact appears  at  the
    First-tier Tribunal's �37 where it finds that the  Appellant  would  be
    returned to the IKR.   In fact, as an involuntary return, he was always
    being sent to Baghdad.


12. Having accepted that the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  contains
    those difficulties, Mr McVeety was not  prepared  to  accept  that  the
    decision should be set aside.  I return to the question of  materiality
    below.

13. The grounds themselves focus on an entirely different paragraph.  Issue
    is taken with the Tribunal's �34 where it says this: "I do  not  accept
    that he has no such documents or  family  support  in  Iraq".  This  is
    criticised as speculation, and comparison is drawn  with  the  form  of
    words used by the First-tier  Tribunal  in  the  appeal  of  SMO:  "the
    appellant's CSID was 'possibly' at the family home". In SMO  the  Upper
    Tribunal held that this was insufficiently clear reasoning.

14. I am not persuaded that such unclear findings have been made here.  The
    Appellant advanced an account which is expressly rejected by the First-
    tier Tribunal for several very  sound  reasons.   It  is  against  this
    background that  the  Tribunal  concludes  that  the  Appellant's  bare
    assertions about any matter - including the whereabouts of  his  family
    or documents - attract insufficient weight to discharge the  burden  of
    proof. Furthermore the Tribunal  has  specific  reason  to  reject  the
    evidence on this matter [at �30]:

         "The Appellant is adamant that he  has  had  no  contact  with  his
         family  since  he  left  Iraq.  On  his  account  they  provided  a
         significant amount of money to an intermediary who paid  the  agent
         in instalments for the various parts of  his  journey.  It  follows
         that there must have been  a  line  of  communication  between  the
         Appellant or the agent and  the  intermediary  or  the  Appellant's
         family. Logic  dictates  that  the  Appellant's  family  must  have
         approved  the  instalments  and  were  therefore   aware   of   the
         Appellant's location. I do not find it credible that the  Appellant
         has had no contact with his family. At least  they  would  want  to
         know that he had arrived safely in this country. If, as he  claims,
         they have disappeared, there would be no need for the  intermediary
         to hold the money".

15. I am satisfied that Judge Broe's reasoning on this point is flawed  for
    neither perversity nor impermissible speculation. The finding that  the
    Appellant has failed to show that he has lost touch with his family  is
    free from error and is upheld.

16. I return to the points made by Mr McVeety. It was his  submission  that
    the difficulties with the Tribunal's reasoning at its �35 and �37  made
    no difference to the outcome of the appeal. For  the  following  simple
    reason, he is correct.

17. The decision in SMO gives claimants who would otherwise fail  something
    of a lifeline in its findings about documentation. At its �317 it  says
    this:

         The starting point for our consideration must be  the  respondent's
         repetition, at [150] of her closing submissions, of her  concession
         in previous cases that "it  remains  the  position  that  a  person
         returning to Iraq without either family connections able to  assist
         him, or the means to obtain a CSID, may  be  at  risk  of  enduring
         conditions contrary to  Article  3  ECHR".   This  section  of  our
         decision is therefore principally relevant to those who have or are
         able to obtain a CSID (or INID) within a reasonable  time  or  have
         family members from whom they can secure assistance or support.


18. From there it goes on to find that the Respondent's concession will  be
    engaged in circumstances where the  returnee  is  in  effect  stuck  in
    Baghdad, either because he does  not  have  family  members  who  could
    assist him (by bringing existing, or newly issued documentation to  him
    there -  enabling him to travel  within  the  country  and  accordingly
    reach home) or because he is from an area where the new INID  terminals
    are installed and his physical presence is required before a card  will
    be issued.  Where a claimant can prove, to the lower standard, that  he
    will falls within these categories, his claim will succeed pursuant  to
    the Respondent's concession. This Appellant, however, has  been  unable
    to  establish  either  matter.  Judge  Broe  expressly   rejected   the
    Appellant's claim that he has lost touch with his family. He is  unable
    to establish that his home civil registry is now issuing INIDS, because
    nobody knows where he is from. As Mr McVeety puts  it,  the  First-tier
    Tribunal was being asked to solve a jigsaw puzzle with half the  pieces
    missing.    The burden of proof lay, in all matters, on the  Appellant,
    and he failed to discharge it. In those circumstances any error in  the
    Tribunal's approach, as outlined above, was immaterial.



    Anonymity


19. The Appellant continues to seek international protection. As such I  am
    satisfied,  having had regard  to  the  guidance  in  the  Presidential
    Guidance Note No  1  of  2013:  Anonymity  Orders,  that  it  would  be
    appropriate to make an order in accordance with Rule 14 of the Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 in the following terms:


        "Unless and until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his
        family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
        Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
        direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"



    Decisions


20. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains no material error
    of law and it is upheld.


21. There is an order for anonymity.
