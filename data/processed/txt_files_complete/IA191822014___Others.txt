For the Respondent:    Mr N. Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. In a decision promulgated on  17  February  2015,  First-tier  Tribunal
    ("FtT") Judge Bart-Stewart dismissed the appellants' appeal against the
    decision of the respondent, dated 16 April  2014,  to  refuse  to  vary
    their leave to remain and remove them from the UK.

 2. The appellants are citizens of Pakistan. The first appellant  was  born
    on 1 June 1984. The second appellant, his wife, was born on  26  August
    1991. The third appellant is their son who was born on 14 October 2012.



 3. The first appellant entered the UK on  18  September  2008  with  entry
    clearance as a student. He  obtained  variations  of  his  leave  as  a
    student and thereafter was granted leave to  remain  as  Tier  1  (Post
    Study) Migrant until 21 October 2013. On 18 October 2013 he applied for
    leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant  under  the  points-
    based system.  The second and third appellants  applied  for  leave  to
    remain as his dependents.

 4.  The  respondent  refused  the  first  appellants'  application   under
    Paragraph 245DD(k) of the Immigration Rules; that  is,  on  the  ground
    that she was not satisfied as to the genuineness  of  the  application.
    The respondent considered that the first appellant  did  not  meet  the
    requirements of Paragraph 245DD(h) of the Immigration Rules taking into
    consideration the  factors  listed  in  paragraph  245DD(i).   The  key
    findings of the respondent were:

      a. The first appellant was required to have access to at least �50,000
         to invest in a business. Although  he  provided  a  bank  statement
         showing  sufficient  funds,  the  respondent  did  not  accept  the
         viability and credibility of the source of the money.

      b. The respondent was  of  the  view  that  the  first  appellant  had
         plagiarised a large part of his business plan  and  had  failed  to
         adequately  explain  his  business  and  therefore  the  respondent
         questioned the viability and credibility of the business  plan  and
         market research.

 5. The appellants appealed and their appeal was heard by FtT  Judge  Bart-
    Stewart.  The FtT dismissed the appellants' appeal. The judge  did  not
    find it credible that the first  appellant  would  have  been  able  to
    accumulate �35,000 during the time he was in the UK (he claimed to have
    received �15,000 as wedding money and saved  �35,000).  The  FtT  noted
    that at the beginning of the statement period on 10 September 2013  the
    balance was just over �10,000 and on 16 October it was over �50,000 and
    there was no documentary evidence to show how this money was earned and
    saved. The FtT concluded that the first appellant had failed to show he
    genuinely intended to invest the money in the business.

 6. The FtT also considered the viability and credibility of  the  business
    as set out in the business plan. It stated that the  'financials'  made
    no sense and found that parts of the  business  plan  had  been  copied
    without any attempt to vary the wording. Moreover, the judge found that
    the first appellant's answers  to  questions  in  interview  about  his
    market research caused doubt as to whether he had  properly  researched
    the proposed business.  The FtT concluded that the first appellant  had
    failed  to  discharge  the  burden  of  proof  that  he  is  a  genuine
    entrepreneur. Article 8 was also  considered  and  it  was  found  that
    removal of the appellants would not be disproportionate.

 7. The grounds of appeal submit that the FtT erred in law because  matters
    such as the source of funds and the business plan are not  requirements
    in  and  of  themselves  under  the  Rules  and  the   strict   factual
    requirements under the points-based system were met.

 8. The grounds also submit that the judge failed to take into account that
    the  business  had  already  been  established   when   assessing   the
    genuineness of the application.

 9. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal  Judge  Blum.  Judge
    Blum stated that the FtT  was  entitled  to  consider  the  absence  of
    reliable evidence as to the origin of the funds available to the  first
    appellant and the evidence of the business plan being plagiarised  when
    considering the credibility of the business. However, he found  it  was
    arguable that the FtT had failed to consider the fact that the business
    was already established.

10. At the error of law hearing Ms Jones,  on  behalf  of  the  appellants,
    submitted that the FtT, in  assessing  the  genuineness  of  the  first
    appellant's application, had failed to consider the evidence before  it
    showing that, and  the  extent  to  which,  the  business  was  already
    operating at the time the application was made to the  respondent.  She
    contended that this evidence showed that the first appellant had indeed
    set up a genuine business that had customers, a reasonable turnover and
    a profit. Mr Bramble argued  that  there  was  little  in  the  way  of
    evidence showing the  business  operating  successfully  and  that  the
    evidence of the first appellant's income from  prior  to  the  business
    being incorporated was not relevant.

Consideration

11. The appellants' application was made on 18 October 2014. The FtT  could
    only take into account evidence submitted at that time  unless  it  was
    adduced to prove a document was genuine or  valid  (see,  for  example,
    Ahmed and Another (PBS: admissible evidence) [2014] UKUT 00365 (IAC)).

12. The documents submitted by the first  appellant  with  his  application
    included:

      a. Companies House Register  Information  showing  his  company  being
         incorporated on 16 September 2013 with the first appellant as  sole
         director and the certificate of incorporation.

      b. An undated  but  signed  contract  between  the  first  appellant's
         company and another company for provision of services to the latter
         from October 2013 until October 2015 paying  �1,450  a  month.  The
         contract  refers  to  the  first  appellant's   company   providing
         "marketing services and staff".  The  contract  gives  very  little
         specificity as to what services will be delivered in return for the
         regular remuneration but refers to preparing monthly marketing  and
         sales  forecasts,  weekly  marketing  reports,  operational  review
         reports and sales reports.

      c. An undated but signed contract with another  third  party  company.
         The contract is virtually identical  to  the  previously  described
         contract,  whereby  the  first  appellant's  company  will  provide
         "marketing services and staff" but in this contract the  period  of
         performance is April 2014 until March 2015 and the monthly  fee  is
         �1,200.

      d. A document from HMRC confirming the appellant's  company  has  been
         notified to them by Companies House.

      e. The first appellant's tax return as a self employed person for  the
         tax year ending 5 April 2013, showing turnover  of  �36,010,  total
         allowable expenses of �22,309 and total taxable profits of �13,701,
         with total tax paid of �1,667.84.

13. Taken together, these documents show, on the balance of  probabilities,
    that the first appellant was operating a business at the  time  of  his
    application and that the business in the previous tax year had  made  a
    reasonable turnover (over �36,000) and modest  profit  (�13,701).   The
    fact that the legal status of the business changed  in  September  2013
    does not negate that this was an ongoing business.  Paragraph  245D  of
    the Immigration Rules defines "business" as a "sole trader, partnership
    or company registered in the UK" and therefore both  before  and  after
    incorporating the appellant was operating his business.

14. Paragraph 245DD(h)(i) of  the  Immigration  Rules  is  drafted  in  the
    alternative. It provides that the respondent must be satisfied that the
    applicant genuinely either (1) intends and is able to  establish,  take
    over or become a director of one or more businesses in  the  UK  within
    the next six months; or (2) has established, taken  over  or  become  a
    director of one or more businesses in the UK and continues  to  operate
    that business or businesses.

15. The FtT approached its consideration of the viability  and  credibility
    of the business from the perspective of it being a mere proposal rather
    than an operating business.  This was an error of  law,  as  the  FtT's
    starting point should have been that the business was  already  up  and
    running; that is, the second of the two alternatives under 245DD(h)(i).
    The error was not, however, material, for the reasons explained below.

16. Under Paragraph 245DD(h)(ii) and (iii) of the Rules, the  Secretary  of
    State must be satisfied that (a) the  appellant  genuinely  intends  to
    invest �50,000 in the business; (b) this money is  genuinely  available
    to the appellant; and (c) the money will remain available until  it  is
    spent for the purposes of the businesses.

17. At paragraph [17] the FtT set out the reasons it did not find the first
    appellant genuinely intended to invest  �50,000  in  his  business.  It
    noted that as of 10 September 2013 the sum  in  the  first  appellant's
    bank account was �10, 136.11 and this increased  to  �50,099.53  on  16
    October 2013 without  there  being  an  adequate  explanation  for  its
    source. The FtT considered the first  appellant's  work  history  since
    coming to the UK and his capacity to accumulate  sufficient  funds  and
    reached the conclusion that it was not credible that he  had  saved  as
    much as he claimed. These findings were open to the FtT which, based on
    the evidence before  it,  was  entitled  to  conclude  that  the  first
    appellant had failed to show he genuinely intended to invest �50,000 in
    the business.

18. To succeed, the first appellant was required show, inter alia, that  he
    met the requirements  of  both  paragraph  245DD(h)(i)  and  paragraphs
    245DD(h)(ii) and (iii);  that  is,  the  Secretary  of  State  must  be
    satisfied that the appellant genuinely intends  both  to  establish  or
    continue operating a business and invest �50,000  into  that  business.
    These requirements are cumulative, ie the first appellant must show  he
    satisfies both. The FtT found that he could not satisfy either. For the
    reasons explained above, I find that  the  FtT  erred  in  relation  to
    paragraph 245DD(h)(i), as the judge failed to take  into  account  that
    the first appellant  was  continuing  to  operate  a  business  he  had
    established and so could meet the requirements of  245DD(h)(i)(2),  but
    not in respect of paragraph 245DD(h)(ii), where  it  was  open  to  the
    judge to find that the appellant had not shown a genuine  intention  to
    invest �50,000 in the business.  The finding in respect of the  �50,000
    was a sufficient basis to dismiss the appeal and therefore the error in
    relation to the operation of the  business  was  not  material  to  the
    outcome.

Decision

 a. The appeal is dismissed.

 b. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of a
    material error of law and shall stand.

 c. No anonymity order is made.
