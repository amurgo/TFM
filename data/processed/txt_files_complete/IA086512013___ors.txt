For the Appellant:     Ms Niama of Berkshire Law Chamber
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1. The first appellant applied for leave to remain as a Tier 1 migrant,
       the two other appellants being his dependants.


    2. The appellants submitted their application on 2nd April  2011  which
       was refused on 14th September 2011 with no  right  of  appeal  (they
       still had extant leave to remain in  the  UK).  Further  submissions
       were made which the respondent refused to entertain on 24th  October
       2011. Further evidence was submitted on 21st February 2012 which the
       respondent again refused to  entertain.  Following  judicial  review
       proceedings  and  a  consent  order   those   further   submissions,
       additional submissions dated 14th October  2012  and  evidence  were
       reconsidered by the respondent and on 6th March 2013 the  respondent
       refused the application which this time had a right of appeal.

    3. The application was refused under paragraph 322(1A)  and  245(c)  on
       the grounds that the bank deposit statements submitted by  him  were
       false and  that  the  points  claimed  for  previous  earnings  were
       insufficient.


    4. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis that it  was  arguable
       that the First-tier Tribunal judge appeared to have found  that  the
       bank statements were false at least in part because there was strong
       evidence to suggest corruption  within  banks  in  Pakistan  without
       evidence to support such a finding and that the judge  was  arguably
       wrong in finding in favour of the respondent when the appellant  had
       submitted a bank letter and email to confirm the authenticity of the
       account information.


    5. The respondent's case was that the current deposit account statement
       submitted with the application in support of overseas  earnings  was
       not genuine and thus  the  dividends  from  that  account  had  been
       discounted. The respondent relied on the response to enquiries  made
       by her to the bank which confirmed that the documents had  not  been
       issued by them.  The appellant produced further  documentation  from
       the bank  dated  11th  October  2011  which  the  respondent,  after
       enquiries, with the bank,  concluded  was  genuine.  The  respondent
       stated that the bank had confirmed that the deposit account had been
       opened in October 2011 and that therefore the  information  supplied
       previously purporting to show that  the  account  was  in  operation
       between 10 April 2011 and 28 June 2011 was not genuine.

    6. The correspondence trail as regards the disputed bank documents is
       as follows:

    (a)  28.06.11              letter from  the  Bank  of  Azad  Jammu  and
         Kashmir (Tatta Pani Branch) (hereafter "AJK - TPBranch")  addressed
         To Whom It May Concern
    (b)  11.10.11          letter from AJK-RPBranch addressed  To  Whom  It
         May Concern
    (c)  01/04/11 - 28/06/11   Current Deposit Statement of AJK-TPBranch
    (d)  01/07/11- 30-09-11    Current deposit  Statement  of  AJK-TPBranch


    (e)  01/07/11 -11/10/11    Current Deposit Statement of AJK-TPBranch
    (f)  05.08.11          DVR verifying (c) above false
    (g)  31.10.12          letter from AJK Divisional  Head  of  Operations
         confirming  (c)  above  false;  (e)  above  genuine;  (e)   account
         operative since 4 October 2011 at Tatapani branch.
    (h)  05.12.12          DVR verifying (e) genuine; account did not exist
         until October 2011; draws the conclusion again that (c) above false
    (i)  03.07.13          Letter addressed To Whom  It  May  Concern  from
         Manager  AJK-TPBranch  stating  that  appellant's  account   opened
         manually in 2009
    (j)  12.07.13          Letter addressed To Whom It May Concern from AJK
         Head Office Divisional Manager Operations
    (k)  06.08.13          (and chasing emails) email by respondent to  AJK
         Head Office requesting verification of  letters  from  AJK-TPBranch
         dated 03.07.13 and 12.07.13 addressed to appellant
    (l)  17.09.13(?)           Email from AJK  Head  Office  to  respondent
         confirming letters dated 03.07.13 and 12.07.13 is  fake;  and  that
         they are investigating further
    (m)  17.09.13          DVR stating information as in (l) above.
    (n)  02/11/13              email  from  appellant  to  Divisional  Head
         Operations AJK bank
    (o)  06/11/13          reply email from Divisional Head Operations  AJK
         bank to            appellant
    (p)  11.11.13          Letter from the State Bank of  Pakistan  to  the
         appellant

    7. The letter purporting to come from the Manager of  the  TJK-TPBranch
       dated 3rd July 2013 states


             ...Please note Our bank branch was opened in  2009  and  since
             then it has been running its operations manually. The  inquiry
             by the Head Office has been done by using  out  online  system
             and as this account was opened manually it would not exist  on
             our online system...His account transactions  from  1st  April
             2011 to 28th June 2011 are genuine  according  to  our  manual
             customer record system


    8. The letter purporting to come from the Divisional Manager Operations
       Head Office dated 12 July 2013 states


             ....We write this  letter  in  relation  to  the  [appellant's
             account] and further to the letter dated 31 October written by
             Mr Ghulam Hussain (Divisional Head Operations).
             It is  hereby  certified  that  the  above  mentioned  account
             enquiry was done using our online banking system. The relevant
             bank branch [TKP-TPBranch] was managing the account  manually.
             Therefore the account record of the [appellant] before October
             2011 was unavailable to Mr Ghulam Hussain at the time  of  the
             enquiry, as one would have to physically go and or contact the
             specific branch to retrieve the manual  records  in  order  to
             obtain the relevant information required.
             Therefore  after  visiting  the  specific  bank   branch   and
             physically checking the manual  record  of  [the  appellant's]
             account, it is hereby confirmed that  [the  appellant]  opened
             his account...on 01 April 2011 at Tatta Pani branch...and  has
             since been regularly maintaining his account since then.
             This account is a  genuine  bank  account  and  the  statement
             issued by the bank dated from 01-04-2011 to 28-06-2011 showing
             all the bank transactions on the statement do genuinely  exist
             in our manually kept records in the specific  bank  branch  in
             Tatta Pani...
             Therefore the letter dated 31 October 2012 issued by Mr Ghulam
             Hussain  (Divisional  Head  Operations)  was  an  error....and
             should be disregarded


    9. The bank statement for the period 01.04.2011 to 20.06.2011  shows  a
       first transaction on 01.04.11 as "By TR (CGS) 1500". On  an  amended
       copy of what looks like a computer generated  statement  handwritten
       figures have been  written  in;  it  appears  this  is  because  the
       photocopy of the statement in the various bundles is not legible for
       those figures. These were the only manually transcribed  figures  in
       the document. I drew the attention of the appellant's representative
       to the statement as appearing to be computer generated rather than a
       manual record; she responded that her  instructions  were  that  the
       account was manually run until October 2011.


   10. The bank statement for the period 01.07.2011 to  30.09.2011  appears
       to be computer generated and has no manual additions. The address on
       this statement is a shortened form of  that  which  appears  on  the
       statement  for  the  period  01.04.2011  to  20.06.2011.  The   bank
       statement for the period 01.07.2011 to 11.10.2011  is  in  the  same
       general format although the address includes what could be a  street
       or road name.

   11. The email at (o) above asserts that the letters dated  3  July  2013
       and 12 July 2013 were issued according to the bank's manual records.
       Those letters assert that the manual records were not  available  to
       online enquiries and that Mr Ghulam  Hussain  (the  Divisional  Head
       Operations) would not have been able to verify the existence of  the
       account without physically going to or contacting the specific  bank
       to retrieve the information.  The letter from Mr  Hussain  dated  31
       October 2012 states

             It is informed that on receipt of your previous enquiry  dated
             August 11, 2011 the above named person was not maintaining his
             account with our Tatta Pani Branch, and hence we  reported  it
             as "Fake Statement".
             However on receipt of your latest  enquiry  dated  August  13,
             2012, we reported that the [appellant]  has  been  maintaining
             his [account], being operative since October 04, 2011  at  our
             Tatapani branch....

   12. The appellant also relies upon a letter he received from  the  State
       Bank of Pakistan dated 11-11-2013 in response to his  enquiry  dated
       21/10/2013 which states


             I have made investigations with Tatta  Pani  branch....It  was
             confirmed by the relevant branch  that  your  above  mentioned
             Account was opened on 1-04-2011....
             I have further confirmed from BAJK  Head  Office  Muzaffarabad
             and they confirmed the  account  opening  date  is  4-10-2011.
             After further investigations they confirmed  that  the  actual
             account opening date is 01April 2011, but that record  is  not
             available in their computerized data.


             So at our end we can confirm that the actual date  of  account
             opening is 1-04-2011.


   13. The appellant submits, in essence, that the evidence produced by him
       was sufficiently cogent to dispel the previously notified statements
       that he had produced forged documents and that the  failure  of  the
       respondent to make further enquiries in  some  way  ameliorated  the
       weight to be placed upon the initial evidence supplied. Dealing with
       the second issue first this is not a situation where the  respondent
       is best placed to obtain the evidence required. The burden  is  upon
       the appellant to prove his case. The  documents  initially  produced
       had been declared forgeries by  the  Bank.  Although  the  appellant
       subsequently produced further documentation purporting to show  this
       not to be the case, that subsequent evidence was not from  the  same
       people who  had  produced  the  initial  assessment;  there  was  no
       explanation why different people had been approached;  the  bank  in
       question  (despite  having  notified  the   respondent   they   were
       investigating further and despite the email to the appellant stating
       they had investigated) did not contact the respondent direct  again.
       The bank statements on their face do not look like manually produced
       records.


   14. Although the appellant states that it is public knowledge  that  the
       State Bank of Pakistan regulates the banks in Pakistan that was  not
       in direct evidence. Even if the State Bank regulates  some  or  even
       all of the banks in Pakistan that is very different  to  having  the
       role of investigating and regulating  individual  accounts  held  at
       another bank.

   15. Complaint was made that the judge had placed too great a reliance on
       an assertion that there is a high level of corruption in Pakistan in
       Banks. Although the judge makes reference to levels of corruption he
       does not conclude that the documents produced by the  appellant  are
       false because of that; when read properly he is merely stating  that
       there are high levels of corruption, a matter that is in the  public
       domain.


   16. Taking all of the evidence before the judge it was open to the judge
       to reach the conclusions and make the findings  he  did,  doing  the
       best he could with the evidence before him and bearing in  mind  the
       burden and standard of proof. It was not irrational for the judge to
       find that the later evidence did not establish  that  the  appellant
       had held the account as he claimed for the period claimed.

   17. In so far as Article 8 is concerned, the findings of  the  judge  as
       regards the proportionality of the decision flow from  his  findings
       and it was plainly open to him to reach the decision he did.


          Conclusions:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision is  set
    aside to be remade.

     I do not set aside the decision

                                    Date 7th March 2014
Judge of the Upper Tribunal Coker
