Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms Cleghorn, Counsel, instructed by Halliday Reeves
                    Law Firm
For the Respondent:    Mr Diwnycz, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

        1. The Appellant, a citizen of Iraq,  entered  the  United  Kingdom
           illegally in February 2015 and made  a  protection  claim.  That
           claim was refused, and his  appeal  against  that  decision  was
           dismissed by determination of First tier Tribunal Judge  Traynor
           [B3-].
        2. The Appellant was granted permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
           Tribunal only in relation to his humanitarian protection claim.
        3. The challenge based upon the humanitarian protection  claim  was
           itself only successful in part. Thus the appeal was remitted  by
           decision of Upper Tribunal Judge Reeds of 29  November  2017  to
           the First tier Tribunal for further hearing of the  humanitarian
           protection claim, in the context that  the  adverse  credibility
           findings were preserved.
        4. The remitted humanitarian protection appeal was then heard,  and
           dismissed by decision of First tier Tribunal Judge Moran  of  20
           March 2018. Permission to appeal that decision  was  refused  by
           the FtT, but was granted by decision  of  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
           Plimmer of 18 September 2018 on the basis that it  was  arguable
           the Judge had erred in making  an  irrational  finding  when  he
           concluded that Makhmur was located within the  Erbil  governate,
           yet was located outside the IKR.
        5. No Rule 24 Notice has been lodged in response to  the  grant  of
           permission to appeal. Neither party has applied pursuant to Rule
           15(2A) for permission to rely upon further  evidence.  Thus  the
           matter came before me.


      The hearing
        6. When the appeal was called on for hearing Ms Cleghorn,  who  did
           not appear below, suggested that the appeal should be  adjourned
           to await further country guidance  upon  Iraq.  I  refused  that
           application on the basis that it was  premature;  the  Appellant
           first needed to establish a material error of law in the Judge's
           decision.


      The scope of the challenge
        7. It was common ground that there could be no challenge before  me
           to the adverse  credibility  findings  made  by  Judge  Traynor,
           preserved as they were by the decision of Upper  Tribunal  Judge
           Reeds. No attempt was made before Judge Moran to  re-open  them,
           and he, correctly, took  them  as  his  starting  point  in  his
           assessment of the evidence.
        8. The appeal before Judge Moran, and thus before me, is limited to
           the humanitarian protection ground.
        9. Thus the appeal before Judge Moran had  to  be  approached  (and
           this remains the position) on the basis the  Appellant  had  not
           told the truth about his ability to access  identity  documents,
           shelter, and, financial support through family members in  Iraq.
           Judge Moran concluded (as  he  was  entitled  to  do)  that  the
           Appellant was in contact with his family in Iraq, and  that  his
           family were in  a  position  to  provide  him  with  significant
           financial support, in addition to the funds  he  had  access  to
           through the Respondent should he accept voluntary  removal  from
           the UK [27 & 29].
       10. It was not open to the Judge to  infer  in  those  circumstances
           that the Appellant's return to Iraq was not feasible, and he did
           not do so. Thus he had to engage with any Article 15(c) argument
           that the Appellant faced destitution in the event that he sought
           to relocate from his home area in order to avoid the risks faced
           by civilians in that area from armed conflict.
       11. Equally it was not open to the Judge to infer that the Appellant
           would be returned without identity documents, and again  he  did
           not do so. Thus the appeal had to be approached on the basis the
           Appellant would be removed from the UK to Baghdad airport,  and,
           that prior to departure he would have been  supplied  with,  or,
           would be able to obtain upon arrival at Baghdad airport with the
           identity documents issued by the Iraqi state  to  its  citizens.
           Those documents would include a CSID. The  Judge  accepted  only
           that the Appellant had no identity documents in  his  possession
           currently [28]
       12. The parties accept before me that the Appellant as a Sunni Kurd,
           and an Iraqi citizen, in possession of a CSID  would  either  be
           able to travel overland in safety, or, board an internal  flight
           from Baghdad to the KRG and thus travel there by air in  safety;
           AAH (Iraqi Kurds-internal relocation) Iraq CG [2018]  UKUT  212.
           In turn, following the country guidance  in  AAH,  the  question
           becomes whether it is reasonable  to  expect  the  Appellant  to
           avoid any risk of harm faced by a civilian in his home area, and
           relocate to the KRG, if indeed his home area  lies  outside  the
           KRG, and within a "contested area".
       13. Accordingly, and after the appeal had been stood down  to  allow
           for reflection, the Appellant's case was  advanced  as  follows.
           The Appellant had consistently claimed that his  home  area  was
           Makhmur, and that  this  town  lay  in  the  Nineveh  Governate.
           Whether this town lay in the Nineveh Governate as the  Appellant
           claimed, or in the Erbil Governate as  the  Respondent  claimed,
           the Respondent had conceded at the hearing  that  the  town  lay
           outside the area physically controlled by the IKR that  was  not
           subject  to  armed  conflict.  That  concession  had  not   been
           withdrawn, and as such the town was to be  considered  as  being
           within a "contested area".  Thus  the  Appellant  could  not  be
           expected to return to it, and the Judge had erred in  concluding
           that he could leave the  IKR  in  safety  to  cross  the  border
           overland and travel the short distance to Makhmur [29].




      Makhmur
       14. It is plain from the Judge's decision that some time  was  spent
           by him at the hearing considering the true location of  Makhmur.
           Before me Ms Cleghorn was unable to identify any  map  that  was
           placed before the Judge that reliably  located  Makhmur  in  the
           Nineveh Governate. On the contrary, the only detailed largescale
           map that can be identified on the  Tribunal  file  (MapAction  -
           Erbil Governate - Makhmur District) locates Makhmur in the Erbil
           Governate, as of course did the Human  Rights  Watch  Report  of
           2015. That material was before the Judge in evidence, and it  is
           clear from his decision that he felt able to  place  significant
           weight upon both as reliably sourced.
       15. Thus it was well open to the Judge  to  reject  the  Appellant's
           claim that Makhmur lay in  the  Ninenveh  Governate,  which  was
           corroborated only by material accessed  by  the  Appellant  from
           Wikipedia; a source upon which the Judge felt  unable  to  place
           significant weight. That conclusion was well open to  him  since
           this material was inconsistent with the material available  from
           reliable  objective  sources,  particularly  given  the   damage
           occasioned to the Appellant's credibility [24-5]. The  Appellant
           has singularly failed to establish that the Judge overlooked any
           relevant evidence in making that finding, that it was a  finding
           that was not open to him, or, that it was inadequately reasoned.
       16. Although in those circumstance it might seem surprising that the
           Respondent was prepared to make a concession  that  Makhmur  lay
           outside the IKR, I am satisfied that the area  physically  under
           the control of the IKR authorities at any material time, and the
           precise southern border of the  Erbil  Governate  as  originally
           drawn, are not necessarily going to  be  identical  at  a  given
           date. It must be obvious that borders can be fluid in  times  of
           conflict, particularly when strategic positions  and  defensible
           locations have to be identified and maintained.
       17. Mr Diwnycz has been able to show from a largescale map  accessed
           at https://iraq.liveuamap.com that a relatively  narrow  section
           of the south of  the  Erbil  Governate  lies  outside  the  area
           currently physically controlled by the IKR authorities, and that
           this includes the town of Makhmur. Indeed the "front line"  lies
           within 500m of the town boundary. This, or a  similar  map,  was
           the basis for the concession made by  the  Respondent,  and  the
           reason Mr Diwnycz states that it was correctly made.
       18. In the circumstances, and notwithstanding the terms in which the
           grounds of appeal were drafted, and  permission  to  appeal  was
           granted, the Judge's acceptance of the  Respondent's  concession
           was not inconsistent with his finding that  Makhmur  lay  within
           the Erbil Governate. Nor was it unreasoned. Nor was it perverse.
           The Judge's finding was based upon a concession  of  fact,  that
           itself was properly made. It was perfectly adequately  reasoned.
           Where the Judge did err,  however,  was  in  failing  to  follow
           through that finding, so that he failed to conclude that it must
           follow that Makhmur lay for the purposes of  the  Article  15(c)
           appeal before him, in a contested area.
       19. Indeed  after  standing  the  appeal  down  to  allow  time  for
           reflection or instructions, Ms Cleghorn was  content  to  accept
           for the purposes of this hearing that the map  accessed  through
           https://iraq.liveuamap.com is accurate. Thus  the  parties  were
           agreed before me for the purposes of the hearing of this  appeal
           that Makhmur does lie within the Erbil Governate,  but  that  at
           the date of the hearing before Judge Moran it  lay  outside  the
           area controlled by the IKR authorities, and it should  therefore
           have been considered to lie within a "contested  area"  for  the
           purposes of the humanitarian protection appeal.


      Conclusions
       20. There is no error of law disclosed in the finding  Makhmur  lies
           within the Erbil Governate, and not the  Nineveh  Governate,  as
           the Appellant had claimed.  Nor  in  the  finding  that  Makhmur
           currently lies outside the area under the  control  of  the  IKR
           authorities.
       21.  The  humanitarian  protection  appeal  had  to  be   approached
           therefore on the basis that Makhmur did lie within a  "contested
           area", and that since it was the Appellant's home area, he could
           not be expected to return to it. To the extent  that  the  Judge
           failed to do so [30], he erred. However,  as  explained  at  the
           hearing, I am not satisfied that such an error gave  rise  to  a
           material error of law, requiring his  decision  to  dismiss  the
           humanitarian protection appeal to be set aside and remade.
       22. It is plain from the unchallenged  findings  of  fact  that  the
           Appellant can be removed from  the  UK  to  Baghdad  airport  in
           safety, and that he can  then  travel  onwards  to  the  IKR  in
           safety, and with the identity  documents  that  his  family  can
           supply to him either upon arrival in Baghdad, or in  advance  of
           his departure from the UK.
       23. I can identify no reason why the Appellant, as a former resident
           of Makhmur, a town within the  Erbil  Governate,  would  not  be
           treated as a returning resident of the IKR. Even  if  that  were
           not the case, it would be immaterial, because as a Sunni Kurd he
           would be permitted to enter the IKR. He has not established that
           he would face any risk of harm during any security screening. He
           would face no sponsorship requirements, and  would  be  able  to
           show that he had been living in the UK since February 2015; AAH.


       24. The guidance in AAH is that an individual  would  be  physically
           unable to gain access to a refugee camp in the KRG because  they
           are all oversubscribed, and  that  relocation  would  be  unduly
           harsh if there was a  real  risk  that  he  would  therefore  be
           required to resort to the lower end of the spectrum of "critical
           shelter arrangements" [AAH #127].  Thus  the  question  for  the
           Tribunal becomes one of whether the Appellant would be  able  to
           support himself and find accommodation within the private rental
           sector from a combination of his own earnings, the  VRS  support
           package, the support available from the Iraqi  authorities,  and
           any financial support available from his uncle [AAH #128].
       25. The reasons offered for  the  Appellant's  inability  to  secure
           employment were; (i)  his  lack  of  employment  experience  and
           skills, (ii) the unemployment rate for IDPs  in  the  KRG,  and,
           (iii) the lack of  family  contacts  to  provide  patronage  and
           introductions.
       26. As to (i). There is no obvious reason to accept the  Appellant's
           denial of employment experience and skills at face  value  given
           the damage to his credibility. However, even if that  aspect  of
           his claim were true, he is a fit and healthy young man  with  an
           earning capacity.
       27. As to (ii). The guidance to be found in AAH is that unemployment
           amongst IDPs within the KRG is 70%, in contrast to a rate of 20%
           for other residents of the KRG.  However that unemployment  rate
           of 70% includes women who face serious gender discrimination  in
           their attempts to find employment, and, all those IDPS  who  are
           undocumented and thus unable to  take  employment  legitimately.
           The Appellant would not face that gender bias, and he  would  be
           able to take legitimate employment because he would hold a CSID,
           and he would be able to rely upon the assistance  of  family  to
           gain employment through nepotism.
       28. As to (iii), the Tribunal has rejected as untrue the Appellant's
           denials of contact  with  his  family,  and  he  has  failed  to
           establish that he is without even distant family within the  KRG
           to help him obtain employment through nepotism. On the  contrary
           the Appellant's circumstances have to be assessed on  the  basis
           that he would have available to him significant support from his
           family, and there is the guidance that as a  voluntary  returnee
           he would be able to access a support package worth �1500 through
           the VRS. He cannot be heard to  say  that  he  would  refuse  to
           return voluntarily, and thus be unable to access this.
       29. Indeed given the rejection of the Appellant's evidence about his
           family, it is not possible to do anything  other  than  conclude
           that he has failed to demonstrate even  on  the  applicable  low
           standard of proof that he has no family members  living  in  the
           area  that  is  currently  within  the  control   of   the   IKR
           authorities, and thus has no opportunity to access  the  shelter
           and support in finding employment that he could  expect  through
           cultural norms; AAH. There is no sound evidential basis  for  an
           inference that the Appellant would be forced into living  in  an
           IDP camp, or, a "critical shelter arrangement".  Equally as  one
           with a CSID and thus able to  take  legitimate  employment,  and
           with the support of family, and the financial support  available
           to him from the Respondent, there is no sound  evidential  basis
           for an inference that the Appellant would be unable  to  support
           himself.
       30. Looking at the evidence in the round I am  satisfied  that  this
           Appellant would be able to secure employment in the KRG within a
           reasonable period of arrival. I am not satisfied that relocation
           to the KRG would place him in circumstances of destitution. Thus
           the expectation that he relocate to the KRG is not unduly  harsh
           within the AAH guidance.
       31. Accordingly, and notwithstanding the terms in  which  permission
           to appeal was granted, the grounds fail to disclose any material
           error of law in the approach taken by the Judge  to  the  appeal
           that requires his decision to be set aside and remade.



   DECISION


   The Determination of the First Tier Tribunal which was promulgated on 20
   March 2018 contained no material error of law in the decision to dismiss
   the Appellant's appeal which requires that decision to be set aside  and
   remade, and it is accordingly confirmed.



Direction regarding anonymity - Rule 14 Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)
Rules 2008
      Unless and until the Tribunal  directs  otherwise  the  Appellant  is
        granted anonymity throughout these proceedings. No report of  these
        proceedings  shall  directly  or  indirectly  identify  him.   This
        direction applies both to the  Appellant  and  to  the  Respondent.
        Failure to comply with this direction  could  lead  to  proceedings
        being brought for contempt of court.
