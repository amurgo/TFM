                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


     1. This is an appeal against a determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
        Judge Thorne promulgated on 10 January 2014, following a hearing at
        Nottingham on 21 December 2013, in which the  Judge  dismissed  the
        Appellant's appeal under the Immigration (European  Economic  Area)
        Regulations 2006 (as amended), hereinafter referred to as  the  EEA
        Regulations, and on human rights grounds.


     2. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 10  September  1976.
        On 27 January 2012 he applied for a Residence Card as  confirmation
        of a right to reside in the United Kingdom as the family member  of
        an EEA national, Ms Begum, a Spanish national who it is claimed had
        exercised treaty rights in the UK for a continuous period  of  five
        years in accordance with the 2006 Regulations.


     3. The Appellant advised the First-tier Tribunal that  Ms  Begum  left
        the United Kingdom in April  2011  and  returned  to  Spain.   Such
        rights as she may have acquired can be lost  as  a  result  of  two
        years absence from the UK.  It was said she had been employed  from
        2006 to 2007 although  no  documentary  evidence  was  provided  to
        support such a claim and that she had been self-employed from  2010
        to 2011 which was supported by a letter from AH Accountants stating
        Ms Begum was working self-employed as a lady's dress  designer  and
        that her income in the year April 2010 to 2011 was ï¿½6,860. She  was
        also said to be economically self-sufficient from 2007 although  no
        evidence had been  provided  that  she  had  comprehensive  medical
        insurance cover or that she had adequate funds to  support  herself
        for this period.


     4. The application was refused on  27  June  2013  on  the  basis  the
        Appellant had failed to provide adequate proof that  Ms  Begum  had
        been exercising Treaty rights in the United Kingdom for a period of
        five years.


     5. Having considered the evidence the Judge set out relevant  findings
        from paragraph 27 of the determination. It is not disputed that the
        Appellant entered the United Kingdom on 8 April 2004  and  that  he
        was issued with a Residence Card on 30th January 2007. In paragraph
        31 of the determination the Judge states:


     31.  In order for the appellant to succeed under Regulation 15 (1)  (b)
   of              the  Regulations  he  must  prove  on  the   balance   of
   probabilities that he            resides in the United Kingdom  with  his
   wife in accordance with the           Regulations for a continuous period
   of five years i.e. since 2006 (his            wife having left the UK  in
   2011).


     6. The Judge found that as  the  Appellant  was  only  issued  with  a
        Residence Card in 2007 he cannot have resided in the United Kingdom
        in accordance with the  Regulations  for  a  continuous  five  year
        period since 2006.


     7. At paragraph 33 the Judge provides an analysis in  the  alternative
        in which he concludes that the Appellant has failed to prove on the
        balance of probabilities that his wife was exercising Treaty rights
        in the UK for a continuous five-year period since 2006  [33].   The
        Judge found there was insufficient evidence to  prove  that  treaty
        rights had been exercised for a continuous  period  of  five  years
        during this period.


     8. In paragraph 35 the Judge  notes  an  argument  advanced  that  the
        Respondent had been unfair in not providing Ms Begum's HMRC records
        but concluded that the argument has no merit on the basis there was
        no reason to conclude that the Secretary of  State  had  not  acted
        fairly and because the HMRC documents would not be likely  to  show
        that Ms Begum had comprehensive medical insurance.


     9. In paragraph 37 the Judge states "in addition (and most  tellingly)
        the appellant gave evidence that he has never  in  fact  asked  his
        wife to provide any documentary evidence about these matters".


    10. Having dismissed the appeal under the  EEA  Regulations  the  Judge
        considered the Article 8 claim and  found  the  Appellant  did  not
        qualify under Appendix FM or paragraph 276ADE and  therefore  could
        not succeed under the Rules. The Judge then went on to undertake  a
        free standing Article 8 assessment at the end of which he concluded
        that any breach was not so serious so as to amount to a breach of a
        fundamental right under Article 8; leading to the dismissal of  the
        appeal on this ground too.




Grounds and submissions



    11. The written grounds upon which permission to appeal is sought refer
        to section 40 UK Borders Act  2007  and  the  fact  the  Judge  was
        invited to make a direction under section 40 at the appeal  hearing
        on 24th December 2013  both  as  a  preliminary  issue  and  during
        submissions.   It is asserted the Judge made an  error  in  finding
        that such a direction to  disclose  material  had  to  be  made  in
        writing prior to the hearing and the determination is  said  to  be
        silent on whether the Judge exercised his mind  to  the  merits  of
        ordering HMRC to disclose  material  relating  to  the  Appellant's
        wife.


    12. It is also asserted the Judge has erred in his claim that the  five
        years continuous  residence  period  started  in  2006/7  when  the
        Appellant was issued with a residence card,  such  being  wrong  in
        law.  It is submitted the relevant period during  which  the  Judge
        should have made this assessment  was  from  April  2004  when  the
        Appellant entered the United Kingdom and April 2011 when  she  left
        to return to Spain, a period of 7 years. The Appellant's  assertion
        that he had therefore lived in the United  Kingdom  for  more  than
        five years, during which time he has been a family member of an EEA
        national, meant it was necessary to consider whether the  Appellant
        had retained rights residence which had been overlooked  completely
        in  the  determination  pursuant  to  Regulation  10  of  the  2006
        Regulations.


    13. The final allegation is that the Judge failed to apply the required
        degree of anxious scrutiny.



Error of law


    14. The Upper Tribunal was advised by Miss Dhaliwal that the Judge  was
        asked to  hear  as  a  preliminary  issue  an  application  that  a
        direction is made pursuant to section 40 for the Secretary of State
        to disclose the HMRC records of the  Appellant's  wife.   There  is
        evidence of correspondence between the Appellant's  representatives
        and the Secretary of State seeking  information  and  the  eventual
        response, dated prior to the date of the First-tier  hearing,  from
        the Respondent making it clear that the requested information would
        not be made available on a voluntary basis.  Notwithstanding  this,
        it  appears  no  formal  application  was  made  for  the  relevant
        direction until the hearing.


    15. Miss Dhaliwal confirmed the Judge  decided  to  hear  the  evidence
        before making a  decision.  The  issue  was  also  referred  to  in
        submissions and it appears no indication was given by the Judge  at
        the hearing of his decision in relation to the same. Although it is
        not necessarily a legal error for a Judge not to deal with such  an
        application  immediately  the  party  making  the  application   is
        entitled to know what the eventual decision is. In this case  there
        is no indication that the application was rejected at  the  hearing
        but there is  reference  to  the  issue  in  paragraph  35  of  the
        determination  to  which  I  have  referred  above.   The   Judge's
        conclusion that the HMRC records are unlikely to show that Ms Begum
        had comprehensive medical insurance is a clear finding that such an
        application was not warranted on the facts as  it  would  serve  no
        real purpose.


    16. The importance of this issue is illustrated by the decision of  the
        Court of Appeal  in  Ahmad  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
        Department [2014] EWCA Civ 988, in which it was held that where  an
        EEA citizen resided in the UK but was not economically active,  the
        right of the  EEA  citizen's  spouse  to  permanent  residence  was
        conditional, under Article 7(1) of Directive 2004/38/EC,  upon  the
        EEA citizen holding comprehensive sickness  insurance  cover.  That
        condition had to be  strictly  complied  with,  and  could  not  be
        satisfied by the EEA citizen's entitlement to free healthcare under
        the NHS.


    17. In addition to the finding in paragraph 35 it can  be  inferred  by
        the lack of a grant of the application that the Judge did  in  fact
        refuse it.


    18. It is also relevant to note the Appellants own evidence in that  he
        does not  claim  his  wife  worked  before  2006  and  so  was  not
        exercising treaty rights prior to this time.  There may,  in  fact,
        not be any error if the reference to  2006  was  to  the  time  the
        Appellant claimed his wife was working and exercising treaty rights
        rather than the only period for which such an assessment  could  be
        made by counting back from 2011 when she left the UK.


    19. In Amos v Secretary of State for the Home Department; Theophilus  v
        Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2011]  EWCA  Civ  552
        (and see  in this respect  Ziolkowski  and  others  v  Land  Berlin
        (Cases C-424/10 and C-425/10) CJEU (Grand Chamber))  the  Court  of
        Appeal held that a divorced spouse had to establish that he or  she
        had  the  right  of  residence   before   the   question   whether,
        notwithstanding the divorce, the right had been retained by Article
        13 of the Citizens Directive could be  determined.  The  right  was
        subject to Articles 16(2) or 18  of  the  Citizens  Directive.  The
        former provision applied to family members  of  EEA  nationals  who
        must have resided with the EEA national in the  host  Member  State
        legally for a continuous period of five years. The  word  "legally"
        had to be given a Community meaning, which essentially depended  on
        the exercise of Treaty rights.  The requirements  of  the  Citizens
        Directive applicable to the Claimants were that at all times  while
        residing in the UK until their divorce  the  spouse  had  to  be  a
        worker or self-employed (or otherwise satisfied Article 7(1) of the
        Citizens Directive); the marriage had to have lasted at least three
        years, including one year in the UK, and they had to show that they
        were workers, self-employed or otherwise satisfied the  penultimate
        paragraph of Article 13(2). The 2006  Regulations  were  consistent
        with those provisions. Provided that the conditions  in  regulation
        10(5) continued to  be  satisfied,  after  five  years'  continuous
        residence in the UK, a non-EEA national  would  be  entitled  to  a
        permanent right of residence under regulation 15(1)(f) (paras 29  -
        31). Under regulation 10 of the 2006 Regulations, the ex-spouse  of
        an EEA national continues to enjoy a right of residence if  he  was
        residing in the UK in accordance  with  the  Regulations  when  the
        marriage was terminated  (i.e.  the  decree  of  divorce  was  made
        absolute), and the marriage had lasted for three  years,  at  least
        one of which was spent by both parties in the UK.  This  'retained'
        right of residence may lead to a permanent right of residence under
        regulation 15(1)(f)  if  he  clocks  up  a  total  of  five  years'
        residence.


    20. The Court  of  Appeal  also  found  that  the  EEA  national  must,
        therefore, have been exercising Treaty rights up to the date of the
        divorce, but thereafter that is not required.  What is required  is
        that, after the divorce, the non-EEA national  former  spouse  must
        himself exercise 'Treaty rights', in the sense of being a worker or
        self-employed or self-sufficient.  That is set out at Article 13 of
        the Citizens Directive, and is reproduced at  regulation  10(6)  of
        the 2006 Regulations.  If the 'third country national' continues to
        do that up to the five-year point, he will  have  "resided  in  the
        United Kingdom in accordance with these Regulations" and will  have
        acquired a permanent right of residence under regulation  15(1)(f).
        That satisfies the  requirement  at  Article  18  of  the  Citizens
        Directive to have been "residing  legally  for  a  period  of  five
        consecutive years in the host Member State", in order to  transform
        a retained right of residence into a right of permanent  residence.
        But it must still be shown that the EEA national  was  working,  or
        otherwise exercising Treaty rights, until the  termination  of  the
        marriage.  If the  couple  separated  acrimoniously  and  have  not
        stayed in touch with each  other,  that  can  be  difficult.   Lord
        Justice Stanley Burnton rejected an argument that, in such a  case,
        the Secretary of State should assist the third country national  to
        obtain the missing information about  the  divorced  EEA  national.
        His Lordship  stressed  the  "essentially  adversarial"  nature  of
        immigration appeals, as opposed  to  the  inquisitorial  nature  of
        welfare benefits adjudication.  Even in a benefits case, there  was
        no authority for the contention that the department concerned had a
        duty to obtain information from other government departments.  Just
        so, in a case under the EEA Regulations, the Home Office could  not
        be expected to ask HM Revenue & Customs or the Department for  Work
        and Pensions whether the EEA national  was  working  or  was  self-
        employed.  His Lordship does allude, however, to the possibility of
        the non-EEA national former  spouse  asking  the  Tribunal,  on  an
        appeal against the refusal of a permanent residence card, to  issue
        a witness summons for the attendance of the EEA national under rule
        50 of the Procedure Rules 2005.  This is  a  power  which  is  very
        rarely exercised, but there is no reason why it should not be in  a
        case such as this.  Tim Eicke QC also mentioned the possibility  of
        seeking a direction under rule 45 for the  Secretary  of  State  to
        provide any information necessary  for  the  determination  of  the
        appeal.  But  as  the  Home  Office  cannot  be  forced  to  obtain
        information from other government  departments,  such  a  direction
        would only yield the information which the Home Office  happens  to
        have itself, and there  might  be  nothing  at  all  on  the  unco-
        operative former spouse.


    21. The above judgment  highlights  the  comparatively  disadvantageous
        position of the third country national who is  separated,  but  not
        divorced, from a Union citizen although thanks to the  decision  in
        Diatta v Land Berlin, such an individual can  acquire  a  permanent
        right of residence under regulation 15(1)(b) if his or  her  spouse
        keeps on working in the UK during  the  requisite  period  of  five
        years, without having to reside with him  -  see  also  PM  (EEA  -
        spouse - "residing with") Turkey [2011] UKUT 89 (IAC).


    22. The problem of many, including Mr Akther, is that if the EEA spouse
        stops  working,  or  it  cannot  be  proved  that  they  have  been
        exercising Treaty rights, the third country national's five  years'
        residence will not lead to a permanent right of residence, even  if
        the have been working themselves.


    23. In this case the Appellant and  his  wife  are  separated  but  not
        divorced. The Appellants own material suggests his wife worked from
        2006-2007 but not before but the Judge noted  this  claim  was  not
        supported by any evidence.  Even if this was proved to be so, there
        is insufficient evidence to prove Ms Begum  was  economically  self
        sufficient and was able to meet the requirements of the Regulations
        from 2007 to 2010 or that she was engaged with the labour market at
        that time. The period 2010- 2011, even if accepted as  proved,  was
        only a period of one year indicating two years engagement with  the
        labour market exercising treaty rights.


    24. On the available evidence the finding the Appellant had not  proved
        he was able to meet  the  requirements  of  the  Regulations  is  a
        sustainable finding and not one shown to be infected by  procedural
        of any other form of material legal error.


    25. Even if the Appellant entered the UK as a spouse  of  Ms  Begum  in
        2004 there is still a need to prove she exercised treaty rights for
        the relevant period which has not been forthcoming. The grant of  a
        residence card to the Appellant as  recognition  of  his  right  to
        reside as a spouse of an EEA national in 2007  reflects  the  claim
        his wife was working at this time, but not more.


    26. The assertion the Judge failed to  apply  the  required  degree  of
        anxious scrutiny to the evidence is not made out on the facts.


    27. The finding in relation to Article 8  has  not  been  shown  to  be
        infected by arguable legal error either and is sustainable  on  the
        facts.

Decision

    28. There is no material  error  of  law  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal
        Judge's decision. The determination shall stand.


   Anonymity.


    29. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005. I make no such direction pursuant to rule 14 of the  Tribunal
        Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
