                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS









      Introduction


      1.    The Appellant appealed with permission granted by Upper Tribunal
           Judge Rintoul on 8  September  2017  against  the  decision  and
           reasons of First-tier Tribunal Judge E B Grant who had dismissed
           the  Appellant's  protection  and  human  rights  appeal.    The
           decision and reasons was promulgated on 6 March 2017.


      2.    The Appellant is a national of Sri Lanka, born on [ ]  2000,  of
           Tamil ethnicity, who had claimed asylum on his arrival by air in
           the  United  Kingdom  with  no  documents.    He   was   granted
           Discretionary Leave to Remain as an unaccompanied asylum seeking
           minor in accordance with Home Office policy  until  he  is  17ï¿½.
           His asylum claim was refused on 7 April 2016.


      2.    Judge Grant treated the Appellant as a vulnerable witness and it
           was agreed that the appeal would proceed by way of  submissions.
           The Respondent  had  accepted  that  the  Appellant  had  become
           separated from his family in the final stages of the  civil  war
           which ended on 18 May 2009, and had lived in an IDP  camp  since
           then.  The Appellant was only 7 at that time and  had  taken  no
           part in any LTTE activities nor was he an LTTE  supporter.   The
           judge agreed with the Secretary of State that the Appellant  was
           not at risk on return.   The  judge  did  not  accept  that  the
           Appellant had entirely lost contact with his family.  There was,
           for example, the "uncle" who had raised funds for  his  journey.
           The judge accepted that the Appellant was suffering  from  Post-
           traumatic Stress Disorder but he had chosen to decline treatment
           for fear of  retraumatisation.   He  would  be  able  to  obtain
           adequate mental health care in Sri Lanka.  He did not fall  into
           any of the risk categories explained in  GJ  and  Others  (post-
           civil war: returnees) Sri Lanka CG [2013] UKUT 00319 (IAC).  The
           Appellant would not be returned until he was over 18. The  judge
           thus dismissed the appeal.


      3.    Permission to appeal was refused in the First-tier Tribunal  but
           permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Rintoul
           on  the  renewed  application.   Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Rintoul
           considered that it was arguable that Judge Grant  had  erred  in
           assessing the risk to  the  Appellant  at  the  age  of  18,  in
           speculating that support would be available to him in Sri  Lanka
           and in failing to engage with the Appellant's detention  to  the
           age of 15.


      4.    Standard directions were made  by  the  tribunal.    A  rule  24
           notice was filed by the Respondent,  dated  18  September  2017,
           opposing the onwards appeal.




      Submissions


      5.    Mr Wilding for the Respondent indicated  at  the  start  of  the
           hearing that the Secretary of State was not  in  a  position  to
           defend the decision and reasons, having  reviewed  the  rule  24
           notice.  The material errors of law indicated by Upper  Tribunal
           Judge Rintoul were made out.  There was an absence of  reasoning
           throughout the decision and reasons.  The evidence on which  the
           judge's conclusions had been  reached  had  not  been  recorded.
           Possibly the judge might have been entitled to have reached such
           findings but it was far from clear.  In creating the  impression
           that the judge was considering the position when  the  Appellant
           turned 18 rather than as at the date of the hearing,  the  judge
           fell into material error of law.  There was  no  alternative  to
           the appeal's being reheard in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  before
           another judge.


      6.    Mr Burrett submitted that his appeal succeeded by concession and
           wished to add nothing further.




      Discussion - error of law


      7.    To a significant extent the decision as to whether  there  is  a
           material error of law is taken out of the Upper Tribunal's hands
           when an onwards appeal is conceded by either party.   When  that
           concession  is  made  by  the  Secretary  of  State,  it  is  of
           particular significance, given that the tribunal's  jurisdiction
           is one of public law and that the  Secretary  of  State  retains
           inherent, extra-statutory powers.


      8.    The tribunal must agree with Mr Wilding's submissions.  [18]  of
           the decision and reasons, "In any event the Appellant  will  not
           be removed until he has reached the  age  of  18",  creates  the
           strong impression, no doubt inadvertently, that  the  judge  was
           not looking at the real risk as at the date of the  hearing,  as
           was required: see, e.g., CL (Vietnam) [2008] EWCA Civ  1551  and
           AM (Afghanistan) [2017] EWCA Civ 1123.


      9.    The judge's suspicions about the Appellant's  continuing  family
           links or presence in Sri Lanka, and indeed his claims generally,
           may very well be an  accurate  surmise,  but  unfortunately  the
           judge failed to identify with proper clarity the  evidence  from
           which the adverse findings, in effect a  series  of  inferences,
           were made.  The judge reached no finding about  whether  or  not
           the Appellant had suffered  the  extent  of  the  abuse  he  had
           claimed in Sri Lanka, and what that indicated about future  risk
           to him.  The Respondent had accepted that the Appellant had been
           separated from his family and held in an IDP camp, but  had  not
           conceded the extent  of  what  the  Appellant  had  claimed  had
           happened to him there.  The judge did not sufficiently  evaluate
           the impact (if any) of the fact  that  the  Appellant  had  been
           detained until 2015.  The impression created is that  the  judge
           considered that the Appellant was not credible, but  his  claims
           were insufficiently analysed and  solid  reasons  for  rejecting
           them were not supplied.


      10.   It must also be said that the judge's treatment of  the  current
           country background materials for Sri Lanka was  somewhat  scant:
           for example, the judge suggested that those who  had  mistreated
           the Appellant while he was in detention could and possibly would
           now be prosecuted under the new Sri Lankan government,  but  the
           judge did  not  provide  any  specific  instances  of  effective
           prosecution let  alone  compensation.   Only  four  examples  of
           prosecutions during 2015 were provided at [31]  in  the  reasons
           for  refusal  letter,  which  inspires  limited  confidence   in
           objective terms.  All of these problems regrettably  render  the
           decision and reasons unsafe.


      11.   The tribunal records these matters so that the  next  judge  can
           avoid repeating such errors.  Material errors of law having been
           conceded by the Respondent, the onwards  appeal  is  allowed  to
           that extent.  The appeal  must  be  reheard  in  the  First-tier
           Tribunal.
