                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    Introduction

    1.     The Appellant appealed with  permission  granted  by  First-tier
         Tribunal Judge Grant-Hutchison on 12 May 2015 against the  decision
         of First-tier Tribunal Judge Quinn made in a decision  and  reasons
         promulgated on 15 April 2015  dismissing  the  Appellant's  asylum,
         humanitarian protection and human rights appeals.

    2.     The Appellant is a national of Iran, whose  date  of  birth  was
         given as 27 January 1996.  He had appealed against his removal from
         the United Kingdom.  He stated that he feared  to  return  to  Iran
         because of his actual or imputed political opinion,  following  his
         claimed participation in anti-government demonstrations in 2009.

    3.     When granting permission to appeal,  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
         Grant-Hutchison considered that it was arguable  that  Judge  Quinn
         had made erroneous findings and factual errors, some of which  were
         perhaps of less significance than others.   (There was no challenge
         to the judge's dismissal of the Article 8 ECHR private life claim.)

    4.     The Respondent filed notice under rule 24  indicating  that  the
         appeal was opposed.  Standard directions were made by the  tribunal
         and the appeal was listed for adjudication of whether or not  there
         was a material error of law.

    Submissions

    5.     Mr Hoshi for the Appellant relied  on  the  grounds  of  onwards
         appeal earlier submitted, together with the grant of permission  to
         appeal and his skeleton  argument.   He  submitted  that  the  most
         important errors of law were the assumptions which  the  judge  had
         made, such as the likelihood that the  Appellant  had  or  had  not
         attended demonstrations at the age of 13 and other factual  errors,
         such as the Appellant's mode of travel from Turkey,  and  the  rï¿½le
         played by the Appellant's aunt in the Appellant's  arrival  in  the
         United Kingdom.  The judge had further erred  by  failing  to  make
         findings about the summons.  Generally  the  judge  had  failed  to
         resolve issues in the case.  The decision  and  reasons  could  not
         stand and should be set aside.  The appeal should be reheard before
         another judge.

    6.     Mr Tufan for the Respondent relied on the Respondent's  rule  24
         notice.  He submitted that the decision and  reasons  disclosed  no
         error of law.  The determination as a whole showed that  the  judge
         was well aware of the issues, in an  appeal  with  many  improbable
         elements.  The judge  had  been  careful  to  consider  alternative
         scenarios, as seen in his discussion of the Appellant's travels via
         Turkey, which was a peripheral matter in any event.  The judge  had
         considered the evidence of  the  Appellant's  aunt  properly.   The
         judge had examined the  summons  relied  on  by  the  Appellant  in
         accordance with Tanveer Ahmed* [2002] UKIAT 00439 principles.   Any
         error in the determination was minor and did not warrant its  being
         set aside.

    7.     There was no reply.

    8.     The tribunal reserved its determination, having  indicated  that
         its finding in principle was that no material error of law had been
         shown.

    No material error of law

    9.     The tribunal accepts Mr Tufan's submissions.  In the  tribunal's
         view, the grant of permission to appeal was  excessively  generous.
         As always, the judge's decision and reasons needed to be read as  a
         whole, which it has to be said Mr Hoshi's  grounds  of  appeal  and
         subsequent submissions conspicuously failed to do.  The grounds  of
         onwards appeal were simply a reasons challenge which amounted to no
         more  than  an  extended  disagreement  with  the  judge's   proper
         findings.

    10.    The judge's  decision  and  reasons  were  well  structured  and
         expressed with commendable clarity.  The focus of the decision  was
         the judge's findings, to which the majority  of  his  decision  was
         rightly dedicated.  As will nearly always be the case  with  asylum
         appeals from Iran, the case turned on the Appellant's  credibility,
         as the objective evidence  was  not  in  dispute.   The  judge  was
         required to look at the whole of the Appellant's evidence, and  did
         so taking account of his age: see [33].  The judge was entitled  to
         reflect on the Appellant's claimed route to the United  Kingdom  as
         part of his  story,  and  did  so  taking  account  of  alternative
         possibilities: see [35].  It was open to the judge to find that the
         Appellant's claim that he had been politically active at the age of
         13 was  implausibly  precocious,  but  that  finding  was  securely
         reached on the basis of the evidence as a whole, not merely on  the
         basis of the Appellant's age at the relevant time: see [38],  [40],
         [43] and [49], where separate and sustainable reasons are given.

    11.    The judge reminded himself of Tanveer Ahmed* [2002] UKIAT  00439
         at [22] of his decision, and considered the summons produced by the
         Appellant against the evidence as a whole: see [39], [44] [45]  and
         [46].  The judge's decision to place no weight on the  summons  was
         open to him and was securely reached.

    12.    The grounds of onwards appeal extravagantly claim (see paragraph
         7 of the grounds) that the judge "has treated Mrs  Dana's  evidence
         with great deal of contempt... (sic)".  That tends  to  convey  the
         quality of the grounds.  The tribunal found no support whatever for
         that assertion in the judge's determination, which was scrupulously
         fair and neutrally worded.  His finding at [48] that the  Appellant
         had come to the United Kingdom on an organised trip  and  had  been
         given Mrs Dana's (his aunt's) mobile telephone number was  open  to
         the judge in the light of his logical examination of  the  evidence
         presented.  The tribunal is  far  from  satisfied  that  the  judge
         misunderstood any of the so called facts in the appeal.

    13.     In  the  tribunal's  judgment,  the   multi   layered   adverse
         credibility assessment which the judge reached  was  open  to  him.
         His decision was a comprehensive and thoughtful reflection  on  the
         issues raised in the appeal.  There was no material error  of  law.
         There is no basis for interfering  with  the  judge's  decision  to
         dismiss the Appellant's appeal, which dismissal must stand.

    DECISION

    The tribunal finds that there is  no  material  error  of  law  in  the
    original     decision, which stands unchanged
