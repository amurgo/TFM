                            DECISION AND REASONS


Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  I
make an anonymity order.  Unless the Tribunal or  court  directs  otherwise,
no report of these proceedings or any  form  of  publication  thereof  shall
directly or indirectly identify  the  original  appellant.   This  direction
applies to, amongst others, all parties.  Any failure to  comply  with  this
direction could give rise to contempt of court proceedings.

 1. The appellant in this case is a citizen of Macedonia who is married  to
    a citizen of the Slovak Republic, who is accordingly an EEA citizen.  I
    shall throughout this determination refer to the  appellant's  wife  as
    "the sponsor".  The couple have two children, born respectively in 2009
    and 2011, and I have anonymised this decision, as Upper Tribunal  Judge
    Plimmer did before me, in order to protect the children's privacy.

 2. The appellant applied for a residence permit as the spouse  of  an  EEA
    national exercising treaty rights but his application  was  refused  by
    the respondent.  He appealed against this refusal but  his  appeal  was
    dismissed  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Seelhoff  in   a   decision
    promulgated  on  14  April  2015  following  a  hearing   at   Richmond
    Magistrates' Court on 29 March 2015.  The  appellant  appealed  against
    this decision and was granted permission to appeal  by  Upper  Tribunal
    Judge Reeds and following the grant  of  permission  to  appeal,  Upper
    Tribunal  Judge  Plimmer  found  that  Judge  Seelhoff's  decision  had
    involved the making of an error on a point of law and must  accordingly
    be set aside.  She directed that a new decision would  be  made  at  an
    adjourned  hearing  which  should  be  before  her  but   for   reasons
    unconnected with this case it has been necessary  to  make  a  transfer
    order and accordingly the appeal is now before me.

 3.  The  issue  which  remains  following  Judge  Plimmer's  decision  and
    directions is whether or not the sponsor who is self-employed can truly
    be said to be exercising treaty rights in this country as  she  claims.
    One of the matters which caused Judge Seelhoff to consider that she was
    not was that the economic activity which she was carrying out was  said
    to be "nugatory" because in one particular period of three  months  she
    had only earned about �850.  Judge Plimmer did not consider  that  this
    was a relevant consideration because there was no requirement  to  earn
    what might be called a "significant" income; what was required was that
    she could properly be described as self-employed.   The  appellant  was
    required to provide evidence to demonstrate that the sponsor was indeed
    exercising treaty  rights,  in  that  she  was  carrying  out  economic
    activity in this country.

 4. It is common ground that I have to  consider  the  evidence  as  it  is
    today.  If I am satisfied that as  at  today's  date  the  sponsor  can
    properly be described as self-employed then the appellant  is  entitled
    to a residence card as the husband of an EEA national exercising treaty
    rights in this country.

 5. I heard evidence from the sponsor who relied on a statement  which  she
    had prepared and which is dated twelve days after directions  had  been
    given by Judge Plimmer.  In cross-examination the sponsor was asked why
    she had not produced any further documents covering the period after 14
    December 2015 and she very reasonably replied that she had prepared the
    documentation as soon as she could after the directions had been given.
     Moreover she then produced her book of invoices together with an up-to-
    date bank statement from which it was apparent that in the period since
    the beginning of January until the beginning of March  she  had  earned
    just under �3,000 from the various work she had been doing which  is  a
    combination of cleaning, sewing and also, from time to  time,  painting
    and decorating.

 6. Having heard the sponsor give her evidence and the  answers  which  she
    made to the questions which were very properly put to her on behalf  of
    the respondent, I am in no doubt whatsoever that  she  is  telling  the
    truth.  I only have to be satisfied on the balance of probability but I
    wish to record that I was in fact satisfied to a much  higher  standard
    that her evidence was truthful. I would have so found to  the  criminal
    standard of proof had I been required to do so.  The evidence she  gave
    was entirely consistent with the documents she had provided and it  was
    quite clear to me that she carries out whatever work  she  can  at  the
    same time as bringing up her children and that this is and can truly be
    described as genuine economic activity.   She  very  candidly  accepted
    that even if she was not carrying out any  work,  she  and  her  family
    could probably survive on the income which  her  husband  provides  but
    that is not the test.  The test  is  whether  or  not  she  herself  is
    carrying out economic activity, which she clearly is.

 7. At the hearing before Judge Seelhoff it had been conceded on behalf  of
    the appellant that he was  not  entitled  to  permanent  residence  yet
    because the sponsor, his wife, had not worked during  the  period  just
    after she had had her second child.   I  am  not  persuaded  that  that
    concession needed to be made because it is at least arguable that where
    somebody is self-employed but stops working  for  a  period  consistent
    with the period that a worker would be  entitled  to  be  on  maternity
    leave, it does not follow that that person would lose the status  of  a
    worker within the meaning of the Rules but it is not necessary  for  me
    to form any definitive view  as  to  this  for  the  purposes  of  this
    Decision.  So far as this decision is concerned it is quite clear  that
    the applicant is currently engaged in economic activity and is a worker
    for the purpose of the Rules and  accordingly  that  the  appellant  is
    entitled to a residence card and I so find.

Notice of Decision

The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Seelhoff having been set aside  as
disclosing an error of law, I remake the decision as follows:

The appellant's appeal is allowed under the EEA Regulations.
