                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal brought by  the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department against a decision dated 6 July 2015 in respect of a hearing
    before First-tier Tribunal Judge Harris on 17 June 2015.  The  date  of
    promulgation does not appear on the face of the determination, but this
    is immaterial for present purposes. The appeal relates to a refusal  by
    the Entry Clearance Officer in Islamabad to grant  entry  clearance  in
    relation to the applicant (as I shall refer to her, albeit she  is  the
    respondent to the current appeal)  on  the  basis  that  matters  under
    Appendix FM-SE were not met.

2.   The appeal was determined in favour of the applicant,  largely  on  the
    basis of evidence relating to the minimum income threshold.   What  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge said is this at paragraph 18:

         "It would appear that it was with a view to  considering  paragraph
         D(d) that the [entry clearance e officer] in the notice of decision
         turned to look at P60s of the sponsor submitted  by  the  appellant
         prior to the date of decision.  This includes the P60  relating  to
         2013/2014 indicating a gross salary of �25,569."

3.   The decision continues at paragraph 19:

         "Where I  disagree  with  the  approach  of  the  [entry  clearance
         officer] is that the P60 relating to 2013/2014 indicating  a  gross
         salary of �25,569 could not be taken into  account.   The  document
         was indeed issued after the application was sent but I am satisfied
         that, as it covers the period in the  financial  year  relied  upon
         prior to the date upon which the application was made,  it  can  be
         treated as relevant and taken  into  account  as  genuine  evidence
         supporting that the appellant was receiving on a  weekly  basis  an
         income totalling over the level of �18,600 required."

4.   I have had it drawn to my attention and  I  accept  that  in  a  letter
    dated 16 June 2014 sent by the British High Commission in Islamabad the
    applicant in this  matter  was  expressly  invited  to  submit  further
    documentation regarding the income  threshold  requirement.   In  those
    circumstances, the invitation having been given to submit evidence,  it
    strikes me as improper and contrary to the legitimate expectation which
    that letter engendered for the refusal letter to include a statement to
    the effect that "the P60 for the tax year to April 2014 postdates  your
    visa application so I cannot take it into consideration". Appendix  FM-
    SE contains the following at A(f):

         'Before making a decision under Appendix FM or this  Appendix,  the
         decision-maker may contact the applicant or their representative in
         writing or otherwise to request further information  or  documents.
         The material requested must be received at the address specified in
         the  request  within  a  reasonable  timescale  specified  in   the
         request.'

    It would render this provision entirely meaningless were information to
    be specifically requested and  thereafter  supplied  only  then  to  be
    disregarded by an entry clearance officer on the ground that they  were
    not submitted with the application. That cannot have been the statutory
    intent.

5.   In my assessment the First-tier Tribunal Judge was correct  to  take  a
    view which differed from  that  of  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer.  He
    properly considered the content and effect of the P60 even  though  the
    document was both  generated  and  submitted  after  the  date  of  the
    application, since the supply was at the express behest,  so  it  would
    appear, of the High Commission.

6.   It was properly conceded before me on behalf of the Secretary of  State
    that were  I  to  be  satisfied  that  the  P60  properly  fell  to  be
    considered, then the criteria of paragraph D(d) would be met  and  that
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge could  not  otherwise  be
    impugned.

7.   For the reasons set out above,  I  am  satisfied  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal  Judge  properly  admitted  the   P60   and   took   it   into
    consideration. The weight  to  be  afforded  to  different  matters  of
    admissible evidence are entirely for the judge to determine.  There  is
    therefore no error of law on the part of the First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    in either his reasoning or his conclusion.
