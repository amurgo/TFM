                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:     Mr K Katani, of Katani & Co, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant identifies himself as a citizen of China,  born  on  [  ]
    1991. He says he entered the UK on 18 October 2007. He sought asylum on
    9 November 2015.

 2. The appellant claimed that in 2008 his father borrowed money from  loan
    sharks to expand his shrimp and  eel  farming  business.  In  2010  the
    business was destroyed by typhoon.  His father was unable  to  keep  up
    repayments. As a result, his father and brother were attacked  and  his
    brother was killed. Warrants were publicised  for  the  arrest  of  the
    appellant and his father for the outstanding debt.  If he returned,  he
    would be attacked.

 3. The respondent refused the claim by letter dated 20 April 2016:

         'The claim was incredible.

         �15. The appellant's name would not have been on a warrant for debt
         incurred while he was in the UK. It was also inconsistent  that  he
         would be targeted over the debt but not his brother who still lived
         in China. As he did not know from whom his father had borrowed  the
         money, it was not substantiated that the loan sharks had  influence
         over the state.

         �16. The appellant was unable to give names and dates regarding the
         loan.

         �17. Even if in fear of loan sharks or "snakeheads" (which  he  had
         not directly claimed) he left China legally on his own passport and
         did not face risk on return.

         �19-20. The appellant claimed to have been aware  of  the  problems
         since 2010 but had not claimed until 9  November  2015,  which  was
         adverse to credibility under section 8 of the 2004 Act.

         �23-26. The appellant had not raised  any  concerns  regarding  his
         status as the father of  a  child  born  to  his  Chinese  national
         partner in the UK, but in any event there was not  accepted  to  be
         any risk arising from that situation.

         �27-32. Sufficiency of protection and internal relocation were both
         available.

         �33-59. The claim was rejected with reference also to  humanitarian
         protection, articles 2 and 3 ECHR, family and private life and  out
         of  the   immigration   rules,   exceptional   circumstances,   and
         discretion.'

 4. FtT Judge  Gillespie  dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal  by  decision
    promulgated on 2 December 2016.

 5. The appellant sought permission to appeal to the UT on these grounds:

         '1.      At �37 the judge said that the typhoon must be verifiable.
          This erred by requiring  corroboration;  by  speculating;  and  by
         requiring evidence from someone with "no  specialist  knowledge  of
         how to look for traces of typhoon in China".

         2. At �39, the judge had no rational basis  for  stating  that  the
         death of the appellant's brother and mother "had been faked".

         3. At �41, the judge said that not all Chinese police were  corrupt
         and that the murder of three people in "extracting money  owing  to
         loan sharks must be so threatening to the social order that  in  my
         judgment it is highly unlikely that these events  occurred".   This
         was perverse.

         4. The appellants' partner had an outstanding  appeal.   The  judge
         failed fully to consider article 8.'

 6. The FtT refused permission.  The appellant applied  to  the  UT,  which
    granted permission on 4 April 2017 in these terms:

         '1.      The appellant was  legally  represented.   The  judge  was
         entitled to expect background evidence.

         2. This finding was misrepresented.  The  judge's  main  conclusion
         was that the appellant was not responsible for his father's losses.

           3.       �41  was  "arguably  too  extreme  as  it  stands.   The
         appellant's solicitors must  file  and  serve  whatever  background
         evidence they can ...".

         4. Unarguable.'

 7. The further points which I took from Mr Katani's  submissions  were  as
    follows.  Permission was granted on grounds 1 - 3.  Only ground  4  was
    excluded.  At �41, the judge set up a mental  block.   He  irrationally
    declined to accept that such events could possibly  happen.   That  was
    enough to require a re-hearing.  Evidence was now produced  that  there
    was a typhoon in the South China Sea in July 2010.  Country guidance on
    the power and reach of criminal gangs is outdated.   They  control  the
    machinery of the  state,  which  excludes  internal  relocation.    The
    appellant's position on events claimed and their consequences  was  now
    supported by an expert report by Professor C Bluth who  concluded  that
    in view of objective evidence the appellant's account was plausible and
    he  was  unlikely  to  receive   protection   from   the   authorities.
    Consideration should be given to convening a  further  hearing  with  a
    view to updating country guidance.

 8. The submissions for the respondent were on these lines.  Permission was
    granted on ground 3 only.  In any event, none  of  the  grounds  showed
    legal error.  Although the grant of permission encouraged the appellant
    to look for further evidence, this is an  error  of  law  jurisdiction,
    based on the case put to the FtT, not further materials.   The  adverse
    credibility finding was not based  only  on  the  issue  criticised  at
    ground 3 but on several other issues e.g. �30, 34, 35 and 39.  �36 gave
    a powerful reason, related to the long delay  in  the  claim.  Even  if
    further evidence was admitted it failed to disclose error.  The  expert
    report did not justify rejection of the judge's reasoning.   The  judge
    did not say that no such event could ever possibly occur, but found  it
    highly unlikely.  That was sensible, and consistent with examples cited
    by the expert, where such occurrences were major news items and plainly
    were investigated.  The evidence of a typhoon did not show  any  effect
    on the appellant's home area in Fujian province, 1137  kilometres  away
    from the nearest point shown of the typhoon's  impact.   The  appellant
    made no challenge to the alternative finding on internal relocation  at
    �43-45, adopting �30 of the refusal decision.  That by itself was fatal
    to his case.

 9. I reserved my decision.

10. The grant of permission is plainly restricted to ground 3.

11. In any event, none of grounds 1, 2 and 4 disclose legal error.

12. None of the three errors alleged at ground 1 is substantiated  -  there
    was no  unlawful  requirement  of  corroboration;  the  point  was  not
    speculative, but based on the state of the evidence before  the  judge;
    the appellant was represented, and no specialist skill is  required  to
    trace news reports.

13. The evidence later  advanced  does  not  show  that  the  typhoon  came
    anywhere near the appellant's home area.

14. Even if there was a typhoon which hit his home area, that would not  by
    itself advance the claim very far.

15. Ground 2 takes a point out of context, and is no  more  than  selective
    disagreement.

16. Ground 3 similarly exaggerates the judge's point and takes  it  out  of
    context.  The judge did not erect a mental block or decide the case  on
    that issue only.  He  gave  it  no  more  importance  than  was  within
    rational scope.

17. The respondent was correct in arguing that the point survives  scrutiny
    even in light of the later expert report.

18. The appellant had no viable claim based on family and private life, and
    in any case it was common ground that the claim advanced by his partner
    has now been exhausted.

19. The appellant's grounds and submissions do not show that the making  of
    the decision by the FtT involved the making of any error on a point  of
    law.

20. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

21. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
