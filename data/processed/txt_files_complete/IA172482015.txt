For the Appellant:     -
For the Respondent:    Mr Bates, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Nigeria born in 1983.

    Anonymity Order

 2. There is no reason why the Appellant herself should have  her  identity
    protected. This case does however turn on the presence  in  the  United
    Kingdom of her young child, and due to concerns that this  child  would
    be identifiable should her mother be named, I have made a direction for
    anonymity, having had regard to  Rule  14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 and the Presidential Guidance Note No 1  of
    2013: Anonymity Orders.  I make an order in the following terms:

         "Unless and until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
         Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
         shall directly or indirectly identify her  or  any  member  of  her
         family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
         Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
         direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"

    The Appeal

 3. The Appellant's case before the First-tier Tribunal was that  it  would
    be a disproportionate interference with her Article 8  family  life  if
    she were to be removed to Nigeria. Although there  were  other  factors
    the Appellant relied in particular on her  relationship  with  her  own
    daughter, a British citizen  born  in  2014.   She  submitted  that  in
    assessing s117B (6) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002
    (as  amended)  the  Tribunal  could  not  conclude  that  it  would  be
    reasonable for that child to leave. She submitted that there  were  not
    sufficiently weighty countervailing factors  to  displace  the  child's
    best interests, including the  right  to  enjoy  the  benefits  of  her
    nationality, and the fact that she is an EEA national.

 4. The First-tier Tribunal (Judge Herwald)  noted  the  Appellant's  claim
    that her daughter is a British national, and that a passport  had  been
    produced.  The determination  alludes  to  a  failure  to  produce  DNA
    evidence as to paternity,  although  the  Judge  does  appear  to  have
    accepted, as did the Respondent, that a  British  passport  is  usually
    good evidence of entitlement to British nationality  [at  16(i)].   The
    determination goes on  to  list  a  number  of  countervailing  factors
    against the Appellant. As well as being an illegal entrant she had been
    convicted of possession of a false instrument  and  had  been  sent  to
    prison for 30 days; she had accepted a caution for shoplifting and owed
    the NHS ï¿½3068. These  matters,  found  the  Tribunal,  meant  that  the
    Appellant's case under the Rules  automatically  fell  to  be  rejected
    because she failed to meet the "suitability requirements"  set  out  in
    Appendix FM.  There is no quarrel with  that  finding.  In  respect  of
    Article 8, and whether it would be "reasonable" to expect  the  British
    child to leave the United Kingdom, the determination says this:

         "I accept that the Appellant has a genuine and subsisting  parental
         relationship with [S], but even if she is a  qualifying  child,  it
         would be reasonable to expect her to leave the United Kingdom.  She
         is of Nigerian ethnicity. Her mother is Nigerian. We  do  not  know
         the nationality of the  father  but  she  has  obtained  a  British
         passport. Her mother is going back to  Nigeria.  So  is  her  half-
         sister. So will her other half-sister or brother when he or she  is
         born. Both children speak the  lingua  franca  of  Nigeria,  namely
         English. I have no evidence before me as to  whether  or  not  they
         speak their mother's other native tongues"

 5. Through grounds drafted by her previous  representative  the  Appellant
    now complains that this was not an adequate assessment  of  whether  it
    was "reasonable" for the child to leave. Although it is agreed that all
    of those matters referred to by the Judge  could  have  been  relevant,
    they were not  the  only  or  most  pertinent  factors.   There  is  no
    assessment of the child's private life in the United  Kingdom  and  the
    disruption that will be caused to  that,  no  assessment  of  her  best
    interests, and crucially, no regard to the Respondent's  own  published
    policy on British children. That policy is set out in  the  Immigration
    Directorates' Instructions, 'Family Migration: Appendix FM Section 1.0b
    (Family Life as a Partner or Parent - Ten Year Routes)' at 11.2.3 under
    the heading 'Would it be Reasonable to Expect a British Child to  Leave
    the United Kingdom':

         "Where a decision to refuse the application would require a  parent
         or primary carer to return to a country outside the  EU,  the  case
         must always be assessed on the basis that it would be  unreasonable
         to expect a British citizen child to leave the EU with that  parent
         or primary carer.

         In such cases it will usually be appropriate to grant leave to  the
         parent or primary carer, to enable them to remain in  the  UK  with
         the child, provided  that  there  is  satisfactory  evidence  of  a
         genuine subsisting parental relationship.

         It may, however, be appropriate to refuse to grant leave where  the
         conduct of the parent or primary carer gives rise to considerations
         of such weight  as  to  justify  separation,  if  the  child  could
         otherwise stay with another parent or alternative primary carer  in
         the UK or the EU"

 6. Before me Mr Bates conceded that the failure to take any of  this  into
    account rendered the determination unsafe. He invited  me  to  set  the
    determination aside and to re-make the  decision  in  the  appeal  with
    reference to the policy and all the available evidence.

    My Findings

 7. The policy guidance set out above is consistent with the position taken
    by the  Respondent  in  Sanade  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department  [2012]  UKUT  48  (IAC).   Unless  there  are   significant
    countervailing factors, such as criminality that would engage  part  13
    of the Rules, the clear import of the Respondent's own guidance is that
    it must be unreasonable to expect a British - and therefore European  -
    child to leave  the  EU.  Even  if  such  countervailing  factors  were
    established,  a  claim  could  only  be  defeated,  applying   Zambrano
    principles, where there is another parent or alternative primary  carer
    who could care for the child in the UK.   In  this  case  the  Tribunal
    appeared to accept that the man named as  the  child's  father  on  the
    application has played no role in her life.  He is said to be a Rwandan
    with indefinite leave to  remain  at  the  time  of  her  birth.    The
    Tribunal rejected  the  Appellant's  claim  that  she  was  in  another
    relationship, so the care by a potential stepfather can be  ruled  out.
    There was no evidence of there being any other  suitable  candidate  to
    look after this  very  young  child  in  the  absence  of  her  mother.
    Notwithstanding this -  from  the  Respondent's  position  at  least  -
    unpromising factual matrix, Mr Bates asked me to weigh into the balance
    the countervailing factors. I have done so. I have considered the  fact
    that the Appellant has been sentenced to a term  in  prison,  which  as
    Judge Herwald  rightly  notes,  indicates  that  the  sentencing  judge
    considered it to be a serious offence. She was  subsequently  cautioned
    for shoplifting. I have taken account  of  s117B  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and the fact  that  the  Appellant  has
    been living unlawfully in this country since the day that  she  arrived
    in 2008.  Independent of her daughter, she has no serious  claim  under
    either the Rules or Article 8 itself.  She claims to be reliant on  the
    help of others, and so cannot claim to be financially independent.   It
    is in the public interest that persons who seek  leave  to  remain  are
    financially independent. Although she speaks English, this is a neutral
    factor. Little weight can be attached to her private life since it  was
    all established when she was here unlawfully. I  have  weighed  all  of
    those factors into my assessment. Having done so I am satisfied, having
    regard to the clear terms of the Respondent's policy, that in this case
    it would not be reasonable to remove the Appellant's British, and  thus
    qualifying, child.  It follows, according to  section  117B(6)  of  the
    2002 Act, that it is not in the public interest to remove the Appellant
    herself.




    Decisions

 8. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal  contains  errors  of  law
    such that it should be set aside.

 9. I remake the decision in the appeal as follows:

    'The appeal is allowed on human rights grounds'.

10. There is an order for anonymity.
