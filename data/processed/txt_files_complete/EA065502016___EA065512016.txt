               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr A Kaihiva, Counsel, instructed by M-R Solicitors
(High Road)
For the Respondent:    Ms N Willocks-Briscoe, Home Office Presenting
Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellants, citizens of Pakistan, challenge the decision  of  Judge
    R C Campbell sent on 2 August 2017, dismissing their appeals  for  want
    of jurisdiction.

2.   It is unnecessary to set out the grounds  in  any  detail  because  the
    simple fact is that the decision on which Judge Campbell of the  First-
    tier Tribunal (FtT) relied for finding a want of  jurisdiction  -  Sala
    (EFMs: Right of Appeal) [2016]  UKUT  00411  (IAC)  -  has  since  been
    overturned by the Court of Appeal in Khan v SSHD [2017] EWCA  Civ  1755
    published on 9 November  2017.   As  a  consequence,  Judge  Campbell's
    decision must be set aside for material  error  of  law  and  the  case
    remitted to be heard on the merits by the FtT.

3.   To summarise:

    The decision of FtT Judge Campbell is set aside for material  error  of
         law;

    The case is remitted to the FtT.

No anonymity direction is made.


Signed:                                 Date: 4 October 2018
