                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


     1. On 3rd July 2013 the Upper Tribunal found that First-tier  Tribunal
        Judge Miles had made errors of law in relation to certain of  these
        Appellants in the determination promulgated on 20th March 2013,  in
        which he dismissed the appeals against the refusal of the Secretary
        of State to issue them with a  Residence  Card  in  recognition  of
        their right of permanent residence in the United Kingdom under  the
        provisions of Regulation 7 of the  Immigration  (European  Economic
        Area) Regulations 2006 (as amended) and under Article 8 ECHR.


     2. The issues before this Tribunal are whether Johnson and  Grace  are
        able to succeed under Regulation 7, if the  error  in  relation  to
        Grace is found to be material, and  whether  for  those  Appellants
        unable to succeed under the Regulations, they can under  Article  8
        ECHR based upon their family and/or private life.



Background


     3. All four Appellants are members of the same family unit.  They  are
        all nationals of  Ghana.   Johnson  was  born  on  4th  June  1987,
        Kingsley on 10th December 1988, Godfred on 27th January  1986,  and
        Grace on 27th January 1986 too.


     4. Their father, Alfred Kwaru Ocran, was born on 28th  March  1954  in
        Ghana although he left that country permanently in 1991  and  moved
        to the Netherlands. He lived in the Netherlands  between  1991  and
        2005 and attained Dutch citizenship. When he was made redundant  in
        2005 he came to the United Kingdom to seek work.  He has worked  in
        this country since.


     5. Alfred's evidence in his witness statement dated 17th October 2011,
        is that he supported his family who remained in Ghana as  he  would
        send money with people who he knew were travelling there,  cash  in
        hand.  After living in Holland for some time he wanted  his  family
        to join him so he made arrangements for them  to  come  to  Europe.
        Shortly after arrival in the United Kingdom his family  regularised
        their stay.


     6. The family lived with him sometime after arrival at an  address  in
        Northampton.  Since that time the family have made efforts to  work
        and form their own relationships in  the  United  Kingdom  although
        they see each other regularly.  Alfred  states  that  he  sees  the
        family at weekends and often during weekdays and that  they  are  a
        family orientated group who cook meals and hosts dinners  for  each
        other sometimes, go out for meals as a family as  well  as  on  day
        trips, and maintain telephone contact. They also  regularly  attend
        church.


     7. Alfred refers to the family regularising their stay  in  2005  when
        they were allowed to work or enter education but he  told  them  to
        study and work to make something of their  lives.   He  states  his
        children are, however, still under his direction.   He  claims  the
        decision to refuse the application is a breach of human rights  for
        him and the children as they have nowhere to return  to  in  Ghana,
        they are of the same immediate family, and all are  in  the  United
        Kingdom.  Their friends are here, they have no home in  Ghana,  and
        there is nobody who could maintain and accommodate them  in  Ghana.
        They have an established life in the United Kingdom.


     8. In his statement dated 4th February  2013  [A's  appeal  bundle  B,
        pages 22 to 25] he repeats his claim the family are  all  dependent
        upon him financially and emotionally  to  varying  but  significant
        degrees.


     9. In his recent  witness  statement  dated  18  September  2013  [A's
        bundle, p 123 -127] he repeats the  claim  that  the  children  are
        dependent upon him. He refers to the fact the children were  issued
        with Residence Cards valid from June 2006 to July 2011.  He further
        claims to continually support his children in  the  United  Kingdom
        financially, mentally, and emotionally.  He  claims  that  all  the
        children now live with him at his current address in Luton [8].


    10. Alfred confirms that Godfred and  Kingsley  are  working  and  that
        Johnson is carrying out  voluntary  work  for  WRVS  but  does  not
        received any money. His daughter Grace is not working and  has  not
        worked since 2011.


    11. In his oral evidence he stated that when he left Ghana the children
        went to live with his big sister who is still in Ghana. His  sister
        and an aunt remain in the country although the aunt is 98 years  of
        age.  His sister has no children of her own and lives  in  her  own
        property which is the same house the children  lived  in  when  his
        sister cared for them.


    12. Alfred was asked how he supported the children emotionally when  he
        was in Holland and they were in Ghana and his  answers  related  to
        seeing  them  on  return  for  holidays  and  occasional  telephone
        contact.  He confirmed there is a telephone service run by Vodafone
        and Internet access now available in Ghana.


    13. Other relevant elements of his oral evidence are referred to below.
        Alfred also claimed he will not be able to support his children  if
        returned, there will be no jobs for them in Ghana and that the cost
        of living there is high.


    14. I formed the clear impression that Alfred wants his  children,  all
        of whom are adults, to remain in the  UK  with  him  and  that  his
        evidence was directed toward achieving that aim.



Discussion



    15. Regulation 7 sets out the definition  of  a  "Family  member":  (1)
        Subject to paragraph (2), for the purposes of these Regulations the
        following persons shall be treated as the family members of another
        person  -  (a)  his  spouse  or  his  civil  partner;  (b)   direct
        descendants of his, his spouse or his civil partner who are  -  (i)
        under 21; or (ii) dependants  of  his,  his  spouse  or  his  civil
        partner; (c) dependent direct relatives in his  ascending  line  or
        that of his spouse or his civil partner; (d) a person who is to  be
        treated as the family member of that other person  under  paragraph
        (3).


    16. The claim in this appeal is that the Appellants are  all  dependant
        upon their EU national father.  In  relation  to  what  constitutes
        dependency, in Jia Migrationsverket Case C -1/05 the European Court
        considered  "dependence"  under  Article   1(1)(d)   of   Directive
        73/148/EEC and said this was to be interpreted to the  effect  that
        "dependent on them" meant that members  of  the  family  of  an  EU
        national established in another member state within the meaning  of
        Article 43 of the EC Treaty, needed the material support of that EU
        national, or his or her spouse, in order to  meet  their  essential
        needs in the state of origin of those family members or  the  state
        from which they had come at the time when they applied to join  the
        EU national. The Court said that Article 6(b) of the Directive  was
        to be interpreted as meaning that proof of the  need  for  material
        support might be adduced by any appropriate  means,  while  a  mere
        undertaking by the EU national or his or her spouse to support  the
        family members concerned need not be regarded as  establishing  the
        existence of the family member's situation of real dependence.


    17. In Bigia & Others [2009] EWCA Civ 79, at paragraph 24, Maurice  Kay
        LJ said that where the question of whether  someone  is  a  "family
        member" depends on a test  of  dependency,  that  test  is  as  per
        paragraph 43 of the ECJ's judgement in Jia.  In essence members  of
        the family of a Union citizen needed the material support  of  that
        Union citizen or his or her spouse in order to meet their essential
        needs.


    18. A further issue arises, especially in relation  to  Grace;  of  the
        effect of the fact her dependency is one of choice. In  the  recent
        decision in Lim (EEA -dependency) [2013] UKUT 437 (IAC) it was held
        that subject to there being no abuse of rights,  the  jurisprudence
        of the Court of Justice allows for dependency of choice. Whilst the
        jurisprudence has not to date dealt with dependency  of  choice  in
        the form of choosing not to live  off  savings,  it  has  expressly
        approved dependency of choice in the form of choosing not  take  up
        employment (see Centre Publique d'Aide Social de Courcelles v Lebon
        [1987] ECR 2811 ("Lebon") at [22]) and it may be very difficult  to
        discern any principled basis for differentiating  between  the  two
        different forms of dependency of choice when the test is a question
        of fact and the reasons why there is dependency are irrelevant.


    19. Lim is the not first case to set out such a principle for in  Maria
        Pedro v SSWP [2009] EWCA Civ 1358 the  Court  of  Appeal  confirmed
        that dependency could be of choice  and  did  not  have  to  be  of
        necessity.


    20. The test which I have applied in assessing this question is whether
        the Appellants have discharged the burden of proof upon them to the
        required standard to prove they require the 'material'  support  of
        their father Alfred in order to meet their 'essential' needs.   The
        question of whether they are able to support themselves rather than
        by having to rely on the EU citizen is irrelevant.


    21. In relation to Johnson I do not find that  he  has  discharged  the
        burden of proof upon him to show that he is  able  to  satisfy  the
        legal tests set  out  above  relating  to  dependency  and  he  has
        therefore failed to show he is entitled  to  the  relief  he  seeks
        under the Regulations. I make this finding as a number of  material
        discrepancies arose in the evidence which,  despite  Miss  Akther's
        best efforts in submissions, cannot be overlooked.


    22. I accept Johnson has undertaken voluntary work as his  evidence  is
        corroborated by his father and letters from the WRVS to be found at
        pages 85 to 87 of appeal bundle A.  Johnson's case has always  been
        that as a result  of  the  fact  he  is  unable  to  work  he  only
        undertakes voluntary work for no reward. He is therefore  dependent
        upon his father for all his basic needs.  When  he  gave  his  oral
        evidence, however, the first question asked of him in  evidence  in
        chief was whether the content of his witness statement [A's  bundle
        A, pages 6 to 10] is true. He replied it was.


    23. The WRVS letters indicates that he  commenced  his  voluntary  work
        with them in late spring 2011. I have also had the  opportunity  to
        read the determination written by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Thanki
        promulgated on 7th November 2011 in relation to an  earlier  appeal
        against a similar application and refusal by the Secretary of State
        by these Appellants.  Judge Thanki noted  Johnson's  evidence  [24]
        that he relied upon his father and was dependent on him because  he
        spoke to his father regularly and went to see him frequently.  Each
        time he went his father gave him something like �20  to  cover  his
        travel costs otherwise his father gave him money as and when it was
        needed. He did the same for the other children and gave him regular
        advice about life in general. His father once gave  him  �250  when
        his car required repairs.  Johnson also stated that he had two jobs
        earning between �16,000 and �17,000 per annum.  Judge Thanki found,
        notwithstanding the claim to be dependent upon his father,  Johnson
        was  in  employment,  receiving  help  with  travel  costs  and   a
        substantial gift on one occasion, with there being no evidence that
        he was reliant upon his father to get by in life. It was not  found
        that Johnson had established that he was dependent upon his  father
        as claimed.


    24. It therefore appears that in October 2011 Johnson  was  undertaking
        both voluntary work and in employment.   He now claims in his  oral
        evidence not to be employment, to only  undertake  voluntary  work,
        and to be dependent upon his father for all his needs as a  result.
        This account is contradicted however by paragraph 11 of his witness
        statement the contents of which he confirmed were  true.   In  this
        paragraph he states:




              11. The second reason my application was refused  was  on  the
   basis that the                   Home Office has stated  that  sufficient
   evidence has not been provided to                  show  that  my  father
   financially supports me in the UK.  My siblings and I                 all
   live with our father at 21 at Weatherby Road, Luton.  My father  has  two
          jobs and from his earnings he supports us.  He pays for  the  rent
   of the                  house we live in, food and all our bills. We live
   with him on a rent free                   basis.  My brothers and I  work
   in the UK and we have now only been                working since the SSHD
   gave us permission when acknowledging our                    application.
   The  money  we  earn  is  used  to  buy  some  things  in  addition   but
   not for our basic needs which is  met  by  our  father.   He  has  always
          supported us financially and this has previously been accepted  by
   the                 SSHD.  I will always be grateful to my father for all
   of the support which he                   has shown to me  from  a  young
   age.


    25. Johnson clearly claims to be working and a claim by any witness  at
        the hearing they were not working as they did not  have  permission
        to work I do not find have been substantiated on the evidence.  Two
        of the brothers, whose Regulation 7 appeals failed before the First-
        tier Tribunal, were clearly aware they are able to work.


    26. I accept that bank  statements  provided  by  Johnson  show  little
        income and outgoings, regularly reflect �20 per  month  being  paid
        into that account and not a great deal going out.   I  accept  what
        those documents say on the face of them and  the  claim  by  Alfred
        that he pays the rent.  This evidence in isolation does  not  prove
        dependency to the required degree, however, as  it  is  only  if  a
        clear picture of Johnson's circumstances has been provided that the
        context of those statements can be fully understood. I do not  find
        I am  able  to  put  the  weight  on  this  evidence  and  find  it
        determinative as I was invited to do by Ms Akther.


    27. In addition to the contradiction in the evidence regarding  whether
        he was working or not, further discrepancies arose  when  comparing
        Johnson's oral evidence to that of his  father.   Key  examples  of
        such material discrepancies are as follows:


          i.  Alfred stated Johnson only undertakes voluntary work for which
   he                  received �10 or thereabouts and was not looking for a
   job. He worked               three to four hours a week on average, three
   days a week,  mostly  on                 Monday,  Thursday,  and  Friday.
   Johnson's evidence was that he                 undertook  voluntary  work
   helping in a shop on Saturday.  His only source             of income was
   from  his  father  and  that  he  only  worked   on   Saturdays   for   a
   period of two hours.


          ii. Johnson also claimed that he undertook no other work, did  not
   earn                money, but I have referred to  paragraph  11  of  his
   witness statement                above.


          iii.    When it was put to Johnson in cross-examination that there
   was a material               difference between his account and  that  of
   his father he changed his                 evidence.  He then claimed that
   the hours he works depended upon when              he was required.  Such
   a material change of evidence with the sole intent of            ensuring
   his  evidence  accorded  with  that  of  his  father,  without  plausible
   explanation, further damages his credibility.  The  evidence  raises  the
          question if Alfred is correct and Johnson  does  work  three  days
   during the              week but Johnson claims to only helps at the WRVS
   on Saturdays, where              is he working on the other days?


          iv. Alfred's evidence was that he gives Johnson �20 to put in  his
   bank account            every month to help him.  This is  paid  in  cash
   and the last time such                 payment  was  made  was  the  week
   before the hearing.  I have noted the              copy  bank  statements
   provided by Johnson show a regular monthly  cash              deposit  of
   �20  which  corroborates  this  aspect  of   the   evidence.    Johnson's
   oral evidence, when asked what he receives from his father, was  that  he
     receives �10 - �20 - �5, not a regular amount.  He  confirmed  the  �20
          referred to above but again there is  a  discrepancy  between  the
   claim that              only �20 is paid regularly and the evidence  that
   sums of different amounts             are paid.   I  note  the  claim  by
   Alfred that he  helps  the  children  out  by                giving  them
   additional sums if they are shopping or whenever required,            but
   this explanation was not given in answer  to  the  question  specifically
     put in cross-examination to Johnson at the time.


          v.  I have referred above to the claim made  by  Johnson  in  oral
   evidence that           he could not work as he has no permission to work
   which  is  contradicted             by  paragraph  11  of   his   witness
   statement.


    28. I find there is no clear picture of exactly what Johnson's position
        is and in light of the failure to provide  the  Tribunal  with  all
        relevant evidence there remains considerable  doubt  regarding  his
        claim to be dependent upon his father.


    29. In relation to Grace the finding was that Judge Miles had erred for
        the reasons stated but  that  the  Upper  Tribunal  would  consider
        whether any such error was material once it had had an  opportunity
        to consider all the  evidence.   This  Tribunal  has  now  had  the
        opportunity of hearing from Alfred.  Before  Judge  Thanki  Grace's
        evidence was that she worked as a senior healthcare worker with  an
        income of approximately �27,000 per annum.  She lived away from her
        father in Oxfordshire although she visited him on  a  weekly  basis
        and was assisted with travel and received additional help from  him
        when required.


    30. Grace's evidence in relation to this  appeal  is  that  she  ceased
        working shortly after the previous appeal  had  been  dismissed  by
        Judge Thanki.  The evidence suggests this was in November 2011. She
        remained in Oxford from November 2011 to February 2012 after  which
        she returned to live with her father in Luton.  On 8th May 2012 the
        application giving rise to this appeal was made alleging dependency
        upon her father.


    31.  Grace  continued  studying  and  obtained  her   NVQ   level   III
        qualification in Health and Social Care in December  2011.  She  is
        clearly employable but has not sought employment or  to  return  to
        work since and it is clear from the evidence that  the  reason  she
        has not done so is as a result of the need to  prove  that  she  is
        dependent upon her father, with whom she now lives, for  her  basic
        needs. It is clearly a dependency of choice.


    32. There were some elements of contradiction in her evidence such as:


          i.  Alfred's claims that after ceasing work and between moving  in
   to live with            him in February 2012 she paid her rent in  Oxford
   using her credit card and             Grace's evidence that she used  the
   one-month deposit she had paid on the              accommodation to cover
   the rent for this period.  It must be understood            that Alfred's
   claim  is  that  his  children  are  so  dependent  upon  him   that   he
   knows everything there is to know with regard  to  their  finances.  This
     evidence must be considered in this context.


          ii. Grace claimed she had not resumed work as  she  did  not  have
   permission              but no evidence was adduced to show that she  had
   been denied                  permission to work and it  was  put  to  her
   that, in fact, she had been               granted such  permission.   She
   also confirmed later in  her  evidence  that  she                had  not
   worked  as  she  wanted  to  be  found   to   be   dependent   upon   her
   father.


          iii.    Grace claimed in evidence that she had no money other than
   that which              her father gives her but during  the  hearing  an
   issue arose relating to  an             entry  on  her  bank  statements.
   Notwithstanding  clear  directions  and  an              allegation   her
   solicitors  told  her  to   obtain   such   evidence   from   her   bank,
   Grace failed to provide up-to-date disclosure  of  her  current  account.
          During the course of the hearing it emerged that she had printouts
   of             her Lloyds Bank account on her which she  was  ordered  to
   disclose.  These             record a number of payments  and  references
   to other accounts, including              her credit card, and  contained
   two entries in the following terms:


              10/05/2013   FPI  NYARUGWE J       100.00


              17//05/2013  FPI      NYARUGWE J        100.00


              These are credit entries regarding payments into her  account.
   The claim           she receive no source of income other than that  from
   her father is,  on  the             face  of  it,  contradicted  by  this
   evidence.   Grace's  explanation  is   noted   but              was   not
   persuasive.   Another  difficulty  is  that   the   disclosure   of   the
   statements,  even  those  produced  the  hearing,  is   incomplete.   The
     documents provided cover the period 1st May 2013 to 17th May  2013  and
     from 1st August 2013 to 30th August 2013.  Although the closing balance
              goes from �89.77 over drawn to �184.04 overdrawn  the  failure
   to disclose             the statements from mid-May to the  end  of  July
   makes  it  difficult  to                  ascertain  what  her  financial
   situation was during this period.


          iv. Alfred's evidence was that he gave Grace �50  for  her  credit
   card which he           paid into her bank, the  last  payment  being  in
   August 2013. Grace's                  evidence was that father  pays  �50
   into her credit card account with the last             payment in  August
   2013.  Although the credit card statements record  a              payment
   of �50 per month, corroborating  this  claim,  issues  rose  in  relation
   to the claim it had been paid in August 2013 and Grace also suggested her
              father gave her �75 a month which is not what he said.


    33. Notwithstanding these anomalies it is not claimed by Grace  or  any
        other family member that she is in employment.  Grace in  fact  has
        been direct in her evidence in stating she gave up work and has not
        sought work as she wants to be dependent upon her father  which  is
        relevant for the  purposes  of  this  application.  The  statements
        before and after  May  2013  contained  no  mention  of  additional
        payments of �100 and this is not a case similar to that of  Johnson
        as  Grace  has  made  contradictory  statements  in  her   evidence
        regarding whether she works or not.


    34. I find that the error made in relation to Grace is material and set
        that aspect of the  decision  of  Judge  Miles  aside  too.   I  am
        satisfied that as a result of the action Grace has taken  that  she
        is dependent upon her  father  for  all  her  needs.   It  was  not
        submitted before me that those actions  are  as  a  result  of  any
        deceitful conduct  that  may  be  contrary  to  the  principles  of
        European law, even though she is clearly able to work  and  support
        herself in the United Kingdom.  In light of the case of Lim holding
        that motive is irrelevant I find Grace has established that she  is
        dependent on her father which is a dependency of choice  but  which
        is required  to  meet  her  essential  needs.   I  find  Grace  has
        established that she is a direct descendant of her  father  who  is
        dependent upon him.  Her appeal under Regulation 7  must  therefore
        be allowed.


    35. The second element of the appeal relates  to  the  Article  8  ECHR
        claim for Johnson, Kingsley and Godfred.  I do not need to consider
        this in respect of Grace as her entitlement to remain in the United
        Kingdom arises under European law.


    36. It has not been proved that the remaining Appellants  are  entitled
        to remain in the United Kingdom by virtue of the Immigration  Rules
        or any other provision.


    37. When considering Article 8 issues it is necessary to considered the
        questions set out by Lord Bingham in paragraph 17 of the  judgement
        in the case of Razgar [2004] UKHL 27 are which are:
        (1) Will the proposed  removal  be  an  interference  by  a  public
        authority with the exercise of the applicant's right to respect for
        his private or (as the case may be) family life?
        (2) If so, will such interference have consequences of such gravity
        as potentially to engage the operation of article 8?
               (3) If so, is such interference in accordance with the law?
        (4) If so, is such interference necessary in a  democratic  society
        in the  interests  of  national  security,  public  safety  or  the
        economic well- being of the country, for the prevention of disorder
        or crime, for the protection  of  health  or  morals,  or  for  the
        protection of the rights and freedoms of others?
        (5) If so, is such interference  proportionate  to  the  legitimate
        public    end sought to be achieved?


    38. A lot of evidence was  given  relating  to  the  arrangements  when
        Alfred came to Europe and the children, as they then were, remained
        in Ghana with his sister. I am satisfied that he maintained contact
        with them and that he would visit them  and  there  were  telephone
        calls, but the evidence does not support the claim he met all their
        physical and emotional needs during the time he was in Europe until
        they joined him in the United Kingdom.   The  evidence  was  simply
        insufficient to establish  this  claim  notwithstanding  that  each
        Appellant was cross-examined at length regarding what had  occurred
        whilst they were in Ghana and given ample  opportunity  to  provide
        such evidence.


    39. In CO and NO (Nigeria) UKIAT 00232 (Ockelton)  the  Tribunal  noted
        that there was a distinction to be drawn between family life in the
        colloquial sense and family life  within  the  meaning  of  Article
        8(1).


    40. I accept that family life exists between the  remaining  Appellants
        and their father and Grace but that is not the issue.  The question
        is  whether  family  life  recognised  by  Article  8  exists.  The
        remaining Appellants have had  their  appeals  under  Regulation  7
        based upon allegations  of  dependency  dismissed  although  it  is
        accepted they live in the same household as their father and sister
        at this point in time.   In  relation  to  the  provision  of  some
        material assistance, in JB (India) and Others v ECO [2009] EWCA Civ
        234 the Court of Appeal said that  financial  dependence  "to  some
        extent" on a parent did not demonstrate  the  existence  of  strong
        family ties between adult children and the parent  nor  did  weekly
        telephone calls evidence anything more  than  the  normal  ties  of
        affection between a parent and her adult children.


    41. In  Kugathas v SSHD [2003] INLR 170 the Court of Appeal said  that,
        in order to establish family life, it is  necessary  to  show  that
        there is a real committed  or  effective  support  or  relationship
        between the family members and the normal emotional ties between  a
        mother and an adult son would not, without more, be enough.


    42. In AA v United Kingdom  (Application  no.  8000/08)  ECtHR  (Fourth
        Section) the ECtHR held that  Strasbourg  jurisprudence  tended  to
        suggest that the Applicant, a young  adult  who  resided  with  his
        mother and had not yet founded  a  family  of  his  own,  could  be
        regarded as having "family life" for the purposes of Article  8(1).
        However, it was  not  necessary  to  decide  this.   As  Article  8
        protected the right to establish  and  develop  relationships  with
        other human beings and could embrace  aspects  of  an  individual's
        social identity, it had to be accepted that the totality of  social
        ties between settled migrants and the community in which they  were
        living constituted part of the concept of private life  within  the
        meaning of Article 8. In practice the factors to be  examined  when
        assessing proportionality of the deportation measure were the  same
        regardless of whether family or private life was engaged (paras  46
        - 49).


    43. I find the remaining Appellants have not discharged the  burden  of
        proof  upon  them  to  the  required  standard  to  show  that  the
        relationship they have with their father is one in which the degree
        of dependency,  social  identity,  and  personal  elements  of  the
        relationship go beyond on that of normal adult siblings  and  their
        parent.  I accept Alfred's evidence regarding the feelings  he  has
        for his children and that he wants to be able  to  come  home  from
        work and for them to be there but that is an expression  of  normal
        parental love, perhaps tinged with a wish not to be  alone  at  the
        end of the day and as he grows older.


    44. In any event, as made clear in AA, focusing  too  hard  on  whether
        family life recognised by Article  8  exists  or  not  may  not  be
        necessary as it is clear that the test to be applied is exactly the
        same whether it is family or private life.   It  is  clear  on  the
        evidence that the interaction between these  family  members  means
        they form an important element of their respective  private  lives.
        In addition to that private  life  it  is  clear  there  are  other
        aspects of their private lives outside the family including church,
        voluntary service,  work,  and  friendships  as  evidenced  by  the
        letters of support.


    45. The legitimate aim relied on by the Secretary of State is  that  of
        immigration control based upon the economic  needs  of  the  United
        Kingdom, an aim recently recognised in FK and  OK  Botswana  [2013]
        EWCA  Civ  238  in  which  Sir  Stanley  Burnton  said  that   "The
        maintenance of immigration control is not an aim  that  is  implied
        for the purposes of article 8.2. Its maintenance  is  necessary  in
        order to preserve or to  foster  the  economic  well-being  of  the
        country, in order  to  protect  health  and  morals,  and  for  the
        protection of the rights and freedoms of others. If there  were  no
        immigration control, enormous numbers of persons would be  able  to
        enter this country, and would be entitled to claim social  security
        benefits, the benefits of the National Health Service, to be housed
        (or to compete for housing with  those  in  this  country)  and  to
        compete for employment with  those  already  here.  Their  children
        would be entitled to be educated at  the  taxpayers'  expense...All
        such matters (and I do not suggest that they are the only  matters)
        go to the economic well-being of the country. That the  individuals
        concerned in the  present  case  are  law-abiding  (other  than  in
        respect of immigration controls) does not  detract  from  the  fact
        that the maintenance of a generally applicable  immigration  policy
        is, albeit indirectly, a legitimate aim for the purposes of article
        8".


    46. On behalf of the Appellants it was argued they have an  established
        and settled life in the United Kingdom, nowhere  to  return  to  in
        Ghana, no prospects of  employment  in  an  economy  that  is  more
        expensive than the United Kingdom and in a  situation  where  their
        father will be unable to provide any financial support for them.


    47. I accept that the  Appellants  have  been  in  the  United  Kingdom
        lawfully in the past as recognised by the previous  grant  referred
        to above.  There is no suggestion they  have  been  anything  other
        than law-abiding citizens which I have taken into  account.   There
        is no suggestion in the evidence they have become a burden upon the
        social assistance scheme within the United Kingdom  and,  with  the
        assistance and support of their father, appear to have a good  work
        ethic. There is the fact some  are  prepared  to  manipulate  their
        situation to try and ensure they remain in the United  Kingdom  but
        that may be understandable in all the circumstances.


    48. On behalf of the Secretary of State it was accepted the Appellant's
        form a family unit but it was submitted by Ms Martin that they  are
        all adults with no evidence of any special needs or dependency  who
        have lived most of their lives in Ghana. The  remaining  Appellants
        were educated in  Ghana  and  it  has  not  been  proved  that  any
        transferable skills they have acquired in the United  Kingdom  will
        not be of benefit to them in their home state.


    49. It was also submitted that it is relevant that  they  will  not  be
        returned individually but collectively.  I also note that  although
        they claim to have no support there are relatives living  in  Ghana
        including the aunt with whom they lived  prior  to  coming  to  the
        United Kingdom.  I do  not  accept  the  claim  their  father  will
        abandon them economically  if  they  are  returned  and  find  some
        support will be available at least until they are  able  to  become
        economically independent.  Alfred is a man whose evidence  relating
        to the support he has given to his children and all he has done  to
        try meet their needs is commendable but does not make it  plausible
        he would effectively abandon them at what may be a time of need for
        them.


    50. I accept that returning to Ghana after time in the  United  Kingdom
        and separation from their father and sister and  the  need  to  re-
        adjust to life in another country may cause hardship, but  that  is
        not the required test.  It has not been proved  that  the  cost  of
        living in Ghana is greater than that in the United Kingdom and I do
        not accept that it has been  proved  that  any  hardship  they  may
        suffer is sufficient to engage Article 3 or to  make  the  decision
        disproportionate.


    51. The submission that obtaining employment may be an issue  in  Ghana
        is supported by the Respondent's own Country of Origin  Information
        Report for Ghana which speaks of increased unemployment  for  young
        people in that country, although these  Appellant's  speak  English
        and received an education Alfred paid for in Ghana and it  has  not
        been shown that, notwithstanding the general economic situation  in
        their home state, they will be unable to obtain work or will become
        destitute.


    52. I have considered, as invited, the impact upon the  family  members
        remaining in the United Kingdom in  accordance  with  the  case  of
        Beoku-Betts.  I accept Alfred in particular, who clearly wants  his
        family to remain together, will be distressed at the  thought  they
        will be separated as Grace may be too,  especially  as  Alfred  has
        clearly worked hard for them to be reunited as a family  unit,  but
        it has not been shown that any impact upon him is such that it will
        have  such  grave  consequences  so  as  to   make   the   decision
        disproportionate. It is not the case that Alfred will be  abandoned
        and alone as Grace has succeeded under the Regulations and so  will
        remain in the United Kingdom with him.


    53. Contacts with the church and friendship groups have not been  shown
        to be issues that cannot be replicated or continued in Ghana and so
        any loss of these does not necessarily engage  Article  8.   Alfred
        was asked at length in cross-examination about mobile and  Internet
        connections  in  Ghana  and  confirmed  that  such  services   have
        increased recently and are readily available.


    54. In Konstatinov v The Netherlands (Applic.  16351/03),  reported  in
        June 2007 and which post dated Huang and  Kashmiri  v  SSHD  [2007]
        UKHL 11, the European Court of Human rights  said  that  the  State
        enjoyed a margin of appreciation under Article 8.


    55. It is also settled law that Article 8 does not allow individuals to
        choose the country in which they wish to reside.


    56. The remaining Appellants had  a  right  to  remain  in  the  United
        Kingdom in the past as their  circumstances  met  the  requirements
        laid down in the laws of the European Union which  granted  such  a
        right.  They no longer have a proven right  recognised  in  law  to
        remain under the Regulations and  so  are  reliant  upon  arguments
        relating to their family  and  private  life.  I  accept  that  the
        remaining Appellants have adapted to life  in  the  United  Kingdom
        during the time they have been here and that they want  to  remain.
        They have however only been here for eight years having  spent  the
        majority of their life in Ghana.


    57. I have spent some time considering the Article 8 appeal  with  care
        as its dismissal will, at a family level, cause  distress.   Having
        done so and having weighed up the evidence with the degree of  care
        required in an appeal of this nature, that of anxious  scrutiny,  I
        am satisfied the Secretary of State has discharged  the  burden  of
        proof upon her to the required standard to prove that the  decision
        is proportionate to the legitimate aim relied upon. The appeals  of
        the remaining Appellants under Article 8  ECHR  must  therefore  be
        dismissed.


Decision

    58. I remake the decision as follows.  This  appeal  is  allowed  under
        Regulation 7 in relation to Grace but  dismissed  under  Article  8
        ECHR with regard to the remaining Appellants.




   Anonymity.


    59. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005.


          I make no  such  order  (pursuant  to  rule  14  of  the  Tribunal
   Procedure               (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008)  is  no  application
   was made for anonymity and the        facts do not warrant such an  order
   being made.
