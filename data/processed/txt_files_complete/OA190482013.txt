                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms Pal (Home Office Presenting Officer)
For the Respondent:    No attendance or representation.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. Whereas the original respondent is the appealing party, I shall, in the
    interests of convenience and consistency, replicate the nomenclature of
    the decision at first instance.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Thailand. The appellant applied for entry
    clearance to come to the United Kingdom as a partner on July 26,  2013.
    The  application  was  originally  refused  on  October  14,  2013  but
    following the  decision  of  MM  (Lebanon)  [2014]  EWCA  Civ  985  the
    respondent reviewed the financial element  of  the  application  and  a
    fresh refusal notice was issued dated September 11, 2014.

 3. The appellant appealed that decision on October 30, 2014 under  section
    82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

 4.  The  matter  came  before  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Pacey
    (hereinafter referred to as the "FtTJ") on November 5, 2014  and  in  a
    decision promulgated on November 18, 2014 he  allowed  the  appellant's
    appeal under the Immigration Rules.

 5. The respondent lodged grounds  of  appeal  on  December  1,  2014.  She
    submitted the FtTJ had erred by failing to consider the requirements of
    Appendix FM-SE in circumstances where the appellant could not  properly
    demonstrate that she would satisfy the financial  requirements  of  the
    Rules.

 6. Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Grant granted permission to appeal  on
    January 15, 2015 stating there was an arguable error in  law  based  on
    the grounds.

 7. The appellant did not attend either  r  the  original  hearing  or  the
    hearing listed before me. She had sent  a  letter  explaining  she  was
    unable to attend for "contractual reasons" and because she was  out  of
    the country.

    ERROR OF LAW SUBMISSIONS

 8. Ms Pal relied on the grounds of appeal and argued the  FtTJ  had  erred
    because he had failed to consider  Appendix  FM-SE  and  in  particular
    sections 2 and 13. The sponsor, Luke Blake, had  provided  evidence  of
    two employments but the evidence submitted did not meet the  Rules.  In
    the case of Better Healthcare he was employed on a zero hours  contract
    but had not worked for them between  April  6  and  July  12,  2013  as
    evidence by his payslip dated July 19, 2013 that demonstrated his first
    week's work with  them  was  week  ending  July  19,  2013.  His  other
    employment with Epic International only  commenced,  according  to  his
    contract of employment, on April 16, 2013. He had worked in  April  and
    May 2013 and had earned ï¿½10,500 but since the end of  May  he  had  not
    worked until at least September 2013. She submitted the FtTJ  erred  in
    paragraph [19] as he assumed the appellant could earn a  certain  level
    of salary. The FtTJ also erred by taking into account  bank  statements
    that were submitted after the date of application because  Appendix  FM
    -SE Section D confirms that compliance with Appendix  FM-SE  should  be
    considered at the date of application. I was invited to find  an  error
    in law and to dismiss the appeal.

 9. Having heard Ms Pal's representations I reserved my decision.

    ERROR OF LAW ASSESSMENT AND DISCUSSION

10. This is an appeal against the FtTJ's decision to allow  the  appellant'
    entry clearance. Permission to appeal was given on all  grounds  and  I
    heard legal submissions from Ms Pal  only  because  the  appellant  was
    neither represented by the sponsor nor a legal advisor.

11. The appellant applied in July 2013 for entry clearance but by the  time
    this appeal was listed for an appeal it was November 2014.  This  delay
    was partially caused due to the confusion generated in the case  of  MM
    prior to the Court of Appeal passing judgement on it.

12. In September 2014 the respondent reviewed the application  and  refused
    it because she submitted the Rules were not  met.  The  FtTJ  correctly
    reminded himself that this  was  an  out  of  country  application  and
    consequently he was constrained by  Section  85(5)  of  the  2002  Act.
    However, the FtTJ was also constrained by the provisions of Appendix FM
    and in particular Section D that states-

         "D.      (a) In deciding an application in relation to  which  this
         Appendix states that specified  documents  must  be  provided,  the
         Entry Clearance Officer  or  Secretary  of  State  ("the  decision-
         maker") will consider documents that have been submitted  with  the
         application, and will only consider documents submitted  after  the
         application where sub-paragraph (b) or (e) applies.

             (b) If the applicant:

                  (i)  Has submitted:

                      (aa)   A  sequence  of  documents  and  some  of  the
                      documents in the sequence have been omitted (e.g.  if
                      one bank statement from a series is missing);

                      (bb)  A document in the wrong format (for example, if
                      a letter is not on letterhead paper as specified); or



                      (cc)  A document that is a copy and not  an  original
                      document; or

                      (dd)  A document which does not contain  all  of  the
                      specified information; or

                  (ii) Has not submitted a specified document, the decision-
                  maker may contact the applicant or his  representative  in
                  writing or otherwise, and request the document(s)  or  the
                  correct  version(s).  The  material  requested   must   be
                  received at the address specified in the request within  a
                  reasonable timescale specified in the request.

             (c) The decision-maker will not request documents where he  or
             she does not anticipate that addressing the error or  omission
             referred to in sub-paragraph (b) will lead to a grant  because
             the application will be refused for other reasons.

             (d) If the applicant has submitted:

                  (i)  A document in the wrong format; or

                  (ii) A document  that  is  a  copy  and  not  an  original
                  document, or

                  (iii)      A document that does not  contain  all  of  the
                  specified information,  but  the  missing  information  is
                  verifiable from:

                      (1)   other documents submitted with the application,

                      (2)   the website of the  organisation  which  issued
                      the document, or

                      (3)   the website of the appropriate regulatory body,



                  the application may be  granted  exceptionally,  providing
                  the decision-maker is satisfied that  the  document(s)  is
                  genuine and that the applicant meets  the  requirement  to
                  which the document relates.  The  decision-maker  reserves
                  the right to request the specified original document(s) in
                  the correct format in all cases  where  sub-paragraph  (b)
                  applies, and to refuse applications if  this  material  is
                  not provided as set out in sub-paragraph (b).

             (e) Where the decision-maker is  satisfied  that  there  is  a
             valid reason why a specified document(s) cannot  be  supplied,
             e.g. because it is not issued in a particular country  or  has
             been permanently lost, he or she may exercise  discretion  not
             to apply the requirement for the  document(s)  or  to  request
             alternative  or  additional  information  or  document(s)   be
             submitted by the applicant.

             (f) Before  making  a  decision  under  Appendix  FM  or  this
             Appendix, the decision-maker  may  contact  the  applicant  or
             their  representative  in  writing  or  otherwise  to  request
             further information or documents. The material requested  must
             be received at the address specified in the request  within  a
             reasonable timescale specified in the request."

13. The FtTJ in considering the application should also have had regard  to
    Appendix FM-SE Section 2

         "In  respect  of  salaried  employment  in  the  UK  (except  where
         paragraph 9  applies),  all  of  the  following  evidence  must  be
         provided:

             (a) Payslips covering:

                  (i)  a period of 6 months prior to the date of application
                  if the person has been employed by their current  employer
                  for at least 6 months (and where paragraph 13(b)  of  this
                  Appendix does not apply); or (ii) any period  of  salaried
                  employment in the period of 12 months prior to the date of
                  application if the  person  has  been  employed  by  their
                  current employer for less than 6 months  (or  at  least  6
                  months but the person does not rely on paragraph 13(a)  of
                  this Appendix), or in the financial year(s) relied upon by
                  a self-employed person.

             (b) A letter from the employer(s) who issued the  payslips  at
             paragraph 2(a) confirming:

                  (i)  the person's employment and gross annual salary; (ii)
                  the length of their  employment;  (iii)  the  period  over
                  which they have been or were  paid  the  level  of  salary
                  relied upon in the  application;  and  (iv)  the  type  of
                  employment (permanent, fixed-term contract or agency).

             (c)  Personal  bank  statements  corresponding  to  the   same
             period(s) as the payslips at paragraph 2(a), showing that  the
             salary has been paid into an account in the name of the person
             or in the name of the person and their partner jointly."

14. At the date of application the sponsor appeared to be only working  for
    Epic International. As his employment was for a period of less  than  6
    months the appellant would be  required  to  provide  evidence  of  the
    sponsor's employment over a 12 month period. All she provided from Epic
    International were payslips that  he  worked  in  April  and  May  2013
    despite the suggestion in his employer's letter that  he  worked  shift
    work of either 14 days on and 14 days off or 28 days  on  and  28  days
    off. His income whilst sizeable for two months ceased at the end of May
    and he had only received tax refunds after that date.

15. The FtTJ may have considered his employment with Better  Healthcare  as
    demonstrating he had been employed for longer than six months  but  the
    wage slips show he did not work between April 6, 2013 and the  date  of
    application.

16. Appendix FM-SE Section 13 sets out  how  the  respondent  and  Tribunal
    should calculate gross income. This can be summarised as follows:

         Based on evidence that meets the requirements of this Appendix, and
         can  be  taken  into  account  with  reference  to  the  applicable
         provisions of Appendix FM, gross annual income under paragraphs  E-
         ECP.3.1.,  E-LTRP.3.1.,  E-ECC.2.1.   and   E-LTRC.2.1.   will   be
         calculated in the following ways:

             (a) Where the person is in salaried employment in  the  UK  at
             the date of application, has been employed  by  their  current
             employer for at least 6 months and has  been  paid  throughout
             the period of 6 months prior to the date of application  at  a
             level of gross annual salary which equals or exceeds the level
             relied upon in paragraph 13(a)(i), their gross  annual  income
             will be (where paragraph 13(b) does not apply) the total of:

                  (i)  The level of gross annual salary relied upon  in  the
                  application;

                  (ii) The gross  amount  of  any  specified  non-employment
                  income (other than pension income)  received  by  them  or
                  their partner in the  12  months  prior  to  the  date  of
                  application; and

                  (iii)      The gross annual income from a  UK  or  foreign
                  State pension or a private pension  received  by  them  or
                  their partner.

             (b) Where the person is in salaried employment in  the  UK  at
             the date of application and has been employed by their current
             employer for less than 6 months (or at least 6 months but  the
             person does not rely on paragraph 13(a)), their  gross  annual
             income will be the total of:

                  (i)  The gross annual salary from employment as it was  at
                  the date of application;

                  (ii) The gross  amount  of  any  specified  non-employment
                  income (other than pension income)  received  by  them  or
                  their partner in the  12  months  prior  to  the  date  of
                  application; and

                  (iii)      The gross annual income from a  UK  or  foreign
                  State pension or a private pension  received  by  them  or
                  their partner. In addition, the requirements of  paragraph
                  15 must be met.

17. I am satisfied the FtTJ has erred in his assessment  of  the  financial
    requirements. The relevant dates are a minimum the 6  months  prior  to
    the date of application (July 26, 2013) or up to  12  months  prior  to
    that date.

18. The evidence before the FtTJ relating to the sponsor's employment  with
    Epic International can be found in the  appellant's  bundle.  A  letter
    dated July 25, 2013 referred to his employment commencing in March 2013
    albeit this contradicts the contract that clearly stated his employment
    began on April 16, 2013. However, that letter referred to shift working
    on a rotation basis. The payslips submitted  do  not  support  rotation
    working. His payslip dated May 1, 2013 shows a gross salary  of  ï¿½4,550
    for that month's pay. His payslip dated May 30, 2013 shows a gross  pay
    ï¿½6,012. Between May 30, 2013 and the date of  application  he  did  not
    work for this company.

19. This employment was for less than 6 months so the FtTJ must consider  a
    12 month earning period.

20. Although he was employed by Better Healthcare  since  October  2012  it
    seems he only worked for them until April 5,  2013  and  earned  ï¿½6,398
    during that period. These earning would not meet the ï¿½18,600  threshold
    in any event. However, he did not work for this company until  week  15
    of 2013 which is pay date of July 19,  2013.  He  therefore  could  not
    provide evidence of  income  that  would  satisfy  the  minimum  income
    requirement because the evidence of  employment  does  not  demonstrate
    employment that would generate the required minimum level of income.

21. However, more importantly, he  was  unable  to  produce  evidence  that
    satisfied Appendix FM-SE as set out above.

22. It may well be that since the date of application  and  perhaps  around
    the time of the hearing the sponsor's income was increased but this  is
    irrelevant because the appeal is governed by Section 85(5) of the  2002
    Act. I am also mindful of the fact the FtTJ allowed this  appeal  based
    on evidence not before the respondent and  this  evidence  should  have
    been ignored under Appendix FM-SE Section D unless the appellant  could
    demonstrate an exception applied. This was not done.

23. The Rules are clear and the  appellant  must  demonstrate  the  sponsor
    meets the required income threshold. I am satisfied the FtTJ  erred  in
    paragraph [19] because he assumed he would earn the type of income  set
    out in his contract whereas the reality is  he  was  not  earning  such
    wages. In fact, when he could have been earning such wages he  appeared
    to have been doing no work at all be that  for  Epic  International  or
    Better Healthcare.

24. I therefore allow the respondent's appeal  and  set  aside  the  FtTJ's
    decision.

    DECISION

25. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did disclose an error in law. I
    set aside the original decision and I remake the decision  and  dismiss
    the appeal under the Immigration Rules.

26. Under Rule 14(1) The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (as
    amended)  an  appellant  can  be  granted  anonymity  throughout  these
    proceedings, unless and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise. An
    order was not made in the First-tier and I see no reason to  make  such
    an order here.
