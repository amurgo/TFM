                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is a rehearing of an appeal following a decision which I  made  on
    26 September 2017 that a decision made by the First-tier  Tribunal  had
    contained a material error of law such that  the  decision  had  to  be
    remade.  Much of what is contained within the decision  I  made  as  to
    error of law is repeated within this decision.

 2. The appellant is a national of India who arrived  in  this  country  in
    September 2010 with leave to remain as the dependant of her husband who
    had a Tier 4 visa.  She was  included  as  a  dependent  on  a  Tier  1
    application made by her husband on 27 March 2012 and was granted  leave
    to remain until 31 January 2014.  She  left  the  UK  in  October  2013
    briefly for a holiday and then again left in June 2014,  returning  the
    following month on her own Tier 2 visa.  She is qualified as a  dentist
    in India but came back initially to work  for  a  software  company  in
    which job she was earning about ï¿½30,000 a year, although  at  the  same
    time she was taking steps to obtain the qualification to practise as  a
    dentist in this country.  The appellant had had a child in  July  2013,
    which child is an Indian citizen.  Regrettably and very sadly (and as I
    noted in my earlier decision this is accepted by  the  respondent)  the
    appellant's husband has behaved disgracefully to her and on a number of
    occasions abused her physically.  He has no less than four  convictions
    for domestic violence and had been cautioned twice.  The appellant  had
    also obtained a non-molestation injunction against  him.   He  has  now
    returned to India and it is unlikely he will ever be allowed back  into
    this country.  Currently the appellant's child is in India living  with
    the appellant's parents, but the aim of the appellant if she is allowed
    to remain in this country is to apply for permission  for  her  son  to
    join her here.

 3. In addition to being violent towards the  appellant  her  husband  also
    made threats to her employer, the consequences of  which  is  that  she
    lost her job and the employer ceased being her sponsor.  This  is  also
    accepted by the respondent.  It is  not  clear  whether  the  appellant
    would have been able to bring proceedings in an employment tribunal  in
    respect of the cessation of this job, but that is not  an  issue  which
    has been put before me.  In all events (and this also  is  accepted  on
    behalf of the respondent) entirely because of the  husband's  appalling
    behaviour, instead of being in a position where in the normal course of
    events she would have been able to  remain  lawfully  in  this  country
    until such time as she became entitled to settlement, this is no longer
    the case.  This is  because  her  leave  was  curtailed  following  the
    cessation of the sponsorship of her employer,  although  the  appellant
    has always been in this country with leave, which is a matter to  which
    I will refer below.

 4. Initially it was suggested on the appellant's behalf that she had had a
    "legitimate expectation" that in the fullness  of  time  she  would  be
    granted indefinite leave  to  remain,  but  her  argument  is  not  now
    advanced in these terms.  However, it is still asserted on  her  behalf
    that the circumstances in which her employment ceased,  such  that  she
    would no longer have a  lawful  right  to  remain  unless  this  appeal
    succeeded, was an important factor which adds weight to her  Article  8
    claim to be allowed to remain.

 5. As already noted, because her employer had withdrawn its sponsorship of
    the appellant, the respondent curtailed her leave so that the leave  to
    remain which she had had, which had not been due  to  expire  until  31
    July 2019 (before which she had been hopeful she would have  been  able
    to extend the leave, and there is no reason to suspect that  she  would
    not) was curtailed to expire on 8 September 2015.   Before  that  leave
    expired, that is while the appellant was here lawfully,  the  appellant
    applied for leave to remain on form  FLR(O)  based  on  her  Article  8
    rights.  The application was made on 1 August 2015, and  so  until  her
    appeal rights are exhausted she has 3C leave to remain.  As noted, this
    appellant has never been present in this country without leave, and  it
    is not now suggested on behalf of the respondent that she has.

 6. The appellant's application was refused by the respondent on 15 January
    2016 and the appellant's appeal was  lodged  some  eleven  days  later,
    within time.

 7. After the appeal  had  been  lodged,  but  before  it  was  heard,  the
    appellant had commenced a relationship with Mr W,  a  British  citizen.
    It  is  accordingly  clear  that  at  the  time  she   commenced   this
    relationship, her immigration position could properly be  described  as
    "precarious" (because she knew that unless her  appeal  was  successful
    she would not be allowed to remain) but equally it is also  clear  that
    the relationship was commenced and continued at a time when she was  in
    the country lawfully, as she still is.

 8. The appellant's appeal was  eventually  heard  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Housego, sitting at Harmondsworth, on 26 April  2017,  but  in  a
    Decision and Reasons promulgated a week later, on  3  May  2017,  Judge
    Housego dismissed the appeal.  Although he accepted that the  appellant
    had been truthful with regard to the circumstances in which her husband
    had abused her, he nonetheless decided that the relationship with Mr  W
    "is to be attributed little weight" (see paragraph 68 of his  decision)
    and seemingly also  within  the  same  paragraph  that  her  visa  "had
    expired".

 9. The appellant appealed against this decision and at a hearing before me
    on 26 September 2017 I found that  Judge  Housego's  decision  was  not
    sustainable.  When making this decision, I set out  what  was  said  on
    behalf of the respondent by Mr Jarvis, who was  then  representing  the
    respondent, following discussion during the  hearing.   Mr  Jarvis  had
    stated as follows:

         "I would accept, having heard  the  appellant's  Counsel  make  the
         point, that there was not an engagement [within the decision]  with
         why it is that the appellant's circumstances are precarious,  which
         is the  adverse  actions  of  a  husband,  which  in  general  were
         accepted.

         So in retrospect now, having shifted away the argument, looking  at
         why the relationship was precarious, the judge had not  dealt  with
         the  material  matter  which  could  have  affected  the   outcome.
         Therefore, in terms of how this was played out, the judge has erred
         in the findings on proportionality.

         I accept that this is an unusual  case,  and  the  judge  possibly,
         unfortunately has not engaged with all the factors.  This leads  to
         findings which were made with  regard  to  Article  8  outside  the
         Rules, as unsustainable".

10. As I stated within my decision as to error of law,  I  agreed  with  Mr
    Jarvis that for the reasons he had given the  finding  with  regard  to
    Article 8 outside the Rules was indeed unsustainable but added that the
    judge had also appeared  to  misunderstand  what  was  set  out  within
    Section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, which
    was inserted by Section 19 of the Immigration Act 2014.   At  paragraph
    68, the judge had stated as follows:

         "Taking these [that is the claim to private and family life] one at
         a time, the family life with Mr W does not amount to an  Article  8
         reason to grant her leave.  The relationship was  formed  when  her
         status in the UK was precarious, as he knew.  Her visa had  expired
         and she had applied for leave to  remain  outside  the  Immigration
         Rules.  Accordingly it is to be attributed little weight.  There is
         no right for a British citizen to have immigration status  accorded
         to the person he wishes to marry.  The factors in S117A, B and D of
         the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 that the appellant
         meets are the absence of negative  factors  not  reasons  to  grant
         leave to remain on Article 8 grounds".

11. In fact, as I noted in my decision as  to  error  of  law,  so  far  as
    Section 117B is concerned, it is provided at sub-paragraph (4) that:

         "Little weight should be given to-

         (a)  a private life, or

         (b)  a relationship formed  with  a  qualifying  partner,  that  is
             established by a person at a time when the person  is  in  the
             United Kingdom unlawfully [my emphasis]".

12. As I have already noted, the relationship was formed at a time when the
    appellant was in the UK lawfully, as she has always been.

13. Little weight should be given  (as  provided  within  Section  117B(5))
    where an appellant is relying  on  "private  life"  because  this  sub-
    section states that "Little weight should be given to  a  private  life
    established by a person at a time when the person's immigration  status
    is precarious".

14. There is no specific provision that "little weight" should be given  to
    family life in these circumstances, and of course that is what her life
    with Mr  W  is.   So  although  obviously  it  is  a  factor  that  the
    appellant's immigration status could be said to have  been  precarious,
    and therefore the weight to be attached to the relationship with  Mr  W
    would be less than it otherwise might have been, it is not  right  that
    the Tribunal is obliged to attach "little weight" to this  family  life
    that she has with him.  This is particularly so in the circumstances of
    this case, where the reason why the  appellant's  immigration  position
    was precarious was because of the appalling  treatment  which  she  had
    received at the hands of her husband.

15. It was for these reasons that  I  agreed  with  Mr  Jarvis  that  Judge
    Housego's decision could not be allowed to stand, as it had  been  made
    following an incorrect assessment of the factors and the weight  to  be
    given to them.

16. I accordingly set aside the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and
    directed that the rehearing would be before myself but that before this
    took place the appellant should serve further  evidence  in  particular
    with regard to the financial position of Mr W, which Judge Housego  had
    considered was unsatisfactory at the hearing before him.

17. This evidence was in fact served, although unfortunately I did not  see
    it until the morning of the hearing.  In addition to  this  evidence  I
    was also assisted by a full skeleton argument prepared on behalf of the
    appellant by Ms Murshed, and also by the very fair  approach  taken  to
    this appeal at this hearing by Mr Duffy on behalf of the respondent.

18. Mr Duffy set out  the  respondent's  position  very  clearly  and  very
    fairly.  The respondent did not have any  issues  with  regard  to  the
    credibility either of the appellant or of Mr W.  It was  accepted  that
    as now shown by the P60 evidence submitted on behalf of the  appellant,
    that Mr W earned ï¿½30,000 a year and also that the appellant had savings
    of ï¿½40,000.  She spoke good English obviously and so  far  as  all  the
    neutral factors set out within the new Part V  of  the  2002  Act  were
    concerned, all of these were satisfied.  Mr  Duffy  on  behalf  of  the
    respondent also accepted that although the appellant could not  succeed
    specifically under the Rules, nonetheless she could rely on a number of
    factors which were suggestive of this case being a very  unusual,  even
    exceptional one.  In the first place, economically, this  couple  would
    not be a drain on the British economy, so that point could not be taken
    against the appellant.  Also,  she  had  never  been  in  this  country
    unlawfully.  Furthermore, the  fact  is  that  she  was  here  with  an
    expectation (albeit it was not conceded or indeed put that she had what
    could technically be described as "a legitimate expectation") of  being
    allowed to remain.  Nonetheless, she  would  in  the  usual  course  of
    events probably have been allowed to settle  in  this  country  in  due
    course.  The most important factor in this case was that it was because
    of the actions of her husband  that  her  leave  was  curtailed,  which
    clearly is not a typical factor in cases such as this.  To summarise Mr
    Duffy's position, on the basic facts of this case there  were  numerous
    factors in support of the appellant  being  allowed,  exceptionally  to
    remain.

19. In my judgement, the reasons for allowing this appellant to remain  are
    so compelling that this can truly be said to be one of those rare cases
    where exceptionally leave to remain ought to be allowed under Article 8
    outside the Rules.  In addition to the factors very fairly accepted  on
    behalf of the  respondent  by  Mr  Duffy,  there  are  some  additional
    features in this case which are clear from the evidence which has  been
    put before the Tribunal and which has been accepted on  behalf  of  the
    respondent.  As a matter of  fact,  this  appellant  currently  remains
    married to her ex-husband and so unless and until she obtains a divorce
    she would not be able to apply to return to this country  either  as  a
    wife (clearly, because she  cannot  marry  Mr  W  until  she  has  been
    divorced from her current husband) or even as a fiancï¿½e, because  until
    she is divorced she is not free to marry.  So in this case, if she were
    to return to India, in order to  make  an  application  from  India  to
    return to the UK, that application  might  not  be  possible  for  some
    considerable time.  Also, in order to obtain  a  divorce  she  will  be
    obliged to have personal dealings within India  involving  her  current
    husband, with the attendant risks and trauma this would involve.

20. It is not reasonable, in my judgement, in  the  circumstances  of  this
    case, to expect Mr W, who is settled  here  with  a  good  job  and  is
    economically independent, to accompany the appellant to  India  and  so
    the reality is that the two options are first that the appellant  could
    remain here with Mr W, being no drain on the economy at all but  indeed
    a benefit to the British economy or she could return to  India  at  the
    cost of a disruption in the relationship for  possibly  several  years,
    where she would have the heartache of  being  forced  into  a  position
    where she would have to deal  with  her  divorce  in  India  where  her
    husband was  present  and  where  her  husband  would   have  increased
    opportunities to continue the appalling behaviour towards her which  he
    has shown he was capable of in this country.

21. In my judgement the factors in favour of  allowing  this  appellant  to
    remain in this country now are  so  strong  and  so  compelling  as  to
    outweigh by a considerable margin the reasons why  she  should  not  be
    allowed  to  remain,  which  are  essentially  no  stronger  than  that
    immigration control needs to be enforced.  As in this  case,  there  is
    absolutely nothing untoward about this appellant's immigration  history
    or indeed about any of the requirements  one  would  normally  wish  an
    applicant for settlement eventually to satisfy but very  very  positive
    reasons indeed why the interference with her Article 8 rights would  in
    the circumstances of this case be  severe,  I  have  no  difficulty  in
    finding this case so exceptional that leave should be  granted  outside
    the Rules.

22. It follows that the appellant's appeal must be allowed and  I  will  so
    find.

Decision

I set aside the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Housego as  containing
a material error of law and I remake it as follows:

The appellant's appeal is allowed, on human rights grounds, Article 8.


Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify her  or  any  member  of  her  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
