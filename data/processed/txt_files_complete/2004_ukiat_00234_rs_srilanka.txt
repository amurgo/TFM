                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    The appellant is a citizen of Sri Lanka who has been given permission
      to appeal the determination of  an  Adjudicator,  Mr  J  R  Devittie,
      dismissing on both Refugee Convention and human  rights  grounds  his
      appeal against the respondent's decision to give directions  for  his
      removal from the United Kingdom following the refusal of asylum.

2.    Mr M Murphy of Counsel instructed by Jeya & Co, Solicitors,  appeared
      for the appellant.  The appellant attended the hearing.  Mr A Hutton,
      a Home Office Presenting Officer, represented the respondent.

3.    The appellant arrived in the United Kingdom and claimed asylum on  13
      July 2000.  The notice  containing  the  decision  against  which  he
      appeals is dated 24 November 2000.   The Adjudicator heard the appeal
      on 5 November 2003.    A  Vice  President  of  the  Tribunal  refused
      permission to appeal but, on an  application  for  statutory  review,
      Gage J, reversed this decision.

4.    A preliminary point arose as to the scope of the  grounds  of  appeal
      which Mr Murphy was entitled to argue on behalf of the appellant.

5.    In refusing permission to appeal the Vice President said,

           "The claimant's account is that he cannot return to his  village
           because he collaborated  with  the  authorities  in  2000  while
           detained.  He betrayed secret LTTE locations to the  army  under
           torture.  Even taken at its highest, that claim  does  not  oust
           the possibility of internal flight  to  Colombo.   There  is  no
           evidence that the LTTE are engaging in revenge  killings  there.
           These grounds of appeal do not disclose any error of  law  which
           would have made a material difference  to  the  outcome  of  the
           appeal.  There is no other compelling reason for the  appeal  to
           be heard."


6.    Gage J in reversing this decision gave the following reasons,

      "1.   The application for review is out  of  time  by  a  very  small
           margin.  I extend time.


      2.    The reasons for refusal of  leave  given  by  the  IAT  do  not
           address the main ground of appeal based, as it is, on  the  case
           of Selvaratnam [2003] EWCA Civ 121.   I consider that ground  of
           appeal against the Adjudicator's decision is arguable."


7.    There are four grounds of appeal.  Grounds 1 and 2 relate to risk  on
      return at the hands of the authorities and raise Selvaratnam  points.
      Grounds 3 and 4 relate to risk at the hands of the LTTE and ground  5
      to alleged breaches  of  Articles  3  and  8  in  the  light  of  the
      psychiatric evidence  and  the  allegation  that  the  appellant  was
      receiving ongoing psychological care. Mr Murphy sought to argue  the
      points relating to risk at the hands of the LTTE but made no  mention
      of the fifth ground of appeal.

8.    The application to the Administrative Court for Statutory Review  was
      made under the powers contained in Section 101  of  the  Nationality,
      Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 which provides,

      "(1)  A party to an appeal to an Adjudicator under Section 82  or  83
           may, with the permission of  the  Immigration  Appeal  Tribunal,
           appeal to the Tribunal against the  Adjudicator's  determination
           on a point of law.


      (2)   A party to an application to the  Tribunal  for  permission  to
           appeal under sub-section (1) may apply to the High Court or,  in
           Scotland, to the Court of Session for a review of the Tribunal's
           decision on the ground that the Tribunal made an error of law.


      (3)   Where an application is made under sub-section (2) -


           (a)   it shall be determined by a single judge by reference only
                 to written submissions;


           (b)   the judge may affirm or reverse the Tribunal's decision,


           (c)   the judge's decision shall be final, and


           (d)   if, in an application to the High Court, the judge  thinks
                 the application had no merit he shall issue a  certificate
                 under  this  paragraph  (which  shall  be  dealt  with  in
                 accordance with civil procedure rules).


      (4)   The Lord Chancellor may by order  repeal  sub-section  (2)  and
           (3)."


9.     We  asked  Mr  Murphy  whether  he  was  contending  that,  firstly,
      permission was granted solely on  the  terms  expressed  by  Gage  J;
      secondly, on the terms expressed by Gage J by reference to  and  also
      taking into account the reasons  given  by  the  Vice  President  who
      refused permission to appeal; thirdly, on the basis that Gage  J,  by
      reversing the determination of the Vice President, impliedly  allowed
      all the grounds of appeal to  be  argued  or,  fourthly,  some  other
      construction.   Mr  Murphy  did  not  adopt  the  first   or   fourth
      alternatives but asked us to follow the second or third.   He  argued
      that the second did not rule out grounds 3, 4 and 5, whilst the third
      would allow all the grounds to be argued.

10.   We found and ruled in favour of the  first  position.   We  can  find
      nothing in Section 101, or in any  other  part  of  the  Nationality,
      Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and no other authority has been cited
      which persuades us that the  High  Court  or  the  Court  of  Session
      cannot, when reversing the refusal of permission  to  appeal  by  the
      Tribunal, limit the grounds of  appeal  which  may  be  argued.    We
      concluded that paragraph 2 of the reasons give by Gage J  are  clear;
      only the Selvaratnam based grounds of appeal may be argued.

11.   We also suggested to Mr Murphy that we needed to consider Rule 20  of
      the Immigration and  Asylum  Appeals  (Procedure)  Rules  2003  which
      provides,
      "20 - (1)   A party may vary his grounds  of  appeal  only  with  the
                 permission of the Tribunal.


             (2)  Where the Tribunal has refused permission  to  appeal  on
                 any ground it  must  not  grant  permission  to  vary  the
                 grounds of appeal to include  that  ground  unless  it  is
                 satisfied that, because of special circumstances, it would
                 be unjust not to allow the variation.".


12.   If our interpretation of the reasons given by Gage J is  correct  and
      he did limit the grounds which could be argued then Rule  20(2)  gives
      us no power to vary the grounds of appeal to include a ground which he
      excluded.  The Rule only applies where the Tribunal  rather  than  the
      High Court or the Court of Session have refused permission  to  appeal
      on any ground.

13.   If we are mistaken  and  the  second  alternative  applies  then  the
      reasons given by Gage J need  to  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the
      reasons given by the Vice President and to that extent we  have  power
      to consider a variation of the grounds of appeal under Rule 20(2).  If
      so we conclude there are no special circumstances which would make  it
      unjust not to allow the variation.  Mr Murphy made no attempt to argue
      the fifth ground of appeal  nor,  in  the  light  of  current  country
      conditions, is there any arguable basis on which it could be said that
      the Adjudicator erred in concluding that the appellant would not be at
      risk from the LTTE. Furthermore, as the  Vice  President  who  refused
      permission to appeal stated, he could relocate to Colombo.

14.   As the result of our  ruling  the  representatives  argued  only  the
      Selvaratnam point in relation to risk on return at the  hands  of  the
      authorities.

15.   Selvaratnam was heard by the Court of Appeal in January  2003.    The
      claimant was a Sri Lankan Tamil.  The facts are set out in paragraph 3
      of the judgement.  After being arrested and tortured in 1995 and  1996
      because of suspected association with the LTTE the claimant was  again
      arrested in November 2000.  He was held for two  months  and  tortured
      until he agreed to sign two pieces of  paper  which  he  thought  were
      confessions.  He was detained and forced to work for the army  on  the
      basis that he was involved with the LTTE.  He escaped after about  two
      months in January or February 2001  before  fleeing  the  country  and
      coming to the United Kingdom.   The Adjudicator found that claimant to
      be a credible witness who had  clandestinely  and  unlawfully  escaped
      from the custody of the authorities.  The court found that in allowing
      the Secretary of State's appeal the Tribunal did not  ask  itself  the
      correct questions.  The claimant's appeal was allowed and the order of
      the  Adjudicator  restored.   Whilst  the  judgment   in   Selvaratnam
      establishes that unlawful escape from the custody of  the  authorities
      in Sri Lanka is a factor which needs to be taken into account, we must
      do so in the light of the country information as it is now rather than
      as it was when Selvaratnam was heard.  We must also take into  account
      the  particular  and  inevitably  different  circumstances   of   this
      appellant.  The Adjudicator believed him and the facts of the case are
      set out in paragraph 2 of the determination in the following terms,

      "(a)  In 1990 the army accused his brother of assisting the LTTE  and
           they shot him.  After that the army  became  suspicious  of  his
           family.  He was arrested in March 1991 and accused of  assisting
           the LTTE.  He was detained for 2� years  at  Malwata  camp.  The
           camp was attacked by the LTTE in 1995.  The army  evacuated  the
           camp as it had been successfully captured by the LTTE.  The LTTE
           took over the prisoners who were previously under the custody of
           the army.  He had to stay with other young  prisoners  with  the
           LTTE. He was detained by the LTTE in the same camp for a  period
           of two years. He was forced  to  do  chores,  like  cooking  and
           attending to injured persons. He was not happy  with  this  work
           and he asked the LTTE to release him.  They  told  him  that  as
           they had assisted him in getting out of the army jail he  should
           assist them as well.


      (b)   In June 1995, he managed to escape from the LTTE  camp  and  he
           returned to his  home  in  Koddaikallauve.   He  remained  there
           until, one day in 1998 he was passing through a checkpoint,  and
           the army arrested him.  They accused him of having assisted  the
           LTTE. They soon discovered that he had been in Malwata camp  and
           that he had thereafter been taken under the control of the  LTTE
           when the camp was attacked.  They severely ill-treated him.


      (c)   Because of the ill-treatment he revealed all that had  happened
           to him after the LTTE took over the camp at  Malwata.   He  also
           took the army on indications of all secret locations he had been
           to with the LTTE.  He managed to escape from the  army  for  one
           day, after he had been asked to  go  and  collect  firewood.  He
           immediately proceeded to the house of a Muslim friend  where  he
           remained in hiding for one month until he made contact with  his
           father.  His father came to see him and told him that  the  army
           were looking for him at his house.  He also  informed  him  that
           the LTTE were angry with him because they were aware that he had
           divulged information to the army. His  father  told  him  in  no
           uncertain terms that he could not return to  his  home  village.
           The appellant therefore decided to flee for his life.   He  went
           to Colombo on 26 June 2000.


      (d)   The following  morning  his  father  met  him  in  Colombo  and
           arranged for his journey to leave the country.  He did so on  30
           June 2000."


16.   The sentence, "he managed to escape from the army for one  day  after
      he had been asked to go and collect firewood" appears to  contain  an
      error.  It only makes sense if read, "he managed to escape  from  the
      army one day....".  It is not suggested that he escaped for  one  day
      and  was  then  recaptured;  he  has  never  been  recaptured.    The
      circumstances of  the  appellant's  escape  are  important.   In  his
      witness statement dated 1 August 2000 the appellant said  that  after
      he helped the authorities, "After that they had been nice to  me  but
      still refused to release me.  While I was in the  forest  camp.   One
      day I sent to collect (sic) fireworks [presumably  firewood].  During
      this time I managed to escape from them...".  In  his  interview  the
      appellant said that he was not ill-treated after he gave  information
      to the authorities.  He was kept  at  the  camp  in  the  forest  and
      escaped whilst chopping firewood when the guard or guards were drunk.



17.   The appellant was never charged or convicted.  He  was  not  formally
      sentenced to  any  period  of  imprisonment.   After  he  helped  the
      authorities he was not ill-treated.  He appears to have been kept  in
      informal and far from close custody in a camp in the forest.

18.   Mr Murphy referred us to paragraphs 6.62, 6.64 and 6.71 of the  April
      2004 Sri Lanka Country Report.   We accept what is said in  paragraph
      6.62 as to the availability of computerised and  paper  records,  but
      the appellant has not shown that he was formally  arrested.   He  was
      held in informal custody before the ceasefire. The appellant has  not
      shown that the authorities will regard him  as  having  committed  an
      offence.  He has not  claimed  that  he  has  been  convicted  of  an
      offence.  Mr Murphy submitted that the offence  would  be  an  escape
      from custody.  He has not referred us to any information which  might
      lead us to the conclusion that  escape  from  such  informal  custody
      amounts to an offence under Sri Lankan law.

19.    Current  country   conditions   and   the   appellant's   particular
      circumstances are such that it was open to the Adjudicator to come to
      the conclusion that the appellant would not be identified as a wanted
      man on return to Sri  Lanka  and  would  not  be  at  risk  from  the
      authorities,  either  immediately  on  arrival  at  the  airport   or
      subsequently.  The Adjudicator reached conclusions open to him on the
      evidence and there is no error of law.  We dismiss this appeal.




                                                                 P R Moulden
