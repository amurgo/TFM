                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal to the Upper Tribunal, with permission,  in  relation
    to a decision and reasons of the First-tier Tribunal  (Judge  Chambers)
    promulgated on the 4th March 2015 in which he dismissed the Appellant's
    appeal against the Secretary of State's decision to refuse  his  asylum
    claim.   Judge  Chambers  heard  the  appeal  on  18th  February   2015
    immediately after he had heard the appeal of this  Appellant's  sister.
    They were heard separately due to sensitive  issues  but  largely  were
    based on the fact that they claimed to be undocumented Bidoons.

 2. This Appellant was born on  [  ]  1991  in  Kuwait.   He  claimed  that
    although he had attended school he had only done so as an onlooker  and
    did not participate in lessons.  He has a father, mother, two  brothers
    and seven sisters in Kuwait.  He worked selling  watermelons.   He  was
    not registered with the Bidoon committee and had not been issued with a
    security card.  He  possessed  no  documents.   He  said  that  he  had
    participated  in  demonstrations  two   years   previously   when   the
    authorities attacked protesters using tear gas and water cannons but he
    was not injured.

 3. He claimed that in 2013 he was stopped in  the  street  and  asked  for
    documentation and was arrested when he was unable to present  any.   He
    claimed to have been taken to a police station and  detained  for  five
    days during which time he was repeatedly  beaten  sustaining  a  broken
    nose.  He received treatment in a private hospital and he  left  Kuwait
    with his sister, the Appellant in the other appeal, on  passports  that
    she had obtained.

 4. The Judge set out the evidence before him at Paragraphs 8 to 10 of  the
    Decision and Reasons.  He noted that the Appellant adopted the contents
    of his statement and  confirmed  that  he  had  attended  school  as  a
    "listener".  He did not take exams.  He was not graded.  He did not get
    any certificates.  He said that the family landlord was a close  friend
    of his father and he assisted with school fees.  He  said  that  people
    had harassed and thrown stones at him and that he had  sold  vegetables
    and melons.  He undertook no studies and he paid the landlord back from
    the profits from his sale of melons.  He has lived a difficult life  in
    Kuwait and described his arrest and mistreatment  by  the  police.   He
    confirmed that he had received private hospital treatment  and  further
    treatment when the landlord loaned him  the  money  for  it.   When  he
    discovered that his sister and child were intending to leave Kuwait  he
    spoke to his father who advised him to go with her.

 5. He said that he did not know where they were going.   He  knew  nothing
    about the travel arrangements.  He was told that passports  were  ready
    but given no details.  After his asylum  interview  the  Appellant  had
    discovered that the authorities were looking for him and that they  had
    arrested the father.

 6. He claimed to know nothing about being an undocumented Bidoon  and  had
    had no conversations about the arrangements for leaving Kuwait with his
    family.  He knew nothing about what an Article 17 passport was  and  he
    said that his sister had sorted everything out.   The  Judge  dismissed
    the appeal based partly on  the  findings  that  he  had  made  in  his
    sister's case on the basis that having genuine documentation, they were
    not undocumented  Bidoons.   He  also  noted  that  the  Appellant  had
    received medical  treatment  on  two  occasions.   He  also  found  the
    Appellant receiving private education and medical care and  his  sister
    having various  paid  employments  and  earning  more  money  than  her
    husband.  He said their lives in Kuwait were more consistent with  them
    being documented Bidoons than  undocumented  Bidoons  and  as  such  he
    dismissed the appeal.

 7. The grounds giving rise to the grant of permission  to  appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal argue  that  the  Judge  rejected  the  claim  that  the
    Appellant knew nothing about the  travel  arrangements  without  giving
    reasons.  It was explained  at  the  hearing  that  the  Appellant  was
    thirteen years younger than his sister and it  was  entirely  plausible
    she would make all the arrangements and not discuss them with her.   It
    is claimed that the Judge failed to engage properly with  the  evidence
    and relied upon flawed findings made in the sisters appeal  to  justify
    his conclusion in this.  It is claimed that the Judge  failed  to  give
    clear reasons why he rejected the Appellant's contention that  he  knew
    nothing about the travel arrangements which was  a  material  error  of
    law.

 8. It is then said in the second ground that the Judge  erred  in  stating
    that the Appellant had received a private education when  he  had  not.
    It was also an error to rely upon the fact that the Appellant  received
    private medical treatment  when  that  is,  according  to  the  country
    information,  all  that  is  available  to  undocumented  Bidoons   and
    therefore the fact that  he  received  private  treatment  corroborated
    rather than contradicted his claim.

 9. The third ground says that the Judge's findings were in relation to the
    claimed arrest and ill-treatment were wholly inadequate.

10. The Presenting Officer adopted the same arguments in relation  to  this
    Appellant as he had in the  sister's.   Provided  the  Judge  had  good
    reason for finding them to be documented Bidoons, which  he  argued  he
    did, then the rest of the case fell away.  The  Judge  simply  did  not
    accept that this young man of twenty-three was as naï¿½ve as claimed.  He
    agreed with Miss Faryl's submissions that the fact that he had received
    private  medical  treatment  did  not  contradict  the  claim   to   be
    undocumented Bidoons but however the  other  reasons  for  the  Judge's
    decision were entirely sustainable and therefore the error in  relation
    to private medical treatment was not material.

Findings

11. Having looked carefully at the Judge's decision it is  clear  that  the
    Judge found for good reason that the Appellant and his sister were both
    documented Bidoons.


12.       In  the  Judge's  findings  in  the  sister's  appeal  he  clearly
    recognised  the  difference  between  a  Security  card  and  a   Civil
    Identification document and he reminded himself of  that  at  paragraph
    22.  He noted at paragraph 23 that the objective information shows that
    undocumented Bidoons have a very low standard of living and subsist  by
    selling fruit etc.  He then went on to note  that  the  fact  that  the
    Appellant in this case had quite well paid employment was  inconsistent
    with the general picture.  He noted the Appellant  explained  that  she
    had  been  paid  in  cash  and  was  assisted  by  friends  in  getting
    employment.  However, she was well paid in the sense that she  received
    more money than her husband.  She enjoyed a  reasonable  lifestyle  and
    although this might have  been  explained  by  having  connections  and
    living on her wits, he noted that another view was the  fact  that  she
    had such a lifestyle was consistent with her being a documented Bidoon.



13.      In the next paragraph of  the  sister's  Decision  and  Reasons  he
    pointed out that the case the sister presented was  that  she  and  her
    brother were undocumented Bidoons who wished  to  escape  Kuwait  using
    false passports.  He noted that handing those false passports to the UK
    authorities would have proved her case.  However, she did not  do  that
    but destroyed the passports by ripping them up and  flushed  them  down
    the toilet on the plane.  They then waited in the airport  until  there
    was no  prospect  of  the  Secretary  of  State  getting  hold  of  the
    passports.  He also  noted  that  in  her  interview  she  claimed  the
    passports were genuine.

14.      At paragraph 26 of the sister's  Decision  and  Reasons  the  Judge
    reiterated the fact that the Appellant had quite deliberately destroyed
    the documents which would have proved the case one way  or  the  other.
    Destroying false passports was inconsistent with her claim and  on  the
    basis  of  her  having  destroyed  documents  and  living  a  lifestyle
    inconsistent with that of an undocumented Bidoon he found that she  was
    not.  On the basis of the evidence the Judge was entitled to form  that
    view.  The sister had changed her case over time.  She  initially  said
    at interview that she had obtained the passport herself by paying a fee
    and attending the authorities and that it was a genuine document.   She
    then claimed that it  was  a  genuine  document  but  obtained  through
    bribery.  In either event that would mean that  she  was  a  documented
    Bidoon and not an undocumented Bidoon.  I found  no material  error  of
    law in the Judge's reasoning in that regard and the Judge was  entitled
    to use that finding to find this  Appellant  was  not  an  undocumented
    Bidoon.

15.      Having found that the Appellant was a  documented  Bidoon  I  agree
    that that brought the appeal  to  an  end.   His  claim  to  have  been
    arrested and detained as an undocumented Bidoon would fall away on that
    finding and does not require any further scrutiny.   The  Judge  simply
    did not accept that at the  age  of  twenty-three  the  Appellant  knew
    nothing about the arrangements that were being made  or  the  documents
    concerned.  It was the Appellant's own evidence that  he  had  attended
    school and the fees had been paid for that.  The  Judge  found  coupled
    with the education and the documents and the general lifestyle all this
    reinforced the finding that these Appellants  were  documented  Bidoons
    and as such their appeal fell.  I can find  no  error  of  law  in  his
    reasoning.
