                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr T Wilding, HOPO
For the Respondent:    Mr M Murphy, Counsel


                          DECISION ON ERROR OF LAW


1.   The appellant, the Secretary of State, has been granted  permission  to
    appeal the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge  Anstis  allowing  the
    appeal  of  the  respondent  on  the  basis   that   there   would   be
    insurmountable obstacles to family life existing in  Jamaica  resulting
    from the respondent's husband's circumstances.

2.   The respondent is a national of Jamaica born on 23 May 1979.   She  has
    been in the United Kingdom since arrival as a visitor on 6  July  2002.
    She has had no permission to  be  in  the  United  Kingdom  since  that
    visitor visa ran out on 6 January 2003.

3.   Her application for leave to remain on the basis  of  her  relationship
    with Anthony Earl Thompson, a  British  citizen,  was  refused  by  the
    respondent on  27  April  2015.   She  lodged  an  appeal  against  the
    respondent's decision on 6 May 2015.  At the time  of  her  application
    the appellant and Mr  Thompson  were  not  married.   They  have  since
    married on 23 May 2015.

4.   At the date the judge heard the appeal the appellant had  been  in  the
    United Kingdom for thirteen, very close to fourteen years.

5.   Mr Thompson was born in Hackney, London and is a British  citizen.   He
    has three adult children who were born  in  the  United  Kingdom.   His
    daughter, Latoya Thompson, has a son  who  is  12  years  old,  who  is
    autistic and has learning disability.  Latoya Thompson said  that  when
    she has to go to work, shopping, etc., she relies on the respondent  to
    look after her son.

6.   Mr Thompson has two sons, Anton Earl Thompson and Shaun Earl  Thompson.
     Anton Thompson  said  that  he  has  a  6  year  old  daughter.   This
    respondent visits his 6 year old daughter  regularly.   Shaun  Thompson
    said the respondent played an important role in his life as his  second
    mum.

7.   The evidence from the respondent's husband's children was that  if  the
    respondent were to leave the UK for Jamaica, this would  have  a  great
    impact on all of them.

8.   In the Reasons for Refusal Letter  the  Secretary  of  State  mentioned
    that the respondent was cautioned on 25 February 2013 for attempting to
    obtain property by deception, an immigration offence to which she tried
    to gain leave through forgery, insofar as she deliberately with  intent
    paid ï¿½1,500 to a third party attempting to obtain a forged GBR passport
    on her behalf.  The  judge  heard  evidence  from  the  respondent  who
    explained that no money changed hands and that it was a one-off  matter
    in difficult circumstances.  The Secretary of State was not represented
    at the hearing and therefore the judge did not have any particulars  of
    the offence other than what was set out in the refusal letter.

9.   The judge accepted the respondent's evidence that this  was  a  one-off
    offence in difficult circumstances.   The  judge  considered  that  the
    offence in those circumstances did not meet the standard  in  S-LTR.1.6
    of showing that her presence in the United Kingdom is not conducive  to
    the public good.  The judge found that S-LTR.1.6 does not apply in  the
    respondent's situation.

10.  The judge then made the following findings:

         "36. EX.1(b) applies if:


                  'the applicant has a genuine and  subsisting  relationship
                  with a partner who is in the UK and is a  British  Citizen
                  ... and there are insurmountable obstacles to family  life
                  with that partner continuing outside the UK.'


         37.  'Insurmountable obstacles' is defined in EX.2 as follows:


                  'insurmountable  obstacles'  means  the  very  significant
                  difficulties which would be  faced  by  the  applicant  or
                  their partner in continuing  their  family  life  together
                  outside the UK and which could not be  overcome  or  would
                  entail very serious hardship for the  applicant  or  their
                  partner.'


         38.  The Appellant  spent  the  formative  years  of  her  life  in
             Jamaica.  Despite the loss of her family  connections  in  the
             United Kingdom and the fact that she no longer has any  family
             connections in Jamaica, I do not consider that she would  face
             'very  significant  difficulties'  on  a  return  to  Jamaica.
             However, I must also consider the position of her husband.  He
             has been in the  United  Kingdom  all  his  life  and  has  no
             experience of life in Jamaica at  all.   All  his  family  and
             connections are in the United Kingdom.  I am  satisfied  that,
             even with the benefit of  returning  with  the  Appellant,  he
             would face 'very significant difficulties' in  continuing  his
             family life with the Appellant in Jamaica, and that this would
             entail 'very serious hardship' for him.  This  is  because  he
             would  be  separated  from  his  children,  grandchildren  and
             elderly mother, and in a foreign environment that  he  has  no
             previous experience of or connections with.


         39.  The Appellant's application thus meets the requirements of the
             Immigration Rules.


         40.  As the Respondent's decision is not  in  accordance  with  the
             Immigration Rules, it is not in accordance with law  at  point
             (3) of Razgar, and the appeal must be allowed on human  rights
             grounds".


11.  Permission was granted to  the  appellant  on  the  basis  that  it  is
    arguable that the judge's decision that there would  be  insurmountable
    obstacles to family life (in the context of EX.1) existing  in  Jamaica
    resulting from the respondent's  husband's  circumstances  is  arguably
    inadequately reasoned and a misapplication of Agyarko [2015]  EWCA  Civ
    440.  The grant of permission went on to say that the judge allowed the
    appeal outside the Rules, but the assessment was arguably  informed  by
    the decision in respect of EX.1.

12.  Mr Wilding relied on the grounds of appeal.  In  particular,  ground  1
    which argued that the judge misdirected  himself  when  he  found  that
    there were insurmountable obstacles  to  the  respondent  returning  to
    Jamaica.  He submitted that this ground stems from paragraph 21 and  25
    of Agyarko and Others, R (on the application of) v Secretary  of  State
    for the Home Department [2015] EWCA Civ 440:-

         "21.  The  phrase  'insurmountable  obstacles'  as  used  in   this
             paragraph of the Rules clearly imposes a  high  hurdle  to  be
             overcome by an applicant for leave to remain under the  Rules.
             The test is significantly more demanding than a mere  test  of
             whether it would be reasonable to expect a couple to  continue
             their family life outside the United Kingdom.


         25.  The statement made in Mrs Agyarko's letter of  application  of
             26 September 2012 that 'she may be separated from' her husband
             was very weak, and was not supported  by  any  evidence  which
             might lead to the  conclusion  that  insurmountable  obstacles
             existed to them pursuing their family  life  overseas.   There
             was no witness statement from Mrs Agyarko  or  Mr  Benette  to
             explain what obstacles might exist.  The mere  facts  that  Mr
             Benette is a British citizen, has lived all his  life  in  the
             United Kingdom and has a job here - and hence  might  find  it
             difficult and might be reluctant  to  re-locate  to  Ghana  to
             continue their  family  life  there  -  could  not  constitute
             insurmountable obstacles to his doing so".


13.  Mr Wilding said that paragraph 25 of Agyarko is exactly  and  the  only
    reason given by the judge for finding that  the  Rules  are  met.   The
    judge's reasons at paragraph 38 fall squarely  with  what  is  said  in
    Agyarko and cannot constitute  insurmountable  obstacles.   Mr  Wilding
    said that this is plain and simply a material error of law.

14.  His  second  argument  was  that  this  finding  infected  the  judge's
    consideration outside the Rules.  At paragraph 49 of the  determination
    the judge said as follows:

         "I note Mr Osadebe's submission that in EB  (Kosovo)  it  was  said
         that the correct approach to such issues under  Article  8  was  to
         consider whether it was 'reasonable' for the Appellant's husband to
         be expected to leave the country, rather than  whether  there  were
         'insurmountable  obstacles'.   I  have  already  found  there   are
         'insurmountable obstacles' to the Appellant's husband  leaving  the
         country, so it must follow that it is unreasonable to expect him to
         leave the country".


15.  Mr Wilding submitted that in the light of Agyarko the  judge's  finding
    at paragraph 49 is also a material error.

16.  The third ground raised by Mr Wilding was that  the  respondent  had  a
    duty of candour to disclose that a previous appeal had  been  dismissed
    in August 2014.  In that decision it  was  found  that  there  were  no
    insurmountable obstacles to the respondent returning  to  Jamaica.   He
    placed reliance on Khan, R (on the application of) v Secretary of State
    for the  Home  Department  [2016]  EWCA  Civ  416  to  argue  that  the
    respondent was under a duty  of  candour  to  provide  a  copy  of  the
    determination so as to allow the judge to consider what weight, if any,
    to place on the determination.  Mr Wilding submitted that  the  failure
    to draw the judge's attention to it lies equally with the respondent as
    well as the appellant.  Although this was not a central feature of  the
    case, it was a feature which should have  been  drawn  to  the  judge's
    attention.

17.  Mr Murphy submitted that the first ground  is  the  reasons  challenge.
    He submitted that the Agyarko case was a judicial review.  There was no
    issue of children as was the issue in this  case.   He  submitted  that
    this case is distinct from Agyarko.   There  are  factual  differences.
    One child suffers from autism and the respondent as a grandparent looks
    after this child.  This was not a feature in  the  Agyarko  case.   The
    judge took into account the respondent's involvement  with  this  child
    and did not err in taking into account the best interest of this child.
     The judge considered the appeal in the light  of  Razgar.   The  judge
    also considered the caution.  The judge applied the  correct  test  and
    found that the respondent's husband met the test.

18.  With regard to the duty of candour, Mr Murphy submitted that  this  was
    not mentioned in the Reasons for Refusal Letter issued by the Secretary
    of State.  There was no HOPO present at the hearing.  He submitted that
    Khan was a judicial  review  decision  where  a  duty  of  candour  was
    required by the applicant.  He submitted that this appeal process is an
    adversarial process.  The respondent brought the previous determination
    to the  attention  of  the  judge  by  mentioning  it  in  her  witness
    statement.  But even if she did not bring it to the  attention  of  the
    judge, she did not have to.

19.  I was not persuaded by Mr Murphy's argument.  I found  that  the  judge
    made material errors of law, such that the decision could not stand.

20.  I found that the judge's decision at paragraph 38 fell squarely  within
    paragraph 25 of Agyarko.

21.  I also found that the judge's reasoning infected her finding  that  the
    respondent's appeal succeeded outside the Rules in terms of  Article  8
    of the ECHR.  These errors are material.

22.  As regards the argument  that  the  respondent  was  under  a  duty  of
    candour to disclose an earlier determination dated 5 September 2014  to
    the judge, I find that the duty  of  candour  applies  equally  to  the
    Secretary of State and the respondent.  I find  that  the  respondent's
    mention of the earlier determination in her witness statement  was  not
    sufficient.  As the earlier determination decided  that  there  was  no
    insurmountable obstacles to respondent returning to Jamaica, and it was
    important for the earlier determination to have  been  brought  to  the
    attention of this judge, so as to allow him to consider what weight, if
    any, to place on that finding.

23.  I find that the errors made by the judge  are  material  and  therefore
    his decision cannot stand.

24.  Mr Murphy submitted that further evidence would need  to  be  given  in
    this appeal and therefore it would be appropriate to  remit  this  case
    back to the First-tier for a rehearing by a different judge.

25.  Accordingly, the appeal is remitted to Taylor House for rehearing by  a
    judge other than First-tier Tribunal Judge Anstis.


No anonymity direction is made.
