For the Appellant:     Mr A Caskie, Advocate, instructed by Katani & Co,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Diwnycz, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. FtT Judge Buchanan dismissed the appellant's  appeal  by  his  decision
    promulgated on 3 February 2020.  That was set aside by the decision  UT
    Judge Rintoul, promulgated on 27 October 2020,  which  is  to  be  read
    herewith.  Pursuant to a transfer order made on  4  January  2021,  the
    case came before me for remaking of the decision of the FtT.

 2. The primary facts were not disputed at the hearing.

 3. In an application to the respondent  (UKVI)  dated  5  April  2011  the
    appellant stated earnings from 1  May  2010  to  28  February  2011  of
    �35,764.

 4. On 27 January 2012 the appellant declared to  HM  Revenue  and  Customs
    (HMRC) of �5,700 for the tax year 2010 - 11.

 5. In an application to UKVI dated 11 June 2013 the appellant stated total
    earnings of �36,080.

 6. On 31 January 2014 the appellant declared net profit of �0.00  to  HMRC
    for 2012 - 13.

 7. On 28 December 2015 the appellant amended her net profit  to  HMRC  for
    2012 - 13 to �21,378.

 8. On 16 June 2016 the appellant applied for indefinite leave to remain as
    a tier 1 general migrant.  She amended that on 22 December 2018  to  an
    application based on long residence.

 9. On 18 December 2016 the appellant amended her net profit  to  HMRC  for
    2010 - 11 to �35,764.

10. Due to concerns over her  financial  declarations,  the  appellant  was
    interviewed by the respondent on 18 January 2017.  Her explanation  was
    that she made a mistake due to lack of knowledge of the tax system and,
    to save money, she did not have an accountant at the time.

11. The respondent refused the appellant's application  on  14  June  2019,
    based, in terms of paragraphs 276B and 322(5) of the immigration rules,
    on the undesirability of permitting her to remain  in  the  UK  in  the
    light of her conduct and character.

12. The respondent's decision, at page 5 of 12, says that  the  appellant's
    explanation has been considered,  but  it  was  her  responsibility  to
    ensure tax was paid and to engage an accountant if necessary, and  "The
    fact that you wanted to save  money  does  not  excuse  you  from  this
    responsibility".

13. In  the  next  paragraph,  at  page  6,  the  decision  says  that  the
    appellant's explanation is "not accepted", without further comment.  It
    is held that the appellant either misrepresented her earnings  to  HMRC
    to reduce her liability, or gave false information to  UKVI  to  obtain
    leave, or both.

14. The appellant's fuller explanation in course of her appeal is  that  an
    anticipated business expense of �30,000 was included in  her  accounts,
    legitimately, although not yet incurred; the related  transaction  fell
    through; the item was mistakenly carried forward; and  the  matter  was
    later identified and corrected.

15. Mr Caskie submitted that some element of discrepancy could be explained
    by  the  differences  between  the  reporting   periods.    There   are
    differences between the intervals for which income needs to  be  stated
    to HMRC and to UKVI, but I am unable to see any relevance in this case.



16. The principal oversight which led to the decision of the FtT being  set
    aside was that there was evidence of  the  existence  of  the  proposed
    transaction and of the initial expense to which the appellant would  be
    put.  This is in the form of an email  from  a  Singapore  company,  KS
    Logistics, about a proposed business trip, with a budget of �30,000  to
    be covered initially by the appellant.  This arrangement was  cancelled
    "at the last minute in June 2011".

17. Mr Diwnycz accepted that given the lapse of time, it was not adverse to
    the appellant that she had not  produced  original  working  papers  or
    Excel documents underlying her declarations; and  he  did  not  dissent
    from the observation of Judge Rintoul that use of a  spreadsheet  as  a
    template might explain how a figure was carried over in error from  one
    year to another.

18.  As  Mr  Caskie  observed,  the  explanation  fits  closely  with   the
    discrepancies; but that does not remove all doubt.

19. The crucial question may be taken from Balajigari [2019] 1 WLR 4647  at
    [35]: whether the discrepancies are the result  of  dishonesty,  or  of
    "mere carelessness or ignorance  ...  Errors  so  caused  are,  however
    regrettable, 'genuine' or 'innocent' in the sense that they are honest,
    and do not meet the necessary threshold".

20. If the appellant engaged in deliberate fraud, that was by inserting and
    maintaining in her tax returns a liability which  was  never  incurred.
    It is adverse that the matter was not corrected for  quite  some  time,
    and was repeated in future years.

21. The analysis in the respondent's decision  is  weak.   At  page  5,  it
    appears to accept that the  explanation  might  be  true;  and  if  so,
    failure to state income accurately and to employ an accountant does not
    reach the threshold required.  Beyond that, at page 6, the decision  is
    framed as if the discrepancies speak for themselves.

22. In some instances, the figures and the timing may be such that  nothing
    else really needs to be said, particularly where it is  the  respondent
    who brings discrepancies to  light;  but  this  case  is  not  at  that
    extreme.  While it is problematic whether a genuine error is likely  to
    have been perpetuated for as long as claimed, it is possible,  and  the
    first correction was made 6 months before the  application  leading  to
    these proceedings.  The discrepancies were not simply discovered by the
    respondent.

23. There was enough before the respondent to draw an initial inference  of
    dishonesty, but, based on on all the evidence and submissions, I am not
    satisfied that the discrepancies which the appellant disclosed were due
    to dishonesty rather than to careless error.

24. Mr Caskie made an  alternative  submission  that  even  on  an  adverse
    finding on financial declarations, the appeal  should  succeed  on  the
    article 8 rights not only of the appellant but of her  partner  and  UK
    citizen child.  There is a  second  stage  to  the  analysis,  but  the
    appellant has not shown anything by which, on a finding of  dishonesty,
    it would be disproportionate to expect her to return to China.

25. The decision  of  the  FtT  has  been  set  aside.   It  has  not  been
    established  that  the  appellant   should   be   refused   leave   for
    undesirability  in  terms  of  paragraph  322(5)  of  the  rules.   The
    respondent does not suggest that her application  failed  to  meet  any
    other requirement, so it would otherwise have succeeded in terms of the
    rules.  It follows that the decision is remade by allowing the  appeal,
    as originally brought to the FtT, on human rights grounds.

26. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
