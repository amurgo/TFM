                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    The appellants have been granted permission to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal against a decision of the First-tier Tribunal which  dismissed
    their appeals against the decision to refuse them  entry  clearance  to
    the UK.

2.    The Upper Tribunal has received a fax dated 16 December 2015 from  the
    appellants' representatives indicating that they wish to withdraw their
    case before the Upper Tribunal.

3.    Rule  17  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
    provides that a party may give notice of the withdrawal of its case  or
    part of it, subject to the consent of the  Upper  Tribunal.  The  Upper
    Tribunal gives its consents to the withdrawal.

4.    In the circumstances the determination of the First-tier  Tribunal  is
    treated as unchallenged.  Accordingly,  the  appeal  before  the  Upper
    Tribunal is dismissed, with the effect that the decision of the  First-
    tier Tribunal shall stand in all respects.
