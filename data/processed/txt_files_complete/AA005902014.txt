Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr M Schwenk, instructed by GM Immigration Aid Unit
For the respondent:    Ms C Johnstone, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Mwila Mupepa, date of birth 12.7.88,  is  a  citizen  of
    Zambia.

 2. This is her appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Brunnen promulgated 18.9.14, dismissing her  appeal  against  the
    decision of the  respondent,  dated  14.1.14,  to  refuse  her  asylum,
    humanitarian protection and human rights claims made in November  2011.
    The Judge heard the appeal on 29.7.14.

 3.  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Bird  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    13.10.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 13.1.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Brunnen should be set aside.

 6. In essence, the grounds of application for permission to appeal  assert
    that the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  not  adequately
    reasoned and the judge's conclusion that the appellant's  circumstances
    did not describe a situation  which  could  properly  be  described  as
    "domestic servitude" did not give reasons why this finding was made.

 7. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Bird noted that the  First-tier
    Tribunal considered the question of domestic servitude  from  �25.  The
    judge did not accept the appellant's account that she was the victim of
    trafficking and gave reasons in �27  and  �28.  The  judge  noted  that
    whilst the Competent  Authority  found  that  the  appellant  had  been
    recruited and transported to the UK and that she was  at  that  time  a
    minor (aged 15) who was unable to give informed  consent,  it  was  not
    accepted that the appellant had been transported  for  the  purpose  of
    domestic servitude. Judge Bird suggests that no reasons were given  for
    this conclusion, noting only that the Competent Authority had found  no
    other evidence to corroborate the appellant's account and that  it  did
    not meet the evidentiary threshold.

 8. "It is arguable that in failing to take into  account  the  appellant's
    evidence as to why there had been no police investigation  the  judge's
    conclusion to accept the above  decision  of  the  Competent  Authority
    without adequate reasons (see paragraph 18 of the determination) is  an
    arguable error of law."

 9. The grounds further allege that the judge's findings did not take  into
    account the appellant's evidence that she had been continually raped by
    the boyfriend of  her  carer  in  Zambia  from  the  age  of  12.  "His
    conclusion that the appellant could be returned  to  Zambia  failed  to
    properly consider the historical evidence which in paragraph 29 of  his
    determination is described as "social and domestic difficulty."  It  is
    alleged  that  the  judge  failed  to  properly  assess  this  evidence
    therefore an arguable error of law arises as the judge failed to make a
    proper assessment on the appellant's claim for protection (see  grounds
    5 to  10).  The  judge  assesses  the  appellant's  circumstances  from
    paragraph 29 onwards and it is  arguable  that  in  his  assessment  he
    failed to properly assess the seriousness of her  evidence  as  to  her
    background in Zambia. An arguable error of law arises."

10. It is clear from the decision that the judge made a careful  assessment
    of the appellant's claim, setting it out between  �6  and  �22  of  the
    decision. Mr Nicholson's submissions were also summarised  at  �25-�27,
    contending that the appellant had been trafficked to the UK and was  at
    risk of being trafficked again on return.

11. The grant of permission suggests that at �27 the judge gave no  reasons
    for  accepting  the  decision  of  the  Competent  Authority  that  the
    appellant had not been transported for domestic servitude. That is  not
    accurate. A reading of �27 discloses the reasons,  which  include  that
    there had been no police investigation. Indeed, at �18 the judge  noted
    she had been invited as part of the asylum process  to  report  Patrick
    and Celine to the police for trafficking, but she declined to do so, in
    part because of the way she had been arrested the last time she went to
    the police but more significantly because she was very attached to  the
    children and thus did not want to pursue the matter. The  other  reason
    was that there was no other evidence to  corroborate  her  account  and
    thus it did not meet the evidentiary threshold. The judge  went  on  to
    explain why he rejected Mr  Nicholson's  submission  and  to  find  the
    decision of the Competent Authority rational.  However,  the  reasoning
    continues in �28 and �29, assessing  the  content  of  the  appellant's
    account  and  concluding  that  the  appellant  was  not  in   domestic
    servitude, did not escape from domestic servitude, and in fact came  to
    the UK willingly and keenly.

12. Mr Schwenk pointed me to the lengthy competent  authority  guidance  on
    trafficking and suggested that the appellant's  account  was  'replete'
    with indicators of trafficking. I have specifically  considered  p15-17
    and the list of questions which may reveal evidence of coercion; p24-25
    and the definition of forced labour; the guidance at p28 as to domestic
    servitude;  p31  and  the  myth  that  as  the  person  did  not   take
    opportunities to escape so is not being coerced; and p66 guidance as to
    identifying victims who don't self-identify. There are  certainly  some
    factors that may support a conclusion of  domestic  servitude,  as  the
    judge accepted, but at �28 the judge  found  significant  factors  that
    were inconsistent with domestic servitude.  Assessing  the  appellant's
    evidence as a  whole  the  judge  found  that  the  claim  of  domestic
    servitude was not made out.

13. My attention was also directed to EK (Article 4 ECHR:  Anti-Trafficking
    Convention) Tanzania [2013] 00313 (IAC), which held that  there  is  no
    distinction between a domestic worker who  was  trafficked  by  way  of
    forced labour and one who arrived voluntarily and was then subjected to
    forced labour. However, the  judge  reached  the  conclusion  that  the
    appellant was not subjected to forced labour as a domestic worker.

14. The Rule 24 response, dated 12.11.14, points out  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge took into account an  array  of  factors,  such  as  the
    appellant being fed and clothed [28], provision of a  mobile  phone  to
    contact family [11], enrol in college  [15],  the  ability  to  go  out
    socially to "meet  good  people"  [23]  and  indeed  engage  in  casual
    encounters [13-16]. Allied to this was the negative conclusion  by  the
    competent authority in the "conclusive  grounds  decision"  [20].   The
    appellant had access to her passport and ID, and to the outside  world,
    where she was free to form friendships  with  others.  The  judge  also
    considered the reasons given by the appellant  for  not  reporting  the
    matter to the police and was entitled to take into account that she did
    not do so, despite the fact that the address and  identity  were  fully
    known to her. Obviously, such an assessment is a balancing exercise  in
    which the judge has to reach a decision one way or the other. This is a
    process entirely within the

15. I find that the judge has provided cogent reasons  for  the  conclusion
    that the appellant was not trafficked for domestic servitude, assessing
    the issue before him and reaching conclusions which were open to him on
    the evidence. There was some evidence going both ways, but it  was  the
    task of the judge to decide the issue on the basis of the evidence as a
    whole. It  cannot  be  said  that  his  findings  and  conclusion  were
    irrational or perverse. Whilst a different judge  may  have  reached  a
    different conclusion, this was an assessment that was open to the judge
    to make, one within the judge's province and duty. In this  regard  the
    grounds of appeal are nothing more and nothing less than  disagreement,
    a simple quarrel with the Judge's assessment of the various  pieces  of
    evidence considered and ensuing findings.

16. Similarly, the criticisms of the judge's findings and  remarks  at  �29
    and  �30,  are  further  disagreements  with  findings.  The  judge  is
    criticised for referring to 'social and domestic difficulty' in Zambia,
    when it was the appellant's case that she had been repeatedly raped  by
    her carer's boyfriend, a  claim  noted  by  the  judge  at  �8  of  the
    decision. The grounds at �10  submit  that  it  would  be  inhuman  and
    degrading treatment to return the appellant to "a place where  memories
    of that horrendous treatment would be invoked and  where  the  A  would
    have little or no support mechanism available to  assist  her  and  her
    child, who himself has development needs which might  not  be  met."  I
    find no satisfactory evidential support for such a  submission.  It  is
    suggested that it was incumbent on the judge to make  findings  on  the
    allegations of rape and without doing so it the conclusion that  whilst
    her fears might invoke sympathy, they did not involve a risk of inhuman
    or degrading treatment. I disagree; there  was  no  evidence  that  the
    appellant, now an adult with her own child, would be  at  any  risk  of
    similar treatment  in  Zambia  by  reason  of  having  previously  been
    subjected to rape. She would not be returning to  the  same  carer  and
    would not be in the household of the alleged rapist.  One  has  to  ask
    what the risk was, surely not one of being reminded  of  past  rape  by
    merely being in the same country, as appears to  be  suggested  in  the
    grounds and submissions. Even if true, including the matters summarised
    at �23, the judge found that there was insufficient in the  appellant's
    account of events in Zambia that would amount to a Convention reason or
    demonstrate any real risk of  suffering  serious  harm  or  inhuman  or
    degrading treatment or punishment. I find those conclusions  were  open
    to the judge on the limited evidence before him and can see  no  likely
    difference whether or not a specific finding was made as to whether she
    had been repeatedly raped as claimed. Simply put, there was no credible
    evidence that she would be at risk on return.

Conclusion & Decision:

17. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed on all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.




Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable and thus there can be no fee award.
