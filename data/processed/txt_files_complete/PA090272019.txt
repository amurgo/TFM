                          DETERMINATION BY CONSENT

    Both parties having complied with the directions  sent  on  20th  April
    2020 and both parties being in agreement that the decision of FtT Judge
    A J Parker discloses errors of law such that the decision is to be  set
    aside to be remade, such remaking to be before the First-tier Tribunal

    Pursuant to Rule 39 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 the following order is made:

         Upon the determination by First-Tier  Tribunal  Judge  A  J  Parker
         promulgated on 6th November 2019 disclosing a material error of law
         and being set aside on 7th May 2020.

         And upon the parties agreeing  that  the  appeal  should  be  heard
         afresh the appeal by the  appellant  against  the  refusal  of  his
         protection claim is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal.

    The appeal in the Upper Tribunal is allowed.  The decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal is set aside for legal error.   The  appeal  against  the
    decision giving rise to the appeal  is  remitted  to  be  heard  afresh
    before the First-tier Tribunal with no findings preserved.
